Guys,

As of this morning, these are the counterparties that are not trading with us:

BHP Billiton--no coal, yes vessels

Koch-generally no crude and products, but they have traded some small weather products.

Shell  (Stasco, Equiva)--no trades

Bank of Montreal--no trades  (started several weeks ago)

Phibro--appear to be no trades, but hard to confirm

BP--no trades.

Diamond Shamrock has a very small spread position on with us, and asked us to find someone to stand between.

Sempra is looking at their exposure to us in physical products, and asking questions about our docs.

Innogy--In Europe, no longer trading weather with us.

ICE--The Majors have cut us off.

More info to follow as discovered.

As you guys go through working up a severance program, I started thinking about some equity issues.  If the average tenure of an employee at Enron is about 3 years, why not come up with 2 plans--1 for long serving employees who have been long dedicated to the company, and a second one for the more recently hired?  It doesnt' make sense to me that someone who has been here under a year at $100,000 base should be entitled to 11 weeks even before they sign the waiver.  I would also not change the program in whatever form you ultimately settle on for the longer serving employees, rather just scale back the program for the newer employees.

Regards,

Jeff

Jeff,

This pricing scheme would not work for EGM because of the 1,000,000 annual transaction count minimum "Take or Pay".  

Here's how this would price if applied to EGM in 2001;

Total 2001 Estimated # of EGM EOL transactions = 77,613  (YTD September # of EOL transactions = 56,613,
                                                                                         Estimate 4Q # of EOL transactions = 21,000)

2001 Estimate cost @ $8.00/trade = $620,904     (77,613 trades)
2001 Take or Pay Cost                  $7,379,096    (Shortfall of 922,387 trades @ $8/trade)
                                                    ----------------
Total 2001 Cost                             $8,000,000                            

2002 Plan as submitted by EOL Group = $5,779,076

We can't wait for another meeting - we are in front of the OOC on Monday with the Enron Americas plan.

Here's my numbers (I got them from etrade!!!!!):

0 - 5000 transactions per day		$  8:00/normal transaction (including internals)
> 5,000 transactions			$ 10:00/normal transaction 
Options					$ 10:00/ per option (using option grid)
Take or Pay				Minumum Number of transactions per annum = 1,000,000
Service Interruption (outage)		Reduction in our bill of $100,000		(less than 30 minutes)
					Reduction in our bill of $500,000		(greater then 30 minutes)
Per product type set up 			0		(its in your interest as the number of transactions is high in ENA.  It think this issue is for other groups.)
On development 			0		(its in your interest - I think this again an issue for other groups.)

Now we all have the same incentive - grow the number of trades. I think this is pretty close for us.  Only paying once for a sleeve trade.

Let the games begin!

Louise

As you each have heard over the past few days, EnronOnline is currently looking at a new methodology for charging the business units for services in 2002.  We intend to move away from an allocation mindset into one where services (in the form of products, transactions, and development) are charged on a usage basis, allowing the business units to scale and develop their markets in a more cost responsive way.  My assistant will be contacting your offices to schedule 30 minutes with each of you on Friday, Oct 19th to go over the proposed plan and discuss its impact on next year's budget.  I am confident that this process will yield a method that accurately reflects the cost of EnronOnline and allows each of you to make sound financial decisions about your plans to use EnronOnline in 2002.

Please don't hesitate to call me before Friday with questions, and I look forward to meeting with you.

Brad Richter

Most of you are probably aware in the past crude and products mid-market deals were worked thru the ENA	Gas Mid Market group under Fred Lagrasta and Craig Breslau.  For the past 3 months we've been in the process of transitioning the final accounts from ENA over to EGM Mid-Marketing under Bill Berkeland.  Going forward it will be extremely helpful for everyone to focus on this business in EGM.  If you get any requests to price deals for crude, products, pet-chems or plastics from ENA please refer the contact to either Bill Berkeland or myself BEFORE providing any prices.  It's important to EGM's business plan and earnings targets that these transactions are managed by and credited to EGM.  Thanks for everyone's support.

Fred, is there any good reason why Craig & co are working FEDNAV (a Canadian Shipping co.) as opposed to referring them to my group? I,m getting word thru our london desk that Craig did a deal with them a few weeks ago and may be working another one thru Chris Figueroa today. As we go down the path here, we need to get your guys referring products customers to us as we have been referring gas guys to your shop. Through the years of your group's marketing efforts, there are quite a few prospects out there that have contact info pointing to your group and we need to be able to count on you to point them to us. The customer transition issues that we are working don't just apply to the named few we are talking about, but also to new contacts as well.

Thanks.

Performance-Based  Ratemaking Conference
December  5-7, 2001, Denver, CO
OVERVIEW
 

Performance  Based Ratemaking (PBR) is emerging as a key element of the restructuring of the  electric utility industry. For PBR to be effective it must be designed carefully  and uniquely for each utility so as to align the interests of the utility, the  shareholders and the customers and also to make sure that PBR is successful in  achieving efficiency and service quality.
 
EUCI  has put together a covey of expert speakers to review and address the latest PBR  developments and applications.  Join  us in Denver and get the latest state-of-the-art information and insights you  will need to develop an effective PBR strategy for your  company.

Electric  Power Market Performance Conference
December  12-14, 2001, Denver, CO
OVERVIEW
 

Each  year there is additional opportunity to draw lessons regarding electricity  market structure and design from actual market performance. These lessons are  leading to a convergence in market design, at least in the Eastern  Interconnection and ERCOT. One focus of this conference will be on the lessons  to be drawn from the experience of the new ERCOT markets, the continuing market  design problems in California, and the difficulties in developing and  implementing a market based congestion management system in the  midwest.
 
A  second focus of this conference will be on the existing markets in PJM and New  York, which have now moved beyond managing their internal markets and are being  pushed by market participants and regulatory agencies to better address  inter-RTO coordination and develop market based incentive systems for  transmission expansion.
 
Finally, the conference will highlight one of the  important, but little noticed successes of the Eastern ISOs, which is the  explosive growth in the PJM and New York financial rights auctions.

 Electric Risk Management 101 Workshop  
And
Portfolio  Optimization for Electric Utilities Conference
January  22-25, 2001, New York City, NY
OVERVIEW
 

In the current environment of  volatile energy prices and deregulation, it has become increasingly more  important for the electricity industry to learn how to manage price risk. EUCI  presents two events formatted for the beginner to the expert in price risk  management. The first Workshop is designed for the beginner with no prior  experience in risk management and introduces the basic vocabulary and concepts  in a concise and easily understandable format which forms the foundation for the  more advanced concepts applied in the second event (Conference).

Transmission  Expansion and Systems in Transition Conference
Feb.  6-7, 2002, Miami, Florida
OVERVIEW

This conference will examine the  business and regulatory challenges to U.S. electric systems in transition in  effectively expanding transmission capacity to meet new demands in the larger  and more competitive regional markets emerging under FERC's RTO  initiatives.  The conference will  review the parameters of these challenges and possible solutions to them.  It will examine technology options and  new business models for transmission expansion.  It will analyze emerging proposals for  effective transmission planning and pricing, including market-based pricing  alternatives to FERC's traditional pricing methods. The conference will also  discuss what it will take in legislative action and regulatory initiative to  achieve an efficient regime for ensuring that the nation has a reliable grid and  regional trading system.

Jeff,

Tony Galt, of the LNG group, gave two weeks notice last week.  His last day will be October 31st.  Tony functions as the LNG group's marine superintendent, reporting to Tim Nash under Jonathan Whitehead.  It appears that Tim Nash will be picking up these functions for at least the remainder of the year.  Let me know if you would like any further information.

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

I spoke with Gary about this.  As you know the futures market closes at 2, and the cash market closes at 4.  He told me that you and he spoke of this last year, and that he would have the curves out between 3 and 3:30 which he mostly does.  Friday he was working the C$ deal with Zufferili.  I've told he to shoot for 3.
 
Any thoughts?

I have had many complaints over the last year about the inability for the interest rate group to set their curves on time and on a consistant basis.  Every few months I once again ask Puskar (sp) and/or Gary to deal with this.  I am getting very upset.  We have 50 to 100 risk book runners who are forced to work late always siting the interest rate curve as the reaon.

Mike,

I spoke with Joe last night to ensure I understood his personal intentions are for repatriation, and we also talked about the office.

He told me that he has sent out inquiry letters to 4 potential buyers and that he will have a better idea by 12/10 whether anyone is interested.  Joe said that he or Jeremy will continue to provide daily updates.  Until then, Joe has said with the exception of himself and one other expat, there are no reductions scheduled for Japan until we know more about the potential for sale.

Joe said this is what he is operating under for now because he understands he has the authority to explore potential buyers.  If that authority should change, he is prepared to move to immediate shutdown which would take about 3 months.

Shanna

Hello Jeff-
Talked with Larry Lawyer yesterday on proposal for EGM to take  on a small team from the Structured Finance Group.  Larry is on board with  the concept but reserves opinion on the scaleability of the business.  
 
We have retooled the business model to concentrate on bigger  return projects, resulting in a plan that better fits the Enron  formula.  Additionally the skill set of the team (3) will provide  additional value and leverage to existing EGM transactions-especially in the  area of moving assets off balance sheet. Jeremy Thirsk  has first hand knowledge as we have helped structure a Japan trade. Also, Ray Bowen will take on a small team at EIM, as he has bought into  the value return.
 
Larry suggests it is worthwhile for EGM to consider the  proposal further. To this end, I request a meeting with you anytime on  Tuesday or Wednesday next week. I return to London on Thursday.    
Please respond to george.delcanto@enron.com  .
Will forward revised business plan and background material  prior to meeting.
 
thanks and regards,
George

Enron Tries to Dismiss Finance Doubts
By FLOYD NORRIS

Enron (news/quote) has ample access to cash, the company's chief executive said yesterday as he assured investors that there was no need for additional write-offs stemming from unusual financing activities.

In a conference call with investors that was hastily scheduled after Enron's stock plunged on Monday, the chief executive, Kenneth W. Lay, strongly defended the company's chief financial officer and said there was no conflict of interest involved in transactions that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into. 

But he refused to go into detail on the transaction that Enron made with partnerships run by Andrew S. Fastow, the chief financial officer. In addition, Mr. Fastow, while declaring that Enron "expects to continue to have sufficient liquidity to meet normal obligations," declined to answer any questions about it.

The conference call, which began just as trading opened on the New York Stock Exchange, at first seemed to be reassuring investors. Within minutes of the beginning of the call, the share price rallied to $23.25. But it soon began falling, and ended the day down 86 cents, at $19.79. The day's low of $19.62 was the lowest since Jan. 12, 1998, and was down 78 percent from the high set by the stock in the summer of 2000.
Until recently, most investors focused on the company's reported operating earnings, which showed good results as it became a leading player in energy markets. But the focus has shifted to a series of transactions, some involving off-balance- sheet financing. One, involving partnerships controlled by Mr. Fastow, led to a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity that raised concern last week and led to S.E.C. inquiries that the company disclosed on Monday.

One of the company's strongest supporters has been David Fleischer, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs. But he told Mr. Lay on the call yesterday that Enron had to be more forthcoming with information. "There is an appearance that you are hiding something," he said.

After the call, Mr. Fleischer expressed disappointment. "They've engaged in a number of transactions that one wonders about, and that are hard to understand," he said in an interview. "They have not been as forthcoming in explaining them" as is needed, he said. But he said he was still recommending the stock. "I don't think accountants and auditors would have allowed total shenanigans," he said. "In the absence of total shenanigans going on at this company, there is tremendous value here."

Mr. Lay cited the S.E.C. inquiries as a reason for not discussing details on the transactions involving the partnerships that were controlled by Mr. Fastow. But he emphasized that both he and the company's board "continue to have the highest faith and confidence in Andy."

Mr. Lay said that auditors from Arthur Andersen had carefully reviewed Enron's reporting in conjunction with another off-balance-sheet vehicle, called Marlin. That company owns one-third of Azurix (news/quote), an Enron subsidiary that owns Wessex, a British water utility. The auditors "have determined there is no write-down required," he said under questioning by Richard Grubman of Highfields Capital Management, a money management firm.

Mr. Grubman said that Marlin owed almost $1 billion on debt that was guaranteed by Enron but had no assets other than the Azurix stake. Noting that Enron had paid about $300 million to buy a third of Azurix from public shareholders and had since taken write-downs on its investment in Azurix, Mr. Grubman asked why the company was not setting up reserves to cover its exposure on that debt, which under a complicated arrangement could end up being satisfied through the issuance of Enron shares.

Mr. Lay said that no action was needed but declined to address details. Eventually he cut off Mr. Grubman. "I know you're trying to drive the stock price down, and you've done a pretty good job of it," Mr. Lay said. "But let's move on to the next question."

Mr. Fastow said the company was having no problem issuing commercial paper and had $1.85 billion in such debt outstanding. He said it was backed by $3.35 billion in bank lines of credit, of which $1.75 billion will expire next May if it is not renewed. 

Mr. Lay said he was sorry about "the misunderstanding" that resulted when his brief mention of the $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity in a conference call last week was not noticed by some analysts. That reduction would have been apparent if the company had released its balance sheet with the earnings report, but it did not. He said the company would consider releasing balance sheets with earnings reports in the future, but made no promises.

The large reduction in shareholder equity did not affect reported earnings, and so was not in the earnings release. But it raised concerns that some of the sophisticated financing techniques used by the company might be effectively keeping losses off the earnings statement. The S.E.C. is expected to look into whether the accounting for that transaction was correct.

After one questioner on the call said it would be easier to understand Enron if it released financial statements for the special purpose vehicles that were set up to enter into such transactions as Marlin, Mr. Lay said the company "will look into providing" such statements.

Subject:	Trailing Expenses

Sunita (my former assistant in Dubai)has recently submitted an expense
report for your approval.  She will be submitting another one next month
when additional Amex bills are processed (Amex is slower in Dubai than in
the US).  I thought you might appreciate an explanation for the major items.

1.  Most of the big items relate to a trip in October for my wife and I to
come to Dubai to pack up our stuff (as envisioned and agreed in my
separation arrangements.)  Part of the airline charges were on this month's
Amex;  the rest (along with related hotel & travel expenses) will be on next
month's.

2.  There are some trailing charges for August expenses while I was still
employed (for example, a rental car for my last 2 weeks in Houston closing
out office affairs, some lunches/dinners for former employees who had worked
for me, phone/fax related to close-out etc

3.  Finally, there will be several lunches/dinners related to my current
visit to Dubai.  When I arrived in Dubai last week, Darrin Donegan told me
that a former Enron employee that has chosen to stay in the region is
apparently bitter and is creating some potential problems for Enron.  I told
him that I would be happy to visit with some of my former key contacts to
help set the record straight and ensure that Enron continues to be viewed in
the best light possible.

Hope all is well with you--I'm looking forward to tomorrow's earnings
report.

All the best,

Rick

Dear Jeff,

How are you doing? I hope everything is all right with you. I just came back from Wharton undergrad interview, it was good, we have very strong candidates, and hopefully we can have them as many as possible. It is a pity that you were not there. 

Will you have time to chat a couple of minutes? I need to figure out my career path at Enron and I really need your help. And I will really appreciate it!

Looking forward to speaking to you!

Just a reminder that the weekly EGM Management Committee luncheon meeting will take place on Monday, November 26th, from 12:00 to 1:00 p.m. in conference room ECS 03750.  Lunch will be provided and the meeting should last an hour.  Every week the meeting should begin promptly at 12:00 p.m. although Mike and Jeff may occasionally be a little late because this meeting will be immediately following the Corp. Management Committee meeting that they attend every Monday.  This meeting will occur every week at the same time and location unless notified otherwise.

Please let me know if you will not be able to attend.  Thank you.

Just confirmed with Nowlan's admin that you are the approver in XMS -( the expense report system) - for both Nowlan and Schroeder.

Delores will also make you copies of the past two months' reports for both.

Jeff:

Margaret Skidmore has already floated the idea by shell and will make a
pitch on the 29th.  we will have to see what comes of it.  Everyone loves
the desk - it is just trying to come up with the money.  I will keep trying
to reach the Zilkhas before I leave in the morning or if not then I will
talk with them when I get back.  Keep thinking good thoughts!

Happy Thanksgiving,

cindi

ps - I am having the Bel Geddes cocktail service sent down on approval for
our december meeting.

The Department of Trade and Industry in the UK comes out every quarter with their "Energy Trends" Fuel oil assessment for a quarter in arrears. They published this week their Q2 01 figure (and revised up their Q1 01) figure - the net effect is a ?423,000 hit to the book ($602,000).
 
I would expect that they revise down these figures in their next publication (due mid Jan 2002). We are adjusting the Energy Trends curve for the "actual" fixings tonight (since it effects a lot of other books in Enron Europe) - and will therefore take a hit of $600k tomorrow.

Enron Warns of Problems Eroding Profit
By Rebecca Smith
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

The Wall Street Journal
B16

Enron Corp. warned that continuing credit worries, a decline in the value of some of its assets and reduced trading activity could hurt its fourth-quarter earnings. 
The energy company said it may be forced to take a $700 million pretax hit to earnings due to a plunge in the value of assets held by one of its investment partnerships. The partnership, Whitewing LLP, held assets with a book value of $4.7 billion on Nov. 16 but a drop in the value of Enron stock held by the partnership could result in a derivative loss of $700 million, the company said.
In addition, Enron, Houston, said it may have to come up with more money to honor a collateral call on a $690 million note. That note became a "demand obligation," on Nov. 12, when Enron's credit rating got lowered to triple-B-minus by Standard & Poor's. The company didn't disclose who holds the note. 
"We've got nine days to either repay the note or post a letter of credit or they can start liquidating assets," said company spokesman Mark Palmer. One of the assets includes C.E.G. Rio, a gas distribution company in Brazil that Enron already is in the process of selling and whose proceeds it had intended to use for other forms of debt reduction. The company said it is trying to negotiate a waiver or extension of the credit provision with lenders to preserve its cash. 
Enron has set up a number of partnerships over the years to hedge investment risks and, in some cases, to keep debt off its balance sheet. In the wake of a Securities and Exchange Commission formal probe into its accounting and disclosure practices launched Oct. 31, the company restated its earnings downward dating back to 1997 and has consolidated some debt back onto its balance sheet. 
The company on Nov. 9 agreed to merge with competitor Dynegy Inc. But its latest SEC filing said it was sued by shareholders on Nov. 12 in state court in Houston to prevent the merger from happening. The petition alleges that Enron's directors breached their fiduciary duties to Enron's shareholders by agreeing to sell Enron for inadequate consideration and without an adequate investigation of the alternatives available to Enron. Enron said it would vigorously defend itself. 
Yesterday's filing included numerous changes in previously reported numbers for revenues and expenses. In its original third-quarter statement, the company reported a loss of $618 million. The stated loss was increased to $635 million last week and in the latest filing, the loss for the quarter ended Sept. 30 was widened to $664 million. 
Enron added that the numbers contained in latest filing aren't necessarily final because its external auditor, Arthur Andersen, hasn't completed its review, nor has an internal audit committee finished reviewing the firm's accounting practices.

By ANDREW BALLS, ANDREW HILL and GARY SILVERMAN.

Senior Wall Street bankers are concerned that Dynegy could walk away from its proposed $9.8bn ( #6.8bn) rescue bid for its rival energy group Enron - a move that would have severe repercussions for the energy trading sector and financial markets. 
In a series of interviews with the Financial Times, bankers expressed worries that while credit rating agencies had been assured that it was extremely difficult for Dynegy to pull out, some of the company's shareholders were under the impression that the "material adverse change" clause could be triggered.
"There is no way you can say that this deal is definitely going to happen, or even likely to happen," one banker said. "And the knock on effects of it not going ahead are not good," he added. None of the bankers would agree to be publicly identified. 
The possibility of Dynegy dropping out of the deal was discussed when senior bankers from JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup, which are advising Enron, met with officials from Moody's, the credit rating agencies, 10 days ago. 
The rating agency expressed concerns that it would be too easy for Dynegy to give up its bid, further undermining Enron's creditworthiness. 
Moody's decision to preserve Enron's investment grade rating was one of the main reasons why Dynegy was able to go ahead with its rescue bid. 
In justifying the all-stock bid, Chuck Watson, chairman of Dynegy, said last week that buying the company for a low price - a fraction of Enron's market capitalisation at its peak in 2000 - was a major protection against failure. 
But he admitted that much of the last round of negotiations with Moody's had been spent reassuring them that the material adverse change clauses in the merger agreement were not too loose. 
According to Dynegy, the material adverse change clauses relate to the outcome of a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into Enron's finances, possible litigation against the energy company, balance sheet strength and earnings forecasts. www.ft.com/enron.

Enron drops earnings for 3rd quarter 
$690 million debt comes due for downgraded firm 
By TOM FOWLER 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 
Enron Corp.'s financial well-being continues to be a moving target as the company made more adjustments to its earnings Monday. 
In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Enron said it reduced third-quarter earnings by 3 cents per share and increased earnings for the first nine months of 2001 by 1 cent to reflect recently discovered accounting errors. 
The company also said that its recent credit rating drop may force it to pay off a $690 million note by Nov. 27 if it doesn't find collateral to guarantee the debt. 
The revelations came in the embattled energy trader's 10-Q document, which companies must file every quarter with details of their earnings and balance sheet. Enron delayed releasing the 10-Q by five days and said the filing made Monday had not been fully audited by its accounting firm, Andersen, because of an ongoing investigation by the company's board of directors and the need for more time. 
"We are continuing to review the transactions in question and are making progress with our investigation," said William K. Powers Jr., chairman of Enron's special investigation committee and dean of the University of Texas School of Law. 
Enron's pending $690 million IOU is related to a limited partnership to buy natural gas assets in Brazil. One of the terms of the partnership requires Enron to repay the debt if its credit rating slips to BBB- on rating agency Standard & Poor's scale, which it did Nov. 12. If Enron doesn't put up collateral equal to the amount of the note or repay it, the other partners in the deal can sell off the partnership's assets. 
Enron officials said in the filing they are working with lenders to come up with an acceptable agreement on the debt. 
If Enron's debt rating continues to drop, which would put it below investment grade, the company would face another $3.9 billion in debt repayments, the company said in the filing, mainly by two other partnerships formed in recent years: $2.4 billion owed by Osprey Trust and $915 million by Marlin Water Trust. 
Enron is under a negative review by most rating agencies, but a cash infusion from Dynegy combined with additional lines of credit from a number of investment banks and a possible $500 million to $1 billion equity investment by other investors is expected to keep the ratings afloat. 
The turmoil around Enron's finances started after Oct. 16, when steep losses in its third-quarter earnings drew renewed attention to a pair of investment partnerships created by the former chief financial officer with the approval of the company's board of directors. 
The LJM partnerships were formed using Enron equity and outside capital as a way to hedge against the risks involved in some of the company's new lines of business and were designed to help the company grow quickly without adding too much debt to its books or diluting the value of the company's stock. 
The CFO's dual roles as a company executive and managing director of the entities prompted an SEC investigation as well as an internal Enron investigation that led the company to cut its earnings over the past 4 1/2 years by nearly $600 million. 
Those problems shook investor and trading partner confidence in Enron, which led to a sharp drop in its stock price and cuts in its credit rating. The company eventually reached a deal with rival Dynegy to be acquired for almost $9 billion in stock plus the assumption of almost $13 billion in debt and $2 billion in preferred stock. 
The fallout from Enron's crumble is spreading to its major service providers, including Andersen. That firm has been named as a defendant in at least one shareholder lawsuit, while on Monday Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., called for an investigation of Andersen in connection with its audits of Enron and Houston-based Waste Management. 
"The best accounting standards in the world are meaningless if the accounting and audit processes are so inept or corrupt that they produce unreliable numbers and untruthful reporting," Dingell wrote in a letter to the Public Oversight Board requesting the investigation. 
Andersen, based in Chicago, has a large Houston office and a strong foothold in the energy industry with clients, including Enron and Dynegy. Critics of Andersen have said the firm should have done more as Enron's auditor to draw investors' attention to the company's unusual finances. 
A lawsuit filed in Oregon alleged Andersen's judgment was swayed by lucrative consulting fees that it received from Enron while it was auditor. 
In June, Andersen was fined $7 million by the SEC to settle charges that it filed false and misleading audit reports of Waste Management, the largest civil penalty against a Big Five accounting firm. Andersen did not admit or deny the charges.

Enron Corp. warned in a regulatory filing that it could be forced to pay a $690-million debt by next week and reduced its already abysmal third-quarter earnings. 
The energy giant said a downgrading of its debt last week triggered a Monday deadline for it to repay or offer collateral against the $690 million owed to a party in one of its partnerships.
If the debt isn't paid, the partner could liquidate the partnership's assets, which include a Brazilian natural gas company that Enron was counting on selling to raise $250 million in cash. 
Enron has already used up its $3-billion credit line, secured roughly $2 billion in loans and is looking for more cash. 
The company reduced its previously reported results for the third quarter by 3 cents a share, according to its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. That would put its loss at 87 cents a share.

A congressman has called for an investigation of Big Five accounting firm Arthur Andersen in connection with its audits of Enron Corp. and Waste Management Inc., according to a letter released Monday. 
Turning up the heat under the conflict-of-interest issue among the world's largest bean-counters, Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.) asked the Public Oversight Board for a "review or special investigation of Arthur Andersen LLP," said the letter.
Dingell also asked the board to look into peer reviews of Arthur Andersen conducted in recent years by other accounting firms, including Deloitte & Touche, and questioned the value of a triennial peer review process in place since 1978. 
Arthur Andersen, based in Chicago, was auditor to Houston energy trading giant Enron, rocked in recent weeks by a Securities and Exchange Commission probe of outside partnership deals involving company officers. Enron's stock price has plunged, several managers have resigned and numerous shareholder lawsuits are pending.

U.S. Official Calls for Probe Of Andersen, 2 Problem Audits
By Judith Burns
Dow Jones Newswires

11/20/2001
The Wall Street Journal Europe

(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
WASHINGTON -- Concerned about the accounting profession's ability to police itself, a senior House of Representatives Democrat has called for a "special investigation" of Arthur Andersen LLP and its audits of Enron Corp. and Waste Management Inc. 
In a letter to U.S. Public Oversight Board Chairman Charles Bowsher released Monday, Rep. John Dingell, a Michigan Democrat, requested a review of Andersen's audits of Enron and Waste Management, two high-profile audit failures.
Enron, of Houston, which recently agreed to be acquired by crosstown rival Dynergy Inc., acknowledged it overstated net income by $586 million (662.5 million euros) and will need to restate financial reports dating back to 1997. 
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Enron's treatment of investments in limited partnerships tied to former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. 
Enron's problems come on the heels of another audit debacle for Andersen. In June, the firm reached a $7 million settlement with the SEC in which it neither admitted nor denied allegations of fraud in its audit of Waste Management. 
Andersen and the waste hauler paid $220 million in 1999 to settle class-action lawsuits alleging massive accounting fraud that inflated Waste Management's reported earnings in the mid-1990s. 
In addition to the SEC's probe of its role in the Enron matter, Andersen is undergoing routine peer review by Deloitte & Touche. Dingell suggested that review may be clouded by the fact that Deloitte & Touche has been hired by outside lawyers representing a special committee of Enron's board of directors. 
Given the potential conflict of interest on the part of Deloitte & Touche, and Andersen's track record, "there appears to be little reason for the public to have faith in Andersen or the peer review process," Mr. Dingell wrote.

[Focus on Retirement, Pay and Getting Ahead] 
Passing Up
Some senior executives are spurning hefty severance packages. 
Last week, Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth Lay decided to forgo a $60.6 million severance payment that would have been triggered by Dynegy Inc.'s planned acquisition of the Houston energy trader. Enron initially said Mr. Lay would keep one-third of the planned payout and take it in shares of the combined company. He later decided against any severance payment after criticism by influential energy traders, who produce most of Enron's profits. 
"In this environment, we're seeing producers putting pressure on managers and managers putting pressure on producers to ensure that their pay is in line with their performance," says Ira Kay, executive-compensation practice leader of pay-and-benefits consultants Watson Wyatt Worldwide in New York. 
Alan Johnson, managing director of New York pay consultants Johnson Associates, says Mr. Lay's initial intention to accept a portion of his severance represents "the continuing trend of executives being clueless." 
(For the 12 months ended Aug. 31, Mr. Lay received about $70 million from exercising Enron stock options, according to disclosure reports tracked by Thomson Financial.) 
Three top executives of US Airways Group Inc., including Chief Executive Rakesh Gangwal and Chairman Stephen Wolf, passed up severance after deciding to stay at the company when a planned merger fell through. The trio stood to gain $45 million for resigning as a result of severance agreements triggered by shareholder approval of its now-defunct merger accord with UAL Corp. At US Airways' Sept. 19 annual meeting, they said they would remain with the company. 
Firm Relationship 
New York law firm Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft last week rolled out an unusual formal mentoring program for first-year associates. 
For two hours a month for at least a year, each associate will meet with a designated mentor -- typically a midlevel associate -- to discuss issues such as career development. If the relationship doesn't click, new pairings will be made. CWT hires about 50 law-school graduates a year. 
Jordan Schwartz, the firm's hiring partner, says the initiative was sparked by a 2000 survey of midlevel associates at 165 U.S. law firms conducted by American Lawyer magazine. The poll, which assesses how associates perceive they are being treated, ranked the firm last. "It wasn't an accurate reflection of the firm," he says. "But it was a wake-up call." 
So, CWT created an "associate task force" that identified key issues and explored ways to improve the quality of work life. The mentoring program was one result. 
Hiring Blitz 
Despite rising joblessness, a few employers are hiring in a big way. 
ZipRealty Inc., an online real-estate broker in Richmond, Calif., recently announced plans to hire 1,000 real-estate agents within the next 18 months. It has about 135 agents, all of whom work from home. 
"We have large consumer demands right now, so we want to make sure we have great realtors," says Scott Kucirek, executive vice president of people and culture. 
Since August, zipRealty has hired nearly 30 agents a month for all its 12 markets, which include Los Angeles, Phoenix, San Diego and Chicago. The company has three full-time recruiters sending e-mails and making calls to market its recruitment effort. Its database contains 200 to 300 prospects. 
The job, which usually pays only commission, offers some perks. The company will pay new agents $1,500 a month for three months to give them time to make connections and sell a home. After that, pay will be entirely commission based. New hires also receive cellphone and car allowances.

In New Filing, Enron Reports Debt Squeeze
By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. and FLOYD NORRIS

11/20/2001
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company
The Enron Corporation told investors yesterday that it faced debt repayments over the next year vastly in excess of its available cash. It said that if any of a number of things went wrong, its ability to continue as a going concern would be called into question. 
In a delayed quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said that it would have to repay $690 million in debt by next Tuesday if it did not come up with collateral for a loan.
Enron has about $1.75 billion in cash and credit lines now available but faces debt repayments and other obligations of $9.15 billion by the end of next year. The report for the third quarter, which was filed five days late, says the company faces immediate demand for $3.9 billion in debts if its credit rating is downgraded any further. 
Enron's independent auditors with the firm of Arthur Andersen have not been able to complete their review of Enron's financial statements for the third quarter. Andersen already faces lawsuits over its audits of Enron's books related to Enron's disclosure this month that it had overstated almost $600 million in profits in the last five years. Enron has said that it will restate statements that Andersen certified and that those statements should no longer be relied upon. 
Yesterday, Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, called for an investigation into Arthur Andersen's handling of the Enron audits. A spokesman for Andersen could not be reached last night. 
Enron, the nation's largest energy trader, has agreed to be acquired by Dynegy Inc., its smaller crosstown rival in Houston, and credit rating agencies have said that a failure of that deal to go through would lead to a further downgrading of Enron, which is now at the lowest investment-grade rating. Any downgrades could lead to a collapse of Enron's core energy trading business, analysts say, as other energy trading companies might stop doing business with Enron entirely. 
The Dynegy deal is expected to close sometime next year, and the disclosures yesterday indicate that Enron may face challenges in meeting its obligations before then, particularly if the closing of the deal is delayed. Enron said it hoped to complete the transaction by the end of next September. 
Enron is in talks to obtain $500 million to $1 billion in additional financing through an equity infusion from major banks and institutions. In addition, executives have said they are hoping to close deals to sell $800 million in assets by the end of the year, and perhaps a few billion dollars of assets next year. Enron is also set to receive a $1 billion infusion from ChevronTexaco, which owns a 27 percent stake in Dynegy, if the deal closes next year. 
Still, even after factoring in cash flow from Enron's core energy-trading operations, Enron could be left well short of what it needs to satisfy the huge obligations due by the end of next year -- meaning that Enron will probably have to work to persuade bankers to restructure debts or extend maturities. 
Carol Coale, an analyst for Prudential Securities in Houston, said the new disclosures indicated that Enron's troubles had run deeper than what investors and analysts believed, even as the stock crashed early this month before the merger with Dynegy was announced. 
''Our initial read was that this might have been like a run on the bank,'' Ms. Coale said. ''But now it sounds like Enron's problems were actually more inherent than perceived.'' 
Enron's deal with Dynegy calls for Enron holders to receive 0.2685 Dynegy share for each Enron share, but in trading since the deal was announced Enron's share price has lagged Dynegy's price, reflecting investor doubts that the deal will be completed at the announced terms. 
In New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, before the Enron filing was released, Enron rose 6 cents, to $9.06, and Dynegy rose $1.13, to $43.60. At those prices, the value of the Dynegy offer is 29.2 percent above Enron's share price, compared with a 20.6 percent difference when the deal was announced. 
Some debts that Enron might have to pay quickly if its bond rating is lowered could be satisfied by selling shares, but such sales would probably reduce the stock price further. And the merger agreement with Dynegy provides that the exchange ratio would be reduced if Enron sold stock at prices below the implied value under the merger -- currently $11.71 an Enron share. 
In after-hours trading yesterday, after the release of the Enron filing, the share price slipped to $9. 
Enron had previously said it was reducing its profits taken in previous years by more than $500 million. Yesterday's filing provided some additional details on Enron's relationships with various related partnerships whose debts Enron could be forced to pay, and it said that additional write-offs could come as early as the current quarter if it concluded that asset values in the partnerships had declined. It said that because Enron's stock value had fallen, one write-down could be $700 million. 
The disclosures show that Enron erected complicated financial structures that in some cases seem to have been meant to allow the company to avoid taking losses on assets and in other cases were aimed at keeping debts off its balance sheet. 
But the collapse of Enron's stock price has both worsened the situation for some of those entities and greatly increased the cost Enron would face if it needed to pay off the debts. 
''It is not possible to predict,'' Enron warned investors, whether its asset sales or debt refinancings would be successful. ''An adverse outcome with respect to any of these matters would likely have a material adverse impact on Enron's ability to continue as a going concern.''

Decision to locate ConocoPhillips in Houston enhances world's energy capital
By PAM EASTON
Associated Press Writer

11/20/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.
HOUSTON (AP) - The decision to base the oil giant created by the combination of Phillips Petroleum Co. and Conoco Inc. in Houston, home of the smaller Conoco, helps cement the city's status as the nation's energy capital. 
"Houston already was the energy capital of the world. This just proves it," said Mark Baxter, director of the Maguire Energy Institute at Southern Methodist University in Dallas.
"All the major players are in Houston and Houston can accommodate the employee growth base," he said. "It is easier to conduct the business in the Houston market because not only are all the major companies there, all the support is in Houston as well." 
The dlrs 15.6 billion deal announced Sunday that would create the nation's third largest oil producer may mean more prestige for Houston, even though the nation's two largest oil companies - Irving-based ExxonMobil and San Francisco-based ChevronTexaco - have their headquarters located elsewhere, each has thousands of employees working in the nation's fourth-largest city. 
It all began with the 1901 Spindletop strike in southeast Texas when oilmen discovered that much of the continental United States' vast oil resources lay beneath Texas soil. 
"Historically oil and gas centers sprang up adjacent to oil and gas discoveries," said David Bole, the vice president of Randall & Dewey, Inc., a Houston-based oil consulting firm. "But certainly with high-speed communications developed over the last 30 years, the decision making has been centralized more in the financial centers. 
"What has set Houston apart from many other emerging oil centers was the caliber of the early wildcatters, their vision and their ability to build mega-companies. In many cases it is their legacy that has built Houston into today's oil capital." 
Shell Oil Co. is based in Houston alongside several other producers and numerous offshore drilling, oil field services, pipeline, oil field firefighting and related companies. 
In recent years, the city also has become home to large energy trading firms such as Dynegy, Inc., Enron Corp., Reliant Inc. and others. Together, they operate dozens of computerized energy trading floors scattered throughout the city. 
"Consolidation is cumulative - a self-fulfilling process of centralizing all the important pieces of the oil industry in one place," Bill Gilmer, an economist in Houston for the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, wrote in a recent publication. "The same principles, of course, are what draw moviemakers to Hollywood, financial service providers to New York and automakers to Detroit." 
And, it seems, energy companies to Houston.

COMPANIES & FINANCE THE AMERICAS - Energy deal savings set to increase.
By ANDREW HILL.

Financial Times
(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved
ChevronTexaco yesterday increased the annual savings it expected to achieve from the merger between the two oil groups to $1.8bn by March 2003. 
David O'Reilly, chief executive, told analysts that the combined company would also meet its original synergy target of $1.2bn within six to nine months of the deal, which was completed last month.
Mr O'Reilly also said it expected oil and gas production to grow at an annual rate of 2.5 to 3 per cent over the next five years, and dismissed worries about the falling oil price. 
"Our business is used to swings and volatility - if you want a stable price environment you don't want to be in this business," he told reporters after addressing analysts in New York. 
Mr O'Reilly said the news of the latest big merger in the industry - the $35bn deal between Conoco and Phillips Petroleum - only made him more confident that the ChevronTexaco deal was right. 
ChevronTexaco now claims to be the third-largest energy company in terms of global oil reserves and the fourth-largest in global oil and natural gas production. He said the synergies translated into gains of about $1 per share after tax. 
ChevronTexaco has an important role in Dynegy's rescue bid for Enron, the rival energy group. ChevronTexaco has a 26 per cent stake in Dynegy and immediately invested $1.5bn in convertible preferred shares of Dynegy to fund its direct equity infusion in Enron. ChevronTexaco is committed to buying a further $1bn of Dynegy common stock once Dynegy completes its takeover. If the deal fails, ChevronTexaco can redeem the convertible preferred shares for $1.5bn in cash or convert to common shares, giving it a 36 per cent stake in equity. 
Mr O'Reilly said yesterday the group was committed to the deal, despite worries about potential hidden liabilities at Enron. 
ChevronTexaco is doing its own review of potential litigation risks at Enron, and Mr O'Reilly said there was "a full suite of due diligence" that needed to be done on other issues at Enron. 
* Enron's lenders welcomed the energy company's openness yesterday following a meeting in New York. Greg Whalley, Enron's president, led the meeting, which was postponed when Dynegy began talks with Enron two weeks ago. 
"Much of senior management was there and they were doing a good job," said one. Another banker said Enron management had been "pretty upfront" about the problems at the company, although he said most lenders were reluctant to air their concerns in full at the crowded meeting.

Enron restates Q3 to deeper loss; toils to restructure $690M payment
AP

Copyright (c) 2001 The Canadian Press. All rights reserved.
HOUSTON (AP) _ As embattled Enron Corp. examines its books, the energy trader restated its third-quarter results Monday, increasing its loss for the period by three cents a share to 87 cents. 
The company also disclosed it is trying to restructure a $690-million obligation that could come due Nov. 27.
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said the company has the cash on hand to pay the obligation but would like to have it restructured and extended. 
``We are working with the lenders to restructure or extend the term on the obligation,'' he said. 
Palmer said that when Enron's credit rating was reduced it triggered a clause in one of the ``limited partnership agreements that could cause that $690 million obligation to become due beginning next week.'' 
Houston-based Enron, being purchased by rival Dynegy Inc. to escape a spate of problems and shattered Wall Street confidence, also increased nine-month earnings by a penny to 20 cents a share. 
Dynegy is purchasing the company for $7.8 billion in stock. 
In an SEC filing Nov. 8, Enron said financial statements from 1997 through the first half of 2001 ``should not be relied upon'' and that outside businesses run by Enron officials during that period should have been included in the company's earnings reports. 
That would have reduced Enron's profits for those years by $586 million, from $2.89 billion to $2.31 billion. 
In addition, the company revised its debt upward in each year from 1997 to 2000; at the end of 2000, Enron's debt was $10.86 billion, or $628 million more than previously reported. 
By not disclosing the debt earlier, Enron presumably maintained a stronger credit rating and was able to vastly increase the size of its core operations _ trading natural gas and electricity on wholesale markets. 
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, Enron explained that auditor Arthur Andersen LLP hasn't finalized its review of the company's financial statements because of an ongoing investigation by a special committee appointed by Enron's board of directors. 
In the filing, Enron reiterated it is developing a plan to exit $8 billion in non-core businesses that are performing ``below acceptable rates,'' and expects to use the proceeds to repay debt.

Enron restates third-quarter earnings

HOUSTON (AP) - As embattled Enron Corp. examines its books, the energy trader restated its third-quarter earnings, increasing its loss for the period by 3 cents a share to 87 cents.

"We are continuing to review the transactions in question and are making progress with our investigation," said William K. Powers Jr., chairman of the special committee and dean of the University of Texas School of Law. 
The merger is expected to go through by next summer. Dynegy, backed by major investor ChevronTexaco Inc., will also assume dlrs 13 billion of Enron debt. 
Enron agreed to be bought after its stock price plunged about 80 percent in the weeks after it disclosed a third quarter loss followed by an acknowledgment that the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating partnerships run by company officials. 
The partnerships led to a dlrs 1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity and allowed Enron to keep about half a billion dollars in debt off its books. 
Credit services also have diminished Enron's long-term debt to just above junk grade. 
In the filing, Enron also reiterated it is developing a plan to exit dlrs 8 billion in non-core businesses that are performing "below acceptable rates," and should be able to use the proceeds to repay debt. 
Shares of Enron were up 6 cents to dlrs 9.06 in trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange. Enron announced its latest filing after the market close.

USA: Enron sounds debt alarm, reduces reported earnings.
By C. Bryson Hull

11/19/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
HOUSTON, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Humbled energy giant Enron Corp. on Monday warned that it could be forced to pay a $690 million debt by next week and reduced its already-abysmal third-quarter earnings. 
The Houston company sounded the debt and credit alarms once again in a filing made on Monday with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Among the new information included is the disclosure that Enron is up against a short deadline to meet a $690 million debt obligation triggered by a credit downgrade last week. That marked the start of a nine-day period that expires on Nov. 26, during which Enron must lay down collateral against the debt owed to a third party in one of its myriad partnerships. 
If not, the partner has the right to liquidate all of the assets of the partnership, which includes a Brazilian natural gas company that Enron was counting on selling to raise $250 million in cash. 
The company is working to make alternative payment arrangements, since it can ill-afford to pay the debt now. Enron has already already maxed out its $3 billion credit line, secured roughly $2 billion in loans and is looking for more cash to stay afloat. 
Enron also reduced previously reported 2001 third-quarter earnings by 3 cents per share and increased previously reported earnings for the first 9 months of the year by a penny per share. The move reflects adjustments made after the quarter's end, Enron said. 
On Oct. 16, Enron reported a loss of $638 million or 84 cents per share for the third quarter of 2001. On Nov 8, Enron said it had restated earnings for 1997-2000 and that net income for the four-year period was more than a half a billion lower than originally reported. 
It also warned that a further drop in its credit rating could force it to pay $3.9 billion to other partnerships, the bulk of it to Osprey Trust and Marlin Water Trust. 
Such an outcome would keep Enron from paying its revolving credit accounts and "would likely have a material adverse impact on Enron's ability to continue as a going concern," the company wrote. 
Enron had released those figures earlier, but had yet to state in such stark terms the dire risk the debts pose to its viability. 
CREDIT COULD BE A KILLER 
Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's this month cut their respective senior unsecured debt ratings for Enron to "Baa3" and "BBB-minus," just one notch above "junk" status. Each warned it may cut its respective ratings again. Moody's also cut Enron's short-term debt rating, which affects commercial paper, to "Not Prime," a junk rating. 
In nearly all of its partnership deals, Enron guaranteed the financing it received with a promise to issue Enron shares to its partners if its credit fell below investment grade and its stock price was under certain levels. At the close of trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, Enron shares were at $9.06 - well below the trigger prices. 
All of the partnerships, which Enron used to finance projects in a way that kept them off the balance sheet, have become the once-proud company's bane. The SEC is investigating potential conflict-of-interest issues involving two such partnerships on which ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow served as general partner. 
Enron had to extract itself from those partnerships, which led to a $1.2 billion reduction in Enron shareholder equity. 
The revelation of the equity reduction started one of the more stunning and rapid corporate collapses in recent memory, leaving Enron to be bought on Nov. 9 by smaller cross-town rival Dynegy Inc. for the fire-sale price of $9 billion in stock. 
In an unusual note, Enron said that its financial statements in the filing were not audited by an independent accountant, per SEC regulations, because of "the need of Arthur Andersen LLP, Enron's independent auditors, to complete their review procedures." 
Arthur Andersen had no comment, but Enron said the ongoing investigation by a special committee appointed by Enron's board of directors to look into its partnership dealings precludes the audit's completion.

Enron Warns That Raft of Problems May Hurt Its Fourth-Quarter Profit

11/19/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
Enron Corp. warned that continuing credit worries, a decline in the value of some of its assets and reduced trading activity could hurt its fourth-quarter earnings, Tuesday's Wall Street Journal reported. 
The energy company said it may be forced to take a $700 million pretax hit to earnings due to a plunge in the value of assets held by one of its investment partnerships. The partnership, Whitewing LLP, held assets with a book value of $4.7 billion on Nov. 16 but a drop in the value of Enron (ENE) stock held by the partnership could result in a derivative loss of $700 million, the company said.
In addition, Enron, Houston, said it may have to come up with more money to honor a collateral call on a $690 million note. That note became a "demand obligation," on Nov. 12, when Enron's credit rating got lowered to triple-B-minus by Standard & Poor's. The company didn't disclose who holds the note. 
"We've got nine days to either repay the note or post a letter of credit or they can start liquidating assets," said company spokesman Mark Palmer. One of the assets includes C.E.G. Rio, a gas distribution company in Brazil that Enron already is in the process of selling and whose proceeds it had intended to use for other forms of debt reduction. The company said it is trying to negotiate a waiver or extension of the credit provision with lenders to preserve its cash. 
Enron has set up a number of partnerships over the years to hedge investment risks and, in some cases, to keep debt off its balance sheet. In the wake of a Securities and Exchange Commission formal probe into its accounting and disclosure practices launched Oct. 31, the company restated its earnings downward dating back to 1997 and has consolidated some debt back onto its balance sheet. 
The company on Nov. 9 agreed to merge with competitor Dynegy Inc. (DYN). But its latest SEC filing said it was sued by shareholders on Nov. 12 in state court in Houston to prevent the merger from happening. The petition alleges that Enron's directors breached their fiduciary duties to Enron's shareholders by agreeing to sell Enron for inadequate consideration and without an adequate investigation of the alternatives available to Enron. Enron said it would vigorously defend itself. 
Monday's filing included numerous changes in previously reported numbers for revenues and expenses. In its original third-quarter statement, the company reported a loss of $618 million. The stated loss was increased to $635 million last week and in the latest filing, the loss for the quarter ended Sept. 30 was widened to $664 million. 
Enron added that the numbers contained in latest filing aren't necessarily final because its external auditor, Arthur Andersen, hasn't completed its review, nor has an internal audit committee finished reviewing the firm's accounting practices.

Enron Files 10-Q For 3Q With SEC

11/19/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) filed its Form 10-Q for the third quarter and said its previously reported third quarter loss of 84 cents a share was widened by 3 cents to reflect adjustments made subsequent to the end of the quarter. 
As reported, Enron was restating financial statements from 1997 through the second quarter of 2001 due to questions over its finances.
On Oct. 16, Enron reported a loss of $618 million on revenue of $47.6 billion for the third quarter ended Sept. 30. 
In a press release Monday, the company said its earnings of 19 cents a share for the nine-month period of 2001 were increased by 1 cent a share. 

Enron said its independent auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, hasn't finalized its review of the company's financial statements in accordance with established professional standards because of the ongoing investigation by the special committee of the board and the need for Andersen to complete its review procedures. 
In the third quarter, Enron wrote off more than $1 billion related to its failed investments and reduced shareholder equity by about $1.2 billion to unwind an off-balance financing vehicle once run by its former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. That relationship is being examined in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation, and is the center of more than a dozen shareholder lawsuits. 
According to the company's Form 10-Q, the special committee's investigation may identify additional or different information concerning these matters, which would require additional or different restatements. 

Dow Jones Corporate Filings Alert reported Monday that Enron is currently preparing a restructuring plan aimed at taking aggressive steps to rationalize the company's existing cost structure, accelerating the process of divesting non-core businesses and assets and restructuring scheduled maturities of debt and other obligations. 
Enron said it is unable to estimate the timing of restructuring or the financial impact, but said fourth quarter results of operations will likely be hurt by employee severance, restructuring and other charges, according to Corporate Filings Alert. 
The company had $1 billion in cash and cash equivalents at Sept. 30. 
On Nov. 9, Enron and Dynegy Inc. (DYN) signed a definitive merger agreement that would give Enron shareholders 0.2685 share of a Dynegy share. The merger is expected to close by the end of the third quarter of 2002.

Fears Mount Over Enron/Dynasty Deal

KATHLEEN HAYS, CNNFN ANCHOR, MARKETS IMPACT: There are mounting fears about the fate of the Enron (URL: http://.www.enron.com/) /Dynegy (URL: http://www.dynegy.com/) deal. Financial Times once again has a scoop. Robert Thomson is the U.S. Managing Editor of the FT joining us now with details. Robert what`s going on I thought this was suppose to be a done deal? 
ROBERT THOMSON, FINANCIAL TIMES, U.S. MANAGING EDITOR: Well that`s right Kathleen but the interesting thing that make it perhaps not so done a deal is what we might call the materially adverse clause. That there is a change in the conditions surrounding Enron that makes (INAUDIBLE) a downgrade of them possible and really leaves the financial institutions exposed to them. And these financial institutions in conversations interviews with the Financial Times are telling us that they have deeper fears about this materially adverse clause being enacted than people out there now realize.
HAYS: Well I must say I think this is very interesting and I`m surprised not that I`m an expert on the deal or even close to the deal itself but it seemed that part of the way that Enron was getting the deal done with Dynegy was to say look we dug up all the possible problems all the maybe kind of hidden not so great deals that are being investigated now and supposedly everything was on the table. So what, what do you think? What are you hearing that they`re finding now that makes things look worst than they already look? 
THOMSON: Well really that`s the issue. To be quite honest we don`t know but who would have known a month ago and particularly three months ago that Enron is in this situation that it`s now in and how far those problems stretch is really the issue that (INAUDIBLE) surrounding Enron still have it and that they suspect that Dynegy might have it. It looks quite more (INAUDIBLE) the deal. Now Dynegy is saying but we`re going ahead with this yes there is that clause there, yes it covers us in case we find something that we don`t like the look of or like the smell of depending on what it maybe but we don`t` feel it will have to activate it. But of course on the other hand they are going to say that but they do have that fall back clause if they need it. 
HAYS: Go ahead Robert I`m sorry. 
THOMSON: So, but the truth is you know the full extent of Enron`s exposure to various businesses really is hidden by the complexity of the transaction`s the company was engaging in markets where frankly very few people know a lot about it. 
HAYS: What happens if the deal falls through? What happen to Enron? 
THOMSON: Well there`s a real issue there that a downgrade may follow and this there`s certainly concern in the banking community. Again, that the level of exposure in counter party risk and so on to Enron isn`t fully comprehended and frankly that`s why they spoke to the Financial Times because they thought well there`s an impression that this is a done deal, that the Enron problem is solved. They`re saying actually not so. 
HAYS: Wow. Well I think we have just enough time to take a look at you`re you got us something in China again. You take us to that world part of the world frequently what`s going on there. 
THOMSON: Yeah we Beijing (INAUDIBLE) here. Essentially the IFC the International Finance Corporation arm of the World Bank is taking a large stake in Chinese Bank in Nanjing (ph). That is amazing really. It`s by far the largest stake, $27 million, 15 percent in the Nanjing(ph) City Bank and it`s really we here are going to be the first of three big investments in Chinese banks over the next year or so. There are two small ones there already where people have taken 3, 5 percent in Chinese banks but for the first time International institutions are in a position where they can think about Chinese retail banking in a serious way. 
HAYS: OK Robert well thank you very much I guess that`s something for investors to watch. Particularly people who are global investors.

Enron Reduces Earnings, Warns $690 Mln Payment Due (Update2)

Enron Reduces Earnings, Warns $690 Mln Payment Due (Update2)

     (Adds in first paragraph that note payment may come next
week.)

     Houston, Nov. 19 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., which agreed to
a takeover by Dynegy Inc. after a financial crisis threatened it
with bankruptcy, revised third-quarter earnings for the second
time this month and said it may have to make early payment of a
$690 million note next week.

     The Houston-based company lowered results by 3 cents a share,
bringing its third-quarter loss to 87 cents, or $664 million,
according to a Securities & Exchange Commission filing.
Liabilities from an affiliated partnership may reduce fourth-
quarter earnings by $700 million before taxes, Enron said.

     The disclosures don't indicate that Enron is in much worse
shape than on Nov. 8, said John Olson, an energy analyst at
Sanders Morris Harris. That's when Enron lowered its earnings back
to 1997 by $586 million, reflecting losses by affiliated
partnerships that it had wrongly kept off the books.

     ``I don't think anyone would be particularly surprised that
they had to adjust third-quarter earnings (again) considering they
restated earnings for the last four years,'' said Olson, who
doesn't own shares of Dynegy or Enron. ``I don't think it's a
problem.''

     Making good on debt owed by its Whitewing partnership may cut
Enron's fourth-quarter earnings. Enron is obligated to back
Whitewing by issuing junior convertible preferred stock. Because
Enron's stock has plunged, it may have to write down its assets by
$700 million, the filing said.

                       Partnership Problems

     Enron said that the Dynegy buyout could collapse if Enron is
forced to pay judgments of more than $2 billion to settle lawsuits
over its dealings with affiliated partnerships. Dynegy has said it
can cancel the transaction if Enron's litigation costs and other
liabilities grow to $3.5 billion or more. Enron faces at least 23
such lawsuits.

     Enron used affiliated partnerships to raise money quickly and
take debt off its books. Its shares plunged by 89 percent this
year as investors questioned whether the partnerships also were
being used to hide losses from failed investments.

     Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay said earlier this month
that buying back 62 million shares from two such partnerships cost
Enron shareholders $1.2 billion in lost equity. The company wrote
off $1.01 billion in investments in water, telecommunications and
retail-energy sales in the third quarter.

     A drop in Enron's senior unsecured debt rating to ``BBB-'' by
Standard & Poor's on Nov. 12 may force Enron to pay off the $690
million note by Nov. 27 if it doesn't find collateral to guarantee
the debt taken on by another affiliated partnership, the company
said.

                        Brazilian Liability

     Without repayment or collateral, investors in a partnership
that owns Brazilian natural-gas assets can begin to liquidate the
partnership's assets, Enron said. Enron said it's working with
lenders to come up with an acceptable agreement on the debt.

     ``If we can't talk lenders into refinancing, there is the
possibility that . . . note would be due next week,'' said Karen
Denne, an Enron spokeswoman.

     As of Friday, the company had $1.3 billion in cash on hand.
It expects to close on $450 million in additional financing
tomorrow, and to complete $800 million in asset sales by the end
of the year. It's also trying to find investors who will put $500
million to $1 billion into the company.

     The company has raised cash in recent weeks by using its
pipelines as collateral. It received $1.5 billion from
ChevronTexaco last week as part of the Dynegy buyout agreement. In
return, Dynegy acquired preferred stock and other rights in an
Enron unit that owns the Northern Natural Gas pipeline. Dynegy can
acquire the pipeline even if the merger falls through.

     Enron closed on a $550 million loan from J.P. Morgan Chase &
Co. and Salomon Smith Barney Inc. on Wednesday that was secured
with assets of Enron's Transwestern Pipeline Co. It expects to
close on another $450 million loan, secured with other Northern
Natural Gas assets, this week, Denne said. The commitment for the
loans was announced Nov. 1.


                      $3.9 Billion Liability

     The company also has huge liabilities that could push it into
financial crisis before the merger closes. A further drop in its
debt rating, which would put it below investment grade, would
trigger repayment of $3.9 billion in debt owed by two other
affiliated companies, Enron said.

     The rating drop would force it to repay $2.4 billion in debt
owed by Osprey Trust, and $915 million in debt taken on by Marlin
Water Trust, the company said in the filing.

     Arthur Andersen LLP, Enron's auditor, didn't grant final
approval of its financial statements in the filing because of an
internal investigation of its dealings with affiliated
partnerships, Enron said. The SEC is also investigating the
partnerships, which were run by Enron executives.

     The filing was released after the stock market closed. Shares
of Enron rose 6 cents to $9.06. Dynegy rose $1.13 to $43.60.
ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns 26 percent of Dynegy and is
providing $2.5 billion in cash as part of the Enron buyout, fell
54 cents to $82.91.


ChevronTexaco Sees Investor Suits as Threat to Enron (Update1)
2001-11-19 19:53 (New York)

ChevronTexaco Sees Investor Suits as Threat to Enron (Update1)

     (Updates with Enron reducing third-quarter results in last
paragraph.)

     New York, Nov. 19 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s exposure to
investor lawsuits is the biggest hurdle in its proposed buyout by
Dynegy Inc., said David O'Reilly, chief executive officer of
ChevronTexaco Inc., which is helping to back Dynegy's purchase.

     ChevronTexaco is ``paying particular attention to the
litigation risk,'' though ``we still think it's a good deal for
Dynegy and an even better deal for ChevronTexaco,'' Reilly said at
an analyst meeting in New York.

     ChevronTexaco, the second-biggest U.S. oil company, owns 27
percent of Dynegy. It agreed to provide Dynegy $2.5 billion as
part of the Enron purchase. Dynegy can cancel the bid if Enron's
legal liabilities, including investor suits, exceed $3.5 billion.
Enron said today in a regulatory filing it can't calculate the
cost of shareholder suits.

     Dynegy agreed 10 days ago to buy rival Enron, the largest
energy trader, for stock and debt now valued at $20.7 billion.
Enron's stock had plunged in recent weeks because of concerns it
was using affiliated partnerships to mask losses and hide debt.

     Gold Bennett Cera & Sidner LLP filed a class action suit in
Houston today alleging Enron misrepresented its business and
results. Other investors have filed similar suits.

     ChevronTexaco will have a clearer picture of the legal risks
in the next few months, O'Reilly said. ``There is no transaction
that is risk free,'' he said.

     Shares of Enron rose 6 cents to $9.06 today. They have
tumbled 89 percent this year. Dynegy gained $1.13 to $43.60. The
stock has declined 22 percent this year. Both companies are based
in Houston.

     ChenvronTexaco, based in San Francisco, fell 54 cents to
$82.91.

     Earlier this month, Enron reduced its earnings in the past
four years by $552 million because of accounting errors involving
affiliates. Enron ousted its chief financial officer, and it fired
its treasurer and a company attorney for making improper
investments in one of the affiliates.

     Enron reduced third-quarter earnings for a second time and
said it may have to make early payment on a $690 million note
this month, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission.




Enron Says It May Have to Pay Off $690 Mln Note Next Week
2001-11-19 18:16 (New York)

Enron Says It May Have to Pay Off $690 Mln Note Next Week

     Houston, Nov. 19 (Bloomberg) -- Enron said a drop in its
credit rating may force it to pay off a $690 million note by Nov.
27 if it doesn't find collateral to guarantee the debt.

     Repayment was triggered by the Nov. 12 downgrade in Enron's
senior unsecured debt rating to BBB- by Standard & Poor's, the
company said in a securities filing.

     Enron must post collateral equal to the amount of the note or
repay it, the Securities and Exchange Commission filing said.

    Without repayment, partners in a Limited Partnership that owns
natural gas assets in Brazil can immediately begin to liquidate
the partnership's assets, Enron said. Enron said it's working with
lenders to come up with an acceptable agreement on the debt.

     A further drop in its debt rating, which would put it below
investment grade, would trigger repayment of $3.9 billion in debt
owed by two affiliated companies.

     The rating drop would trigger repayment of $2.4 billion in
debt owed by Osprey Trust, and $915 million owed by Marlin Water
Trust, the company said in the filing.

     Enron is being bought by Dynegy Inc. for $25 billion in stock
and debt. Enron also said in its filing that if shareholder
lawsuits result in judgments totaling more than $2 billion, the
Dynegy deal could collapse.

    The filing was released after the stock market closed.  Shares
of Houston-based Enron rose 6 cents to $9.06. Dynegy shares rose
$1.13 to $43.60. Shares of ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns 26
percent of Dynegy, fell 54 cents to $82.91.



Enron's Azurix May Have to Sell Assets If It Can't Borrow
2001-11-19 14:35 (New York)

Enron's Azurix May Have to Sell Assets If It Can't Borrow

     Houston, Nov. 19 (Bloomberg) -- Azurix Corp., Enron Corp.'s
water unit, may have to sell assets if it can't find financing to
continue operations, the company said in a regulatory filing.

     Enron took Azurix public in June 1999 and then, after the
water company's stock plunged, took it private and paid off
investors in March.

     Azurix isn't sure it will be able to renew or refinance about
$113.3 million in long-term debt, including bank loans, that
matures before Sept. 30 at a ``reasonable'' cost, it said in a
filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The
company also had $326.3 million in short-term debt as of Sept. 30.

     The loans are Azurix's ``primary sources of liquidity,'' the
filing said. If the company can't raise the funds, it might have
to use the proceeds from planned asset sales to refinance debt and
get cash, the filing said.

     If those asset sales don't generate enough money, ``Azurix
may need to sell other assets, which could result in Azurix
incurring losses in future periods,'' the company said.

     Azurix, though it still must file with the SEC, no longer
trades as a separate stock. The shares of Houston-based Enron fell
8 cents to $8.92 in early afternoon trading.

     Enron agreed earlier this month to be acquired by rival
Dynegy Inc. in a transaction currently valued at $24.9 billion.
The buyout came after Enron's shares plunged amid an SEC
investigation of the company's dealings with affiliated
partnerships.



U.S.'s Dingell Seeks Probe of Arthur Andersen, Dow Jones Says
2001-11-19 15:24 (New York)


     Washington, Nov. 19 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. Representative John
Dingell, a Michigan Democrat, has requested a special
investigation of Arthur Andersen LLP's audits of Enron Corp. and
Waste Management Inc., Dow Jones Newswires reported.

     Dingell sent a letter to Public Oversight Board Chairman
Charles Bowsher asking for the review, the newswire said.

      Andersen, the world's fifth largest accounting firm, served
as Enron's outside auditor for more than a decade, assuring
investors the company's financial statements conformed with
generally accepted accounting principles. Earlier this month, the
company reported that it overstated earnings by $586 million over
four-and-a-half years, inflated shareholder equity by $1.2 billion
because of an ``accounting error,'' and failed to consolidate
results of three affiliated partnerships into its balance sheet.

     In June, Andersen reached a $7 million settlement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission in which it neither admitted
nor denied allegations of fraud related to its audit of Waste
Management, Inc. Andersen is now undergoing a peer review by
Deloitte & Touche, Dow Jones said.


ENRON RESTATES Q3 RESULTS
>From CBS.MarketWatch.com

By Leticia Williams

8:35 PM ET Nov 19, 2001

WASHINGTON (CBS.MW) - Embattled Enron Corp. restated its third-quarter
earnings Monday,  increasing its loss for the period by 3 cents a share
to 87 cents, according to an SEC filing.

Houston-based Enron (ENE), which is being purchased by rival Dynegy to
escape a recent spate of problems and shattered Wall Street  confidence,
also increased nine-month earnings by a penny to 20  cents a share.

Dynegy (DYN) is purchasing the company for $7.8 billion in stock.

Enron must also pay off or refinance $690 million in debt obligations
by Nov. 26 or risk triggering nearly $4 billion in additional payments,
according to the SEC filing.

If the company doesn't make the payment on that date, the investors
have the right to immediately begin to liquidate the assets of a certain
limited partnership for an amount equal to the note payable.

In addition, Enron may sell the limited partnership's assets for
amounts below their carrying values.

"The net proceeds from the sale of such assets can be used to repay
Enron's obligation, " according to the company's 10Q filed Monday with
the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Enron is in talks with lenders to "develop a mutually acceptable"
amendment or waiver to avoid having to issue payment on the $690 million
note.

If the company fails to make the payment or if its credit rating falls
below investment grade, it will be forced to pay off or refinance up to
an additional $3.9 billion, the company said.

Standard &amp; Poor's currently has the company rated at BBB-, a notch
above speculative grade. Fitch rates the company's credit at BBB-,
evolving. Moody's Investor services rates the company Baa3, under
review. All ratings apply to the senior unsecured debt of the
corporation.

A note trigger would force the company to repay, refinance or cash
collaterize certain facilities in the amount of $3.9 billion, which
primarily consists of $2.4 billion in Osprey Trust and $915 million in
Marlin Water Trust, Enron said in the filing.

The company's (ENE) shares gained 6 cents to close at $9.06.

Company officials didn't immediately reply to questions about where it
would raise the money, since it's effectively barred from the capital
markets.

This is just an early warning incase you get calls from business unit managers complaining about insurance premiums going up in the budget process. The intial estimates had been agreed last month and now we have to reopen the process to account for the WTC attack impact on the insurance markets. If you have any questions or if internal issues come to your attention, please contact me or Jim Bouillion. Per

Subject:	2002 Insurance Budget - RC 100226
Importance:	High

Last week's catastrophic event in New York and Washington D.C. has produced losses precipitating a further "hardening" of the worldwide insurance market resulting in higher rates, larger deductibles and retentions and more restrictive terms and conditions. The greatest impact has been to the property insurers with loss estimates in the billions. Liability insurers have seen a lesser impact in projected losses but rates are also expected to rise.

Our initial budget assumptions could not foresee this event. After consultation with our insurance market resources, we have deemed it necessary to increase our premium projections by an additional $9million for Property and $3million for Excess Liability. Enron's Worker's Compensation, Auto Liability, and General Liability are insulated from market fluctuations due to the use of our captive to fund these exposures.

Our budget only contemplates actual premiums. In the event the property deductible increases beyond the capabilities of the business units, we may be required to arrange a funding or other mechanism to manage the deductible. We are prepared to discuss this with you on an individual basis.

You will be receiving a revised budget from Corporate Financial Planning incorporating these increases. 

Please review and give me a call at x37904 should you wish to discuss further.

Regards,

Hi Mark,

We had our call with Dow today.  Needless to say Carlo Gaurino was very dissapointed in our moving forward.  Privately he mentioned to Nowlan that they are about to announce layoffs, and another crappy quarter.  

We will be putting a banner headline on EOL announcing these products in the next week.

Regards,

Jeff

Jeff,
 
I'll be back shortly to you and Mike.  Pls see my other note.  Assuming we get to MOU at end of month (which is still according to plan) then would look at making significant local press release.  This would be an opportune time to have you or Mike in town.  We could also arrange for other commercial meetings as well.

 Robert,
 
We have been the target of a number of web based articles on a site hosted by E-Rex, an electricity market broker.  E-Rex is owned by Mitsui and a couple of banks.  The website is located at www.erex.co.jp <http://www.erex.co.jp> with links to energy news.net.  The articles are in Japanese and we have translated these below.  We are not the only target, but certainly one of the main company targets.  We have not spoken with ERex or any of its owners.  It is generally believed that there are a number of different writers (Mr. Z), but maintain their anonymity.
 
It seems to us as though there are clearly some inside sources that are being used.  Could be EPower (or Enron Japan)?
 
Any thoughts?

News Behind the Scenes (14): September 28

 


E Power Practically Dissolved: What was the Cause of Its Downfall?


Mr.Z - A man behind the scenes

 E Power, a power generation company, which is jointly funded by Enron, a U.S. energy giant, and Orix, was dissolved for all intents and purposes on the 17th of this month.  On this day, 40 people, including Mr. Carey Sloan (chairman) and Mr. Tatsuro Seguchi (president) left E Power, and Mr. J O'Day (sic), who used to be the vice president of Enron Japan, assumed the office of president and CEO of E Power.  At the same time, E Power's office was moved from a building in Shinjyuku, Tokyo to within Enron Japan's office located in the First Square Building in Otemachi, Tokyo.  Rumors are starting to spread amongst people in the industry that the two companies will merge together in the near future.

 According to a source in a trading company, the recent mass departure from E Power took place, because Enron Corp, which was irritated by E Power's poor business results, fired everyone who were related to the company's generation department.  Moreover, all of the company's power plant siting projects, except for a project in Ube, Yamaguchi Prefecture, will apparently be brought back to square one.  It is looking likely that the company's large-scale gas-fired power plant project in Rokkashomura, Aomori Prefecture, which drew the attention of the energy industry, will be killed off even before a piece of land was obtained for the project.

 The greatest cause of the company's downfall was that it was unable to show any clear business strategy.  At the time of foundation, the company was intending to conduct mainly trading and intermediation of electricity.  However, the company changed its objective to siting its own power plants because it realized that securing of surplus electricity was difficult.  Furthermore, because acquisition of land had not been going well for the company, the company, until recently, had been considering energy-saving service (ESCO) as a stopgap measure until a power plant could be constructed.

 So far, the company has not been able to conduct any business that produced a cash flow.  In other words, the company has been operating with a loss ever since its establishment.  It is hardly possible for Enron, which is avaricious when it comes to pursuing cost-effectiveness, to leave this situation as it is.  One could say that E Power has done well to have held out this long.

 Another cause -a hidden cause - of E Power's downfall was surely the fact that the company held up high a flag that showed the five-letter word "Enron".  A few years ago, a person related to a certain IPP turned down an offer from E Power to purchase its surplus energy saying that "although he wouldn't mind selling power to E Power, he had not intention of selling any power to Enron".

It may have been a mistake for E Power, which was established mainly around electricity business specialists from trading companies, such as Marubeni, to have joined hands with Enron, which is particularly good at using business methods that would not be accepted in Japan.

                                                                                                                                            News Behind the Scenes  

                                                                                                                                      Another Article (Title not available)

Before I was able to overcome the astonishment that I felt regarding the terrorist attacks in the United States, a major massacre took place on the following Monday on the 17th at EPower, an affiliated company of a major energy trading company in the United States, Enron Corp.  I had thought that a major restructuring would take place soon or later, but the extent of which made me realize just how dry an American company could be.

 It has been almost two years since EPower was established, and for some employees, including executives, the term of contract was about to end.  In that sense, it is not surprising that things happened.  In any case, all EPower employees - numbering close to 50 - were called into the office by e-mail on the 17th, and 35 people were told there and then that they were fired.  Quite amazing.

 EPower's office was moved immediately to where Enron Japan's office is located in the First Square Building in Otemachi, Chiyoda-ku, from Shinjyuku Center Building in Nishi-Shinjyuku, Shinjyuky-ku, Tokyo.   The efficient way in which everything was executed was like a well-planned coup d'etat.  You could say that an Enron cruise missile has made a direct hit on EPower.

 As I described above, EPower was established two years ago under the auspices of Enron Corp as the standard-bearer of electricity liberalization.  At one stage, the company sent shockwaves through the electricity industry being compared to the black ships that came to Japan at the end of Tokugawa shogunate regime.  However, despite the company's promising start, the company seems to be heading towards an anticlimax.  It is of most people's opinion that the company's capital subscriber, Enron Corp, will abandon the company in the end, dissolving the company as soon as the remaining businesses are cleared up.  

 Among the 35 people fired from EPower, I hear that there is someone who joined the company in April this year.  There certainly was a problem with EPower's management increasing the number of staff without making much of a business progress.  However, I question highly the way in which Enron carried out dismissal en masse.  

Enron probably would argue its case by saying that people have no right to complain because the company had observed applicable laws and contracts.  However, laws and contracts are only minimal obligations.  It seems that the company has no recognition of the fact that a higher-level consideration is necessary for people with different cultures to work together.

Not unlike the US Government which does not recognize that one of the major reasons for the recent terrorist attacks on the United States was due to the shortcomings in its Middle East - Islam policy, Enron too does not understand the key elements in doing business in Japan.  

 

News Behind the Scenes: September 12

A Black Ship Named "Enron" Runs Aground in Japanese Waters

Mr.Z - A man behind the scenes

 Enron may pull out of the Japanese market in the near future - this is the opinion that is beginning to spread amongst people related to the energy industry in Japan.  The reason for this is that both "EPower", an electricity retailing company jointly funded by Enron and Orix Corp., and "Enron Japan", a fully-owned energy trading company of Enron, are being forced to fight a desperate battle in the Japanese market.  

 In particular, the way EPower is running about in confusion stands out quite conspicuously.  The company, when founded in 1999, looked to conduct electricity intermediation business, but has been having a hard time trying to launch the business because of significant barriers in the liberalized electricity market.  In spite of the fact that the company has changed its strategy to building its own power plants in various places, such as Omuta in Fukuoka, Ube in Yamaguchi, Rokkashomura in Aomori, etc., the company is still having a difficult time trying to obtain the necessary sites.

 Within such an environment, the company's CEO, Mr. Bruce Wrobel, left EPower in February this year because his plans for the company differed from that of Enron Corp's.  Then in August, Mr. Hiroo Awano, who has been quite active in visible scenes, such as dealing with the media as a deputy representative and the spokesman for the company, was suddenly fired.  It seems that he was made responsible for the company's poor performances.

 There is also information floating around that "EPower has been examining the possibility of conducting energy-saving service business in cooperation with large electrical appliance manufacturers, automobile manufacturers, general construction companies, etc., until its electricity retailing business gets going."  It is unclear whether this is a present progressive development or not.  However, it is possible to catch a glimpse of the company's impatience as it strives to "achieve whatever result possible".

 Meanwhile, there is a rumor that Enron Japan will carry out a major corporate restructuring.  Amalgamation with EPower could also be a possibility.

 The U.S. Government and USTR are making multitude of demands to the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry through U.S.-Japan Deregulation Conference so that they could somehow make Enron's advances into the Japanese market a success.  However, it seems that Enron's solidarity with politics is producing a result opposite to what was intended.  Could a black ship named "Enron," which has run aground in the Japanese waters, go to the bottom after all before too long?

Subject: FW: Invitation to HCCC Event


All,

Attached is an invitation to a Young Friends cocktail reception at the Houston Center for Contemporary Craft on November 29th.  The HCCC is a nonprofit organization with a mission to advance education about the process, product and history of craft.  While we are describing this as a "Young Friends" event, any and all are welcome, you just need to be young at heart!!  Please help us to kick this organization off right!!  

Did I mention the free wine, beer and food from Carrabba's, and the possibility of winning a luxury weekend at the new Hotel Derek????  Hope to see you there!!

Rachael

This week each business unit across Enron has been asked to identify the optimal structure and resources on a going forward basis.  While the review is not complete, we are close to finalizing decisions surrounding each individual business.
We ask for your continued patience and we know that may be asking a lot. 
Please take the opportunity to enjoy the time with your family at Thanksgiving and know that we are working hard on finalizing all details. No significant organizational announcements will take place next week.
Mike and Jeff

Subject:	EnronOnline- Change to Autohedge

Effective Monday, October 22, 2001 the following changes will be made to the Autohedge functionality on EnronOnline.

The volume on the hedge will now respect the minimum volume and volume increment settings on the parent product. See rules below: 

?	If the transaction volume on the child is less than half of the parent's minimum volume no hedge will occur.
?	If the transaction volume on the child is more than half the parent's minimum volume but less than half the volume increment on the parent, the hedge will volume will be the parent's minimum volume.
?	For all other volumes, the same rounding rules will apply based on the volume increment on the parent product.

Please see example below:

Parent's Settings:
Minimum: 	5000
Increment:  1000

Volume on Autohedge transaction			Volume Hedged
1      - 2499							0
2500 - 5499							5000
5500 - 6499							6000

Dear Equity,

Good morning, 

I hope you had a god weekend.  I was finally able to catch up on all the
gimmicks being thrown around to jump-start the economy.  Have you seen the
one that would temporarily suspend sales taxes, a la 0.0% financing on
autos?  What the politico's should really do is get some ideas from the
organizers of the Victoria's Secret (no, there's no relation unfortunately)
TV show or the Britney Spear's HBO show.  Have you seen the ratings on
those!?  That seems to be what is drawing the American consumer these days. 

But despite that being still up in the air, it looks like the economy is in
the process of bottoming anyway.  Stocks have continued to rally, oil is
below $18, commodities have rallied, money is up and so is refi.  If we
could only get the surveys to behave, we'd be very happy.  Interest rates
had been falling up until last week when the backed up.  This was largely
interpreted as the bond market smelling the economic recovery.  If rates
get too high, it could obviously be a problem, but this "hiccup" in rates
is something we have seen before in periods of transition.  Page 3
highlights the "hiccups" in the past when you had the economy shifted from
a recession to a recovery.  

Another big question on everyone's mind is Holiday Sales.  They are widely
expected to be weak, weak, weak.  So where does that leave room for a
surprise? on the upside.  Turn to page 6 for all the positives that could
help Holiday Sales.  I for one am not expecting a lump of coal.  

The political report highlights the effects of the war in Afghanistan on
globalization.  Despite all the initial doom-and-gloom, it looks like it
has actually pushed global cooperation along.  

Jim Moltz thinks the market is just about fairly valued here at about 22
times 2002 earnings.  That being said, he also thinks the liquidity
available out there will drive the market higher when those assets start to
actively look for higher yielding instruments.  Some of that could be into
the long end of the curve if rates stay higher, but some will also be into
the equity markets.  Jim also tweaked his operating earnings estimate for
2001 from $38 to $39.50.  2002 is still at $50.  

Have a great week and a very happy Thanksgiving.  If there is anything I
can do, I will be in so please just let me know.

We can't wait for another meeting - we are in front of the OOC on Monday with the Enron Americas plan.

Here's my numbers (I got them from etrade!!!!!):

0 - 5000 transactions per day		$  8:00/normal transaction (including internals)
> 5,000 transactions			$ 10:00/normal transaction 
Options					$ 10:00/ per option (using option grid)
Take or Pay				Minumum Number of transactions per annum = 1,000,000
Service Interruption (outage)		Reduction in our bill of $100,000		(less than 30 minutes)
					Reduction in our bill of $500,000		(greater then 30 minutes)
Per product type set up 			0		(its in your interest as the number of transactions is high in ENA.  It think this issue is for other groups.)
On development 			0		(its in your interest - I think this again an issue for other groups.)

Now we all have the same incentive - grow the number of trades. I think this is pretty close for us.  Only paying once for a sleeve trade.

Let the games begin!

Louise

Subject:	EnronOnline Budgeting Method

As you each have heard over the past few days, EnronOnline is currently looking at a new methodology for charging the business units for services in 2002.  We intend to move away from an allocation mindset into one where services (in the form of products, transactions, and development) are charged on a usage basis, allowing the business units to scale and develop their markets in a more cost responsive way.  My assistant will be contacting your offices to schedule 30 minutes with each of you on Friday, Oct 19th to go over the proposed plan and discuss its impact on next year's budget.  I am confident that this process will yield a method that accurately reflects the cost of EnronOnline and allows each of you to make sound financial decisions about your plans to use EnronOnline in 2002.

Please don't hesitate to call me before Friday with questions, and I look forward to meeting with you.

Brad Richter

Citibank just turned us down on a q3 jet swap saying Enron was at their internal credit limit.

I have had many complaints over the last year about the inability for the interest rate group to set their curves on time and on a consistant basis.  Every few months I once again ask Puskar (sp) and/or Gary to deal with this.  I am getting very upset.  We have 50 to 100 risk book runners who are forced to work late always siting the interest rate curve as the reaon.  
 
Please Help

Jeff,

Steve has been around the block and back.  I have known him for many years and think he is a solid guy.  Might be overkill for your current needs, but worth a send.
Thanks

Jeff:

Thanks again for all of your help today.  It was a great meeting!

I forgot to tell you as we were walking out.  The price for the Bel Geddes
Skyscraper Cocktail service is $7500.  Based on my preliminary price checks
(so far) it seems fair and certainly less that the boys would charge. What
do you think?  I am of half a mind to call the boys and find out what they
would be asking but I think that it would tip our hand....

Hi Joe, 

I mentioned to you an associate from wharton who has been here for 2 years looking for another rotation.  She is very interested in Japan, and a hard worker.  Probably more of a market research, model building, person at this point in her career, but I don't know, and I don't want to sell her short.

What do you have for her?  I'd like to keep her around. 

Jeff

David,

I run a $650 million dollar commodities fund at Harvard Management Company.
Our focus has been on arbitrage strategies in the commodity arena - we are
looking to expand into weather and power. I was wondering, if given the
potential situation at Enron, that there might be employees interested in
interviewing for several positions both within my group and foreign equities
? I apologize if this is too forward or that I have assumed too much in
terms of potential restructurings.

Thanks,

Stuart D. Porter

An older couple were lying in bed one night. The husband was falling
asleep but the wife felt  romantic and wanted to talk.

She said: "You use to hold my hand when we were courting."  Wearily he
reached across, held her hand for a
second and tried to get back to sleep.

A few moments later she said: "Then you used to kiss me." Mildly
irritated, he reached across, gave her a peck
on the cheek and settled down to sleep.

Thirty seconds later she said : "Then you use to bite my neck".
Angrily, he threw back the bed clothes and got out of bed.

"Where are you going ?" she asked.

"To get my teeth !"

It is so nice to hear from you, Jeffrey.  I am  so glad that you weren't on one of those planes or at a meeting in the  Towers.  Personally, I lost several acquaintances and clients, but no  family or friends, so I feel really blessed.  In case you didn't know, my  Hillary worked on the 101st floor in a charity that was located in the Cantor  Fitzgerald offices.  It feels like a hand passed over her and she was  spared, thank god.
 
When the rabbis closed the doors of the ark on Yom  Kippur eve (in Rome's 100 year-old synagogue, btw), I just lost it.  I  started crying for all those who didn't make it to this point, and my heart  yearned to mourn for all of them, to give their souls an aliyah before the doors  of their fate were sealed, but the emotions of it were just overwhelming.   Words (for once) fail me.
 
I hope your Kippur was with loved ones and deeply  meaningful.  As for me, I'm planning on celebrating Sukkoth tonight with my  families, and then going to Washington Square Park for a quick l'chaim just to  make it kosher.
 
Things have been a bit quiet, but hopefully we'll  have some bites on your two items soon.  I do have a museum interested in  the Galle.
 
I am looking forward to sending you the most recent  batch of masterpieces you got here.  You really are developing a great  collection.
 
Thanks for your good wishes,
 
Love,
ben

I thought I'd be travelling this entire week, but it turns out I will be in the Houston office Friday morning until 11am. 
Can we get together for 15-30 minutes sometime between 7-11am to discuss several  Wharton matters?
If you're unavailable then, I'll leave you a voice mail instead.
Thks-- Christie
Ps: when are you meeting with the dean?

Subject:	Cost Reductions-- and Better Information Across EWS

JS & MM:

Here is a quick summary of some my thoughts with regard to fundamentals as we begin finalization objectives and goals for 2002. I would like to discuss these issues with both you next week.

EWS Fundamentals: The Time Has Come

Phyically We are Together but "Informationally" We are Not:
ECS will be great for increasing phyisical proximity, but what are we doing to increase the flow of information across desks, commodities and people.
The MSG Board is a first step in the right direction
But we need to finish the "last mile". Information is still not disseminated effectively. 

Better Information and Rationalization of Resources
It time to consider having one EWS fundamentals site. 
It is both silly and a waste of resources to have  multiple models for various commodities.
Information and efforts need to be shared across the company.
Having multiples sites also limits information flow to trading. Traders should not have to search across multiple sites to receive information.
Why are 3 different analysts doing the same job in three different groups. (Example: Power, Gas, Crude--all do their own API analysis- why have 3? keep the best one and make it stronger.

Publications and IT are Expensive
This year we have eliminated duplication within EGM with regard to publications. It is now time to move cost consolidation across EWS.
Some publications cost in excess of  $100K per year. All duplication needs to be eliminated.
It is very expensive to keep 3 IT teams developing 3 different fundy sites. In EGM alone, this year we have  spent $1.5MM on IT.
We need to stop the island mentality. Leveraging off one platform could easily save millions.

I look forward to discussing these issues and receiving your feedback.
Thanks
Jen

Hi Joe,

I mentioned to you an associate from wharton who has been here for 2 years looking for another rotation.  She is very interested in Japan, and a hard worker.  Probably more of a market research, model building, person at this point in her career, but I don't know, and I don't want to sell her short.

What do you have for her?  I'd like to keep her around.

Jeff

According to sources, El Paso's (Coastal's) 290kb/d refinery was entirely shut about two weeks ago after a power failure.  Among the units shut are a crude unit, two large hydrotreaters and two cokers.  Only one crude unit and a few small hydrotreaters are currently running, bringing total refinery output to only 85kb/d.

Even before this incident, the refinery was running at a reduced rate of about 160kb/d, awaiting the restart of a new visbreaker that burned in a fire last April.

As we understand it, the plan is to start heating one large hydrotreater tonight and have it up and running in about 7 days, then the other will come up. After the first hydrotreater comes up, the other crude unit and the new visbreaker will restart. 

In the shipping market, we hear they are long time-charters and reoffering.  Sources have also seen them buying jet into Boston as well as low-sulfur diesel/jet off the USGC for Florida.

I was out of the loop last week, but I don't think this outage has been reported as of this afternoon.  Apologies if it has been.

Hey Jeff,

I talked with Rob about all of this...but just wanted to keep you posted. 

I talked to a friend (head scheduler) at LOOP and he said that LOOP was closed (not really closed, they actually went to minimal operations) because there were no vessels demanding LOOP offloading and storage this week for that 70+ hour period of time.  When I asked him about this last weekend (9-12) he told me that, same as last week, "there just simply weren't any vessels wanting to unload crude."

   Hey Jeff.  Have a favor to ask.  Trying to get clarification on the
   Enron
   balance sheet.  If you have some time can we speak about various aspects
   of
   the business?  I know you are busy, and not necessarily as familiar with
   the
   off balances sheet structures, but perhaps you could be of some
   assistance.
   I think your the smartest guy I know that still works there.  Maybe its
   your
   Penn roots.

   I am in Houston over Thanksgiving.  Perhaps we can finally get that long
   awaited drink you owe me!  If in London please give me a call.  I have a
   great place here you are welcome to crash at.

Subject:	RE: EnronOnline Budgeting Method

We can't wait for another meeting - we are in front of the OOC on Monday with the Enron Americas plan.

Here's my numbers (I got them from etrade!!!!!):

0 - 5000 transactions per day		$  8:00/normal transaction (including internals)
> 5,000 transactions			$ 10:00/normal transaction 
Options					$ 10:00/ per option (using option grid)
Take or Pay				Minumum Number of transactions per annum = 1,000,000
Service Interruption (outage)		Reduction in our bill of $100,000		(less than 30 minutes)
					Reduction in our bill of $500,000		(greater then 30 minutes)
Per product type set up 			0		(its in your interest as the number of transactions is high in ENA.  It think this issue is for other groups.)
On development 			0		(its in your interest - I think this again an issue for other groups.)

Now we all have the same incentive - grow the number of trades. I think this is pretty close for us.  Only paying once for a sleeve trade.

Let the games begin!

Louise

Subject:	EnronOnline Budgeting Method

As you each have heard over the past few days, EnronOnline is currently looking at a new methodology for charging the business units for services in 2002.  We intend to move away from an allocation mindset into one where services (in the form of products, transactions, and development) are charged on a usage basis, allowing the business units to scale and develop their markets in a more cost responsive way.  My assistant will be contacting your offices to schedule 30 minutes with each of you on Friday, Oct 19th to go over the proposed plan and discuss its impact on next year's budget.  I am confident that this process will yield a method that accurately reflects the cost of EnronOnline and allows each of you to make sound financial decisions about your plans to use EnronOnline in 2002.

Please don't hesitate to call me before Friday with questions, and I look forward to meeting with you.

Brad Richter

Hi Darren,

I am sorry it has taken me so long to reconnect with you, but as you know, it has been very difficult these days at Enron.  It would be best if we could schedule a phone call some time during the first half of December.  At that time, I should have some time to help you.  Hang in there.

Best,

Jeff

Dear Jeffrey,
Lisa thought that you could answer some of my questions dealing with power and gas trading. I have traded equities for the last three years and I worked at a small investment commercial real-estate firm before I traded. I am trying to position myself at an energy company that produces, trades, and sells. I understand that I need to learn the industry from the bottom-up. I am looking at positions of Risk Analyst and Merchant Energy Trader. Do you have any suggestions for me.
 
Sincerely,
Darren Wolfe

An old hillbilly farmer had a wife who nagged him unmercifully.  From
morning 'til night (and sometimes later), she was always complaining about
something.  The only time he got any relief was when he was out plowing
with his old mule.  He plowed a lot.

One day, when he was out plowing, his wife brought him lunch in the field.
He drove the old mule into the shade, sat down on a stump, and began to eat
his lunch.  Immediately, however, his wife began haranguing him again.
Complain, nag, nag; it just went on and on.  All of a sudden, the
old mule lashed out with both hind legs and caught her smack in the back of
the head, killing her dead on the spot.

At the funeral several days later, the minister noticed something rather
odd.  When a woman mourner would approach the old farmer, he would listen
for a minute then nod his head in agreement; but when a man approached him,
he would listen for a minute then shake his head in disagreement.  This was
so consistent, the minister decided to ask the old farmer about it.

So after the funeral, the minister spoke to the old farmer, and asked him
why he nodded his head and agreed with the women but always shook his head
and disagreed with the men.

The old farmer said, "Well, the women would come up and say something about
what a wonderful person my wife was, so I'd nod my head in agreement."

"And what about the men?" the minister asked.

"They all wanted to know if my mule was for sale."

Dear Mr LeBeau:
How's it going? Thank you for returning my call today. As you may remember, I met you, Mr Shankman, Ms Leibman, and Ms Li Sun at Cavanaughs with Matt Commons on Wednesday October 3rd. 

During that meeting, Mr Shankman suggested that I visit Enron down in Houston in the next few weeks. As I have not been placed on the closed interview list at Wharton, I was wondering if I could conduct the interview process while in Houston? Please see my updated resume attached for your review.

Please let me know if this would be possible. I am still very interested in obtaining a full-time position in the Associate Program at Enron.

Kind regards,
Edward Divgi

Jeff,
 
If you could loan me the $5000, I can have that paid back to you by the first of November.  I have someone who wants the 5 acres but will not close on his house until the end of October.  I hope you will consider.  This would be the first time for me to ever own a home.  I don't have any other way of making this happen.
 
I want let you down.  This is a once in a lifetime deal for me.  I have so much to gain by this.  If I ever had to sell the house, it is worth $145,000.
 
Thanks,
 
Donnis

Hi Donnis,

I know it has been hard selling the land, but we need to come up with a payment schedule, or your will need to give me the land valued at $11,500.  What do you prefer.  In light of the difficult times at the company these days, I'd like to get this resolved.

Thanks for understanding.

The NoxTech tests in Scotland have been delayed by mechanical conditions in the test boiler.  It will take 2 - 3 days to perform the boiler repairs and restart the test.  

While we have not been able to conduct extensive tests - the initial NOx reductions were in line with expectations.  On the downside the ammonia slip was fairly high - which will have to be addressed during the next phase of testing.

Assuming MB can get the boiler fixed - expect to have more complete test results by the end of the week.  It is still our intent to find a financial player (Ross - ArcLight - Cline) to buy 3 - 5% of our 50% interest in Clean Energy Solutions.  We are trying to prove a valuation of plus $20 mm for our interest - and do a "140" deal by mid - end November.

Will advise any updates.

George

Enron Troubles Only the Tip of the Iceberg?

Dealings with a related party have tarnished Enron's (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) reputation and crushed its stock, but it looks like that case is far from unique. 
The battered energy trader has done business with at least 15 other related entities, according to documents supplied by lawyers for people suing Enron. Moreover, Enron's new CFO, who has been portrayed by bulls as opposing the related-party dealings of his predecessor, serves on 12 of these entities. And Enron board members are listed as having directorships and other roles at a Houston-based related entity called ES Power 3. 
The extent of Enron's dealings with these companies, or the value of its holdings in them, couldn't be immediately determined. But the existence of these partnerships could feed investors' fears that Enron has billions of dollars of liabilities that don't show up on its balance sheet. If that's so, the company's financial strength and growth prospects could be much less than has generally been assumed on Wall Street, where the company was long treated with kid gloves. 
Enron didn't immediately respond to questions seeking details about ES Power or about the role of the chief financial officer, Jeff McMahon, in the various entities. Enron's board members couldn't immediately be reached for comment. 
Ten Long Days
Enron's previous CFO, Andrew Fastow, was replaced by McMahon Wednesday after investors criticized Fastow's role in a partnership called LJM, which had done complex hedging transactions with Enron. As details of this deal and two others emerged, Enron stock cratered. 
The turmoil that resulted in Fastow's departure began two weeks ago, when Enron reported third-quarter earnings that met estimates. However, the company failed to disclose in its earnings press release a $1.2 billion charge to equity related to unwinding the LJM transactions. Since then, investors and analysts have been calling with increasing vehemence for the company to divulge full details of its business dealings with other related entities. Enron stock sank 6% Friday, meaning it has lost 56% of its value in just two weeks.

However, Enron has yet to break out a full list of related entities. The company has said nothing publicly about McMahon's participation in related entities, nor has it mentioned that its board members were directors or senior officers in ES Power 3. (Nor has it explained the extensive use of Star Wars-related names by the related-party companies.) It's not immediately clear what ES Power 3 is or does. So far, subpoenas issued by lawyers suing Enron have determined the names of senior officers of ES Power 3 and its formation date, January 1999. 
Among ES Power 3's senior executives are Enron CEO Ken Lay, listed as a director, and McMahon and Fastow, listed as executive vice presidents. A raft of external directors are named as ES Power 3 directors, including Comdisco CEO Norman Blake and Ronnie Chan, chairman of the Hong Kong-based Hang Lung Group. A Comdisco spokeswoman says Blake isn't commenting on matters concerning Enron and a call to the Hang Lung group wasn't immediately returned. 
Demands, Demands
Rating agencies Moody's, Fitch and S&P recently put Enron's credit rating on review for a possible downgrade after an LJM deal that led to the $1.2 billion hit to equity. Enron still has a rating three notches above investment grade. But its bonds trade with a yield generally seen on subinvestment grade, or junk, bonds, suggesting the market believes downgrades are likely. 
If Enron's rating drops below investment grade, it must find cash or issue stock to pay off at least $3.4 billion in off-balance sheet obligations. In addition, many of its swap agreements contain provisions that demand immediate cash settlement if its rating goes below investment grade. 
Friday, the company drew down $3 billion from credit lines to pay off commercial paper obligations. Raising cash in the CP market could be tough when investors are jittery about Enron's condition. 
This week, a number of energy market players reduced exposure to Enron. However, in a Friday press release, CEO Lay said that Enron was the "market-maker of choice in wholesale gas and power markets." He added: "It is evident that our customers view Enron as the major liquidity source of the global energy markets." 
McMahon reportedly objected to Fastow's role in LJM, allegedly believing it posed Fastow with a conflict of interests. But he will need to convince investors that the 12 entities he's connected to don't do the same. Enron has said that its board fully approved of the LJM deals that Fastow was involved in. Now, board members will have to comment on their own roles in a related entity. 

Under The Radar: Enron's Flickering Bulb

While the bulb at Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) may not have burnt out, it's clearly flickering. To date, investors aren't sure whether Chairman and CEO Ken Lay is up to the task of re-energizing the company he once built to greatness. 
What's happened at the Houston energy giant-turned-dwarf could've been imagined with any number of ne'er-do-well companies during the well-chronicled bubble. But this is Enron. As one longtime Enron bull and shareholder said, "I never had to worry about Enron's ability to survive until this week. I still find it hard to believe." 
Peter Eavis has done an exceptional job of chronicling Enron's adventures for some time. If you'd listened to him earlier this year, you'd have profited from his knowledge. His reporting on Enron's partnership shenanigans to the departure of Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow has been outstanding. 
The rumors -- from a pending bankruptcy to a Justice Department investigation -- are, for now, just that. And, Enron did not single-handedly cause the California power crisis, nor is Royal Dutch/Shell (RD:NYSE - news - commentary) about to make a bid to buy the company. Sources do tell me that head-count reductions are likely through employee buyout offers and the company is set to refocus on its core energy business. And, while former CEO Jeff Skilling shares culpability for the current mess, his departure appears only indirectly related to Enron's current woes. 
Now, Enron faces the daunting challenge of rebuilding both its business and, more importantly, its reputation. 
The Company's Challenge
But what does Enron do now? It's very simple. Come clean, clean up the mess and refocus on its core business: wholesale energy markets, risk management and retail energy services. They support each other and create a platform that can be plenty profitable without a lot of gimmicks. 
"Our gut feel is that Enron can pull it off, and long-term investors should hold firm, as eventually the stock gets valued on earnings, with upside potential to $25 per share over the next 12-18 months," says Jeff Dietert, power analyst at Simmons & Co. and a member of the TSC Energy Roundtable. "We believe new money with high risk tolerance should wait until Enron announces its intentions for communicating a clear path to recovery." 
Dietert outlines four challenges for Enron. One, management must regain the Street's confidence and persuade investors that it can resolve balance-sheet strength and generate the expected earnings and cash flow. Two, Enron must maintain its investment-grade credit rating. Three, Enron must successfully execute its divestiture plans. Four, Enron must control the timing of the recognition of the write-down in the value of any assets where market value is less than book. 
Straightforward? Yes. Easy to accomplish? No. 
Although Enron says additional write-downs are unlikely -- except a $200 million charge early next year as the result of an accounting change -- analysts aren't so sure. They're focused on the company's Global Assets portfolio, sporting $6 billion in book value but generating an EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) loss of $18 million over the past 12 months. 
The divestitures include $390 million in exploration and production assets in India, $250 million in a Puerto Rico power plant and $250 million in a Brazilian power plant in the fourth quarter as well as the pending sale of Portland General, which is set to close in 2002. There will likely be others. However, Enron has to execute here, and given the current state of its affairs, the seller will feel the pressure. 
The credit-rating issue is a fine line. The current ratings, BBB+ from Standard & Poor's and Baa1 from Moody's, are three levels above non-investment grade. However, both rating agencies now have Enron on their radar screens for possible downgrades. Dietert estimates that Enron's debt-to-market cap will be about 48% by year-end, and the company has interest coverage (EBITDA/ interest expense) of about 3.5 times. By comparison, the average S&P BBB-rated company has a debt-to-cap of 47.4% and interest coverage of about 6.1 times. The average BB company has debt-to-cap of 61.3% and interest expense of 3.8 times. 
Frankly, everything falls on Enron's management team and its ability to reassure investors. "If Enron's management does not step up to calm investor fears, these fears could become a self-fulfilling prophecy," Dietert says. "In the potentially vicious cycle, investor fears could drive stocks down; the lower stock prices force the rating agencies to consider downgrades; potentially lower credit ratings force counter-parties to reduce exposure to Enron, limiting Enron's ability to generate earnings and cash flow." 
It's time for Enron to grow up. Despite a lot of uncertainties and risk, I think it will. Investors with risk capital should do their homework on the stock and think about strategy. It's a tough call that requires strict, individual discipline. 
There's an irony to this whole story, especially in Enron's lack of candor in reporting its financial results. In a much-lauded advertising campaign, Enron, looking to challenge conventional wisdom, asks the simple question, "Why? Ask why." 
Investors are now asking. It's time for Ken Lay to answer.

DJ Enron Unit,New England Market Downplay Report Of Default

Services last week that, for the third time in 12 months, it had traded a
greater volume of electricity than allowed by the bond it had posted and was at
risk for expulsion from New England's market. 

  But it was administrative mixups, rather than financial problems, that
triggered the warning, which a few other companies have also received in the
past, the market's rulemaker said. 

  "I can state with considerable confidence that there have been other
participants" that have defaulted on their credit agreements, "and it's never
been in the news," said David Doot, secretary and general counsel for the New
England Power Pool, which developed the policies governing the region's
electricity market. "My instinct is that this is blown way the hell out of
proportion." 

  News of the Enron unit's default appeared in a trade publication and a major
metropolitan newspaper this week, as Enron's dealings with partnerships headed
by its former chief financial officer contributed to a plunge in the company's
stock and bond prices. 

  Enron Energy Services never received word that it had defaulted on its
bonding requirement twice before, because both times it corrected the problem
within a day, spokeswoman Peggy Mahoney said. 

  The letter sent by ISO New England, which operates the region's power market,
to notify the Enron unit of its third violation was addressed to the wrong
person, delaying the company's response, Mahoney said. 

  "Clearly, it was an administrative error that we immediately took care of to
ensure that we would never exceed the volume limit," Mahoney said. 

  The company resolved the problem by Oct. 19, Mahoney said. ISO New England
spokeswoman Ellen Foley confirmed Friday that the company had cured its
default. 

  It's rare for a company to default three times, but it has happened on
occasion, Foley and Doot said. 

  "I won't say it's commonplace, but I won't say it's unusual for a participant
to find itself out of compliance," Doot said. "Those things have in fact
happened from time to time."

Enron Lawsuit Over Microsoft Broadband Agreement May Block MSN
2001-10-26 16:47 (New York)

Enron Lawsuit Over Microsoft Broadband Agreement May Block MSN

     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s lawsuit
alleging Microsoft breached a contract for broadband services
could temporarily block the largest software company's high-speed
Internet service in some U.S. regions.

     Microsoft said the dispute temporarily blocks the company
from providing the high-speed service in areas where Enron
provides broadband access, leaving MSN fully operational only in
the 14 states where Qwest Communications International Inc.
operates, said Bob Visse, director of marketing for MSN.

     Enron's lawsuit was filed yesterday. Microsoft had planned to
offer fast Internet access in 45 cities beginning yesterday to
give the largest software company access to potential customers in
29 million homes. Microsoft, the No. 2 U.S. Internet provider, is
making a push to win customers from AOL Time Warner Inc.

     ``We are trying to resolve the issues with Enron as quickly
as possible and at the same time we are evaluating other
providers,'' Visse said.

     Officials at Houston-based Enron, the largest energy trader,
did not immediately return calls for comment.

                         The Agreement

     Enron in June signed an agreement with Microsoft to provide
bandwidth for MSN Internet service. Under the agreement, Enron
isn't required to deliver operational broadband services if
Microsoft hasn't first provided a billing and ordering system, Dow
Jones newswire reported.

     Enron claims in its lawsuit that Microsoft failed to deliver
the ordering and billing system required in the initial phase of
the deal, Dow reported.

     Enron's lawsuit comes after Microsoft said in an Oct. 23
letter that Enron will have breached the contract if it hasn't
provided an operational bandwidth system by Oct. 25, allowing
Microsoft to recover damages.

     Shares of Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft fell 36 cents
to $62.20, while Enron shares fell 95 cents to $15.40.

Enron Executives Sent Requests for Details of Affiliate Profits

Enron Executives Sent Requests for Details of Affiliate Profits

     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Lawyers for a shareholder
suing Enron Corp. are asking executives of the largest energy
trader to disclose any income they made from their involvement
with affiliated companies that bought and sold Enron assets.

     Lawyers have made the requests to President Greg Whalley,
Vice Chairman Mark Frevert and Chief Financial Officer Jeff
McMahon and 83 other employees arrived at Enron's Houston offices
this week, said Paul Paradis, a partner in the New York law firm
Abbey Gardy. Requests also were sent to 17 Enron partnerships such
as Whitewing Management and Marlin Water.

     Paradis represents Fred Greenberg, an Enron shareholder who
is suing the company's board for allowing former Chief Financial
Officer Andrew Fastow to run partnerships that cost the company at
least $35 million in cash and $1.2 billion in lost shareholder
equity.

     The requests are aimed at determining if Enron executives
benefited financially from roles as officers and directors of
partnerships that bought and sold company assets. Enron formed at
least 18 such affiliated companies, listing executives and
employees as officers and directors of the partnerships, according
to Texas secretary of state records.

     Under Texas law, failure to respond to the document requests
will result in subpoenas being issued. Subpoenas could go out next
week if responses don't arrive by then, Paradis said. Enron
spokeswoman Karen Denne didn't respond to requests for comment
about the document requests.

     The executives earned no income from the partnerships, Enron
spokesman Mark Palmer has said. ``There are no financial interests
in the structures themselves for any Enron employee,'' Palmer
said. He said it's common for a company to name its executives to
the boards of affiliates.

                       Affiliates Have Debts

     Texas records show Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay,
Frevert, Whalley, McMahon and dozens of other people who list
their address as Enron's corporate headquarters serving as
officers and directors of limited liability companies and foreign
business corporations.

     The document requests ask Enron executives for information on
any form of compensation or benefit received from any of the
affiliates, including stock grants and options. They also ask the
executives to disclose any equity or partnership interests in the
affiliates.

     Enron formed many of the affiliates to buy company assets
such as power plants and natural-gas pipelines. That allowed Enron
to move debt associated with those projects off its books.

     The affiliates bought the assets with borrowed money. They
plan to repay the debt by eventually selling the assets. Enron
might be liable for any shortfall between the sales proceeds and
the debt. That could amount to at least $3.3 billion if the assets
don't generate any money, a remote possibility, the company has
said.

                            Few Answers

     Investors and analysts pressed Enron Chief Executive Officer
Kenneth Lay for details on the finances of the partnerships in a
conference call Tuesday.

     Today, Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne didn't respond to
questions about one of them, ES Power 3 LLC.

     Texas records list 78 Enron executives and employees as
officers, directors and managers of ES Power 3 LLC. The entire
Enron board is also listed.

     Shares of Enron $1.15 to $15.20 in late trading.

Enron Still Target in California Amid Other Problems (Update1)
2001-10-26 16:15 (New York)

Enron Still Target in California Amid Other Problems (Update1)

     (Updates with closing share price in last paragraph.)

     Sacramento, California, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.,
facing an inquiry by federal securities regulators into
partnerships run by the former chief financial officer, remains a
target of investigations and lawsuits in California.

     California lawmakers and regulators have accused power
providers of manipulating the state's energy market to raise
prices. Enron, the biggest energy trader, and other power sellers
have denied the charges repeatedly.

     Next month, a California Senate committee investigating the
power market plans to hold a hearing to determine if Enron and
other generators are complying with subpoenas for trading
documents. Enron has been filing documents in Sacramento,
California.

     ``They are still putting documents in their depository, and I
don't think they've completed that process,'' said Alexandra
Montgomery, a consultant to the committee. It ``remains to be
seen'' whether Enron is complying with its subpoena, she said.

     The suits and inquiries came after wholesale power prices in
California soared, leaving the state's two largest utilities
insolvent. Under California's plan to open its electricity market
to competition, the utilities of PG&E Corp. and Edison
International weren't allowed to pass rising costs to customers.

     ``I know that we're doing our best to comply with what the
committee is asking for,'' Enron spokesman Mark Palmer. ``We are
putting documents in the depository, and we're looking forward to
a speedy resolution.''

     Shares of Houston-based Enron have fallen by more than half
since Oct. 16. The company ousted Andrew Fastow as the chief
financial officer Wednesday amid a U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission inquiry into a partnership he ran that cost Enron $35
million.

                            Grand Jury

     Enron also is one of the companies being investigated for
civil and criminal violations by California Attorney General Bill
Lockyer, who convened a grand jury in June.

     Lockyer has been criticized by Enron officials for telling
the Wall Street Journal in May that he would like to put Enron
Chairman Kenneth Lay in ``an 8 x 10 cell that he could share with
a tattooed dude who says `Hi my name is Spike, honey.' '' Lockyer
later apologized for the remark.

     The attorney general's investigation is proceeding, Lockyer
spokeswoman Sandra Michioku said. Michioku said she didn't know
when civil or criminal charges against Enron or other power
providers might be filed.

     ``Our investigation is still being pursued,'' she said. ``We
had to go to court to get Enron to turn over documents, so that
slowed things down a bit.''

     Enron's Palmer said he didn't know the status of the attorney
general's investigation.

     ``I think the attorney general demonstrated his willingness
to take a fair and impartial look a long time ago when he made his
vulgar and unfounded remarks about our chairman,'' Palmer said.

                           More Lawsuits

     Enron, along with other major power providers such as Duke
Energy Corp. and Dynegy Inc., face at least five lawsuits alleging
they manipulated California energy prices in violation of
antitrust laws.

     The cases, which include separate complaints filed by the
City of San Francisco, California Lieutenant Governor Cruz
Bustamante and various consumers, currently are in state courts
awaiting a coordination proceeding, said Michael Aguirre, a lawyer
representing Bustamante. The lawsuits should be assigned to a
judge by the end of next month, he said.

     If the complaints succeed, the companies might be ordered to
repay profits from any illegal activities and pay fines, including
triple damages.

     Enron's stock fell 95 cents, or 5.8 percent, to $15.40,
declining for the eighth day in a row. The shares have fallen 80
percent in the past 12 months.

Enron Bonds Fall as Company Taps $3 Bln Credit Line (Update5)
2001-10-26 16:18 (New York)

Enron Bonds Fall as Company Taps $3 Bln Credit Line (Update5)

     (Adds investor comment in fourth paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. bonds and shares
fell after the largest energy trader tapped a $3 billion credit
line because it has been shut out of the leading market for low-
interest, short-term loans.

     The company's stock has fallen 54 percent in the past 14 days
after investors questioned its transactions with affiliates run by
Enron's former chief financial officer. The shares fell 95 cents,
or 5.8 percent, to $15.40 today.

     Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay has failed to reassure
investors that the company's credit rating won't be cut, investors
said. Enron can no longer borrow in commercial paper markets,
where short-term loans carry lower rates than banks offer.

     ``Do they have the financial flexibility they once had? No,''
said John Cassady, who helps manage $3 billion in bonds at Fifth
Third Bancorp. ``People are questioning the credibility of
management.''

      The company will use its credit line to pay off $2.2 billion
in commercial paper it has outstanding, Enron spokesman Mark
Palmer said.

                            Bonds Drop

     Enron's 6 3/4 percent bonds, which mature in 2009, declined 1
1/2 points to a bid of 84 cents on the dollar and an offer of 86
cents. At that price, the bonds, which carry a rating of ``BBB+,''
yield 9.53 percent.

     Investors have grown concerned that the company's credit
rating will be cut after $1.01 billion in third-quarter losses
from failed investments. Enron needs good credit to raise cash
daily to keep trading partners from demanding collateral and to
settle transactions.

     Enron's decision to tap its credit line was ``a smart
financial move,'' said Stephen Moore, a vice president at Moody's
Investors Service who follows the company. ``It took away the
hassle and time-consuming nature of rolling commercial paper and
insured access to capital.''

     Though Enron's bonds have investment-grade ratings, their
yield at current prices is higher than those of industrial bonds
that carry junk ratings. According to Bloomberg data, companies
with ``BB'' ratings pay on average 9.16 percent to borrow for
seven years.

     A lower credit rating may also force Enron to buy back
holdings in other partnerships with its stock, diluting the value
of Enron investors' stock.

     Partnerships called Whitewing, Marlin and Yosemite own Enron
assets they bought with borrowed money. Enron sold the assets to
the partnerships to keep related debt off its books. The
partnerships plan to repay the borrowed money by selling the
assets.

                         Other Liabilities

     If Enron loses investment-grade rating, the borrowed money
comes due earlier, leaving less time for the partnerships to find
the best price for the power plants and other assets. Enron would
have to make up any shortfall between what the assets would sell
for and the amount of the debt.

     One way would be issuing common shares to exchange for Enron
preferred convertible shares held by the partnerships. That would
thin out the holdings of every other investor.

     Of the two main bond-rating companies, Moody's and Fitch have
Enron on watch for possible downgrade, and Standard & Poor's
lowered Enron's long-term credit outlook to negative. Egan-Jones
Rating Co. today lowered its rating on Enron's debt to ``BB+,''
one notch below investment grade, from ``BBB-.''

     Enron's liabilities associated with the partnerships amount
to at least $3.3 billion, the company has said.

     Enron ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow on
Wednesday amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into a
partnership he ran that cost the company $35 million in direct
losses. Enron also bought back 62 million shares from the
partnership, reducing shareholder equity by $1.2 billion.

     ``It looks like the guy who was supposed to do everything for
the benefit of shareholders was running partnerships for the
benefit of himself,'' Fifth Third's Cassady said.

     Jeff McMahon, head of Enron's industrial markets group, was
named CFO in a bid to restore investor confidence, Lay said in a
statement.

Keller Rohrback L.L.P. Investigates Potential Claims on Behalf of Enron Corp. -- ENE -- Employees and Former Employees

10/26/2001
Business Wire
(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)

SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 26, 2001--Seattle's Keller Rohrback L.L.P. is currently investigating potential ERISA claims on behalf of participants and beneficiaries of Enron's retirement and 401(k) plans. 
The investigation period covers January 2000 through October 2001. The investigation focuses on concerns that, under the law interpreting ERISA, Enron and its plan administrators may have breached their fiduciary duties of loyalty and prudence by failing to disclose and inform the Plan participants and beneficiaries with respect to the use of employer stock as a Plan investment. Rather than providing complete and accurate information to the Plans' participants, it may be alleged that Enron and the plan administrators may have withheld and concealed material information, thereby encouraging participants and beneficiaries to continue to make and to maintain substantial investments in company stock and the Plans. This investigation is being conducted in light of recent events.
On Oct. 16, 2001, Enron surprised the market when it announced that the Company was taking "non-recurring charges totaling $1.01 billion after-tax, or ($1.11) loss per diluted share," in the third quarter of 2001. Enron later revealed that a material portion of the charge related to the unwinding of investments with certain limited partnerships, controlled by Enron's CFO, and that the Company would be eliminating more than $1 billion in shareholder equity as a result of its unwinding of the investments. As this news began to be assimilated by the market, the price of Enron common stock dropped significantly. In addition, several recently filed securities suits allege that Enron executives engaged in extensive insider trading, gaining millions of dollars in personal proceeds. Enron retirees have lost a substantial portion of their retirement earnings due to the drop in value of their retirement assets. 
If you are a member of an Enron retirement plan, wish to discuss this announcement, or have information relevant to the investigation, you may contact paralegal Liza Catabay, or any member of our team (Britt Tinglum, Liza Catabay, or Lynn Sarko) toll free at 800/776-6044, or via e-mail at investor@kellerrohrback.com. 
Seattle's Keller Rohrback L.L.P. has successfully represented shareholders and consumers in class action cases for over a decade. Its trial lawyers have obtained judgments and settlements on behalf of clients in excess of seven billion dollars.

Subject:	2002 Plan : A Request for Guidance

JS;
I have been working on the 2002 EGM Plan. With this in mind, could you please give me some guidance on the following topics;

1- Headcount: Per my previous email (Fundy Update- I do not expect to increase headcount in H1-02 with the exception of the outstanding offer)
2-Spending on publications and other data sources: Can you please tell me which businesses I should focus the most on. 
3-Resources: Again which areas should efforts be focused on.
4-London: We will have 5 people there in January (1 director, 1 manager, 3 analysts). If you are still considering bringing the crude team to London, please let me know before any move/viasa/etc expenses are incurred.


Thank you for your assistance.
JF

Jeff,

The below is a draft requesting the creation of  a JCC book and an outline =
on how the commodity and FX risks will be managed.  I have not included any=
 limits as we should discuss these before hand.  A good deal of work has be=
en done by Research, FX (Shane) and one of our guys, Rousseau Anai.  I have=
 also included the basic swap model (with hard coded numbers if you are int=
erested in road testing) that we have created incorporating a good deal of =
the work as well.  I showed this to Nowlan while in Cabo and he seemed happ=
y.  What I am suggesting, however, is that John does not have to wear the r=
esearch and fx risk.  We we hold this, but be hedged using the methodologie=
s described in the note and research's hedge ratios.  Research would contin=
ue to be involved and evaluating the validity and the correlations on a rea=
l time basis.  Lastly and perhaps most importantly, we would not be startin=
g with the biggest deals in the world.  Small, near term and short duration=
s will help us prove the concept and refine our understanding.

I look forward to speaking to you about this.

Joe

Does EGM management support quoting prices for financial JCC business developed by the Tokyo office? Is so, we need to communicate that to Bill White, Chris Glaas and Richard Slovenski. If not, then we need to tell Joe and his troops. My assesment (and please correct me if I am wrong) is that the long term success of our Singapore and Tokyo offices is dependent on how they interact on physical and financial trades (like Project Sato) in the region.

With Joe Hirl in town tomorrow with Nissho Iwai I'm sure the subject of JCC hedging will come up. As you know Marc de la Roche and I have been working with Enron's Research department and it appears Nelson Neale has done some great work on JCC and it's relationship to Brent crude. I also understand that you are not inclined to want to quote prices for the JCC index. Is that a fair statement? Where I become confused is that the management in Houston supports the Tokyo office efforts and yet unless the Global Products Singapore office steps up to help, then neither office will prosper. Trust me, I do not want the Singapore office to bear all of the price/basis risk of the Tokyo office, but if we can't compete with Morgan Stanley or J. Aron then why do we have either office? I will talk to Hirl, Shankman and McConnell and see what they want Global Products to do or not do regarding JCC hedging. Your comments on this subject would be much appreciated.

The times they are a changin.

We plan to meet with these guys directly and through NIC (they have strong relationship with Tohoku) in the very near future to talk about other coal based derivatives and structures (Sydney is involved).  This effort was already underway before this announcement.  I met the President of Tohoku about two weeks ago and indicated possible opportunities.  We are trying to repair relationships here as EPower's major (and premature) announcements at the beginning of the year pissed them off to no end.

Tohoku Electric To Buy Coal, Emissions Allowances Together 


TOKYO (Nikkei)--Tohoku Electric Power Co. (9506) announced Wednesday that it has agreed to purchase coal and gas emissions allowances from two Australian firms as a set, marking the first deal in Japan in which fuel and emissions rights have been bought in this manner.

Tohoku Electric will sign with Powercoal Pty Ltd. and Centennial Coal Co. a multiyear contract taking effect in fiscal 2002. The two partners will supply the Japanese firm with coal as well as emissions allowances gained by reducing gas emissions in Australia. The price and volume of the allowances have yet to be determined.

Powercoal expects to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by about 1.6 million tons a year by collecting methane gas produced through coal mining and other activities. Centennial Coal plans to reduce CO2 by 25,000 tons a year by planting trees.

Tohoku Electric officials believe that gas emissions allowances will eventually be traded on a market, but that they would be able to purchase them more cheaply if they signed a contract before an emissions trading system is started.

I'm going to reserve it tomorrow and see if we can get AIA to fund it.  If
not, we will figure out a way...

How is your Thursday and Friday for a meeting with Peter?  He is available
Thursday 11-2 and Friday 2-5.  I think we will need about a hour.

ml.</span></p>

<p><span class="text2">As Turning Leaf wines are handcrafted for
perfection, a majority of the grapes for Turning Leaf were selected
from some of the finest vineyards in the Lodi region. A major
winegrape-growing region since the 1850s, Lodi is increasingly
looked to by leading California wineries for grapes of superior
quality. The warm days and cool nights of its Mediterranean climate
allow the grapes to develop excellent color and maintain crisp acid
levels through to harvest. The end result is a well-balanced
fruit-forward Chardonnay with excellent varietal
character.</span></p>

Guys,

As of this morning, these are the counterparties that are not trading with us:

BHP Billiton--no coal, yes vessels

Koch-generally no crude and products, but they have traded some small weather products.

Shell  (Stasco, Equiva)--no trades

Bank of Montreal--no trades  (started several weeks ago)

Phibro--appear to be no trades, but hard to confirm

BP--no trades.

Diamond Shamrock has a very small spread position on with us, and asked us to find someone to stand between.

Sempra is looking at their exposure to us in physical products, and asking questions about our docs.

Innogy--In Europe, no longer trading weather with us.

ICE--The Majors have cut us off.

More info to follow as discovered.

Jeff

Dear Jeffrey,
Lisa thought that you could answer some of my questions dealing with power and gas trading. I have traded equities for the last three years and I worked at a small investment commercial real-estate firm before I traded. I am trying to position myself at an energy company that produces, trades, and sells. I understand that I need to learn the industry from the bottom-up. I am looking at positions of Risk Analyst and Merchant Energy Trader. Do you have any suggestions for me.
 
Sincerely,
Darren Wolfe

Afghanistan Ground War

We believe plans are progressing for ground action in Afghanistan to begin over the next week. Rumsfeld and Bush are both overseas and it is unlikely that the attack would commence prior to their return.  Forces earmarked for deployment include US Marines, US Rangers and British Marines. The Pentagon has reportedly suggested to London that it reclassify its marine commandos and paratroopers as "special forces" so the operation may still be depicted as an SF one. 

The tactical aims of such operations - which will see troops inserted by helicopter from Pakistan and then extracted via the same route - will be to destroy identified Al Qaeda targets in areas theoretically under Taleban control. 

Anthrax

More incidents today with media outlets and politicians being the primary targets.  There is a wide variety of media reporting on this, most of it unreliable.  We reiterate that the U.S. government is equipped to handle isolated incidents of cutaneous anthrax exposures, but is not equipped to handle air-dispersed anthrax attacks on a wider scale, or more contagious biological weapons such as smallpox.  The main impact of the current incidents (aside from those directly affected) is psychological; a further escalation of the sense of worry, which increases both political and economic pressure on the Bush Administration.  Politically, there will be increased pressure "to do something" not only against the bin Laden network, but possibly Iraq. Economically, the anthrax incidents are simply another serious blow to consumer confidence. The Congressional incidents also are delaying passage of the fiscal stimulus package.

Terrorist Sophistication Targeting Critical Infrastructure Not to be Overlooked

The anthrax incidents also represent yet another attack against US critical infrastructure.  Just as the World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks represented attacks on our transportation infrastructure, financial infrastructure, and government infrastructure, so too do the anthrax attacks target our government infrastructure (Congress, Gov. Pataki) and our communications infrastructure (Fox/CBS/ABC/NBC & mail delivery).  Both the September l1th attacks and the anthrax incidents have hit targets that are significant both as critical infrastructure and as symbols of American power.  The threat at Three Mile Island reported last night suggests that the possibility of attacks against energy infrastructure should certainly not be ignored and should probably be expected.

Dear friends,

As discussed in the last executive committee meeting, I am preparing a list
of individuals for Fred Schroeder to "interview" when they are here to work
with us in November.  I'd like to send them 10 to 15 possiblilities as they
can see a good number over the time they're here, and those they don't catch
now can be contacted for a later trip.  Fred suggested we look at this as a
"first wave" of some people who know us well; more interviews with those at
a greater distance will come later.

Please let me know your thoughts.

Greg, David,

While I think you guys have come to some conclusions about layoffs, it is the people we need to keep we need to address now.  We will provide you a list of those that are crucial to keep going forward.

I am extremely concerned about one person in particular--Rob Fuller.  I have done everything I can over the last weeks to make sure he knows we are committed to him, however market rumors are that he could be close to leaving.  We now have to commit to him with dollars on a piece of paper, and any help you can provide tomorrow would be helpful.  I don't think this is a next week issue.

Shanna, I will coordinate with you on the HR front to get Oxley's feedback.

Thanks for your attention.

Hi Bill

We need to send a form 1099 (a tax form showing income to him) to Ed Nayhem who helped ups with the Puryear and the Oldenburg.  We can also write off his fee as en expense to Enron in acquiring this art.

As well, pending a condition report, the Puryear (the piece on view at the Menil) was sold today to the Smithsonian.  Please keep this confidential.  Ned Rifkin does not know and if the buyer chooses to tell him that is fine, but this info should not be told to anyone yet.

We will have a contract next week from the dealer who sold it and I send you a copy.  

A good start--we really did buy some great things.

Jeff

         I've got 2 samples of fabric.  1 plain off white and the other a
      ribbed
         off
         white.  Elizabeth and I prefer the ribbed.
         Plain = $40 retail / $20 cost
         Ribbed = $50 retail  / $25 cost x 34 yards = $850
         I'll give them to you at cost so that we can continue furnishing
   your
         house
         ( I hear it's empty).
         If you have time this afternoon and can walk down to your Lobby I
   can
         meet
         you there to show you the fabrics.  Also, bring down a check so
   that
      I
         can
         stop by Walter Lee Culp and order you couches and fabric ma?ana.
      Fabric
         can
         be overnighted if needed or sent 2 day.
         I think 2 day is plenty of time.

         50% now - (not including taxes)
         50% later + shipping and taxes when couches are ready for delivery
      (6-8
         wks.).

         Need now
         $5445 for 2 loveseats and 1 couch + $850 for fabric = $6295
         I will give you a receipt.
         Let me know when you can see the fabric........

            Retail for couch is $5460 (saving $1170 about  27% lower)
            Retail for loveseat $4200 (saving $900 about 27% lower.)
            I may be able to save you more on the fabric if I can find the
   one
         you
            need
            at Kravets since they give me 50% off.  The majority of the
      furniture
            stores
            only give between a 20-30% off.  The couches take about 6-8
   weeks
      if
            they
            are in stock and usually are.  I'll get some fabric this Friday
         during
            lunch
            and maybe I can show you over coffee that afternoon.  I'll need
   to
         order
            the
            fabric so add another 2 weeks at least before the store gets
   it.
         Also,
            I'll
            find out paying conditions but usually is 50% upfront (cash)
   and
      then
            the
            other 50% when ready for delivery.  They don't take credit
   card.
         Checks
            payable to me and I pay with my company check.
            I'll get moving and call you on Friday.
            Sound good?

               Loveseat = $3300
               8.25% tax = $626.18.
               Total = $8,216.18.  Both w/out fabric.

               You need a total of 23.5 yards of fabric.  I usually get
   about
      a
            30-35%

               the
               Decorative Center and get some fabric samples for you to
   choose
         from.
            I
               have no clue as to how much indoor/outdoor fabric goes for
   but
         I'll
            get

               Thanks for you help.

               The site is www.thewickerworks.com.  Click on it to go
   directly
            there.
               The are in Houston at Walter Lee Culp.  713 623 4670.

               If you go to their web site go to the home page, then to the
      tab
         that
               says wicker, then to the tab that says more.  The design is
      Helva.

               I need 1 Helva sofa, and 2 Helva loveseats, of course in a
   very
         plain
               off white (not tan as one of the pictures shows)
   indoor/outdoor
            fabric.

               Or if you have any other ideas, let me know, of course.

         I've got 2 samples of fabric.  1 plain off white and the other a
      ribbed
         off
         white.  Elizabeth and I prefer the ribbed.
         Plain = $40 retail / $20 cost
         Ribbed = $50 retail  / $25 cost x 34 yards = $850
         I'll give them to you at cost so that we can continue furnishing
   your
         house
         ( I hear it's empty).
         If you have time this afternoon and can walk down to your Lobby I
   can
         meet
         you there to show you the fabrics.  Also, bring down a check so
   that
      I
         can
         stop by Walter Lee Culp and order you couches and fabric ma?ana.
      Fabric
         can
         be overnighted if needed or sent 2 day.
         I think 2 day is plenty of time.

         50% now - (not including taxes)
         50% later + shipping and taxes when couches are ready for delivery
      (6-8
         wks.).

         Need now
         $5445 for 2 loveseats and 1 couch + $850 for fabric = $6295
         I will give you a receipt.
         Let me know when you can see the fabric........

            Retail for couch is $5460 (saving $1170 about  27% lower)
            Retail for loveseat $4200 (saving $900 about 27% lower.)
            I may be able to save you more on the fabric if I can find the
   one
         you
            need
            at Kravets since they give me 50% off.  The majority of the
      furniture
            stores
            only give between a 20-30% off.  The couches take about 6-8
   weeks
      if
            they
            are in stock and usually are.  I'll get some fabric this Friday
         during
            lunch
            and maybe I can show you over coffee that afternoon.  I'll need
   to
         order
            the
            fabric so add another 2 weeks at least before the store gets
   it.
         Also,
            I'll
            find out paying conditions but usually is 50% upfront (cash)
   and
      then
            the
            other 50% when ready for delivery.  They don't take credit
   card.
         Checks
            payable to me and I pay with my company check.
            I'll get moving and call you on Friday.
            Sound good?

               8.25% tax = $626.18.
               Total = $8,216.18.  Both w/out fabric.

               You need a total of 23.5 yards of fabric.  I usually get
   about
      a
            30-35%

               the
               Decorative Center and get some fabric samples for you to
   choose
         from.
            I
               have no clue as to how much indoor/outdoor fabric goes for
   but
         I'll
            get
               a

               The site is www.thewickerworks.com.  Click on it to go

               The are in Houston at Walter Lee Culp.  713 623 4670.

               If you go to their web site go to the home page, then to the
      tab
         that
               says wicker, then to the tab that says more.  The design is
      Helva.

               I need 1 Helva sofa, and 2 Helva loveseats, of course in a
   very
         plain
               off white (not tan as one of the pictures shows)

Jeff-
We are in the process of making the changes that you had requested to be made to the Global Position Report:
Crude - Financial Options (Oil Price 3) - has been broken out as De La Ossa but is still included under "Crude Financial" portfolio.  Do you want us to move this position with the rest of Mario's positions (under the Distillates - Products II) or leave it with Crude?
Some of the "zero" books are still showing on the report.  We have discussed this with the Systems group and we should have the fix in place by Wednesday reporting - they must do some changes behind the scenes.  
The Distillates Spain position is now captured with Mahoney's Distillates positions.
The positions for Thomas under London Crude (Physical & Financial) have been combined.

Please give me a call if you want to further discuss the changes. 
Thanks,
Michelle

The structure is as follows:  Enron Market Claims Trading Corp. ("EMCT"), a=
 Texas corporation and 100 percent subsidiary of Enron Global Markets LLC (=
"EGM"), organized Enron (Bermuda) Limited ("EBL"), a Bermuda corporation an=
d 100 percent subsidiary of EMCT, to serve as the Enron partner in Global R=
isk Strategies (Bermuda), Ltd. ("GRSBL"), a Bermuda organized entity that i=
s treated as a partnership for U.S. tax purposes and in which EBL possesses=
 a 75 percent interest.  Essentially, EGM through two entities (a U.S. enti=
ty and a Bermuda entity) has organized a Bermuda based partnership (that is=
, GRSBL) to engage in the claims trading activity.  In turn, the consequenc=
e of Enron holding its interest in the Bermuda based claims trading busines=
s in this manner is that income derived from such claims trading business w=
ill not be currently taxed by the U.S. and, in fact, will never be taxed so=
 long as the earnings from the activity are not repatriated from EBL to EMC=
T (i.e., from the Bermuda entity to the U.S. entity) - this will reduce EGM=
's effective tax rate because Bermuda does not tax this activity (we applie=
d for and obtained a tax exemption).  Conversely, however, should GRSBL not=
 earn income and instead generate a loss, such loss would not provide a U.S=
. tax deduction and this would operate to increase the EGM effective tax ra=
te (this is similar to the point discussed at the Monday meeting several we=
eks back related to EGM's Singapore business).  Finally, in order to obtain=
 the tax benefit mentioned above, it is important that transactions underta=
ken by GRSBL be executed outside of the U.S. (essentially, we will lose the=
 tax benefit if GRSBL conducts business in the U.S.).  However, transaction=
s that need (for nontax reasons) to be conducted in the U.S. can be underta=
ken by EMCT and (handled in this fashion) not taint GRSBL (since GRSBL is i=
nsulated from EMCT by EBL).

Accordingly, by organizing the claims trading business in the tiered subsid=
iary form described above, we have structured the business in a fashion tha=
t minimizes the tax consequences to EGM and this will, in turn, work to red=
uce the effective tax rate of EGM.  I would be delighted to speak in detail=
 regarding this should you have additional questions and can be reached at =
x30938 or on my cell phone at 713.817.5052.  Best regards.  SHD.

Dear Equity,

Good morning,

I hope you were out shopping this weekend; the sales even got me out.  

We will have a special installment of out Retail Survey this afternoon to
see how this weekend went.  Hopefully the relative strength reported by
TeleCheck will be confirmed.  

The feeling here is Holiday sales and 4Q GDP will surprise, and be strong
versus expectations.  We raised our estimate for 4Q GDP from -2% to -1%.
The next two week's data should determine whether or not we are correct.

The weekly report builds on the "over but not finished" theme we debuted
last week.  The evidence we've had over the last 7 weeks suggests the
recession is ending.  We expect this quarter and next to surprise versus
the consensus, but then in 2H02, the relative strength should peter-out.
The first 7 pages cover this theme and page 6 has the table we love to put
out comparing 4Q retail sales and the Wilshire.

Ed and Nancy spent more time on the previous "hiccups" in bond yields and
what their causes were.  The only thing they could come up with were
rallies in the stock market.  Our estimate for the 10 yr has also been
changed - we now have yields rising to 5.5% in 2Q and falling to 5.3% in 3Q. 

If there is any political risk to the market, it is that it gets jitters
about the stimulus package.  Tom Gallagher reports both parties are acting
surprisingly partisan, but he still bets there is a 2/3 chance the bill
gets done.  Andy Laperriere reports on the Hill - the terrorism insurance
bill should get done in the House this week, benefiting AIG, ALL, CB, and
BRK.  Andy also has a useful table of which AIRLINE is getting how much of
the first half of the bailout.  

Finally, Jim is looking at this market in an "absolute vs. relative" manor.
 Yes, valuations are high.  But there is a lot of liquidity out there (also
highlighted in the EMM) and there is evidence of it "trickling down" into
the high yield and junk markets.  This liquidity makes Jim comfortable with
the idea of the market being able to go a little bit higher in the short
term.  

Have a great day.

Let me know if you need anything else.

George,

I would be happy to discuss with you.  It remains critical that we manage all cash requirements as our access to capital markets has been impacted over the past few weeks.  Hopefully the announcement on Friday will improve our ability to execute transactions like this in future, but prior to Friday this was a necessary precaution.  Unfortunately, you are working at a different company than you were a few weeks ago.

We can discuss next week.

Bill

The Bengalla deal was struck after I had given ECAP notice of the liquidity problems, and more importantly, without any RAC involvement.

>From a RAC perspective this deal is still unapproved.  If an invoice discount facility can be used, or some other means of performing without using Enron capital then you should move forward.  If these options are not available, then the issue should either be raised to Louise Kitchen for approval or unwound until the liquidity problems are resolved.

		John:

		I assume this does not apply to ECTRL business, as we have not been given a reciprocal recommendation for European biz.  Can you confirm this?  Also, can you clarify what the specific issue is with ECAP that is not an issue with ECTRL?  Is this specific to cash flow within Australian entities?

		Thanks,

		Stu

			In light of the current situation in Houston, I recommend we wait to finalize any physical coal sourcing or deliveries in the ECAP business.  In short, RAC cannot approve any purchase or sale until the liquidity issues are resolved.  Hopefully by the end of the week we will know more, have things settled, and business can continue as normal.

			Please call me if you have any questions.

As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

Year to date we have transacted 790,000 tonnes of financial deals for the Petrochemical industy globally.
Already transacted Cal 02 benzene swap with Dupont USA.
USA olefines has been targeted for increase in deal flow Q3/Q4.

OPTIONS
Enron's first Benzene options transacted in Europe. 

EOL
Styrene swap now launched in Europe and the USA one to follow soon.
4 new counterparties transacting.

NEW HIRES/PERSONNEL
I have interviewed 1 person ( Marathon employee) with a view to running our fledgling USA distribution business and "ghosting" the traders on Styrene, Toluene and Xylene.
We are in the process of interviewing a physical trader for London.
I expect Chris Shapland in Europe will be trading financial petchems in London by the return of the year and a junior replacement for him will then be required.
Rob Brewis is making great progress on market penetration and I expect to be trading physical olefines by Q4 in Europe.
USA Plastics group still needs a trader.

FUNDAMENTALS
Work is underway on the Europe web site. An analyst for this work is being sort. Meanwhile Chris is helping in the interim.

PROJECT WORK
Meeting with CONOCO Europe set for  Sep 4 to discuss taking all their Benzene and Propylene output either physically or financially.

Recent discussions with NCT ,a Dutch plastics distibutor, proved very interesting. Idea is to take a share in the company to have access to their physical exposure on Plastics/Polymers in Europe with a view to providing a new source of physical supply to NCT and manage their total price exposure fro their total sales volume. NCT turnover is c $91m. 

Push on Propylene in Europe seen as the most attractive Olefin for Q4.

USA Aromatics dist business on Toluene ready to go.

Major interest from USA majors in Cal 02 Styrene and Benzene swaps.

PHYSICAL BUSINESS
Last but not least I almost forgot ,somehow we still keep very active on physical transactions across the whole range of products . With the hopeful addition of 2 new people we will be increasing our prescence in USA and Europe.

Hope this was useful.

Thanks

Stuart

I've got 2 samples of fabric.  1 plain off white and the other a ribbed off
white.  Elizabeth and I prefer the ribbed.
Plain = $40 retail / $20 cost
Ribbed = $50 retail  / $25 cost x 34 yards = $850
I'll give them to you at cost so that we can continue furnishing your house
( I hear it's empty).
If you have time this afternoon and can walk down to your Lobby I can meet
you there to show you the fabrics.  Also, bring down a check so that I can
stop by Walter Lee Culp and order you couches and fabric ma?ana.  Fabric can
be overnighted if needed or sent 2 day.
I think 2 day is plenty of time.

50% now - (not including taxes)
50% later + shipping and taxes when couches are ready for delivery (6-8
wks.).

Need now
$5445 for 2 loveseats and 1 couch + $850 for fabric = $6295
I will give you a receipt.
Let me know when you can see the fabric........
Tina

   I'll
   find out paying conditions but usually is 50% upfront (cash) and then
   the
   other 50% when ready for delivery.  They don't take credit card.  Checks

   I'll get moving and call you on Friday.

Enron Taps $3 Billion From Bank Lines In Pre-Emptive Move to Ensure Liquidi=

Enron Corp. drew down about $3 billion, the bulk of its available bank cred=
it lines, in a bid to restore confidence in its financial strength and liqu=
idity.=20
Enron will use part of the money to offer to redeem about $1.85 billion of =
outstanding commercial paper -- short-term corporate IOUs -- according to a=
 person familiar with the matter, with the remainder providing the energy c=
oncern with a cash cushion. Some observers believe the move is a pre-emptiv=
e step by Enron to ensure that it had adequate liquidity should its access =
to bank lines be interrupted. The person also said Enron was talking to its=
 banks about a new, multibillion-dollar credit line.
Enron insists its business operation and financial condition remain strong.=
 But, "when the market is reacting as irrationally as it has been the last =
few days, we thought that cash was better than a commitment from a bank," s=
aid an Enron spokesman. In a statement, the company's new chief financial o=
fficer, Jeff McMahon, said that by drawing down the bank lines, "we are mak=
ing it clear that Enron has the support of its banks and more than adequate=
 liquidity to assure our customers that we can fulfill our commitments."=20
The move underscored the tumultuous conditions that have been sweeping over=
 the Houston energy-trading concern in the past 10 days. Enron is the natio=
n's largest energy trader and is a principal in nearly one-quarter of all e=
lectricity and natural-gas trades. Yesterday, for example, Enron was involv=
ed in about $4 billion of deals through its EnronOnline unit.=20
Since early last week, Enron's share price has plummeted 50%. Last week, it=
 reported a $618 million third-quarter loss and a reduction in shareholder =
equity of $1.2 billion. It also disclosed that the Securities and Exchange =
Commission is conducting an inquiry into billions of dollars of transaction=
s it did with entities connected to its former chief financial officer, And=
rew S. Fastow, who was replaced Wednesday.=20
The draw-down of the credit facilities came as one rating agency, Fitch, pu=
t Enron on review for a possible downgrade, while another, Standard & Poor'=
s, changed Enron's credit outlook to negative from stable. Moody's Investor=
s Service already has said it is looking at a possible downgrade of Enron. =
In order to fall below investment grade, Enron's credit rating would have t=
o fall several notches.=20
If that were to happen, however, a host of bad consequences could follow. T=
ogether with the sharp decline in its stock price, a noninvestment-grade ra=
ting would throw the company into default on obligations involving billions=
 of dollars of borrowings. In that event, Enron could be forced to issue mi=
llions of shares of stock to holders of that debt, diluting the value of ex=
isting shares. At 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enro=
n was down six cents at $16.35.=20
Liquidity is a key issue for Enron, which handles energy-trading volumes mo=
re than triple its next-biggest competitor, American Electric Power Co. Enr=
on's EnronOnline Internet-based trading platform has transacted more than $=
884 billion of trades since it was created in November 1999.=20
The company's wildly successful wholesale unit has been dragged down by und=
erperforming assets elsewhere in the company, chiefly the approximately $6.=
5 billion of international assets such as its Dabhol power project in India=
. Raising cash and retiring debt largely is a timing issue. The cash needs =
of its trading operation are immediate; it takes time to sell assets, parti=
cularly in today's slower economy.=20
The company also is suffering from a string of disclosure controversies tha=
t have damaged its credibility, particularly in connection with its dealing=
s with Mr. Fastow, the former chief financial officer. Internal documents r=
elated to one of the Fastow partnerships disclose that Enron also did as mu=
ch as hundreds of millions of dollars of business with an entity connected =
to another company official, who has since left Enron. While Enron disclose=
d its Fastow-related transactions in SEC filings, a computerized search of =
the SEC's database of public filings produced no reference to this other em=
ployee-related entity known as Chewco.=20
Chewco was established in 1997 "with approximately $400 million in capital =
commitments" to buy an interest in Enron assets, according to one of the pa=
rtnerships documents. The document didn't further specify what assets were =
purchased, and it didn't disclose the financial impact of the transactions =
for either Chewco or Enron. Chewco was being run by Michael Kopper, a manag=
ing director in Enron's Global Equity Markets Group, according to the docum=
ent.=20
Enron, which has maintained that its complex financial transactions with em=
ployee-related entities were legal and properly disclosed, didn't have any =
comment regarding its dealings with Chewco.=20
Mr. Kopper, who Enron says left the company this year to focus on helping t=
o run the Fastow-related partnerships, didn't return phone calls. A person =
at his office in Houston yesterday said Mr. Kopper was traveling. In respon=
se to questions about Chewco, an Enron spokesman would say only that "Micha=
el Kopper was never an executive officer of Enron." Mr. Fastow repeatedly h=
as declined interview requests. He severed his relationships with the partn=
erships in July.=20
This statement is an apparent reference to SEC disclosure regulations regar=
ding related-party transactions. Under SEC rule S-K, a company has to repor=
t any transaction that exceeds $60,000 and involves "any director or execut=
ive officer." By contrast, Mr. Fastow, as CFO, would have fallen into that =
category, but Mr. Kopper, as managing director of a business unit, presumab=
ly wouldn't have.=20
However, reporting guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Bo=
ard seems to have a broader definition, one that might include Mr. Kopper. =
According to FAS Statement 57, a related-party transaction involves a "mate=
rial" piece of business between the company and a member of management. The=
 statement defines management as directors, top officers, vice presidents i=
n charge of major business units and "other persons who perform similar pol=
icy-making functions. Persons without formal titles may also be members of =
management."

Deals & Deal Makers: Enron Officials Sell Shares Amid Stock-Price Slump

Officials at Enron Corp., whose unusual transactions with its chief financi=
al officer are under regulatory scrutiny, have steadily sold sizable amount=
s of their holdings of company stock as the share price has fallen this yea=
r.=20
Corporate officials had sold 1.8 million shares valued at about $106 millio=
n through July, as the stock fell to less than $45 a share from $83 at the =
start of the year. Since July, the stock has plummeted an additional 63% to=
 $16.35, including a 50% plunge since the beginning of last week.
Kenneth Lay, chief executive of the Houston energy-trading company, cashed =
in shares for $25.7 million so far this year, usually in transactions paire=
d with options exercises. He sold 429,614 shares, leaving him with some 2.8=
 million shares as of July, the latest data available on his sales, accordi=
ng to Thomson Financial/Lancer Analytics.=20
The dollar amount for his 2001 sales is approaching the total for all Mr. L=
ay's sales of Enron shares for 2000, which reached $30.7 million. In 1999, =
he sold shares for a total of $26 million.=20
In Houston, an Enron spokeswoman declined to comment on the figures, saying=
 the company doesn't keep a running tally of stockholdings by corporate off=
icials. Enron also wouldn't comment on the number of options held by compan=
y insiders and called the sales "a personal decision." Many sales by Enron =
insiders were concurrent with options exercises or sales followed soon afte=
r option exercises.=20
Strong selling by company officers and directors amid share-price declines =
should raise red flags for investors, says Jonathan Moreland, research dire=
ctor of InsiderInsights.com, who uses insider-trading data to zero in on in=
vestment ideas.=20
Among other insiders selling during the year, Kenneth Rice, former chairman=
 and CEO of Enron's broadband unit, sold shares for $23.7 million. Mr. Rice=
 has sold 456,966 shares of the 1.5 million shares he was listed as owning =
in Enron's March proxy filing. Former Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey Skillin=
g -- who resigned in August -- sold 160,000 shares for $9.8 million during =
the year. In March, Mr. Skilling owned 1.9 million shares.=20
Messrs. Rice and Skilling couldn't be reached to comment.=20
Overall, Enron's insiders were busier selling shares last year, when they s=
old 5.8 million shares for about $449 million. During 1999, insiders sold 3=
.4 million shares for $123.1 million.=20
Since December 1999, only one Enron executive has reported buying company s=
hares. The buyer was Andrew Fastow, who was ousted during the week as Enron=
's chief financial officer after the company disclosed it was under a Secur=
ities and Exchange Commission investigation into financial ties between the=
 company and Mr. Fastow.=20
Mr. Fastow reported purchasing 10,000 Enron shares in August at $36.98 each=
, or a total of $369,800. Today, those shares are valued at $163,500, based=
 on Enron's stock price of $16.35 in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composi=
te trading. After the purchase, Mr. Fastow owned 110,586 shares, Thomson Fi=
nancial/Lancer Analytics says.=20
Enron said Mr. Fastow wasn't available to comment.=20
On Monday, a New York law firm filed suit in U.S. District Court in Houston=
, alleging that Enron misrepresented its performance by failing to disclose=
 problems with its broadband division and failing to properly write down th=
e value of investments in limited partnerships managed by Mr. Fastow. The s=
uit, which seeks class-action status, also says Enron insiders sold $73 mil=
lion of their own Enron holdings during parts of 2000 and 2001.

Enron's Financial Troubles Reverberate to Bonds With Poor Liquidity and Cre=
dit-Rating Concerns

NEW YORK -- Enron Corp.'s bonds have held up better than its battered stock=
 amid escalating financial woes at the energy-trading powerhouse.=20
Not for long, some bond traders say.
In trading yesterday, the Houston company's five-year bond, a $250 million =
issue due in July 2006 carrying a coupon of 6.4%, was quoted at 82 cents on=
 the dollar, down from a bid of 88 late Wednesday, and representing a 16% d=
rop during the past two weeks.=20
That is far less than the 50% decline in Enron's stock price since the Oct.=
 16 disclosure of a $1.01 billion charge linked to soured investments, resu=
lting in a $618 million third-quarter loss. But the fall in the bond's pric=
e translates to a yield of 7.7 percentage points above bellwether U.S. gove=
rnment bonds, which is a widening from about three percentage points two we=
eks ago. Although Enron still is an investment-grade credit, that kind of "=
spread" is more characteristic of a junk bond with a credit rating of singl=
e B or lower.=20
Enron sought to assure the markets that its finances were sound, disclosing=
 late yesterday that it drew down more than $1 billion on its bank credit l=
ines to shore up its finances. Yet even as Enron was tapping its lifeline, =
investors were finding it difficult to trade big blocks of Enron bonds. Yes=
terday's 82 bid, for instance, was for a block of less than $2 million in b=
onds, a small percentage of a typical trade.=20
Fueling the uncertainty surrounding Enron were fears that credit-rating con=
cerns will lower ratings on Enron debt after it recently conceded a slew of=
 troubles, including losses, a Securities and Exchange Commission investiga=
tion, and the sudden resignation of its chief financial officer.=20
"Even at these levels, there's very little buying interest," said Harold Ri=
vkin, a principal at distressed-debt trader H. Rivkin & Co. in Princeton, N=
.J.=20
In one sign of the ripple effects, the price investors pay to protect thems=
elves from losses on Enron debt was surging. The cost of a "default swap" -=
- in which an investor pays another investor to take a chunk of debt at fac=
e value in the event of default -- rose to 10% of the size of the credit be=
ing insured. That was up from 8% a day earlier, and more than holders of Lu=
cent Technologies Inc. debt had to pay at the height of that technology com=
pany's troubles earlier during the year.=20
Even with its woes, Enron remains an investment-grade company. Most credit-=
rating agencies rate Enron's senior unsecured debt at several notches above=
 the noninvestment-grade level.=20
Yet Fitch said yesterday it put Enron's credit rating on watch for a possib=
le downgrade, following a similar move by Moody's Investors Service last we=
ek. (Standard & Poor's, a division of McGraw Hill Cos., stopped short of pu=
tting the company on its Creditwatch list, opting instead to revise its lon=
g-term ratings outlook to "negative," citing concerns about the company's f=
inancial flexibility.)=20
Meanwhile, the weak bond prices are a sign that the markets are bracing for=
 the worst. "These are investment-grade bonds that are migrating toward dis=
tressed levels," said Glenn Reynolds, an analyst at Credit Sights Inc., an =
independent fixed-income research firm in New York. "They aren't distressed=
 yet, but they are headed in that direction."=20
If Enron's credit ratings fall, it would have implications far beyond the c=
ompany's ability to raise money. For an energy trader, a credit downgrade s=
ends a signal to other participants in crucial markets about its ability to=
 make good on its commitments.=20
Enron makes markets in a variety of commodities. Though it is best known fo=
r trading electricity and natural gas, the company also is a huge force in =
the markets for other commodities such as lumber, metals, bandwidth capacit=

bout a quarter of all the trading in the nation's energy and gas markets.=
=20
Enron's credit-worthiness is hugely important. The better its credit rating=
, the cheaper it can hedge, or offset, its positions in all these commoditi=
es markets through derivatives and pass on savings to customers. Without th=

 to rise. A derivative is an instrument whose value is linked to, or derive=

ommodity.=20
"Even if the company does retain its investment-grade rating, the perceptio=
n that this might be at risk will start to affect their core businesses," s=
aid Mr. Reynolds at Credit Sights Inc. "Any prudent risk [manager] at Enron=
's counterparties" -- any institution on the other end of a financial agree=
ment with Enron -- "is going to be examining their exposure to Enron, and l=
ooking for ways to minimize it or offset it," Mr. Reynolds said.=20
To be sure, Enron, despite its recent woes, remains a strong company, credi=
t analysts said. "I don't think anyone's seriously thinking that this is a =
company that would ever default," Mr. Reynolds said.=20
"So far, our research shows that their counterparties and their banks are s=
ticking with them," said Ron Barone, managing director of Standard & Poor's=
 utility energy project finance group. "No one has cut credit lines or aske=

Heard on the Street
Most Analysts Remain Plugged In to Enron
By Susanne Craig and Jonathan Weil
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

10/26/2001
The Wall Street Journal
C1
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Enron: Rarely have so many analysts liked a stock they concede they know so=
 little about.=20
In recent years, Wall Street researchers have been overwhelmingly -- critic=
s would say blindly -- enthusiastic about Enron, even as they acknowledge n=
ot always understanding the complex financial transactions that accounted f=
or its soaring profits. Now, Enron is reporting steep losses from some of i=
ts most complicated transactions, which many on Wall Street still can't fig=
ure out.
In a research note Wednesday, Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer concede=
d that scant corporate disclosure at the Houston energy trader makes it dif=
ficult to value the company. The company's "lack of disclosure and transpar=
ency," he says, is "a longstanding Enron hallmark."=20
So is this a stock to avoid, in his view? Hardly. Goldman on Wednesday did =
bump Enron off its "U.S. Select List," which consists of a few dozen top st=
ock picks -- but Mr. Fleischer continued to keep the stock on the firm's la=
rger but prestigious "Recommended List" of 200 or so favored stocks, where =
it has been since he joined Goldman in 1993.=20
"Just because I can't be specific in being able to create a simple model . =
. . doesn't mean that you write off that industry and say `I can't analyze =
it' or `I can't figure it out,' " says Mr. Fleischer, who owns an undisclos=
ed number of Enron shares. "If that were the case, there would be an awful =
lot of industries we couldn't follow."=20
Enron's shares have dropped about 50% since last week.=20
"Every sell-side analyst we spoke to early in 2001 admitted that this was a=
 black box," says Jim Chanos, principal of Kynikos Associates in New York, =
who has been selling Enron stock short -- trading it with an eye to profiti=
ng from its fall -- throughout this year. "It was really a trust-me story, =
when all the evidence was mounting that there was reason to question that l=
evel of trust."=20
True, no stock picker is immune from bad calls. And Wall Street analysts lo=
ng have been criticized for their overwhelmingly bullish bias, particularly=
 on stocks in hot sectors with lots of investment-banking deals to be had.=
=20
But Enron stands apart, precisely because so many of the analysts still rec=
ommending the stock have acknowledged that the company's disclosure practic=
es are lacking. Which raises the question: How can an analyst recommend tha=
t others purchase a stock when key information about the company's operatio=
ns is so often either unavailable or indecipherable?=20
Concerns about the way that Enron runs its business aren't new. Many of the=
 issues now plaguing Enron's stock were first raised more than a year ago b=
y bearish hedge-fund managers and independent accounting experts. Yet time =
and again, Wall Street analysts dismissed as unimportant many of the linger=
ing questions about the company's various partnership transactions.=20
Besides those partnerships, Enron also has been dogged by concerns about th=
e secretive valuation techniques it uses to record its assets and earnings.=
=20
Through it all, most analysts have stuck by this onetime stock-market darli=
ng, publicly dismissing questions about the firm's accounting practices and=
 level of disclosure. As of yesterday, of the 17 analysts who following the=
 stock, 10 had a "strong buy" or equivalent rating on the stock, according =
to Thomson Financial/First Call. Five others rated the stock a "buy," thoug=
h not strongly.=20
Only Prudential Securities, which downgraded the stock this week, has a "se=
ll" rating on Enron.=20
The bullish treatment is the latest and one of the most high-profile exampl=
es of Wall Street taking a glass half-full stance, despite what in retrospe=
ct seems to be ample warning that a less-enthusiastic approach was warrante=
d.=20
Over the past year in the wake of the Nasdaq Composite Index's general coll=
apse, analysts have been widely assailed for a lack of independence -- part=
icularly those who, like Goldman's Mr. Fleischer, own shares in the compani=
es they cover. Regulators have raised concerns that analysts have compromis=
ed themselves to help their firms land lucrative investment-banking fees an=
d other revenue.=20
Enron has spread the wealth across many Wall Street firms. For instance, fo=
r one $865 million equity offering in 1999 led by `Credit Suisse First Bost=
on, Enron retained seven co-managers, including Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette=
, Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch.=20
"Enron is a big company, and I don't think you're going to find a firm that=
 hasn't been involved," says Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Curt Launer=
, who still rates the stock a "strong buy" with a $40 price target. "They p=
ay a lot of investment-banking fees to Wall Street."=20
He adds, "We do our analysis every day based on the information we have. Ar=
e we here strictly to defend companies? That's ludicrous. We're here to pro=
vide information to investors. . . . Yes, I have the wrong recommendation o=
n the stock. I don't think my analysis has been as wrong as the stock has p=
erformed."=20
Mr. Fleischer, whose firm also has served as an investment banker to Enron,=
 calls his holding "a meaningful investment" that is "not small." But he di=
sputes any suggestion that his objectivity is compromised. Mr. Fleischer sa=
ys his clients "are happy to know" he has a stake in Enron, because it show=
s he puts his money where his mouth is.=20
In his research note Wednesday, Mr. Fleischer called for complete disclosur=
es of Enron's off-balance sheet partnerships. Despite the resulting difficu=
lty he acknowledged facing in developing financial models for the company, =
he wrote that he and many other investors historically "have given Enron th=
e benefit of doubt because of its strong growth in earnings" and position a=
s an industry leader.=20
"There's not information to really model this and be able to predict accura=
tely where revenues are going to come from and where they're going to make =
their money, but every quarter they do," he says. "It's hard to get inside =
to know all the transactions, but they do deliver."=20
CSFB's Mr. Launer also has been a longtime defender of the company, occasio=
nally issuing research reports to rebut critical stories about Enron in the=
 financial press. On Monday, he wrote that he expects questions about Enron=
's partnerships and accounting disclosures to continue, but that he remains=
 "confident in the businesses and operating growth prospects for [Enron] an=
d an ultimate recovery in the share price."=20
"I know I'm wrong on the stock," Mr. Launer says. But he says that at these=
 prices, he isn't ready to throw in the towel because he figures that even =
in a worst-case scenario -- under which he envisions Enron having to issue =
as much as $2 billion worth of shares, diluting current holders -- the stoc=
k doesn't have much further to fall.=20
Clearly, Messrs. Launer and Flesicher aren't alone. "Even in relative terms=
, analysts remain very bullish on this stock," says Chuck Hill, director of=
 research at Thomson Financial/First Call. The average rating for a stock o=
n Wall Street is 2.2, or slightly shy of a "buy" rating. Enron scores a 1.6=
. "This may turn into a classic case of locking the barn door after the bad=
 news is out," Mr. Hill says.=20
In downgrading the stock this week, Prudential analyst Carol Coale bumped i=
t to "sell" from "buy," with a brief stop at "hold." While she is the only =
analyst to recommend investors sell the stock, she openly concedes her rece=
nt downgrades come "too little, too late."=20
Ms. Coale says Enron has been difficult to cover for years. She says the co=
mpany's disclosure practices fall far short of ideal, and senior executives=
 are often evasive, even when presented with direct questions. For instance=
, she says three weeks ago she asked Enron management if the company was un=
der investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. They said "no,=
" she says.=20
In light of the company's acknowledgment this week of an SEC "inquiry," she=
 asked Enron about the previous denial. "They told me it is an inquiry, not=
 an investigation," she says. An Enron spokeswoman says the company learned=
 of the SEC's inquiry only last Wednesday.

Enron Draws Down $3 Bln in Credit to Boost Investor Confidence

Enron Draws Down $3 Bln in Credit to Boost Investor Confidence

     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., whose stock has
fallen on concern about the largest energy trader's transactions
with affiliates, drew down $3 billion in credit to restore
confidence in its financial strength.

     The Houston-based company will use about $2.2 billion to pay
off commercial paper obligations and keep the rest as cash,
spokesman Mark Palmer said.

     ``Nothing instils confidence like cash,'' he said.

     Enron's shares have dropped 52 percent in the past 10 days as
investors worry that the company's credit rating will be cut after
$1.01 billion in third-quarter losses from failed investments.
Enron needs good credit to raise cash daily to keep trading
partners from demanding collateral and to settle transactions.

     Investors say they are worried about $3.3 billion in
liabilities from affiliates formed to buy and sell Enron assets.
Enron ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow on Wednesday
amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into
partnerships he ran that cost the company $35 million.

     Jeff McMahon, head of Enron's industrial markets group, was
named CFO in a bid to restore investor confidence, Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay said in a statement.

     Enron shares fell 6 cents to $16.35 yesterday.

Enron Liked By Analysts Despite Complicated Dealings, WSJ Says
2001-10-26 06:12 (New York)

     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. is liked by many
Wall Street analysts despite lingering questions about the power
trading company's complicated partnership transactions and the
techniques used to record earnings, the Wall Street Journal
reported in its ``Heard on the Street'' column.

     Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analyst David Fleischer, who owns an
undisclosed number of Enron shares, said that even though
inadequate corporate disclosure makes it difficult to value the
company, that doesn't mean he will write off the industry or not
analyze Enron.

     Of the 17 analysts who follow the stock, 10 had a ``strong
buy'' or equivalent rating, according to Thomson Financial/First
Call, the paper said. Five rated it ``buy'' and one had a ``sell''
on Enron.

     Most analysts have stuck by the company, publicly dismissing
questions about Enron's accounting practices and level of
disclosure, the Journal said.

     The Securities and Exchange Commission is inquiring about
partnerships run by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow.


Enron Draws Down $3 Billion From Its Credit Lines, WSJ Reports
2001-10-26 00:28 (New York)

     New York, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. drew down about
$3 billion of its available credit, the bulk of its bank credit
lines, to restore confidence in the financial strength of the
company, the Wall Street Journal reported.

     The energy trading company, whose shares have fallen 52
percent since Oct. 16, will use part of the money to redeem about
$1.85 billion short-term commercial debt, the Wall Street Journal
reported, citing an unidentified person familiar with the matter.

     Enron is talking to banks about a new, multi-billion line of
credit, the paper reported, citing the unidentified person. The
steps are seen as an effort by the energy trader to ensure that it
has adequate liquidity in case its access to bank credit is
disrupted, the paper said.

     Enron said in a statement distributed by PR Newswire that it
drew on its credit lines to provide more than $1 billion in cash
liquidity. The steps come a day after Chief Financial Officer
Andrew Fastow resigned amid a Securities and Exchange Commission
probe of partnerships he ran.

Earlier Thursday, two credit rating agencies took actions regarding Enron's=

Before the market closed, international credit-rating agency Fitch put Enro=

Corporate US on track for bailout
DAVID GOW IN NEW YORK

Battered corporate America will receive an immediate Dollars 25bn (pounds 1=
8bn) tax rebate under a Dollars 100bn eocnomic stimulation package just app=
roved by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.=20
The controversial package, worth an estimated Dollars 212bn over three year=
s, includes Dollars 70bn for companies next year alone. It was approved by =
the House late on Wednesday by 216 votes to 214, but faces significant amen=
dment in the Senate, which is now under Democrat control.
It has reopened a wide ideological rift between Republicans, who favour cor=
porate and individual tax cuts to reboot an economy mired in recession, and=
 Democrats - who, in a reprise of the Roosevelt "new deal", prefer to see i=
ncreased public spending on unemployment and infrastructure projects.=20
Liberal lobby groups such as the Citizens for Tax Justice and the Center on=
 Budget and Policy Priorities claim the bill would hand back Dollars 6.3bn =
to the 14 biggest corporations - which, they say, are renowned for paying l=
ittle or no tax.=20
The most hotly contested measure is the repeal of the corporate alternative=
 minimum tax, or AMT, introduced in 1986 to make sure firms could not avoid=
 all tax payments. This, strongly supported by President Bush, would be mad=
e retroactive so that all AMT payments would be refunded.=20
The lobby groups and the non-partisan Congressional Research Service calcul=
ate that this would give a Dollars 1.4bn boost to computer group IBM alone,=
 while General Motors would get back Dollars 833m and General Electric Doll=
ars 671m.=20
Others to benefit include TXU, the Texas-based utility that is the US's thi=
rd largest energy supplier, which would would be given Dollars 608m. United=
 Airlines, the US's second largest carrier - which is warning of bankruptcy=
 - would receive Dollars 371m, and Enron, the energy trading group forced t=
o sack its finance director this week, would be given Dollars 254m.=20
Democrat leaders in the Senate are determined to erase this measure and dis=
like other proposals to boost firms, which include a 30% tax break for capi=
tal investment over three years worth Dollars 39.3bn this year alone. They =
say these amount to a "giant corporate giveaway".=20
Mr Bush and other Republican leaders argue these fiscal concessions would h=
elp companies making hundreds of thousands redundant avoid further lay-offs=
 and invest more, prompting an economic recovery that, at best, is likely t=
o start in the new year.=20
"Businesses are America's employers. They're the hardware store, the diner =
down the street, the gas station on the corner. They're not the enemy of wo=
rking families," the author of the plan, Representative Bill Thomas of Cali=
fornia, said.=20
Democrats are especially incensed with the alleged paucity of the package's=
 provisions for the growing numbers of jobless, arguing that much of the Do=
llars 12bn foreseen would not go to individuals but into the reserves of st=
ates.=20

Harvey Pitt's S.E.C.: From Guard Dog to Friendly Puppy?
By FLOYD NORRIS

10/26/2001
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company

CAN the new, friendlier Securities and Exchange Commission enforce the laws=
 and assure investors that corporate financial reports are trustworthy?=20
Harvey L. Pitt, the new S.E.C. chairman, set out this week to show that he =
is not like his predecessor, Arthur Levitt. In a speech to the American Ins=
titute of Certified Public Accountants -- an organization whose senior lead=
ership led a bitter and ultimately unsuccessful fight against Mr. Levitt's =
reform efforts -- Mr. Pitt praised his listeners and took a few swipes at h=
is predecessor.=20
>From now on, he promised, ''the commission will make sound decisions, in a =
respectful, affirmative way, not in a demeaning, demanding or demonizing wa=
y.'' He spoke favorably of ''pro forma'' earnings reports, in ways that no =
doubt heartened accountants who have worked so hard to find ways to make ev=
en the worst profit figures look pretty. There was no mention of Mr. Levitt=
's concerns about improper management of earnings.
On the heels of Mr. Pitt's speech, the S.E.C. used a minor enforcement acti=
on to herald a policy of not cracking down on companies that come forward t=
o report their own errors. The decision itself was reasonable, although one=
 could wonder if top management did something wrong in failing to detect a =
fraud that went on for years. But the way the S.E.C. trumpeted it raised qu=
estions about whether the agency is turning into a friendly puppy rather th=
an a guard dog. ''Is this amnesty for financial fraud?'' Jane Adams, the ac=
counting analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston and a former S.E.C. staff me=
mber, asked in a report to clients. She was not sure of the answer.=20
In an interview yesterday, Mr. Pitt dismissed such worries. ''No one is goi=
ng to get away with anything,'' he said. ''What we are trying to do is crea=
te an environment where people feel comfortable'' and can talk to the S.E.C=
. ''without feeling we are looking for a big splash.''=20
A major embarrassment for accountants is having the S.E.C. force a client t=
o restate its numbers. Mr. Pitt and his chief accountant, Robert Herdman, a=
re sending signals that fewer such demands will be made. ''I am very much i=
n favor of a vigorous enforcement program,'' Mr. Pitt said in the interview=
, ''but I am not in favor of having investors barraged by conflicting state=
ments and restatements.''=20
Mr. Pitt talks of companies ''getting it right the first time,'' which woul=
d certainly be nice. But there is a risk that companies will become more ag=
gressive in their accounting, figuring there will be no real penalty, like =
a restatement, if they are caught. That would make life harder for auditors=
 who try to resist misleading accounting.=20
In trying to sound comforting to the accountants' group -- an organization =
that, as he noted, he had represented as a lawyer for two decades -- Mr. Pi=
tt has done little to reassure investors of his independence.=20
The proof, of course, will come in the performance. Fortunately, the mess a=
t Enron gives the S.E.C. a golden opportunity to counter the puppy image. I=
t will take time for the commission to determine if the company's accountin=
g was proper. But there need be no delay in forcing Enron to clearly explai=
n -- rather than obfuscate as it has so far -- the strange deals it made wi=
th partnerships run by the executive just ousted as chief financial officer=
.=20
''This could,'' a former S.E.C. staff member said, ''focus the issue on whe=
ther companies can make completely correct but totally misleading disclosur=
es.'' And it would indicate that this watchdog still has a bite.

The Five Dumbest Things on Wall Street This Week
By K.C. Swanson <mailto:kcswanson@thestreet.com>
Staff Reporter

TheStreet.com
1. United Airlines Just a Little Too Honest
Rule No. 1 in CEO school: Never say that your company may soon collapse.=20
Seems kind of obvious, but that rule was flouted by United Airlines chief J=
ames Goodwin, who warned in a letter to employees that the company "will pe=
rish" next year unless it can stanch its tremendous losses, which have wors=
ened since the terrorist attacks. "Today, we are literally hemorrhaging mon=
ey," he wrote.=20
In raising concerns about the financial viability of United, a unit of UAL =
(UAL:NYSE - news - commentary) , Goodwin only put into words what outsiders=
 have speculated about. Since Sept. 11, the airline has laid off about 20,0=
00 of its 100,000 employees and cut flights by as much as 25%. It's expecte=
d to announce massive losses when it reports third-quarter earnings.=20
But in response to the disclosure, Goodwin has been roundly attacked. Feeli=
ng that he had been all too honest, investors have knocked an additional 24=
% off the stock's value. The shares are down 54% since Sept 11. Meanwhile, =
UAL union leaders reportedly say Goodwin has exaggerated company difficulti=
es to gain bargaining leverage in union negotiations. The leaders of one un=
ion have petitioned the company's board of directors to have him sacked.=20
Bottom line: CEOs may get pilloried when they try to dodge the truth, but s=
ometimes it doesn't pay to be too candid about worst-case scenarios, either=
. Especially when that scenario is the company's own demise.=20
2. Forget the Victory Gardens; Let's Have a Comfortable War=20
Sure, we're at war with a band of cave-dwelling outlaws hell bent on our an=
nihilation. But would all freedom-loving Americans please go out and buy so=
me DVD players? Maybe even a nice new car?=20
That was basically the message from the Treasury Department, on news that C=
ongress had voted for the creation of war bonds to finance antiterrorism ef=
forts and rebuilding following the attacks. Officials at Treasury applauded=
 the sentiment, then politely suggested it would be even better for the eco=
nomy if Americans just went to stores and bought stuff. "The economy is per=
haps our greatest asset as we move forward in these efforts to fight the wa=
r on global terrorists," says Betsy Holahan, a department spokesperson. "Wa=
r bonds are an additional way for Americans to show their patriotism."=20
For the record, we don't think an issue of war bonds would be dumb, just su=
perfluous. After all, nothing's stopped Americans from buying generic savin=
gs bonds -- or better yet, Treasuries -- all of which finance spending by t=
he federal government.=20
In the meantime, it's a little dislocating to hear politicians talk up war =
bonds -- which most people associate with hardship and sacrifice -- at the =
same time top economic gurus are practically begging people to shop. War bo=
nds notwithstanding, we're a long way off from the era of ration books.=20
3. Enron Again
Last week, we noted the extent of alarm about Enron's (ENE:NYSE - news - co=
mmentary) revelation that its shareholder equity had dropped $1.2 billion, =
following some unusual and possibly inappropriate high-level transactions. =
Following that disclosure, besieged CFO Andrew Fastow has finally left the =
company on what's delicately termed a "leave of absence."=20
In July, Fastow exited a limited partnership, from which he had reportedly =
reaped large profits, after shareholders and analysts objected to his invol=
vement. Concerns about those dealings and others had increased in the wake =
of the disclosure about the charge to equity until even management acknowle=
dged Fastow would have to go as a prerequisite to restoring investor confid=
ence.=20
But that won't be an easy task, given the resentment about Enron's disincli=
nation to explain its problems. One analyst called Fastow's departure "unse=
ttling," noting that management had given the CFO its endorsement only the =
day before. Sounding a note of exasperation, analysts at J.P. Morgan Chase,=
 Banc of America Securities and Prudential all downgraded the stock. And th=
ere could be more trouble to come: The Securities and Exchange Commission h=
as issued Enron a letter of inquiry related to some of its transactions.=20
4. Gold Diggers=20
It's understandable that investors felt panicky in September. Unfortunately=
, some reacted by shoving their hard-earned money into gold funds. Accordin=
g to Financial Research Corp., which tracks fund flows, the specialty preci=
ous-metals category was the best-selling equity category during September, =
with net inflows of $101 million.=20
Granted, that's not a huge sum in the mutual fund world. By comparison, dur=
ing the same month, large growth funds saw net redemptions of $7.4 billion.=
 But the fact that so many people are jumping into precious metals is notew=
orthy, given that gold funds have performed so badly for so long.=20
Sure, under the bizarre circumstances of late, they've enjoyed somewhat of =
a pop. According to Morningstar, the average precious-metals fund is up 10.=
08% year to date. But over the past five years, the same category lost an e=
mbarrassing 14.68%. By comparison, even large-cap growth funds -- everybody=
's favorite whipping boy -- managed to post a positive return. In the same =
period, they were up 7.13%.=20
Moreover, circumstances that would seem to be the most favorable in decades=
 -- a combination of attacks on the U.S. government and war -- still don't =
seem to have boosted gold prices significantly. Despite an initial surge in=
 prices after the terrorist attacks, they're again approaching their pre-Se=
pt. 11 levels. It's too early to say, but it's likely the gold bugs will co=
nfront disappointment once again.=20
5. Amazon Amazes Once Again
Amazon (AMZN:Nasdaq - news - commentary) still maintains it will become pro=
fitable by the fourth quarter. Well, at least it will post a pro forma oper=
ating profit.=20
OK, so maybe that wouldn't include Amazon's service on $2.17 billion in lon=
g-term debt or extraordinary charges. In fact, a pro forma operating profit=
 is basically just an accounting concept that would lend a fuzzy, meaningle=
ss aura of minor triumph. The company still hasn't said when it will turn a=
n economic profit.=20
For that matter, even the fourth-quarter prediction is iffy. After announci=
ng the company expected to turn the pro forma operating profit, CFO Warren =
Jenson added the humble qualifier, "There are no guarantees." Amazon simult=
aneously lowered its forecast for fourth-quarter revenue, predicting that s=
ales would be somewhere between flat and up by 10% compared with a year ago=
.=20
Third-quarter trends weren't encouraging. Though sales overall were up slig=
htly in the third quarter from a year ago, revenue from the company's core =
books and music business actually fell 12%. At least the company has made p=
rogress in cutting costs: A spokesperson says pro forma operating expenses =
have decreased by 20% over the past year.=20
Incidentally, in the wake of Amazon's earnings report, two analysts made th=
e belated decision to cut their ratings on the stock, which has fallen 93% =
from its high back in December 1999. Merrill Lynch analyst Henry Blodget an=
d SG Cowen analyst Scott Reamer downgraded the stock to "neutral" from prev=
ious buy ratings. "We thought there might be upside to our estimates," note=
d Blodget. "There wasn't."=20

NEW YORK, Oct. 25 -- Selected buying of technology and energy shares pulled=
 the stock market higher today, reversing a morning slide triggered by a pa=
ir of grim economic reports.=20
Shares of semiconductor makers and equipment manufacturers did particularly=
 well, as did energy traders, led by a surprisingly strong performance from=
 Williams Cos., a Tulsa-based energy firm that had an 83 percent jump in th=
ird-quarter net earnings.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed rose at 9448.78, up 103.16, reversi=
ng an earlier deficit of 167 points. The Nasdaq composite index rose 36.29,=
 to 1767.83, and the Standard & Poor's 500 index was rose 12.79, to 1097.99=
.=20
Earlier, a pair of dismal economic reports had compounded worries about the=
 fallout from last month's terrorist attacks to send stocks lower. As in re=
cent sessions, however, investors absorbed the bad news and focused on good=
 news regarding individual companies.=20
Williams Cos. surpassed analysts' estimates for the third quarter and raise=
d its forecasts for full-year earnings for 2001 and 2002. Investors rewarde=
d the company by driving its shares up $1.42, to $27.32, bringing several o=
ther parts of the energy sector along with it.=20
Even the shares of Enron rose, a day after the embattled company dismissed =
its chief financial officer and replaced him with an another executive from=
 within the company. Enron rose 28 cents, to $16.69.=20
Semiconductor shares also rebounded, led by industry bellwether Intel, up 4=
4 cents at $25.92, and Applied Materials, up $1.35 at 36.69. Leading data-s=
torage maker EMC rose $1.06, to $13.54.=20
Traders said the Senate's passage this afternoon of an anti-terrorism measu=
re also helped lift investor sentiment. Late Wednesday, the House passed a =
$100 billion economic stimulus package to combat the effects of the terrori=
st attacks on the economy.=20
A surprisingly large drop in orders for durable goods had weighed heavily o=
n the market in the morning, as did poor earnings results from American Int=
ernational Group and WorldCom.=20
The Commerce Department reported orders plunged in September for the fourth=
 consecutive month. The 8.5 percent decline was far worse than the 1.3 perc=
ent dip many analysts had forecast.=20
The Labor Department also reported that the number of newly laid-off Americ=
ans filing for unemployment benefits rose by 8,000 last week, to 504,000, t=
he second-highest figure in nearly a decade and a level that is generally a=
ssociated with recessions.=20
Other Indicators=20
* The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 5.88, to 562.96; the Ame=
rican Stock Exchange index rose 5.10, to 828.67; and the Russell index of 2=

* Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by 9 to 7 on the NYSE, where =
trading volume rose to 1.38 billion shares, from 1.35 billion on Wednesday.=
 On the Nasdaq, advancers outnumbered decliners by more than 3 to 2 and vol=
ume totaled 2.2 billion, up from 1.84 billion.=20
* The price of the Treasury's 10-year note rose $4.38 per $1,000 invested, =
and its yield fell to 4.54 percent, from 4.59 percent late Wednesday.=20
* The dollar rose against the Japanese yen and the euro. In late New York t=
rading, a dollar bought 122.87 yen, up from 122.76 yen late Wednesday, and =
a euro bought 89.25 cents, down from 89.42 cents.=20
* Light, sweet crude oil for December delivery settled at $22.01 a barrel, =
up 32 cents, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.=20

Enron Taps $3 Billion From Bank Lines in Pre-Emptive Move to Ensure Liquidi=

10/25/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Embattled Enron Corp. drew down about $3 billion, the bulk of its available=
 bank credit lines, in a bid to restore confidence in its financial strengt=
h and liquidity, Friday's Wall Street Journal reported.=20
Enron (ENE) will use part of the money to offer to redeem around $1.85 bill=
ion in outstanding commercial paper -- short-term corporate IOUs -- accordi=
ng to a person familiar with the matter, with the remainder used to provide=
 a cash cushion. This person also said that Enron was talking to its banks =
about a new multibillion-dollar credit line. Some observers thought the mov=
es were a pre-emptive step by Enron to ensure that it had adequate liquidit=
y should its access to bank lines be interrupted.
Enron insists its business operation and financial condition remain strong.=
 But "when the market is reacting as irrationally as it has been the last f=
ew days, we thought that cash was better than a commitment from a bank," sa=
id an Enron spokesman. In a prepared statement, the company's new chief fin=
ancial officer, Jeff McMahon, said that by drawing down the bank lines, "we=
 are making it clear that Enron has the support of its banks and more than =
adequate liquidity to assure our customers that we can fulfill our commitme=
nts."=20
The move underscored the tumultuous conditions that have been sweeping over=
 the Houston energy-trading firm in the past 10 days. Enron is the nation's=
 largest energy trader and is a principal in nearly one-quarter of all elec=
tricity and natural-gas trades. Thursday, for example, Enron was involved i=
n about $4 billion worth of deals through its EnronOnline unit.=20
Since early last week, Enron's share price has plummeted 50%. It has report=
ed a $618 million third-quarter loss and a reduction in shareholder equity =
of $1.2 billion. It also disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commiss=
ion is conducting an inquiry into billions of dollars of transactions it di=
d with entities run by its former chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow=
, who was replaced Wednesday.=20
The draw-down of the credit facilities came as a major rating agency, Fitch=
, put Enron on review for a possible downgrade while Standard & Poors chang=
ed Enron's credit outlook to negative from stable. Moody's Investors Servic=
e has already said it is looking at a possible downgrade. In order to fall =
below investment grade, Enron's credit rating would have to fall several no=
tches.=20
If that were to happen, however, a host of bad consequences could follow. T=
ogether with the sharp decline in its stock price, a noninvestment grade ra=
ting would throw the company into default on obligations involving billions=
 of dollars of borrowings. In that event, Enron could be forced to issue mi=
llions of shares of stock to holders of that debt, diluting the value of ex=
isting shares. As of 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, E=
nron shares were down six cents at $16.35.=20

As Enron's woes unnerve investors about energy sector, analysts say its pro=
blems are isolated

NEW YORK (AP) - As it grew over the past decade into the country's largest =
natural gas and power marketing company, Enron Corp. became the de facto ba=
rometer of health within the energy trading sector.=20
Wall Street buoyed the stock prices of Enron's competitors based in part on=
 the huge success of the Houston-based company's business model. Now, execu=
tives and industry analysts hope to prevent Enron's internal tumult and fre=
e-falling stock price from undermining investors' confidence in the sector.=
 They say the Houston-based company's problems should be viewed in isolatio=
n and not as a broader indicator of the marketplace.
"The marketplace for natural gas and power trading is as vibrant as it was =
yesterday, a week ago or a month ago," said Jim Donnell, president of Duke =
Energy North America, a division of Duke Energy Corp. that generates and tr=
ades power.=20
That opinion appeared to gain acceptance on Thursday as shares of Dynegy In=
c., El Paso Corp. and Duke Energy Corp. rebounded from losses on Wednesday,=
 when Enron's latest woes appeared to spill over into the stock prices of i=
ts rivals.=20
Enron's stock has fallen about 50 percent in the past week (and nearly 80 p=
ercent since January) and analysts said its recovery is not expected anytim=
e soon.=20
The latest troubles began Oct. 16 when Enron reported third quarter earning=
s, and a longtime concern among Wall Street analysts that executives were n=
ot entirely forthcoming only got worse.=20
First came reports that some of the company's losses stemmed from partnersh=
ips managed by Enron's chief financial officer at the time, Andrew Fastow. =
That raised concerns about a potential conflict of interest and touched off=
 an inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission.=20
Then on Wednesday, one day after Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay defended Fastow=
, the company ousted him and said he would take a leave of absence.=20
"They created an environment in which their credibility was put to the test=
 and they didn't come through with flying colors," said Christopher Ellingh=
aus, an analyst at Williams Capital Group in New York.=20
Enron shares have been falling all year for reasons new and old, which have=
 little to do with the company's wholesale energy business, which accounts =
for roughly 80 percent of profits.=20
Analysts insist wholesale energy marketing can be profitable even in the fa=
ce of an economic downturn and falling natural gas and electricity prices.=
=20
"Even though (Enron) shot themselves in the foot, the basic business is sti=
ll sound and not likely to disappear," Ellinghaus said.=20
UBS Warburg analyst Ronald Barone echoed that sentiment.=20
"The collateral damage to the rest of the space - Dynegy and El Paso - is o=
verdone," Barone said.=20
On Thursday, Williams Companies Inc. of Tulsa, Okla., reported net income o=
f $760 million and Reliant Resources Inc. of Houston reported $133 million =
in profits.=20
"It's business as usual," said Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel.=20
Not for Enron, whose stock price began a steady descent 10 months ago when =
its nascent high-speed Internet unit failed to live up to the hype. The dow=
nward momentum was further propelled by difficulties collecting money from =
power customers in India and the surprise departure in August of then-chief=
 executive Jeff Skilling was considered another bad sign.=20
On Oct. 16, Enron reported a net loss of $638 million in the third quarter,=
 taking a one-time charge of $1.01 billion attributed to investment losses,=
 troubled assets and unit restructurings. Excluding the charge, Enron earne=
d $393 million on $47.6 billion in revenues for the three months ending Sep=
t. 30.=20
Ellinghaus said the stocks of Enron's competitors were brought down Wednesd=
ay because of "dire" speculation that Enron's troubles might be so bad that=
 it could have difficulty paying hundreds of millions of dollars worth of r=
eceivables to companies such as Duke and Dynegy.=20
"All I'm hearing is doomsday type stuff and doomsday is not reality," Ellin=
ghaus said.=20
Enron did not return calls seeking comment Thursday.=20
Donnell of Duke Energy said the Charlotte, N.C.-based company is paying clo=
se attention to the Enron situation and that there has been no indication o=
f receivables not being paid.=20
"They continue to be one of the best functioning companies as it relates to=
 credit," he said. "They've never missed a deadline."

Enron's Credit Outlook Downgraded to Negative by S&P (Update1)

Enron's Credit Outlook Downgraded to Negative by S&P (Update1)

     (Adds analyst comment in fourth paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s long-term
credit ratings outlook was changed to negative from stable by
Standard & Poor's after the largest energy trader's shares fell
49 percent in the past week.

     S&P affirmed the Houston-based company's ratings of
``BBB+/A2,'' which are investment grade.

     The ratings company cited lost market capitalization and the
possibility that Enron won't generate enough money from selling
assets outside the main trading business to repay debt. S&P did
say that ``the strategic direction of the company is likely to
become more credit-positive in the wake of recent management
changes.''

     Enron reported $1.01 billion in losses from investments
outside the principal business of trading commodities such as
electricity and natural gas. Chief Financial Officer Andrew
Fastow resigned yesterday as the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission asks for information about related-party transactions
he conducted.

     ``The S&P write up was very positive,'' said Dorothea
Matthews, an analyst at CreditSights Inc., a research firm. ``It
seems that the ratings company went out of its way to tray and
calm things down.''

     Shares of Enron fell 6 cents to $16.35.

Enron's Trading Partners Say It's Business as Usual (Update2)

Enron's Trading Partners Say It's Business as Usual (Update2)

     (Adds new Enron CFO in 14th paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg) -- Concerns Enron Corp. will run
short on cash haven't prevented commodities traders from doing
business with the largest energy broker, customers say.

     The company handles about 25 percent of U.S. power and
natural-gas trading, said John Kilduff, vice president of energy
risk management for Fimat USA. It's also a leader in complex
derivatives that allow others to hedge against the risk of
fluctuating commodities prices.

     Enron's credit rating is on watch for possible downgrade at
Moody's Investors Service, and Standard & Poor's lowered Enron's
long-term credit outlook to negative after $1.01 billion in third-
quarter losses from some soured investments. The company needs
good credit to raise cash every day to keep trading partners from
demanding collateral and to settle transactions.

     So far, there are no signs that Houston-based Enron is
handling less business, Kilduff said.

     ``If they were unable to perform, it would be a major
problem,'' he said. ``It could get like Long-Term Capital if
things really broke down because the numbers are that big.''

     Long-Term Capital Management, a private investment fund for
the wealthy, incurred massive losses making bond trades during the
1998 Russian currency crisis. The fund's portfolio plunged. More
than a dozen banks bailed out the fund at a cost of $3.6 billion
to avoid a collapse.

                         Needs Cash Daily

     Enron trades electricity, natural gas, coal and other
commodities worldwide, as well as complex financial instruments to
hedge against price swings in the goods.

     ``As of now, Enron is active in the markets,'' Kilduff said.
``No one is cutting trading lines that I can see, or demanding
different terms than before.''

     Companies that trade as heavily as Enron require cash every
day to settle positions, said Kilduff, whose company swaps natural
gas and other energy investments with Enron.

     Some days, Fimat will bet that natural-gas prices will fall,
while Enron bets that they will rise. Natural gas usually does one
or the other every day, and someone pays the difference.

     ``The liquidity of your trading partners is a risk factor,''
Kilduff said. ``Someone is paying someone else every day.''

     Enron said on a conference call Tuesday that it has enough
money to operate normally, and can fall back on $3.4 billion in
bank credit lines if necessary. The company is determined to
protect the credit rating, Enron has said.

     ``We aren't even going to entertain worst-case scenarios at
this point,'' said Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne.

                        Investor Questions

     Enron, based in Houston, ousted Chief Financial Officer
Andrew Fastow yesterday, two days after the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission began asking questions about partnerships he
ran that invested in company shares. Those trades cost Enron $35
million. Jeff McMahon, head of Enron's industrial markets unit,
replaced Fastow, who went on leave of absence.

     Enron shares have fallen 49 percent in the past week. They
fell 6 cents to $16.35 today.

     Based on Bloomberg composite ratings, most of Enron's long-
term debt is rated at BBB2 and BBB1, two or three levels above
investment grade. Fitch, Standard & Poor's and Moody's all rate
the company's debt at investment grade.

     The company also faces questions from investors about $3.3
billion in potential liabilities from affiliated companies formed
to buy and sell Enron assets such as power plants.

     The affiliates owe payments to bond investors and plan to
meet them by selling assets. Enron doesn't know if the sale
proceeds will cover the debt. The company would have to make good
on any shortfall.

                            Little Time

     Enron asked Citicorp Inc. on Tuesday to arrange a $750
million loan to ensure access to credit if the company gets shut
out of the money markets.

     Enron had about $1.85 billion of commercial paper, or short-
term unsecured debt, outstanding as of Tuesday, traders said. The
company, which has a $3 billion program, has had difficulty
finding buyers for new commercial paper sales since the SEC
investigation was announced, the traders said.

     Today, Enron offered two-week commercial paper at a 3 percent
yield, 10 to 15 basis points above comparably rated companies.

     ``There appears to be enough liquidity to give them enough
time to get their house in order,'' said Jon Kyle Cartwright,
senior energy credit analyst at Raymond James & Associates.
``There's a point where a credibility crisis becomes a self-
fulfilling prophecy, so they have less time than they think to
pacify the market.''

                           Ripple Effect

     Some investors are concerned that Enron's complex book of
hedges, swaps, options and other derivative contracts involves so
many partners, participants and companies that a failure would
pose a risk to the economy, and force a bailout like Long-Term
Capital Management's.

     ``The talk in the financial markets is that some counter
party to Enron could fail if Enron can't perform,'' said Jeff
Caughron, manager of $400 million in investments for Tinker
Federal Credit Union in Oklahoma City. ``If it goes down, there
could be a big ripple effect.''

     The effect has already spread as investors worry Enron won't
be able to pay bills owed to power producers such as Calpine
Corp., Dynegy Inc., Mirant Corp. and NRG Inc., said Chris
Ellinghaus, an analyst at Williams Capital Group. As a group,
shares of the four have fallen 11 percent in the past week.

     ``Rumors that these companies have receivables with Enron are
fueling a sell-off,'' he said. ``Both traders and companies
selling power to Enron are suffering.''

     All four companies said they're trading with Enron as they
have in the past.

                         Market Maker

     Enron supplies services some customers consider
irreplaceable. The Sacramento Municipal Utilities District hedges
weather risk through Enron, said risk manager Jim Tracy.

     The district entered into an agreement that forces it to pay
Enron if rainfall is abundant and hydroelectric dams can operate
at peak efficiency and capacity; in dry seasons, when the dams
can't operate as well, Enron pays the district.

     ``If Enron's credit went bad, or they folded up, that
agreement wouldn't get picked up by someone else,'' Tracy said.

     Enron also helps many U.S. utilities protect themselves from
electricity and natural gas price fluctuations in the same way it
helps the Sacramento utility district hedge against too little
rainfall. Any impairment on Enron's part to continue doing so
would trickle down to Main Street utilities, Tracy said.

     ``Utilities would start reserving more on their balance
sheets for price swings,'' Tracy said.

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp.'s (ENE) telecommunications unit will clos=

.=20
Enron Broadband Services executives have quietly begun to inform employees =
overseas and haven't made a public announcement of plans to consolidate Asi=

uarters.
"It's a way to structure the business to fit the opportunities that are out=
 there in the market now," Enron Broadband Services spokeswoman Terrie Jame=
s said in response to questions from Dow Jones Newswires.=20
The London office has 20 or fewer employees, James told Dow Jones. The Sing=

Americans working in the offices would probably choose to relocate in the U=

ees.=20
James didn't know how much money Enron might save by closing the offices.=
=20
The decision by Enron, the leading bandwidth market-maker, shows that inter=
national bandwidth markets are having tough times like the U.S. market.=20
Earlier this year, as the U.S. market went sour, Enron executives had said =
that European and Asian telecommunications carriers might be more open to b=

Calpine:No Exposure To Enron; No Calif Pwr Contract Talks

10/25/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Calpine Corp. (CPN) has no credit exposure to tradin=
g partner Enron Corp. (ENE), Calpine said Thursday in an earnings conferenc=
e call. And the company hasn't been contacted by the state of California ab=
out renegotiating the billions of dollars in long-term supply contracts the=
 company signed with the state earlier this year.=20
Calpine's diluted net earnings for the third quarter were 88 cents a share =
compared with 48 cents for the same quarter last year. Setting Calpine's co=
nsistent earnings growth aside, Wall Street analysts in Thursday's conferen=
ce call focused their questions on trouble spots in the energy industry, li=
ke Enron, California, and whether the U.S. will have a surplus of electric =
power stations in a few years.
Moody's has put Enron's credit on watch for possible downgrade, and some of=
 the company's debt is trading like junk bonds in the secondary market this=
 week. Trading partners like Calpine have been asked about their exposure t=
o Enron.=20
"We continue to assess the situation, but right now don't have any net expo=
sure to Enron," said Calpine's vice president of corporate risk management,=
 Paul Pasoli. "We continue to trade with them. We will adjust our credit th=
reshold based on how their bonds are trading and their credit rating."=20
When asked if there would be any exposure to Enron if trading were to be ha=
lted immediately, Pasoli said that, in fact, Calpine would owe Enron a litt=
le money.=20
In another energy industry area of concern, Calpine was asked about the sta=
te of California's stated desire to renegotiate tens of billions of dollars=
 of long-term power contracts. Calpine is by far the biggest supplier under=
 those contracts, which on a mark-to-market basis are worth far less now th=
an when California bought this past winter and spring.=20
"Nobody has come to us directly or indirectly with regard to the Calif cont=
racts. In general, we respect our contracts and expect our counterparties t=
o do so as well," said Calpine cheif executive, Peter Cartwright. "If there=
 are any contract renegotiations that can result in a win-win, we would be =
happy to look at that, if California asks. We've done that many times."=20
As for future power prices, Calpine said that it's going forward with its p=
rogram to build a portfolio of 70,000 megawatts of generation, which is abo=
ut three times its current capacity and would be about 7% of all U.S. capac=
ity. The critical determinant of profitability in power generation is the d=
ifference between natural gas prices and power prices, and Calpine said tha=
t difference, or "spark spread," has grown the past few months. Furthermore=
, the company executives said they are holding to a requirement that all pr=
ojects generate an after-tax return of 18% on the investment.=20
As a result, the company expects earnings to grow at least 40% annually thr=
ough 2005. Calpine will fund near-term cash needs in the debt markets and w=
on't issue new stock until its stock price rises substantially.=20

Spector, Roseman & Kodroff, P.C. Files Class Action Suit Against Enron Corp=
oration

10/25/2001
PR Newswire
(Copyright (c) 2001, PR Newswire)

PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 25 /PRNewswire/ -- The law firm of Spector, Roseman & Ko=
droff, P.C. announces that a class action lawsuit has been commenced in the=
 United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston D=
ivision, against defendants Enron Corporation ("Enron" or the "Company") (N=
YSE: ENE), Kenneth L. Lay, Jeffrey K. Skilling, and Andrew Fastow, on behal=
f of purchasers of the common stock of Enron during the period between Janu=
ary 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, inclusive (the "Class Period").=20
The Complaint alleges that defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of =
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder,=
 by issuing a series of material misrepresentations to the market between J=
anuary 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, thereby artificially inflating the pr=
ice of Enron common stock. Specifically, the complaint alleges that Enron i=
ssued a series of statements concerning its business, financial results and=
 operations which failed to disclose (i) that the Company's Broadband Servi=
ces Division was experiencing declining demand for bandwidth and the Compan=
y's efforts to create a trading market for bandwidth were not meeting with =
success as many of the market participants were not creditworthy; (ii) that=
 the Company's operating results were materially overstated as result of th=
e Company failing to timely write-down the value of its investments with ce=
rtain limited partnerships which were managed by the Company's chief financ=
ial officer; and (iii) that Enron was failing to write-down impaired assets=
 on a timely basis in accordance with GAAP. On October 16, 2001, Enron surp=
rised the market by announcing that the Company was taking non-recurring ch=
arges of $1.01 billion after-tax, or ($1.11) loss per diluted share, in the=
 third quarter of 2001, the period ending September 30, 2001. Subsequently,=
 Enron revealed that a material portion of the charge related to the unwind=
ing of investments with certain limited partnerships which were controlled =
by Enron's chief financial officer and that the Company would be eliminatin=
g more than $1 billion in shareholder equity as a result of its unwinding o=
f the investments. As this news began to be assimilated by the market, the =
price of Enron common stock dropped significantly. During the Class Period,=
 Enron insiders disposed of over $73 million of their personally held Enron=
 common stock to unsuspecting investors.
If you purchased Enron securities during the Class Period, you may, no late=
r than December 21, 2001, move to be appointed as a Lead Plaintiff in this =
class action. A Lead Plaintiff is a representative, chosen by the Court, th=
at acts on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. The P=
rivate Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 directs Courts to assume th=
at the class member(s) with the "largest financial interest" in the outcome=
 of the case will best serve the class in this capacity. Courts have discre=
tion in determining which class member(s) have the "largest financial inter=
est," and have appointed Lead Plaintiffs with substantial losses in both ab=
solute terms and as a percentage of their net worth. If you have sustained =
substantial losses in Enron securities during the Class Period, please cont=
act Spector, Roseman & Kodroff, P.C. at classaction@srk-law.com for a more =
thorough explanation of the Lead Plaintiff selection process. If you have r=
elatively small losses, your ability to participate in any recovery will be=

 at this time.=20

Enron Draws Down Credit Facility

10/25/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) drew on committed lines of credit t=
o provide cash liquidity of more than $1 billion.=20
In a press release Thursday, the energy company said it has "more than adeq=
uate" liquidity to fulfill business commitments.
Enron said the credit action is a step to restore investor confidence, and =
it plans to update investors in several days regarding plans to maintain it=
s long-term credit rating.=20
Earlier Thursday, Standard & Poor's revised its long-term ratings outlook f=
or Enron to negative due to concerns that the company's significant drop in=
 market capitalization has hurt the company's flexibility and could impair =
plans to rebuild the balance sheet.=20
Over the past week, Enron's shares have fallen more than 40% amid negative =
news from the company.=20
The company's New York Stock Exchange-listed shares closed Thursday at $16.=
35, down 6 cents, or 0.4%, on composite volume of 39,212,300 shares. Averag=
e daily volume is 7,832,606 shares.=20
Early last week, the company reported a $618 million third quarter loss, re=
sulting from $1.01 billion in write-offs. Enron also disclosed a $1.2 billi=
on reduction in shareholder equity for the quarter as a result of terminati=
ng certain transactions related to a partnership that for a time was headed=
 by Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow.=20
On Wednesday, Enron replaced Fastow with Jeff McMahon, effective immediatel=
y.=20

The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that some bond traders believe En=
ron's bonds won't continue to hold up better the company's stock.=20
The company's five-year bond has decreased about 16% in the past two weeks,=
 much less than the 50% decline in Enron's stock price since the Oct. 16 di=
sclosure of the $1.01 billion charges.=20
But the fall in the bond's price translates to a yield of 7.7 percentage po=
ints above bellwether U.S. government bonds, which is widening from about 3=
 percentage points two weeks ago. Although Enron is still an investment-gra=
de credit, that kind of "spread" is more characteristic of a junk bond with=
 a credit rating of single B or lower, the Journal said.=20
On Wednesday, Fitch put Enron's credit rating on watch for a possible downg=
rade, following a similar move by Moody's Investor Service earlier this wee=
k.=20
Several energy trading companies said Thursday that although they have conc=
erns about Enron's credit quality, they have made almost no changes in poli=
cy concerning the company.=20
Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Williams Cos. (WMB) and Aquila Inc. (ILA) said they have=
n't changed their credit policy concerning Enron, which accounts for about =
a quarter of the trade in U.S. power and gas markets.=20
The Journal reported that bond traders expect Enron executives to meet with=
 rating agencies, debt-trading desks, big bond holders and banks next week.=

Enron Employees Watch Options Devalue as Shares Fall (Correct)
2001-10-25 18:41 (New York)

Enron Employees Watch Options Devalue as Shares Fall (Correct)

     (Company corrects structure of standard compensation package
in second paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. prided itself on
sharing the wealth with employees when the company was posting
record profits last year. Now, from the boardroom to the mailroom,
employees are sharing the pain.

     Enron, the largest energy trader, grants stock options to the
bulk of its 20,000 employees. Under Enron's standard compensation
package, most employees get stock options equal to
5 percent of their annual base salary, spokeswoman Meredith
Philipp said.

     Employees held 46.8 million exercisable options as of the end
of 2000, all at average prices above the company's current share
price. The stock has dropped 80 percent this year.

     ``Virtually every option is under water right now,'' Enron
spokeswoman Karen Denne said.

     Enron's board sets the strike price for the options in
December or January. Employees can't cash the options in and make
a profit unless the stock is trading above the strike price. At
the end of 2000, Enron shares were trading at $83.13. In December,
the board set a strike price of about $80.

     Shares of Houston-based Enron fell 6 cents to $16.35 today.
They have lost 37 percent of their value so far this week.

     Enron said Monday that the Securities and Exchange Commission
was asking questions about partnerships run by Andrew Fastow, who
was ousted as Enron's chief financial officer yesterday. One
partnership cost the company $35 million, and Enron bought back 62
million shares from a partnership at a cost of $1.2 billion.

     Enron named Jeff McMahon, head of its industrial markets
group, as CFO late yesterday.

                         Unvested Options

     Another 96.1 million options granted to Enron employees
hadn't vested as of the end of last year. About 15.4 million of
them, or 16 percent, were at prices ranging from $6.88 to $20 a
share. The rest vest at levels well above the current share price.

     Experts who have watched the devaluation of stock options in
other industries, such as technology and telecommunications, say
it becomes demoralizing for workers to watch share prices fall
below their options.

     ``It looks bad,'' said Mark Edwards, chairman of IQuantic
Buck, a Mellon Financial Corp. unit that provides compensation
consulting. ``Employees look at (the stock price) every day, and
it's a continued disincentive to them.''

     While Denne said Enron doesn't have any plans to reprice its
employees' options, the company did issue a one-time stock option
grant at $36.88 in August, when Ken Lay resumed his former role as
the company's chief executive. Lay, who had held the job for 15
years, turned the position over to Jeffrey Skilling in February.
Skilling quit in August, citing family reasons.

     The August grant, which was equivalent to 5 percent of
employees' base salary, didn't require a vesting period, but was
exercisable immediately. Enron's shares haven't closed above
$36.88 since Aug. 29.

Jeff,

We have been working to try and get the crude products available in yen, but have not had much luck after Darren left.  You can see the general summary of the situation below.  We'd like to get the product up and believe that with some basic publicity it could be quite successful.  Any ideas on how to overcome these points?

Joe

After spending some time with Houston and London people over the past 2 weeks, the conclusion is that George cannot be up and running within the next 2-3 months. Obtaining live FX quotes is the major issue. Options that we considered were:

(a) Connect up to a bank's FX online system

Shane Dallman (UK) identified potential issues with this, the main one being technical issues associated with the EOL application. After consulting with EOL people, it appears the FX manager application is not suitable for linking to an external party at the moment. They are working on these issues as part of a larger development project but I cannot get a clear timetable out of them

(b) Get Thomas Cheng to run the FX manager

Issues include: 
* Thomas doesn't feel comfortable having to watch the FX market on a real time basis and update prices accordingly, given most of his time is spent on metals
* In that case, FX group would like automatic updates of the FX price from the market so he would not have to watch it all the time (we then get back to IT issues which Shane is checking out)

(c) Get a FX trader in Japan

The FX group is currently considering their staffing requirements but Pushkar Shahi (Director, FX Houston) said that there are no immediate plans to get someone out here.

I will keep monitoring the FX situation. Perhaps if you have time next week, you could speak to Gary Hickerson to get his thoughts.

Regards
Rousseau

So far this quarter we've spend about 18 million on a reserve that Randy Petersen/Credit are making us take on an option we have associated with the MTBE project.  In essence, Randy P doesn't understand how we trade options at Enron, and I'll be having a conversation with Rick about this.  We've spent almost 5 million in getting out of physical positions since no one will buy from or sell to us.  We can't manage the physical positions and obligations we have since there is no money available to the crude group (to purchase physical or post LC's in the case of a sale).  Wev'e also spent about 10+ million closing down books and getting out of positions as the market gives us the chance.  More than half the books have been closed and we will close/consolidate four more tonight.  As you know, getting out of any positions costs money, and the market smells blood.

Because the crude and products markets have been moving significantly recently, we can't manage our options position by getting out of them.  Again, nobody will buy from us or sell options to us, so we have to try to neg. gamma trade it.  

That is the 30 second version of the cluster I'm trying to close, hope it helps.

So, can we change the severance program as I've outlined?

As you guys go through working up a severance program, I started thinking about some equity issues.  If the average tenure of an employee at Enron is about 3 years, why not come up with 2 plans--1 for long serving employees who have been long dedicated to the company, and a second one for the more recently hired?  It doesnt' make sense to me that someone who has been here under a year at $100,000 base should be entitled to 11 weeks even before they sign the waiver.  I would also not change the program in whatever form you ultimately settle on for the longer serving employees, rather just scale back the program for the newer employees.

Jeff

Effective Monday, October 22, 2001 the following changes will be made to the Autohedge functionality on EnronOnline.

The volume on the hedge will now respect the minimum volume and volume increment settings on the parent product. See rules below: 

?	If the transaction volume on the child is less than half of the parent's minimum volume no hedge will occur.
?	If the transaction volume on the child is more than half the parent's minimum volume but less than half the volume increment on the parent, the hedge will volume will be the parent's minimum volume.
?	For all other volumes, the same rounding rules will apply based on the volume increment on the parent product.

Please see example below:

Parent's Settings:
Minimum: 	5000
Increment:  1000

Volume on Autohedge transaction			Volume Hedged
1      - 2499							0
2500 - 5499							5000
5500 - 6499							6000

Mike/Jeff,

I had wanted to speak with you about this last week, but the time did not allow.  We currently have less than 5 spaces left on the trading floor.  The total build out costs would be just under USD800k (@ JPY120).  Getting the buildout in motion would allow this to be completed by beginning to mid December.  I don't mean to rush, but if ok, I'd like to give go ahead this week.

Joe,

Pls find attached the budget plan and layout for your approval.

The outline of this build out is as follows:
1) New Space
-add 64 trading desks
-open meeting spaces for internal meeting
-add filing cabinet
-remove the wall dividing the two spaces

2) Existing Space
-expand public space by changing storage/mgr room to meeting rooms

I appreciate if we could have this plan approved by the end of next week so that we can place the order for A/C by September 21 to meet the schedule. 

Should you need any further information, pls let me know.

Regards,

Akiko

Dear Mr Shankman,
How's it going? As you may remember, I met you, Mr LeBeau, Ms Leibman, and Ms Li Sun at Cavanaughs with Matt Commons a few weeks ago.

During that meeting, you suggested that I visit Enron down in Houston in the next few weeks. As I have not been placed on the closed interview list at Wharton, I was wondering if I could conduct the interview process while in Houston? Please see my updated resume attached for your review.

Please let me know if this would be possible. I am still very interested in obtaining a full-time position in the Associate Program at Enron.

Kind regards,
Edward Divgi

A FEW WORDS ON ENRON
As detailed in past notes including our most recent "Progress, But Much More
Work Ahead", we have been highly critical of Enron for some time.  In fact,
with the benefit of hindsight 20/20 vision, the reality is we should have
downgraded our rating a long time ago.  
Looking ahead, despite the positive move forward in replacing its CFO, there
are serious issues and questions remaining.  These include those pertaining
to: 1) multiple shareholder lawsuits from past management statements
regarding the overall underlying performance of the company while there was
insider selling; 2) the reality that - beyond potential conflicts of
interest - the high profile partnerships in question helped to insulate
ENE's earnings from substantial downward portfolio valuations; 3) additional
- albeit smaller - charges are likely down the road as other assets are
revalued; 4) the successful execution of pending material asset sales such
as Portland General; 5) the leverage within its more traditional off-balance
sheet vehicles that could ultimately wind up on its books and cause earnings
dilution under the unlikely scenario that the company is to be downgraded
three notches to below investment grade; and 6) the ability of management to
regain credibility with the Street.
On the other hand, counterparties continue to actively trade with Enron.  It
is still the market maker.  In the event of a "push-comes-to-shove"
liquidity crunch, we believe the company could generate substantial cash by
selling a variety of other assets including its Pipelines segment.  At a
minimum, if ENE shares were to deteriorate much further, we would view it as
a potential acquisition target for other substantially larger and better
capitalized entities looking to immediately become a sizable player in the
global unregulated wholesale / retail energy space.
When all is said and done, to the best of our ability in distilling all of
the facts and pushing aside the growing level of baseless arb-driven noise
surrounding this complex situation, we believe the risk/reward dynamics in
ENE shares have improved.  That is, though there are no guarantees and
headline volatility will be the norm for some time, we believe the odds of
this company becoming completely illiquid are low; while the odds of it
regaining some level of stature and/or returning an attractive return to
shareholders from current levels over the next 12-18 months are
medium-to-high.  We also believe that the collateral damage to the rest of
the space (such as Dynegy and El Paso) is overdone, providing an attractive
buying opportunity.  With nothing but our client's best interest in mind, we
will continue to vigilantly monitor this situation.

Effective Monday, October 22, 2001 the following changes will be made to the Autohedge functionality on EnronOnline.

The volume on the hedge will now respect the minimum volume and volume increment settings on the parent product. See rules below: 

?	If the transaction volume on the child is less than half of the parent's minimum volume no hedge will occur.
?	If the transaction volume on the child is more than half the parent's minimum volume but less than half the volume increment on the parent, the hedge will volume will be the parent's minimum volume.
?	For all other volumes, the same rounding rules will apply based on the volume increment on the parent product.

Please see example below:

Parent's Settings:
Minimum: 	5000
Increment:  1000

Volume on Autohedge transaction			Volume Hedged
1      - 2499							0
2500 - 5499							5000
5500 - 6499							6000

BP Texas City, Texas is returning to normal operation on a 35,000-bpd catcracker and 24,000-bpd alkylation unit. These units were shut second week October for about a 4 week maintenance program. BP continued to run its other 2 cats rated in total at 175,000-bpd and other 40,000-bpd alkylation unit. BP now plans mid-Jan to idle 1 of 2 reformers rated at 80,000-bpd mid-Jan for 4-5 wks. Last week in Feb, one of two crude units rated at about 220,000-bpd for 6-8 weeks. The other crude unit, about the same capacity will remain up. The other 60,000-bpd reformer will remain up during the Jan outage.

George,

I would be happy to discuss with you.  It remains critical that we manage all cash requirements as our access to capital markets has been impacted over the past few weeks.  Hopefully the announcement on Friday will improve our ability to execute transactions like this in future, but prior to Friday this was a necessary precaution.  Unfortunately, you are working at a different company than you were a few weeks ago.

We can discuss next week.

The Bengalla deal was struck after I had given ECAP notice of the liquidity problems, and more importantly, without any RAC involvement.

>From a RAC perspective this deal is still unapproved.  If an invoice discount facility can be used, or some other means of performing without using Enron capital then you should move forward.  If these options are not available, then the issue should either be raised to Louise Kitchen for approval or unwound until the liquidity problems are resolved.

		I assume this does not apply to ECTRL business, as we have not been given a reciprocal recommendation for European biz.  Can you confirm this?  Also, can you clarify what the specific issue is with ECAP that is not an issue with ECTRL?  Is this specific to cash flow within Australian entities?

		Thanks,

			In light of the current situation in Houston, I recommend we wait to finalize any physical coal sourcing or deliveries in the ECAP business.  In short, RAC cannot approve any purchase or sale until the liquidity issues are resolved.  Hopefully by the end of the week we will know more, have things settled, and business can continue as normal.

Guys - see e-mail below from Bill re: development of an EGM Website.  While the initial template is focused on crude/products, the format is easily expandable/adaptable to incorporate other EGM businesses.  Please review the info and let me know what you think, how you want to proceed, etc...  Cost is $25K+/-.

Randy, as we discussed,  I need your approval to proceed with a $25,000 expenditure to develop a client website. The site will provide secure access for customers & prospects to selected internally generated fundy reports, historical price charts, and indicative pricing. Morgan Stanley, J. Aron, and BP all have similar sites and customers frequently ask where our site is. 

Access to the site will be administered by my group (Admin & analyst) and maintenance will be provided buy Enron I.T. as needed. 

The current scope of the project is concentrating on crude & refined products, but the incremental expenditure required will be minimal to expand it to other EGM commodity groups if desired.

Attached is a copy of the statement of work for the project.


 

The I.T. group is ready to get started on the project immediately with a planned "go-live" date before the end of the year, so your prompt attention will be greatly appreciated.

George,

Jeff has just signed your expense account from last month.  It has been on hold because we have stopped approving all submitted reports that include car services (for all of EGM) that are outside of the direct airport to the hotel charges.  We have made statements to everyone via memo and our commitment to our bosses that we are watching our costs especially those like these specifically.  In most cities cabs or other shorter hires are available.  

We are not attempting to be cheap but we have put this is a hard rule and of course includes Jeff and me.  We haven't and will not do it either.  We don't want to discuss this further and it is not something we will think about again but we wanted to be clear.

Thanks,
Mike and Jeff

Subject:	Increasing Washington Concerns over Potential Instability in Pakistan, India, and Saudi Arabia
Importance:	High
Sensitivity:	Confidential

In the wake of US and British military action in Afghanistan, Washington has become increasingly concerned about the potential for a major military conflict between Pakistan and India, according to a high level US intelligence official, and the control of nuclear weapons in the region is being monitored.  There is also fear for instability in Saudi Arabia, where little information is available about the capabilities and intentions of Islamic extremist elements.  Consensus opinion has been built in Washington that Iraq was involved in the 11 September terrorist attacks on the US, exacerbating fears that the situation in the region could spiral out of control.  

According to a senior US intelligence official, US policymakers have become increasingly concerned about the prospects for instability in the Middle East and South Asia.  Washington is focused particularly on the potential for a major conflict between Pakistan and India, and intelligence officials are attempting to track the location and control of nuclear weapons in the region.  Secretary of State Powell's trip to the two countries, although portrayed publicly as part of the effort to ensure support for US military action in Afghanistan, is in fact intended to address tensions between Islamabad and New Delhi, which have grown in recent days.  (India shelled several Pakistani military outposts in the disputed Kashmir territory today; an Indian army general described it as a "punitive action.")

Washington is also significantly more concerned than media coverage would suggest over the potential for major unrest in Saudi Arabia.  This fear is heightened by a lack of detailed information available on the royal family's grip on power and the capabilities of Islamic extremist elements in Saudi Arabia, which share similar goals: removal of the Saudi dynasty, establishment of a true Islamic state, and the removal of the US military presence.  Saudi and US officials regard bin Ladin as one of the prime perpetrators of Islamic extremist violence in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere in the region.  Bin Ladin has been outspoken in his criticism of what he calls 'military occupation' of Saudi Arabia.  Unrest in Saudi Arabia could have a relatively dramatic impact on regional stability and the global economy because of its leading role both in the Arab world and in OPEC.

US government officials are now generally convinced that the Iraqi government played a role in supporting the 11 September terrorist strikes in the US.  The well-publicized difference of opinion between senior State and Defense Department officials over the handling of the Iraq question has been reported accurately in the media. Concern is growing within Washington that the situation in the Middle East could spiral out of control if Iraq were drawn into the military conflict precipitously, if major hostilities between Pakistan and India were to break out, or if the Saudi royal family's grip on power were to loosen.

Vikas Dwivedi, formerly an associate at Enron, recently left our company to work for Carol Coale at Prudential.

Guys,

As of this morning, these are the counterparties that are not trading with us:

BHP Billiton--no coal, yes vessels

Koch-generally no crude and products, but they have traded some small weather products.

Shell  (Stasco, Equiva)--no trades

Bank of Montreal--no trades  (started several weeks ago)

Phibro--appear to be no trades, but hard to confirm

BP--no trades.

Diamond Shamrock has a very small spread position on with us, and asked us to find someone to stand between.

Sempra is looking at their exposure to us in physical products, and asking questions about our docs.

Innogy--In Europe, no longer trading weather with us.

ICE--The Majors have cut us off.

More info to follow as discovered.

Subject:	December Crude

Tomorrow is the final day to schedule December barrels, and we are currently short 1,220,000 barrels.  We have exhausted all measures of buying crude including: settling sales financially, buying from companies where we have short positions, and selling physical puts.  As a group, we have reduced our short physical position from over 10 million barrels to 1.2 under extremely difficult credit terms.  We believe we cannot cover the remaining 1.2 without prepaying a counterparty.  This requires a cash infusion of approximately $22,631,000 (1,220 X $18.55/barrel). 

Every effort will be made within the next 24 hours to reduce this position, but the outlook is not bright.  Please let me know as soon as possible what can be made available to us.

Sincerely,

Rob Fuller

While the initial template is focused on crude/products, the format is easily expandable/adaptable to incorporate other EGM businesses.  Please review the info and let me know what you think, how you want to proceed, etc...  Cost is $25K+/-.

Randy, as we discussed,  I need your approval to proceed with a $25,000 expenditure to develop a client website. The site will provide secure access for customers & prospects to selected internally generated fundy reports, historical price charts, and indicative pricing. Morgan Stanley, J. Aron, and BP all have similar sites and customers frequently ask where our site is. 

Access to the site will be administered by my group (Admin & analyst) and maintenance will be provided buy Enron I.T. as needed. 

The current scope of the project is concentrating on crude & refined products, but the incremental expenditure required will be minimal to expand it to other EGM commodity groups if desired.

Attached is a copy of the statement of work for the project.


 << File: EGM_ExtraNet_Statement_of_Work.doc >> 

The I.T. group is ready to get started on the project immediately with a planned "go-live" date before the end of the year, so your prompt attention will be greatly appreciated.

Jeff,

Details of the weather transaction we discussed yesterday (requiring a cash collateralized account in lieu of a letter of credit). This would be the first weather deal done in Latin America and hopefully create other opportunities with the Mexican government. Let me know if you have time to discuss further (I'd like to get your input before proceeding with Treasury).

Thanks,

Jeff,

Confidentially, EBS in London is preparing to wind down, though officially no decision has been made.  I'll be back in Houston the week of the 21st talking to a variety of people about opportunities in Houston.  I'd like to schedule a little time with you that week. 

I'd appreciate any ideas you may have on where things are going and where a former spy/bandwidth trader might want to position himself.  Quite honestly, I'm looking for something compelling to do in Houston - Washington has been calling for me to return.

Look forward to seeing you.

Hi Ken,

Many of my team appreciated your voice mail today.  I think they appreciated your candor about Andy, and more importantly, they appreciated your tone.  I think it would be helpful if you left frequent (weekly, or so) general updates to the degree you can.

Mike and I had a very successful floor meeting today, and so many of our employees came up to us after to mention their appreciation of our having such a meeting.

Your voice mails are great, and we need to use you more often.  I'd love (and I'm sure I speak for Mike on this) for you to attend one of our weekly staff meetings in the near future.

Of course, if there is anything I can do to help, please let me know.

Regards,

Jeff

Gentlemen,
 
As a follow-up to the question regarding the reliability of DOE vs API numbers:
 
According to our contacts at the API, API checks the relability of their numbers against the DOE.  Specifically with their import numbers, API claims that their import assessment captures 95% of all imports.  The imports they use as their benchmark for this statistic are the DOEs.
 
Matt Anderson will be working on an analysis today.

Unfortunately, it is considered a gift.  Thus, you will not be able to take a
tax deduction on your return.  However, your sister will get the benefit of
avoiding a great deal of capital gains tax.  If you will e mail me the
following, I will prepare the paperwork on both accounts for her signatures:

          social security #
          address for mailing statements
          date of birth
          name of employer
          husband's name
          husband's social sec #


I would highly recommend using the aged based plan that will become increasingly
more conservative as the child reaches the age to enter college. i.e.,  the plan
will weigh more toward bonds and cash with time, less on stocks.

Joe, 

I can only imagine that your experiences with diabetes helped more than we will know.  It was an extremely difficult situation, and I really wanted to thank you for your ability to recognize the situation.  Workplace incidents like this are very hard to manage on so many fronts.  Your help today is appreciated by everyone in EGM.

I hear you on the vol, but it hasn't paid off.  I want everyone to focus on their expertise.  Focus on the underlying business is crucial, and chris mentioned to me that no one in London is an experienced daily vol trader.  I would like you guys to get out.

Chris was on the way to the airport so he asked me to send you a note 

Over the last five days the mahoney/o'brien books have lost 1 million dollars on vega against calendar 2002  19/30 brent short strangle.
vol for cal 02 is now 42.5 pct and we feel this is not a good level at which to cover this position, however the market appears liquid enough to close out if required. 

Today i have rolled 330 mb short cracks in q1 and q2 effectively reducing that exposure by two thirds, i expect to have the rest covered tomorrow 

I plan to maintain jet and kero diff shorts as this market is still under considerable pressure. prompt barrels trading at 17.50 over, deferred paper values are still in the high twenties, and airline demand shows no sign of improvement.

If you want to talk to chris i expect he will be available around 9.30 pm london time.

Jeff,

I have just returned from U Penn recruiting and it was a very successful trip.  In response to Aziz Fakir's e-mail, he was interviewed by Christie Patrick and Chris Hilgert on 1st rounds and was passed onto 2nd rounds.  He was their top candidate.  However, during second rounds, interviewing with Jen Frazer and Sarah Mulholland, he was not passed onto SuperSaturday.  From talking to Jen and Sarah, he did not rank as high as other candidates did.

We interviewed 20 people for second rounds.  All of the candidates were top-notch and the competition was staunch.  We are bringing back 11 Analyst for Final Rounds in Houston.  I can provide you with the evaluations of Aziz and if you want to bring him down we can.  

Jen also meet with Jonathan Tyburski and she feels that we should renew his offer.  I will let our office know and we will start the paperwork.

Please let me know your decision.

Thank you,

Paul LeBeau

B and T,
I interviewed this guy yesterday, as did Chris M(can't remember his last name but he's a Director in Compression Svs Group).  For the record, but not to interfere with or prejudice the process, both Chris and I felt Aziz was, hands down, the best of about 10 candidates we interviewed. Paul does not have a blackberry or I wd sendthis msg to him.

Hi Christie,
                   I just received your response and tried calling to thank you for interviewing me yesterday. Your personal and prompt email is truly representative of Enron's ability to not only hire but also retain the best and the brightest. Up until today I have found no recruiter to bring out the problematic issues of a firm. The very fact that you put Enron's current problems on the table shows how strongly and genuinely you feel about the firm being secure and stable. I really appreciated you letting me defend Enron; it not only shows you my passion but also reiterates my genuine interest in the firm.
I am writing to let you know that I had second rounds today as you know and in the first interview, which was supposed to be conducted by Jen Fraser but was conducted by Matt, a first year analyst, the concern was on GPA and academic performance rather that what value I can add or my keen interest in the firm. I was extremely shaken after this first interview; in the interview right after, Sarah, an associate, did manage to alleviate some of my concerns. However, I was wondering if this could possibly serve as a road block in the recruiting process as I really do not believe that my GPA is low or an accurate representation of my capabilities to perform on the job. I honestly feel that a 3.2 at Wharton equates to a much higher GPA at any other school in the United States.
Although disheartened, I am extremely interested in Enron as a firm and am confident that if given the chance I will emerge as one of your most valued candidates. Thank you so very much.

Sincerely,
Aziz.

Jeff,

Spoke to Michelle on Friday, she suggested that we have Masha Ariefieva, Andrew Hill and Dee Ware return to work as soon as possible.

I was thinking I would call each of them this afternoon to tell them to come back in starting tomorrow.  I would also plan to call Lowell, Matt and Matt to give him a head's up that they would be returning.  We would not share the results of the investigation with them, but would ask that they not discuss the case with anyone.

Ryan Seleznov has a meeting scheduled with Jen on Monday, 11/26.  Jeff's atty has been told that following the meeting with Jen, we would be prepared to issue a decision.

Ok with you?

Shanna

Given the volatility in the gas market (which is the sole impact on the Canadian power book's US dollar exposure) and the exhorbitant cost involved in hedging multi-year cashflows (i.e. as evidenced by Friday 10/19/2001 trade of -$1,200,000 Cdn new deal value for the 14 year swap that I entered into), I will manage the currency exposure of this book myself, I will hedge appropriately when I see fit and will not accept hedges forced on Enron Canada because of arbitrary position limits set by your department.

With the recent movement in long term interest rates, I thought I would update you on Enron's exposure to Greenfield. Enron has a long term interest rate swap (which is in the money to Enron) in place with Greenfield, which has recently appreciated considerably. Preserving the value of this swap has become our top priority.

This is a quick summary of Enron's exposure to Greenfield.

Greenfield (In order of seniority):
Senior Debt			110mn
Additional Sponsor Loans	55mn (Not yet funded)
ECT Interest Rate Swap		16mn
Shareholder Loans		9mn
Equity				55mn
Total				245mn

Enron Exposure (In order of seniority):
Additional Sponsor Loans 	11mn (Not yet funded, no obligation to do so)
ECT Interest Rate Swap		16mn
Shareholder Loans		2.4mn
Equity				11mn
Total				29.4mn (Excluding Additional Sponsor Loan)

Current discussions center around a sale of the vessel to a third party. El Paso have recently submitted a letter indicating a potential bid of 210-215 million. If this sale were to be completed, Enron would recover the swap breakage of 16mn and the Shareholder loan of 2.4mn entirely, and would recover approximaetly $4 million of equity, resulting in an overall write off of approximately $7mn. The timing of this transaction is not yet certain, but our intention would be to delay until Q102. A sale to a third party at this level would represent the best possible solution for Enron, and our efforts are concentrated in this area

In discussions held last week with Jim Hughes, Jim indicated that he thought it was appropriate that his group should bear the loss associated with this transaction, as it was originally entered into because of Dabhol. The Global LNG group and the Finance group will continue to push as hard as possible to resolve this matter in the best interests of Enron, and we remain in constant liaison with the DPC group.

Please feel free to contact us if you have any further questions.

Thanks,
Jonathan

To remain consistent with Enron's directive to improve security access to the building, all Enron Body Shop members are required to check-in at the Body Shop Front Desk and present an Enron Photo ID badge or another form of Photo ID to the Security Officer each time you visit.  To assist our members who participate in outdoor activities during their visit, Security SMART ID tags are available at the Body Shop Front Desk for your convenience.  Simply slide the SMART ID tag through the shoe laces between an eyelet and snap the tag closed.  

The SMART ID tags serve both as a safety identification tag while members are exercising off property as well as provide the security identification verification required when entering the Body Shop.  Each day you plan to exercise outside, present your Enron Photo ID Badge or another form of Photo ID to the Front Desk Receptionist to receive your temporary Security SMART ID.  Your Photo ID will be returned to you when you return the SMART ID tag to the Front Desk at the end of your visit.

I had a conversation yesterday with Paul Burgener, Corp Risk Mgr, at DTE in Detroit. He told me that cash transactions with Enron are "business as usual" but that all term trades now receive increased scrutiny and                                                    are to be avoided, particularly if a reasonable substitute exists.Though he did not go so far as to say we were cut off, it's clear to Paul's group that term trades with Enron are not career enhancers.

Mike/Jeff,
=20
We have updated the business summary form that you asked me for yesterday. =
 In addition to your requests we have included estimates for business liqui=
dation costs.  As you will see there is very little difference ($1.8 MM) be=
tween our assumed scaled down (Top Team) costs for 2002 and the costs to li=
quidate the business ($ 7.8 MM).  Given that we are seeing deal flow and tr=
ansactions after less than 1/2 year with EGM in a brand new market, we woul=
d expect to break even for 2002.  If this is then compared to the liquidati=
on costs, I believe an obvious question to shutdown would be why ($1.8MM di=
fference assuming no earnings for 2002... and we will make earnings)?  My e=
xperience at Enron with startup businesses usually entails investment the f=
irst year, break even the second and break out the third.  I believe we are=
 on track to do this.  The head start from other competitors, the state of =
the Japanese market and the demand for risk mgt products further underscore=
s the value in the proposition.
=20
It has been sometime since either you or Jeff have been over to Japan and a=
llowed us to give you a full business review.  A lot has changed over this =
period.  We had hoped to do this with Jeff, but events of the last week hav=
e clearly overshadowed and precluded this.  While I understand everyone is =
trying to gain clarity as soon as possible, I believe that it is imperative=
 that Japan be given a chance to present its case over the next 1-2 weeks. =
 I am fully prepared to visit Houston and demonstrate the clear case for th=
is business as a prime marketing/origination vehicle for Japan and Asia wit=
h clear options to develop a local trading presence. =20
=20
I look forward to speaking with you further about this.

We have made the  following modifications to the EnronOnline applications.

Stack Manager Changes

Fill Order Enhancements - (Effective Tuesday September 25)
?	To fill a Top of Stack order in Stack Manager, Right click on the pink shaded order in the depth window of Stack Manager and select fill.
?	The trader now has the ability to fill limit orders that appear at the top of the trader's stack on both sides. 
?	The order will now be filled at the full order volume regardless of the trader's stack volume.
?	Filling an order will not move the trader's price or cause a hedge to occur.

Resize floated stack windows- (Effective Tuesday September 25)

You will now have the ability to resize the stack window to the desired extent.

Website Changes ( Effective Monday September 24)

Limit Order Restrictions on Physical Transactions -
?	Customers will not be allowed to transact with themselves on physical transactions. If a top of stack limit order has been placed on a physical product the counterparty or desk that placed the order will not be allowed to transact on it.
?	If a customer or desk has top of stack limit orders at different prices on both the bid and offer and subsequently moves the price of one so that they are at the same price, both orders will be cancelled. The customer would have effectively transacted with himself.

Please call me if you have any questions. Thanks.

Subject:	EnronOnline- Change to Autohedge

Effective Monday, October 22, 2001 the following changes will be made to the Autohedge functionality on EnronOnline.

The volume on the hedge will now respect the minimum volume and volume increment settings on the parent product. See rules below: 

?	If the transaction volume on the child is less than half of the parent's minimum volume no hedge will occur.
?	If the transaction volume on the child is more than half the parent's minimum volume but less than half the volume increment on the parent, the hedge will volume will be the parent's minimum volume.
?	For all other volumes, the same rounding rules will apply based on the volume increment on the parent product.

Please see example below:

Parent's Settings:
Minimum: 	5000
Increment:  1000

Volume on Autohedge transaction			Volume Hedged
1      - 2499							0
2500 - 5499							5000
5500 - 6499							6000

Hi Joe,

Are you looking for any options traders?  I know a guy in NYC who wants to stay there, who has years of energy trading and options experience.  He's very strong, and would be a benefit to the group.  Also, if you hear of options guys that are interested in houston/london, let me know if they aren't a fit for you.

Regards,

Jeff

I'm sure you've been going through some pretty tough shit lately.  Just
wanted to say hi and I hope you're doing well.  I'd be happy to help take
your mind off of things if you want to head to the region.  (not that life

Take care,

Hi Carol, I was thinking about a few more shirts.  You really need to have
a referral discount or some other incentive program for your clients.  It
may help.

   Subject:  Can you help me?

   I was wondering if you might be able to help me.  I need to finish
   strong
   this year.  I am attempting to reach the goal of $336,000 in clothing
   sales
   by the end of the year.  Obviously, no single client will be able to
   help me
   do this.  So I was wondering if you might be able to help me out by
   giving
   me the names of some qualified gentlemen or ladies that might be
   interested
   in the type of service we offer.

   Some things to consider:

   We offer ready-made (off the rack) clothing as well as custom.
   We offer all types of men's clothing including casual.

   If you know of some mid to upper level executive women, they may have an
   interest as well.

   Some memory joggers:

   Who is the best dressed man or woman you know?
   Who do you know that likes nice cars?
   Who do you know that owns their own company?
   Who do you know that is successful in sales?
   Who do you know that wears an expensive watch?
   Who do you know that owns their own airplane?
   Who do you know that might have a hard time fitting in typical clothing?

   Thanks for your help!

Jeff,

I have looked at the PL for the longterm book and I do not see this big gamma move that u asked me about.  I did move 
the naf/c3 relations for Q2/Q3 2002.  The P&L impact of that was aprox 200k.  

The historical C3/Naf relationship in Europe is close to the 95% mark.  I moved them yesterday to an average of 97.5% from 
100%. as I am getting ready to move the pos from the Long term to the Short term book.    

Tracy did do 4 brent crack options but there were no P&L from those yesterday.

I have tried to explain the short term book P&L below.. Pls let me know if you would like a more detailed breakdown of the pos.
There is no question that it will be a great help when Mark Jones comes over next week.  I will be the first to admit that
the workload the last two weeks, compounded by Miles Lidsey also being out, has been too much for me.  This desk should 
not be a one man desk which is what it has been since Tracy left.

John,

The book took a hit today and will take one again tomorrow.  Q4 N.W.E. has dropped $20 in the last week.  We have our storage tons booked
in Dec but they are completely flexible and can be sold at anytime.   The loss caused by the move in Q4 is therefore somewhat overstated 
as we are not restricted to sell the tons by a Q4 deadline.   I have a short naf pos in the front (sept/oct) and short  Mbel and  short WTI for q4
as a hedge against our swap pos in q4 and I am obviously trying like hell not to buy propane on EOL?..
Mark will start next Monday and that will help out.

I would also like to move Q2-02 frm the long term book  to the short book.  Last but not least the FOB contract in ras tarnura that we sold last yr 
at CP -3 and covered at +4 for the rest of this yr I would like to take the $280k loss now for the rest of 2001.

The book that is left after these moves is the book that I would like to make my Benchmark for the rest of the yr.  It is not a pretty P&L
and I understand that my future is directly linked to the year-end P&L (as it should be).   If I have not decreased the loss by Jan 2002 I
will consider it a failure and obviously face the consequences.

What do u think?

Bo/naf

---- Original Msg from: JULIAN MANN, DIRECT CAPITAL SECUR At:  8/29  9:45

A missionary who had spent years showing a tribe of natives how to
farm and build things to be self-sufficient gets word that he is to
return home.  He realizes that the one thing he never taught the
natives was how to speak English, so he takes the chief for a walk in
the forest.

He points to a tree and says to the chief, "This is a tree."

The chief looks at the tree and grunts, "Tree."

The missionary is pleased with the response.  They walk a little
farther and the missionary points to a rock and says, "This is a
rock."


Hearing this, the chief looks and grunts, "Rock."

The missionary is really getting enthusiastic about the results when
he hears a rustling in the bushes.  As he peeks over the top, he sees
a couple of natives in the midst of heavy sexual activity.

The missionary is really flustered and quickly responds, "Riding a
bike."

The chief looks at the couple briefly, pulls out his blow gun and
kills them.




The missionary goes ballistic and yells at the chief that he has spent

years teaching the tribe how to be civilized and kind to each other,
so how could he kill these people in cold blood that way?

The chief replied, "My bike."

Dear Mr. Rosenfeld,

Thank you for your email.  Those terms you've outlined below are agreeable to Enron. 

 In addition, there is no problem with title and the transfer of the title of the Puryear before, during, and after the merger of Dynegy and Enron.  It is now the property of Enron, and in not encumbered by the the merger. 

Please feel free to contact me if you have any other questions.

Regards,

Jeff Shankman

Dear Mr. Shankman,

Thank you for authorizing me to sell the Martin Puryear sculpture "Bower"
owned by Enron Corp. A major American museum has expressed serious interest
in purchasing this Martin Puryear sculpture and the museum has an
acquisition meeting early next week when they expect to make a decision
about the purchase.

The museum has certain budget restrictions and I have been asked to find out
if it would be possible to pay $500,000.00 this year and the $285,000.00
balance in October 2002. If this schedule of payment is acceptable, it will
make the acquisition of the Puryear likely.

The November 8th email authorizing me to sell the Puryear does not include a
term. Since I am in the midst of negotiating the Puryear's sale, I would
appreciate assurance that Michael Rosenfeld Gallery will remain the sole and
exclusive authorized  agent for the sale of the sculpture through the end of
2001. Also, in light of recent developments with the acquisition of Enron by
Dynergy, I would appreciate assurance that sale of the Puryear may continue
unobstructed and that there will be no problem with transfer of title.
Naturally, this is a very important point.

Thank you and I look forward to hearing from you.


Sincerely,
Michael Rosenfeld

David

At present we have we do not use them and have put a hold on anyone using them.

We talked to them but they refused to sign a non solicitation clause. 

Their principle in the Houston office is a guy called Lyndon Taylor - former Enron employee.

He called me today and has agreed to sign our non-solicitation clause - I think this is the preferrable strategy as Lyndon is well connected as a former Enron employee and this will take them out for 12 months. 

Given that he is prepared to sign up to this now means he may have not had any success in calling in.

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

Mike / Jeff - I will include this info in the QBR - but it will probably be easier to incorporate it into one of your presentations in electronic form.

Hi Jeffrey,

We met at the opening of the Contemporary Art Museum's opening of the Yoko
Ono exhibition, and I would be delighted to see you on my forthcoming trip
to Houston to lecture next week.

Would you be free for a quick chat the afternoon of September 12? I would be
interested in learning more about Enron's support of the arts and its ties
to Japan, and would welcome the chance to describe our activities to you.

Looking forward to hearing from you,

OK...
Sofa = $4290
Loveseat = $3300
8.25% tax = $626.18.
Total = $8,216.18.  Both w/out fabric.

You need a total of 23.5 yards of fabric.  I usually get about a 30-35%
discount on fabric so if you are OK with the couch prices, I can go to the
Decorative Center and get some fabric samples for you to choose from.  I
have no clue as to how much indoor/outdoor fabric goes for but I'll get a
range so that you can see the difference between the cheaper and expensive
type.  Let me know how you would like to proceed.
Thanks, Tina

Hi Tina,

Thanks for you help.

The site is www.thewickerworks.com.  Click on it to go directly there.
The are in Houston at Walter Lee Culp.  713 623 4670.

If you go to their web site go to the home page, then to the tab that
says wicker, then to the tab that says more.  The design is Helva.

I need 1 Helva sofa, and 2 Helva loveseats, of course in a very plain
off white (not tan as one of the pictures shows) indoor/outdoor fabric.

Or if you have any other ideas, let me know, of course.

Regards,

Attached please find the corporate allocations for the 2002 fiscal year that EIM will accept.  After unsuccessfully attempting to get some justification for the PROPOSED allocations from many of the various corporate groups, we have had to make a determination ourselves as to what we believe are reasonable charges for the value received from these groups.  This determination was based on several factors including, 2001 actual allocations, expected services provided to EIM, redundant services provided by other groups that are also performed at EIM, etc.

The attached charges are acceptable to EIM and will be used in the budget presentation to the office of the chair unless the allocating groups can come to an agreement with Kent Castleman of EIM as to a revision of these charges before such meeting.

 

Jeffrey McMahon and Ray Bowen

Hi John,

Anything I can do to accommodate you is fine with me, of course.  In addition, I will do everything I can to support you with the museum here.  I can't tell you how awful it has been here--and my morale has certainly been higher.  

Best regards,

  Hi Jeff,

Let me know when you are coming to London, so that I can be sure to be here
to show you the Knox cup and the new book by Steve Martin.

Since September 11, business has really dried up, mostly because my main
outlet is to Americans who are not travelling much at the moment.  So I
propose to send you a cheque for ?2800 within the next few days, or give it
to you when you come here, followed by a cheque for ?2500 in December and
one for ?2500 in January.   Total ?7800.   The last thing I was expecting
was you calling in your credit, and like all dealers I'm always trying to
keep my balance on the tightrope.   Let me know what you think.

In the meantime I have heard about the troubles at Enron, and I hope all
goes well for you.

John

Joe, 

I can only imagine that your experiences with diabetes helped more than we will know.  It was an extremely difficult situation, and I really wanted to thank you for your ability to recognize the situation.  Workplace incidents like this are very hard to manage on so many fronts.  Your help today is appreciated by everyone in EGM.

Jeff -

Jean and I wanted to say thanks for the beautiful flowers.  They continue to
brighten a niche in our kitchen.

I will be headed to SF and LA mid-week, so let me know what your schedule
looks like for next week-end.  Perhaps we can get together for a cocktail
then.

As you know we are still waiting for feedback from Pilot so we can move forward on taking a long term lease with Kinder Morgan's GATX tankage. Regardless of Pilot what tankage in Los Angeles, Houston and NY/NJ do we want to look at leasing for our own use? 

Carteret, NJ--they have a 260,000 barrel diesel tank available in 11 months. They could build two new 150,000 barrel tanks which would be available in 12-18 months. Looking for $0.35-0.38 per barrel per month.

Pasadena, TX--they have one 150,000 barrel gasoline/diesel tank that could be available by the end of this year and another 150,000 barrel gasoline/diesel tank available in 10 months. They also would be willing to build up to three 150,000 barrel diesel tanks which would be available in 12-14 months. Looking for $0.35 per barrel per month.

Los Angeles, CA--willing to extend our existing storage and also willing to build two 150,000 barrel and one 80,000 barrel tanks which would be available in 18-36 months. Looking for $0.50 per barrel per month. 

The key is that they are willing to not only free up existing tanks asap and give us first option on those tanks, but are also  willing to build new tanks in conjunction with the existing tanks, or would build the new tanks without taking the existing tanks. The clock is ticking on both the existing and yet to be built tanks, as they have several other customers looking for term tankage. Please let me know what, if any, tanks and term you are interested in looking at asap.

Doug:

FYI on our discussions and status by location...

*	Carteret:  At this moment all petroleum tanks are committed. We are
still working on potentially available assets for Enron which might come
available prior to "new build tanks" being available. More information will
follow in the next 30 to 60 days.

*	Pasadena:  As already discussed last week; we may be able to have
one 150,000 barrel tank in 4 to 5 months and a second 150,000 barrel tank in
about 10 months, assuming Enron is willing to make a 5 to 10 year commitment
and take the tanks as they come available. The tanks initially used may need
to be swapped out for distillate only tanks 12 to 14 months from now, or at
a later date. Tanks are being offered on a subject to availability basis,
until a firm commitment is actually agreed to by both Enron and KMLT. Please
advise Enron status regarding committing at Pasadena as soon as you are able
to.

*	LA/Carson:  Spoke with Packh Lorenz of KMP on the West Coast. KMP's
Los Angeles area assets (the Carson/LAHT facilities) are fully committed for
the forseeable future. Enron has commingled jet space and a dedicated
150,000 Barrel tank at Carson that could alternatively handle gasoline. This
is not a drain dry tank, so switching product would involve some expense.
To alternatively switch to diesel fuel from jet fuel would require a capital
investment in the $75,000 range (ballpark).  Packh is going to be meeting in
LA with Mike Phillips of Enron very soon.  Suggestion: Enron's 150MB tank is
leased through June of next year. You may want to consider having Enron
extend the term of this tank Agreement to 5 years, and also have Mike talk
directly to Packh about the capital associated with the diesel fuel storage
alternative.  This extension might help Enron in the interim period, while
"new build tanks" are also being discussed. I reconfirmed with Packh that
new tanks are at least 2 to 3 years away.  New tank commitments are
currently being lined up on several building phases. Enron's requirements
need to be firmly established so they can be incorporated as part of one of
the tank building phases. Please advise me when you are able to.

*	Tampa:  Steve Varnado of KMP is working on a commingled diesel quote
for Enron in Tampa (versus segregated new build tanks).  The quote will
include receipts by vessel, commingled tank space and outbound rack access.
Can you provide approximate monthly throughput volumes for the diesel fuel
Enron would want to bring into KMP-Tampa? This will enable us to finish the
quotation and provide it to you.

*	Knoxville:  TransMontaigne (TMG) owns a delivery terminal in
Knoxville.  It is on the Tennessee River, and is referred to as East
Knoxville.  It is the only terminal on the Tennessee River, however, it's
also the only terminal without pipeline access.  A few years ago, Colonial
was connected to this terminal, but shutdown the line (rather than repair
it), so the terminal has been isolated from pipeline access.  KMP is
progressing on the pipeline expansion project to Knoxville.  If Enron, or
someone else, purchases the feeder pipeline to TMG from Colonial and
re-activates it, KMP could potentially make a connection to that facility.
Our pipeline expansion into Knoxville is tentatively scheduled to be
complete by mid-year 2003.  While Enron is evaluating the above information,
should KMP send you its package regarding "pipeline volume commitments in
exchange for incentives" that KMP is going to offer to shippers on
Plantation Pipeline at the end of this month?

I hope this update is useful, and we look forward to your feedback. I'll be
travelling Wed through Fri of this week, but will be in the office next
Monday (cell phone 713-206-9438).

Best regards,

Bruce

Please see the attached list of Fantastic Friday and Super Saturday interviewers below.  As you will see we are still short of our targeted numbers for quality interviewers.  Given the economic climate and the perceived ability for us to recruit the best candidates, it is extremely important for our interview team to be the best of the best.  We still need your help in getting volunteers.  While prefering not to weight the interview team very heavily with Managers, I realize this is reality, especially on the November 15,16 dates because of the Management Conference.  Please re-poll your teams and provide more names for interviewers.  We would like to have this flanged up by Friday, October 12.  Thanks you again for all your help and participation.  Ted

The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Enron Corp. replaced its embattled chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fasto=
w, capping a tumultuous day in which the huge energy company saw its stock =
price again fall sharply and help pull down the share prices of other major=
 energy-trading companies.=20
Investors appeared worried that Enron's recent woes could have a destabiliz=
ing effect on the energy-trading market. The Houston energy powerhouse, wit=
h annualized revenue topping $150 billion and assets of more than $60 billi=
on, handles transactions representing roughly one-quarter of the nation's t=
raded-electricity and natural-gas volumes. In less than two years of operat=
ion, its EnronOnline trading platform has become a central marketplace for =
the energy business and already has handled more than $880 billion in trans=
actions.
"Enron makes the market. Make no mistake about that," said Merrill Lynch an=
alyst Donato Eassey. "There's not a trader out there that doesn't use Enron=
Online." As such, Enron enters into thousands of transactions every day in =
which the company's credit-worthiness is critical. Enron said its business =
operations were functioning normally yesterday. The company also has consis=
tently said it is financially strong and liquid.=20
Enron said its new chief financial officer is Jeffrey McMahon, the 40-year-=
old head of the company's industrial-markets division. His selection may be=
 intended, in part, to raise the company's credibility. People familiar wit=
h the matter say Mr. McMahon left his job as treasurer last year after voic=
ing concerns within the company about Mr. Fastow's role in running two limi=
ted partnerships that were involved in billions of dollars worth of transac=
tions with Enron. Internal partnership documents indicate Mr. Fastow and po=
ssibly a handful of associates made millions of dollars from the partnershi=
ps. Mr. Fastow severed his ties with those partnerships in July in the face=
 of increasing conflict-of-interest concerns being expressed by Wall Street=
 analysts and major Enron investors. On Monday, Enron announced that the Se=
curities and Exchange Commission was looking into the Fastow-related transa=
ctions.=20
While Enron as recently as Tuesday strongly defended Mr. Fastow, as well as=
 the company's dealings with the partnerships, controversy over those arran=
gements clearly played a role in the executive's departure. "In my continue=
d discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that rest=
oring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO," said Ch=
airman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay in a prepared statement.=20
Enron said Mr. Fastow "will be on a leave of absence from the company." He =
couldn't be reached for comment.=20
It remains to be seen how much Mr. Fastow's removal will assuage an increas=
ingly restive investment community. The action came after the 4 p.m. market=
 close and followed a day in which Enron's stock once again plunged. As of =
4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron shares were at $=
16.41, down $3.38, or 17%. It topped the Big Board's most active list at ne=
arly 76 million shares, more than twice the volume of the second-most-activ=
e stock. Several trades yesterday involved blocks of 800,000 shares or more=
, possibly indicating that some institutional holders are souring on Enron =
stock.=20
Enron's shares are down about 50% from the beginning of last week. Earlier =
this year, the stock was above $80 a share.=20
In an apparent ripple effect, the stocks of other energy-trading companies,=
 which do business with Enron, also fell sharply yesterday. For instance, D=
ynegy Inc. shares on the Big Board were off $5.45, or 13%, at $37.26. A num=
ber of the energy companies hit by the selloff have business strategies muc=
h different than Enron's, which rely heavily on complex and highly structur=
ed investment vehicles.=20
Prudential Securities analyst Carol Coale said Mr. Fastow's departure could=
 be seen as evidence that "management does care" about investor concerns. H=
owever, she adds, the move also could be viewed by some investors, coming a=
s it did two days after the announcement of the SEC inquiry, as "an admissi=
on of guilt." Ms. Coale yesterday issued a sell recommendation on Enron lar=
gely because of uncertainties about the company's extremely complex financi=
al structure.=20
Enron has consistently denied any wrongdoing in its Fastow-related dealings=
.=20
Worries and rumors about Enron's financial strength could be found in the s=
tock market yesterday. Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer said he heard =
people voice concerns about a possible "death spiral" in which increasing c=
redit concerns about Enron would decrease the number of people willing to d=
o business with the company, which would in turn weaken its finances and le=
ad to further business reductions. Mr. Fleischer, a longtime fan who still =
has a buy recommendation on the company, said he hasn't yet seen any eviden=
ce of such a problem.=20
However, Mr. Fleischer said, Enron needs to disclose more information about=
 its myriad of financial transactions with related partnerships and other e=
ntities. Enron is facing a problem with "trust and credibility. It's not ea=
sy to regain something as basic as trust," he said.

Enron Ousts Finance Chief As S.E.C. Looks at Dealings
By FLOYD NORRIS

10/25/2001
The New York Times
Page 2, Column 5
c. 2001 New York Times Company

The Enron Corporation, its stock battered by a sudden loss of investor conf=
idence, yesterday ousted its chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, who=
se involvement in complicated transactions with Enron has drawn the scrutin=
y of the Securities and Exchange Commission.=20
''In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear=
 to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy =
as C.F.O.,'' Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive, said in =
a statement announcing the change. Only one day before, Mr. Lay had told in=
vestors in a conference call that he and the Enron board ''continue to have=
 the highest faith and confidence in Andy.''
The company said that Mr. Fastow had taken a leave of absence, but it also =
named his successor, Jeffrey McMahon, the head of Enron's industrial market=
s group and a former corporate treasurer.=20
Enron said none of the officials were available for interviews last night.=
=20
The move came after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, wh=
ere Enron's shares fell $3.38, to $16.41. The price has been cut in half si=
nce Oct. 16, when Enron reported its third-quarter earnings. A $1.2 billion=
 reduction in shareholder equity brought on by ending some relationships wi=
th partnerships that Mr. Fastow had headed was not disclosed in the earning=
s news release. Mr. Lay briefly mentioned it in the conference call that fo=
llowed, but some analysts thought he was referring to a separate $1 billion=
 write-off that was disclosed in the earnings document, and were angered wh=
en they later learned about it.=20
On Tuesday, when both Mr. Fastow and Mr. Lay discussed the company with ana=
lysts on the conference call, neither was willing to discuss details of the=
 transactions between Enron and the partnerships formerly controlled by Mr.=
 Fastow. Mr. Lay cited the S.E.C. inquiry in declining to discuss the detai=
ls of the transactions.=20
The fact the transactions took place has been known for a year, but Enron's=
 disclosures have been widely criticized for being impossible to understand=
.=20
By structuring the deals as involving forward commitments to deliver Enron =
stock, it appears that Enron was able to assure that losses on them would n=
ot lead to reported losses, but instead to reductions of shareholder equity=
 that had no effect on the income statement. That is one of the issues the =
S.E.C., whose inquiries were disclosed Monday by the company, is expected t=
o address.=20
Concerns have also grown this week over whether Enron will face losses from=
 complicated financing strategies that kept billions of dollars of debts of=
f its balance sheet but left the company responsible for paying -- either i=
n cash or with stock -- if things went wrong. On Tuesday, Mr. Fastow assure=
d investors that the company ''expects to continue to have sufficient liqui=
dity to meet normal obligations,'' and said it had bank credit lines that w=
ere more than adequate.=20
Mr. Fastow was viewed as one of the architects, with Jeffrey K. Skilling, t=
he former Enron chief executive who resigned in August, of the change in bu=
siness strategy that turned Enron from a gas-pipeline company into a an ene=
rgy trading powerhouse that developed a large Wall Street following. Its st=
ock price peaked in the summer of 2000 at $90.75.=20
According to a person close to the company, while Mr. McMahon, Mr. Fastow's=
 successor, was Enron's treasurer, he told Mr. Skilling, who at the time wa=
s the chief operating officer, that he thought the partnerships involving M=
r. Fastow presented a conflict of interest. After that discussion, Mr. McMa=
hon moved to a different job at the company, this person said.=20
Shares of Enron traded as low as $15.51 yesterday afternoon, the lowest pri=
ce for the stock since early 1995, before recovering. In after-hours tradin=
g, they fell to $16.14.=20
One of the factors that hurt the stock yesterday was a decision by M. Carol=
 Coale, an analyst at Prudential Securities, to drop her rating to ''sell''=
 from ''hold.'' She had lowered the rating to ''hold'' from ''buy'' on Mond=
ay.=20
''After the S.E.C. inquiry was announced,'' she said in an interview yester=
day evening, ''Enron should have addressed it by delivering a scapegoat, as=
 a gesture to the Street. Now they are replacing him today. The timing is a=
 little late, but I think it will be received positively by the Street.''=
=20
But she said that investor sentiment might work the other way. ''People cou=
ld fear that if you remove Fastow from the management team, you'll never ge=
t any answers.''

Enron replaces CFO to reassure investors=20

In a bid to repair its badly damaged credibility on Wall Street, Houston-ba=
sed Enron Corp. removed its chief financial officer Wednesday, as federal s=
ecurities regulators review business dealings between Enron and two investm=
ent partnerships that he ran.=20
Enron, the world's largest energy trader, said Chief Financial Officer Andr=
ew Fastow had been put on a "leave of absence" for an undetermined period a=
nd named another Enron executive, Jeff McMahon, as his replacement. The com=
pany said the move was not a reflection on Fastow or a belief that he had d=
one anything improper.=20
"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear =
to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy a=

market closed on a day investors continued dumping shares.=20
Enron, which had seen its stock battered this year for a variety of reasons=
, found itself high on Wall Street's hit list after it released third-quart=
er earnings on Oct 16.=20
The earnings report drew renewed attention to something investors and analy=
sts had already expressed displeasure at: Fastow, with the approval of Enro=
n's board, had formed and run two investment partnerships -- LJM Cayman and=
 LJM2 Co-Investment.=20
The partnerships, which did complex financing and hedging deals with Enron,=
 served as a source of funding for Enron projects and investments.=20
But Wall Street questioned how Fastow could watch out for the interests of =
Enron's shareholders and the investment partnership at the same time.=20
So Fastow, in June, resigned his roles at the partnerships and Enron also e=
nded its relationships with the LJM entities. During the third-quarter, Enr=
on took a $35 million loss related to ending its LJM ties as well as a $1.2=
 billion reduction in shareholder equity.=20
Tuesday, Lay told analysts and investors that procedures were rigorously fo=
llowed to ensure the interests of Enron and its shareholders were protected=
 in dealings with the LJM partnerships. He said a "Chinese wall" existed be=
tween Enron and LJM.=20
Fastow's replacement, McMahon, previously served as Enron's treasurer befor=
e moving last year to another job with Enron. Most recently, he headed up t=
he company's industrial markets group. A source close to Enron said McMahon=
 asked to be reassigned from the treasurer's job because he was uncomfortab=
le with the Fastow-LJM setup.=20
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said neither Fastow nor McMahon was available f=
or comment Wednesday. He also didn't know whether Fastow is still receiving=
 a salary.=20
Enron disclosed on Monday that federal securities regulators had begun an "=
informal inquiry" into the LJM dealings.=20
The news proved terrible for a company already working to rebuild investor =
confidence after a series of failed investments in telecommunications, wate=
r and retail power businesses and the surprise resignation of CEO Jeff Skil=
ling in August for personal reasons.=20
A continuously growing number of shareholder lawsuits against Enron followe=
d the earnings report and the news of the SEC inquiry.=20
Wall Street has stepped up its chronic complaints that Enron's various fina=
ncial dealings are too complex to follow and that the company fails to give=
 analysts enough data to make proper evaluations.=20
Beyond the LJM partnerships, investors are concerned about two other partne=
rships Enron set up. Among the worries is that Enron will end up having to =
issue new shares of stock to cover commitments associated with those entiti=
es.=20
Investors wouldn't like that because it would dilute the value of current o=
utstanding shares. They are also afraid that Enron's debt credit rating may=
 be downgraded, which could have negative impacts on its overall business.=
=20
In the last six days, Enron's shares have closed lower and lower. On Oct. 1=
6, the stock closed at $33.84. On Wednesday it closed at $16.41, down $3.38=
.=20
Wednesday, the hubbub surrounding Enron also dragged down shares in other c=
ompanies that engage in energy trading, including Houston-based Dynegy, whi=
ch closed down $5.45 at $37.26. There is concern Enron's woes could in some=
 way end up harming the energy trading markets.=20
A conference call Lay and senior executives, including Fastow, held with an=
alysts Tuesday to help clear up questions didn't go as Enron hoped.=20
On Wednesday, Carol Coale, an analyst with Prudential Securities in Houston=
, moved from a "hold" to a "sell" rating.=20

FRONT PAGE - FIRST SECTION - Enron replaces finance chief - Energy company =
attempts to halt sharp decline in its share price.=20
Enron, the US energy group, yesterday replaced its embattled chief financia=
l officer, Andrew Fastow, to try to halt a slide in its share price, which =
has lost about 40 per cent of its value this week.
Kenneth Lay, Enron's chief executive officer, said after the market closed =
that Mr Fastow was taking a leave of absence. The move came a day after Mr =
Lay defended Mr Fastow amid questions about his ties to controversial partn=
erships that had forced Enron to take a $1.2bn write-off.=20
That loss, revealed last week, sparked the share sell-off amid concerns the=
re may be more bad news to come. Enron disclosed the loss during an October=
 16 conference call with analysts on its third-quarter results, saying the =
charge stemmed from closing funding mechanisms that Enron had set up in the=
 partnerships established with Mr Fastow.=20
Analysts say the charge has not been satisfactorily explained, leading to c=
onfusion among investors and an unofficial inquiry by the Securities and Ex=
change Commission.=20
"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear =
to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy a=
s CFO," Mr Lay said. He said Jeff McMahon, chairman and chief executive of =
Enron's industrial markets group, would replace Mr Fastow. Mr McMahon earli=
er served as Enron's treasurer.=20
Analysts said it was unclear whether Mr Fastow's departure would be enough.=
 Carol Coale, of Prudential Securities, said the move was positive in demon=
strating that Enron was being sensitive to Wall Street, which had called fo=
r Mr Fastow to be replaced. Yet, she added, it came three days after those =
calls.=20
Ms Coale issued a "sell" recommendation on Enron earlier yesterday, leading=
 to a drop of almost 18 per cent in its share price. "We are concerned abou=
t what we don't know," Ms Coale said. She was concerned that Enron might ha=
ve to sell assets below book value to maintain its credit rating, or be for=
ced to issue equity to bolster its balance sheet. Enron might also lose cus=
tomers to competitors that were not under such pressure.=20
Enron believes such concerns are misplaced and the SEC inquiry will prove t=
he company has done nothing wrong. Lex, Page 16.=20

To lose a chief executive may be regarded as a misfortune. To lose the chie=
f financial officer as well looks like carelessness.
Enron's effort to increase transparency, revealing more operating data in i=
ts third quarter release, was undermined by its decision to gloss over a $1=
.2bn equity charge related to the closing of "related party transactions" w=
ith two off-balance sheet financing vehicles. And it neglected to mention t=
hat the vehicles were run by Andrew Fastow, its CFO. Conflict of interest a=
nyone?=20
The Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting an informal inquiry. I=
nvestors, angry after the initial revelation, had reason to feel more so af=
ter its conference call, which was supposed to clear up confusion over the =
financing vehicles and related party transactions. The call had the opposit=
e effect.=20
The charge to shareholders' equity, and the related reduction in notes rece=
ivable, was the result of closing one of the vehicles - and the termination=
 of previously recorded contractual obligations to deliver Enron shares. Th=
e uncertainty is whether Enron might have to sell assets or issue new stock=
 to cover possible shortfalls in other vehicles. Credit concerns and lack o=
f disclosure explain the weakness of stock and bond prices. Enron is unlike=

Enron Corp. Cut to `Market Perform' at Banc of America

Baring Asset Management's McClen on Enron: Investor Comments
2001-10-25 08:09 (New York)

     London, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg) -- The following are comments by
Catherine McClen, who helps manage about $17 billion of bonds for
Baring Asset Management, about Enron Corp.

     Yesterday, Enron ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow
amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into
partnerships he ran that cost the largest energy trader
$35 million. McClen said Baring bought credit-linked notes issued
by Houston-based Enron during the summer.

     ``Given what has happened, with them basically firing Andy
Fastow, the CFO, they've finally woken up to how concerned people
are about the management-credibility issue.'' On a recent
conference call ``no one thought they did themselves any favor in
terms of calming investors' concerns.''

     ``They were slightly hiding behind the fact that the SEC has
got this inquiry going. The fact that two days later Andy is gone,
and he was in the center, is a good sign that the company is
realizing just how concerned investors are.''

     ``There's always that worry once the SEC gets involved that
it could extend. You never know what could come of that.''

     ``There is a bit of fear of the unknown about Enron now, with
the SEC inquiry and the risk that there could be further asset
write-downs.''

     ``Another thing they're criticized for is their lack of
disclosure. We still haven't seen a balance sheet for the third
quarter.''

     ``People are saying, why don't you include a balance sheet
with your results? They promised better disclosure in the past and
that was meant to begin in the third quarter.''

     ``You'd like to see just more information on asset write-
downs and a discussion of their off-balance-sheet financing -- all
these vehicles they have like Marlin and Osprey.''

     ``We'd like to see some clarity, answering those sort of
questions.''

     ``It seems as though Enron at least are maybe at the start of
a process where they're going to address and clean up their
balance sheet and they've started to replace management.''

     ``Investors have already had enough issues'' in corporate
bonds recently and ``sometimes investors just think, `Not another
nasty in my portfolio,' and I'd rather exit.''

     ``For certain investors maybe they just get scared. I wanted
to know more about it. People had speculated if it could go to
junk. I don't think they could because I don't think Enron could
exist as a junk company.''

     ``There's a certain reluctance'' to sell the bonds. ``You
want to stand back for a moment and look at the fundamentals.''
     ``When the spreads have already moved out that wide you have
to reassess and see whether you think it's a buying opportunity.''

Enron ousts CFO amid partnership questions
By PAM EASTON
Associated Press Writer

Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

HOUSTON (AP) - Enron Corp. may have added another question to the list inve=
stors already have by ousting its chief financial officer a day after the c=
ompany stressed its confidence in Andrew Fastow amid a Securities and Excha=
nge Commission inquiry.=20
"It could either be viewed as a positive step toward easing investor concer=
n or it could be interpreted as if Enron removed the CFO at the request of =
the SEC," Prudential Securities Inc. analyst Carol Coale said Wednesday. "W=
ho knows?"
Enron officials hope it will result in increased investor confidence after =
the energy trading giant's stocks have declined in value each day since Mon=
day's announcement that the SEC had inquired about partnerships that did bu=
siness with Enron while they were managed by Fastow.=20
"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear =
to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy a=
s CFO," Enron chief executive officer Kenneth Lay said after markets closed=
 Wednesday.=20
Fastow will take a leave of absence from the company while Jeff McMahon, wh=
o has served as chairman and chief executive of Enron's Industrial Markets =
group, takes over his role.=20
"I think change is good at this particular point in time," said FAC Equitie=
s analyst Robert Christensen said. "I think Andy was somewhat beleaguered."=
=20
A.G. Edwards & Sons analyst Mike Heim, however, said it will take more than=
 replacing Fastow as chief financial officer to clear the uncertainty loomi=
ng in the financial world about Enron and its partnerships.=20
"I think the reason why the stock has been declining so sharply the last fe=
w days is due to a lack of clarity on the partnership arrangements," Heim s=
aid.=20
Replacing Fastow alone won't clarify those arrangements, he added.=20
"There is still uncertainty despite promises by management to be more trans=
parent to the financial community," Heim said. "Instead of being more trans=
parent there is more confusion than ever."=20
Enron's stock continued to plummet Wednesday, closing down $3.38 to $16.41 =
per share, a 17 percent decline.=20
Since the Wall Street Journal first reported on the partnerships last week,=
 Enron's stock price has slid nearly 52 percent.=20
"The market was asking for that to happen," J.P. Morgan analyst Anatol Feyg=
in said of Fastow's departure. "This is really the first time Enron has act=
ed as an agent of the shareholder in this crisis."=20
Previously, Enron's managers have been "cautious and defensive in their app=
roach," he said.=20
During a conference call Tuesday to address investor concern, Lay said the =
partnerships were fully disclosed and contained measures to ensure no confl=
ict existed as Fastow carried out the dual roles. The partnerships have sin=
ce been dissolved.=20
The call didn't work for many, including Feygin and Heim.=20
"I didn't hear things like we've unrolled all these partnership dealings or=
 here's all the exact details of how the partnerships work or we don't ever=
 expect to take any more charges," Heim said. "What I heard is we don't hav=
e to disclose that information until the 10-Q is filed."=20
The turbulent past few months which have included the SEC inquiry, third qu=
arter losses and the August resignation of the company's chief executive of=
ficer, Jeff Skilling, have left many analysts questioning the company's fut=
ure, Heim said.=20
"It's really a speculative bet right now, but the odds favor the company be=
ing able to weather the storm and being a healthy company if not a year fro=
m now, two years from now," he said.=20
But much is going to depend on how much Enron discloses to its investors, F=
eygin said.=20
Feygin said McMahon worked as Enron's treasurer for two years under Fastow =
before a disagreement over Fastow's involvement in the partnerships caused =
McMahon to leave his job as treasurer.=20
"Internally, Jeff was always a proponent of Andy not being involved in (the=
 partnerships)," Feygin said. "Three days ago I would have said there is no=
 need for a change at the CFO level. Today, it was pretty obvious it was so=
mething Enron needed to do."

Facing a crisis of confidence in the market, Enron Corp. replaced its chief=
 financial officer yesterday as its stock continued to tumble.=20
After failing to rally the support of analysts in a damage-control conferen=
ce call Tuesday, the Houston-based energy trader dropped chief financial of=
ficer Andrew Fastow, who has been linked to transactions being looked at by=
 the Securities and Exchange Commission. He was replaced by former treasure=
r Jeff McMahon.
The move came after Enron shares (ENE/NYSE) dropped US$3.38 to US$16.41. Th=
e stock has dropped 55% in the past two weeks -- wiping out US$10-billion o=
f shareholder wealth.=20
"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear =
to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy a=
s CFO," Enron chief executive Kenneth Lay said.=20
Early last week, Enron reported a US$618-million third-quarter loss, result=
ing from US$1.01-billion in write-offs.=20
The company also disclosed a US$1.2-billion reduction in shareholder equity=
 for the quarter as a result of terminating certain transactions related to=
 a partnership that for a time was headed by Mr. Fastow.=20
In July, Mr. Fastow ended his connection to the partnership in the face of =
growing concerns by analysts and major investors. The SEC is currently look=
ing into the partnership arrangement.=20
The turmoil of the past several days prompted Enron to schedule a conferenc=
e call Tuesday morning with Wall Street analysts to reassure investors.=20
During the call, Enron officials declined to specify Mr. Fastow's role in t=
he partnership, citing the ongoing SEC investigation and a derivative lawsu=
it filed against Enron that alleges its board breached its fiduciary duties=
 by allowing Mr. Fastow to create and run the partnerships.=20
The stock came under renewed pressure early in the day after analyst Carol =
Coale of Prudential Financial downgraded the stock for the second time this=
 week, to "sell" from "hold." Ms. Coale said the rating change is "not beca=
use of things we do know but because of things that we potentially don't kn=
ow about the company."=20
Volume was very heavy, with 75.8 million shares changing hands. Average dai=
ly volume is 6.7 million shares.=20
J.P. Morgan analyst Anatol Feygin was also less than impressed with Enron's=
 line during the conference call.=20
The company acknowledged that transactions with partnerships run by its chi=
ef financial officer led to a writedown of US$1.2-billion in shareholder eq=
uity. But Mr. Feygin said management was "defensive" when pressed for detai=
ls.=20
Ms. Coale reduced her price target down US$15 from US$55, assuming more bad=
 news was to come.=20
While the allegations of impropriety cloud Enron, Mr. Feygin said the compa=
ny's credit situation could be the more crucial factor for its short-term f=
ortunes.=20
Last week, Moody's Investors Service placed all US$13-billion of the compan=
y's long-term debt securities on watch for possible downgrade. If Moody's l=
owered its rating, Enron's short-term debt costs would rise.

Shell-Shocked Enron Parts With CFO

Enron's (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) problems won't go out the door with =
Andrew Fastow.=20
The finance chief, who was replaced Wednesday, came under scrutiny as the e=
xecutive who orchestrated and profited from a hedging deal that went sour, =
saddling Enron with a $1.2 billion charge to equity. As details of this dea=
l, and others, have emerged over the past two weeks, Enron stock has collap=
sed, falling 54% in just seven days.=20
Wednesday, the stock fell a further 17% on enormous volume, signifying that=
 once-faithful mutual fund holders were bailing. Also Wednesday, a raft of =
once-friendly analysts downgraded the stock. Faced with betrayal on that sc=
ale, Enron management at last felt compelled to act; a press release says F=
astow is taking a leave of absence. He's been replaced by Jeffrey McMahon, =
formerly CEO of Enron's industrial markets group.=20
How might the Enron bulls spin this? Likely, they will point to McMahon's a=
lleged opposition to Fastow's role in the big hedging deal, called LJM2, to=
 show that the "Fastow era" is over. The Wall Street Journal, citing anonym=
ous sources, reported Tuesday that as treasurer at Enron McMahon complained=
 about Fastow's possible conflict of interest. Probably, the fear was that =
Fastow couldn't serve Enron and LJM2 equally, especially as he was allegedl=
y making a lot of money from LJM2.=20
Clearly, if McMahon turns out to be a new broom, that's a positive for Enro=
n. An Enron spokeswoman declined to comment on whether The Journal's accoun=
t of McMahon's stance on LJM2 was correct.=20
Not much else is encouraging, however. Fastow's departure shows that it too=
k massive drops in Enron stock to force senior management into action. On a=
 difficult conference call Tuesday, CEO Ken Lay gave Fastow resounding back=
ing. It took Wednesday's plunge to get Lay to sign off on a new CFO. In oth=
er words, Lay listens only when the market screams and hollers. How much fu=
rther does the stock have to fall to bring further much-needed reforms at t=
he company?=20
The spokeswoman responds that Lay had discussions with analysts Tuesday and=
 Wednesday that led him to the conclusion that Fastow's replacement was nec=
essary to rebuild investor confidence.=20
Enron culture is thick with financial sorcery. People got upset by one shad=
owy deal, but no one knows exactly how the company's core energy trading bu=
siness makes money. It's hard to believe the LJM2 deals were done in isolat=
ion and without the knowledge of the board.=20
In fact, the chatter is that Fastow and former CEO Jeff Skilling proposed t=
he LJM2 transactions to the board after it was reluctant to enter the broad=
band business. The board apparently feared the volatility that might come f=
rom being in broadband, so Fastow allegedly proposed LJM2 as a way to hedge=
 that volatility away. This meant LJM2 entered agreements that gave it acce=
ss to increases in the value of broadband assets but protected Enron from t=
he downside. Should the whole board be on the hook, too? The spokeswoman re=
sponds that the board would not have entered the LJM2 transaction if it had=
 not thought it would benefit Enron and its shareholders.=20
Lay has shown himself to be woefully out of touch with the market's views. =
Arguably, that's downright reckless for a trading company that is dependent=
 on potentially skittish short-term financing. Letting things get this bad =
has risked good faith among Enron counterparties and bankers. It shows an u=
nhealthy reluctance to address key problems until they're unavoidable. The =
spokeswoman responds that the company is now working hard to improve transp=
arency.=20
Any efforts in that direction will be much appreciated, but is it any wonde=
r people compare this lot to Long Term Capital Management?=20

Did Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) cause the energy crisis? Did it cr=
eate a short squeeze in energy by buying up all available power and hoardin=

Somehow, I believe that if it weren't for the events of Sept. 11 and its af=
termath, these questions would be asked right now by a Justice Department a=
ntitrust division or a Congressional investigation. To me, this one smells =
worse than anything that Microsoft might have done at one time.=20
And we need to give some of these departed Enron execs immunity to get to t=
he bottom of what may have been the greatest antitrust act in history.=20
We ought to do it fast, too, while there is some Enron left to pay the treb=
le damages that violators owe.=20
What surprises me is that some enterprising young prosecutor doesn't want t=

This nation must stop at nothing to get the terrorists. But it can't abando=

There was just too much money lost too fast for what, in an era where energ=

I just received a call from the Venezuelan Ambassador.  He said he did everything he could to squeeze in some time with Chavez next week, but that Chavez's revised itinerary (he's leaving a day earlier and arriving half a day later than originally scheduled) has resulted in the ambassador's being asked to take a few things off the schedule to loosen things up, and he can't accommodate our request. He was apologetic and offered to assist us in trying to make arrangements for a Caracas meeting.  Sorry this didn't work.  Let me know if you guys would like me to pursue this further on the London end.

Jim,

I will make my self available for a meeting if it can really happen.  This is very difficult for me do pull off but I'll be there if he can meet.  I am very skeptical that he would have a meeting to tell us that our project is dead or let us vent our frustration of wasting several years and $15 million putting together this project.

I'll be traveling for the rest of the week, please leave me a voicemail with any updates.

Thanks,
m

Clay Harris and I met with the Venezuelan Ambassador this afternoon and reiterated our interest in arranging a meeting for Enron with President Chavez, who will visit the UK during 21-24 October.  The ambassador responded initially that Chavez's schedule had been "set for months" and that changing the schedule would be difficult.  After further discussion, he said Chavez would certainly be interested in discussing the project, and that they might be able to make time on the schedule at about 1100 hours on Tuesday 23 Oct.  We provided a brief overview of the status of the project, and he asked that we provide as soon as possible names and bio information for whoever would meet with Chavez if this comes off.  He promised to get back to us as quick as he can.  Please let us know who will be available from Houston for a possible Tuesday morning meeting here.  Thanks.

Tomorrow is the final day to schedule December barrels, and we are currently short 1,220,000 barrels.  We have exhausted all measures of buying crude including: settling sales financially, buying from companies where we have short positions, and selling physical puts.  As a group, we have reduced our short physical position from over 10 million barrels to 1.2 under extremely difficult credit terms.  We believe we cannot cover the remaining 1.2 without prepaying a counterparty.  This requires a cash infusion of approximately $22,631,000 (1,220 X $18.55/barrel). 

Every effort will be made within the next 24 hours to reduce this position, but the outlook is not bright.  Please let me know as soon as possible what can be made available to us.

Sincerely,

Rob Fuller

I've got 2 samples of fabric.  1 plain off white and the other a ribbed off
white.  Elizabeth and I prefer the ribbed.
Plain = $40 retail / $20 cost
Ribbed = $50 retail  / $25 cost x 34 yards = $850
I'll give them to you at cost so that we can continue furnishing your house
( I hear it's empty).
If you have time this afternoon and can walk down to your Lobby I can meet
you there to show you the fabrics.  Also, bring down a check so that I can
stop by Walter Lee Culp and order you couches and fabric ma?ana.  Fabric can
be overnighted if needed or sent 2 day.
I think 2 day is plenty of time.

50% now - (not including taxes)
50% later + shipping and taxes when couches are ready for delivery (6-8
wks.).

Need now
$5445 for 2 loveseats and 1 couch + $850 for fabric = $6295
I will give you a receipt.
Let me know when you can see the fabric........

   and maybe I can show you over coffee that afternoon.  I'll need to order
   the
   fabric so add another 2 weeks at least before the store gets it.  Also,
   I'll
   find out paying conditions but usually is 50% upfront (cash) and then
   the
   other 50% when ready for delivery.  They don't take credit card.  Checks
   payable to me and I pay with my company check.
   I'll get moving and call you on Friday.
   Sound good?

   Holy cow this is expensive.  Of course I don't care about your 5% or so,
   but what is the retail on these babies?  I'm pretty flexible on the
   fabric--mid range would be fine.  Let's move ahead.  (2 loveseats

   not 1)  How long did they say?

      OK...
      Sofa = $4290
      Loveseat = $3300
      8.25% tax = $626.18.
      Total = $8,216.18.  Both w/out fabric.

      You need a total of 23.5 yards of fabric.  I usually get about a
   30-35%
      discount on fabric so if you are OK with the couch prices, I can go
   to
      the
      Decorative Center and get some fabric samples for you to choose from.
   I
      have no clue as to how much indoor/outdoor fabric goes for but I'll
   get
      a
      range so that you can see the difference between the cheaper and
      expensive
      type.  Let me know how you would like to proceed.
      Thanks, Tina

      Hi Tina,

      Thanks for you help.

      The site is www.thewickerworks.com.  Click on it to go directly
   there.
      The are in Houston at Walter Lee Culp.  713 623 4670.

      If you go to their web site go to the home page, then to the tab that
      says wicker, then to the tab that says more.  The design is Helva.

      I need 1 Helva sofa, and 2 Helva loveseats, of course in a very plain
      off white (not tan as one of the pictures shows) indoor/outdoor
   fabric.

      Or if you have any other ideas, let me know, of course.

      Regards,

      Jeff

Jeff,
 
Mark Tawney indicated that, while it might be a long shot, Lynda might be interested in a core group of people (smaller than all EJ obviously) that would be able to help her build a weather business in Japan.  Do you think there is any merit in this?  If so, let me know the best way to progress, including, if you have it, her phone number.

Mr. Shankman:

Thank you for getting back to me.

My interests lie in trading commodities and derivatives.  I know that Enron
is very much behind the move to commoditize many products and trade them
over electronic exchanges and feel that this is a strong position for the
digital future.  I think what Enron is doing is exciting and I would like to
speak with you about it and the opportunities it opens up to a person such
as myself.

It is nice to know that the Wharton alumni community is strong all over the
world.  If you have a few minutes, I would certainly appreciate the
opportunity to introduce myself to you.  Thanks again.

Sincerely,

Robert Brown

Mike asked me to send the following message to each of you to see if you have any interest in obtaining tickets for The Masters next year.  Mike plans to discuss The Masters at the staff meeting on Monday and he wanted each of you to have an opportunity to think about your group's interest in The Masters prior to the meeting.

Thank you.

Enron's Sports Marketing Group is reviewing proposals from outside vendors for the 2002 Super Bowl and The Masters.  In order to negotiate the best possible customer entertainment packages, I need to determine the interest level within EA, EIM and EGM for participation in these two major sporting events.  On behalf of your perspective companies, please let me know if you are interested in participating and if so, how many spaces you will require for each.

Once we determine the interest level corporate-wide and we negotiate the costs, a detailed outline of these events will be distributed to each of you for your final approval.
Thank you for your assistance.

Greg, David,

While I think you guys have come to some conclusions about layoffs, it is the people we need to keep we need to address now.  We will provide you a list of those that are crucial to keep going forward.

I am extremely concerned about one person in particular--Rob Fuller.  I have done everything I can over the last weeks to make sure he knows we are committed to him, however market rumors are that he could be close to leaving.  We now have to commit to him with dollars on a piece of paper, and any help you can provide tomorrow would be helpful.  I don't think this is a next week issue.

Shanna, I will coordinate with you on the HR front to get Oxley's feedback.

Thanks for your attention.

Subject: Enron Stock held in escrow

Dan - below is a brief outline of the numbers on my Enron stock currently held in a Citibank escrow account.  There is probably more here than you need, so feel free to make changes or let me know how you want me to redraft.
 
 
Background Info:
 
-At Webmodal/Enron merger closing (March 2, 2001), I was paid $1.3 million cash and $2.0 million in Enron Stock or a total of approximately $3.3 million for my Webmodal shares.
 
-The $2 million Enron stock was purchased at an average price of $70 (approx 28,570 shares).  Specifically, cash was wired to a brokerage account set up by me; used to purchase Enron shares on the open market (I was given, like 10 days to do this per the merger agreement); and then the shares were transferred to a Citibank escrow account.
 
-The Webmodal/Enron merger agreement required me to do an 83b election (for personal income taxes) on all of the consideration ($3.3 million in cash and stock) that I received for my Webmodal shares.  This made the $2.0 million (march '01 value of stock held in escrow), as well as the $1.3 million cash, taxable as 2001 income.  The 83b election was intended to reinforce the reality that the $3.3 was being paid as consideration for the sale of my Webmodal shares to Enron and was not wage income, even though the release of $2.0 of the $3.3 million was tied (through the escrow agreement) to my ongoing employment at Enron for the 3 years following the merger.
 
-Per the escrow agreement between myself and Enron, 1/3 of the stock is released to me on March 2 of '02; another 1/3 on March 2 of '03; and the final 1/3 on March 2 of '04.  Also per the escrow agreement, all of the stock is immediately released to me if my employment at Enron is involuntarily terminated by Enron.  Finally, any stock remaining in escrow would be returned to Enron in the event that I elect to voluntarily terminate my employment with Enron prior to March 2 of '04 (some exceptions to this if my contract isn't renewed or if my job materially changes, etc.)
 
Current Conundrum:
 
-The market value of the approximately 28,571 shares held in escrow is $143,000 at $5 per share ($257,000 at $9 per share).
 
-If the price had held at $70 per share (what I paid back in March for the shares held in escrow), I would have received stock worth approximately $677,000 in March of '02.  This was presumably Enron's intent at the time of the merger.
 
-If I resign before the end of the '01 tax year, I would forfeit the shares held in escrow but benefit from a $400,000 personal income tax savings as a result of realizing an '01 loss (through forfeiture) on ENE shares with a tax basis of $2.0 million.  In other words, the rather large tax bill that I created in March when I took an 83b election on all of the consideration (cash and stock) received for my Webmodal shares would be substantially reduced.  Ironically, the $400,000 value that I could realize upon immediate resignation is over two times the value of the shares scheduled to be released over the next three years.
 
-Enron's release of the 28,500 shares held in escrow to me before 12-30-01 would allow me to produce substantially the same tax benefit (from selling the shares before year end '01) and would allow me to realize a value that is at least in the same neighborhood as the year 1 intended consideration at the time of the merger.

Does anyone else see any irony in this guy's name?  I swear I did not modify this in any way.



PERSPECTIVES
A tale of greed and hubris
Waldo Proffitt

11/18/2001
Sarasota Herald-Tribune
All
F2
(Copyright 2001)

For anyone not already disenchanted with the idea of total deregulation of public utilities, the most recent installment of the miserable Enron story as it unfolded last week should serve as a convincing example of the folly of relying on unregulated profit- driven enterprises to supply our energy. 
A year ago Enron was the darling of Wall Street, the poster boy for the utility industry, its stock selling for about $85 a share. Last week its stock was worth about 10 percent of that and the company had agreed to be bought by a competitor. There was fear the company's bond rating might fall to the "junk" level.
What happened? It will take months, if not years, to untangle the details, but it is clear that the main culprit was greed, closely followed by hubris. 
Not too many years ago Enron was a small, struggling, gas pipeline company in Houston. As deregulation spread to more and more states, Enron began acquiring pipelines, gas producers and utilities. 
It also acquired friends in high places, especially the Bush family and their key political advisers. And, it discovered it could make money faster by selling and trading energy than by producing it. Enron sold many of its generating plants and became the biggest "power broker" in the nation. 
Though it was by no means the largest winner in the con game that bilked California consumers of tens of billions of dollars, Enron was one of the first power barons to take advantage of California's flawed deregulation law -- virtually written by in-state and out-of- state utility companies. 
The California fiasco soured (probably) most Americans on utility deregulation, but Enron was not singled out for calumny, and management saw no reason to examine its business ethics. 
Contrarywise. management had visions of even greater profits, which it felt no obligation to share with ordinary stockholders. The chief financial officer and other high-ranking executives set up affiliated or subsidiary partnerships which made deals with Enron. I do not understand the details of these arrangements, but neither do independent accountants, the Securities and Exchange Commission or congressional investigators. It does seem clear that the Enron insiders made millions for themselves. 
Enron acknowledges, without explaining, that stockholder equity dropped $1.2 billion in the last quarter and that it had for the last five years overstated profits by some $600 million. Whether this was by design or by mistake is in dispute, but it is the sort of thing which tends to undermine the confidence of investors. 
So much for greed. Back to hubris. It seems not unlikely that Enron's leaders felt they might not be punished for a modest amount of corner-cutting because they had friends in high places. 
The chief executive, Kenneth L. Lay, was and is a personal friend of George W. Bush and has easy access to the White House. For many months after the new administration took office, Karl Rove, Bush's top political strategist, owned Enron stock valued at $100,000 to $250,000, and sold it only after he had been able to secure a ruling that he did not have to pay capital gains tax immediately because he sold to avoid a conflict of interest. Lawrence Lindsey, the president's chief economic coordinator, and I. Lewis Libby, Vice President Cheney's chief of staff, owned stock in Enron, and Lindsey was paid $50,000 last year as a consultant for Enron. 
Enron and its employees gave more than anyone else to Bush's four political campaigns -- one (unsuccessful) for Congress, two for governor and one for president. In 2000, Enron and its employees gave $113,000 to Bush's campaign, $250,000 to the Republican National Committee, and $300,000 to the Presidential Inauguration Committee. 
Cabinet appointments affecting energy policy, key sub-Cabinet appointments, administration action or inaction in the California energy mess, and the overall energy policy of the administration could hardly have been more favorable to the interests of Enron. 
And now a couple of questions: Is it possible the unusual financial maneuvers by Enron went unnoticed or even unsuspected by all the savvy Texas oilmen in the Bush administration? Were those of them with heavy investments in Enron unconcerned about the conduct of the company? Was Enron right in thinking its friends in government would not be in a hurry to investigate or to reprimand? 
Or, in light of our preoccupation with terrorism, will the Enron case get much attention from the federal government? Or from voters?

   I've got 2 samples of fabric.  1 plain off white and the other a ribbed
   off
   white.  Elizabeth and I prefer the ribbed.
   Plain = $40 retail / $20 cost
   Ribbed = $50 retail  / $25 cost x 34 yards = $850
   I'll give them to you at cost so that we can continue furnishing your
   house
   ( I hear it's empty).
   If you have time this afternoon and can walk down to your Lobby I can
   meet
   you there to show you the fabrics.  Also, bring down a check so that I
   can
   stop by Walter Lee Culp and order you couches and fabric ma?ana.  Fabric
   can
   be overnighted if needed or sent 2 day.
   I think 2 day is plenty of time.

   50% now - (not including taxes)
   50% later + shipping and taxes when couches are ready for delivery (6-8
   wks.).

   Need now
   $5445 for 2 loveseats and 1 couch + $850 for fabric = $6295
   I will give you a receipt.
   Let me know when you can see the fabric........

      Retail for couch is $5460 (saving $1170 about  27% lower)
      Retail for loveseat $4200 (saving $900 about 27% lower.)
      I may be able to save you more on the fabric if I can find the one
   you
      need
      at Kravets since they give me 50% off.  The majority of the furniture
      stores
      only give between a 20-30% off.  The couches take about 6-8 weeks if
      they
      are in stock and usually are.  I'll get some fabric this Friday
   during
      lunch
      and maybe I can show you over coffee that afternoon.  I'll need to
   order
      the
      fabric so add another 2 weeks at least before the store gets it.
   Also,
      I'll
      find out paying conditions but usually is 50% upfront (cash) and then
      the
      other 50% when ready for delivery.  They don't take credit card.
   Checks
      payable to me and I pay with my company check.
      I'll get moving and call you on Friday.
      Sound good?

      Holy cow this is expensive.  Of course I don't care about your 5% or
   so,
      but what is the retail on these babies?  I'm pretty flexible on the
      fabric--mid range would be fine.  Let's move ahead.  (2 loveseats
      though,
      not 1)  How long did they say?

         OK...
         Sofa = $4290
         Loveseat = $3300
         8.25% tax = $626.18.
         Total = $8,216.18.  Both w/out fabric.

         You need a total of 23.5 yards of fabric.  I usually get about a
      30-35%
         discount on fabric so if you are OK with the couch prices, I can
   go
      to
         the
         Decorative Center and get some fabric samples for you to choose
   from.
      I
         have no clue as to how much indoor/outdoor fabric goes for but
   I'll
      get
         a
         range so that you can see the difference between the cheaper and
         expensive
         type.  Let me know how you would like to proceed.
         Thanks, Tina

         Hi Tina,

         Thanks for you help.

         The site is www.thewickerworks.com.  Click on it to go directly
      there.
         The are in Houston at Walter Lee Culp.  713 623 4670.

         If you go to their web site go to the home page, then to the tab
   that
         says wicker, then to the tab that says more.  The design is Helva.

         I need 1 Helva sofa, and 2 Helva loveseats, of course in a very
   plain
         off white (not tan as one of the pictures shows) indoor/outdoor
      fabric.

         Or if you have any other ideas, let me know, of course.

         Regards,

         Jeff

Guys,

Attached is a resume from a guy I used to office with at McKinsey named Richard Saettone (Say-tone).  He has an oil and gas background (Belco Petroleum, McKinsey clients Pemex, et. al.) and extensive M&A experience.  Originally from Peru and has a lot of practical business experience in Latin America (ran a 4-country retail business and two commercial banks).

I mentioned that I would pass this on to EGM - feel free to folllow up directly if interested.

Rob

I am very tired too, but I had a lot of fun. Please let me know when you have mood to do it again, and we should keep the place "secret". Last night's dinner was cancelled, so I didn't get the chance to send out the invitation to your party today. Have you made the decision to fly or drive to see your parents? When you get back, let's plan a Enron Wharton party.
 
All the best!
 
Li

Subject:	PETROCHEMICALS UPDATE

Thought it was about time for an update on Petchems, what has happened and what is happening.

FINANCIAL PRODUCTS

First trades in Europe done on  financial swaps  for Polypropylene, Low Density Polyethylene and Propylene.
USA continues to increase volumes dramatically on Benzene Toluene and Xylene driven by Steve and Adam. New business in the USA on Propylene and LLDPE.
Year to date we have transacted 790,000 tonnes of financial deals for the Petrochemical industy globally.
Already transacted Cal 02 benzene swap with Dupont USA.
USA olefines has been targeted for increase in deal flow Q3/Q4.

OPTIONS
Enron's first Benzene options transacted in Europe. 

EOL
Styrene swap now launched in Europe and the USA one to follow soon.
4 new counterparties transacting.

NEW HIRES/PERSONNEL
I have interviewed 1 person ( Marathon employee) with a view to running our fledgling USA distribution business and "ghosting" the traders on Styrene, Toluene and Xylene.
We are in the process of interviewing a physical trader for London.
I expect Chris Shapland in Europe will be trading financial petchems in London by the return of the year and a junior replacement for him will then be required.
Rob Brewis is making great progress on market penetration and I expect to be trading physical olefines by Q4 in Europe.
USA Plastics group still needs a trader.

FUNDAMENTALS
Work is underway on the Europe web site. An analyst for this work is being sort. Meanwhile Chris is helping in the interim.

PROJECT WORK
Meeting with CONOCO Europe set for  Sep 4 to discuss taking all their Benzene and Propylene output either physically or financially.

Recent discussions with NCT ,a Dutch plastics distibutor, proved very interesting. Idea is to take a share in the company to have access to their physical exposure on Plastics/Polymers in Europe with a view to providing a new source of physical supply to NCT and manage their total price exposure fro their total sales volume. NCT turnover is c $91m. 

Push on Propylene in Europe seen as the most attractive Olefin for Q4.

USA Aromatics dist business on Toluene ready to go.

Major interest from USA majors in Cal 02 Styrene and Benzene swaps.

PHYSICAL BUSINESS
Last but not least I almost forgot ,somehow we still keep very active on physical transactions across the whole range of products . With the hopeful addition of 2 new people we will be increasing our prescence in USA and Europe.

Hope this was useful.

Thanks

Stuart

Hello Jeff,

Kevin McGowan has cancelled as second day interviewer at Wharton.  I was wondering if you had anyone that could spare us time or anyone in mind I could contact?

Thanks for the help.

Strike began at midnight, the first one in 6 years. It
is concentrated in the Campos Basin, which produces
about 80% of Brazil's petroleum.  Unless there is progress, 
workers intend to stay out until Sunday. 
Union said 70% of workers out.

Effects on Oil Production

On its first day, the strike of Petrobras workers
caused a drop of 60.2% in oil production, according to
the state-run company. Wednesday's output was 550,000
barrels, compared with 1.383 million on Tuesday. At
the Campos Basin (responsible for 80% of national
crude output) production plunged 76.2%, to 250,000
barrels from 1.050 million, according to Petrobras.
Production also dropped in Espirito Santo, Rio Grando
do Norte, Bahia and Alagos.

Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper reported that
distribution terminals Alemoa, Sao Caetano, Sao
Sebastiao, Guararaema, Guarulhos and Barueri, all in
Sao Paulo state, were paralyzed. In Rio de Janeiro
state the Macae and Governor's Island terminals were
stopped. Other terminals on strike were Vitoria and
Alagoas, according to Folha.

The United Oil Workers Federation, which represents 20
unions and 35,000 workers, said that the strike caused
production in the Campos Basin to decline 85% on
Wednesday. The union said that 37 out of 38 platforms
are paralyzed, pumping only natural gas. The union
said that crude production fell to 156,000 barrels
from 1.045 million barrels in the Campos Basin.
Production in other locations was slowed 70% to 80%,
according to the union.

Refined Products
According to union, only 2 out of 11 refineries (Minas
Gerais & Rio Grande do Sul) are still running.
Petrobras said that its 11 refineries produced 1.76
million barrels of gasoline on Wednesday; the union
gave no figure.  Petrobras' 2000 Refinery statistics are posted at
http://www2.petrobras.com.br/portal/ingles/frame_ri.asp?pagina=/ri/ingles/destaques/des_abastecimento.stm

Natural Gas

O Globo newspaper of Rio and O Estado newspaper of Sao
Paulo both said that natural gas production fell 34.2%
to 25 million cubic meters from 38 million cubic
meters.

Negotiations

Petrobras demands that strikers return to work at nine
platforms in the Campos Basin, to guarantee natural
gas production, and five others to prevent leakage as
a precondition to resuming negotiations Thursday
morning, Brazilian newspapers reported Thursday. The
union said it would take the issue to striking workers
and would give an answer Thursday morning.

According to Brazilian news reports, the company is
holding a second round of talks with the union. First
round earlier in day was fruitless. The union says
they want to see a better wage proposal than before if
they want workers to keep operations running at a
minimum.

Subject:	EnronOnline- Change to Autohedge

Effective Monday, October 22, 2001 the following changes will be made to the Autohedge functionality on EnronOnline.

The volume on the hedge will now respect the minimum volume and volume increment settings on the parent product. See rules below: 

?	If the transaction volume on the child is less than half of the parent's minimum volume no hedge will occur.
?	If the transaction volume on the child is more than half the parent's minimum volume but less than half the volume increment on the parent, the hedge will volume will be the parent's minimum volume.
?	For all other volumes, the same rounding rules will apply based on the volume increment on the parent product.

Please see example below:

Parent's Settings:
Minimum: 	5000
Increment:  1000

Volume on Autohedge transaction			Volume Hedged
1      - 2499							0
2500 - 5499							5000
5500 - 6499							6000

Dear Mr. Shankman,

last Friday our new show

"2 Painters - 2 Sculptors: Johannes H?ppi, Nikolaus List - Thadd?us H?ppi, Marcus Weber"

was opened with great success. All visitors - including some curators - where enthusiastic about the show and the works. Many works where already sold at the opening reception.

Unfortunately we where not able to update our website properly until yesterday. Now, all information (images, exhibition view, press release etc.) are on the site. If you visited our site and if you where wondering about the little information about the show, a revisit is a good idea.

The pages about the show are linked directly from our start page at:

http://www.galerie-haus-schneider.com

We also would like to inform you, that we will participate at the following artfairs:

ART COLOGNE: 31.October - 4.November.2001
Booth 1.1. A 14

ART ATHINA (Athens, Greece): 22.November. - 26.November.2001

We will send you another newsletter about our participation at those fairs in the next weeks.

Warmest regards,

Heinz-Martin Weigand
Galerie Haus Schneider

Jim,

I will make my self available for a meeting if it can really happen.  This is very difficult for me do pull off but I'll be there if he can meet.  I am very skeptical that he would have a meeting to tell us that our project is dead or let us vent our frustration of wasting several years and $15 million putting together this project.

I'll be traveling for the rest of the week, please leave me a voicemail with any updates.

Thanks,
m

Eric:

Clay Harris and I met with the Venezuelan Ambassador this afternoon and reiterated our interest in arranging a meeting for Enron with President Chavez, who will visit the UK during 21-24 October.  The ambassador responded initially that Chavez's schedule had been "set for months" and that changing the schedule would be difficult.  After further discussion, he said Chavez would certainly be interested in discussing the project, and that they might be able to make time on the schedule at about 1100 hours on Tuesday 23 Oct.  We provided a brief overview of the status of the project, and he asked that we provide as soon as possible names and bio information for whoever would meet with Chavez if this comes off.  He promised to get back to us as quick as he can.  Please let us know who will be available from Houston for a possible Tuesday morning meeting here.  Thanks.

Jim

As you know, we are about to reduce EMG workforce by over 45%.  I have spent the last couple of weeks spending one on one time with  many, many employees who are not dealing well with the recent events, and who are anticipating the worst for themselves and their families.  I certainly commend the company on an orderly process, but we need to make our professional counciling staff more visible, and remind employees that this important service is available.

I cannot stress enough how poor morale, etc, is over here, and anything we can do to help will be greatly appreciated by the employees.

Regards,

Jeff

Crown incident at Pasadena damaged the central piping rack which goes to all other processing units. However, none of the processing units were damaged except for the one involved in the fire which was the first stage of an amine unit (lpg treater) removes H2S. Plant is still down, no estimate on when it may restart.

Jeff -

If you'd like to get together to have a drink and talk about something other
than work, give me a call.

Jean's got a meeting at school tonight, but other than that we should be
around all weekend.

If Ed releases the piece, it will be to our gallery. Thank you for
your offer to pay in advance, but it isn't necessary.

Would love to hear more about the Enron collection. Are you
collecting very much photography?

I'll be in touch.

Ada

Enron's Sports Marketing Group is reviewing proposals from outside vendors for the 2002 Super Bowl and The Masters.  In order to negotiate the best possible customer entertainment packages, I need to determine the interest level within EA, EIM and EGM for participation in these two major sporting events.  On behalf of your perspective companies, please let me know if you are interested in participating and if so, how many spaces you will require for each.

Once we determine the interest level corporate-wide and we negotiate the costs, a detailed outline of these events will be distributed to each of you for your final approval.
Thank you for your assistance.

Subject:	US Responds to Terror #5
Importance:	High


Afghanistan Ground War

We believe plans are progressing for ground action in Afghanistan to begin over the next week. Rumsfeld and Bush are both overseas and it is unlikely that the attack would commence prior to their return.  Forces earmarked for deployment include US Marines, US Rangers and British Marines. The Pentagon has reportedly suggested to London that it reclassify its marine commandos and paratroopers as "special forces" so the operation may still be depicted as an SF one. 

The tactical aims of such operations - which will see troops inserted by helicopter from Pakistan and then extracted via the same route - will be to destroy identified Al Qaeda targets in areas theoretically under Taleban control. 

Anthrax

More incidents today with media outlets and politicians being the primary targets.  There is a wide variety of media reporting on this, most of it unreliable.  We reiterate that the U.S. government is equipped to handle isolated incidents of cutaneous anthrax exposures, but is not equipped to handle air-dispersed anthrax attacks on a wider scale, or more contagious biological weapons such as smallpox.  The main impact of the current incidents (aside from those directly affected) is psychological; a further escalation of the sense of worry, which increases both political and economic pressure on the Bush Administration.  Politically, there will be increased pressure "to do something" not only against the bin Laden network, but possibly Iraq. Economically, the anthrax incidents are simply another serious blow to consumer confidence. The Congressional incidents also are delaying passage of the fiscal stimulus package.

Terrorist Sophistication Targeting Critical Infrastructure Not to be Overlooked

The anthrax incidents also represent yet another attack against US critical infrastructure.  Just as the World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks represented attacks on our transportation infrastructure, financial infrastructure, and government infrastructure, so too do the anthrax attacks target our government infrastructure (Congress, Gov. Pataki) and our communications infrastructure (Fox/CBS/ABC/NBC & mail delivery).  Both the September l1th attacks and the anthrax incidents have hit targets that are significant both as critical infrastructure and as symbols of American power.  The threat at Three Mile Island reported last night suggests that the possibility of attacks against energy infrastructure should certainly not be ignored and should probably be expected.

Jeff -- 

As you probably know, we maintain a pretty rigid policy as it relates to providing market perspectives to wire services.  Matt has explained to me the commercial reason for his desire to respond, and it seems logical to me.  Also seems like a relatively benign response.  Problem is, getting Palmer's attention on this given the other urgent issue facing the company today is tough, and I want to be sure you are on board with this before I try to squeeze it into his agenda.  I don't feel that I should authorize anyone to talk to the wires today without telling Mark because of what's going on.  

Bottom line question: Would you like to see Matt provide this response to Bloomberg? 

Thanks

Hey Mark

Here's my take on an aspect on one of the fundamental drivers of the API's from last week (the API's lag by a week):

I think that we should see a slight increase in imports due to the fact that LOOP has seen some more activity this last week vs. 2 week's ago.  LOOP, the only US site that can receive ULCC and VLCC's without lightering, was down for 3 days 2 week ago due to weather delays.  Last week, LOOP experienced delays again, but only for 2 days.  Given this fact and the large amount of tonnage that docked at LOOP last week, it looks like imports will increase following unusually large decline of last week.  I would tend to mitigate any increase in imports with the understanding that weather was bad again in the gulf, so discharge rates were probably reduced at most terminals.  

To sum it all up, I would say that imports should increase in tomorrow's API data to account for the previous week's decline, however I am reluctant to believe that they will catch up fully from last week's precipitous decline.  The mitigating factor will be the continuing discharge delays caused by bad weather in the Gulf.

  

Hope that helps, if you have any questions let me know.

i was planning a meeting in portland to discuss a couple of new deals and i would need to have 3 people (inluding me) fly out there next week.  the only fares are around $2k.  given the new expense policy, i wanted to see if you would have any problems with that.  i am typically very frugal with travel and always assess the cost-effectiveness.  the deals have about $1m value and will be more likely to close in person.  i need to know by end of today.  thanks.

i also have a 1-sheet strategy brief that i wanted to go over w/ you & mike earlier.  we should come back to that now.

Fitch Places Marlin Water Trust II & Osprey Trust I on Rtg Watch

Fitch Places Marlin Water Trust II & Osprey Trust I on Rtg Watch Neg

Fitch-NY-October 26, 2001: Fitch has placed the ratings of
Marlin Water Trust II's (Marlin II's) approximately $915 million
senior secured notes due 2003, and Osprey Trust's (Osprey's)
approximately $2.4 billion senior secured notes due 2003 on
Rating Watch Negative. The Marlin II notes and the Osprey notes
are currently rated `BBB'. This rating action follows the
placing of Enron Corp.'s ratings on Rating Watch Negative by
Fitch.

The rating of the Marlin II notes is supported by an overfund
account (pre-funded interest) and equity commitment from Enron
in the form of mandatorily convertible preferred stock. The
overfund account is invested in Enron debt securities (rated
'BBB+', Rating Watch Negative), with payments used to service
interest to noteholders. Payment of principal ultimately relies
on Enron's obligation to remarket mandatorily convertible
preferred securities. Fitch currently rates Enron's preferred
securities 'BBB-', Rating Watch Negative. In addition, the
transaction also benefits from rights under a $125 million loan
to Azurix Europe Limited, rated `BBB+' by Fitch.

Similarly, the rating of the Osprey I notes is based on the
support from the assets in the share trust used to support
interest payments and an equity commitment from Enron to
remarket mandatorily convertible preferred stock to fund
principal payments. The mandatorily convertible preferred stock
has been issued and is being held in the share trust. The assets
in the share trust supporting interest payments include Enron
unsecured obligations (the overfund account) as well as
quarterly dividend payments on the mandatorily convertible
preferred stock.

While various sources of repayment exist, such as sale or
liquidation of the underlying assets or an equity offering, in
each case primary credit support is derived from the Enron
obligation to remarket mandatorily convertible preferred stock
if an amount sufficient to repay the notes has not been
deposited with the trustee the 120-day prior to the maturity
date, which is one of the Note Trigger Events. In the event that
the issuance of the preferred stock yields less than the amount
required to redeem the senior notes, Enron is required to
deliver additional shares. If Enron cannot or does not deliver
on this obligation, subject to certain standstill periods, then
the amount of the deficiency becomes a payment obligation of
Enron, representing a general unsecured claim. Additional Note
Trigger Events include a downgrade of Enron's senior unsecured
debt below investment grade by any of the major rating agencies
in conjunction with specified declines in Enron's closing stock
price over three consecutive trading days, as well as customary
events of default under the notes. It is important to note that
Enron has not verified that the underlying assets have adequate
market value to fully pay down the associated debt.

Fitch will continue to monitor these transactions in conjunction
with the ratings of Enron, Corp. and will update investors as
appropriate.


Enron's Debt Falls As Company Draws Down On Bank Loans

10/26/2001
Capital Markets Report
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp.'s (ENE) bond and bank debt was quoted lower early Friday following the Houston energy giant's decision Thursday to draw down about $3 billion on its bank loan facilities. 
Late Thursday, Enron said it had taken action to dispel uncertainty in the financial community. Specifically, the company said it drew on its committed lines of credit to provide cash liquidity in excess of $1 billion.
Enron's 6.4% bonds which come due in July 2006 were hovering just below 80 cents on the dollar, down from around 82 cents on Thursday. 
Trading activity in investment-grade bank debt like that of Enron's isn't as active as the market for leveraged loans made to companies with less than investment-grade ratings. But fixed-income sources noted some offers Friday for Enron's bank debt at around 94 cents on the dollar, still well-above distressed levels. They add that banks may want to try to sell Enron's bank debt, which is now funded following the drawdown, but at a coupon that was negotiated several months ago. 
That was well before Enron ran into its current market turmoil. Last week, the company reported a $618 million third quarter loss and $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity. The company has said that the Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting an inquiry into transactions it did with Andrew S. Fastow, its former chief financial officer who was replaced on Wednesday. 
Moody's Investors Service rates Enron's senior unsecured debt at Baa1, though it's on review for a possible downgrade. Fitch Inc. and Standard & Poor's both rate the debt triple-B-plus. Fitch also has Enron's debt on review for a possible downgrade, while S&P changed Enron's credit outlook to negative from stable. 
Enron's stock was trading at around $15.87, down 48 cents at around 12.20 p.m. EDT. 
Among the Enron bank debt that comes due in May 2002 is a $1.75 billion 364-day commercial paper backstop facility. The company also has a $1.25 billion revolving facility that's due in April 2005, according to Loan Pricing Corp. in New York. 
One distressed debt investor said some of the bank debt comes with a low coupon of around 55 basis points over the London Interbank Offered Rate. 
Banks, the investor said, "are funding it and not getting paid for the risk at Libor plus 55, even though it comes due in May '02," the investor said. 
Another fixed-income official said that trading desks may start to kick the tires on Enron's bank debt, given the run of fallen angels, or investment-grade companies that have been downgraded to below investment-grade status, within the last year. Among such companies are Lucent Technologies Inc. (LU) and Xerox Corp. (XRX) 
"As soon as banks have a piece of paper they never expected to be funded, it really changes their perception and some just want to get this stuff off their books," this person said. 
Some banks, though, may not be active seller of Enron's debt given that banks' business with big investment-grade companies is relationship-driven. 
"Banks are not very quick to pull out of a relationship like that," the fixed income official said.

Enron Sues Microsoft Over Failed Broadband Services Deal
By Michael Rieke
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

10/26/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- In a July conference call with analysts when Jeff Skilling was still chief executive of Enron Corp. (ENE), he threw out a ray of hope for his company's foundering broadband business. 
Enron Broadband Services had just signed a long-term deal to provide bandwidth for MSN, Microsoft Corp.'s (MSFT) online Internet service, Skilling said. Enron would give more details on the deal later.
After three months without farther word on the deal, Enron has broken its silence by suing Microsoft. 
In a suit filed Thursday in the district court of Harris County, Texas, Enron claimed Microsoft has failed to live up to terms of the deal. 
The agreement, signed June 25, called for Enron Broadband to develop and provide network capacity and other services to support Microsoft's offering of high-speed Internet service, according to the lawsuit. 
Microsoft was required to develop an electronic ordering and billing system for use with all regional Bell telephone companies during an initial phase of the deal, according to the lawsuit. 
Microsoft has failed to provide that system and other items required in the deal, so Enron isn't required to deliver operational broadband services for the deal, the lawsuit said. 

Microsoft sent Enron a letter dated Oct. 23 saying that if Enron didn't provide an operational broadband system by Oct. 25, Enron would have breached the contract, the lawsuit said. Microsoft then would be entitled to recover damages. 
The suit also said Microsoft failed to provide monthly subscriber growth forecast required by the deal. 
In a third breach of the contract, the suit claimed, Microsoft made public announcements about the subject of the agreement without getting Enron's prior approval. 
An Enron official told Dow Jones Newswires that Microsoft had issued a press release Oct. 15 about the service but that Enron wasn't mentioned in the release. 
A Microsoft news release dated Oct. 15 announced what the company calls MSN 7, a new version of the MSN network which includes high-speed, or broadband, access to the Web. The service was to be available on Oct. 25. 
The Microsoft release said MSN 7 would deliver "state-of-the-art" video and audio through "dramatically improved" broadband technology. The new service would extend MSN broadband service "to more than 29 million households in 45 markets." 
By the end of the first quarter of 2002, the Microsoft release said, the MSN broadband service would be available to more than 90% of U.S. households capable of using high-speed digital subscriber line access. 
The Enron lawsuit asked that Microsoft be declared in breach of contract. It also asked that Enron be allowed to recover unspecified damages as well as costs stemming from the lawsuit. 
Neither Enron nor Microsoft have responded to requests for comment on the lawsuit. 
The Microsoft deal is the second failed broadband agreement. In July 2000, Enron and Blockbuster Video, a unit of Viacom Inc. (VIA), announced a deal to deliver movies over the Internet. 
That deal fell apart in March of this year when Blockbuster said Enron's fiber-optic network couldn't deliver the service on a dependable basis. Enron countered that Blockbuster couldn't deliver the quality and quantity of movies needed for a successful video-on-demand service.

ENRON UNIT TAKES HEAT POWER GROUP SAYS ENERGY FIRM FAILED BOND REQUIREMENTS
Jeffrey Krasner, Globe Staff

10/26/2001
The Boston Globe
THIRD
C.1
(Copyright 2001)

The retail sales subsidiary of Houston energy giant Enron Corp. faced expulsion last week from the New England group representing power generators, marketers and distributors. The sales unit had failed to meet bonding requirements intended to protect market participants and the group itself from unpaid bills. 
ISO New England, which operates the power grid throughout the six New England states, urged Nepool, the power industry group, to "initiate termination proceedings" for Enron Energy Services Inc., according to a letter obtained by the Globe.
An Enron spokeswoman yesterday said the company had satisfied Nepool's requirements, and blamed the threatening letter on a series of administrative oversights, including the failure of ISO New England to warn Enron of previous instances when the bond fell below required levels. 
"It was an administrative snafu," said Peggy Mahoney, a spokeswoman for Enron. "It's fixed. It's no big deal. We didn't get the paperwork in [on time] because it got sent to the wrong desk. It was taken care of on Friday." 
According to the letter, a Nepool participant faces termination if it has failed to meet its bonding requirements three times over the previous 12 months. "Having three defaults to trigger that letter does not happen frequently," said Ellen Foley, an ISO New England spokeswoman. In the letter, ISO's chief financial officer, Edward McKenna, said his organization "has been in contact with Enron Energy Services through multiple telephone communications, and to date the financial assurance has not been cured." 
But Mahoney said Enron never received written notification of its previous "financial assurance" defaults, which were corrected almost immediately. Therefore, she said, the company was unaware that the current default was the third, which begins the expulsion proceeding. In addition, she said, the current default notice was sent to the wrong person, creating the delay that resulted in the letter. "We're working with ISO New England to figure that out," she said. 
The recommended termination is an embarrassment to Enron because the firm's director of state government affairs, Daniel W. Allegretti, is the chairman of Nepool's Participant Committee, which organizes and oversees the major membership meetings in the organization. 
"This is not that unusual within the pool," said Allegretti. "I frequently receive notices of technical defaults." As far as posting the new bond to correct the situation, he said, "We were two and a half days late in submitting paperwork." 
The incident also comes at a particularly sensitive time for Enron. The parent in Houston has been the subject of a financial scandal in which the firm's chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, is accused of profiting from partnerships he oversaw that engaged in billions of dollars of transactions with Enron. The Securities and Exchange Commission is probing those transactions, the company said Monday. Enron placed Fastow on leave Tuesday and installed a new CFO. 
Enron's stock has plunged amid ongoing revelations about the partnerships and their impact on the company's financial strength. The company reduced shareholder equity by $1.2 billion after terminating transactions by one of the partnerships that had been headed by Fastow, according to The Wall Street Journal. Enron lost $618 million in the third quarter. 
Yesterday, Enron's shares closed at $16.35, down 6 cents, on volume of 39.1 million shares.

FRONT PAGE - COMPANIES & MARKETS: Enron's explanations fail to quell critics' concerns 
Financial Times; Oct 26, 2001
By JULIE EARLE and SHEILA MCNULTY

Enron has put up a page on its website of "frequently asked questions" in response to a barrage of analysts' enquiries following last week's controversial results announcement. 
Unfortunately, the US energy group's critics have not been satisfied with the answers. Nor has Wednesday's decision to replace Andrew Fastow, its chief financial officer, quelled all investors' concerns about its highly complex financial affairs. 
However, analysts are pleased that Kenneth Lay, chief executive officer, is distancing the group from Mr Fastow and his ties to controversial financing vehicle "partnerships". "It is a step in the right direction and we are happy to see them move," says Ronald Barone of UBS Warburg. "It's not the end of it." 
The shares, which have tumbled since last week's results, ended a shade lower yesterday, off 0.37 per cent at Dollars 16.35. But analysts warn that the shares will continue to languish well below the 52-week high of Dollars 84.87 until the group improves its transparency. 
One of the frequently asked questions following Enron's results announcement on October 16 concerned "a Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 840m) reduction in shareholders' equity". The Dollars 1.2bn was not explained in the news release on the results, but mentioned in passing by Mr Lay in a follow-up conference call. Many analysts confused it with a Dollars 1.01bn charge in the earnings report. 
It has since been called a "loss" and a "write-off" and Enron's staff have struggled to explain it in plain language. 
Enron's official position now is that the reduction in shareholders' equity related to a structured finance vehicle in which LJM, a private equity fund formed by Mr Fastow, was an investor. When the decision was made to terminate these vehicles, Enron "recorded a Dollars 1.2bn reduction in shareholders' equity and a corresponding reduction in receivables. These adjustments were the result of Enron's termination of obligations to deliver Enron shares in future periods". 
The confusion over the Dollars 1.2bn has further undermined the credibility of Enron, which is now the subject of an unofficial inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Analysts were upset they did not know the adjustment was in the offing and note that it could be seen as increasing the group's debt ratio, which might hurt its debt rating. 
Mr Lay held an analysts' meeting to counter charges that Enron was not transparent. But this ended with demands for daily calls with outside auditors to explain its accounts. "I find the disclosure is not complete enough for me to understand and explain all the intricacies of these transactions," said Goldman Sachs' David Fleischer. 
Other analysts are also concerned about potential further write-offs. Salomon Smith Barney's Raymond Niles points to Enron's investments in its Dabhol Indian power plant, its South American investments, and its remaining telecoms assets. Most importantly, he says, they may include several of Enron's other off-balance-sheet vehicles. 
"Frankly, we have not been able to get enough information on them to evaluate whether there is a problem with them," Mr Niles says. Other US energy traders have been distancing themselves from their rival. El Paso said it was facing "a lot of questions on its accounting practices".

Enron Bonds Fall as Company Taps $3 Bln Credit Line (Update3)
2001-10-26 14:26 (New York)

Enron Bonds Fall as Company Taps $3 Bln Credit Line (Update3)

     (Adds Egan-Jones lowering credit rating in 12th paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. bonds and shares
fell after the company failed to reassure investors its bond
rating wouldn't be lowered and tapped a $3 billion credit line
because it can no longer borrow in the commercial paper markets.

     Enron's stock has fallen 52 percent in the past 10 days after
investors questioned the company's transactions with affiliated
companies run by its former chief financial officer. The stock
fell 45 cents to $15.90 in early afternoon trading today.

     ``People are questioning the credibility of management,''
said John Cassady, who helps manage $3 billion of fixed income
assets at Fifth Third Bancorp. ``It looks like the guy who was
supposed to do everything for the benefit of shareholders was
running partnerships for the benefit of himself.''

     Enron is shut out of commercial paper markets, where short-
term loans carry lower rates than banks offer. The company will
use its credit line to pay off $2.2 billion in commercial paper it
has outstanding, Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said.

      The company's 6 3/4 percent bonds which mature in 2009
declined 1 1/2 points to a bid of 84 cents on the dollar and an
offer of 86 cents. At that price, the bonds, which carry a rating
of ``BBB+,'' yield 9.53 percent.

     Enron's shares have dropped as investors grew concerned that
the company's credit rating will be cut after $1.01 billion in
third-quarter losses from failed investments. Enron needs good
credit to raise cash daily to keep trading partners from demanding
collateral and to settle transactions.


                         Dilution Concerns

     Though Enron's bonds have investment-grade ratings, their
yield at current prices is higher than those of industrial bonds
that carry junk ratings. According to Bloomberg data, companies
with ``BB'' ratings pay on average 9.16 percent to borrow for
seven years.

     A lower credit rating may also force Enron to buy back
holdings in other partnerships with its stock, diluting the value
of Enron investors' stock.

     Partnerships called Whitewing, Marlin and Yosemite own Enron
assets they bought with borrowed money. Enron sold the assets to
the partnerships to keep debt related to them off its books. The
partnerships plan to repay the borrowed money by selling the
assets.

     If Enron loses investment-grade rating, the borrowed money
comes due earlier, leaving less time for the partnerships to find
the best price for the power plants and other assets. Enron would
have to make up any shortfall between what the assets would sell
for and the amount of the debt.

     One way would be issuing common shares in exchange for Enron
preferred convertible shares held by the partnerships. That would
thin out the holding of every other investor.

     Of the two main bond rating companies, Moody's Investors
Service has the company on watch for possible downgrade, and
Standard & Poor's lowered Enron's long-term credit outlook to
negative. Egan-Jones Rating Co. today lowered its rating on
Enron's debt to BB+, one notch below investment grade, from BBB-.

                         Other Liabilities

     Enron's liabilities associated with the partnerships amounts
to at least $3.3 billion, the company has said.

     Enron ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow on
Wednesday amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into a
partnership he ran that cost the company $35 million in direct
losses. Enron also bought back 62 million shares from the
partnership, reducing shareholder equity by $1.2 billion.

     Jeff McMahon, head of Enron's industrial markets group, was
named CFO in a bid to restore investor confidence, Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay said in a statement.

Weiss & Yourman Law Office Announces Class Action Lawsuit Against Enron Corp.

10/26/2001
Business Wire
(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 26, 2001--A class action lawsuit against Enron Corp. ("Enron" or the "Company")(NYSE:ENE) and certain of its officers and directors was commenced in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, on behalf of purchasers of Enron securities. If you purchased Enron securities between January 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, please read this notice. 
The complaint charges the defendants with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The complaint alleges that defendants failed to disclose material adverse information and misrepresented the truth about the Company and caused plaintiff and other members of the Class to purchase Enron common stock at artificially inflated prices.
This action seeks to recover damages on behalf of defrauded investors who purchased Enron securities. Plaintiff is represented by Weiss & Yourman, a law firm possessing significant experience and expertise in prosecuting class actions on behalf of defrauded shareholders in federal and state courts throughout the United States. Weiss & Yourman has been appointed by numerous courts to serve as lead counsel in class action lawsuits and in that capacity has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars on behalf of investors. 
If you purchased Enron securities between January 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, you may move the Court no later than December 21, 2001, to serve as a lead plaintiff of the class. In order to serve as a lead plaintiff, you must meet certain legal requirements. A lead plaintiff is a representative party that acts on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. In order to be appointed lead plaintiff, the Court must determine that the class member's claim is typical of the claims of other class members, and that the class member will adequately represent the class. Under certain circumstances, one or more class members may together serve as "lead plaintiff." Your ability to share in any recovery is not, however, affected by the decision whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff. You may retain Weiss & Yourman or other counsel of your choice to serve as your counsel in this action. 
If you wish to receive an investor package or if you wish to discuss this action, have any questions concerning this notice or your rights or interests with respect to this matter, or if you have any information you wish to provide to us, pleas

Dear Equity,

Good morning,

Much like the Yankee's last night, there are some signs the economy may
pull out a bottom of the ninth inning win.  Our surveys are up to just
about where they were before 9/11, the auto survey is strong on incentives
and is now joined by the retail survey, M3 has surged $158 billion, the
market is up about 11% from 9/11, and now Tom Gallagher and Andy Laperriere
expect the new stimulus package to be as much as $100 billion.  

The EMM today highlights the positives and of course the negatives as well.
 The three main concerns: falling commodity prices, a surge in layoff
announcements, and corporate earnings (or lack thereof).  But we still
expect inflation to slow quite a bit, and this coupled with oil and rates
falling, plus very low inventories should make for a good 2002.  I would
say that we are basically looking for a "lower case 'v.'"

In the political report, look for more on why Tom and Andy expect $100
billion in new stimulus, versus $75b.  This brings the total stimulus to
$225 billion in 2002.  Also, don't miss the "in depth" section on
Healthcare.  There is a good possibility the Medicare drug benefit never
happens.

Finally, I resisted all last week and I just can't hold back any longer.  I
would like to congratulate Ed, who received top ranking for the 22nd
straight year from Institutional Investor.  Nancy was also mentioned, and
very exciting, our political research group took number one for the first
time.  Congratulations.  And thank you!  They couldn't have done it without
the fans.

Have a great week.

So far this quarter we've spend about 18 million on a reserve that Randy Petersen/Credit are making us take on an option we have associated with the MTBE project.  In essence, Randy P doesn't understand how we trade options at Enron, and I'll be having a conversation with Rick about this.  We've spent almost 5 million in getting out of physical positions since no one will buy from or sell to us.  We can't manage the physical positions and obligations we have since there is no money available to the crude group (to purchase physical or post LC's in the case of a sale).  Wev'e also spent about 10+ million closing down books and getting out of positions as the market gives us the chance.  More than half the books have been closed and we will close/consolidate four more tonight.  As you know, getting out of any positions costs money, and the market smells blood.

Because the crude and products markets have been moving significantly recently, we can't manage our options position by getting out of them.  Again, nobody will buy from us or sell options to us, so we have to try to neg. gamma trade it.  

That is the 30 second version of the cluster I'm trying to close, hope it helps.

So, can we change the severance program as I've outlined?

As you guys go through working up a severance program, I started thinking about some equity issues.  If the average tenure of an employee at Enron is about 3 years, why not come up with 2 plans--1 for long serving employees who have been long dedicated to the company, and a second one for the more recently hired?  It doesnt' make sense to me that someone who has been here under a year at $100,000 base should be entitled to 11 weeks even before they sign the waiver.  I would also not change the program in whatever form you ultimately settle on for the longer serving employees, rather just scale back the program for the newer employees.

   It

      I was wondering if you might be able to help me.  I need to finish
      strong
      this year.  I am attempting to reach the goal of $336,000 in clothing
      sales
      by the end of the year.  Obviously, no single client will be able to
      help me
      do this.  So I was wondering if you might be able to help me out by
      giving
      me the names of some qualified gentlemen or ladies that might be
      interested
      in the type of service we offer.

      Some things to consider:

      We offer ready-made (off the rack) clothing as well as custom.
      We offer all types of men's clothing including casual.

      If you know of some mid to upper level executive women, they may have
   an
      interest as well.

      Some memory joggers:

      Who is the best dressed man or woman you know?
      Who do you know that likes nice cars?
      Who do you know that owns their own company?
      Who do you know that is successful in sales?
      Who do you know that wears an expensive watch?
      Who do you know that owns their own airplane?
      Who do you know that might have a hard time fitting in typical
   clothing?

      Thanks for your help!

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

Jeff,
  I've been in touch with fundy team members back in Houston and they keep me up to date on ENE/DYN issues. Obviously, information is very limited at this point but I was wondering what your gut feeling about the future of EGM as a whole as well as the fundy team in particular is. Also, to keep you updated, I will be returning to Houston on November 30, so I will be back in the Houston office on December 3. By the time I was suppose to return to London again we should have a better idea of where everything is going. Things in London have been great and I think people on this end have been pleased with the fundy team's contribution. I hope all is well.

Zac

Doug,
I will bring this issue up with EGAS management - - will revert with their feedback on this internal accounting transfer (i.e., no new cash to Enron) as well as the trasnfer of associated interest gonig forward, etc.  We need to consider the potential effect to Enron of this internal transfer from the perspective of legal strategies as well as current restructuring efforts with the lenders.  

On another matter: have not heard from you regarding the Venezuela trading assistance (from Vengas).  

Thanks, Mariella

With SECLP being shutdown for almost two months and no positive news in sight I think we need to address the internal transfer of $28 million to settle the outstanding fuel bill. There is no longer a reason for this to remain on EFI's receivables and we need to settle the account.

The 2002 Enron Net Works budget will for the first time combine allocations to business units for four key services:  Enron Online, IT Infrastructure, Risk Management Operations and IT Maintenance and Development.  We are providing a level of detail for expense and capital spend that is greater than that provided in past years, and that will allow business units to make informed choices regarding the services that they receive.  

We are meeting with individual business unit Offices of the Chair to review in detail the four service areas delivered through Enron Net Works.  Some of these meetings have been completed and more will occur between now and October 12.  Please keep the following points in mind as we work with you to finalize budget:

Enron Networks today is very different from this time last year.  Additions to the 2002 ENW budget are Operations for EA, EIM and EGM.  Operations, IT Maintenance and Development, and IT Infrastructure for EES and EBS have been included under the ENW umbrella for the first time in the  2002  budget as well.  The 2001 budgets for these functions were approved and included in individual business units last year.   Any comparison of ENW's 2002 versus 2001 budget must be appropriately adjusted for these organizational changes to be relevant.  

For further detail for each business unit, ENW's 2002 expense and capital dollars are organized to mirror each business unit's lines of business (products or commodities) in order to create a transparent view at a more granular level of the costs involved in supporting each of the lines of business.  

The detail that is being provided to business units for IT costs delineates licensing fees, system maintenance costs and new development costs.  Detail on each IT development project identifies the purpose, business sponsor, line of business, "in progress" or "planned" designation, expense and capital spend, system impacted, and estimated completion date.   In order to finalize IT project budgets, decisions will be required from the business units on which projects to undertake in 2002.   

If you have questions about the ENW budgets as we are working with you to finalize them,  please call one of us.

Mike/Jeff, 
 
Sato is specifically asking us about what is happening at Enron including specifically share price, billion dollar losses and Fastow issues.  Obviously the latest is getting out across the world.  While it might seem somewhat ironic given their problems that they should ask us, but these are fair questions.
 
I know we discussed this somewhat during the past weekend,  but I believe it will be important for Corp to help us "at the front" to address real concerns concerning the company.
 
Joe

      ( I hear it's empty).
      If you have time this afternoon and can walk down to your Lobby I can
      meet
      you there to show you the fabrics.  Also, bring down a check so that
   I
      can
      stop by Walter Lee Culp and order you couches and fabric ma?ana.
   Fabric
      can
      be overnighted if needed or sent 2 day.
      I think 2 day is plenty of time.

      50% now - (not including taxes)
      50% later + shipping and taxes when couches are ready for delivery
   (6-8
      wks.).

      Need now
      $5445 for 2 loveseats and 1 couch + $850 for fabric = $6295
      I will give you a receipt.
      Let me know when you can see the fabric........
      Tina

         Retail for couch is $5460 (saving $1170 about  27% lower)
         Retail for loveseat $4200 (saving $900 about 27% lower.)
         I may be able to save you more on the fabric if I can find the one
      you
         need
         at Kravets since they give me 50% off.  The majority of the
   furniture
         stores
         only give between a 20-30% off.  The couches take about 6-8 weeks
   if
         they
         are in stock and usually are.  I'll get some fabric this Friday
      during
         lunch
         and maybe I can show you over coffee that afternoon.  I'll need to
      order
         the
         fabric so add another 2 weeks at least before the store gets it.
      Also,
         I'll
         find out paying conditions but usually is 50% upfront (cash) and
   then
         the
         other 50% when ready for delivery.  They don't take credit card.
      Checks
         payable to me and I pay with my company check.
         I'll get moving and call you on Friday.
         Sound good?

            Total = $8,216.18.  Both w/out fabric.

            You need a total of 23.5 yards of fabric.  I usually get about

            The are in Houston at Walter Lee Culp.  713 623 4670.

            If you go to their web site go to the home page, then to the

      that
            says wicker, then to the tab that says more.  The design is
   Helva.

            I need 1 Helva sofa, and 2 Helva loveseats, of course in a very
      plain
            off white (not tan as one of the pictures shows) indoor/outdoor
         fabric.

            Or if you have any other ideas, let me know, of course.

Although the loss we have all recently experienced, and the loss of our
naive
sense of permanent security here in the U.S.A. effects each of us uniquely I

thought this "tail" is a nice way to think of all of the lost innocent
lives.
It's also good to share w/little kids.
Ronney
P.S. Personally, I'm going through the motions of "getting on with
day-to-day
life", but I'm perpetually tired and sad. It is hard to be joyful--or find
joy
in much of anything!

Subject: Fw: Welcome At Rainbow Bridge


For those of you that do not know what the "Rainbow Bridge" is, it is the
place where our beloved pets go when they leave this world.  Here they
wait, until that day when we once again can take them into our arms and
shower them with all our love!


Welcome At Rainbow Bridge
On the morning of September 11, 2001,
there was an unprecedented amount
of activity at the Rainbow Bridge.
Decisions had to be made.
They had to be made quickly.
And, they were.
An issue,not often addressed here,
is the fact that many residents really
have no loved one for whom to wait.
Think of the pups who lived and died
in hideous puppy mills.
No one on earth loved or protected them.
What about the many who spent
unhappy lives tied in backyards?
And, the ones who were abused.
Who are they to wait for?
We don't talk about that much up here.
We share our loved ones as
they arrive, happy to do so.
But we all know
there is nothing like having your
very own person who thinks you are
the most special pup in the Heavens.
Last Tuesday morning, 9-11-2001
a request rang out
for pups not waiting for specific persons
to volunteer for special assignment
An eager,curious crowd
surged excitedly forward,
each pup wondering
what the assignment would be.
They were told by a solemn voice
that unexpectedly,all at once,
over 4,000 loving people had left Earth
long before they were ready.
All the pups,as all pups do,felt
the humans' pain deep
in their own hearts.
Without hearing more,
there was a clamoring among them
"May I have one to comfort?"
"I'll take two,I have a big heart."
"I have been saving kisses forever."
One after another they came forward
begging for assignment.
One cozy-looking fluffy pup
hesitantly asked,
"Are there any children coming?
I would be very comforting
for a child 'cause
I'm soft and squishy
and I always wanted to be hugged."
A group of Dalmatians came forward
asking to meet the Firemen
and be their friends.
The larger working breeds offered to
greet the Police Officers
and make them feel at home.
Little dogs volunteered to do
what they do best, cuddle and kiss.
Dogs who on Earth
had never had a kind word
or a pat on the head,
stepped forward and said,
"I will love any human who needs love."
Then all the dogs,
wherever on Earth
they originally came from,
rushed to the Rainbow Bridge
and stood waiting,
overflowing with love to share
each tail wagging an American Flag.

Rick,

As you know we have stopped our agricultural commodity businesses, and therefore do not need any VAR associated with these businesses.  If this VAR is allocated to EGM, I would like to reallocate it within the business unit.  If VAR is approved for specific businesses, EGM will give this VAR back to Corp.

As well, I would like to reclass all softs, grains, and meats on the DPR as "other" and remove those headings.

Thanks

Jeff,

Sorry I haven't answered sooner but I have been in a workshop for several days.  I had a buyer for the land and he is not able to get the land until late Dec or early Jan.  I am trying very hard to sell the land so that I can repay you.  I have someone else looking as well.

I will keep you posted and I know you need your money asap.  

Thanks again for your help!

Dear Mr LeBeau:
How's it going? Thank you for returning my call today. As you may remember, I met you, Mr Shankman, Ms Leibman, and Ms Li Sun at Cavanaughs with Matt Commons on Wednesday October 3rd. 

During that meeting, Mr Shankman suggested that I visit Enron down in Houston in the next few weeks. As I have not been placed on the closed interview list at Wharton, I was wondering if I could conduct the interview process while in Houston? Please see my updated resume attached for your review.

Please let me know if this would be possible. I am still very interested in obtaining a full-time position in the Associate Program at Enron.

Kind regards,
Edward Divgi

Subject:	2002 Corporate Allocations to EIM


Attached please find the corporate allocations for the 2002 fiscal year that EIM will accept.  After unsuccessfully attempting to get some justification for the PROPOSED allocations from many of the various corporate groups, we have had to make a determination ourselves as to what we believe are reasonable charges for the value received from these groups.  This determination was based on several factors including, 2001 actual allocations, expected services provided to EIM, redundant services provided by other groups that are also performed at EIM, etc.

The attached charges are acceptable to EIM and will be used in the budget presentation to the office of the chair unless the allocating groups can come to an agreement with Kent Castleman of EIM as to a revision of these charges before such meeting.

Mike and Jeff,

This is the most recent version.  FYI - these sheets should be 'date stamped' at the bottom when you print so that we will know we are working with the most recent version.

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Ken Lay

As you guys go through working up a severance program, I started thinking about some equity issues.  If the average tenure of an employee at Enron is about 3 years, why not come up with 2 plans--1 for long serving employees who have been long dedicated to the company, and a second one for the more recently hired?  It doesnt' make sense to me that someone who has been here under a year at $100,000 base should be entitled to 11 weeks even before they sign the waiver.  I would also not change the program in whatever form you ultimately settle on for the longer serving employees, rather just scale back the program for the newer employees.

Jeff

Bubbee,

How's it going?  Definitely, next time I'm in NY, I'll let you take me to dinner--at least drinks.  By the way, I don't know if you know that I'm currently offerring a car to anyone who finds me a wife.  Keep it in mind.

Anyway,  I paid $10,900 plus tax, total $11799.25.  For you $6,000.  There are no more available, only 1912 were made in total.  (divided between white, yellow and rose gold.)  1912 was when the model came out, and this was a reissue.  I have all papers, and box.

Find me a girlfriend, please.

David,

I run a $650 million dollar commodities fund at Harvard Management Company.
Our focus has been on arbitrage strategies in the commodity arena - we are
looking to expand into weather and power. I was wondering, if given the
potential situation at Enron, that there might be employees interested in
interviewing for several positions both within my group and foreign equities
? I apologize if this is too forward or that I have assumed too much in
terms of potential restructurings.

Thanks,

Dear Enron Top Management:

Do you know how serious situation of Enron Japan's business is?

We can't see any improvement of Joe Hirl's management.

Furthermore, due to overseas staff's big attitude and ignorance of Japanese
business manner, we found that not only Japanese companies but also Amrican
investment banks would not like to do business with Enron. Specially after
Enron Japan announced to trade at "TOCOM", a market controlled by Japanese
"Boryokudan" (Mafia), Enron's image become worse and worse in Japan.

Just wonder when this "Tatanic" will sink?

Regards
Sato

Given the total and complete lack of communication from management, I can only assume the worst about our financial situation.  Is there any reason that I should not be trying to sell EFM?  We could at least recoup what we have spent so far.  It may be pennies relative to the problem, but like you, I would like to find a way to keep the momentum of the group and do what is right for our employees.

The only downside could be the PR, but at $14.00, I can't imagine that matters anymore.

Please advise.

Dan

Jeff,
Let us know If you have suggestions on a replacement. This is the second year in a row Kevin has backed out on interviewing at the last minute.  If we can't find anyone, we'll have to interview fewer people.  The replacement would need to fly to Phila Monday night and would get back late on Tue night.

Rick,

As you know we have stopped our agricultural commodity businesses, and therefore do not need any VAR associated with these businesses.  If this VAR is allocated to EGM, I would like to reallocate it within the business unit.  If VAR is approved for specific businesses, EGM will give this VAR back to Corp.

As well, I would like to reclass all softs, grains, and meats on the DPR as "other" and remove those headings.

Thanks

Jeff

In the wake of US and British military action in Afghanistan, Washington has become increasingly concerned about the potential for a major military conflict between Pakistan and India, according to a high level US intelligence official, and the control of nuclear weapons in the region is being monitored.  There is also fear for instability in Saudi Arabia, where little information is available about the capabilities and intentions of Islamic extremist elements.  Consensus opinion has been built in Washington that Iraq was involved in the 11 September terrorist attacks on the US, exacerbating fears that the situation in the region could spiral out of control.  

According to a senior US intelligence official, US policymakers have become increasingly concerned about the prospects for instability in the Middle East and South Asia.  Washington is focused particularly on the potential for a major conflict between Pakistan and India, and intelligence officials are attempting to track the location and control of nuclear weapons in the region.  Secretary of State Powell's trip to the two countries, although portrayed publicly as part of the effort to ensure support for US military action in Afghanistan, is in fact intended to address tensions between Islamabad and New Delhi, which have grown in recent days.  (India shelled several Pakistani military outposts in the disputed Kashmir territory today; an Indian army general described it as a "punitive action.")

Washington is also significantly more concerned than media coverage would suggest over the potential for major unrest in Saudi Arabia.  This fear is heightened by a lack of detailed information available on the royal family's grip on power and the capabilities of Islamic extremist elements in Saudi Arabia, which share similar goals: removal of the Saudi dynasty, establishment of a true Islamic state, and the removal of the US military presence.  Saudi and US officials regard bin Ladin as one of the prime perpetrators of Islamic extremist violence in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere in the region.  Bin Ladin has been outspoken in his criticism of what he calls 'military occupation' of Saudi Arabia.  Unrest in Saudi Arabia could have a relatively dramatic impact on regional stability and the global economy because of its leading role both in the Arab world and in OPEC.

US government officials are now generally convinced that the Iraqi government played a role in supporting the 11 September terrorist strikes in the US.  The well-publicized difference of opinion between senior State and Defense Department officials over the handling of the Iraq question has been reported accurately in the media. Concern is growing within Washington that the situation in the Middle East could spiral out of control if Iraq were drawn into the military conflict precipitously, if major hostilities between Pakistan and India were to break out, or if the Saudi royal family's grip on power were to loosen.

Payroll will print out a hard copy of his Nov 15th check today and forward that to his office.  It is too late to change his Nov 30th check but we will print one on Friday and forward that one too.

The HR Service Connection Team will process the change in the system so that hard copies will be delivered beginning with December.

related field). Team members will begin the competition phase with
brainstorming session about the central challenge presented by the speakers.
With the encouragement of their mentors, they will work through a series of

Jeff,

As discussed yesterday, provided below is the note I mentioned.  Please call to discuss.  I would like to get this inter-company relationship agreed today.

Eric      x52711





In an effort to promote an internal operating business structure that maximizes the value opportunities for Enron in respect to European LNG activities, provided below is an agreed group interaction protocol.

Defined points of contact
LNG's European commercial lead:	Clay Harris
Continental Commercial Nat Gas lead:	Steve Sapling

Clay Harris and Steve Asplin shall meet at a minimum weekly to discuss current ongoing business and relevant future transaction prospects.  

Prospective transactions with existing European LNG Market Participants
The LNG group shall continue to advance the execution of Master LNG Purchase and Sales Agreements with these relevant European LNG players: Distrigas, Tractabel, GdF, Gas Natural, Repsol, Enagas, Botas, Enel, SNAM/ENI, Edison, Iberdrola, Union Fenosa, Endesa, etc.  Clay Harris and Steve Asplin will coordinate these activities, which will be further coordinated with the relevant EEL country representatives.  The LNG group shall always use Steve Asplin and these relationship managers to coordinate meetings to discuss LNG opportunities on a regional and global basis.  An invitation to join these meetings should and shall always be extended to both groups when LNG opportunities are to be discussed.  European ex-ship LNG transactions shall not require intermediation by the EEL nat gas trading desk. However, the LNG group shall always keep the relevant EEL trading desks aware of the proposed transactions in advance. 

LNG Sales into France and Belgium
The groups will maintain daily contact regarding prospective LNG terminal capacity positions and LNG sales.  The two group's main short term interaction objective shall be for the facilitation of market making for the prospective LNG deliveries by the LNG group.  An important factor that all parties must appreciate is that Enron's activities in Belgium are extremely sensitive to relationship issues with Distrigas.

LNG Sales into Spain
At this point in its development, the natural gas market in Spain is unique to other continental markets given the limited access to source pipelines and the significant market share of LNG.  As such, a coordinated effort to source, create and execute transactions is imperative for Enron's success.  To create an atmosphere of thorough communication, the EEL nat gas group will ensure that an invitation is extended to the LNG group for its gas marekting meetings and discussions, and that the LNG group is completely informed regarding potential transactions.  The LNG group will ensure that the EEL nat gas group is kept fully informed and included in potential sourcing activities.  The overriding goal shall be to ensure that transactions are completed that create the maximum possible value for Enron Corp.

Current Proposed Spanish Transaction
As discussed above, in order to capture the current prospective transaction opportunities in Spain, EEL and Global LNG have agreed to jointly take the proposed length position (0.7BCM/yr for 2 to 5 years) in Spain.  The P&L shall be managed on a complete open book basis (i.e. groups will exchange all relevant term sheets associated with LNG purchases, nat gas sales, re-gas and transit costs, and shipping).  Any margins generated shall be split between the groups.  Determination of the relevant margins shall take into account the market value of LNG groups prior existing LNG charter positions, as well as prior existing EEL  trading desk positions nat gas group.  

The final determination of the value split shall be made on a fully open book basis by Eric Gonzales and Eric Shaw.

Hey Jeff.  Have a favor to ask.  Trying to get clarification on the Enron
balance sheet.  If you have some time can we speak about various aspects of
the business?  I know you are busy, and not necessarily as familiar with the
off balances sheet structures, but perhaps you could be of some assistance.
I think your the smartest guy I know that still works there.  Maybe its your
Penn roots.

I am in Houston over Thanksgiving.  Perhaps we can finally get that long
awaited drink you owe me!  If in London please give me a call.  I have a
great place here you are welcome to crash at.

I spoke to Peter Lee. Their intent, on the German deal, is to continue to push it in it's temp format. It's obvious
from our discussion that without credit enhancement we won't be the counterparty. He also told me that "other"
weather groups are marketing hard against us on a credit basis.

A Rabbi was opening his mail one morning.  Taking the

The next Friday night he announced to his congregants, "I have known many

They best way to manage your day gas problem would be to find counterparties that you are long last day prompt swaps (that are expiring now), and take them off throughout the day.  For example, if a counterparty wants to reduce settlement risk, you can have a futures broker help manage match swaps counterparties and do an offsetting futures position, from which you can get long futures.

I gave the first round of documents to Randy on 10/11; we then made changes to the non-compete agreement last Tuesday, the 16th. The retention agreement did not change.

If he is going to remote places in conn. and nj that are not served by local trains, etc, I would understand, but most places george visits have frequent train/taxi svc.  I would not expect day trips to be hard to work around train schedules.  This also seems trivial on his part, since most of his car svc for last trip to nyc were expensed to Wilbur Ross, who george says he met once.  I'd rather not go on on this point.

George,

Jeff has just signed your expense account from last month.  It has been on hold because we have stopped approving all submitted reports that include car services (for all of EGM) that are outside of the direct airport to the hotel charges.  We have made statements to everyone via memo and our commitment to our bosses that we are watching our costs especially those like these specifically.  In most cities cabs or other shorter hires are available.  

We are not attempting to be cheap but we have put this is a hard rule and of course includes Jeff and me.  We haven't and will not do it either.  We don't want to discuss this further and it is not something we will think about again but we wanted to be clear.

Thanks,
Mike and Jeff

Mike/Jeff,

Any reason why you think John still has some responsibility here? Also have found that EPower is now under Hughes (EGS), but Nick stills reports to John.  It would seem that John's plan is to maintain a (cheap) option to come back in when the time is ready.

Captain Gault was primarily involved in the review of the Excaliber construction.  As this is now coming to an end Tony felt uncomfortable with our limited vessel build strategy.  He has not indicated where he is going.  Regarding Tim, if we need services outside of his capabilities we have agreed we will just hire a consultant for the remainder of our requirements.  

Regards,
Eric

Jeff,

Tony Galt, of the LNG group, gave two weeks notice last week.  His last day will be October 31st.  Tony functions as the LNG group's marine superintendent, reporting to Tim Nash under Jonathan Whitehead.  It appears that Tim Nash will be picking up these functions for at least the remainder of the year.  Let me know if you would like any further information.

<p><SPAN class=text2>The new Bella Sera Pinot Grigio is clean, crisp and refreshing. Utilizing fruit from the Tre Venezie region and subtle winemaker influence, Bella Sera captures the essence of the Pinot Grigio varietal and is a wine that is "true to the grape". The 1999 Pinot Grigio has a clear, straw color and a pleasant nose with delicate aromas of apricot and tropical fruit. This wine is refreshing and crisp with a light to medium body that will allow it to pair well with dishes of all types. Particularly good pairings include grilled vegetables, light pasta dishes and seafood. The refreshing style of the wine makes it a must for hot summer months.</P></span>

<p><SPAN class=text2>The new Bella Sera Merlot clearly attests to the rising notoriety of Merlot in general, and Italian Merlot in particular, by offering a full flavored style without the more astringent tannins found in Cabernet Sauvignon. Ruby red in color, with aromas of currants and cherries, Bella Sera Merlot offers supple plum and blackberry flavors on the palate, and a ripe, rich finish. The vibrant fruit flavors and good acidity of this Merlot make it an excellent match with a wide range of foods, including tomato-based pasta dishes, grilled meats and poultry.</P></span>

Jez our concerns are not just an internal approval issue. Under Australian Law the Directors of ECAPPL need to be satisfied when a company incurs a debt that it can be paid. Failure to discharge this duty can mean the directors would be personally for the debt. If the Coal Group is comfortable to make to enter into these commitments   then that is the obvious way forward. One of the Coal Group in the Sydney office (presumably Paul McPhee) could replace Heidi Mason as resident director.

We seem to be going round in circle's here and hence hopefully all the relevant people are now on copy of this e-mail so we can resolve swiftly. This cargo is due to be shipped in seven days with the coal already being railed to port. It is coal which will be shipped to service European commitments and represents the cheapest way to do so taking all costs into account (including financing). Needless to say if we pull out of this deal at this stage it will have huge ramifications with our customer and send all the wrong signals to our counterparties in this part of the world. Last but not least we will need to look elsewhere to procure coal for these European sales at what is likely to be a higher price.

Appreciate the green light.

George:

Details on the cargo we are loading out of Newcastle.  Sailing time is roughly 45 days.  Cargo to be sold to ARA/German customers, most with payment terms 5 days post delivery.  Also - it would help to get an idea of how diificult this exercise will be in the coming months, as we have a couple more loading before year end.

Work it,

Stu

Stu,

I refer to your e-mail to Jez last week and advise you the expected payment value and timing etc.

Vessel name:	MV "Cotsworld"
ETA:		21/Nov 
ETS:		22/Nov
Loading tonnage: approx. 128kmt (9kmt from Stratford and 119kmt from Bengalla)
Payment value and timing :	
		Value		Timing	
 Bengalla:	US$3.3mil(*)	19th (**)
 Stratford:	US$0.2mil(*)	26th  		

* Inclusive of 10% GST
** Bengall has already delivered 49kmt of coal to port and will complete the delivery on 15th. 
The contract is based on FIS and the invoice weight and quality be determined by the inbound analysis while they take des/dem risk.
Because of their concern over our credit Bengalla has insisted on our payment by TT against the presentation of documents. Docs are likely to be 
presented on 16th or 19th at the latest. 

The draft contract which Bengalla has confirmed has a provision that the invoice weight is determined based on B/L quantity instead of inbound rail weight 
if we take 100% of Bengalla coal onto our vessel. If we do that, they can not present their docs until the vessel has compeleted the loading and our payment date would be say 26th instead.

Regards,


Tark

Dear Jeff,

I have not received any payment from the following Pledges to our annual
gala which took place on April 7, 2001:

Natsource        Contact:                 Address:
EDF Mann         Contact:                 Address:
Banque Paribas   Contact:                 Address:
Spectron         Contact:                 Address:

I have pledges of $5,000 from each company.  Marti told me that you did
write to the appropriate contacts.  Do we need to follow up again?

I do want to close out the gala pledges by June 30, 2001.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.  Please let me know what I can
do to help.  My direct line is 713-284-8262.

Grace Pierce
Assistant Director of Development

Hello all,

We want to be closing this deal before the end of the week as well. The parties in this deal are Kleimar N.V. from Antwerp Belgium, and ECTRIC through EEFT. We are entering into a Time Charter agreement, where Kleimar charters a vessel from us (the one obtained in the original Mitsui deal) , and then through a Contract of Affreightment we will be receiving five voyages (different ships). I will follow up on the timing of these in my next email.

We will put in place a Master Agreement which should allow us to net out these two contracts (the Time Charter and the COA) as well as any other future physical business we enter into with them, if anything goes wrong. The Master sets out default and cross default events. This will allow us to have tighter control over the counterparty. I have attached a draft of the Master Agreement which will be signed at the same time as the Time Charter and the COA. So overall this deal will have three documents. The Time Charter, the COA and the Master Agreement.

Kleimar is giving us a Letter of Credit for 250,000 to cover our exposure, which has been agreed by Credit. We will be receiving the Time Charter and COA docs shortly which I will send around. The changes in those documents reflect the principles in the Master Agreement. Please let me know if anyone has any concerns or issues with this deal as soon as possible. (0207 783 4084).

Ian

No one is really making a concerted effort with respect to utilities.
Going forward we should:
1- get as list of all utilities with whom we have ISDAs
2-sign up more of them
3- coordinate activities between gas, power, coal, weatehr and crude and prodcuts
4- analyze previous deals with each utlity--see who we have been ignoring and restart relationships
5- figure out which large industrials are multi-fuel users and include them
6-consider weather linked products: HDD dependent hating oil calls
7- coordinate with PER SEkse--re trigger options -- where we may be able to lay off risk

As for Fuel Oil, it doesn't seem to be working to hold the switching demand like we thought it would.  Prices are coming off but with Natty not moving much in the past few days it has made little effect.  On Mon seeing FP&L selling almost 500,000 bbls of NYh 1% in Aug and Sep.  Mirant has been out the whole week buying and the utilities are also long Cal 02, Cal 03 but have yet to dump it.  Seeing utilities switch in the NYC region, even though prices are slowly coming off.  Woudl expect if you get heat to see some utilities use their storage and burn some fuel but unless Natty goes back up to 4 ish I think we may be off the mrkt for a little bit here.  Watchign for signs that may come back on after summer.  Additional issue being that demand as a whole is very weak, so even w/o Natty at such low levels, we would be just a weak.  As of tonight:

NYH Jul 19.00/bbl = 3.025 (w/o taxes and transport, right off the barge)

coal (EAST

12,000btu/lb
therefore 55/(12*2)= 2.29/ MMBTU

heat  rate 10

nagural gas (NYMEX)
3.14

most efficient new gen heat rate 7.0

therefore 21.98/mwh


all back of the envelope--but when we get heat will gens increase coal (push limits)--or will gas become more of the baseload

OPEC meeting was crazy.  Saudis are behaving strangely; they seem like they really don't have their act together.  It looks bearish for the time being -- WTI in the teens over the next few months unless war fears take it up.

Hi Christie,
                   I just received your response and tried calling to thank you for interviewing me yesterday. Your personal and prompt email is truly representative of Enron's ability to not only hire but also retain the best and the brightest. Up until today I have found no recruiter to bring out the problematic issues of a firm. The very fact that you put Enron's current problems on the table shows how strongly and genuinely you feel about the firm being secure and stable. I really appreciated you letting me defend Enron; it not only shows you my passion but also reiterates my genuine interest in the firm.
I am writing to let you know that I had second rounds today as you know and in the first interview, which was supposed to be conducted by Jen Fraser but was conducted by Matt, a first year analyst, the concern was on GPA and academic performance rather that what value I can add or my keen interest in the firm. I was extremely shaken after this first interview; in the interview right after, Sarah, an associate, did manage to alleviate some of my concerns. However, I was wondering if this could possibly serve as a road block in the recruiting process as I really do not believe that my GPA is low or an accurate representation of my capabilities to perform on the job. I honestly feel that a 3.2 at Wharton equates to a much higher GPA at any other school in the United States.
Although disheartened, I am extremely interested in Enron as a firm and am confident that if given the chance I will emerge as one of your most valued candidates. Thank you so very much.

Sincerely,
Aziz.

Rick,

As you know we have stopped our agricultural commodity businesses, and therefore do not need any VAR associated with these businesses.  If this VAR is allocated to EGM, I would like to reallocate it within the business unit.  If VAR is approved for specific businesses, EGM will give this VAR back to Corp.

As well, I would like to reclass all softs, grains, and meats on the DPR as "other" and remove those headings.

Thanks

Subject:	RE: coal and gas calculations

As for Fuel Oil, it doesn't seem to be working to hold the switching demand like we thought it would.  Prices are coming off but with Natty not moving much in the past few days it has made little effect.  On Mon seeing FP&L selling almost 500,000 bbls of NYh 1% in Aug and Sep.  Mirant has been out the whole week buying and the utilities are also long Cal 02, Cal 03 but have yet to dump it.  Seeing utilities switch in the NYC region, even though prices are slowly coming off.  Woudl expect if you get heat to see some utilities use their storage and burn some fuel but unless Natty goes back up to 4 ish I think we may be off the mrkt for a little bit here.  Watchign for signs that may come back on after summer.  Additional issue being that demand as a whole is very weak, so even w/o Natty at such low levels, we would be just a weak.  As of tonight:

NYH Jul 19.00/bbl = 3.025 (w/o taxes and transport, right off the barge)

coal (EAST
45$/t + 10$ freight = 55$
12,000btu/lb
therefore 55/(12*2)= 2.29/ MMBTU

heat  rate 10
therfore 22.90/MWH


nagural gas (NYMEX)
3.14

most efficient new gen heat rate 7.0

therefore 21.98/mwh


all back of the envelope--but when we get heat will gens increase coal (push limits)--or will gas become more of the baseload

Jeff,

London
I would like to have turrets for my guys in London.  As a small group where everyone is learning and involved in everything it helps for them to communicate better internally and externally.  I have been told by London that our phone usage does not warrant turrets.  I don't want that to be the basis on which the decision is made.  Paul and I believe they are necessary to the business, our cost structure is reasonable and will improve over time.

I want the phones and I want to be able to operate the business as we see fit.  If London has a bloated cost structure that is their issue and I don't want them to make it mine.

USA Allocations
I met with IT on Monday regarding my allocations and I still find them to be unacceptable.  For example, my overhead allocation is approximately half of Dan's, yet we have about 25% of the people working on our system.  I will discuss with Brent, but wanted you to know.

Jeff,
  Hi. How is everything going? I was wondering what is going on with the trading track and if maybe I can interview with some people over here in the UK. I've contacted Karen Buckley a few times on the issue, but have not heard anything and I know interviews were over a week ago, so I thought I'd drop you a line.
  Otherwise, how do the Penn recruits look? If there is anything I can do from overseas, please let me know.

Thanks,
Zac

Unfortunately, you cannot expense weapons.  If you could, I suspect everyone would have already.

I'm happy to get Ken to campus whenever we can.  I'll get the available 2nd semester dates and send them to you.  Hopefully we can try to get something incorporated into the curriculum during that semester in conjunction with a visit.

Also, my guess is that you've been getting a lot of calls from people disappointed about not being on our preselect list.  (I know that I have).  We received 215 resumes for 42 interview slots, so there are a lot of good people that we didn't preselect - we gave preference to people who had investment banking/trading and/or energy experience that we thought would have a higher likelihood of moving to Houston.  I've been telling the people who have called to try to get added to the invite list that they can sign up for any open interview slots on Oct. 25 in the online CareerTrack system.

Here are the available 1st semester dates - 
November 1
November 15
December 6

They probably also have some flexibility to schedule him to speak on another date if that coincides with his schedule - ie. he's going to be in NY or DC and can just do a quick stop in Philadelphia.

I've attached the agenda that discusses a typical schedule for Zwieg.

I know Mike asked you for the 10 biggest P&L deals that we could look to restructure, but I'd like to see as many as possible be business unit.  In addition, I'd like to see as many as possible (or that make sense) from crude and products.  Get with Rob Fuller on this.

Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

Jeff,
 
Per our conversation earlier this month I discussed with Vince Kaminski the possibility of getting a quant. guy on permanent loan to our group to help manage the more complex analyses I want our guys to be doing.
 
Vince is amenable to letting us have one of his managers.  However, because is group is stretched thin and he wants to keep his headcount flat, he would want to hire a replacement and charge the manager we get to us.
 
I would also want to hire an analyst to help this quant. guy with general research ideas and data gathering.
 
Is this acceptable to you?
 
Jeff

Hi Carol, I was thinking about a few more shirts.  You really need to have
a referral discount or some other incentive program for your clients.  It
may help.

   I was wondering if you might be able to help me.  I need to finish
   strong
   this year.  I am attempting to reach the goal of $336,000 in clothing
   sales
   by the end of the year.  Obviously, no single client will be able to
   help me
   do this.  So I was wondering if you might be able to help me out by
   giving
   me the names of some qualified gentlemen or ladies that might be
   interested
   in the type of service we offer.

   Some things to consider:

   We offer ready-made (off the rack) clothing as well as custom.
   We offer all types of men's clothing including casual.

   If you know of some mid to upper level executive women, they may have an
   interest as well.

   Some memory joggers:

   Who is the best dressed man or woman you know?
   Who do you know that likes nice cars?
   Who do you know that owns their own company?
   Who do you know that is successful in sales?
   Who do you know that wears an expensive watch?
   Who do you know that owns their own airplane?
   Who do you know that might have a hard time fitting in typical clothing?

   Thanks for your help!

I've got 2 samples of fabric.  1 plain off white and the other a ribbed off
white.  Elizabeth and I prefer the ribbed.
Plain = $40 retail / $20 cost
Ribbed = $50 retail  / $25 cost x 34 yards = $850
I'll give them to you at cost so that we can continue furnishing your house
( I hear it's empty).
If you have time this afternoon and can walk down to your Lobby I can meet
you there to show you the fabrics.  Also, bring down a check so that I can
stop by Walter Lee Culp and order you couches and fabric ma?ana.  Fabric can
be overnighted if needed or sent 2 day.
I think 2 day is plenty of time.

50% now - (not including taxes)
50% later + shipping and taxes when couches are ready for delivery (6-8
wks.).

Need now
$5445 for 2 loveseats and 1 couch + $850 for fabric = $6295
I will give you a receipt.
Let me know when you can see the fabric........
Tina

   Retail for couch is $5460 (saving $1170 about  27% lower)
   Retail for loveseat $4200 (saving $900 about 27% lower.)
   I may be able to save you more on the fabric if I can find the one you
   need
   at Kravets since they give me 50% off.  The majority of the furniture
   stores
   only give between a 20-30% off.  The couches take about 6-8 weeks if
   they
   are in stock and usually are.  I'll get some fabric this Friday during
   lunch
   and maybe I can show you over coffee that afternoon.  I'll need to order
   the
   fabric so add another 2 weeks at least before the store gets it.  Also,
   I'll
   find out paying conditions but usually is 50% upfront (cash) and then
   the
   other 50% when ready for delivery.  They don't take credit card.  Checks
   payable to me and I pay with my company check.
   I'll get moving and call you on Friday.
   Sound good?

      Sofa = $4290
      Loveseat = $3300
      8.25% tax = $626.18.
      Total = $8,216.18.  Both w/out fabric.

      You need a total of 23.5 yards of fabric.  I usually get about a
   30-35%
      discount on fabric so if you are OK with the couch prices, I can go
   to
      the
      Decorative Center and get some fabric samples for you to choose from.
   I
      have no clue as to how much indoor/outdoor fabric goes for but I'll
   get
      a
      range so that you can see the difference between the cheaper and
      expensive
      type.  Let me know how you would like to proceed.

      Thanks for you help.

      The site is www.thewickerworks.com.  Click on it to go directly

      The are in Houston at Walter Lee Culp.  713 623 4670.

      If you go to their web site go to the home page, then to the tab that
      says wicker, then to the tab that says more.  The design is Helva.

      I need 1 Helva sofa, and 2 Helva loveseats, of course in a very plain
      off white (not tan as one of the pictures shows) indoor/outdoor
   fabric.

      Or if you have any other ideas, let me know, of course.

With the announcement of Enron's acquisition by Dynegy behind us, and with =
the initial severance process completed, it seemed an appropriate time to e=
ffect some organizational changes so that we as a group are better prepared=
 to meet the challenges of the future.  Before I turn to the organizational=
 changes, I would like to say a few words about those who will be leaving t=
he company as a result of the initial severance (you'll know who they are b=
y their absence on the organizational chart): Leading and being a part of t=
his group has been a privilege?I am thankful for every day that I have had =
that responsibility and thankful for however long I continue to have the re=
sponsibility.  This sense of privilege and thankfulness is primarily driven=
 by having had the opportunity to get to know and care about such a dedicat=
ed group of professionals and support staff and who, to a person, are also =
very decent and good people.  To say good-bye to some of our colleagues is =
not easy.  I want to, on behalf of all of us, thank them for their hard wor=
k, their integrity, their decency, and the good times and laughter that we =
shared.  I trust that many of us will find ways to sustain friendships that=
 have been and will continue to be very special.  Thanks to each of you who=
 are leaving for all you have done.

As to the organizational structure, it has become increasingly apparent to =
me that the existing organization, with a mix of groups organized along fun=
ctional and regional lines (particularly within the U.S.), has impeded our =
ability to get things done in the most efficient fashion at times.  The nee=
d to rationalize the organizational structure, in order to consolidate all =
U.S. energy functions, is a strong need from my perspective.  As a result, =
Jim Steffes will lead the U.S. Energy group along with Sue Nord, who will j=
ointly report to Jim and myself.  Sue will assist Jim in the leadership of =
the group and take on project management responsibilities as warranted to h=
elp Jim shoulder a significant burden.  Also reporting to Jim will be a lea=
dership group for U.S. Energy that will be as follows:  Wholesale Electrici=
ty will be led by Christi Nicolay; Retail Electricity and Natural Gas will =
be led by Harry Kingerski; Wholesale Gas will be led by Leslie Lawner.   La=
st, but not least, Jeff Dasovich and Sue Mara, who will continue to focus o=
n California energy issues, will report to Jim. (Sue Mara will also be part=
 of the Wholesale electricity team).

Steve Montovano, who will continue to report to me, will lead a commercial =
development effort along with Dan Allegretti.

With the elimination of the regional groups, I also recognize that there is=
 a need to continue to focus on how we as a group address our political/leg=
islative needs across the U.S.  Paul Kaufman will lead a small group that w=
ill address that need and that will focus on state political support.  Paul=
 will also take the lead for Government Affairs in support of corporate dev=
elopment efforts across the U.S.

Much of the rest of the group remains the same.  Linda Robertson will conti=
nue to lead the Washington group with Sarah Novosel, who reports to Linda, =
taking the lead role in our coordination of activities at FERC.  Amr Ibrahi=
m will continue to lead the support of the Global Assets group and also con=
tinue to manage the Risk Analytics function.  Maggy Huson will take over su=
pport of the non-energy business units, which are as follows: Global Market=
s, Industrial Markets, Networks, and Broadband.  Rob Hemstock will continue=
 to lead the support of Enron Canada.  Paul Dawson, who heads up government=
 affairs for Europe; Sergio Assad, who heads up government affairs for Sout=
h America; and Mike Grimes and Mark Crowther, who head up our Asian efforts=
, will continue to jointly report to the business units and myself.

I am also forming a North American leadership group for Government Affairs =
to provide policy guidance for the larger group and the company.  That Comm=
ittee will consist of Rob Hemstock, Maggy Huson, Amr Ibrahim, Paul Kaufman,=
 Harry Kingerski, Leslie Lawner, Steve Montovano, Christi Nicolay, Sue Nord=
, Sarah Novosel, Linda Robertson, Jim Steffes and myself.  We will also con=
tinue to have an RCR Committee that will consist of Maggy Huson, Harry King=
erski, Sue Nord, Linda Robertson, Jim Steffes & myself.  Finally, I am form=
ing a Dynegy/Enron regulatory approvals working group that will consist of =
Jose Bestard, Paul Dawson, Paul Kaufman, Sue Nord, Sarah Novosel and myself=
.

No organizational structure or set of organizational changes is either perf=
ect or permanent.  I believe these changes will make us better and more pre=
pared for the future.  However, we must be prepared to further adjust as th=
e future unfolds for the company.

One final note: I am deeply sorry that each of you has had to live through =
this uncertain and troubled period for the company.  We are all saddened by=
 the recognition that we are in the midst of changes that will leave our gr=
oup fundamentally altered, but we must resolve to do our best for each othe=
r and ourselves during this period of change to ensure that what emerges, f=
or those of us who do remain a part of the new Dynegy, reflects the excelle=
nce and integrity that has characterized our group.  Personally, I will do =
all I can, for as long as I can, to steer the group through this to the ver=
y best place possible.  Your continued dedication and support is very much =
appreciated.  Hang in there and thanks.

Hi Laura,  

I was just called into a meeting with Ken Lay, and Greg Whalley, the CEO and President, respectively, of Enron at 3:00 pm central time.  Unfortunately we will have to reschedule our call.  I am copying my asst, Jennifer Burns, on this, so she can facilitate our rescheduling the demo.

Thanks for understanding, and I look forward to speaking with you.

Jeff

Hi Jeff.  Thanks to Jenne for the introduction. Bob Verratti tells me that
we are confirmed for a call and web-ex demo at 1:30 Pacific tomorrow,
Wednesday, November 14. I will call you at (713) 853-1761 and the demo will
be directed to your email address. We have had extensive discussions about
the Opt4 platform with Greg Whalley, Greg Piper, Jay Webb and a number of
others at Enron and I look forward to having the opportunity to demonstrate
it for you.  Although the Opt4 platform can be used for many purposes, its
unique application is in the trading of customized (OTC style) derivatives
for any underlying market. The platform itself  allows an infinite amount of
deal customization which we have chosen to constrain through the use of
"smart templates" each of which reflects a structure recognized and traded
on the OTC.  Traders then specify all terms within the template and post
bids, offers or RFQ's to the site. All activity on the site (both postings
and trade match) are constrained by our "pre-permissioning" system which
checks in real time the trade specific and portfolio VaR to assure head room
limits would not be exceeded.   We have spent a year building out with BOTCC
the first ever clearing interface capable of handling this level of trade
customization.  All standard clearance and settlement services are available
through our  strategic partnership with BOTCC.  The end result is a fully
integrated solution bringing transparency and credit support to OTC markets,
whether in emerging markets such as chemicals, weather, or steel, or in
established commodity and financial markets.  Our target customers fall into
three categories:  1) established exchanges wanting to expand into
customized trades linked to their existing product lines, 2) dealers or
market makers seeking to automate and expand their phone business, 3) B2B's
wanting to offer risk management products to support their cash market
trading. The attached documents are quite high level but may help to get you
oriented before our call tomorrow. They include a brief description of the
Company, product summary,  a synopsis of platform functionality and hosting
services and a white paper on our proprietary permssioning and risk
management systems. I'll look forward to speaking with you tomorrow.

Hi Jason,

I hope the Dallas, Texas show was good for you guys, and of course, it was nice seeing you again.  Also, the two times I came by at the NY show last weekend, you guys were swamped!  I'm sorry I didn't stop by again, but my frined started feeling badly, and we left for a while.

I remember your telling me in Dallas that a small early (1950's?) pitcher was going to be available now the the museum wasn't going to pursue it, and the price was around $32,000.  Is that piece available?  I'm interested and would like to talk to you about it.

Best Regards,

Hi Cindi,

Bummer on the Adlers and the Wolffs.  What about going the Shell Corp route since the desk will most likely be in that gallery?  Any more sense on what interest the desk is generating?

Later,

Jeff

Jeff and Kath:

Well, I did not fair too well this weekend in regard to fundraising for the
desk.  Here is the report:

Gail and Louis Adler declined saying that they loved the desk, think it is
important for the museum etc. but that they did not want to be part of a
group.  They said that if something arose in the furuture that was more
reasonable and that they could do alone that they might be interested in
helping.

Cyvia and Melvyn Wolff also declined.  Cyvia said that they were quite torn
because it made sense due to their furniture connections and how important
the desk is but ultimately they want their fund to grow into something and
if they dedicate it to the desk there will be nothing left.

I am still trying to reach Nina and Michael.

Margaret Skidmore is meeting with Susan Borches from Shell on the 28th so we
may get a sense there.  Maybe we should coordinate a pitch with Margaret
when she gets back.  Perhaps a call to Mr. Miller might be a good idea (?).

That is all for now.  If you have any reports or any new suggestions, please
let me know.

Thanks,
cindi

Jeff,

London
I would like to have turrets for my guys in London.  As a small group where everyone is learning and involved in everything it helps for them to communicate better internally and externally.  I have been told by London that our phone usage does not warrant turrets.  I don't want that to be the basis on which the decision is made.  Paul and I believe they are necessary to the business, our cost structure is reasonable and will improve over time.

I want the phones and I want to be able to operate the business as we see fit.  If London has a bloated cost structure that is their issue and I don't want them to make it mine.

USA Allocations
I met with IT on Monday regarding my allocations and I still find them to be unacceptable.  For example, my overhead allocation is approximately half of Dan's, yet we have about 25% of the people working on our system.  I will discuss with Brent, but wanted you to know.

SPR implications are, in my opinion (given the available information) as follows:

SPR has  592 MMB of crude already in ground or in futures contracts.

Of that 592 MMB, 47 MMB are already purchased, or are owed to the SPR with delivery dates focused in the April 02 and Jan 03 window.

This means that 108 MMB will be bought through the royalty in kind method (oil in leu of tax dollars)

After talking to the head of the SPR division at the EIA he told me that some of that 108 MMB will be bought outright.  If they use the EIA's timeline, which is a max flow of oil into the SPR of 100,000 Bbl's a day then it takes 3 years to fill the remainin 108 MMB, if you take the 47 not in hand yet and add it to the oil they still need to purchase then it takes five years to fill the SPR to the max of 700 MMB

GLOBAL INVESTING: 'Business as usual' for weather derivatives 
Financial Times; Nov 15, 2001
By ALISON BEARD

When Enron, the energy trading company, became mired in controversy late last month, weather derivatives buyers were in danger of losing one of their top three market makers. But trading has not skipped a beat, according to industry sources.
"So far it's been business as usual," said Tom Stus, a trader at Axia Energy, which also sells risk protection to companies that depend on the weather, such as amusement park operators and ski resort owners.
"At one time Enron was a pretty significant player, but since they've been involved with these problems, they've probably slipped to the top 10 in terms of volume.
"We haven't seen them much in the over-the-counter market," he added. "But they're still online."
Dynegy, the company that plans to acquire Enron, also trades weather derivatives, as do a host of other commodity firms, insurers and some brokerages. Goldman Sachs, the Wall Street bank, and XL Capital, the Bermuda-based insurer, for example, recently entered the market, picking up Enron's slack, Mr Stus said.
"There's been no effect whatsoever," said Ravi Nathan, general manager at Aquila, another energy trader. "This market has a lot of capacity available."

            I've got 2 samples of fabric.  1 plain off white and the other
   a
         ribbed
            off
            white.  Elizabeth and I prefer the ribbed.
            Plain = $40 retail / $20 cost
            Ribbed = $50 retail  / $25 cost x 34 yards = $850
            I'll give them to you at cost so that we can continue
   furnishing
      your
            house
            ( I hear it's empty).
            If you have time this afternoon and can walk down to your Lobby
   I
      can
            meet
            you there to show you the fabrics.  Also, bring down a check so
      that
         I
            can
            stop by Walter Lee Culp and order you couches and fabric
   ma?ana.
         Fabric
            can
            be overnighted if needed or sent 2 day.
            I think 2 day is plenty of time.

            50% now - (not including taxes)
            50% later + shipping and taxes when couches are ready for
   delivery
         (6-8
            wks.).

            Need now
            $5445 for 2 loveseats and 1 couch + $850 for fabric = $6295
            I will give you a receipt.
            Let me know when you can see the fabric........

               Retail for couch is $5460 (saving $1170 about  27% lower)
               Retail for loveseat $4200 (saving $900 about 27% lower.)
               I may be able to save you more on the fabric if I can find
   the
      one
            you
               need
               at Kravets since they give me 50% off.  The majority of the
         furniture
               stores
               only give between a 20-30% off.  The couches take about 6-8
      weeks
         if
               they
               are in stock and usually are.  I'll get some fabric this
   Friday
            during
               lunch
               and maybe I can show you over coffee that afternoon.  I'll
   need
      to
            order
               the
               fabric so add another 2 weeks at least before the store gets
      it.
            Also,
               I'll
               find out paying conditions but usually is 50% upfront (cash)
      and
         then
               the
               other 50% when ready for delivery.  They don't take credit
      card.
            Checks
               payable to me and I pay with my company check.
               I'll get moving and call you on Friday.
               Sound good?

                  You need a total of 23.5 yards of fabric.  I usually get

H Robert,

Sorry for the delay, however you know it has been very busy these last several weeks at Enron.  Unfortunately, we are not hiring, and won't be for the foreseeable future.  It would be best if we could schedule a phone call sometime during December when I will have more time to help.

Regards,

Jeff

Mr. Shankman:

Thank you for getting back to me.

My interests lie in trading commodities and derivatives.  I know that Enron
is very much behind the move to commoditize many products and trade them
over electronic exchanges and feel that this is a strong position for the
digital future.  I think what Enron is doing is exciting and I would like to
speak with you about it and the opportunities it opens up to a person such

Jen,

I start 26 November in London on Chris's advice, as I haven't been able to
reach you.  I know that we said it might be best if my first month with
Enron were worked in Houston, but it now seems wisest to put that off for a
while.

Mike and Jeff:  

Yesterday, Harry Kingerski from Government Affairs testified before the Georgia state commission, advocating the use and benefits of weather derivatives.  Harry heads up our rates/technical division within Government Affairs - he has excellent technical skills and is very highly regarded by state commissioners nationwide.  I wanted to report back to you that Harry received very positive feedback from various groups attending the hearing.  He commented to me this morning that the Commissioners were very attentive when he discussed weather products, and basically snoozed through the remainder of the hearing!!  He has recommended to Mark's group that we talk directly to the Commissioners (outside of the litigation process) to further educate them on our products.     

We are also advocating weather products in other state proceedings, as opportunities arise.  All of this work is being done internally within Government Affairs, drawing upon various areas of expertise.   

We will keep plugging away, but wanted you to know that, so far, we are getting good feedback!!

Subject:	Georgia Power Rate Case

Yesterday, we were cross-examined on our testimony at hearings before the Georgia Public Service Commission.  One of the main points in our testimony was that Georgia Power should be required to use weather hedges to mitigate weather-related volume risk.  We made the point that hedges would be superior to the revenue sharing approach proposed by Georgia Power, and could save customers significant amounts of money.

Although a final PSC decision isn't scheduled until early in December, there were a couple of positive signs at the hearing.  Several othere intervenors, including Commission staff, talked to us informally about the idea and seemed to see benefit in the weather hedging approach.  Also, the 4 commissioners seemed particularly attentive when we described the weather issue during the hearing (a noticeable difference, compared to their attention on most issues).

We may have opportunity to visit informally with the commissioners later in November.  If we can arrange it, would one of you be interested in giving a brief overview of the weather market and the participants (the on-the-shelf presentation you have would be fine)?   This could help with their final decision.

On a different front, we are planning an intervention in a Gulf Power rate case in Florida to promote weather hedging.  Bob and I think the issues there are similar.  Our due date for testimony there is early in December. 

Thanks to each of you for helping us prepare the materials for these cases.

Jeffrey:

Thanks for taking the time to step out into the heat to "dine" with me. As
always; it was a pleasure catching up (ever so briefly). Per our discussion,
my post-Belco career move will most likely be to a) a Financial Control
post in an energy company, b) Risk/Financial Control consulting or c) tbd
other intellectually challenging position. I've attached my resume for you
to
send on to Joe Gold at MG -- if he's interested in adding staff to his NY
operation. If he's not interested -- it's okay, I appreciate your thoughts
& support anyway.

On another note...please make some quality time for me (and my husband)
next time your in Manhattan. If you give us some notice, we'll book a great
dinner spot.

In the meantime, I hope the summer associate party was enjoyable--next time,
I suggest
renting a fun public venue...or hire a professional caterer!

Stay happy & healthy, and don't sweat the little things!

Hi Christie,
                   I just received your response and tried calling to thank you for interviewing me yesterday. Your personal and prompt email is truly representative of Enron's ability to not only hire but also retain the best and the brightest. Up until today I have found no recruiter to bring out the problematic issues of a firm. The very fact that you put Enron's current problems on the table shows how strongly and genuinely you feel about the firm being secure and stable. I really appreciated you letting me defend Enron; it not only shows you my passion but also reiterates my genuine interest in the firm.
I am writing to let you know that I had second rounds today as you know and in the first interview, which was supposed to be conducted by Jen Fraser but was conducted by Matt, a first year analyst, the concern was on GPA and academic performance rather that what value I can add or my keen interest in the firm. I was extremely shaken after this first interview; in the interview right after, Sarah, an associate, did manage to alleviate some of my concerns. However, I was wondering if this could possibly serve as a road block in the recruiting process as I really do not believe that my GPA is low or an accurate representation of my capabilities to perform on the job. I honestly feel that a 3.2 at Wharton equates to a much higher GPA at any other school in the United States.
Although disheartened, I am extremely interested in Enron as a firm and am confident that if given the chance I will emerge as one of your most valued candidates. Thank you so very much.

Sincerely,
Aziz.

I had a conversation yesterday with Paul Burgener, Corp Risk Mgr, at DTE in Detroit. He told me that cash transactions with Enron are "business as usual" but that all term trades now receive increased scrutiny and                                                    are to be avoided, particularly if a reasonable substitute exists.Though he did not go so far as to say we were cut off, it's clear to Paul's group that term trades with Enron are not career enhancers.

Jeff,

Any insight?  I'll bring this up with Nowlan tomorrow.  We have companies looking for LPG swaps and while we appreciate recent volatility, when can we move forward?

Incidently, we lost out on a WTI swap with Mitsui OSK the other day when another trader called them (at midnight) to close the trade on the recent dip.

Jeremy;

Even though market has dropped a lot, our trader in London ( Bo Petersen ) is not ready to trade anything longer than a month. According to him, the market is too volatile at this moment and cannot take that risk.

Gentlemen,

Please note that part of Eric Shaw's responsibility is LNG asset development. One of my 2002 objectives is to develop an European LNG terminal. It would appear we need to reach an understanding with EEL on where EGM responsibilities stop. Lets discuss.

I really don't think this is the direction I want to head in,
but (as always) thanks for the support. I'm looking for a treasury/
risk control position, and I'm speaking with a number of regional
power cos. and consulting orgs. Do you know the people at The New
Power Company in CT?

Hi Ronney,  I just spoke to Joe, and the only thing he is looking to add in
NY is a more junior person to cover the hedge funds.  If you are interested
in that, he'd love to talk to you.

I'm not sure how much help that is.

 Have a great weekend.

Subject:	FW: Georgia Power Rate Case

Mike and Jeff:  

Yesterday, Harry Kingerski from Government Affairs testified before the Georgia state commission, advocating the use and benefits of weather derivatives.  Harry heads up our rates/technical division within Government Affairs - he has excellent technical skills and is very highly regarded by state commissioners nationwide.  I wanted to report back to you that Harry received very positive feedback from various groups attending the hearing.  He commented to me this morning that the Commissioners were very attentive when he discussed weather products, and basically snoozed through the remainder of the hearing!!  He has recommended to Mark's group that we talk directly to the Commissioners (outside of the litigation process) to further educate them on our products.     

We are also advocating weather products in other state proceedings, as opportunities arise.  All of this work is being done internally within Government Affairs, drawing upon various areas of expertise.   

We will keep plugging away, but wanted you to know that, so far, we are getting good feedback!!

Subject:	Georgia Power Rate Case

Yesterday, we were cross-examined on our testimony at hearings before the Georgia Public Service Commission.  One of the main points in our testimony was that Georgia Power should be required to use weather hedges to mitigate weather-related volume risk.  We made the point that hedges would be superior to the revenue sharing approach proposed by Georgia Power, and could save customers significant amounts of money.

Although a final PSC decision isn't scheduled until early in December, there were a couple of positive signs at the hearing.  Several othere intervenors, including Commission staff, talked to us informally about the idea and seemed to see benefit in the weather hedging approach.  Also, the 4 commissioners seemed particularly attentive when we described the weather issue during the hearing (a noticeable difference, compared to their attention on most issues).

We may have opportunity to visit informally with the commissioners later in November.  If we can arrange it, would one of you be interested in giving a brief overview of the weather market and the participants (the on-the-shelf presentation you have would be fine)?   This could help with their final decision.

On a different front, we are planning an intervention in a Gulf Power rate case in Florida to promote weather hedging.  Bob and I think the issues there are similar.  Our due date for testimony there is early in December. 

Thanks to each of you for helping us prepare the materials for these cases.

Monday's OOC staff meeting was set aside for me to share with you the logistics around the upcoming layoffs.  The latest information is that layoffs will not occur until Wednesday (11/28) or Thursday (11/29).  The HR Leads will not receive the logistics information until Monday evening, so I think we will need to re-schedule our meeting for Tuesday morning.

Please consider your travel plans as the layoff date will not be Tuesday, 11/27 as originally scheduled.

If I receive more information over the weekend, I will pass it on to you.

Thanks,
Shanna

Given the volatility in the gas market (which is the sole impact on the Canadian power book's US dollar exposure) and the exhorbitant cost involved in hedging multi-year cashflows (i.e. as evidenced by Friday 10/19/2001 trade of -$1,200,000 Cdn new deal value for the 14 year swap that I entered into), I will manage the currency exposure of this book myself, I will hedge appropriately when I see fit and will not accept hedges forced on Enron Canada because of arbitrary position limits set by your department.

Chris was on the way to the airport so he asked me to send you a note 

Over the last five days the mahoney/o'brien books have lost 1 million dollars on vega against calendar 2002  19/30 brent short strangle.
vol for cal 02 is now 42.5 pct and we feel this is not a good level at which to cover this position, however the market appears liquid enough to close out if required. 

Today i have rolled 330 mb short cracks in q1 and q2 effectively reducing that exposure by two thirds, i expect to have the rest covered tomorrow 

I plan to maintain jet and kero diff shorts as this market is still under considerable pressure. prompt barrels trading at 17.50 over, deferred paper values are still in the high twenties, and airline demand shows no sign of improvement.

If you want to talk to chris i expect he will be available around 9.30 pm london time.

i also have a 1-sheet strategy brief that i wanted to go over w/ you & mike earlier.  we should come back to that now.

I'd love to catch up, and will do so shortly.  As I always tell my guys, if your job doesn't change one day to the next, keep doing your job.

Subject:	Off-site Presentations
Importance:	High

As EGM concludes its first year of business, we have shown that there is real health, success and future opportunities for our businesses.  Our importance to the success of Enron is clear.  Now we would like to review our first year.  In your presentations at the off-site meeting next week, Mike and I would like each of the presenters to outline the following: your business' biggest success and biggest failure; what was different from original market observations, and did this help or hurt business; lessons learned and what you would do differently; and your best opportunities for next year.  I know that time is short but hopefully this will not be too difficult with your recent 2002 plan work.  

Please prepare your presentation in PowerPoint with a simple format and no graphics or background. Each presenter will be given approximately 30 minutes to speak. All PowerPoint files are due to Jennifer Burns via email by no later than 1:00pm on Monday, October 15.

Thank you,
Mike and Jeff

Hi Jason,

I hope the Dallas, Texas show was good for you guys, and of course, it
was nice seeing you again.  Also, the two times I came by at the NY show
last weekend, you guys were swamped!  I'm sorry I didn't stop by again,
but my frined started feeling badly, and we left for a while.

I remember your telling me in Dallas that a small early (1950's?)
pitcher was going to be available now the the museum wasn't going to
pursue it, and the price was around $32,000.  Is that piece available?
I'm interested and would like to talk to you about it.

Best Regards,

Jeff Shankman

Subject:	Reinsurance impact update report: 9/24

Attached is our updated report on the Sept. 11 impact on the insurance/reinsurance industry.  We appreciate your feedback and will provide updated reports upon receipt of further follow-up questions/taskings.

Executive Summary
Immediate short-term impacts are already being felt in the global aviation sector.  Japan's two leading airlines have seen their rates rise sevenfold, amounting to almost US$140 million.  The US airline industry has already secured US$15 billion in government-sponsored financial help, including assistance with insurance and liability issues for the next six months.  
Sources concede that the industry will be forced to change its focus back to risk analysis and be less customer acquisition-focused (in the sense that premiums will need to rise to compensate).  Moody's has already indicated that several insurance and reinsurance companies will be rated negatively following the impact of the attacks.
Other generally accepted long-term impacts include a reduced capital base, higher risks and expected losses, acquisition of smaller players, better investment opportunities for insurers and reinsurers, and possible government involvement.
Several well-informed industry sources have serious doubts about Lloyd's stability.  Most of their policies are not guaranteed.  Significant Lloyd's shareholders such as Ace and XL are also negatively impacted.  
Table 1 shows revised claims estimates to date for the major insurance and reinsurance companies.
Table 2 shows total estimated losses and change in stock price to date for the major insurance and reinsurance companies.

Jeff- thanks very much for your support of our Energy News Today concept. We will talk to John Nowlan immediately, but based on your commitment today, we will proceed with the one year 360K commitment to ENT.  As mentioned, we had to act quickly to prevent the sources from being bought out by Petroleum Argus.  ENT has accepted our offer and the reporting will continue uninterrupted.

Attached below is Clay's memo on ENT for your reference.

Cheers,

RJ

Retail for couch is $5460 (saving $1170 about  27% lower)
Retail for loveseat $4200 (saving $900 about 27% lower.)
I may be able to save you more on the fabric if I can find the one you need
at Kravets since they give me 50% off.  The majority of the furniture stores
only give between a 20-30% off.  The couches take about 6-8 weeks if they
are in stock and usually are.  I'll get some fabric this Friday during lunch
and maybe I can show you over coffee that afternoon.  I'll need to order the
fabric so add another 2 weeks at least before the store gets it.  Also, I'll
find out paying conditions but usually is 50% upfront (cash) and then the
other 50% when ready for delivery.  They don't take credit card.  Checks
payable to me and I pay with my company check.
I'll get moving and call you on Friday.
Sound good?

Holy cow this is expensive.  Of course I don't care about your 5% or so,
but what is the retail on these babies?  I'm pretty flexible on the
fabric--mid range would be fine.  Let's move ahead.  (2 loveseats though,
not 1)  How long did they say?

   Sofa = $4290
   Loveseat = $3300
   8.25% tax = $626.18.
   Total = $8,216.18.  Both w/out fabric.

   You need a total of 23.5 yards of fabric.  I usually get about a 30-35%
   discount on fabric so if you are OK with the couch prices, I can go to
   the
   Decorative Center and get some fabric samples for you to choose from.  I
   have no clue as to how much indoor/outdoor fabric goes for but I'll get
   a
   range so that you can see the difference between the cheaper and
   expensive
   type.  Let me know how you would like to proceed.

   Hi Tina,

   Thanks for you help.

   The site is www.thewickerworks.com.  Click on it to go directly there.
   The are in Houston at Walter Lee Culp.  713 623 4670.

   If you go to their web site go to the home page, then to the tab that
   says wicker, then to the tab that says more.  The design is Helva.

   I need 1 Helva sofa, and 2 Helva loveseats, of course in a very plain
   off white (not tan as one of the pictures shows) indoor/outdoor fabric.

   Or if you have any other ideas, let me know, of course.

   Regards,

   Jeff

The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.

Dear Mr. Shankman,

Thank you for authorizing me to sell the Martin Puryear sculpture "Bower"
owned by Enron Corp. A major American museum has expressed serious interest
in purchasing this Martin Puryear sculpture and the museum has an
acquisition meeting early next week when they expect to make a decision
about the purchase.

The museum has certain budget restrictions and I have been asked to find out
if it would be possible to pay $500,000.00 this year and the $285,000.00
balance in October 2002. If this schedule of payment is acceptable, it will
make the acquisition of the Puryear likely.

The November 8th email authorizing me to sell the Puryear does not include a
term. Since I am in the midst of negotiating the Puryear's sale, I would
appreciate assurance that Michael Rosenfeld Gallery will remain the sole and
exclusive authorized  agent for the sale of the sculpture through the end of
2001. Also, in light of recent developments with the acquisition of Enron by
Dynergy, I would appreciate assurance that sale of the Puryear may continue
unobstructed and that there will be no problem with transfer of title.
Naturally, this is a very important point.

Thank you and I look forward to hearing from you.


Sincerely,
Michael Rosenfeld

Jeff,
I work with Jennifer Fraser and was asked to contact you with regards to a fuel oil call that we sold Hydro Quebec a while ago. I would like to find out whether or not we are in the notification period (I think we are) and what kind of paper work that needs to get done if we are.

David, aware of these regulations and hence that is why we have the established channels of approval - in this instance there is obviously need for more caution. However this has now been on the radar screen for some time and when we think issue resolved it is seemingly not - hence we need to address asap.

cheers
Jez

Jez our concerns are not just an internal approval issue. Under Australian Law the Directors of ECAPPL need to be satisfied when a company incurs a debt that it can be paid. Failure to discharge this duty can mean the directors would be personally for the debt. If the Coal Group is comfortable to make to enter into these commitments   then that is the obvious way forward. One of the Coal Group in the Sydney office (presumably Paul McPhee) could replace Heidi Mason as resident director.

Subject:	RE: Bengalla Biz

We seem to be going round in circle's here and hence hopefully all the relevant people are now on copy of this e-mail so we can resolve swiftly. This cargo is due to be shipped in seven days with the coal already being railed to port. It is coal which will be shipped to service European commitments and represents the cheapest way to do so taking all costs into account (including financing). Needless to say if we pull out of this deal at this stage it will have huge ramifications with our customer and send all the wrong signals to our counterparties in this part of the world. Last but not least we will need to look elsewhere to procure coal for these European sales at what is likely to be a higher price.

Appreciate the green light.

Jez

George:

Details on the cargo we are loading out of Newcastle.  Sailing time is roughly 45 days.  Cargo to be sold to ARA/German customers, most with payment terms 5 days post delivery.  Also - it would help to get an idea of how diificult this exercise will be in the coming months, as we have a couple more loading before year end.

Work it,

Stu

Stu,

I refer to your e-mail to Jez last week and advise you the expected payment value and timing etc.

Vessel name:	MV "Cotsworld"
ETA:		21/Nov 
ETS:		22/Nov
Loading tonnage: approx. 128kmt (9kmt from Stratford and 119kmt from Bengalla)
Payment value and timing :	
		Value		Timing	
 Bengalla:	US$3.3mil(*)	19th (**)
 Stratford:	US$0.2mil(*)	26th  		

* Inclusive of 10% GST
** Bengall has already delivered 49kmt of coal to port and will complete the delivery on 15th. 
The contract is based on FIS and the invoice weight and quality be determined by the inbound analysis while they take des/dem risk.
Because of their concern over our credit Bengalla has insisted on our payment by TT against the presentation of documents. Docs are likely to be 
presented on 16th or 19th at the latest. 

The draft contract which Bengalla has confirmed has a provision that the invoice weight is determined based on B/L quantity instead of inbound rail weight 
if we take 100% of Bengalla coal onto our vessel. If we do that, they can not present their docs until the vessel has compeleted the loading and our payment date would be say 26th instead.

Regards,


Tark

Mr. Shankman:

My name is Robert Brown and I am a fellow alumnus of the Wharton School.  I
noticed that you provided your name on the Penn Career Network as a mentor
for other alumni.  I have just returned from a sabbatical and am currently
seeking to enter the energy industry in Houston now that I have returned
stateside.  As a person who has achieved a prominent position in the
industry in which I am interested, I thought you might be able to help me in
my endeavors with some advice.

Would it be possible for me to contact you at a convenient time, so that I
might be able to ask you a few questions?  Please feel free to call me on my
cell phone at 832.541.5805 or you can also reach me through e-mail by
responding to this e-mail.  Thank you for making yourself available to other
alumni like myself.  I look forward to speaking to you.

Jeff,  

I'm headed through Houston for Thanksgiving.  I was wondering if you might be available on Friday, November 16th for a quick visit.  Just wanted both to stop by and visit with you and to see the new trading floor.

Let me know when you have a chance.

Thanks,

Hi,
Attached is my mom's resume for board consideration.  What can I say? I don't know what if anything you can do with this, but I can now say I forwarded it to you.  Watch out, my own resume may be following shortly (arggh!).  Amazon said they never received the return of the books I sent you.  How are you?
HOpe all is well and you are not too mosquito bitten or rain drenched.
Love, 
Sam

I've spoken with Shanna this morning about Rob Fuller, and my need to keep him here for the next couple of months.  She relayed to me that it would be appropriate now to let him know of a gauranteed payment of $200,000 to him if he is here Feb 4, as long as he was performing to a satisfactory level.  

He is probably one of two or three that I need to do this with ( the others less pressing), and I will be communicating with Rob today about this.

Thanks 


Jeff

F/y/i-- See article below -- It looks like there may be a shortage of terminal capacity (and some surplus LNG supply) for awhile.

Hi Carol, I was thinking about a few more shirts.  You really need to have a referral discount or some other incentive program for your clients.  It may help.

Subject:	Can you help me?

I was wondering if you might be able to help me.  I need to finish strong
this year.  I am attempting to reach the goal of $336,000 in clothing sales
by the end of the year.  Obviously, no single client will be able to help me
do this.  So I was wondering if you might be able to help me out by giving
me the names of some qualified gentlemen or ladies that might be interested
in the type of service we offer.

Some things to consider:

We offer ready-made (off the rack) clothing as well as custom.
We offer all types of men's clothing including casual.

If you know of some mid to upper level executive women, they may have an
interest as well.

Some memory joggers:

Who is the best dressed man or woman you know?
Who do you know that likes nice cars?
Who do you know that owns their own company?
Who do you know that is successful in sales?
Who do you know that wears an expensive watch?
Who do you know that owns their own airplane?
Who do you know that might have a hard time fitting in typical clothing?

Thanks for your help!

Weather: 

1.) Physically locate 2 individuals on EES product floor that will focus solely on weather products to our retail customer base, they should be sitting here now. 
2.) Have at least one weather product fully developed/structured and ready to roll-out to the sales folks in the targeted customer channel. The timeline on this was        Monday, September 10th. Be sure you have a weather contract fully developed and sign-off from retail legal (Vicki Sharp).

Heating Oil/Propane:

1.) Have one person identified to manage both products together. Physically locate them on same floor with EES product development. Timeframe on this was this week.

I'd like to set up a meeting with both of you, Jeremy, Vicki and myself to review the product and marketing approach before we roll it out to the sales force.

Subject:	SUPER BOWL & MASTERS

Enron's Sports Marketing Group is reviewing proposals from outside vendors for the 2002 Super Bowl and The Masters.  In order to negotiate the best possible customer entertainment packages, I need to determine the interest level within EA, EIM and EGM for participation in these two major sporting events.  On behalf of your perspective companies, please let me know if you are interested in participating and if so, how many spaces you will require for each.

Once we determine the interest level corporate-wide and we negotiate the costs, a detailed outline of these events will be distributed to each of you for your final approval.
Thank you for your assistance.

John, 

I don't have all the facts around this transaction, but I don't think you are authorized to hedge currency exposure with outside counterparties as you've outlined in your email to Hickerson, etc.  I'd appreciate some information.

Jeff-

Can you believe it! What's there not to love. It is the  finest
mural/painting of its kind I have seen available since the great TH Benton
mural cycle purchased by Equitable. Historically and qualitatively,
Lewandowski is at the top of the second tier of industrial/precisionist/
social realist painters after artists like Benton and Charles Sheeler. This
is a "machine age" masterpiece that epitomizes the glorification of the
worker and industry- a message Enron should appreciate.

The Lewandowski is a 103" x 67 oil on canvas executed in 1942. It came off
the wall of a building in Milwaukee where Lewandowski lived and worked
during the 1930s-40s.
The condition is quite good with almost no inpainting and a few horizontal
crinkles in the canvas.

The Greenville County Museum of Art had the Lewandowski on final
approval,but they hesitated today and I just committed to buy it as it sat
at the museum.

The price is $275,000.00 which is higher than any of Lewandowski's other
works, but this is monumental and unlike any other work. I hope youw ill
agree taht the price is reasonable for a painting of such scale, quality,
and historical significance.

Lewandowski's good early industrial watercolors of this era, 18" x 24" +/-,
have sold for $50,000.00+++. The "Circuit Breakers" painting I own that you
have seen at the gallery is priced at $150,000.00 and it is close to being
sold. I think Southwestern Bell has a Lewandowski watercolor and I know I
recently saw an 1939 industrial  Lewandowski painting hanging at the Dallas
Museum of Art.

The Lewandowski will be shipped to me from the Greenville County Museum in
the coming weeks and I hope you and others at Enron can arrange to see it.

-Michael

Jeff,

We have been working to try and get the crude products available in yen, but have not had much luck after Darren left.  You can see the general summary of the situation below.  We'd like to get the product up and believe that with some basic publicity it could be quite successful.  Any ideas on how to overcome these points?

Joe

After spending some time with Houston and London people over the past 2 weeks, the conclusion is that George cannot be up and running within the next 2-3 months. Obtaining live FX quotes is the major issue. Options that we considered were:

(a) Connect up to a bank's FX online system

Shane Dallman (UK) identified potential issues with this, the main one being technical issues associated with the EOL application. After consulting with EOL people, it appears the FX manager application is not suitable for linking to an external party at the moment. They are working on these issues as part of a larger development project but I cannot get a clear timetable out of them

(b) Get Thomas Cheng to run the FX manager

Issues include: 
* Thomas doesn't feel comfortable having to watch the FX market on a real time basis and update prices accordingly, given most of his time is spent on metals
* In that case, FX group would like automatic updates of the FX price from the market so he would not have to watch it all the time (we then get back to IT issues which Shane is checking out)

(c) Get a FX trader in Japan

The FX group is currently considering their staffing requirements but Pushkar Shahi (Director, FX Houston) said that there are no immediate plans to get someone out here.

I will keep monitoring the FX situation. Perhaps if you have time next week, you could speak to Gary Hickerson to get his thoughts.

Regards
Rousseau

I hear you on the vol, but it hasn't paid off.  I want everyone to focus on their expertise.  Focus on the underlying business is crucial, and chris mentioned to me that no one in London is an experienced daily vol trader.  I would like you guys to get out.

Chris was on the way to the airport so he asked me to send you a note 

Over the last five days the mahoney/o'brien books have lost 1 million dollars on vega against calendar 2002  19/30 brent short strangle.
vol for cal 02 is now 42.5 pct and we feel this is not a good level at which to cover this position, however the market appears liquid enough to close out if required. 

Today i have rolled 330 mb short cracks in q1 and q2 effectively reducing that exposure by two thirds, i expect to have the rest covered tomorrow 

I plan to maintain jet and kero diff shorts as this market is still under considerable pressure. prompt barrels trading at 17.50 over, deferred paper values are still in the high twenties, and airline demand shows no sign of improvement.

If you want to talk to chris i expect he will be available around 9.30 pm london time.

Hi Ben,  

Hope the show ended up great for you guys.

Would you mind breaking down the last invoice (four objects) by object so I know the bill for each.  I'd like to send some dough.

Have a great thanksgiving if we don't talk before then--I'm leaving wed for Kentucky, then London.

Best to all,

Jeff

Let's plan to get together.  Maybe you'll come over to our humble little pad
and have a nice home-cooked meal.  Hillary is a really good cook.

I am sorry I didn't invite you to the wedding, Jeff.  I was going to and
then changed my mind when you seemed so stressed and hassled by your
work/travel schedule.  I didn't want you to feel obliged to travel if you
didn't want to.  I should have asked you your preference.  I hope you
understand.

I'm so glad you're okay, relatively speaking.  You're a great guy, Jeff, and
I hope that this experience helps you and me and everybody around us to
focus on what's actually important in our lives, and to be especially kind
to each other.

Please tell me when you're coming around

Warm Regards,
ben

HOUSTON (AP) - Shares of embattled Enron Corp. plunged another 32 percent W=

.=20
In a report released Wednesday, Goldman Sachs & Co. analyst David Fleischer=

 the Houston-based company earlier this week "raised new issues about liqui=

Fleischer acknowledged, however, Enron's efforts to renegotiate next week's=

dications that Enron's banks may be willing to roll current maturities over=
 and even make new equity investments.=20
Michelle Foss, director of the Energy Institute at the University of Housto=

"It doesn't look like it's going to be able to happen," Foss said. "It did =

Enron Gets Extension on $690 Mln Note Due Next Week (Update1)
2001-11-21 12:38 (New York)

Enron Gets Extension on $690 Mln Note Due Next Week (Update1)

     (Updates with amount of debt in fourth paragraph.)

     Houston, Nov. 21 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., whose shares had
dropped 92 percent this year amid a financial crisis, said lenders
extended to mid-December the payment date on a $690 million note
due next week.

     Enron, which agreed to be bought out by rival energy trader
Dynegy Inc. in a transaction now valued at more than $23 billion,
said earlier this week a drop in its credit rating may force it to
repay the $690 million note. The repayment would strain cash
reserves Enron needs to back its trading operations, investors and
analysts said.

     The Houston-based company didn't say in its release who holds
the note, which is owed by an affiliated partnership that owns
Brazilian natural-gas assets and was backed by Enron.
     The note is held by a group of banks led by the Citibank unit
of Citigroup Inc., Standard & Poor's said in a press release
yesterday.

      Enron also is in discussions with other lenders on a
restructuring of its debt, the company said in a statement
distributed by PR Newswire.

     ``We believe the interests of Chase and Enron's other primary
lenders are aligned in this restructuring effort,'' James Lee,
vice president of JP Morgan Chase & Co., said in the Enron
statement. ``We will work with Enron and its other primary lenders
to develop a plan to strengthen Enron's financial position up to
and through its merger with Dynegy.'' Morgan has been advising
Enron on its merger with Dynegy.

     Enron said yesterday it may have to pay $9.15 billion in debt
due by 2003, suggesting the company may run out of cash before the
merger closes. Dynegy has said the merger should close before the
end of the third quarter of 2002.

      Enron said in a regulatory filing that it has less than $2
billion in cash or credit lines.

     Shares of Enron, the most active stock in U.S. trading, fell
$1.79, or 23 percent, to $5.20 in midday trading. Before the
announcement that it had renegotiated the $690 million note, its
shares had fallen as much as 42.78 percent, the lowest level in
more than a decade.

     Dynegy fell $2.50, or 6 percent, to $39.20. Shares of
ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns 26 percent of Dynegy, rose 49
cents to  $87.02



Enron, Dynegy Shares Fall 2nd Day on Threat to Buyout (Update2)
2001-11-21 11:49 (New York)

Enron, Dynegy Shares Fall 2nd Day on Threat to Buyout (Update2)

     (Adds analyst comment in fourth paragraph.)

     Houston, Nov. 21, (Bloomberg) -- Shares of Enron Corp., the
biggest energy trader, and Dynegy Inc. fell for a second day on
concern Enron may run out of cash before its takeover by Dynegy
can be completed.

     Enron tumbled as much as 33 percent, and Dynegy dropped as
much as 6.7 percent. Enron's bonds also fell. The company's 6.4
percent notes maturing in July 2006 were bid at 62 cents and
offered at 66 cents, traders said. They sold at about 72 cents
yesterday.

     Institutional investors sold shares of both companies after
Goldman, Sachs & Co. analyst David Fleischer downgraded them to
``market perform'' from his ``recommend'' list, other analysts
said.

     The Dynegy bid ``did not eliminate customer concerns about
Enron's liquidity and long-term viability,'' Goldman Sachs said
in its report. ``We now believe that it will be difficult for
Enron shares to generate strong returns until it is clear that
Enron can operate on a normal basis without having to provide
cash or letters of credit to back routine transactions.''

     Fleischer also cut his 2002 profit estimate for Enron to 50
cents from $1.35. Enron had been expected to make $1.90 next
year, the average estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by Thomson
Financial/First Call.

     Enron said Monday it may have to pay $9.15 billion in debt
due by 2003, suggesting the Houston-based energy trader may run
out of cash. The company said in a regulatory filing it has less
than $2 billion in cash or credit lines.

     It also surprised some investors by saying a drop in its
credit rating may force it to repay a $690 million note next
week. Enron said yesterday the terms of the notes, which it
guaranteed for an affiliated partnership that owns Brazilian
natural-gas assets, are being renegotiated and that it had a
``verbal indications'' that the maturity of the notes will be
extended.

     The company's dealings with affiliated partnerships led to
earnings restatements, credit-rating cuts, a federal
investigation and a management shakeup. Dynegy plans to complete
its buyout by October, and Enron may have to ask lenders to
restructure payment schedules.

     Mirant Corp., Aquila Inc. and other big energy traders are
doing fewer transactions with Enron as concerns increase about
its credit rating and ability to finance daily business,
executives said yesterday.

     Enron's stock fell $2.28, or 32 percent, to $4.71 in
late-morning trading. Earlier, it touched $4.67, its lowest price
in more than a decade. The shares have plummeted 92 percent this
year. Dynegy fell $2.70, or 6.5 percent, to $39.00. The shares
had dropped 26 percent this year.



U.S. Equity Movers: Cardiac Science, Enron, Guidant, TriQuint

U.S. Equity Movers: Cardiac Science, Enron, Guidant, TriQuint

     New York, Nov. 21 (Bloomberg) -- The following is a list of
companies whose shares are moving in U.S. markets Wednesday, Nov.
21. The stock symbol is in parentheses after the company name.

Major Moving Stocks:

     Enron Corp. (ENE) fell $1.54, or 22 percent, to $5.45 and
traded as low as $5.44. The energy trader shares fell for a second
day on concern Enron may run out of cash before its takeover by
Dynegy Inc. (DYN) can be completed.

Other Moving Stocks:

     Cardiac Science Inc. (DFIB) rose 51 cents, or 16 percent, to
$3.65 and traded as high as $3.89. The maker of equipment used to
restore a normal heartbeat to patients in cardiac arrest said the
San Diego City Council approved an agreement for the company to
deploy automated external defibrillators in the region. The
company made the announcement in a press release distributed by PR
Newswire. Officials couldn't immediately be reached to comment.

     Guidant Corp. (GDT) rose $4.18, or 8.9 percent, to $51 and
traded as high as $51.50. The maker of products to treat heart
disease said a study showed implantable defibrillators cut deaths
by 30 percent in heart-attack survivors, potentially expanding the
$1.9 billion market for the product.

     Portal Software Inc. (PRSF) fell 34 cents, or 15 percent, to
$1.89 and traded as low as $1.64. The provider of Internet-billing
programs said in a release distributed by Business Wire that it
forecasts a loss of 9 cents to 10 cents a share in the fourth
quarter ending Jan. 31. The company is expected to lose 11 cents,
the average estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call. Officials
couldn't be reached to comment.

     TriQuint Semiconductor Inc. (TQNT) fell $1.99, or 10 percent,
to $17.56 and traded as low as $17.35. The communications-
equipment chipmaker said it would report fourth- and first-quarter
results at the low end of previous forecasts. TriQuint was cut to
``neutral'' from ``buy'' in a report by U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray
Cos. analyst Samuel May.

Tickers: ENE DFIB GDT TQNT

     Money flows, the difference between the value of trades made
at a higher price than the previous trade and those made at a
lower price, may also appear for some stocks. These inflows and
outflows show whether people are willing to pay more for a stock
that's rising, or to sell a stock that's falling for less. If not
it's a signal the share price may soon change direction.

DYNEGY, ENRON SAY MERGER TO PROCEED

By Myra P. Saefong

1:52 PM ET Nov 21, 2001

WASHINGTON (CBS.MW) -- Merger partners Enron and Dynegy restated their
commitment Wednesday to completing a deal, on the heels of embattled
Enron's announcement that its lead lender granted it more time to pay
off a $690 million note set to come due next week.

"We are continuing our confirmatory due diligence and working to
accelerate the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger,"
said Chuck Watson, Dynegy's chairman and chief executive,  in a
statement.

Shares of Enron (ENE) recovered slightly in afternoon  trading but
remained under pressure.


On heavy volume, the stock -- which had touched $4 earlier in the
session -- was down $1.83 to trade at $5.16, a new 10-year low. Some 84
million shares had changed hands.

Enron declined 23 percent Tuesday after the company revealed the
upcoming debt deadline and restated its earnings.

Meanwhile, Dynegy shares lost $1.83 to stand at $39.87.

Enron said that the lead bank on the $690 million debt agreed to extend
the maturity date to mid-December, which will give the company time to
restructure the facility, and added it expects to further restructure
its debt.

"We ... believe we can identify a mutually beneficial restructuring to
enhance our cash position, strengthen our balance sheet, and address
upcoming maturities," said Jeff McMahon, chief financial officer, in a
statement.

J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. said it and other lenders are committed to
helping Enron improve its financial position.

Also, Enron reaffirmed its commitment to a merger with Dynegy and said
it closed on a previously announced $450 million line of credit from
J.P. Morgan, collateralized by the company's Northern Natural Gas Co.

Enron -- which is being acquired by its smaller rival Dynegy (DYN) at a
fire-sale price -- revealed in a Securities and Exchange Commission
filing Monday that it had to pay off or refinance $690 million in debt
obligations by next Monday or risk triggering nearly $4 billion in
additional payments.

If Enron had missed that deadline and didn't post collateral, investors
had the right to demand immediate liquidation of the assets of one of
Enron's limited partnerships, the unusual business entities at the
center of the company's murky transactions currently under
investigation.

The SEC filing of Monday also contained yet another restatement of
financial results on the heels of a similar filing that disclosed more
than four years of restated earnings figures.
<http://cbs.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=3D%7B35D690E0%2D13BE%2D43D9=
%2D9644%2D1B1CF4896115%7D>

Earlier Wednesday, Goldman Sachs lowered its rating on Enron's stock to
"market performer" from its "U.S. recommended list," citing "major"
liquidity issues and concerns over whether the company can recover the
business it has lost.

CIBC World Markets also cut Enron to a "hold" from a "buy."

Commerzbank weighed in Wednesday, saying Enron's viability is in doubt.

"We believe the filing clearly shows that Enron remains in a precarious
financial position and its status as a going concern is much in doubt,"
analysts Andre Meade and Andrew Smith wrote. "It appears that Enron's
situation could worsen in a number of ways."

Though Enron's most recent disclosures shed more light on the fiscal
situation, Meade and Smith characterized the information as "piecemeal."

"It appears that the full extent of Enron's problems is not currently
known," they said in a note, cautioning clients against investing in
Enron.

Hi Jeff:

I know you are heading out of town tomorrow and are swamped but I just
wanted to check in with you to see if you had made it to the Moderne Gallery
in Philly to see the Nakashima exhibition.  Any comments on any of the
pieces if you did see the show?

Thanks for your help,

Hi John, 

 I will be in London sometime next week and was hoping to look at the knox cup, or experience the miracle of your finding the little dresser 3 legged conical bowl I want.  In any event, I'd like to have the option of getting the 7800 pounds back if nothing materializes.  As you know, Enron is undergoing very hard times, and I have a lot of loose ends that I'd like to manage.  I'm off for the Thanksgiving holiday for the next few days, and hope you have a great weekend.

Best regards,

Jeff

So far this quarter we've spend about 18 million on a reserve that Randy Petersen/Credit are making us take on an option we have associated with the MTBE project.  In essence, Randy P doesn't understand how we trade options at Enron, and I'll be having a conversation with Rick about this.  We've spent almost 5 million in getting out of physical positions since no one will buy from or sell to us.  We can't manage the physical positions and obligations we have since there is no money available to the crude group (to purchase physical or post LC's in the case of a sale).  Wev'e also spent about 10+ million closing down books and getting out of positions as the market gives us the chance.  More than half the books have been closed and we will close/consolidate four more tonight.  As you know, getting out of any positions costs money, and the market smells blood.

Because the crude and products markets have been moving significantly recently, we can't manage our options position by getting out of them.  Again, nobody will buy from us or sell options to us, so we have to try to neg. gamma trade it.  

That is the 30 second version of the cluster I'm trying to close, hope it helps.

So, can we change the severance program as I've outlined?

As you guys go through working up a severance program, I started thinking about some equity issues.  If the average tenure of an employee at Enron is about 3 years, why not come up with 2 plans--1 for long serving employees who have been long dedicated to the company, and a second one for the more recently hired?  It doesnt' make sense to me that someone who has been here under a year at $100,000 base should be entitled to 11 weeks even before they sign the waiver.  I would also not change the program in whatever form you ultimately settle on for the longer serving employees, rather just scale back the program for the newer employees.

Jeff

JS & MM:

Here is a quick summary of some my thoughts with regard to fundamentals as we begin finalization objectives and goals for 2002. I would like to discuss these issues with both you next week.

EWS Fundamentals: The Time Has Come

Phyically We are Together but "Informationally" We are Not:
ECS will be great for increasing phyisical proximity, but what are we doing to increase the flow of information across desks, commodities and people.
The MSG Board is a first step in the right direction
But we need to finish the "last mile". Information is still not disseminated effectively. 

Better Information and Rationalization of Resources
It time to consider having one EWS fundamentals site. 
It is both silly and a waste of resources to have  multiple models for various commodities.
Information and efforts need to be shared across the company.
Having multiples sites also limits information flow to trading. Traders should not have to search across multiple sites to receive information.
Why are 3 different analysts doing the same job in three different groups. (Example: Power, Gas, Crude--all do their own API analysis- why have 3? keep the best one and make it stronger.

Publications and IT are Expensive
This year we have eliminated duplication within EGM with regard to publications. It is now time to move cost consolidation across EWS.
Some publications cost in excess of  $100K per year. All duplication needs to be eliminated.
It is very expensive to keep 3 IT teams developing 3 different fundy sites. In EGM alone, this year we have  spent $1.5MM on IT.
We need to stop the island mentality. Leveraging off one platform could easily save millions.

I look forward to discussing these issues and receiving your feedback.
Thanks
Jen

Jim,

I will make my self available for a meeting if it can really happen.  This is very difficult for me do pull off but I'll be there if he can meet.  I am very skeptical that he would have a meeting to tell us that our project is dead or let us vent our frustration of wasting several years and $15 million putting together this project.

I'll be traveling for the rest of the week, please leave me a voicemail with any updates.

Thanks,
m

Eric:

Clay Harris and I met with the Venezuelan Ambassador this afternoon and reiterated our interest in arranging a meeting for Enron with President Chavez, who will visit the UK during 21-24 October.  The ambassador responded initially that Chavez's schedule had been "set for months" and that changing the schedule would be difficult.  After further discussion, he said Chavez would certainly be interested in discussing the project, and that they might be able to make time on the schedule at about 1100 hours on Tuesday 23 Oct.  We provided a brief overview of the status of the project, and he asked that we provide as soon as possible names and bio information for whoever would meet with Chavez if this comes off.  He promised to get back to us as quick as he can.  Please let us know who will be available from Houston for a possible Tuesday morning meeting here.  Thanks.

Jim

An old hillbilly farmer had a wife who nagged him unmercifully.  From
morning 'til night (and sometimes later), she was always complaining about
something.  The only time he got any relief was when he was out plowing
with his old mule.  He plowed a lot.

One day, when he was out plowing, his wife brought him lunch in the field.
He drove the old mule into the shade, sat down on a stump, and began to eat
his lunch.  Immediately, however, his wife began haranguing him again.
Complain, nag, nag; it just went on and on.  All of a sudden, the
old mule lashed out with both hind legs and caught her smack in the back of
the head, killing her dead on the spot.

At the funeral several days later, the minister noticed something rather
odd.  When a woman mourner would approach the old farmer, he would listen
for a minute then nod his head in agreement; but when a man approached him,
he would listen for a minute then shake his head in disagreement.  This was
so consistent, the minister decided to ask the old farmer about it.

So after the funeral, the minister spoke to the old farmer, and asked him
why he nodded his head and agreed with the women but always shook his head
and disagreed with the men.

The old farmer said, "Well, the women would come up and say something about
what a wonderful person my wife was, so I'd nod my head in agreement."

"And what about the men?" the minister asked.

"They all wanted to know if my mule was for sale."

Rick,

As you know we have stopped our agricultural commodity businesses, and therefore do not need any VAR associated with these businesses.  If this VAR is allocated to EGM, I would like to reallocate it within the business unit.  If VAR is approved for specific businesses, EGM will give this VAR back to Corp.

As well, I would like to reclass all softs, grains, and meats on the DPR as "other" and remove those headings.

Thanks

Jeff

Guys,
Here is the draft of some of the ways of looking at the EGM businesses.  This is the starting template and it will become a living document that can be attached with your cash flow sheets and 2002 earnings summaries.  I would like your written comments and other views on these sheets/topics.  

Obviously this is very confidential.

Thanks,
M

Wow! It sounds as if you really have been busy. I expect postcards
from each of the exotic places that you visit! I think that we
probably have a greater chance of meeting in an airport than in
either Atlanta or Houston!
Congrats on your appointment and honour at the Museum of Fine Arts!
It sounds really exciting! You will really get to "hob nob" with the
artistic types..I am a little envious...
I am actually awaiting several people in my group to arrive as we
have a group project to do this weekend... remember thaose days of
group projects...it is a little different when you are 30+...people
have to feed their kids and take care of those domestic obligations!!!
I'll send you Dori's info in the next email..I have it at home.
Take care and definitely let me know if you will visit South Africa.
Try to go during our winter, as it will be summer there.

Louise,

Imbedded in these allocations are several functions for which EIM receives 100% dedicated resources (legal, HR, PR, etc.).  Every 100% dedicated resource should be presented in its own RC -- in that way it becomes "controllable" and measurable.  Today it is buried in an indirect allocation.  This approach will isolate the truly indirect allocations and allow us to better manage the amount and appropriateness of these expenses.  We plan to push this topic with respect to all allocations which hit EIM from Enron Americas, Enron Networks, or Enron Corp.  Kent Castleman (EIM CAO) is going to discuss this approach with Wes.

As you know the budget planning cycle is upon us.  Several of the support functions role up under Enron Americas and then are billed out to the other Business Units.  I would encourage all of you to look at the initial allocations below you receive from each of these Support Functions in order to verify that you are satisfied with the planned charges to your accounts.  

Wes's group can provide you with this information.   

I will be meeting with the Support Groups over the next week and should you wish me to raise any issues on your behalf please let me know or please contact the group leaders directly.

As you can see from the Enron Americas allocation, I am hoping to make substantial changes to our numbers which reflect a substantially large increase from last year.

Dear Jeff,

How are you doing? I hope everything is all right with you. I just came back from Wharton undergrad interview, it was good, we have very strong candidates, and hopefully we can have them as many as possible. It is a pity that you were not there. 

Will you have time to chat a couple of minutes? I need to figure out my career path at Enron and I really need your help. And I will really appreciate it!

Looking forward to speaking to you!

Dear friends,

As discussed in the last executive committee meeting, I am preparing a list
of individuals for Fred Schroeder to "interview" when they are here to work
with us in November.  I'd like to send them 10 to 15 possiblilities as they
can see a good number over the time they're here, and those they don't catch
now can be contacted for a later trip.  Fred suggested we look at this as a
"first wave" of some people who know us well; more interviews with those at
a greater distance will come later.

Please let me know your thoughts.

I agree with the concept as it adds a degree of clarity.  We are however moving towards a fixed fee approach with the service providers in the organisation as I found I was spending too much time validating the 'controllables' which I think under your scenario would be monitoring the RCs.  So essentially, we (EA) will be paying a fixed transaction fee to the Energy Operations and IT functions which will be embodied in a contract, I will know my costs and nothing can just be allocated to me.  

The method of arriving at a number will be using historical numbers versus a growth projection for the number of transactions, I believe this will work for new businesses too.
This method allows me to concentrate on Enron Americas whilst not incurring large allocated charges which I spend time investigating.

Buyer of Service		Enron North America LLC
Seller of Service		Enron Net Works LLC
Service				All support services for the operation of its daily business activities.
Price per transaction		0 - 5000 transactions/day 		x cents per transaction
				5000 - 10000 transactions/day		x cents per transaction
				>10000 transactions/day		x cents per transaction
Bonus premiums	/ penalties	Premiums and Penalties associated with specific performance criteria to be agreed (Eg Noms made in a timely fashion for 100 					consecutive days).

Imbedded in these allocations are several functions for which EIM receives 100% dedicated resources (legal, HR, PR, etc.).

Premiums Stay High on Enron's Near Options, And `Doubling Up' Date Looms fo=

NEW YORK -- Volatility and premiums on Enron's near-month options remain ex=
tremely high. It is a sign that investors are willing to pay a rich price f=
or option protection and expect the stock to be unsettled as the Houston co=
mpany sorts through its credit and debt problems and seeks to calm frazzled=
 investors.=20
Enron near-month defensive puts traded heavily in an otherwise quiet sessio=
n Wednesday, as investors bought them to hedge. The December 5 puts traded =
more than 10,000 contracts and jumped 45 cents to $1.10 at the Chicago Boar=
d Options Exchange. The stock closed down $1.98, or 28%, to $5.01, as of 4 =
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
Enron's calls traded actively as some investors sold them to generate incom=
e. Traders noted some call buying -- especially after Enron procured a thre=
e-week extension on a $690 million note -- as some hopeful investors bet on=
 Enron pulling through its troubles and proceeding with its merger with Dyn=
egy Inc. Enron's December 5 calls traded more than 14,500 contracts, compar=
ed with open interest of 710, as they fell $1.45 to $1.15 at the CBOE.=20
For investors who want to book a tax loss on beaten-down stocks, the "wash =
sale" rule can be a hurdle, because it essentially prevents taxpayers from =
selling stock or securities at a loss and then reacquiring "substantially i=
dentical" securities within a 30-day period before or after that loss. This=
 poses a problem for those who want to book a loss yet own stocks whose pri=
ces now make them attractive "buy" candidates.=20
In addition, the Internal Revenue Service has taken the position that the w=
ash-sale rule will disallow a loss if the investor sells an in-the-money pu=
t, because there is a strong likelihood that stock will be put to or acquir=
ed by the investor.=20
So investors typically get around the wash-sale rule by "doubling up": buyi=
ng additional stock or options, waiting at least 31 days, and then selling =
the original stock to book the loss. Investors double up by buying calls, w=
hich locks a price to buy stock and achieves the same effect as buying addi=
tional stock.

Dynegy Deal To Buy Enron Hits Crossroads
By Rebecca Smith and John R. Emshwiller
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

11/23/2001
The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Even as it reiterated its intention to purchase Enron Corp., Dynegy Inc. is=
 coming under increasing pressure to renegotiate or walk away from the mult=
ibillion-dollar deal.=20
The pressure is stemming from the continuing slide in the price of Enron sh=
ares and the mounting financial problems at the Houston energy-trading comp=
any, the nation's biggest marketer of electricity and natural gas. During t=
he past month, Enron has taken a $1 billion write-off of assets, revised do=
wnward the earnings of the past several years and taken a $1.2 billion redu=
ction in shareholder equity.
The problems have been due largely to dealings Enron had with private partn=
erships, run by some of its own executives, under investigation by the Secu=
rities and Exchange Commission. In an SEC filing Monday, Enron disclosed hu=
ndreds of millions of potential additional write-offs as well as the possib=
ility that its weakening financial condition could force it to repay more t=
han $2 billion in loans by the end of the year.=20
As of 4 p.m. Wednesday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron =
shares fell $1.98, or 28%, to $5.01 each after having dropped 23% Tuesday. =
In excess of 115 million shares traded Wednesday, more than four times the =
volume of any other Big Board stock. Enron's bonds also again traded sharpl=
y lower, market observers said.=20
The turmoil spilled over to Dynegy's stock, which also was among the most a=
ctively traded on the New York Stock Exchange. As of 4 p.m. Wednesday, Dyne=
gy shares fell $1.94 to $39.76 each.=20
On Wednesday, Dynegy issued a statement in which Chairman and Chief Executi=
ve Chuck Watson said his company was working "to accelerate the regulatory =
approvals required to complete the merger in accordance with the previously=
 announced agreement" though it continued to perform "due diligence" on Enr=
on.=20
Under the merger agreement, Dynegy has opportunities to renegotiate or walk=
 away from the deal if Enron's financial and legal problems become severe e=
nough. However, some observers said it can be difficult to invoke these so-=
called material adverse change clauses. They point to a decision earlier th=
is year by a Delaware Chancery Court judge who forced Tyson Foods Inc. to c=
omplete a planned purchase of IBP Inc. even though Tyson, a Springdale, Ark=
., food-products company, had wanted to cancel the transaction because of a=
 drop in IBP's earnings and accounting problems at an IBP unit.=20
Dynegy officials didn't return calls seeking comment. To complete the deal,=
 two-thirds of Dynegy shareholders and a majority of Enron shareholders wou=
ld have to give their approval. No dates for those votes have been set.=20
One person familiar with the merger plans said the SEC filing Monday by Enr=
on contained information Dynegy hadn't known about. Dynegy representatives =
planned to work through the weekend evaluating the importance of this new i=
nformation as part of the company's due diligence, this person said. It cou=
ldn't be determined what the new information was.=20
The merger agreement, announced Nov. 9, calls for Dynegy to exchange 0.2685=
 share for each of Enron's roughly 850 million fully diluted shares, giving=
 the purchase a value of about $9 billion at Dynegy's current stock price. =
However, from a price standpoint, the deal is appearing less attractive to =
Dynegy.=20
On the day of the merger announcement, Enron shares were trading at about $=
8.63 each, or about 83% of the purchase price under the exchange ratio. As =
of Wednesday, Enron's market price was only about 47% of the merger-formula=
 price. Such a sharp deterioration is unusual following a merger announceme=
nt, when the stock price of the company being acquired generally begins tra=
ding relatively close to the offering price.=20
Sentiment among Wall Street analysts also is turning against the merger. In=
itially, many analysts lauded the merger as a move that would rescue Enron =
and provide a major boost to Houston-based Dynegy. Dynegy and Enron officia=
ls have predicted that the merger, supposed to be completed late next year,=
 would significantly and immediately increase Dynegy's earnings.=20
Now analysts are challenging that assumption. Ron Barone, managing director=
 at UBS Warburg LLC, said he believes that because of Enron's financial pro=
blems, a combined company would actually have lower earnings next year than=
 Dynegy would have by itself. Mr. Barone said he thinks a "likely scenario"=
 is that the merger formula will be renegotiated sharply down to about 0.15=
 Dynegy share for each Enron share.=20
Such a ratcheting down wouldn't be without precedent in the deal. According=
 to one person familiar with the merger negotiations, Dynegy reduced the ex=
change formula at least once prior to the Nov. 9 announcement because of En=
ron's rapidly sinking stock price, which at the beginning of this year was =
above $80 a share.=20
In perhaps the most significant sign of the turning tide on Wall Street, Go=
ldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer lowered his ratings on Enron and Dynegy=
. A longtime Enron fan, Mr. Fleischer issued a report expressing doubts tha=
t the merger would help Dynegy's earnings and whether Enron could "recover =
the significant business that has been lost" in its giant energy-trading op=
erations. "The Enron machine continues to sputter," Mr. Fleischer wrote.=20
Some observers say that if Dynegy walked away from the deal or tried to ren=
egotiate the terms significantly, Enron might be pushed into a bankruptcy-l=
aw filing. Without the Dynegy acquisition and continued support from its ba=
nkers and customers, an Enron bankruptcy-court filing "is highly possible,"=
 said Ralph Pellecchia, a senior director at Fitch, a credit-ratings agency=
. On Wednesday, Fitch maintained its credit rating on Enron at just one not=
ch above noninvestment-grade, or "junk," status. But Fitch also said it bel=
ieved Enron's trading partners had made "significant cash collateral calls"=
 in recent days that are "well in excess of previous expectations," contrib=
uting to "liquidity pressures."=20
Among the advisers Enron has hired during its current crisis is the law fir=
m of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, which specializes in bankruptcy and corporate-=
workout situations. Asked about a possible bankruptcy filing, an Enron spok=
eswoman said the company expects the Dynegy deal to go through and therefor=
e doesn't expect to have to look at alternatives to the merger. Since the m=
erger announcement, Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay has said his company had alt=
ernatives to the Dynegy deal but he has declined to identify them. Enron sa=
id it made some progress improving its financial position. The company said=
 it reached a final agreement with units of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Cit=
igroup Inc. on the remaining $450 million of a previously announced $1 bill=
ion in secured credit lines. Enron said lenders had agreed to extend repaym=
ent of an existing $690 million note to mid-December from next week. The sp=
okeswoman said a restructuring of that obligation is expected to be complet=
ed next month so that repayment wouldn't be required this year.=20

Enron Faces Suits by 401(k) Plan Participants
By Theo Francis and Ellen Schultz
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

11/23/2001
The Wall Street Journal
C1
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Enron Corp., the embattled Houston energy and trading company, has been sue=
d by members of its employee-retirement plan, which has suffered losses bec=
ause of Enron's plummeting stock price.=20
Two separate lawsuits, filed in federal court in Houston, allege Enron misl=
ed participants in its 401(k) retirement plan about the risks of investing =
in the company's shares and note that the company forced the employees to r=
emain invested in its stock even as the shares fell. Amid growing disclosur=
es of financial problems in recent weeks, the company "locked down" the ret=
irement plan from Oct. 17 to Nov. 19 to make administrative changes, which =
prevented employees from selling Enron shares as the share price collapsed.
Enron, which recently agreed to be acquired by Dynegy Inc., Houston, becaus=
e of mounting financial problems, has seen its stock price fall to $5.01 on=
 Wednesday from a peak of nearly $90 a share last year. The decline has bee=
n costly to participants in Enron's retirement plan because more than 60% o=
f the 401(k) assets were invested in Enron shares at the end of last year, =
according to one of the suits.=20
The first suit was filed Nov. 13 on behalf of plan participants by Campbell=
 Harrison & Wright LLP, a Houston law firm, and the second was filed Tuesda=
y by Seattle-based Hagens Berman LLP. Both seek class-action certification.=
=20
Enron said its corporate policy is not to comment on pending lawsuits. A sp=
okeswoman also said the company's 401(k) plan offers participants 18 invest=
ment choices, one of which is company stock.=20
The company's stock has fallen amid mounting losses and disclosures that it=
 had extensive off-balance-sheet dealings with a web of partnerships headed=
 by former company officials. The Securities and Exchange Commission has la=
unched a formal investigation into the company's accounting, and Enron has =
said it will restate years of financial information.=20
The suits against Enron are the latest of a series of suits filed against c=
ompanies over losses in the company-stock portion of their 401(k) plans. Th=
e suits allege the plan trustees breached their fiduciary duties by continu=
ing to offer company stock, even after they became aware of serious busines=
s problems that would hurt the stock price. All the suits are pending.=20
As with most of these companies, Enron matches employee contributions to th=
e 401(k) with shares of Enron stock, and also offers Enron stock as an inve=
stment choice, in addition to a variety of mutual funds. About $1.3 billion=
 of the plan's $2.1 billion in assets was invested in Enron shares at the e=
nd of 2000, according to the suit filed by Campbell Harrison.=20
Pamela Tittle, a participant in the 401(k) plan who worked in the finance d=
epartment and a named plaintiff in the Enron suit filed by Campbell Harriso=
n & Wright, had roughly 2,000 shares of Enron stock in her retirement accou=
nt and has suffered losses of about $140,000 as a result of the stock's dec=
line. The suit alleges that the trustees of the Enron 401(k) plan violated =
their fiduciary duties by not informing plan participants that the company =
stock was in peril.=20
The suit filed by Hagens Berman, also alleges that the company failed to wa=
rn participants about risks of remaining invested in Enron stock. In additi=
on, it accuses Enron of systematically misrepresenting its financial result=
s since 1998 in connection with the partnerships under investigation by the=
 SEC.=20
Roy E. Rinard, a lineman for Enron in Oregon who is a named plaintiff in th=
e suit filed by Hagens Berman, has seen the value of his retirement plan fa=
ll to $70,000 from $470,000, largely as a result of the decline in Enron's =
stock. "I feel like I have been betrayed," Mr. Rinard said in press release=
 issued by his lawyers. "I lost my savings, my plans for the future, everyt=
hing."=20
Under federal pension law, companies are allowed to offer their own stock i=
n retirement plans, and are allowed to force employees to hold onto the sto=
ck. Enron doesn't let employees diversify out of shares they receive as mat=
ching contributions to the 401(k) plan until age 50.=20
However, plan trustees are supposed to operate the plan in the best interes=
ts of the participants, which includes choosing prudent investments. Genera=
lly, to prove that the plan's administrators breached their fiduciary dutie=
s, employees must show that the trustees knew the stock was a bad investmen=
t. This presents a high hurdle, so it is not surprising that prior lawsuits=
 over losses in company stock in 401(k) plans have generally come in the wa=
ke of allegations of accounting irregularities.=20
Lynn Sarko, one of Ms. Tittle's attorneys with Seattle's Keller Rohrback LL=
P, is also co-lead counsel in a similar lawsuit against Lucent Technologies=
 Inc., Murray Hill, N.J. Another firm representing Ms. Tittle is Dalton Got=
to Samson & Kilgard PLC, which is lead counsel in a similar suit against Ik=
on Office Solutions Inc., Malvern, Pa. The two law firms are representing M=
s. Tittle with Campbell Harrison & Wright.=20
The suits against Lucent and Ikon, like the suit against Enron, allege that=
 then-current plan trustees kept offering company stock in the plan despite=
 knowing of serious business problems that would hurt the stock price. Repr=
esentatives for Ikon and Lucent say their companies didn't require employee=
s to invest in the company stock, and educated employees about the need for=
 diversification.=20
The suit in which Mr. Rinard is plaintiff notes that on Oct. 17, a day afte=
r Enron announced the company was taking a nonrecurring charge totaling $1.=
01 billion in the third quarter, Enron "locked down" the 401(k) plan's asse=
ts, preventing participants from selling Enron shares. (A "lock-down" occur=
s when a retirement plan is transferred from one administrator to another, =
and generally lasts several weeks, during which time participants can't mak=
e changes in their investment choices).=20
The lock-down was lifted on Nov. 19. In the interim, on Nov. 8, Enron annou=
nced it would be forced to restate downward its reported financial results =
from 1997 through 2000. By the time the lock-down was lifted, as a result o=
f all the negative news the shares had fallen to below $9 a share from $32.=
20 on Oct. 17, when the lockup started, Hagens Berman attorney Karl Barth s=
aid.=20
"They were locked into it right when Enron knew it was going to be announci=
ng some really bad news," Mr. Barth said. "Mr. Rinard's looking at having n=
o retirement savings now. It's a horrible thing to have to start over in yo=
ur 50s."

>From Sunbeam to Enron, Andersen's Reputation Suffers
By FLOYD NORRIS

11/23/2001
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company

THIS has been the worst year ever for Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm =
that once deserved the title of conscience of the industry. The Securities =
and Exchange Commission filed civil fraud complaints against the Andersen p=
artner who audited Sunbeam and against the firm itself in the Waste Managem=
ent case.=20
Now Enron has repudiated the financial statements that were certified by Ar=
thur Andersen, in the process shaving more than half a billion dollars from=
 the company's reported profits in recent years.
All of which raises the question: Has Arthur Andersen become the black shee=
p of the accounting industry?=20
It is not an easy question to answer, and not everyone is willing to rush t=
o judgment. ''If you want to attack Andersen for Enron, you need to know mo=
re than we know,'' Arthur Levitt, the former chairman of the Securities and=
 Exchange Commission, said this week.=20
But if there is a thread connecting what is known about the three cases, it=
 is materiality. In all three cases, Andersen auditors spotted bad accounti=
ng but were persuaded it was immaterial and therefore allowed it to go ahea=
d.=20
Materiality is one of those flexible concepts that can get accountants into=
 trouble. The idea is that it doesn't much matter if a few little things we=
re gotten wrong. But they can add up.=20
At Enron, however, they did not add up to that much -- a total of $93 milli=
on over four years. The biggest restatement of Enron profits concerns a rel=
ated party that Enron now says should have been consolidated. It is not cle=
ar if Andersen had the facts needed to make that decision at the time.=20
To those who treasure the role of auditors, the humiliation of Andersen is =
painful. Back in the 1950's, it was Leonard Spacek, Andersen's managing par=
tner, who warned that ''the profession's existence is in peril'' because it=
 was not showing enough independence. His public prodding was crucial in ma=
king the industry do a better job. Two decades ago, when the issue on the t=
able was pension accounting, Andersen was the only major accounting firm to=
 break with clients and push for good rules.=20
Now Andersen's backbone is open to question. It was evidence that senior pe=
ople at Andersen repeatedly gave in to pressure from Waste Management that =
led the S.E.C. to bring that suit, which the firm chose to settle without a=
dmitting it had done anything wrong. The partner that the S.E.C. says looke=
d the other way at Sunbeam is fighting the accusations, and Andersen says h=
e acted properly.=20
Lynn Turner, who was chief accountant of the S.E.C. at the time and is now =
director of the Center for Quality Financial Reporting at Colorado State Un=
iversity, says what is happening to Andersen now is reminiscent of what hap=
pened to Coopers & Lybrand when he was a partner there and the firm had a s=
eries of highly publicized blown audits.=20
''We got bludgeoned to death in the press,'' he said. ''People did not even=
 want to see us at their doorsteps. It was brutal, but we deserved it. We h=
ad gotten into this mentality in the firm of making business judgment calls=
.'' By that he meant that the firm paid too much attention to not offending=
 clients and not enough to good accounting.=20
For Andersen to avoid that fate, its relatively new chief executive, Joseph=
 Berardino, who declined to be interviewed for this column, will need to se=
t a tone inside the firm making clear that he expects auditors to show the =
backbone that Mr. Spacek epitomized. And then he will have to convince the =
public of that.

Chase and J. P. Morgan's Paper Anniversary
A Year After the Merger, Rosy Plans Meet Reality
By RIVA D. ATLAS

11/23/2001
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 5
c. 2001 New York Times Company

When William B. Harrison Jr. speaks of last year's $31 billion merger of J.=
 P. Morgan and the Chase Manhattan Corporation, he speaks proudly of a deal=
 that he considers to be a capstone to his 34-year career of helping build =
a giant of the banking business.=20
''This is the first merger I've been part of,'' said Mr. Harrison, the chie=
f executive of the combined bank, ''where I feel our core business is compl=
ete.''
The Chase-J. P. Morgan combination helped advance the bank into the investm=
ent banking elite, just as Mr. Harrison intended. But with Wall Street and =
the economy in far different places today than they were when the deal was =
put together, the many mergers, stock sales and other money-making opportun=
ities that were supposed to justify the high-priced acquisition have largel=
y dried up for now.=20
Consequently, deal makers and analysts who follow the bank are already spec=
ulating that Mr. Harrison, 58, may ultimately be compelled to do yet anothe=
r large deal, this time to diversify his business away from its heavy empha=
sis on Wall Street.=20
J. P. Morgan Chase has won some prominent assignments, like handling the re=
vampings of troubled giants like Lucent and, more recently, Enron, the bele=
aguered energy trading company.=20
But while J. P. Morgan Chase is proud of serving alongside Citigroup as bot=
h lead lender and adviser to Enron on its acquisition by Dynegy, the dual r=
ole it has worked to achieve sometimes proves complicated for the bank. Wit=
h Enron's shares in free fall as more information comes out about its hidde=
n debts, J. P. Morgan Chase has been scrambling to maintain the support of =
other banks while simultaneously keeping the merger with Dynegy on track.=
=20
Thanks largely to the slump on Wall Street, J. P. Morgan Chase's profits fe=
ll by two-thirds in the third quarter, to $449 million from $1.4 billion in=
 the period a year ago. Its stock has dropped 15 percent this year, more th=
an other banks' shares. The bank's stock is ahead of investment banks like =
Goldman Sachs, with which J. P. Morgan Chase increasingly competes.=20
''The jury is still out in many respects on this merger,'' said Judah Kraus=
haar, an analyst at Merrill Lynch. Nevertheless, he likes J. P. Morgan Chas=
e's stock, he said, because ''expectations are very low.''=20
All J. P. Morgan Chase's competitors are suffering from the slowdown on Wal=
l Street. But some, like Citigroup, are better diversified and have greater=
 involvement in old-fashioned consumer banking, which is proving to be a st=
rong moneymaker this year.=20
Nearly a third of J. P. Morgan Chase's revenues are consumer-oriented. By c=
ontrast, its chief New York rival, Citigroup, gets half its revenues from c=
onsumer businesses.=20
''The timing of the merger was bad,'' said Steven Wharton, a banking analys=
t at Loomis, Sayles & Company, which owns about a million J. P. Morgan Chas=
e shares. ''There's no disputing that.''=20
Actually, Mr. Harrison disputes it. ''I can't tell you how happy I am about=
 having done this merger,'' he said in a recent interview. ''While there ar=
e pluses and minuses to operating in a weak economic environment, we have a=
 much stronger platform to manage with during this difficult time.''=20
In Mr. Harrison's favor is his battle-tested team of top executives who hav=
e worked together for a decade or more. Few executives remain in the top sp=
ots from the old J. P. Morgan. Instead, most major posts are filled by mana=
gers who have worked with Mr. Harrison since his days at Chemical Bank, whe=
re he spent most of his career. Mr. Harrison's team successfully gobbled up=
 Manufacturers Hanover Bank in 1991, then followed that with Chemical's mer=
ger with Chase Manhattan in 1996 before incorporating Morgan into the fold =
last year.=20
The group of Chemical veterans includes Marc J. Shapiro, who oversees finan=
ce and risk management at J. P. Morgan Chase; Donald H. Layton, one of two =
leaders of investment banking; and James B. Lee Jr., the bank's senior deal=
 maker. The team also includes Dina Dublon, the bank's chief financial offi=
cer.=20
Two other senior executives have also lived through big deals. Geoffrey T. =
Boisi, the other investment banking leader, was the one-time investment ban=
king chief at Goldman, Sachs. David A. Coulter, in charge of Chase's retail=
 bank, had been chief executive of Bank of America before it was bought by =
NationsBank.=20
''There aren't many teams that have gone through as many mergers as Bill Ha=
rrison and his team,'' said Mark G. Solow, managing principal at GarMark Ad=
visors, an investment firm, and a former senior executive at Chemical.=20
Still, Ms. Dublon acknowledged that the tough economy was making the J. P. =
Morgan takeover more difficult than the earlier combinations.=20
''In general, mergers are very hard on morale,'' she said. ''There is no qu=
estion that this one has a tougher emotional toll.''=20
The bank's executives are making the best of a bad situation. They have tak=
en advantage of the slowdown to cut around 8 percent of the combined banks'=
 staff, or about 2,500 more employees than anticipated at the time the merg=
er was announced.=20
Many of these job cuts were aimed at high-cost investment bankers: J. P. Mo=
rgan Chase expects that 6,000 jobs in its investment banking division will =
have been eliminated by the end of the year.=20
''We have focused on the tougher jobs to cut,'' Ms. Dublon said.=20
In some ways the overall market turmoil has made it easier for J. P. Morgan=
 Chase to overhaul its staff. With fewer jobs available on Wall Street, Mr.=
 Shapiro said, the employees who are left behind are less apt to complain a=
bout changes in their jobs. ''People have fewer options,'' he said, ''so yo=
u have a little more control over the process.''=20
Thanks partly to these cuts, the bank estimates the saving from cost cuttin=
g will be $3.6 billion annually, compared with an original projection of $2=
 billion at the time of the merger.=20
The cost cutting has helped compensate somewhat for a sharp drop in profits=
 in the bank's core businesses. ''What we can control and are managing very=
 aggressively is the expenses of the company,'' Ms. Dublon said in a confer=
ence call with reporters on Oct. 17, the day earnings were announced.=20
Aside from cost cuts, the weakness on Wall Street makes it hard for the ban=
k's executives to point to tangible gains in investment banking, where fees=
 were down 24 percent in the third quarter. But Mr. Harrison points to mark=
et-share gains the bank has achieved at the expense of competitors on Wall =
Street. He hopes that when the investment banking business revives, J. P. M=
organ Chase will hold on to these gains.=20
The bank is particularly proud of its standing in two areas: mergers and ac=
quisitions, and the underwriting of large investment-grade bond deals.=20
The bank ranked 5th worldwide in the highly profitable category of advising=
 on mergers during the first nine months of 2001, up from Chase's 12th-plac=
e finish and J. P. Morgan's 10th-place standing during the same period last=
 year, according to Thomson Financial Securities data.=20
The merger and acquisitions business, which Chase had been slowly building =
for years, is stronger following the merger with J. P. Morgan, said Mr. Lee=
, a vice chairman at the bank. As a result, the bank is able to win assignm=
ents providing advice to customers who dealt with the old Chase only for lo=
ans.=20
Mr. Lee remains proud of the bank's work with Enron, the energy company, de=
spite its troubles. J. P. Morgan Chase, along with Citigroup, raised $1 bil=
lion in bank financing for Enron earlier this month. It was also hired to a=
dvise the company, which hopes to be saved from collapse by being taken ove=
r by Dynegy.=20
The old Chase, long a lending powerhouse, would have had a good shot at lea=
ding the bank financing, but an advisory role would have been less certain.=
 Mr. Lee said the investment banker advising Enron came from the old J. P. =
Morgan. But with merger activity slow, there are few such deals to go aroun=
d.=20
The bank is also proud of its strength in long-term investment-grade bonds,=
 another area that business executives say has been enhanced by the merger.=
 It moved up to second place in that area so far this year, compared with s=
ixth place a year ago.=20
The bank has taken advantage of a boom in large corporate bond offerings, a=
 surge driven by today's low interest rates. In May J. P. Morgan Chase rais=
ed $12 billion in bonds for WorldCom, the telecommunications company, in th=
e largest corporate debt deal in the United States on record.=20
Unfortunately for J. P. Morgan Chase, the fees for underwriting investment-=
grade debt are small compared with the money to be earned coordinating offe=
rings of stock, where J. P. Morgan Chase remains a second-tier competitor.=
=20
The bank actually lost market share in the rankings for underwriters of sto=
ck, falling to 9th place this year, compared with the old J. P. Morgan's 6t=
h-place finish a year ago. (Chase was 11th.)=20
Mr. Harrison said the bank was taking advantage of the slowdown in stock of=
ferings to build momentum slowly in that business. ''We think we have a cha=
nce in the second half of this year to be in the top five,'' he said.=20
Given the slowdown, some bankers predict that Mr. Harrison will ultimately =
do another deal, either to expand his consumer banking business or to bolst=
er weak areas in investment banking, like the equity division.=20
''The general view is that the combination with J. P. Morgan didn't do enou=
gh,'' one investment banker said.=20
Mr. Harrison disagrees: ''I don't feel,'' he said, ''we need to do another =
large deal to be successful.''

COMPANIES & FINANCE THE AMERICAS - Enron 'awaiting' capital injections, say=
 officials.

Officials working to shore up Enron's balance sheet yesterday said the stru=
ggling energy trader hoped to receive capital injections of more than $1.5b=
n as early as next week.=20
Enron is in talks about $250m investments with JP Morgan Chase and Citigrou=
p and is also hoping to raise at least $1bn from private equity investors.
People close to Enron declined to comment on which buyout firms might wish =
to invest in Enron. However, the Blackstone Group, which was reported to be=
 talking to the company before Dynegy made its $9bn rescue bid, is understo=
od no longer to be doing so.=20
Members of the 20-strong bank lending group, led by JP Morgan Chase and Cit=
igroup, are being asked to defer the maturities of their upcoming debt unti=
l after the completion of the merger.=20
The moves comes as reports from Goldman Sachs and Fitch, the credit rating =
agency, raised questions about the company's cash flow and its medium-term =
viability.=20
David Fleischer, a Goldman Sachs analyst, argued that cash balances were in=
adequate to meet $2.8bn of debt obligations falling due before the end of t=
he year.=20
People close to Enron say that nearly $1bn of that debt has already been re=
structured.=20
The Fitch report said that if the Dynegy deal was not completed, Enron woul=
d struggle to meet $9bn of obligations due before the end of next year.=20
People close to Enron insisted that Dynegy remained committed to the merger=
 and played down talk of renegotiation.=20
Dynegy would shortly issue a statement reasserting its commitment to the de=

USA: UPDATE 2-Enron bleeds again as Dynegy deal doubts grow.

By C. Bryson Hull
HOUSTON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - A long weekend of work faced Dynegy Inc. and pr=
oposed acquisition Enron Corp.,, whose worsening stock woes on Friday whipp=
ed up fear that the deal could be renegotiated or collapse entirely.=20
Houston-based Dynegy and its advisers were expected to spend the long holid=
ay weekend reviewing larger cross-town rival Enron's complex books, as both=
 parties race against the decline in Enron's stock to complete the thorough=
 financial examinations a merger requires.=20
Enron shares ended down more than 5 percent, or 27 cents, to $4.74 at the c=
lose of abbreviated Friday trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Dynegy s=
hares closed up 64 cents, or 1.61 percent, to $40.40.=20
Dynegy on Nov. 9 agreed to pay about $9 billion in stock for Enron. But, af=
ter falling 45 percent by Friday's close amid fears it could run out of cas=
h before the deal closes, Enron's market capitalization is only about $4.03=
 billion.=20
At Dynegy's current stock price, its offer for Enron is worth about $10.85 =
a share - more than twice Enron's current share price.=20
Executives and advisers from both companies are in the final stages of the =
review, known as due diligence, sources familiar with the matter told Reute=
rs. The sources said renegotiations had not been discussed as of Friday aft=
ernoon, and that such discussions could not occur until the due diligence r=
eview is finished.=20
But should it turn up any more unpleasant surprises that qualify as a "mate=
rial adverse change" in Enron's business, the likelihood increases of Dyneg=
y invoking escape clauses or renegotiating, analysts and observers say.=20
"You've got to believe there is that possibility. There is a 90 percent spr=
ead on the deal," said one analyst. "There's unquestionably continued malai=
se in Enron's core business and Dynegy has left itself open to renegotiate =
with Enron."=20
UBS Warburg analyst Ron Barone on Wednesday wrote in a research report that=
 the likelihood was "soaring" that Dynegy might discover a material adverse=
 change.=20
Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said that, to her knowledge, Dynegy was not r=
enegotiating the terms of the acquisition.=20
She repeated that Enron was working on obtaining an additional $500 million=
 to $1 billion in private equity funding to help shore up the balance sheet=
.=20
Dynegy spokesman John Sousa said due diligence was continuing and said the =
company remains optimistic about the merger.=20
TRADERS FEARING RENEGOTIATION=20
Enron's recent admission that lower volumes at its trading business - the c=
rown jewel of Enron that Dynegy most covets - could cause low fourth-quarte=
r earnings raises the possibility that the trading business is losing its p=
rofitability. Continued losses there would remove a key attraction for Dyne=
gy.=20
Electricity traders said the latest developments are making it seem more li=
kely that Dynegy will renegotiate the deal or back out entirely, a move the=
y said would leave Enron vulnerable to creditors and a possible bankruptcy.=
=20
This week rating agency Fitch Investors said that if Dynegy stepped away fr=
om the merger, Enron's credit situation seemed untenable and a bankruptcy f=
iling was highly possible.=20
Traders, speaking on condition on anonymity, said they expected Dynegy to s=
cramble over the weekend to narrow the growing share price gap. Enron's dep=
leted market value and the shrinking volume in its EnronOnline trading syst=
em makes it more likely Dynegy could pull out, traders said.=20
Meanwhile, energy traders reiterated that they would shy away from long-ter=
m deals with Enron unless they received substantial assurances the company'=
s credit rating would soon improve.=20
Enron's bonds on Friday were again talked at junk-bond levels, but even low=
er than before.=20
Enron's 6.4 percent notes maturing in 2006 and its 6.75 percent notes were =
bid Friday at 57 cents on the dollar, down from a respective 62 and 60 cent=
s on Wednesday, according to a trader. The notes yield to maturity a respec=
tive 21.5 percent and 17 percent. Its 20-year zero-coupon convertible bonds=
 fell about 1 cent on the dollar to just over 33 cents.=20
Enron is hovering at the edge of investment-grade as the three main credit =
trading agencies consider whether to cut them again, and some observers won=
der how Enron has avoided it.=20
"A bond trading in the 50s has nothing to do with an investment-grade secur=

USA: Enron avoids junk status, but observers wonder how.
By Jonathan Stempel

11/23/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Nov 23 (Reuters) - It is rare that holding onto investment-grade =
credit ratings means as much to a company as it does now to beleaguered ene=
rgy trader Enron Corp. , and some observers are wondering why a cut to junk=
 status is taking so long.=20
"The sum of all knowledge is in the valuation of the stock and the bonds," =
said Scott Smith, a principal at Wells Capital Management in San Francisco,=
 where he invests $6 billion in debt, and does not own Enron. "A bond tradi=
ng in the 50s has nothing to do with an investment-grade security."
Enron's 6.4 percent notes maturing in 2006 and 6.75 percent notes were bid =
Friday at 57 cents on the dollar, down from a respective 62 and 60 cents on=
 Wednesday, a trader said. The notes yield to maturity 21.5 percent and 17 =
percent.=20
Meanwhile, Enron's shares have sunk 94 percent this year. Since October 16,=
 when it released third-quarter results, which it has since revised downwar=
d, its shares have fallen 86 percent, and its bonds by nearly half.=20
Houston-based Enron, which is trying to merge with smaller cross-town rival=
 Dynegy Inc. , has been rocked this year by accounting problems, earnings r=
estatements, a federal investigation and a top management shuffle.=20
Its advisers were expected this weekend to pore over the company's books, w=
hich could lead to a renegotiation of the merger, sources familiar with the=
 matter said.=20
Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's have cut its senior unsecur=
ed debt ratings twice in the last month to their current "Baa3" and "BBB-mi=
nus," their lowest investment grades. Fitch has cut its equivalent rating t=
o "BBB-minus," and all three agencies have warned of more possible cuts.=20
The stakes could hardly be higher.=20
CASH CRUNCH=20
A downgrade to "junk" status could imperil Enron's trading business, force =
it to pay off as much as $3.9 billion of debt issued mostly by two trusts, =
and possibly force it to seek bankruptcy protection, analysts said.=20
Enron said in a securities filing it recently had less than $2 billion of a=
vailable cash and credit lines.=20
S&P said on Tuesday that Enron faces "liquidity issues," but enjoys an "ali=
gnment of interests" with its banks and a near-term financial position that=
 "is expected to be sufficient" to allow the Dynegy merger.=20
Fitch, meanwhile, said on Wednesday that "our present 'BBB-minus' rating re=
sts on the merger possibility and continued support of the lending banks."=
=20
If Dynegy walks away, it said, "Enron's credit situation seems untenable wi=
th a bankruptcy filing highly possible."=20
Enron said on Monday it had $9.15 billion of obligations due through next y=
ear, and a $690 million note that could come due next Tuesday. It later sai=
d it got a three-week reprieve.=20
INVESTMENT BANKS=20
Sean Egan, managing director of Egan-Jones Ratings Co. in Philadelphia, lik=
ened Enron's ratings situation to those of California's two largest utiliti=
es, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison .=20
Despite investor unease, those utilities kept their investment-grade rating=
s only until they defaulted on debt in January, as California's power crisi=
s worsened.=20
On November 8, a day before the Dynegy merger was announced, senior officia=
ls from Enron's lead banks - William Harrison, chief executive of J.P. Morg=
an Chase & Co. , and Michael Carpenter, who runs Citigroup Inc.'s investmen=
t banking arm - met with Moody's to help allay that agency's concerns, a pe=
rson familiar with the meeting said.=20
A day later, Moody's, which issued no statement on Enron this week, downgra=
ded the company's senior unsecured debt rating, but only to its current "Ba=
a3."=20
"Pressure is coming from the investment banks, which have a vested interest=
 in seeing the Dynegy deal go through," said Egan, whose agency rates Enron=
's debt "BB," its second-highest junk grade. "Investment banking fees will =
be substantial."=20
Companies pay for Moody's and S&P ratings, which they need to obtain financ=
ing. Egan said his agency receives no such payments.=20
Citigroup and J.P. Morgan declined to comment. Moody's and S&P did not imme=
diately return phone calls. Fitch was not immediately available for comment=
. Dynegy and Enron on Wednesday, however, reaffirmed their commitment to th=
e merger.=20
Wells Capital's Smith isn't sure what to expect.=20
"Enron will remain definitively investment grade if the merger as billed go=

said. "Obviously, the equity markets are telling you it's very skeptical th=

USA: Enron shares seesaw on concerns over Dynegy deal.

11/23/2001

(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Shares of Enron Corp. fluctuated wildly on Fri=
day morning, as concerns grew over rival Dynegy Inc.'s $9 billion acquisiti=
on of the beleaguered energy trader.=20
Enron shares were down 8 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $4.93 in Friday morning =
trading on the New York Stock Exchange, after diving more than 8 percent ea=
rlier.
The shares are down because of talk that the terms of Dynegy's deal with En=

Dynegy originally agreed to pay about $9 billion in stock for Enron. But, a=
fter falling 42 percent since then by Wednesday's close, Enron now sports a=
 market capitalization of only about $4.26 billion.=20
In a report on Wednesday, Ronald Barone, an analyst at UBS Warburg, suggest=

TALES OF THE TAPE: Energy Traders' Perfect Storm Stalls
By Christina Cheddar
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/23/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Here's one 2001 outlook that couldn't have been more=
 wrong.=20
Around this time last year, pundits and fund managers were touting "the per=
fect storm" of market forces that were coming together to make the energy t=
rading business one to watch in 2001.
Then came the California power crisis, and allegations of price-gouging and=
 fears of credit defaults began to cloud the outlook for the group. That wa=
s followed by renewed volatility in power prices, and this time the prices =
were headed down, not up.=20
And then came a crushing blow against trading firms - the unraveling of the=
 industry's largest player, Enron Corp. (ENE).=20
Simply put, the perfect storm stalled, and a business once buoyed by high g=
as prices, strong demand and tight supply now lies in tatters.=20
The stocks of companies whom some say should be valued more like growth sto=
cks than utilities are instead mired at around nine-times earnings - about =
where traditional utilities trade.=20
And the chance for recovery in 2002?=20
Basu Mullick, portfolio manager of the Neuberger Berman Partners fund, is w=
illing to bet there is. He thinks energy traders deserve at least the same =
price-to-earnings multiple as the broader market's median, which is current=
ly between 16- to 17-times future earnings, he said. It's just a matter of =
time before the stocks get there.=20
"They were just recovering from Gray Davis," Mullick said, referring to the=
 governor of California, who had accused "out-of-state" energy traders of a=
rtificially inflating the price of power in the state, and triggering the s=
tate's energy crisis. "Now, they are recovering from Enron."=20
The fund manager also blames lower commodity prices, warm weather and poor =
demand for the recent weak performance in the group.=20
"Energy convergence companies are putting up terrific growth rates," he sai=
d. "I don't think they should get the same valuation as a garden-variety ut=
ility."=20
Still, others think the stock market is continuing to make distinctions bet=
ween the energy traders by taking a harder look at the companies' strategie=
s and financial disclosures.=20
Enron's precarious financial situation underscores the importance of accoun=
ting issues. Although many of Enron's financial problems aren't solely the =
fault of mark-to-market accounting issues, there has been growing attention=
 paid to this form of financial reporting because of the earnings volatilit=
y it can create.=20
Answers Elude Investors=20

Investors are asking hard questions, and not always getting the answers the=
y want.=20
Using mark-to-market methods, a company calculates the fair market value of=
 a commodity position - whether it's a contract, an option, a swap, etc. - =
at the time, even if the value of the position is realized over a longer pe=
riod. The problem with this method is the actual cash a company realizes fr=
om the position might not be the same value the company calculated in its o=
riginal assessment. Also, sometimes it isn't easy to calculate the fair val=
ue of the commodity position. This is particularly true in instances where =
the market for the commodity isn't liquid.=20
Over time, companies with the highest level of disclosure regarding their m=
ark-to-market gains will most likely trade at higher multiples to counterpa=
rts that provide little or no disclosure, said ABN AMRO Inc. analyst Paul P=
atterson.=20
Encouragingly, it appears companies may already be responding to the call f=
or added disclosure. According to a survey Patterson conducted, more compan=
ies with energy trading units were willing to disclose the details of their=
 mark-to-market accounting practices during third-quarter conference calls =
compared with those in the second quarter.=20
Patterson said he prefers earnings that are cash-based.=20
"All things being equal, we believe reported earnings that more closely ref=
lect the timely realization of cash have a higher quality associated with t=
hem than earnings that do not," he said.=20
He expects investors to become smarter and learn to distinguish between ear=
nings growth through accrual accounting and growth fueled by mark-to-market=
 accounting.=20
At the end of the day, it is not a matter of simply producing profits, but =
being able to say where those earnings came from, said one investor, who ma=
nages a pension fund.=20
Some investors also may be placing a greater emphasis on the cash flow the =
energy merchants produce.=20
Tim O'Brien, portfolio manager of the Gabelli Utilities Fund, said energy m=
erchants that own the physical power assets to back up their trading positi=
ons should trade at a premium to an independent power producers and traditi=
onal utility companies. Still, the stocks should be valued at less than the=
 growth rate of the company because of their heavy exposures to commodity p=
rices.=20
Energy merchants include companies such as Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Duke Energy C=
orp. (DUK) and Dominion Resources Inc. (D).=20
According to O'Brien, the group never deserved to have the price-to-earning=
s multiples above 20- to 30-times earnings, which were once paid for the st=
ocks.=20
"We all got sucked up by the up-leg of the cycle and forgot just how cyclic=
al these companies are," O'Brien said, adding that the average multiple sho=

U.S. Energy Exhange May Scrap Online Platform Plans
By Stephen Parker
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/23/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The world's largest energy futures exchange is takin=
g a second look at plans to launch a major new electronic trading platform =
known as eNymex, and may decide to scrap them.=20
Management changes at the New York Mercantile Exchange, along with the succ=
ess of Access, an online platform the exchange expanded in September, have =
prompted the move.
Nymex may decide to combine parts of eNymex with Access, according to sourc=
es close to the matter. It is also exploring the idea of alliances with oth=
er exchanges, and considering developing "e-mini" contracts - smaller energ=
y contracts for Internet-based trade by retail investors.=20
"There's new management in place at the exchange," said Nymex spokeswoman N=
achamah Jacobovits. "They're rethinking all of our business strategies, and=
 one very massive strategy was the idea of this major eNymex B2B (business-=
to-business) system launch with a whole new slate of products."=20
Nymex and GlobalView Software Inc., a company that initially worked on buil=
ding the eNymex trading system, have sued each other in a dispute over work=
 on the project.=20
Kiodex, an electronic-trading technology firm that has developed the back e=
nd of the eNymex system, took on added development work for the project aft=
er GlobalView departed. The trade engine Kiodex was asked to build is "subs=
tantially complete, but the company can't speak to Nymex's overall electron=
ic-trading strategy," a Kiodex source said.=20
The eNymex platform was conceived as a forum for trading over-the-counter e=
nergy products, but Nymex has already moved ahead with plans for trading so=
me of them on Access, initially an overnight trading system that was expand=
ed in September. It hopes, for example, to launch gas swaps based on delive=
ry at the Henry Hub within the next six weeks on Access, Jacobovits said.=
=20
"We've expedited plans for a Henry Hub natural gas swap contract," Jacobovi=
ts said. "Traders could be looking for OTC clearing on a neutral-based plat=
form, which is a factor in that decision."=20
Before Sept. 14, Access was used only to trade energy futures at night, aft=
er the day's Nymex session had ended. Use was limited to Nymex members with=
 dedicated phone systems.=20
The exchange had been planning to expand use of Access, but ended up doing =
so sooner than it had expected. On Sept. 14, it started offering Access tra=
ding over the Internet, a move that will eventually allow Nymex to open up =
trade to more users.=20
The move was intended to help keep futures markets liquid after the Sept. 1=
1 attack on the World Trade Center. Nymex's building, located near where th=
e trade towers stood, was shut down for several days after the attacks. Exp=
anding its already existent Access system to the Internet helped ease poten=
tial liquidity problems that could have arisen from shortened floor trading=
 hours after Nymex reopened.=20
Development of the eNymex system began last year under the direction of for=
mer Nymex Chairman Daniel Rappaport. In August, Nymex said it would launch =
the eNymex platform within four to eight months. New Nymex President J. Rob=
ert "Bo" Collins Jr. said then that vendor problems had slowed development =
of the system's front-end technology and caused the delays. But he still ex=
pected eNymex to launch without any meaningful changes to its original prod=
uct line.=20
If Nymex combines parts or all of the platform originally intended as eNyme=
x with Access, the new system may end up being known as eNymex.=20
"eNymex right now is looking for a new mission," said an industry source cl=
ose to Nymex. "You know how politics works. We don't scrap it, we just rena=
me it. Anything we do electronically is now going to be called eNymex. But =
the original deal and concept that Rappaport initiated is done."=20
Nymex's reconsideration comes as the energy-trading world undergoes rapid c=
hange. The two most successful online energy trading platforms -- Enron Cor=
p.'s (ENE) EnronOnline, and IntercontinentalExchange, or ICE -- have seen t=
heir luck turn - in opposite directions.=20
Enron Corp. (ENE), which accounts for about 25% of the trade in U.S. power =
and gas markets, faces questions about its creditworthiness as the Securiti=
es and Exchange Commission investigates complicated financial dealings. Enr=
on's possible merger with Dynegy Inc. (DYN), now appears to be in doubt, an=
d energy trading companies are pulling back their exposure to the company.=
=20
Enron executes about 60% of its power and gas trades on EnronOnline. When E=
nron's troubles surfaced last month, Nymex quickly moved to extend its clea=
ring services to over-the-counter natural gas derivatives, a move the tradi=
ng community saw as an attempt to grab market share.=20
ICE, on the other hand, is moving ahead with plans to capture more energy t=
rade on its electronic format. ICE closed a deal this summer to acquire the=
 London-based International Petroleum Exchange - Nymex's chief competitor a=
nd Europe's largest traditional energy exchange. It plans to move all IPE e=
nergy contracts to its Internet-based system and offer clearing services fo=
r some over-the-counter contracts.=20
Nymex is exploring alliances that could give it a better footing in the new=
 competitive landscape. One idea under review is a joint venture with the C=
hicago Mercantile Exchange to offer e-mini contracts for Nymex products on =
CME's Globex electronic-trading system, the person close to Nymex said.=20
Nymex officials wouldn't confirm whether they're talking with the CME, but =
they said the relationship between the exchanges is a warm one.=20
"Nymex is always open to strategic alliances," Jacobovits said. "There's no=
thing we've agreed to at this point, but we have open dialogue with a numbe=
r of exchanges concerning strategic alliances. We have a good relationship =
with the Chicago Merc, and we certainly would be open to working with them.=
"=20
Shortly after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in New York shut down the Nyme=
x trading floor, the CME said it would be willing to offer Nymex products o=
n its Globex system until Nymex resumed operations, Jacobovits said.=20

STOCKWATCH Enron down, Dynegy up on lingering merger uncertainty

NEW YORK (AFX) - Enron Corp shares were lower, while Dynegy Inc was slightl=

At 11.15 am, Enron shares were trading down 17 cents at 4.84, a decline of =
3.3 pct. Dynegy was up 44 cents at 40.20.
The DJIA was up 57.70 points at 9,892.86. The S&P 500 was up 6.24 points at=
 1,143.27. The Nasdaq composite was up 11.94 points at 1,886.99=20
Earlier, the Wall Street Journal quoted an unnamed source as saying Monday'=

osed buyer Dynegy.=20
Dynegy representatives are planning to work through the weekend evaluating =
the significance of this information as part of their due diligence on Enro=
n, the paper said. It did not specify the nature of the information.=20
In the filing, Enron revealed a number of new financial problems including =
a possible obligation to repay a 690 mln usd note due Nov 27.=20
On Wednesday, the company said it had received an extension on the repaymen=
t until mid-December, which it said was enough time to restructure the debt=
.=20
The company also said it was in active talks with its creditors and expecte=
d to be able to restructure other debt and remain solvent long enough for t=

Dynegy welcomed the news and said it will push ahead in seeking regulatory =
approval for the merger. But investors are concerned that the constant surp=
rises in restated earnings and revelations of liquidity problems at Enron m=
ay cause Dynegy to walk away from the deal.=20
UBS Warburg analyst Ronald Barone lowered Enron's fourth-quarter earnings p=
er share estimate to a loss of 25 cents from earnings of 25 cents, arguing =
that its business will suffer until its liquidity problems are resolved.=20
The analyst cut his full year estimate to 1.10 usd from 1.60 usd and 2002 e=
stimate to 75 cents from 1.65 cents.=20
If his figures prove to be correct, they would make Dynegy's current merger=

"We reiterate that if the merger with Dynegy were to run into obstacles (or=

vestors may question its ability to sustain liquidity (and normal business =
activities) for an extended period of time," Barone said in a note. "Under =
such a scenario, bankruptcy would not be out of the question."=20
Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Curt Launer was more upbeat, and said th=
e share's decline in recent sessions has been overdone.=20
"Our industry contacts and discussions with traders indicate that while tra=
ding with Enron has slowed, it certainly has not stopped," said Launer.=20

USA: Houston economy seen weathering major layoffs.
By Ellen Chang

11/23/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

HOUSTON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Houston's economy, buffered by a broad and dive=
rse tax base, should be able to weather thousands of layoffs from some of t=
he city's major corporations, including energy powerhouse Enron Corp., econ=
omists and analysts said.=20
Financially ailing Enron Corp. , which has 21,000 employees worldwide and i=
s in talks to be bought by Houston-based rival Dynegy Inc. , is the third m=
ajor employer in the city to announce severe financial problems in recent m=
onths. Analysts expect layoffs if the merger occurs.
Continental announced a layoff of 3,000 employees after the Sept. 11 attack=
s and Hewlett-Packard Co.'s plan to buy Compaq Computer Corp. will, if fina=
lized, result in 15,000 layoffs at the two companies. Compaq also announced=
 8,000 layoffs worldwide in July.=20
"It's fair to say that the potential layoffs at Enron and the layoffs at Co=
ntinental, taken alone, are negative factors, although probably small in th=
e grand scope of the Houston economy," said Phil Scheps, director of Housto=
n's finance and administration department.=20
Since last month when Enron became a target of a Securities and Exchange Co=
mmission investigation into financial dealings with partnerships, the energ=
y giant's market share has steadily eroded.=20
While neither Enron nor Dynegy have given any indication of the number of l=
ayoffs that could hit Houston, Barton Smith, director of the Institute for =
Regional Forecasting at the University of Houston, said the layoffs "will b=
e spread out over a long period of time and will not be excessive."=20
Robin Kapiloff, an analyst at Moody's Investors Service, said the city's ef=
forts to diversify its economy over the past decade will protect its revenu=
e collections, even as some of the city's biggest employers suffer. "We're =
watching to see where things go now," she said.=20
Alex Fraser, a director at Standard & Poor's, said the ratings agency isn't=
 concerned about Houston's credit position at this point. "While Enron is c=
ertainly a large player and prominent corporation, we're unclear on what th=
e impact would be."=20
While the fourth largest city in the country experienced a bit of a slowdow=
n since the Sept. 11 attacks, Houston has outperformed the rest of the nati=
on.=20
With a tax base of $87.3 billion in 2001, Houston is also buffered by the T=
exas Medical Center, the city's largest employer. Next year the city's tax =
base is estimated to grow to $95 billion.=20
Still, the national recession, energy price weakness in general, and the in=
itial loss of consumer confidence related to the attacks has caused the cit=
y to reduce its estimate of sales tax growth to 1.5 percent from 5 percent.=
 That revised estimate equals a $13 million reduction in the city's $1.4 bi=
llion budget.=20
But the city's property tax revenue has not been affected. Only a small cha=
nge in property tax collections is expected in 2002 because valuations are =
based on Jan. 1 data and for most of 2001, real estate growth was very larg=
e, Scheps said.=20
While recent economic indicators appear positive, and consumer confidence h=
as quickly rebounded, a better read on the strength of Houston's tax revenu=
e collections will be available in February when the city receives data for=
 the December holiday season, Scheps said.

Dynegy's Decision to Buy Enron Hits Crossroads Amid Rising Financial Woes

11/23/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Even as it reiterated its intention to purchase Enron Corp., Dynegy Inc. is=
 coming under increasing pressure to renegotiate or walk away from the mult=
ibillion-dollar deal, Friday's Wall Street Journal reported.=20
The pressure is stemming from the continuing slide in the price of Enron (E=
NE) shares and the mounting financial problems at the Houston energy-tradin=
g company, the nation's biggest marketer of electricity and natural gas. Du=
ring the past month, Enron has taken a $1 billion write-off of assets, revi=
sed downward the earnings of the past several years and taken a $1.2 billio=
n reduction in shareholder equity.
The problems have been due largely to dealings Enron had with private partn=
erships, run by some of its own executives, under investigation by the Secu=
rities and Exchange Commission. In an SEC filing Monday, Enron disclosed hu=
ndreds of millions of potential additional write-offs as well as the possib=
ility that its weakening financial condition could force it to repay more t=
han $2 billion in loans by the end of the year.=20
As of 4 p.m. Wednesday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron =
shares fell $1.98, or 28%, to $5.01 each after having dropped 23% Tuesday. =
In excess of 115 million shares traded Wednesday, more than four times the =
volume of any other Big Board stock. Enron's bonds also again traded sharpl=
y lower, market observers said.=20
The turmoil spilled over to Dynegy's stock, which also was among the most a=
ctively traded on the New York Stock Exchange. As of 4 p.m. Wednesday, Dyne=
gy (DYN) shares fell $1.94 to $39.76 each.=20
On Wednesday, Dynegy issued a statement in which Chairman and Chief Executi=
ve Chuck Watson said his company was working "to accelerate the regulatory =
approvals required to complete the merger in accordance with the previously=
 announced agreement" though it continued to perform "due diligence" on Enr=
on.=20
Under the merger agreement, Dynegy has opportunities to renegotiate or walk=
 away from the deal if Enron's financial and legal problems become severe e=
nough. However, some observers said it can be difficult to invoke these so-=
called material adverse change clauses. They point to a decision earlier th=
is year by a Delaware Chancery Court judge who forced Tyson Foods Inc. to c=
omplete a planned purchase of IBP Inc. even though Tyson, a Springdale, Ark=
., food-products company, had wanted to cancel the transaction because of a=
 drop in IBP's earnings and accounting problems at an IBP unit.=20
Dynegy officials didn't return calls seeking comment. To complete the deal,=
 two-thirds of Dynegy shareholders and a majority of Enron shareholders wou=
ld have to give their approval. No dates for those votes have been set.=20
One person familiar with the merger plans said the SEC filing Monday by Enr=
on contained information Dynegy hadn't known about. Dynegy representatives =
planned to work through the weekend evaluating the importance of this new i=
nformation as part of the company's due diligence, this person said. It cou=
ldn't be determined what the new information was.=20
The merger agreement, announced Nov. 9, calls for Dynegy to exchange 0.2685=
 share for each of Enron's roughly 850 million fully diluted shares, giving=
 the purchase a value of about $9 billion at Dynegy's current stock price. =
However, from a price standpoint, the deal is appearing less attractive to =
Dynegy.=20
On the day of the merger announcement, Enron shares were trading at about $=
8.63 each, or about 83% of the purchase price under the exchange ratio. As =
of Wednesday, Enron's market price was only about 47% of the merger-formula=
 price. Such a sharp deterioration is unusual following a merger announceme=
nt, when the stock price of the company being acquired generally begins tra=
ding relatively close to the offering price.=20
Sentiment among Wall Street analysts also is turning against the merger. In=
itially, many analysts lauded the merger as a move that would rescue Enron =
and provide a major boost to Houston-based Dynegy. Dynegy and Enron officia=
ls have predicted that the merger, supposed to be completed late next year,=
 would significantly and immediately increase Dynegy's earnings.=20
Now analysts are challenging that assumption. Ron Barone, managing director=
 at UBS Warburg LLC, said he believes that because of Enron's financial pro=
blems, a combined company would actually have lower earnings next year than=
 Dynegy would have by itself. Mr. Barone said he thinks a "likely scenario"=
 is that the merger formula will be renegotiated sharply down to about 0.15=
 Dynegy share for each Enron share.=20

HOUSTON -- Two Enron Corp. workers are suing the company, claiming it endan=
gered their retirement funds.=20
The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Houston under the Employee Retiremen=
t Income Security Act, asserts that Enron encouraged the employees to inves=
t more heavily in company stock just before the stock tanked. The lawsuit w=
as filed by Portland, Ore., utility lineman Roy Rinard and co-worker Steve =
Lacey.
Enron shares have plunged more than 90% over the last several months since =
the departure of the company's chief executive and an accounting controvers=
y that prompted the firm to restate its earnings since 1997, eliminating mo=
re than $580 million of reported income.=20
Steve Berman, managing partner for the law firm of Hagens Berman in Seattle=
, said Enron touted the value of its shares and encouraged employees to put=
 their entire portfolio into Enron stock.=20
Enron officials didn't emphasize the risk and instead painted the situation=
 as positive, especially when the company's stock began to slide, said Berm=
an, who is hoping to get the suit certified as a class action.=20
Berman wants to prove that the company's 401(k) plan executives failed to a=
ct responsibly when they knew about serious business problems. He's also ho=
ping to break new legal ground with his case.=20
The lawsuit is patterned after a case against Lucent Technologies in which =
Lucent employees sued their employer this summer for matching their 401(k) =
contributions with company stock that tanked. That case is still in litigat=
ion.=20
Earlier this year, Rinard, 54, had $472,000 in his Enron 401(k) plan, which=
 had been growing for 21 years.=20
Today, his plan is worth about $40,000. Enron gives its employees their 401=
(k) match in company stock.=20
In January, Enron was trading for $84.87. Wednesday it closed at $5.01 a sh=
are on the New York Stock Exchange.=20
The problem was compounded when many employees, including Rinard, saw Enron=
's stock doing so well that they decided to put their entire account into E=
nron stock.=20
Enron executives had talked about how the stock price was poised to climb a=
bove $100 a share, Rinard told the Houston Chronicle.=20
In addition, Enron employees were not allowed to make trades in the 401(k) =
plan for about a month, starting Oct. 17. That was the day after Enron surp=
rised the market with the news it was taking a $1.01-billion after-tax thir=
d-quarter charge to get out of bad investments.=20
Enron officials, who could not be reached, have said they had planned the l=
ockdown for several months because the company was changing plan administra=
tors.

Portland utility's fate tied to Enron's future
Nigel Hunt
Reuters

11/23/2001

Fourth
C2
(Copyright 2001)

LOS ANGELES -- Oregon's largest utility, Portland General Electric, faces a=
n uncertain future as its parent Enron fights for its life amid a deepening=
 financial crisis, industry experts said Wednesday.=20
Another Oregon utility, Northwest Natural Gas, is due to file next week wit=
h state regulators for approval to take over Portland General. Those same r=
egulators could soon be faced with a similar application from Dynegy as par=
t of a still-pending deal to acquire cash-strapped Enron.
If Enron were to file for bankruptcy before Portland General has been sold,=
 its future could be thrown into the hands of a Texas bankruptcy court, exp=
erts said.=20
Northwest Natural Gas agreed Oct. 8 to acquire Portland General for around =
$1.8 billion, plus about $1.1 billion in assumed debt and preferred stock. =
A month later, Enron announced it had agreed to be acquired by Houston-base=
d Dynegy.=20
"We've been watching this from afar to see how it could impact that sale (P=
ortland General's acquisition by Northwest Natural Gas)," said Roy Hemmingw=
ay, chairman of the Oregon Public Utility Commission.=20
"We have authority if that sale doesn't go through to rule on whether Dyneg=
y can take over Enron," he said.=20
Ratings agency Fitch last week cut Portland General's debt ratings due to "=
uncertainty at its parent Enron." Wednesday, the same agency said a bankrup=
tcy filing by Enron was "highly possible" if the proposed rescue by Dynegy =
collapses.=20
"We haven't seen any credit problems so far, and Portland General isn't in =
the market (buying power for its customers) right now in a big way," Hemmin=
gway said.=20
However, he noted that, "If they really were unable to conduct their busine=
ss because they were not creditworthy we would have to use whatever instrum=
ents are available" to make sure service to customers is maintained. Earlie=
r this year, California was forced to take over buying power for the PG&E u=
nit of Pacific Gas & Electric and Edison International subsidiary Southern =
California Edison after the two utilities saw their credit ratings cut to j=
unk status.=20
Federal regulators have insisted the sellers of wholesale power have the ri=
ght to sell to a creditworthy buyer.=20
California's largest utility, Pacific Gas & Electric, chose to file for ban=
kruptcy because of its mounting debt. In a parallel, consumer advocates fea=
r the fate of the biggest utility in neighboring Oregon could end up in the=
 hands of a bankruptcy judge.=20
Hemmingway said the Oregon Public Utility Commission recently had granted P=
ortland General a rate increase and the utility has "plenty of cash flow cu=
rrently to handle its obligations."=20
"This is nothing like California where that was not the case," he said.=20
Northwest Natural Gas, which is also based in Portland, has set a target of=
 filing next Wednesday with the Oregon commission to take over the utility,=

Enron Shares and Bonds Fall on Concern About Takeover (Update5)
2001-11-23 15:55 (New York)

Enron Shares and Bonds Fall on Concern About Takeover (Update5)

     (Updates with Dynegy comment in fifth paragraph.)

     Houston, Nov. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. shares and bonds
fell for a third day on concern the company's weakened financial
condition and plunging stock price may lead Dynegy Inc. to try to
cancel or rework a takeover of the biggest energy trader.

     Shares of Enron, the most-active U.S. stock, dropped
30 cents, or 6 percent, to $4.71. They fell 45 percent Tuesday and
Wednesday after Enron said it may have to pay more than $9 billion
in debt due by 2003. Enron 6.4 percent bonds due in July 2006 were
bid at 55 cents on the dollar, down from 62 cents on Wednesday,
traders said.

     Enron shares are trading at less than half the value of
Dynegy's offer, which shows investors are questioning whether the
buyout will be completed on the terms agreed to two weeks ago.
Enron's financial woes may prove to be a drag on Dynegy's earnings
next year if the transaction is completed, analysts said.

     ``There are continued doubts about the deal,'' said UBS
Warburg analyst Ronald Barone, who rates Dynegy a ``strong buy''
and doesn't own shares in either company. ``Enron's earnings
aren't what they used to be because they've lost trading business.
Given that, Dynegy has an opportunity to renegotiate the price.''

     Dynegy spokesman John Sousa said the company ``remains
optimistic for the potential of the merger.'' Enron agreed Nov. 9
to the takeover, now valued at about $23 billion in stock and
assumed debt, after a financial crisis threatened it with
bankruptcy.

     On Wednesday, Enron got a three-week reprieve from lenders on
a $690 million note due next week, giving the company more time to
restructure its finances. Dynegy Chief Executive Officer Chuck
Watson said he was ``encouraged'' by the commitment to extend the
note payment, as well as the closing of a $450 million credit
facility, and that Dynegy remained committed to the purchase.

     More than 40 million Enron shares changed hands today, almost
twice their three-month daily average, in a session shortened
because of the Thanksgiving holiday. Enron was the most-active
U.S. stock on Wednesday, with 116 million shares traded. Dynegy
shares rose 64 cents to $40.40 today.

                       Less Than $2 Billion

     In a Securities & Exchange Commission filing Monday, Enron
said it has less than $2 billion in cash and credit lines left. If
the company's cash reserves run too low, Enron is in danger of
seeing its credit rating cut below investment grade. That would
trigger $3.9 billion in debt repayments for two affiliated
partnerships.

     Enron's bankers have met with unidentified investors,
including leveraged buyout firms and two industrial companies, in
a bid to shore up the energy trader's finances with an injection
of as much as $2 billion, the New York Times reported yesterday,
citing unidentified executives close to the companies.

     Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said the company is seeking
$500 million to $1 billion. Enron needs to raise $1 billion to
$1.5 billion in cash within the next 45 days, said Sean Egan,
managing director of Egan-Jones Rating Co.

     ``Their trading operation has burned through cash faster than
the market had expected,'' Egan said.

                         Trading Business

     Traders including Mirant Corp. and Aquila Inc. have said they
shifted transactions away from Enron after its plunging stock
price prompted concerns about creditworthiness. Enron has said
fourth-quarter earnings would be reduced partly by a drop in its
energy-trading business.

     Watson said after the Enron buyout was announced he expected
it to increase 2002 earnings by 35 percent. Analysts said that
can't happen unless Enron recovers lost trading business. Several
have cut their 2002 estimates for Enron. The average estimate of
analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call for next year is
now $1.68 a share, down from $2.14 a month ago.

     Dynegy can cancel or renegotiate if Enron can't meet debt
payments, its trading market collapses, banks demand more
collateral or raise the interest rate for loans, Enron's credit
rating is cut to junk, the SEC cites Enron for securities fraud,
or if Enron's legal liabilities including shareholder suits exceed
$3.5 billion, Egan said.


                     Will Dynegy Renegotiate?

     Dynegy officials were considering whether to try and
renegotiate terms of its agreement with Enron, according to the
New York Times report. Dynegy and Enron are both based in Houston.

     ``Dynegy investors would like to see the company negotiate a
lower price for Enron,'' said Credit Lyonnais securities analyst
Gordon Howald, who rates Dynegy ``buy'' and owns no shares.

     Under the Nov. 9 terms, Enron investors would receive 0.2685
Dynegy share for each share held. At today's closing price, that
values Enron stock at $10.85. A year ago, Enron traded at almost
$80.

     Investors worry that a cancellation of the merger would push
Enron into bankruptcy.

     ``The market is saying there seems to be no obvious Plan B
for Enron and that is what has investors concerned,'' said Eric
Bergson, who helps manage $9 billion of fixed-income assets at
Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. ``The lower bond prices go, what
the market is saying is that there's less chance of this deal
going through.''

KKR, Blackstone Are Among Likely Enron Investors, Analyst Says
2001-11-23 16:20 (New York)

KKR, Blackstone Are Among Likely Enron Investors, Analyst Says

     Houston, Nov. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts &
Co., the Blackstone Group and the Carlyle Group are among the
likely candidates to be approached by Enron Corp. for a private
equity investment to shore up the company's balance sheet, said
industry analyst David Snow of PrivateEquityCentral.Net.

     The firms have cash on hand and have invested in energy
companies in the past. An investment in Enron may look attractive
now that its shares have plunged by 94 percent this year.

     ``Many of the larger, more traditional buyout firms would
find this deal attractive,'' said Snow. ``This is a company that
has real assets that is down in the dumps and has need of capital
when capital is scarce.''

     Enron's bankers met recently with leveraged buyout firms and
two industrial companies to seek an investment, the New York Times
reported, citing executives close to the companies. Enron's stock
fell for a fifth day in six on concern the company's weakened
financial condition may lead Dynegy Inc. to try to cancel or
rework its planned purchase of the rival Houston company.

     Investors may inject as much as $2 billion under arrangements
that would protect them from further declines in Enron's stock,
the Times said. The new investments would be in Enron's
Transwestern Pipeline, which connects natural-gas fields in Texas
to the California market, the newspaper said.

     J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. agreed to terms
that give each of them a $250 million equity stake as part of a
transaction to be completed Monday, officials told the newspaper.

     Buyout firms sometimes make collective bids, pooling their
money and distributing the risk. The firms also like to invest in
industries that are out of favor with public investors and to do
so in partnership with corporate investors, like Dynegy, said
Snow.

     ``You need to know enough about the (energy) business to know
whether it's a good deal, and then you need to be confident in the
Dynegy team,'' he said.

                                KKR

     KKR, the second-biggest private equity firm with $24 billion
in assets, declined comment on Enron through spokeswoman Molly
Morse of Kekst & Co.

     The New York-based firm invested more than $1.3 billion in
DPL Inc., a utility in Dayton, Ohio, and will receive $550 million
of that back from the company after DPL sold $700 million of bonds
in August.

     ``KKR very much gets involved in deals where there's a
corporate partner and they don't have a majority stake,'' Snow
said. ``They would possibly hold it for years, because they like
slow exits.'' KKR is also a possible candidate because it recently
raised a new $5 billion buyout fund.

     Any LBO firm would need assurance about how it will get its
money back on an Enron investment, said Snow.

     ``The thing they have to be cautious about is the exit,'' he
said. ``If there's a chance Dynegy would agree to buy out (the LBO
firms') stake over time, that would give some confidence. But if
the only exit is the public market, that's a little bit dicier.''

     Any private investment also must be large enough to make a
meaningful difference: Enron's market value is $3.7 billion and
Dynegy has proposed paying $23 billion in stock and assumption of
debt. That means the private equity portion would have to approach
$1 billion or more.

     The 20 largest private equity firms have assets of more than
$5 billion under management each, according to Asset Alternatives,
a Wellesley, Massachusetts industry research firm. Still, many of
those firms don't have enough free capital to undertake an
investment of $500 million or more.

     An announcement of an investment may come soon, analysts say.
Energy trading firms such as Mirant Corp. and Aquila Inc. are
doing fewer trades with Enron because of concern that the company
won't be able to finance its business. Enron shares have fallen by
almost half in the past three sessions.

     ``They're going to need this investment within 30 to 45
days,'' said Sean Egan of Egan-Jones Ratings Co. ``They're
spiraling downward and they're going to need some more beyond the
$1.5 billion contributed by'' ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns 26
percent of Dynegy.

                            Other LBOs

     Here's a rundown of the other most likely private equity
partners for Enron:

     --The Carlyle Group could invest through a $1 billion energy
fund it's raising, as well as its general U.S. buyout fund, said
Snow. Carlyle's vice president for corporate communications, Chris
Ullman, declined to comment.

     --Blackstone, which has a history of investing alongside
other corporate partners, recently closed on a $4 billion buyout
fund. Blackstone spokesman John Ford declined to comment on
whether Enron had approached the firm.

     --Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst, which is based in Texas like
Dynegy and Enron. Hicks Muse counts Triton Energy Ltd., an energy
exploration company, among its best investments. The firm recently
raised about $1.5 billion for new investments, about one-third of
what it had hoped to raise, and has said it will focus on ``back-
to-basics'' investments in food, manufacturing and media. Mark
Semer, a spokesman for Hicks Muse who also works for Kekst,
declined comment on Enron.

     Spokesmen for two other firms, Warburg Pincus & Co. and
Credit Suisse First Boston's private equity arm, didn't return
calls seeking comment.

Microsoft MSN Fast Web Access Expansion Slowed by Enron Suit
2001-11-23 11:59 (New York)

Microsoft MSN Fast Web Access Expansion Slowed by Enron Suit

     Redmond, Washington Nov. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp.'s
plans to expand its MSN high-speed Internet service have been
delayed by a lawsuit from Enron Corp., which could cost the
company customers during the holiday season, analysts said.

     MSN had planned to have fast Internet access over telephone
lines available, with help from energy trader Enron, in 45 markets
starting Oct. 25. Instead, the service is now on sale in about 30
markets, said MSN Product Manager Lisa Gurry.

     The latest delay follows a string of apparent bad luck that
has delayed the rollout of Microsoft's fast Internet access
service over the last year. The holidays are typically a popular
time for customers to buy so-called broadband access, often along
with new personal computers purchased or received as gifts.

     ``They have a track record of picking broadband partners that
don't quite work out,'' said Joe Laszlo, senior analyst at market
researcher Jupiter Media Metrix Inc. ``It definitely hurts them
with customers who want broadband right now.''

     Subscribers to fast Internet access services are expected to
grow fourfold by 2006, according to estimates by Jupiter Media
Metrix, while sales of slower Internet access plans decline. Fast
Internet service over phone lines uses digital subscriber line, or
DSL, technology.

                         On Track

     Gurry said Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft is still on
track to have fast access for sale by the end of March to 90
percent of the 45 million to 50 million households that have DSL
available in their neighborhoods.

     ``There is very little growth left in the dial-up access
space for Microsoft or anybody, which leaves them with broadband
as the only potential growth area for the MSN access business,''
said Youssef Squali, an analyst at FAC/Equities, who rates
Microsoft Internet competitor AOL Time Warner Inc. a ``buy.''

     Microsoft also wants to deliver consumer services like music
and video and software updates, which require fast Internet access
for smooth downloads.

     The company originally began a service with NorthPoint
Communications Group Inc., a now-bankrupt provider of fast Web
access. Microsoft has also had difficulty finding partners among
cable companies who use their networks for high-speed service.

     Now Houston-based Enron, which agreed in June to provide the
backbone for a nationwide expansion of MSN's service, is suing.
Enron claimed in its lawsuit that it isn't required to deliver
broadband services if Microsoft hasn't first provided a billing
and ordering system that the biggest software company agreed to
build.

     Enron, which is being acquired by rival Dynegy Inc., recently
disclosed debts of $9.15 billion due by 2003 and restated earnings
for four years.

                        Slower Expansion

     MSN has been selling high-speed access in 14 states under
partnership with Qwest Communications International Inc. for the
last few months. MSN has begun the planned service expansion
outside of those states by working with Enron competitors that MSN
Marketing Director Bob Visse declined to name. The company is also
talking to Enron, he said. Enron didn't return calls for comment.

     Because of the Enron suit the expansion is moving slower than
expected, Visse said. Since Oct. 25, MSN has added service in Los
Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego and Sacramento, California, and
Houston, Dallas, San Antonio and Austin, Texas, giving Microsoft a
total of about 30 markets rather than 45. Plans to expand
marketing are also on hold, Visse said.

     ``It is very unfortunate that we are in the position we are
in,'' said Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer.

     Top U.S. Internet service provider America Online, owned by
AOL Time Warner Inc., has also been slow to get into the high-
speed market, analysts said.

     That doesn't mean Microsoft is in the clear. Laszlo said both
MSN and AOL might pay for their sluggishness with tougher
competition from third-place EarthLink Inc. and from cable and
telephone companies that have more experience selling high-speed
Internet access.

     America Online has more than 31 million subscribers to MSN's
7 million. EarthLink Inc. has 4.77 million subscribers. Laszlo
doesn't think MSN or America Online can build the kind of lead in
the high-speed market that America Online has in the slower dial-
up access market.

                       `Not a Permanent Blow'

     Not that anyone need worry about Microsoft. MSN will be able
to expand its fast Internet access business even with the delays,
Laszlo said.

     ``They are already late in the broadband market so this means
they get a little later,'' he said. ``But broadband will continue
to grow over the next few years and this is definitely not a
permanent blow.''

     Analysts also say Microsoft still needs to find a cable
partner that will let MSN use its network to sell fast access over
cable lines. Cable is more popular than DSL with customers looking
for fast Web service. The five largest cable providers control 51
percent of the U.S. high-speed Internet market. The five largest
sellers of access via phone lines and DSL technology account for
about 33 percent, according to market researcher ARS Inc.

     Microsoft MSN Vice President Yusuf Mehdi said last month the
company may be interested in an investment in AT&T Corp.'s cable-
television unit, which AT&T is considering selling. Ballmer
declined to comment on Microsoft's plans.

I just received a call from a senior guy on the trading side of Deutsche Bank (second in two days, plus one to Mike M from him yesterday) offerring his help as he said with a strong, and very annoying,  british accent, "during this very difficult time at Enron."  He is interested to know if we needed/wanted to sell any of our business units.  I told him we aren't planning to exit any businesses.  I mentioned however, that we always have a view that there is a price for everying, and also mentioned that if they needed help with any of their businesses, we too would like to be of service to them.  

Nice.

Jeff

I never wrote nor implied that I was intending to hedge currency exposure with a third party.  I implied that I will hedge with you guys when and where I deem appropriate in the term structure.

John, 

I don't have all the facts around this transaction, but I don't think you are authorized to hedge currency exposure with outside counterparties as you've outlined in your email to Hickerson, etc.  I'd appreciate some information.

A Rabbi was opening his mail one morning.  Taking the
single sheet of paper from an envelope he found written
on it only one word:  "SCHMUCK."

The next Friday night he announced to his congregants, "I have known many

people who have written letters and forgot to sign their
names.  But this week, I received a letter from someone
who signed his name and forgot to write a letter."

Dear Jeff,

How are you? Hope you had a nice weekend. Will you be kind enough to give me some idea of the schedule after you talk to the head of Japan today? I can assure you I will do a good job there. 

Will you please go to the Wharton undergrad reception next Monday? They will love to have you there. I am going too, let's have more fun!

All the best!

Li

Rick,

As you know we have stopped our agricultural commodity businesses, and therefore do not need any VAR associated with these businesses.  If this VAR is allocated to EGM, I would like to reallocate it within the business unit.  If VAR is approved for specific businesses, EGM will give this VAR back to Corp.

As well, I would like to reclass all softs, grains, and meats on the DPR as "other" and remove those headings.

Thanks

Jeff

We're trying to close an in the money sale with KU.  They called Tom Mcquade yesterday evening to say that they can't deal with us b/c of credit. Their commercial guy suggested that if we want to get this deal done quickly, we should go through their unregulated group - LG&E Fuel Services Incorporated and we need to keep the original contractual language as they initially proposed.

We need to get this deal closed quickly, consequently:

1. We either need to get KU's credit guys comfortable with our credit or do this deal with LG&E Fuel Services Incorporated.
2. Tom, do you feel comfortable with LG&E's Fuel Services Inc. credit? The sale is 300,000tpy for 3 years '02-'04 at $39/t in a roughly $37/t market and dropping. 
3. Wayne, please call their attorney Beth Cocaneougher. She's the one who told their commercial guy they can't deal with us b/c of credit. Apparently she wants to have us revert back to the original contractual language (sounds like a re-trade) and do this deal with LG&E. Please call her to see what language she needs changed beyond what we have already agreed to and see if we can get our credit guys to discuss any concerns that they might have with whoever is a decision maker over there. 

Thanks,
Lenny

Cathy will be sending out a notification that the staff meeting is on -- direct reports only please.

I was able to reach most of you tonight, but for those I didn't, please be prepared to discuss:

how you plan to notify your affected ee's (phone call the night before, one-on-one meetings as people arrive, group meeting)
what resources you will need ie; HR support, security, etc.
a designated point person in your team to be a central contact for getting personal belongings to affected employees, filing final expense reports, etc. -- this is probably your admin coordinator even if they delgate the work to someone else
ensure that you have an updated phone list for your group if you plan to notify by phone

I will tell you what I know about the layoff process and go over decisions we need to make as EGM on how the logistics will work.  There will be a training for business unit heads Monday afternoon around 2pm; anyone who will be notifying affected employees will need to attend this training.

Finally, I will assemble a list of questions you have as I'm sure you will have more questions than I have answers.

See you tomorrow,
Shanna

As we continue to deal with the recent tragedy, we have launched an additional
resource for you to communicate with one another:  the Wharton Community
Discussion Board (http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/alumni, then select the
"Community Discussion Board").  Please share information about all members of
our community (alumni, students, faculty, staff, corporate partners and friends)
and about your loved ones and family (spouses, partners, children, parents,
brothers and sisters).

There are two forums on the site:  "Open Discussion" is a place you can share
your thoughts and feelings about the recent events.  On "Information on Friends,
Family and Colleagues", share news about fellow Wharton grads and loved ones.
We continue to encourage you to use the "Family and Friends Status Database"
(http://www.finebrand.com/statuses/affiliation.cfm?prefix=Wharton) for status
information, and use this discussion forum for extended news and updates.
Please be aware that due to the high amount of traffic on the "Family and Friends

Hello Jeff-
Talked with Larry Lawyer yesterday on proposal for EGM to take on a small team from the Structured Finance Group.  Larry is on board with the concept but reserves opinion on the scaleability of the business. 
 
We have retooled the business model to concentrate on bigger return projects, resulting in a plan that better fits the Enron formula.  Additionally the skill set of the team (3) will provide additional value and leverage to existing EGM transactions-especially in the area of moving assets off balance sheet. Jeremy Thirsk has first hand knowledge as we have helped structure a Japan trade. Also, Ray Bowen will take on a small team at EIM, as he has bought into the value return.
 
Larry suggests it is worthwhile for EGM to consider the proposal further. To this end, I request a meeting with you anytime on Tuesday or Wednesday next week. I return to London on Thursday.   
Please respond to george.delcanto@enron.com <mailto:george.delcanto@enron.com> .
Will forward revised business plan and background material prior to meeting.
 
thanks and regards,
George

Thanks for the response, I will remind you on Monday.  Worse case I can do the behavioral, or one of the first rounders can stay over an extra day.  The interviews are two 30 min, back to back.  One on one.

Thank you sir and I will keep you posted.

Jeff,
 
Per our conversation earlier this month I discussed with Vince Kaminski the possibility of getting a quant. guy on permanent loan to our group to help manage the more complex analyses I want our guys to be doing.
 
Vince is amenable to letting us have one of his managers.  However, because is group is stretched thin and he wants to keep his headcount flat, he would want to hire a replacement and charge the manager we get to us.
 
I would also want to hire an analyst to help this quant. guy with general research ideas and data gathering.
 
Is this acceptable to you?
 
Jeff

Thanks again for all of your help today.  It was a great meeting!

I forgot to tell you as we were walking out.  The price for the Bel Geddes
Skyscraper Cocktail service is $7500.  Based on my preliminary price checks
(so far) it seems fair and certainly less that the boys would charge. What
do you think?  I am of half a mind to call the boys and find out what they
would be asking but I think that it would tip our hand....

Jeff -
I appreciated your comments in the meeting about not jumping to conclusions of guilt. 

Obviously, as I am friends w/ at least three people who were affected, I'm concerned about the perception of yesterday's events. I would like to say that while I understand that red flags were raised, the procedure for dealing with what are, according to you, only suspicions seems to me not only draconian but also extremely counterproductive to the general morale of everyone who relies on the fundamentals' group's strong work.

I assume that the procedure was not concocted by you and trust that, if there are opportunities to question/change it, you will add my views to those of others who think similarly.
Thanks very much,
Russ

Oh my god...I think I asked someone about you just last week. How weird is  
that? Are you still in Houston??!! If so, did you survive the flood?  
Yes, we're in Tampa--we are three now, including Saul(10 months). Actually, I  
was in touch with Stefanie in the last year or so b/c her dad was my doctor.  
I've always wondered how Sarah is doing. I heard she's living in San  
Francisco and that she got married recently. Is that true? If you have her  
e-mail, I'd love to be in touch with her. 
What is Enron & what do you do there? By the way, what ever happened to Lisa  
Schiffman?  
I still work for Hillel(going on 10 years!). I do fundraising in  
Sarasota($$$)and work with a few campuses across Florida that need jumpstarts  
for their Hillel/Jewish student groups. Brian has a job with a small(250  
family) congregation here. We'll be here for at least 5 more years, through  
his next contract. We built a great house which I never want to leave. Saul  
is lots of fun! 
It's really great to hear from you. Please fill me in on the past several  
years of your life. 
Best, 
Mimi

She is like 31 years old and a great gal.  I attach a photo that was taken of us in NYC at Adam Dell's apartment.  Let me know what you think?  Her numbers are:

Mary and Sam,

The attached schedule details the funds of $124.7 million to be received today from Brokerage accounts.
$85 million is being received from our funds and $40 million from other entities.  Everyone was very cooperative in getting this done this morning.
Wiring instructions have been send to the Brokers for the full $124.7 million.

We have added the Wiring instructions and exact amounts to the schedule.

David/Heidi and presume Quilkey are really freaking over here regarding short term capital allocation and liabilities they take on signing off coal deals. Obviously difficult to get a real feel for things in this part of the world but John Suttle has been telling David/Heidi that there is little chance of us getting any allocation for this deal. Heidi is resigning as a Director of ECAP and hence we have noone to sign off on deals this end. We are looking at changing Bengalla deal to ECS if possible - if not one of us down here will have to be given necessary authority to sign off on this deal if we finally go ahead. How do we actually find out what the "f " is going on?? 

Cheers
Jez

Greg,

Our P&L losses over the last few days have been due to four things primarily.

1)  We have been short crude, and are still short, in a $2.00 up move.  (today the market was down)
2)  We are liquidating many of our portfolios, and are paying large bid/offers.  We are also abandoning some of our P+ options with Koch since credit has indicated our inability to access cash will completely hamper our ability to exercise puts. 
3)  As a company we are short vol, and vol has been extremely strong, and continues to move against us.
4)  being long physical inventories in europe in a falling market.  In addition, none of our counterparts/customers/competitors are willing to take the product from us.

We will continue to work out of positions.

It was an irresistible proposition: Borrow billions of dollars, pay no inte=
rest, reap millions in tax breaks, and then wait for the debt to simply dis=
appear. That was the promise of zero-coupon convertible bonds, and companie=
s from Enron to Merrill Lynch binged on what seemed like free money.=20
But, of course, there was a catch: For this scenario to play out, a company=
's stock price had to rise sharply--and quickly. That's because investors b=
ought the bonds in the hope of converting them into equity--if the stock ta=
nked, the bonds would no longer be worth converting. So to make them more a=
ttractive to buyers, companies had to build in an escape hatch: If the stoc=
k price failed to rise sufficiently, investors could "put" (that is, sell) =
the bonds back to the company--in many cases, after just one year.
And that's exactly what's about to happen--to the tune of some $65 billion =
over the next three years. Stock prices have fallen so far that for at leas=
t half of these special hybrids, the prospect of conversion is now absurd. =
It simply won't happen. So bondholders are looking to get their money back =
the first chance they can. And because of the put feature, that is possible=
. Suddenly companies like Tyco, Comcast, and dozens more are on the hook fo=
r billions of dollars in debt and interest they thought they'd never have t=
o pay.=20
That could be very bad news for shareholders of these companies. After all,=
 they're the ones who are going to be picking up the tab when all that debt=
 comes due. Huge chunks of cash will disappear from balance sheets to repay=
 bondholders. Companies without enough cash-- and the majority fall into th=
is camp--are likely to face skyrocketing interest charges when they borrow =
money anew. That means sharply reduced earnings. Especially at risk are inv=
estors in companies with poor credit ratings--prime candidates for killer r=
efinancing costs. Some companies may even be forced to issue stock to pay o=
ff the debt, creating significant shareholder dilution, especially at curre=
nt depressed prices. To make matters worse, this is happening at a time whe=
n the economy is barreling downhill and corporate profits are already shrin=
king. "This is a ticking time bomb," warns Margaret Patel, manager of the P=
ioneer High Yield Bond fund, a top-performing junk fund.=20
The seeds of this mess were sown in mid-2000, when the stock market started=
 to falter. Companies in search of capital balked at the thought of selling=
 stock while their share prices were struggling. Zero-coupon convertible bo=
nds presented an attractive alternative because companies didn't have to ma=
ke cash interest payments on the bonds (hence the name "zero"). Instead iss=
uers offered an up-front discount--for instance, investors would buy a bond=
 for $700 and collect $1,000 when it matured.=20
Companies also gave investors the right to convert the bonds into a fixed n=
umber of common shares. But the bonds were structured so that conversion wo=
uld make sense only if the stock price rose significantly--in many cases, b=
y more than 50%. With that protective feature (called the conversion premiu=
m), zeros took off. Corporate issuers would pay no interest, and once their=
 stock prices had climbed back to acceptable levels, the debt would be swep=
t away into equity. "If the bonds are converted, it's a home run for everyb=
ody," says Jonathan Cohen, vice president of convertible-bond analysis at D=
eutsche Bank.=20
That four-bagger, of course, depends entirely on the stock price rising. If=
 it doesn't, the bondholders, armed with that handy put feature, can simply=
 sell the bonds back to the company. Great for bondholders, but not so hot =
for the company or its shareholders. But, hey, what are the odds of that ha=
ppening? "CFOs and CEOs believe that their stock will just continue to go u=
p," says Cohen. "They don't worry about the bond getting put."=20
If all this seems a little complicated, that's because it is. A real-life e=
xample should help. California-based electric utility Calpine issued $1 bil=
lion in zeros in April to refinance existing debt. At the time, the company=
's stock was trading at about $55 a share--severely undervalued in the opin=
ion of company management. "We really didn't want to sell equity at that po=
int," says Bob Kelly, Calpine's senior vice president of finance. So the co=
mpany instead opted to sell zeros, setting the conversion premium at a heft=
y 37%.=20
Still, with no cash interest payments and a stock price that had to rise si=
gnificantly to make conversion worthwhile, the bonds weren't exactly a scre=
aming buy for investors. So Calpine added the put feature: Investors could =
sell the bonds back to the company after one year at the full purchase pric=
e, eliminating any downside risk.=20
Things haven't exactly worked out as management had hoped. The stock has si=
nce plummeted to $25, and it now has to triple before conversion makes sens=
e. So it's looking as though Calpine will be liable for the $1 billion in b=
orrowed money when investors get the chance to put the bonds this April. Th=
ere's also the refinancing cost. According to Kelly, Calpine's borrowing ra=
te could run in the neighborhood of 8.5%--an extra $85 million per year in =
cash. "Obviously, nobody plans for their stock to go down," Kelly says. "I =
don't think there was one person around who thought the bond would be put."=
=20
Calpine's potential costs are particularly high because its credit rating i=
s straddling junk. "If you are a borderline investment-grade company, a fin=
ancing of this nature is not necessarily the most appropriate thing in the =
world," notes Anand Iyer, head of global convertible research at Morgan Sta=
nley. The problem is, there are a slew of companies with far worse credit r=
atings out there: Jeff Seidel, Credit Suisse First Boston's head of convert=
ible-bond research, estimates that about half of all zeros outstanding fall=
 into the junk category. And others are at risk of having their ratings dow=
ngraded before the put date. Today, with junk yielding as much as 5 1/2 per=
centage points above bonds rated investment grade, refinancing can be a pri=
cey proposition.=20
Contract manufacturer Solectron is one that could well get hit by the high =
price of junk. It has $845 million in zeros that it will probably have to b=
uy back this January, and another $4.2 billion coming down the pike over th=
e next couple of years. Because of slower- than-expected sales, the company=
 was recently put on negative credit watch by three rating agencies. And if=
 Solectron's credit is downgraded, the zeros would slide into junk status, =
a situation that could cost the company--and its shareholders--tens of mill=
ions of dollars in refinancing charges.=20
Refinancing isn't the only worrisome cost associated with these zeros. Comp=
anies pay hefty investment banking fees to sell their bonds--up to 3% of th=
e amount raised. If the debt is sold back, many will have spent millions fo=
r what essentially amounted to a one-year loan. "They're getting bad advice=
," claims one banker who didn't want to be named. "Look at the fee the bank=
er earned and look at the kind of financing risk the company got into."=20
As if those potential consequences were not scary enough, shareholders can =
also get whacked when the bonds are first issued. That's because some 40% a=
re bought by hedge funds, which short the company's stock (sell borrowed sh=
ares with the intention of buying them back at a lower price) at the same t=
ime that they buy the bonds. If the stock goes down, the shorts make money =
from their position. If it goes up, they profit by converting the bond to s=
tock. This hedging strategy almost always causes the stock to plummet, at l=
east for a while. Grocery chain Supervalu, for example, recently lost 10% o=
f its market cap the day it announced it was issuing $185 million in zeros.=
=20
Despite all the pitfalls, the love affair with such Pollyanna bonds continu=
es, thanks in large part to the slick tax and accounting loopholes they pro=
vide. In fact, the hit on earnings per share can be the lowest of any form =
of financing. Even better, thanks to a wrinkle in the tax code, companies c=
an rake in huge tax savings by deducting far more interest than they're act=
ually paying. All they have to do is agree to pay small amounts of interest=
 if certain conditions prevail. Verizon Communications, for instance, would=
 pay 0.25% annual interest on its $3 billion in zero bonds if its stock pri=
ce falls below 60% of the issue's conversion price. In the eyes of the IRS,=
 oddly, that clause enables the company to take a yearly interest deduction=
, for tax purposes, of 7.5%--the same rate it pays on its regular debt. (Wh=
y? Trust us, you don't want to know.) That adds up to an annual deduction o=
f more than $200 million, even if Verizon never shells out a dime in intere=
st. Not surprisingly, more than half of the zeros issued in 2001 contain si=
milar clauses. "It's an incredible deal for them," says Vadim Iosilevich, w=
ho runs a hedge fund at Alexandra Investment Management. "Not only are they=
 raising cheap money, they're also doing tax arbitrage."=20
So despite the enormous risks to shareholders, companies continue to issue =
zeros at a steady clip: According to ConvertBond.com, seven new issues, tot=
aling $3.5 billion, have been sold since Oct. 1 alone. "I think the power o=
f the tax advantage is going to keep them around," says CSFB's Seidel. Call=
 it greed or just blind optimism that the markets will recover quickly--it =
doesn't really matter. Either way, it's the shareholders who'll be left pay=
ing the bill.=20

Manager's Journal: What Enron Did Right
By Samuel Bodily and Robert Bruner

11/19/2001
The Wall Street Journal
A20
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

This is a rough era for American business icons. Subject to the vagaries of=
 age (Jack Welch), product failure (Ford/Firestone tires), competition (Luc=
ent, AT&T), technology (Hewlett-Packard and Compaq), and dot-bomb bubbles (=
CMGI), managers and their firms remind us that being an icon is risky busin=
ess. The latest example is Enron, whose fall from grace has resulted in a p=
roposed fire sale to Dynegy.=20
Once considered one of the country's most innovative companies, Enron becam=
e a pariah due to lack of transparency about its deals and the odor of conf=
licts of interest. The journalistic accounts of Enron's struggles drip with=
 schadenfreude, hinting that its innovations and achievements were all a mi=
rage.
We hold no brief regarding the legal or ethical issues under investigation.=
 We agree that more transparency about potential conflicts of interest is n=
eeded. High profitability does not justify breaking the law or ethical norm=
s. But no matter how the current issues resolve themselves or what fresh re=
velations emerge, Enron has created an enormous legacy of good ideas that h=
ave enduring value.=20
-- Deregulation and market competition. Enron envisioned gas and electric p=
ower industries in the U.S. where prices are set in an open market of biddi=
ng by customers, and where suppliers can freely choose to enter or exit. En=
ron was the leader in pioneering this business.=20
Market competition in energy is now the dominant model in the U.S., and is =
spreading to Europe, Latin America, and Asia. The winners have been consume=
rs, who have paid lower prices, and investors, who have seen competition fo=
rce the power suppliers to become much more efficient. The contrary experie=
nce of California, the poster child of those who would re-regulate the powe=
r industry, is an example of not enough deregulation.=20
-- Innovation and the "de-integration" of power contracts. Under the old re=
gulated model of delivering gas and electricity, customers were offered a o=
ne-size-fits-all contract. For many customers, this system was inflexible a=
nd inefficient, like telling a small gardener that you can only buy manure =
by the truckload. Enron pioneered contracts that could be tailored to the e=
xact needs of the customer.=20
To do this, Enron unbundled the classic power contract into its constituent=
 parts, starting with price and volume, location, time, etc., and offered c=
ustomers choices on each one. Again, consumers won. Enron's investors did t=
oo, because Enron earned the surplus typically reaped by inventors. Arguabl=
y, Enron is the embodiment of what economist Joseph Schumpeter called the "=
process of Creative Destruction." But creative destroyers are not necessari=
ly likable, pleasant folks, which may be part of Enron's problem today.=20
-- Minimization of transaction costs and frictions. Enron extended the logi=
c of de-integration to other industries. An integrated paper company, for i=
nstance, owns forests, mills, pulp factories, and paper plants in what amou=
nts to a very big bet that the paper company can run all those disparate ac=
tivities better than smaller, specialized firms. Enron argued that integrat=
ed firms and industries are riddled with inefficiencies stemming from burea=
ucracy and the captive nature of "customers" and "suppliers." Enron envisio=
ned creating free markets for components within the integrated chain on the=
 bet that the free-market terms would be better than those of the internal =
operations. The development of free-market benchmarks for the terms by whic=
h divisions of integrated firms do business with each other is very healthy=
 for the economy.=20
-- Exploiting the optionality in networks. In the old regulated environment=
, natural gas would be supplied to a customer through a single dedicated pi=
peline. Enron envisioned a network by which gas could be supplied from a nu=
mber of possible sources, opening the customer to the benefits of competiti=
on, and the supplier to the flexibility of alternative sourcing strategies.=
 Enron benefited from controlling switches on the network, so that they cou=
ld nimbly route the molecules or electrons from the best source at any mome=
nt in time to the best use, and choose when and where to convert molecules =
to electrons. This policy, picked up by others in the industry, created tre=
mendous value for both customers and suppliers.=20
-- Rigorous risk assessment. The strategy of tailored contracts could easil=
y have broken the firm in the absence of a clear understanding of the tradi=
ng risks that the firm assumed, and of very strong internal controls. Enron=
 pioneered risk assessment and control systems that we judge to be among th=
e best anywhere. Particularly with the advent of Enron Online, where Enron =
made new positions valued at over $4 billion each day, it became essential =
to have up-to-the-second information on company-wide positions, prices and =
ability to deliver.=20
The unexpected bad news from Enron has little to do with trading losses by =
the firm, but with fears among trading partners about Enron's ability to fi=
nance its trading activity. In a world where contracts and trading portfoli=
os are too complex to explain in a sound bite, counterparties look to a thi=
ck equity base for assurance. It was the erosion in equity, rather than tra=
ding risk, that destroyed the firm.=20
-- A culture of urgency, innovation and high expectations. Enron's corporat=
e culture was the biggest surprise of all. The Hollywood stereotype of a ut=
ility company is bureaucratic, hierarchical, formal, slow, and full of excu=
ses. And the stodgy images of a gas pipeline company -- Enron only 15 years=
 ago -- is even duller and slower. Enron became bumptious, impatient, lean,=
 fast, innovative, and demanding. It bred speed and innovation by giving it=
s professionals unusual freedom to start new businesses, create markets, an=
d transfer within the firm.=20
Success was rewarded with ample compensation and fast promotion, and an ope=
n-office design fostered brainstorming. The firm's organization and culture=
 was by all accounts not a safe haven for those who believe the role of a l=
arge corporation is to fulfill entitlements for jobs. This was a lightning =
rod for the firm's detractors. And yet, it could serve as a model for more =
hide-bound enterprises to emulate.=20
Enron was a prolific source of compelling new ideas about the transformatio=
n of American business. It created a ruckus in once-quiet corners of the bu=
siness economy. It rewrote the rules of competition in almost every area in=
 which it did business. It thrived on volatility.=20
The proposed sale of Enron to Dynegy risks the loss of a major R&D establis=
hment, especially given Dynegy's track record as a second mover following E=
nron's lead. Beyond what is likely to be a difficult and time-consuming ant=
itrust review, Dynegy's greater challenge will be to find a way to make Enr=
on's spirit of innovation its own. Or so we all should hope, because prospe=
rity depends on the ability of firms to reinvent themselves and remake thei=
r industries.=20

J.P. Morgan Wins (by Not Losing as Much)
By Susanne Craig
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

11/19/2001
The Wall Street Journal
C1
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

You know things are bad on Wall Street when the winner of a stock-selection=
 contest can't come close to breaking even.=20
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.'s portfolio was the only one in The Wall Street Jou=
rnal's quarterly stock-picking survey to slide less than 10% during the thr=
ee months ended Sept. 30. The value of its stock basket fell 8.6% during th=
e third quarter.
Just six of the 15 financial firms managed to beat the benchmark Standard &=
 Poor's 500-stock index, which dropped 14.7% during the period. Among the s=
tar performers that came to J.P. Morgan's rescue: Northrop Grumman Corp., S=
BC Communications Inc. and Procter & Gamble Co.=20
"It has turned into a real stock-picker's market," says J.P. Morgan equity =
strategist Douglas Cliggott. "In the first half, the market bought cyclical=
 stocks, such as credit cards and brokers, in hopes of a recovery. We don't=
 think those stocks will get interesting until sometime in 2003." Instead, =
the firm's portfolio is weighted toward health care and consumer staples, a=
s well as cyclical stocks such as energy and farm equipment.=20
The quarter was among the roughest in years for Wall Street investors. The =
terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 helped contribute to the stock-market losses,=
 which drove down the value of all portfolios in the survey, though the mar=
kets have since recovered to their pre-Sept. 11 levels. The last time the g=
roup posted results this bad was during the third quarter of 1998, during t=
he Asian financial crisis.=20
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Credit Suisse Group's Credit Suisse First Bost=
on finished at the bottom of the pack, falling 23.2% and 30.1% respectively=
. The performance of last-place finisher CSFB was dragged down by losses at=
 companies such as Veritas Software Corp. (down 72.3% in the quarter), Prae=
cis Pharmaceuticals Inc. (down 64.8%) and software provider Amdocs Ltd. (do=
wn 51%).=20
For CSFB, "it was not a good stock-picking quarter, that's for sure," says =
Al Jackson, the firm's global head of equity research. "It was our tech and=
 telecom . . . and the events of Sept. 11 that hurt us."=20
Credit Suisse First Boston recently changed the approach to its model portf=
olio, opting against sector weightings, Mr. Jackson says. This strategy has=
 hurt CSFB in recent quarters, because of the steep slump in areas such as =
technology and telecom. The firm recently added a number of Old Economy sto=
cks to its portfolio, such as Citigroup Inc., Dow Chemical Co. and Gannett =
Co. Says Mr. Jackson: "We are going back to our roots and asking what our b=
est ideas are."=20
Like CSFB, Goldman was hit by a drop in the share price of technology compa=
nies, such as Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (down 56.5% in the qua=
rter). Its portfolio was also dragged down by shares of embattled Enron Cor=
p. (down 44.3%). Morgan Stanley and Royal Bank of Canada's RBC Dain Rausche=
r, which placed 6th and 12th respectively, also have the energy company on =
their lists.=20
In addition to Enron, stocks hard it by the terrorist attacks, such as lodg=
ing giant Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc., Walt Disney Co. and air=
lines such as Skywest Inc., also hurt the portfolio performance of many sec=
urities firms.=20
It is unlikely people will buy any company's entire recommended list at one=
 time. The Journal survey is intended to give investors an idea of how thei=
r portfolio would look if they let the professionals do all the picking. Ca=
lculations in the quarterly survey, done for the Journal by Zacks Investmen=
t Research in Chicago, take into account capital gains or losses, dividends=
 and theoretical commissions of 1% on each trade.=20
Overall, Edward D. Jones & Co., of St. Louis, emerged with the most consist=
ent results across the board, placing second in the quarter and for the yea=
r. Its 85% return over five years is the best of the group and ahead of the=
 total return for the S&P 500 of 62.7%. Perhaps more than any other firm, E=
dwards Jones takes a buy-and-hold approach to investing, making very few ch=
anges to its portfolio from quarter to quarter, or even year to year.=20
"It's the old story of the tortoise and the hare, and we believe slow and s=
teady wins the race," says David Otto, Edward Jones director of research. "=
We are really, really proud of the five-year number. We believe in getting =
rich, slowly."=20
On a quarterly basis, the portfolio of Prudential Securities Inc., a unit o=
f Prudential Financial, came in second only to J.P. Morgan, falling 11.8%. =
However, investors sitting with the stocks Prudential recommends haven't do=
ne as well in the long run. The value of its basket of stocks has fallen 45=
.9% in the past year, finishing ahead of only Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.=
, which posted a one-year loss of 54.9%.=20
Seven firms managed to beat the S&P 500 index during the past 12 months, wh=
ich fell 26.6% in the period.=20
Lehman, which finished last in the survey in the second quarter thanks to i=
ts heavy weighting in technology, managed to move up in the rankings this q=
uarter. This primarily stemmed from its annual shuffle of the 10 stocks in =
its portfolio, known as its "Ten Uncommon Values." This time around, the fi=
rm's portfolio slipped 18.4% in the quarter, for an 11th place finish. Just=
 one of its 10 stocks, Washington Mutual Inc., managed to eke out a positiv=
e return, of 3.1%. Its biggest quarterly loser: Energy company Mirant Corp.=
, which fell 36.3% in the period.=20

German Bank Is in Talks With Enron To Buy a Unit
By SUZANNE KAPNER

11/19/2001
The New York Times
Page 2, Column 6
c. 2001 New York Times Company

LONDON, Nov. 18 -- A large German bank is in talks to buy Wessex Water from=
 the Enron Corporation, people close to the discussions said today.=20
Enron is looking to sell Wessex Water, of Britain, as well as other noncore=
 assets in India and Brazil, after a financial crisis nearly brought its ma=
in energy trading business to a halt. That crisis led to Enron's decision e=
arlier this month to be acquired by Dynegy Inc., a much smaller rival.
The German Bank, Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale of Dusseldorf, or Wes=
tLB, is among several suitors for Wessex Water, people close to the discuss=
ions said. The sale has also attracted the attention of industry rivals lik=
e Thames Water, owned by RWE of Germany. But such a combination would most =
likely incur a long review by regulators, who might either block the merger=
 on antitrust grounds, or exact stiff concessions, industry experts said.=
=20
Wessex Water is likely to be sold for more than $:1 billion ($1.4 billion) =
but less than the $:1.4 billion that Enron paid for it in 1998, analysts sa=
id.=20
''In hindsight, we made some very bad investments in noncore businesses,'' =
Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive, told analysts in a co=
nference call last week. Those investments ''have performed far worse than =
we ever could have imagined,'' he said, citing the Azurix water business, o=
f which Wessex Water is a part, and energy assets in Brazil and India.=20
Executives from Enron were not immediately available for comment today. Wes=
tLB executives declined to comment.=20
WestLB has been aggressively pursuing acquisitions in Britain, bidding for =
British Telecommunications' phone network and the nation's railway tracks c=
ontrolled by the troubled Railtrack, which is restructuring under governmen=
t supervision. Neither of those bids has progressed beyond the initial stag=
es.=20
Last summer, WestLB helped finance the management buyout of the Mid Kent Wa=
ter Company through Swan Capital, its private equity vehicle.

Credit Markets
Bond Boom Isn't Likely to Lift Economy As Corporations Swap Old Debt for Ne=
w
By Jathon Sapsford

When AT&T last week completed the second-biggest bond sale in history -- ca=
pping one of the busiest bond periods in years -- it came as welcome news a=
mid fears of a credit crunch. Here was new money, meaning new spending on p=
lants, equipment and jobs that could help pull the economy out of its slump=
.=20
That $10.9 billion AT&T deal, and a slew of similar bond deals from big com=
panies ranging from Boeing and Anheuser-Busch to Kraft Foods and General Mo=
tors, may not provide as big of a boost as economists are banking on. That =
is because corporations, like homeowners, are in the midst of a refinancing=
 boom.
Corporations are hitting the market not just because rates are cheap, but b=
ecause they often can't get money in other crucial markets. In particular, =
they are sidestepping the commercial paper market -- short-term corporate I=
OUs used to finance day-to-day operations, where rates traditionally are lo=
west -- because investors are unwilling to finance many well-known corporat=
ions.=20
The result has been a huge jump in bond sales, the majority of which are us=
ed to reduce existing debt. Since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, about $13=
5 billion in investment-grade bonds have been sold, up from about $78 billi=
on in the year-earlier period. Overall issuance this year is likely to set =
a record, clearing $600 billion, compared with $411 billion in 2000.=20
"The driving force behind this surge in bond issuance is refinancing short-=
term commercial paper to long-term debt," says John Lonski, chief economist=
 at Moody's Investors Service, a credit-rating agency.=20
Usually, rising bond issuance presages economic growth. In 1991, corporatio=
ns sold a record number of bonds to exploit falling interest rates. But the=
n, companies poured much of the money they raised back into their operation=
s, a flurry of investment that foreshadowed the economic boom of the late 1=
990s.=20
This time around, the surge in bond deals won't pump in enough new money to=
 the economy to make a dramatic difference. Though, as in the case of the m=
illions of homeowners who are refinancing their mortgages to lower monthly =
payments, it could help ease some pressure on stretched corporate-balance s=
heets and help to fund some of the companies' day-to-day operations.=20
Not all of the money being raised is to refinance short-term debt, of cours=
e, and the string of bond deals shows that many of the nation's biggest bor=
rowers have ready access to funding if they need it.=20
But most companies are similar to AT&T, which last week provided the bigges=
t refinancing example yet.=20
Over the next three months, the telecom company was facing $6.5 billion in =
expiring commercial paper. Under normal conditions, corporations pay off ma=
turing commercial paper by "rolling over" that debt, or issuing new commerc=
ial paper to replace the old. But rolling over commercial paper became much=
 harder for AT&T after Moody's cut the company's short-term and long-term c=
redit ratings. Through the bond deal, AT&T raised money at relatively attra=
ctive rates while avoiding the difficulties of the commercial-paper market.=
=20
Other companies facing downgrades also are scrambling to find alternatives =
to the commercial-paper market through bonds, loans or revolving credit lin=
es. "The ripple effects of this are being felt throughout the capital marke=
ts," says Meredith Coffey, senior vice president at Loan Pricing Corp., a d=
ebt-market-analysis company.=20
For the most extreme cases, the bond markets don't offer refuge. Enron, ham=
mered by a third-quarter loss of $618 million that led to a string of downg=
rades, drew down $3.3 billion from its emergency bank credit line to repay =
investors in its commercial paper. It then turned to its banks for an addit=
ional $1 billion loan to pay off more commercial-paper investors, thus tidi=
ng it over until it could merge with rival Dynegy.=20
Most investment-grade companies aren't nearly so bad off, and thus have rea=
dy access to bond investors. General Motors, for instance, had little troub=
le selling $6 billion in debt last month, while Ford Motor easily sold bond=
s totalling $9.4 billion.=20
But the surge in bond sales masks signs that even investment-grade companie=
s are having trouble convincing investors that they are good for their mone=
y.=20
Take Ford. Standard & Poor's and Moody's downgraded Ford's debt ratings las=
t month to triple-B-plus and single-A-3, respectively. With that rating, Fo=
rd is far enough down the spectrum of investment-grade debt that many of th=
e ultraconservative investors in commercial paper won't touch it, meaning t=
hat it had to turn to corporate bonds to refinance its debt. Ford concedes =
that a big reason it is selling bonds was to avoid the trouble in the comme=
rcial-paper market.=20
Boyce Greer, the money-market group leader at Fidelity Investments, says he=
 often stops buying the commercial paper of a corporation at the first sign=
 of eroding profitability -- even before they get downgraded. "You can't wa=
it around for a rating agency [to downgrade a company]," he says.=20
Moody's has downgraded five times as many corporations as it has raised so =
far this year. Thus, the market for corporate commercial paper has shrunk t=
o $1.4 trillion at the end of October, down from $1.6 trillion at the end o=
f last year.=20
---=20
Friday's Credit Markets=20
Last week was a brutal time to own Treasurys. The market sold off so sharpl=
y as to push yields, which move inversely to prices, almost back up to wher=
e they stood before the terrorist attacks. It was the worst bond selloff si=
nce 1987, according to economists at Banc One Capital Markets.=20
Losses were heaviest in issues like the two-year note, the most sensitive t=
o expectations about Federal Reserve policy. Since hitting a record low of =
2.30% on Nov. 7, the two-year yield has risen 0.80 percentage point to 3.05=
%. In the same period, the 30-year bond yield has risen 0.50 percentage poi=
nt to 5.27%.=20
At 4 p.m. Friday, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was down 1 3/32 point=
s from late Thursday, or $10.94 per $1,000 face value, at 100 25/32. Its yi=
eld jumped to 4.897% from 4.756% Thursday.=20
The 30-year Treasury bond's price fell 1 19/32 to 100 25/32 to yield 5.317,=
 up from 5.211% Thursday.=20
Why the selloff? People in the market cite a shift toward the view that the=
 U.S. economy may finally be on the brink of recovery. That means the Fed m=
ay not need to employ many more rate cuts to get growth back on track.=20

Enron Corp. investors hope the energy trader's third-quarter report to the =
Securities and Exchange Commission will answer some of the questions that s=
ent its shares tumbling and led to a proposed sale to rival Dynegy Inc.=20
Enron, which has been criticized for failing to clearly explain how it make=

y the company and affiliated partnerships, as well as any planned job cuts =
and other cost-saving moves related to Dynegy's $24-billion buyout.
Enron agreed to sell after its stock plunged 67% in three weeks amid an SEC=
 investigation into partnerships run by Enron executives. Investors worry t=
hat new disclosures, such as previously unreported debt, might threaten Enr=
on's credit rating and scuttle the merger, possibly pushing Enron into bank=
ruptcy.=20
Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay acknowledged last week that failed investments a=

Enron shares fell 48 cents Friday to close at $9 on the New York Stock Exch=

Enron reduced net income for four years by a combined $586 million to inclu=

Today's filing, called a 10-Q, will include a balance sheet summarizing ass=

COMPANIES & FINANCE INTERNATIONAL - Dynegy bid faces long wait.
By NANCY DUNNE and ANDREW HILL.

11/19/2001
Financial Times
(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved

Dynegy's $9.8bn rescue bid for Enron, the larger rival energy group, poses =
complex and unprecedented regulatory challenges for the Federal Energy Regu=
latory Commission (Ferc), which is likely to lead the review of the bid.=20
Officials from the two Houston-based companies, which announced the deal 10=
 days ago, estimated the regulatory process would take six to nine months t=
o complete.
But the Ferc review could take longer, according to experts, and approval o=
f the deal is further complicated by such issues as the parallel Securities=
 and Exchange Commission investigation into Enron's finances.=20
"It's very complicated. It will be very time-consuming," said one person cl=
ose to the Ferc commissioners. As of Friday, the groups had not yet filed f=
or Ferc approval.=20
"(The deal) raises issues that have never been considered before by Ferc," =
said Edward Comer, general counsel to the Edison Electric Institute, the as=
sociation of US electric utilities.=20
"It has never considered the merger of two huge marketers, and in the past,=
 marketing wasn't considered as significant a portion of the energy sector =
as it has become."=20
A typical deal now takes about 200 days to win Ferc approval. But Mr Comer =
said approval of the Dynegy bid could take anywhere from six months to two =
years.=20
The agency's guidelines prohibit mergers if they give the new company the m=
arket power to push prices above competitive levels for "a significant peri=
od of time".=20
It analyses market power by identifying the products sold, the customers an=
d suppliers affected and market concentration.=20
"Mergers in the past have been considered on the basis of assets," said Pat=
ti Harper-Slaboszewicz of Frost & Sullivan, a market research and consultin=
g firm. "The rules were written when the industry was vertically integrated=
."=20
Now the question is how ownership of energy trading services will be calcul=
ated. It could be difficult to assess if the companies are exerting market =
power because information on the trading books of companies such as Enron a=
nd Dynegy is closely guarded, she said.=20
The two companies must also win consent from either the Justice Department =
or the Federal Trade Commission, and from states where the companies have p=
ipelines and provide retail services.=20

Fund Track
Russia Fund Surges Amid Global Woes
By Victoria Marcinkowski
Dow Jones Newswires

The Wall Street Journal
C17

Everything is relative in the investing world, so with U.S. investors nervo=
us about homeland stocks, European and Asian markets sagging and terrorism =
worries abounding, Russia's risky markets seem less so these days.=20
So far this year, Pilgrim Russia Fund, which was bought by ING Groep NV lat=
e last year, has been the top-performing regional mutual fund, gaining 53%,=
 according to fund tracker Morningstar Inc. By comparison, the Standard & P=
oor's 500-stock index has slumped nearly 14%.
Of course, the risks in Russia remain. Despite recent economic gains, the c=
ountry still is struggling with a weak banking system, inadequate state ins=
titutions to enforce contract laws and few businesses run by the "modern" r=
ules of corporate governance, according to Samuel Oubadia the 37-year-old m=
anager of the Russia fund.=20
"But they are getting more open," Mr. Oubadia said, though Russia's lax fin=
ancial reporting standards are still one of the main roadblocks for foreign=
 investors. With $49 million in assets, the Pilgrim Russia fund invests bet=
ween 90% and 95% in Russian stock, with the balance held in cash.=20
"While the global economy is slowing, Russia is still in an expansion mode,=
" Mr. Oubadia said. After years of economic reforms, consumer spending is u=
p 10% and the former Soviet Union's gross domestic product is expected to g=
row 3% to 5% next year, more than twice as much as that of the U.S. and Eur=
ope.=20
Two-thirds of the fund's stocks are oil and gas companies, which are still =
the most liquid stocks in Russia. Utilities, mining, telecommunications com=
panies and breweries make up the rest. "There's no escaping oil and gas if =
you want to manage a Russia fund," Mr. Oubadia said.=20
The spike in oil prices earlier this year made the investment in oil worthw=
hile, propelling earnings growth for Russia's oil and gas companies. Higher=
 oil prices also worked wonders for the Russian economy, which is largely d=
ependent on oil and gas. More recently, however, falling oil prices have th=
reatened the companies' profit growth.=20
But the fund manager, who is based in The Hague, said he doesn't think peop=
le should invest in Russian oil stocks because of their earnings prospects.=
 "You don't invest because of earnings growth -- there will be none for Rus=
sian oil companies this year. You invest because of the stocks' low valuati=
on," Mr. Oubadia said, adding that most of the Russian oil companies still =
trade well below the world-wide average for the sector.=20
Yukos Oil is one of the fund's largest investments, making up about 12% of =
the fund's holdings. Surgutneftegaz and Lukoil Holdings also make up more t=
han 5% each of Pilgrim Russia's assets. While Mr. Oubadia said the companie=
s should be able to handle falling oil prices, partly by cutting production=
, he worries that further price erosion could hamper a fragile Russian stoc=
k market that relies so heavily on oil and gas stocks.=20
"Can Russian markets do well with lower prices for oil?" he asked. "The sho=
rt answer is yes. But how low will prices drop?" Mr. Oubadia acknowledged t=
hat weak oil prices might cause him to shift some investments from oil and =
gas into other Russian sectors, including telecom stocks and consumer produ=
cts.=20
The Russia fund isn't for the timid. In 1998, when the Russian economy coll=
apsed, the fund -- then called Lexington Troika Dialog Russia, lost 83% of =
its value. A year later, the fund soared 160%. In 2000 the fund finished do=
wn almost 18%.=20
---=20
JANUS STOCK SHUFFLE: Janus Capital Corp. bulked up on lower-priced value st=
ocks and shed some shares of its long-held technology companies during the =
third quarter, a new Securities and Exchange Commission filing showed.=20
The Denver fund firm reported that during the third quarter, it lowered its=
 investments in 14 of the 20 largest holdings it had owned as of June 30. T=
he largest reduction was a 43.6 million-share sale of Nokia Corp. stock. Af=
ter the sale, Janus still owned a large 183.2 million-share position in the=
 wireless-phone company at the end of the third quarter.=20
During the quarter, Janus also sold more than half of its stakes in tech co=
mpanies EMC Corp. and Sun Microsystems Inc. In addition, the fund company, =
a unit of Stilwell Financial Inc., trimmed its exposure to energy company E=
nron Corp., selling 1.5 million shares to reduce its overall position to 41=
.4 million shares at the end of September.=20
On the buying side, Janus, one of the hottest fund firms of the late 1990s =
thanks to bets on leading technology stocks, about doubled its position in =
software company Microsoft Corp. It also boosted its holding in the investm=
ent company run by Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., while starting =
a small position in Philip Morris Cos., whose dividend-rich stock is usuall=
y more popular with price-sensitive "value" managers. Janus has introduced =
new value portfolios recently, but most of its investors' assets still foll=

NEW YORK - Companies that trade with Enron Corp., the Houston, Texas-based =
energy group, are taking precautions in case Dynegy Inc., also of Houston, =
withdraws its $15.6-billion rescue bid for its rival, a decision that could=
 trigger a crisis in the energy trading market.=20
Counter-parties to Enron, which is one of the principal market-makers provi=
ding liquidity in the energy market, are seeking to limit their exposure to=
 the group, in spite of reassurances from both Enron and Dynegy that the ta=
keover will go through.
Experts also say the implications of the deal are so complex that the regul=
atory review could take much longer than the six to nine months company off=
icials have estimated.=20
Analysts say the 27% spread between the value of Dynegy's offer price and E=
nron's share price suggests a 65% to 75% chance the bid will succeed. But b=
ankers and energy executives are still worried about systemic risk, both in=
 the energy market and in financial markets, where companies such as Enron =
use derivatives to offset the risk of energy price fluctuations.=20
Enron was close to meltdown until Dynegy stepped in with a rescue bid 10 da=
ys ago, having persuaded credit rating agencies not to downgrade Enron's de=
bt to below investment grade.=20
Clauses built into the merger agreement signed with Enron give Dynegy the r=
ight to walk away under certain circumstances, although the two companies' =
officials and advisors differ on how easy it would be for Dynegy to pull ou=
t.=20
While the situation remains uncertain, companies that deal with Enron are r=

Every foreign company in the Indian power sector wants to exit. Of these, t=

n Orissa is also unhappy. Five years ago, Orissa was the first state to ado=
pt the World Bank-recommended model of separating generation, transmission =
and distribution of power, and an independent regulator. The Godbole Commit=
tee has recently recommended the same for Maharashtra as well.=20
Clearly, separating the three functions is a complex restructuring. Maybe i=
t helps privatisation, the current fashion on the subject having been set i=
n Thatcherite Britain. While some privatisations in UK have succeeded, the =
experience has not been consistent all over.
Take UK's rail sector. While privatising, the government in its wisdom deci=
ded to separate the ownership of the rail network (Railtrack) and the owner=
ship and operation of trains. The contractual relationship between the vari=
ous operating companies and Railtrack were governed by a byzantine, bewilde=
ringly complex system of penalties and incentives, to be monitored by an in=
dependent regulator.=20
Such separation had no parallel. Besides, Railtrack suffered from poor mana=
gement, cost escalation in modernisation of tracks, etc. Several serious ac=
cidents occurred and fixing responsibility became difficult. The "reform" d=
id not work, and Railtrack was put back under public control last month.=20
What are the chances of trifurcation of the power sector in India succeedin=
g? Pretty poor, if the experience of Orissa is any guide. It faithfully sep=
arated the three functions, and privatised distribution and part of generat=
ion. AES, a foreign company, was 49 per cent investor in a generating compa=
ny, and 51 per cent in CESCO, a distribution company. As Gajendra Haldea an=
alysed in this paper on August 27, "The policy and regulatory framework was=
 inadequate and myopic."=20
Distribution losses, a euphemism for power theft, were much larger than the=
 companies had been led to believe at the time of privatisation. CESCO defa=
ulted in paying the dues of GRIDCO, the transmission company, which in turn=
 defaulted to the generating company. Indeed, all CESCO's cash inflows are =
now escrowed, leaving it no money even to pay salaries. For all practical p=
urposes, the distribution companies seem to be in a difficult situation, pe=
rhaps beyond redemption, and the "reform" is a total mess.=20
The crux of the problem in the power sector is not whether a unified SEB is=
 less efficient than trifurcated companies it is the political unwillingnes=
s to charge a price which covers the cost to all consumers. For a while, cr=
oss subsidisation worked with commercial consumers subsidising the househol=
d and the agricultural segments.=20
However, as the burden became too large, the commercial sector started movi=
ng to captive generation, further worsening SEB finances. An "independent" =
regulator for power tariffs may not solve the problem. He may fix economic =
prices but will the state come forward to protect the bill collectors, puni=
sh power thiefs, face social unrest if power to recalcitrant consumers is c=
ut off? So long as the answers to these questions are in the negative, as, =
sadly, they are, the institutional restructuring is no substitute for subst=
antive action. No wonder all foreign investors in the power sector want to =
get out!=20
Enron too wants out but it has many more problems in its home country, over=
 and above its dispute with MSEB. It had attracted a lot of adverse publici=
ty for gouging power consumers in California, a state in a power crisis (se=
e World Money, February 2, 2001). The Internet craze also had a hand in Enr=
on's misfortunes. It became an energy trader, established an electronic tra=
ding platform, had broadband ambitions, went into a disastrous diversificat=
ion in water supplies which, if I remember correctly, led to Rebecca Mark's=
 exit. Perhaps it went into too many areas too quickly under Jeffery Skilli=
ng, ex-McKinsey, and was notorious for opaque, complex accounts.=20
To top it all, last month it announced that it will take an extraordinary $=
1.2 billion charge in its third quarter results for losses in financial act=
ivities. Enron's chief financial officer, who was supposed to be in charge =
of these, has resigned amidst reports that a private equity fund associated=
 with him was involved in them. The SEC is investigating the affair and Enr=
on's share price is down 67 per cent since mid-October. There are some repo=
rts that Shell may make a bid for Enron.=20
After its ratings were downgraded, Enron is desperate for liquidity and anx=
ious to dispose its assets. DPCL was already on the platter; now a sale has=
 become even more urgent. Reportedly, Tatas and BSES are interested; so are=
 the lending institutions. Clearly, if a settlement is to be reached, this =
is the optimum time.=20
But one is not very optimistic. For one, Delhi and Mumbai will be involved,=
 and bureaucracies never understand opportunity costs. Our byzantine decisi=
on-making processes make timely decisions impossible. Further, if a deal do=
es take place, there will be the inevitable allegations of corruption. It i=
s much safer for the reputation of the concerned ministers in Mumbai and De=
lhi to allow the drift to continue, to "let the law take its own course", w=
hatever the costs! Sadly, as Jairam Ramesh said in this paper, Indian polit=
icians respond to developments only out of compulsion, not conviction.

Greg, David,

While I think you guys have come to some conclusions about layoffs, it is the people we need to keep we need to address now.  We will provide you a list of those that are crucial to keep going forward.

I am extremely concerned about one person in particular--Rob Fuller.  I have done everything I can over the last weeks to make sure he knows we are committed to him, however market rumors are that he could be close to leaving.  We now have to commit to him with dollars on a piece of paper, and any help you can provide tomorrow would be helpful.  I don't think this is a next week issue.

Shanna, I will coordinate with you on the HR front to get Oxley's feedback.

Thanks for your attention.

Jeff

Enron Global Markets Competitive Analysis
JAPAN UPDATE: 9/25/01

Risks Increase for Longer, Deeper Deflationary Recession If Current Policy =
Mix Muddle Remains, NPLs Unresolved


SUMMARY:

Deflationary Recession: Japan, apart from the raft of new and compounded di=
fficulties consequent of September 11, was already facing a very difficult =
end of fiscal half-year and confirmation of another recession
After September 11: The impact of the shock to the world system over the pa=
st two weeks has reinforced - from outside - the structural challenges faci=
ng the domestic system
Yen Strength Despite Intervention: Recent efforts to stem rise of Yen, enla=
rge supplementary budget, reinforce the continuing reactive basis of policy=
-making in Japan, leadership challenges
Koizumi Still Enjoying Support, Keeping LDP Afloat: Cabinet's approval rati=
ng is 79%, with the LDP's approval at a 9-year high of 51%
Signs of Life: Bankruptcies down and retail sales component rises; as in th=
e US, consumer behavior will drive outcomes
Surrounding Asia: Weakens further on concerns about risk aversion relative =
to emerging markets and depressed export outlook
Collateral Effects: US weakness reinforces trend toward coincident global r=
ecession
NPL Update: Still Vague: Koizumi finally releases basis for expanded RCC ro=
le in settling NPLs


REPORT:

Global Context
Japan's greatest challenge is coming from the coincidence of recession, def=
lation, high government debt stock, and, for the first time, sustained eros=
ion of export surpluses and flight of manufacturing outside of Japan for ex=
port to Japan.  Part of the latest reductions in the world growth outlook a=
nd the related decline in world equities are due to the September 11 traged=
y and its many human and economic consequences. This portion of the equity =
market losses will be hard to recover. Another part of the post-tragedy dec=
line is a delayed reaction to the global deflation and recession which were=
 deepening prior to September 11. (Economic data since September 11 provide=
d firm evidence of sharply weakening economies in the U.S. and Europe.  Equ=
ities would probably have declined even without the tragedy.) This part of =
the recent equity loss argues for policy changes to stop the global slowdow=
n.  The challenge, as described in previous reports, comes from differing p=
riorities and magnitudes of responses across major economies to a global cy=
cle downturn. =20

Koizumi v. MoF
The Japanese government reportedly signaled some flexibility in its fiscal =
stance:  Koizumi said he may have to take a "flexible approach" to the Y30 =
trillion cap on new JGB issuance; but Shiokawa said the government's plan t=
o keep new JGB issuance below Y30 trillion was unchanged.  The government i=
s considering issuing up to Y5 trillion 10-year or shorter maturity "Koizum=
i bonds", funded by the sale of national assets as well as funds arising fr=
om administrative reforms (not included in the Y30 trillion cap).

BoJ
The central bank has shown no inclination to use monetary policy stimulus t=
o stop the recession. Instead, it continues to pursue fiscal stimulus and s=
tructural reforms, policy steps are seen by several sources as actually dee=
pening the recession. Though nominal interest rates are at zero, real inter=
est rates are very high. The central bank provides Y6 trillion in excess li=
quidity to the commercial banking sector, but the funds are very short term=
 and have not penetrated into the economy.

NPLs
Event: Koizumi administration officials released the program for expanding =
the Resolution Credit Corp's role in settling the NPL problem.  Because of =
still unsettled battles between FSA leader Yanagisawa and other Koizumi adv=
isors, the details of this plan were still left vague.  Yanagisawa is invol=
ved in a two-front war, pinned between officials on one side who want to ba=
nkrupt the 20-30 top debtor companies immediately, and BOJ officials on the=
 other side, who want to fund the RCC much more aggressively through buying=
 specially issued RCC bonds to let the institution expand its purchases of =
bad debt.

Result: What has been decided is to have the RCC dramatically change the pr=
ice at which they will purchase assets from banks and to expand its ability=
 to make losses when it sells those assets. This is an "in principle" decis=
ion and the fights rage on about exactly what this new freedom should mean.=
 Yanagisawa hopes to combine more activity on this front with his main idea=
 of re-examining 'need-attention' loans (with help from market signals like=
 the price of company stock, etc. detailed in our previous reports). Yanagi=
sawa would create a new class for these loans and then require banks to rai=
se the reserves they hold against these loans.=20

Strategy: Using the RCC is seen as an alternative to direct capital injecti=
on.  As one senior advisor put it, "It's not just that Yanagisawa wants to =
avoid capital injection because he'd be blamed for the failure of his first=
 injection. It's because capital injection (into "healthy" banks) doesn't w=
ork. We can't really force them to change management and to improve perform=
ance. There's a sense at FSA and the government generally that bankers are =
lousy and they'll never improve. Banks....are very unpopular. Providing cap=
ital to RCC is less obviously a direct help to the banks. That explains som=
e of the interest on the part of politicians." And it explains why this wil=
l be part of the eventual solution.

BOJ's Interest: BoJ is interested in funding this RCC because it allows the=
m to be part of the solution without adopting inflation targets or directly=
 purchasing JGBs. Assuming the RCC will be financed through issue of govern=
ment-guaranteed bonds, the BOJ would be happy to buy them as long as they w=
ere guaranteed (but not issued by) the Japanese government. BoJ does not wa=
nt to directly underwrite bonds issued by RCC because that would be against=
 the law (conveniently) and RCC would have a low rating. It's also true tha=
t BOJ likes the RCC idea better than going through the process of tighter a=
ssessment, bankruptcies, and capital injection, because it cleans up the ba=
nks' books in one swoop.

FSA's Concern: FSA official's comment: "There is a real problem in everybod=
y pretending that the problem will be solved by taking all the bad loans to=
 RCC. No matter how much money it gets, the RCC simply doesn't have the cap=
acity to help reconstruct companies. Maybe it can farm out this work to tho=
se who do. But the most likely outcome is that it will just give up and res=
ell everything at market price. This would mean that a lot of companies, in=
cluding those which may be saved, will go bankrupt. There are social and ec=
onomic consequences - it will be very deflationary. The banks will be a lot=
 better off but industry will be in a bad way. That's why we have to take s=
ome more time and figure out how much of this can be done through the RCC a=
nd how much through better reserving for special attention NPLs."=20

Koizumi Advisor's Assessment: One of Koizumi's advisors, looking over the s=
tate of play and admitting all of the hesitation that FSA officials feel, s=
ays, "There is no doubt that we still have lots of stuff to be worked out. =
But as I see it, we now have vague outlines of NPL disposal. In addition, t=
he FSA now admits that it has to get tighter: i.e., it has to get to the 'n=
eed attention' loans and look at them more carefully, reclassify the bad pa=
rts of need attention loans, and those additional downgraded loans will hav=
e to be disposed of in the 2-3 year framework. In other words, the Y13 tril=
lion total will go up significantly. We will give banks a break through the=
 use of something significantly above market price in selling NPLs to RCC. =
But the most fundamental thing still to be understood is that the RCC will =
have to acquire reconstruction skills or buy them if the companies sold to =
RCC are to have a fair chance of recovery."

I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

Enron Fights To Find Near-Term Sellers,But Still Trading
By Mark Golden
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/27/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) continued to struggle Tuesday to find willing sellers of near-term gas and power in North America, but the one-time market maker was still able to trade on a limited basis, according to market sources. 
"It's not getting any better," said one major energy broker.
Many energy trading companies aren't selling to Enron and are only buying from it near-term. These include Aquila Inc. (ILA), Mirant (MIR), Royal Dutch/Shell Group (RD) subsidiary Coral Energy, Sempra Energy (SRE), and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's energy trading subsidiary, said the broker. The broker estimated Enron's over-the-counter trading volume to be about 25% of what it was a month ago. Companies are willing to buy from Enron in the spot gas and power markets, because taking delivery on commodity and paying for it a month later poses no credit risk for the buyer. 
Some other companies, like Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) and BP PLC. (BP), continue to trade with Enron fairly freely, the broker said. Dynegy has reached an agreement to acquire Enron, though the terms of that deal are being renegotiated. The trading subsidiaries of troubled California utility-holding companies PG&E Corp. (PCG) and Edison International (EIX) also are trading with Enron. 
The third and largest group of companies are trading with Enron on a very limited basis to reduce exposure by taking off-setting trades against deals done long ago. These include El Paso Corp. (EPG), Reliant Resources (RRI), Tractebel SA's (B.TRB) U.S. trading unit and regulated utilities, the broker said. 
Several energy traders said that both power and gas were being sold at prices lower than Enron was offering. 
"They've been cut off from so many people," said one electricity trader. 
Enron Says Just Slight Reduction In Transactions 

An Enron spokesman said he has seen a slight reduction in transactions but not to 25% of the one-month-ago level. 
The notional value of Enron's 30-day rolling average of transactions is $2.8 billion, said Enron spokesman Eric Thode. Thode declined to give volume data for Tuesday or Monday, although the company was giving daily information two weeks ago. 
"We're not doing daily information. We're only speaking in terms of 30-day rolling averages. ... It's not fair to speak in terms of daily because of daily volatility," Thode said. 
Traders and brokers said they hope Dynegy will offer some kind of guarantee to Enron's trading to restore confidence. But, after Enron's ability to transact took a severe turn for the worse Nov. 20, Dynegy said that the companies must continue to operate independently until their merger is approved and completed. 
Energy companies began shying away from Enron over the past month, as concerns about its finances precipitated a 75% drop in its stock price and left its bonds trading at levels typically associated with junk-rated debt. 
But Enron saw its ability to trade seriously damaged last week following the late release of its quarterly financial report with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission. For the first time since Enron's troubles began a month ago, energy companies stopped selling to Enron in the spot markets for fear that Enron might not be able to pay its bills as soon as next month based on the quarterly filing. 
Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's all rate Enron one notch above speculative grade. Moody's has Enron's ratings on review for a downgrade, and S&P has Enron on negative credit watch. Fitch calls Enron's credit rating "evolving." Enron's ability to do business in the energy markets depends on its maintaining investment-grade ratings.

USA: UPDATE 3-Dynegy says in talks on Enron merger structure.
By C. Bryson Hull

11/27/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
HOUSTON, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Energy trader Dynegy Inc. confirmed on Tuesday it was in talks with floundering rival Enron Corp. over their proposed merger, as sources familiar with the negotiations indicated the final buyout price may be slashed some 40 percent. 
"I can confirm that we are in discussions with the parties involved in the transaction related to the deal," Dynegy spokesman John Sousa told Reuters. He declined to give further details.
Dynegy had planned to buy its Houston rival for $9 billion in stock and is currently in a "due diligence" examination of Enron's complex financial books that began before the Thanksgiving holiday last Thursday. 
The buyout offer, finalized Nov. 9, would have had Dynegy paying about $10.41 for each share of Enron, but Enron's shares have since cratered to near $4, stoking investor fears the merger will not go through as planned - if at all. 
The stock exchange ratio under discussion could fall from the originally proposed valuation of 0.2685 of each Dynegy share for each Enron share to around 0.15 instead, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Enron is willing to accept the lower valuation, given the pressure on its stock price, the sources said. 
Enron's shares bounced on Dynegy's confirmation of the restructuring talks, trading up 22 cents at $4.23 in late afternoon action on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares had dipped as low as $3.84 in late-morning dealings and as high $4.49. Dynegy's shares gained 4.7 percent or $1.83 to move to $41.08 on the NYSE. 
Also on the table were negotiations to extend maturation of Enron's debt past the close of the merger, expected in the third quarter of 2002. The sources said an announcement was possible on a new infusion of at least $500 million in cash, which Enron has said it was seeking. 
There also seemed to be an accord over who gets first crack at the Northern Natural Gas Pipeline, which would be Dynegy's consolation prize if the deal fell apart, a source said. Published reports have said that investment banks J.P. Morgan and Salomon Smith Barney had already accepted the pipeline as collateral in other loans, and may dispute Dynegy's ownership if the deal breaks up. 
"The pipeline is far more valuable than what has already been collateralized. There's a solid earnings stream from that thing," said one source familiar with the discussions. 
ONE TRADING UNIT SHUT DOWN 
Two sources confirmed to Reuters that Enron's equity trading unit has been told it is being closed and that the roughly 60 employees there are being laid off. Enron was not immediately available for comment. 
Those layoffs, part of broader job cuts expected as part of the Dynegy buyout, point to an acute problem for Enron - the loss of volume in its premier trading franchise. Enron's trading partners have been cutting back transactions with North America's largest energy trader because of credit concerns. 
"This business is hugely dependent on volumes and volume growth. It is the principal reason that Dynegy is making the deal. If it's worth a lot less then Enron is worth less. It's vital to stop the bleeding in its core trading and marketing business," said Commerzbank analyst Andre Meade. 
But as Enron's stock continued to lose value, down over 50 percent since Dynegy's initial bid, it seemed likely the purchase price would fall as well. Enron has seen its market capitalization drop to around $3 billion, from $60 billion at the start of 2001. (additional reporting by Jeff Goldfarb, Janet McGurty and Jonathan Stempel in New York).

NEW YORK (AFX0 - Dynegy Inc confirmed it is in talks with Enron Corp on the terms of their two week-old acquisition deal.
"I can confirm that we are in discussions with the parties involved in the transaction related to the structure of a deal," Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel said. 
Enron declined to comment. 
Citing people familiar with the matter, the Wall Street Journal reported today that Enron is in advanced talks with Dynegy to cut the price of the all-stock transaction by more than 40 pct to about 5 bln usd. 
Enron is also trying to extend the maturity dates of some of its borrowings to stem a growing liquidity crisis, the Wall Street Journal said.

Merger Traders Wary Even If Enron, Dynegy Cut New Terms
By Christina Cheddar
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/27/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Even if Dynegy Inc. (DYN) revises the terms of its acquisition of Enron Corp. (ENE), some takeover traders say the stock remains too risky. 
Earlier Tuesday, a Dynegy spokesman confirmed the company was in talks to restructure the Enron acquisition. Separately, a person familiar with the negotiations said the talks are centered on creating a package that includes a lower exchange ratio for Enron shareholders, a provision for additional funding for Enron, and the refinancing of Enron's existing debt.
Even with the boost Enron shares have received from the reports, they continue to trade at a sharp discount to the original deal's value. Enron shares recently traded at $4.30, up 29 cents, or 7.2%, while Dynegy shares changed hands at $41.50, up $2.25, or 5.8%. 
Under the original terms of the deal, Enron shareholders will receive 0.2685 of a Dynegy for each share outstanding, or $9.47 billion. At current trading levels, Enron shares are at a 61% discount to the offer price. 
According to The Wall Street Journal, Dynegy and Enron are contemplating an exchange ratio of less than 0.15 of a Dynegy share, or about $5.29 billion. 
The rejiggered deal is an attempt to restore confidence in Enron's ability to carry on its core energy marketing and trading business as the deal moves toward completion, the person said. 
As the market waits for more details from the two companies, some say it will take more than a revised offer to provide takeover traders, also known as arbitrageurs, with enough confidence to play the deal in the typical fashion. 
Often arbitrageurs bet on pending mergers by selling short shares of the acquiring company and buying shares of the target. In this way, the traders hope to profit as the target's share price moves toward the buyer's offer. 
But according to some traders, there is too much risk, even for those accustomed to uncertainty, to play the Dynegy-Enron deal in this way. 
Several traders said they were still wary that the deal could collapse and potentially push Enron into bankruptcy. 
Enron's fortunes took a sharp turn for the worst after investors began to realize the company liberally used accounting loopholes to move its debts into off-balance-sheet financing vehicles, including partnerships run by its former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. 
"There's nothing like accounting to scare people," said one trader, who said there is still a perception in the market that there is more bad news yet to come from Enron.

NEW YORK (AFX0 - Dynegy Inc confirmed it is in talks with Enron Corp to renegotiate the terms of a deal with Dynegy Inc in an attempt to save their two week-old acquisition deal. 
"I can confirm that we are in discussions with the parties involved in the transaction related to the structure of a deal," Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel said.
Enron, meanwhile, declined to comment on the report. 
Citing people familiar with the matter, the Wall Street Journal reported that Enron Corp is in advanced talks with Dynegy to cut the price of the all-stock transaction by more than 40 pct to about 5 bln usd. 
Enron is also trying to extend the maturity dates of some of its borrowings to stem a growing liquidity crisis, the Wall Street Journal said.

STOCKWATCH Enron slightly higher on hopes for new deal price

11/27/2001

(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd
NEW YORK (AFX) - Shares of Enron Corp were slightly higher in midsession trade on reports that the company is trying to renegotiate the terms of a deal with Dynegy Inc, by cutting the price of the all-stock transaction to 5 bln usd, or 40 pct, from 9 bln usd, dealers said. 
At 12.19 pm, amid broad declines in the market, Enron shares were trading up 5 cents at 4.04 usd. Dynegy was up 1.26 usd, or 3.26 pct, at 40.51.
The DJIA was down 111.48 points at 9,871.28. The S&P 500 was down 10.40 points at 1,147.02. The Nasdaq composite was down 20.25 points at 1,920.98. 
Earlier, the Wall Street Journal said Enron was in advanced talks with Dynegy in an attempt to salvage their two week-old acquisition deal. The companies are discussing a new price for the all-paper deal, following the sharp fall in Enron's share price of the past few weeks. 
Enron had hoped to finalise the deal and make an announcement yesterday that would calm investors -- the shares are trading at a small fraction of their record high last year of 87.50 usd. 
As of today, however, the revised deal still has not been formalised. 
The current agreement with Dynegy contains a "material adverse change" clause, which could be invoked to call the deal off. 
As part of its due diligence, Dynegy is examining details of Enron's filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week, which reportedly contained information it had not received previously. 
"Enron is a black hole, and I don't know how deep the bottom is," said Fadel Gheit an analyst at Fahnestock & Co. 
Only four weeks ago, Enron's stock was trading at the 8 usd mark, Gheit said, noting that if the Dynegy had done their homework the stock would not have continued to collapse. 
"The market sees this and somebody has to figure out the potential exposure, it could be several billion dollars," said Gheit. 
If the deal is to go through then the two companies must arrive at a new stock-exchange ratio, said Gheit. Under the current acquisition agreement, Dynegy would exchange 0.2685 share for each Enron share tendered. 
According to the Wall Street Journal, the new ratio is expected to be less than 0.15 share of Dynegy stock for every share of Enron stock, which would value Enron at less than 6 usd a share, or about 5 bln usd.

IN THE MONEY: Hedge Funds Say Yes To New Enron Terms
By Carol S. Remond

11/27/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- News that Enron Corp. (ENE) and would-be suitor and savior Dynegy Inc. (DYN) are working to renegotiate their merger agreement has done little to assuage market jitters about Enron's fate.
And so far, even professional arbitrageurs, who normally thrive on placing bets on whether a merger is going to go through, continue for the most part to stay clear of Enron's stock and bonds because of the uncertainty surrounding the once mighty energy trader. 
Still, reports that the equity swap ratio offered by Dynegy could be revised down to below 0.15 from 0.2685, has some hedge funds, often willing to take more risks, looking to place trades on the deal. 
"We're trying to figure out a good play," said a trader at a New York hedge fund. 
So far, bets under consideration seem to be those that would include a combination of stock and debt trading, somehow hedging a short position on Enron's shares with a long position in some of its bonds. 
"People that are playing the debt are definitely playing the stock against it," a hedge fund manager at another fund said. This manager added, "We're still trying to evaluate different risk/reward scenario on the debt and equity sides." 
Investors that sell stock short borrow shares in the hopes of replacing them later by purchasing them at a lower price. 
Arbitrageurs typically sell short shares of the acquirer, while taking long positions in the stock of the target company. But there is nothing typical about Enron's financial woes and the rescue efforts launched by Dynegy and large banks like J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. 
Traders reported increased activity in the still mostly illiquid Enron debt market. "Some bids are coming in, especially on the lower priced bonds," said a trader at a large New York investment bank that makes a market in Enron's bonds. 
Enron bonds, which had fallen in value in recent weeks, gained five to seven points early Tuesday as investors continue to await confirmation from Enron and Dynegy that their merger deal remains on track, albeit at a lower price. Enron's 6.4% bonds due 2004 were recently trading at about 55 cents on the dollar, up from 48 cents Monday. 
Under the original terms of the deal, Enron holders would have gotten 0.2685 of Dynegy shares for each of their Enron shares. Quoting people close to the discussions, The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that the new ratio is expected to be less than 0.15 share of Dynegy stock for every share of Enron stock. That lower exchange was also mentioned in a Dow Jones Newswires story last Friday. At current prices a 0.15 exchange ratio would value Enron at less than $6 a share. 
Essentially this new value, if true, means that it has now become easier for hedge funds and other risk takers to play the merger odds. 
When a hedge fund shorting Enron stock at $4 a share risked losing more than $6 if the merger went through at the 0.2685 ratio, it now stands to lose only $2 a share (based on the $6 value of Enron stock under the new 0.15 ratio). At the same time it has become much easier to hedge that loss potential by going long on Enron bonds. If the merger doesn't happen, Enron is seen by many as heading for bankruptcy with an ultimate share value of 0. That means that hedge funds shorting Enron at $4 stand to benefit by that amount. 
Hedge fund managers and traders said that current thinking puts the value of Enron bonds at about 20 cents on the dollar if the merger fails and about 80 cents on the dollar if it goes through. Meanwhile, the value of Enron stock is capped at about $6 a share if the merger goes through with a new conversion ratio of 0.15. 
"A lot of the guys are still very skeptical," said a bond trader at a New York bank. "But this is really making the hedge trade easier and we've seen more customers short the stock and buy the bonds." 
Still, this type of bets isn't for the faint of heart, and most investors are likely to wait for more news before taking a position. 
"We're nibbling a little bit at the bonds right now. But the situation is so volatile that it's difficult to be aggressive," the manager of a large New York hedge fund said.

Dynegy Confirms Talks On Enron Deal Structure - Source
By Christina Cheddar
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/27/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Dynegy Inc. (DYN) confirmed the company is in talks with a number of parties regarding the structure of its transaction with Enron Corp. (ENE). 
"I can confirm that we are in discussions with the parties involved in the transaction related to the structure of the deal," said John Sousa. "I can't elaborate any further at this time."
An Enron official wasn't immediately to comment. 

Earlier Tuesday, a report in The Wall Street Journal quoted people familiar with the matter who said Enron and Dynegy were in advanced discussions to cut the price of the all-stock transaction by more than 40% to about $5 billion. Sousa, the Dynegy spokesman, didn't comment on the newspaper report. 
Dynegy shares recently traded at $40, up 75 cents, or 1.9%, while Enron shares changed hands at $3.94, down 7 cents, or 1.7%. 
Under the original terms of the transaction, Enron shareholders are to receive 0.2685 of a Dynegy share, or $10.78, for each share outstanding, or about $9.14 billion, based on Dynegy's recent stock price. 
According to the Journal report, the new terms could be below 0.15 of a Dynegy share. 
The deal is critical for Enron, which also simultaneously carrying out talks to receive between $500 million to $1 billion in additional funding to support its operations, while carrying on negotiations to restructure its debt, which totals about $13 billion. 
While Dynegy has already provided Enron with a cash infusion, it is uncertain how long Enron's current funds will allow it to remain solvent. 
Meanwhile, a third employee lawsuit has been filed against Enron over lost 401(k) retirement savings due to the recent collapse of Enron's stock, which has declined more than 90% in the trailing 12 months. The suit claims Enron "locked down" the plan, which prevented employees from being able to sell the shares, and seeks $850 million for plan losses. 
Although the other recently filed employee suits didn't disclose the amount of compensation the plaintiffs are seeking, it is possible the suits seek a similar level of damages, a CreditSights report said. 
If this is true, the CreditSights report said, it is possible the clause that allows Dynegy to walk away from the deal if the liabilities from "pending"' or "threatened" litigation may exceed $3.5 billion may be invoked. 
In addition, to the employee lawsuits, more than a dozen shareholder suits have been filed against Enron.

The discussions between Enron and Dynegy aren't merely focused on revising the consideration Dynegy will pay. They are also aimed at providing Enron with additional funding and at restructuring its debt, said a person familiar with the negotiations. 
The moves are aimed at restoring confidence in Enron and relieving "the perceived liquidity crisis," the source said.

NEW YORK, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Shares of financially troubled energy trading giant Enron Corp. slipped back into the red on Tuesday after gaining in opening trade following news of a new rescue deal from Dynegy Inc. . 
Enron shares were down 2 cents at $3.99 after rising 19 cents, or 4.7 percent, to $4.20 in early dealings on the New York Stock Exchange.
Analysts questioned the viability of the original proposal for Dynegy to acquire Enron in a deal worth about $9 billion. 
The Wall Street Journal reported that the companies were discussing reducing the price of the all-stock deal by more than 40 percent, to about $5 billion.

Enron Credit Rating to Remain Unchanged for Today, Moody's Says
2001-11-27 16:12 (New York)

Enron Credit Rating to Remain Unchanged for Today, Moody's Says

     New York, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s credit rating
will remain at ``Baa3,'' the lowest investment grade, by Moody's
Investors Service, which said it won't take any ratings action
today on the largest energy trading company.

     David Stimpson, Moody's managing director for ratings
communication, said although there was speculation in the market
that Moody's would make a ratings change, the company won't take
any action on Enron today. Stimpson declined further comment.

     Moody's had been expected to make a statement on Enron's
credit as bankers sought to raise as much as $2 billion for the
energy trader in private equity.

     Bankers led by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Vice Chairman James B.
Lee have been unable for two weeks to raise the money because of
concern Enron won't be able to meet its obligations. That concern
was heightened after Enron disclosed a $690 million payment due
this week. Enron needs the money to operate as it completes an
acquisition by Dynegy Inc.



Enron Turned Down by Investors Alwaleed, Blackstone, Carlyle
2001-11-27 15:16 (New York)

Enron Turned Down by Investors Alwaleed, Blackstone, Carlyle

     New York, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s bankers,
seeking to raise as much as $2 billion for the energy trader, have
been turned down by investors including Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal,
the Carlyle Group Inc. and Blackstone Group LP.

     ``I was approached by several people to invest in the
company, but we declined,'' said Alwaleed, a billionaire investor
from Saudi Arabia. The fall in Enron's shares, which have declined
95 percent this year, didn't necessarily make it a good
investment, he said.

     Bankers led by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Vice Chairman James B.
Lee have been unable for two weeks to raise the money because of
concern Enron won't be able to meet its obligations. That concern
was heightened after Enron disclosed a $690 million payment due
this week. Enron needs the money to operate as it completes an
acquisition by Dynegy Inc.

     The prospect that Enron will fail to line up financing,
jeopardizing its plan to be acquired by Dynegy, has weighed on its
stock and bonds. The company's securities gained today as talks
between Enron and Dynegy to renegotiate terms of the transaction
convinced some investors the takeover was more likely to take
place.

     Enron 6.4 percent bonds that mature in 2006, which closed
yesterday at 48 cents on the dollar, rebounded to trade at about
55 cents on the dollar. At that price, the bonds yield 22.5
percent. Enron shares rose 21 cents, or 5 percent, to $4.22. The
stock finished yesterday at $4.01, its lowest level in 14 years.

                        Declining to Invest

     J.P. Morgan and Citigroup Inc., Enron's largest lenders, plan
to provide $250 million to Enron each as part of a $2 billion
package. The bankers have been seeking additional investments,
which would be made in the form of convertible stock, for more
than two weeks.

     Questor Management Co., a $1 billion private-equity fund that
invests in troubled companies, and buyout funds such as Carlyle
Group and Blackstone have balked at investing, said people
familiar with the situation. Blackstone and Questor declined to
comment. Christopher Ullman, a spokesman for Carlyle, said: ``We
are not in discussions with Enron about financing.''

   ``More equity would leave Enron with a stronger balance sheet,
which should reassure their trading partners,'' said Kathleen
Vuchetich, who helps manage $1.4 billion in assets at the Strong
American Utilities Fund. Vuchetich has 4.2 percent of her
portfolio invested in Dynegy shares.

     Enron and Dynegy discussed revising the terms of their merger
over the weekend, said Steve Stengel, spokesman for Dynegy. Dynegy
is now talking about paying less than 0.15 share for each of
Enron's, valuing the company's equity at about $5 billion, or less
than $6 per share, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people
close to the discussions.

                               Terms

     ``The concern is that the Dynegy deal breaks down,'' said
Paul Tice, co-head of U.S. high-grade credit research who covers
the energy market for Deutsche Bank.

     Current terms call for an exchange ratio of 0.2685 share of
Dynegy stock for each Enron share. Given recent disclosures about
Enron's debt and the drop in the stock price, a fairer ratio would
be 0.15 share of Dynegy, said Ronald Barone, a UBS Warburg analyst
who rates Dynegy a ``strong buy.''

    Under current terms, the deal makes sense for Dynegy only if
Enron earns 85 cents or more next year, said Gordon Howald, an
analyst at Credit Lyonnais who rates Dynegy a ``buy.'' UBS
Warburg's Barone has reduced his estimate of Enron's 2002 earnings
to 75 cents a share from $1.65.

     Enron needs an infusion in part because it has $9 billion of
payments due before the end of 2002 and less than $2 billion in
cash and credit lines. The decline in reserves has also raised the
prospect that Moody's Investors Service may cut Enron's credit
rating. A lower rating would trigger $3.9 billion in debt
repayments for two affiliated partnerships.

                           Cash Question

     ``The main question is: `What is the cash position right
now?''' said Tice at Deutsche Bank. ``Is the falloff in the cash
position of the company stabilizing or not?''

     Moody's hasn't issued a report on Enron since the company
filed a quarterly report with the Securities and Exchange
Commission last week announcing it had a $690 million note due
this week. On Wednesday, Enron got a three-week reprieve from
lenders on the $690 million note and closed on a $450 million
credit line. Dynegy Chief Executive Officer Chuck Watson said he
was ``encouraged'' by the developments.



Liberty Funds Analyst Paik Comments on Dynegy and Enron Talks
2001-11-27 11:56 (New York)


     Boston, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Edward Paik, an analyst at
Liberty Funds Group, comments on Dynegy Inc.'s proposed
$23 billion acquisition of Enron Corp., the largest energy trader.

     Paik has Enron shares among the $3.6 billion in assets he
helps manage at Liberty.

     Dynegy may renegotiate terms of its bid for Enron, people
familiar with talks between the Houston-based companies said
yesterday.

     ``The stock market is clearly 100 percent certain the Dynegy
deal won't go through as negotiated,'' Paik said. ``We're just
waiting.''

     ``If they announce they've renegotiated the deal, it will be
implicit that due diligence has been done, and that Dynegy won't
walk away for anything that's happened up until now. If they were
to impose more conditions, what good is that? Dynegy needs to
resuscitate Enron back to health.''



A.G. Edwards Analyst Heim Comments on Dynegy and Enron Talks
2001-11-27 11:00 (New York)


     St. Louis, Missouri, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- A.G. Edwards &
Sons Inc. analyst Michael Heim comments on Dynegy Inc.'s proposed
$23 billion buyout of Enron Corp., the largest energy trader.

     Dynegy may renegotiate terms of its bid for Enron, people
familiar with talks between the Houston-based companies said
yesterday. Heim rates Enron ``sell'' and Dynegy ``hold'' and
doesn't own shares of either company.

     The market is waiting for confirmation and details of a
renegotiated bid, Heim said.

     ``We'd need to know why they'd agreed to a new price,'' Heim
said. ``It also needs to be combined with some sort of shoring up
of Enron's trading business, which needs to be stabilized for the
deal to have real value.''



Commerzbank Analyst Meade Comments on Dynegy's Talks With Enron
2001-11-27 10:42 (New York)


     New York, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Commerzbank Securities
analyst Andre Meade comments on Dynegy Inc.'s proposed
$23 billion buyout of Enron Corp., the largest energy trader.

     Dynegy may renegotiate terms of its bid for Enron, people
familiar with talks between the Houston-based companies said
yesterday. Meade rates both companies ``hold'' and owns no shares.

     ``If they are renegotiating, it confirms our fears that
Enron's crown jewel, its marketing and trading business, is
deteriorating,''

      Investors are waiting for a sign on the state of the
business, Meade said.

      Enron's trading business was worth more than $10 billion
before partners began shunning it on credit concerns, Meade said.
A lower price struck by Dynegy may reveal how much business has
fallen, and whether Dynegy believes Enron can regain it, Meade
said.

     A New York Times report that banks may extend payments on
some loans until after Dynegy purchases Enron ``raises concern
that Dynegy will be hurt by taking on the vast liabilities of
Enron,'' Meade said.





ENRON SHARES RECOVER FROM A.M. SLUMP
By Lisa Sanders
CBS.MarketWatch.com

4:10 PM ET Nov 27, 2001

HOUSTON (CBS.MW) -- Shares of Enron recovered from the morning's sub-$4
a share level Tuesday amid reports that the embattled energy merchant is
working with Dynegy to renegotiate its takeover offer.


Enron (ENE), which once hit $84.88 during the last holiday season,
added 13 cents to close at $4.14 on volume of 68.4 million shares. The
stock was the most actively traded on the New York Stock Exchange
Tuesday.

Dynegy shares added $1.64 to close at $40.89.

The New York Times reported that Houston-based Dynegy (DYN) and Enron
are renegotiating Dynegy's bid, once valued at $9 billion in stock.
According to the report, Dynegy is worried that Enron's core business --
energy trading -- is deteriorating. See full story.



Getting it done

_______________________________________________________________________

Glen Hilton, portfolio manager of the Montgomery New Power Fund, said
it's a "crapshoot" as to whether the deal gets done.

"I think that regardless of the outcome Dynegy is still in a good
position for the long-term," he said. His fund liquidated its Enron
holdings completely in mid to late-October. "Enron was the leader (in
energy trading), and it's clearly suffering so Dynegy is in a good shot
to take up the mantle."

Hilton pointed to Enron's 10-Q, filed last Monday with the Securities
and Exchange Commission, and the falling share price as potential
triggers of the deal's material adverse affect clause. Those two things
could very well make Dynegy walk away from the merger. If that happens,
Hilton said, an Enron bankruptcy is a very real possibility.

"Very few companies understand what Enron does and Dynegy is one of the
few that could make something out of it," Hilton said. "If Dynegy can
restore confidence in Enron's trading business and get Northern Natural
Gas, it looks like it might be worth the headache."

Dynegy has the rights to Enron's Northern Natural Gas, a pipeline
system, whether the merger goes through or not.

Enron wasn't immediately available for comment. Dynegy, through a
company spokesman, confirmed that it was in discussions with "the
parties involved in the transaction" related to the structure of the
deal.



Top Of The News 
Enron In Free Fall 
Dan Ackman <javascript:newWindow('Ackman')>, Forbes.com <http://www.forbes.com/news>, 11.27.01, 9:00 AM ET 

NEW YORK - If not for Sept. 11, Enron would be a major scandal; as it stands, it's a minor scandal. The Houston-based energy company, whose Chairman Kenneth Lay is a personal friend of and top fundraiser for President George W. Bush <http://www.forbes.com/2001/10/12/gwbush.html> and Vice President Dick Cheney, is in free fall. The bailout by rival Dynegy made public three weeks ago appears to be unraveling. 

Dynegy's (nyse: DYN <http://www.forbes.com/finance/mktguideapps/compinfo/CompanyTearsheet.jhtml?tkr=DYN> - news <http://www.forbes.com/markets/company_news.jhtml?ticker=DYN> - people <http://www.forbes.com/peopletracker/results.jhtml?startRow=0&name=&ticker=DYN>) buyout of Enron (nyse: ENE <http://www.forbes.com/finance/mktguideapps/compinfo/CompanyTearsheet.jhtml?tkr=ENE> - news <http://www.forbes.com/markets/company_news.jhtml?ticker=ENE> - people <http://www.forbes.com/peopletracker/results.jhtml?startRow=0&name=&ticker=ENE>) was originally valued at $9 billion. But just as the deal was announced, Enron said its prior financial reporting was inaccurate and that it had overstated earnings by $586 million over the past four years. 

While the companies have not said the merger is off, investors don't believe it will happen, at least not at the stated price; they have bid Enron shares down to the point where the company has a market value of less than $3 billion. The shares closed yesterday at $4.01, down from $78 a year ago. 

The situation is in flux, as it has been for months. During that time, several top Enron executives have been forced to resign. Jeffrey Skilling, Enron's former chief executive officer, left in August for "personal reasons." 

Company officials said they hope to announce, perhaps as early as today, a series of changes: a lower price for the takeover; a cash infusion of $500 million; new, extended loan terms by Enron's bankers; and somehow, an agreement that prevents Dynegy from walking away in the face of litigation over Enron's devastated employee-retirement plan. Lawsuits by shareholders are sure to follow, considering Enron's restatement and the pay it lavished on executives, including Lay who received $135 million from salary, bonus and the exercise of stock options in 2000 alone. 

For now, Dynegy says it still wants to do a deal for its crosstown rival with 2000 revenue of $101 billion. 

Even more alarming than the deterioration in the share price is the crisis of confidence in Enron's reliability as a trading partner in worldwide energy markets. Last year, Enron was the dominant player in natural gas and electricity trading--a fast-paced, complex business quite removed from the company's history as a gas- and oil-pipeline builder and operator. The fear now is that other companies will refuse to trade with Enron out of trepidation that it will file for bankruptcy and not pay its bills. 

The company had $10.5 billion in debt as of its last annual report, and that number has likely grown by 20%. Already, credit agencies have cut their ratings on Enron debt. 

Dynegy and its partner, ChevronTexaco (nyse: CVX <http://www.forbes.com/finance/mktguideapps/compinfo/CompanyTearsheet.jhtml?tkr=CVX> - news <http://www.forbes.com/markets/company_news.jhtml?ticker=CVX> - people <http://www.forbes.com/peopletracker/results.jhtml?startRow=0&name=&ticker=CVX>), may pump billions of dollars into Enron's operations if the purchase goes through. But the deal will certainly undergo regulatory scrutiny and will take months to close. Investors and energy traders are increasingly doubtful that Enron can hang on by itself. 

Enron bills itself as one of the world's leading energy, commodities and services companies. It says it "markets electricity and natural gas, delivers energy and other physical commodities, and provides financial and risk management services to customers around the world." While all this may be true, its popularity with investors was based largely on its fast-growing revenue--much like the Internet companies whose collapse it mirrors. 

Few shareholders had any understanding of what Enron did to generate that revenue, and indeed Enron's own auditors at Arthur Andersen were confused. Most of the revenue was generated from trading, but the company's shares sold as if it was still an industrial company and not a financial firm. 

Enron was famous for being famous. Before the start of the 2000 baseball season, it purchased the rights to have its name on Houston's new ballpark. By 2002, Enron Field may need a new name. 

The name Enron itself sounds like it has something to do with energy, but it means nothing. At the time the company was formed from the merger of InterNorth of Omaha and Houston Natural Gas, the idea was to call the company Enteron. But the namers then looked in the dictionary and found out that Enteron means "intestines;" they decided to drop the "te" in the middle and go with Enron. Soon Enron may be part of Dynegy, a much smaller company in terms of revenue. If the deal falls apart, it may want to go back to Enteron.

fred/jeff- we just did a 6000 lot crude deal with global advisors- we actually had an order to do 6000 more but because of the 5000 lot limit we have in the cargill contract, we could not do it..

i am really proud of everyone's efforts here.

the deal was a brent/wti spread for CY02 (they bought WTI and sold Brent).. the idea was generated by us...global liked it and put it on.  

Global's head trader Danny Masters ran JPM's commodity group before starting his own fund and is one of the biggest traders in the market.

this is the largest crude deal we have done.

the execution was through John Thomas in London.. he did a great job.. made a fair price right away..

the deal confirmation between michelle and derek and cargill/global is going smoothly.

and most importantly we made 135k outright.

many more of these to come...

we have also traded about 2000 lots of nat gas with global since signing the legal agreement in August.

Rgds,
caroline

As you guys go through working up a severance program, I started thinking about some equity issues.  If the average tenure of an employee at Enron is about 3 years, why not come up with 2 plans--1 for long serving employees who have been long dedicated to the company, and a second one for the more recently hired?  It doesnt' make sense to me that someone who has been here under a year at $100,000 base should be entitled to 11 weeks even before they sign the waiver.  I would also not change the program in whatever form you ultimately settle on for the longer serving employees, rather just scale back the program for the newer employees.

Regards,

Jeff

I met with Jaime Vargas, President of BORCO and his staff including Matthew=
 Missick, Maxwell Sweeting and Jan Olson on Monday morning regarding the pr=
oposed tank repair financing for storage payback. BORCO is highly motivated=
 to do this deal and wants to supersize it ($10 million). Jaime's confident=
ial comment to Jan "was we need to do this deal." Last Thursday, BORCO had =
their board meeting in Freeport and all of the PDVSA attendees approved the=
 structure and concept of our deal. Jaime went on to say that PDVSA would l=
ook favorably on any term product purchase due to our new relationship with=
 BORCO.   Obviously, the devil is in the monthly storage numbers and our wi=
llingness to commit, but we can get very cheap tankage relative to other Ca=
rib storage facilities. BORCO is going to revert with monthly fees for one =
and two turns on all of the following liquid fuels: crude, jet, diesel, gas=
oline and resid. They are also checking the premium to LIBOR they are willi=
ng to pay and if we can lower the interest rate premium they will in turn r=

Excellent memo.  It should come from you and Pushkar, to Zufferli, Lavorato, Hickerson, and me.

Thanks, and sorry you had to do this, but I think it will ultimately be very helpful.

Dear Mr Shankman,
How's it going? As you may remember, I met you, Mr LeBeau, Ms Leibman, and Ms Li Sun at Cavanaughs with Matt Commons a few weeks ago.

During that meeting, you suggested that I visit Enron down in Houston in the next few weeks. As I have not been placed on the closed interview list at Wharton, I was wondering if I could conduct the interview process while in Houston? Please see my updated resume attached for your review.

Please let me know if this would be possible. I am still very interested in obtaining a full-time position in the Associate Program at Enron.

Kind regards,
Edward Divgi

Just got off the phone with the guy from the SPR again....

The royalty rate on most of the oil which they will be accpeting will be 16.7%, on the other smaller portion the rate is 12.5%, when I pushed him a little further, he let it slip that all of the oil would be coming from the Outer Continental Shelf.

Hi Tina,

Thanks for you help.  

The site is www.thewickerworks.com.  Click on it to go directly there.  The are in Houston at Walter Lee Culp.  713 623 4670.  

If you go to their web site go to the home page, then to the tab that says wicker, then to the tab that says more.  The design is Helva.

I need 1 Helva sofa, and 2 Helva loveseats, of course in a very plain off white (not tan as one of the pictures shows) indoor/outdoor fabric.

Or if you have any other ideas, let me know, of course.

Regards,

Jeff

         I've got 2 samples of fabric.  1 plain off white and the other a
      ribbed
         off
         white.  Elizabeth and I prefer the ribbed.
         Plain = $40 retail / $20 cost
         Ribbed = $50 retail  / $25 cost x 34 yards = $850
         I'll give them to you at cost so that we can continue furnishing
   your
         house
         ( I hear it's empty).
         If you have time this afternoon and can walk down to your Lobby I
   can
         meet
         you there to show you the fabrics.  Also, bring down a check so
   that
      I
         can
         stop by Walter Lee Culp and order you couches and fabric ma?ana.
      Fabric
         can
         be overnighted if needed or sent 2 day.
         I think 2 day is plenty of time.

         50% now - (not including taxes)
         50% later + shipping and taxes when couches are ready for delivery
      (6-8
         wks.).

         Need now
         $5445 for 2 loveseats and 1 couch + $850 for fabric = $6295
         I will give you a receipt.
         Let me know when you can see the fabric........

            Retail for couch is $5460 (saving $1170 about  27% lower)
            Retail for loveseat $4200 (saving $900 about 27% lower.)
            I may be able to save you more on the fabric if I can find the
   one
         you
            need
            at Kravets since they give me 50% off.  The majority of the
      furniture
            stores
            only give between a 20-30% off.  The couches take about 6-8
   weeks
      if
            they
            are in stock and usually are.  I'll get some fabric this Friday
         during
            lunch
            and maybe I can show you over coffee that afternoon.  I'll need
   to
         order
            the
            fabric so add another 2 weeks at least before the store gets
   it.
         Also,
            I'll
            find out paying conditions but usually is 50% upfront (cash)
   and
      then
            the
            other 50% when ready for delivery.  They don't take credit
   card.
         Checks
            payable to me and I pay with my company check.
            I'll get moving and call you on Friday.
            Sound good?

               8.25% tax = $626.18.
               Total = $8,216.18.  Both w/out fabric.

               You need a total of 23.5 yards of fabric.  I usually get
   about
      a
            30-35%

            I

         I'll

Jeff,
 
I would like to type a business plan for the group.   This plan will encorporate what the others discussed in their individual plans.  Also, I will try to address how we can sharpen the focus of the individual traders and narrow the scope of their trading.   I'm flying tomorrow and will do this on the plane.  My suggestion is we go over all of this thursday afternoon after the markets have closed.  Let me know if that time suits you.

We seem to be going round in circle's here and hence hopefully all the relevant people are now on copy of this e-mail so we can resolve swiftly. This cargo is due to be shipped in seven days with the coal already being railed to port. It is coal which will be shipped to service European commitments and represents the cheapest way to do so taking all costs into account (including financing). Needless to say if we pull out of this deal at this stage it will have huge ramifications with our customer and send all the wrong signals to our counterparties in this part of the world. Last but not least we will need to look elsewhere to procure coal for these European sales at what is likely to be a higher price.

Appreciate the green light.

Thks
Jez

It has been made clear to me that Jeff Shankman needs to clear this transaction through Bill Bradford and Louise Kitchen prior to any capital going out the door.  It is my understanding that this has not been done.

George:

Details on the cargo we are loading out of Newcastle.  Sailing time is roughly 45 days.  Cargo to be sold to ARA/German customers, most with payment terms 5 days post delivery.  Also - it would help to get an idea of how diificult this exercise will be in the coming months, as we have a couple more loading before year end.

Work it,

Stu

Stu,

I refer to your e-mail to Jez last week and advise you the expected payment value and timing etc.

Vessel name:	MV "Cotsworld"
ETA:		21/Nov 
ETS:		22/Nov
Loading tonnage: approx. 128kmt (9kmt from Stratford and 119kmt from Bengalla)
Payment value and timing :	
		Value		Timing	
 Bengalla:	US$3.3mil(*)	19th (**)
 Stratford:	US$0.2mil(*)	26th  		

* Inclusive of 10% GST
** Bengall has already delivered 49kmt of coal to port and will complete the delivery on 15th. 
The contract is based on FIS and the invoice weight and quality be determined by the inbound analysis while they take des/dem risk.
Because of their concern over our credit Bengalla has insisted on our payment by TT against the presentation of documents. Docs are likely to be 
presented on 16th or 19th at the latest. 

The draft contract which Bengalla has confirmed has a provision that the invoice weight is determined based on B/L quantity instead of inbound rail weight 
if we take 100% of Bengalla coal onto our vessel. If we do that, they can not present their docs until the vessel has compeleted the loading and our payment date would be say 26th instead.

Regards,


Tark

B and T,
I interviewed this guy yesterday, as did Chris M(can't remember his last name but he's a Director in Compression Svs Group).  For the record, but not to interfere with or prejudice the process, both Chris and I felt Aziz was, hands down, the best of about 10 candidates we interviewed. Paul does not have a blackberry or I wd sendthis msg to him.

Hi Christie,
                   I just received your response and tried calling to thank you for interviewing me yesterday. Your personal and prompt email is truly representative of Enron's ability to not only hire but also retain the best and the brightest. Up until today I have found no recruiter to bring out the problematic issues of a firm. The very fact that you put Enron's current problems on the table shows how strongly and genuinely you feel about the firm being secure and stable. I really appreciated you letting me defend Enron; it not only shows you my passion but also reiterates my genuine interest in the firm.
I am writing to let you know that I had second rounds today as you know and in the first interview, which was supposed to be conducted by Jen Fraser but was conducted by Matt, a first year analyst, the concern was on GPA and academic performance rather that what value I can add or my keen interest in the firm. I was extremely shaken after this first interview; in the interview right after, Sarah, an associate, did manage to alleviate some of my concerns. However, I was wondering if this could possibly serve as a road block in the recruiting process as I really do not believe that my GPA is low or an accurate representation of my capabilities to perform on the job. I honestly feel that a 3.2 at Wharton equates to a much higher GPA at any other school in the United States.
Although disheartened, I am extremely interested in Enron as a firm and am confident that if given the chance I will emerge as one of your most valued candidates. Thank you so very much.

Sincerely,
Aziz.

An old hillbilly farmer had a wife who nagged him unmercifully.  From
morning 'til night (and sometimes later), she was always complaining about
something.  The only time he got any relief was when he was out plowing
with his old mule.  He plowed a lot.

One day, when he was out plowing, his wife brought him lunch in the field.
He drove the old mule into the shade, sat down on a stump, and began to eat
his lunch.  Immediately, however, his wife began haranguing him again.
Complain, nag, nag; it just went on and on.  All of a sudden, the
old mule lashed out with both hind legs and caught her smack in the back of
the head, killing her dead on the spot.

At the funeral several days later, the minister noticed something rather
odd.  When a woman mourner would approach the old farmer, he would listen
for a minute then nod his head in agreement; but when a man approached him,
he would listen for a minute then shake his head in disagreement.  This was
so consistent, the minister decided to ask the old farmer about it.

So after the funeral, the minister spoke to the old farmer, and asked him
why he nodded his head and agreed with the women but always shook his head
and disagreed with the men.

The old farmer said, "Well, the women would come up and say something about
what a wonderful person my wife was, so I'd nod my head in agreement."

"And what about the men?" the minister asked.

"They all wanted to know if my mule was for sale."

Enron and the curse of Drexel 
Commentary: Energy trader's friends dry up
By David Callaway <<mailto:dcallaway@marketwatch.com>>, CBS.MarketWatch.com
Last Update: 1:15 AM ET Nov. 1, 2001
SAN FRANCISCO (CBS.MW) -- It was the master of its universe.

Its employees were rich, young and ruthless. It treated its clients and rivals alike, with disdain. Its leader counseled business tycoons and political powerbrokers alike. And when the bottom finally fell out, it didn't have a friend in the world to save it. 

Wall Street loves a success story. But it loves a success story gone wrong even more. Such was the case for Drexel Burnham Lambert, the junk bond empire of the 1980s, whose spiritual leader Michael Milken orchestrated one of the greatest financial shell games of all time before it collapsed in a heap of federal investigations, losses and the largest bankruptcy in Wall Street history. 

For Enron, the energy trading giant that has seen its shares lose more than two-thirds of their value this month amid questions about its financial transactions and its stability, the similarities are striking. 

Like Drexel, Enron set out to change an industry. Like Drexel, it succeeded, for a while. Under the guidance of Chairman Ken Lay, Enron evolved from a backwater Texas natural-gas pipeline company to become the nation's largest energy merchant. 

Its EnronOnline business transformed the way energy trading was done and funneled hundreds of billions of dollars in transactions through the company in last two years. The aggressive trading philosophy geared to squeezing a profit at all costs made millionaires of many employees, while those who were not deemed worthy simply vanished from the trading rooms, no questions asked. Enron was and is the dark star of the energy industry. 

For his part, Lay became an international corporate celebrity, advising President Bush on his campaign and taking a lead role with Vice President Dick Cheney on the administration's controversial energy plan earlier this year. 

But Enron's attempt to extend its dominance into the telecom industry and its secretive financial structure finally got the best of it. The unexplained resignation of its chief executive in August, the ouster of its chief financial officer last week and the company's inability to prove its financial health have prompted investors to bail out of Enron stock like jackrabbits escaping a brushfire. 

Now Lay & Co. are busy trying to raise cash from a skeptical Wall Street that is starting to admit it never understood the business in the first place (sound familiar?). Takeover speculation gave Enron shares a boost Wednesday, helping it end a 10-day losing streak. But it's unlikely anyone is going to step into this mess before a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into its finances yields a few more answers. 

For investors, a short-term rally beyond the jump Wednesday is still possible now that all of the big mutual funds have dumped the shares. But at a closing price of $13.90, Enron shares are more than a Texas mile from their 52-week high of $84.88 last December. 

For Enron itself, it's time to put its cards on the table with regulators and Wall Street. As the Drexel saga showed, a strategy of defiance to the end only hastens the end.

Do you know anyone interested in coming here as an options trader?  We need one for propane/lpg right away (which should be a big market for us--I'll go over why with you, but not in email).

Jeff,

Spoke to Michelle on Friday, she suggested that we have Masha Ariefieva, Andrew Hill and Dee Ware return to work as soon as possible.

I was thinking I would call each of them this afternoon to tell them to come back in starting tomorrow.  I would also plan to call Lowell, Matt and Matt to give him a head's up that they would be returning.  We would not share the results of the investigation with them, but would ask that they not discuss the case with anyone.

Ryan Seleznov has a meeting scheduled with Jen on Monday, 11/26.  Jeff's atty has been told that following the meeting with Jen, we would be prepared to issue a decision.

Ok with you?

Shanna

Strange inquiries from G7 Group, one of our FX consultants.  The word among their clients is that Enron is liquidating positions and that that is affecting Eurodollar trading.  I know that some of their top clients are Moore Capital, Tudor Capital, and Goldman Sachs.

Just thought you'd want to know.

Joe, this is outstanding.  How can we help you get our 24/7 crude product on EOL in Japanese?  I'd like to get this done this quarter.  Also, forgive my inability to add and subtract, but how much did you guys book on this transaction?

Mike/Jeff,
 
As indicated in the list of deals and interested cps that we sent you yesterday, we closed a transaction with Japanese trading company, Kobayashi Yoko, this afternoon.  Kinoshita and Anai had been working this company and had already gotten basic documentation and credit approval in place.  We had also gotten prior approval from Sheila Glover and Gary Hickerson to use the local metal's trader to handle FX swaps up to USD30MM.  Commodity and FX risk (except for 4 days from contract settlement) have been hedged with Singapore and ENA.  Not a big deal in and of itself (notional USD250k), but a start.  We believe there is much more demand and plan to see more in the near future.  Also expect to see first LPG deal with Marubeni with our new mid mkt "trader" very shortly.  We would back to back transaction as well.  Details of this transaction are as follows:
 
Enron Japan sells Dubai swap to Enron Singapore

Month: March 2002

Volume: 12,500bbls

Price: 20.24$/bbl

Enron Japan sells US$253,000 to ENA

Value date: 5 April 2002

Price: 118.92Y/$

Enron Japan buys Dubai swap from Kobayashi Yoko

Month: March 2002

Volume: 12,500bbls (=1,987.34 kl)

Price: 15,110Y/kl

Following on to conversation between you and Mike McConnell in the EGM Monday meetings last month, Rommel and I thought we would put some research together on the impact of the slumping economy on the freight sector.  No costs were accrued or will be charged back to you.  Understand that a lot of things are under review right now, but let me know if you want further research.

Jeff,

Confidentially, EBS in London is preparing to wind down, though officially no decision has been made.  I'll be back in Houston the week of the 21st talking to a variety of people about opportunities in Houston.  I'd like to schedule a little time with you that week. 

I'd appreciate any ideas you may have on where things are going and where a former spy/bandwidth trader might want to position himself.  Quite honestly, I'm looking for something compelling to do in Houston - Washington has been calling for me to return.

Look forward to seeing you.

I am very tired too, but I had a lot of fun. Please let me know when you have mood to do it again, and we should keep the place "secret". Last night's dinner was cancelled, so I didn't get the chance to send out the invitation to your party today. Have you made the decision to fly or drive to see your parents? When you get back, let's plan a Enron Wharton party.
 
All the best!

Hi Joe, 

I mentioned to you an associate from wharton who has been here for 2 years looking for another rotation.  She is very interested in Japan, and a hard worker.  Probably more of a market research, model building, person at this point in her career, but I don't know, and I don't want to sell her short.

What do you have for her?  I'd like to keep her around. 

Jeff

All,

Adrainne Engler is currently dropping resumes of Internal Analysts & Associates who responded  to the e:mail advertising the EGM Trading Track.   (some of these A&A are currently within EGM).

You will notice that some of the names who responded have an asterisk beside their names.   Pls note that this asterisk indicates a prc ratings below a 3.   Therefore we will more than likely not focus on these resumes (unless the EGM Management Team decides to approve an interview).

John  N - I will follow up with you to discuss the selection of candidates to be interviewed and finalise the interview dates.  

Kind regards,

Karen.

mike, jeff 

although for short term biz we are still trading as usual (we are fixing an average of one ship per working day in order to close heavily in the money short positions read in plain english to realize profits) and although we are keeping the deal pipeline alive for longer term biz it would help me a lot in order to keep on motivating my team and continue increase our positive ytd cashflow/realized margin and minimise our already very small average capital employed , to have following questions answered asap :

1/
what are the likely scenarios you see as off today for EGM/Coal/Vessel trading (being a grown up person please give me all the possible scenarios you see/ among other things management is the art of being prepared for the worse) 

2/
what is the scenario you are betting on 

3/
as EGM management what are you doing practically in order to make that scenario happen (a daily report on this would be much welcome for us to take steps to help things happen)

your timely feed back much appreciated . thanks

Jeff,

Not exactly how I phrased it.  This is really Greg's call, but we are certainly trying to conserve cash for existing business.  Let me know if you feel otherwise.

If you'd like to get together to have a drink and talk about something other

Jean's got a meeting at school tonight, but other than that we should be

Jeffrey-

It was good to visit with you this past weekend in Louisville.  As we
briefly discussed, I will be living in Chicago July 30 and would love an
opportunity to work for Enron in the Chicago office. In part of my due
diligence, I have found that Enron has numerous aspects to it's company.
Based on my past experience, a sales position would probably be most fitting
especially in the area of IT sales, broadband, and/or internet. I was given
Jennifer Cronin's name (IT recruiter-713-345-8267) and Kevin Ormston
(Broadband recruiter- 713-853-6418) from Paul Koontz who works with EBS in
Chicago (312-583-1676). I spoke with Jennifer but she was unaware of any
positions for EBS in Chicago, although she did say she would check with her
VP. We agreed that most of the opportunities for sales forces on the
web-site appear to be in the Houston area. Hopefully there may be another
way I could be part of Enron via a Chicago office or as part of a sales team
that would sell either IT services/ bandwidth to new customers, or even
service existing companies like Simon Property Group via Enron's Intelligent
Network on a national or international level.

In addition to the sales opportunity, I did see an Associates program
available for certain people through Enron that appears to be two, one-year
training programs that aids those employers in learning from the bottom up,
focusing on the business side of Enron.

Jeffrey, attached please find my resume (a hard copy will be easily
furnished if requested) and again, I would like to reiterate my willingness
to work both very hard and smart, in an attempt to become an employer with
Enron, in Chicago.

Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated,

Thank You,

Jeffrey Goldberg

All,

Attached is an invitation to a Young Friends cocktail reception at the Houston Center for Contemporary Craft on November 29th.  The HCCC is a nonprofit organization with a mission to advance education about the process, product and history of craft.  While we are describing this as a "Young Friends" event, any and all are welcome, you just need to be young at heart!!  Please help us to kick this organization off right!!  

Did I mention the free wine, beer and food from Carrabba's, and the possibility of winning a luxury weekend at the new Hotel Derek????  Hope to see you there!!

Rachael

Hi

You are probably aware of reports in the Nikkei regarding Morgan Stanley's formation of an electricity forward swaps market. I just got a call from a broker (Natsource) and apparently there are the following quotes in the market:

* Bid for Cal 2002 (1 year swap), day peak power (10-30MW) in the 50Hz region : 13Y/kWh
* Offer for Cal 2003, 2004 (1 year swap), day peak power (10-50MW) in the 50Hz, 60Hz region : 14Y/kWh

I told him I would get back to him with an answer next week (I will tell him we can't do it). Note that, if we wanted, we could do FY 2003 baseload power (16MW) for 6Y/kWh (Nippon Chemicon).

Jeff,

I am trying to project the next month with NIC (and announcements, etc) and want to determine what would provide the greatest impact for us.  We will be discussing the budget tomorrow and I'd like to also determine when we can review our draft MOU with you and Mike.  We plan to show this to NIC by Thursday of this week.  Still plan on being over the week after next.

Joe

trading:  I'd like to set up a time to speak with you about this.  I also interviewed Brad McKay and Gregg Cooper.  I have asked HR to make sure that these guys come and speak with you as well (this week).

Dear Mr Shankman,
How's it going? As you may remember, I met you, Mr LeBeau, Ms Leibman, and Ms Li Sun at Cavanaughs with Matt Commons a few weeks ago.

During that meeting, you suggested that I visit Enron down in Houston in the next few weeks. As I have not been placed on the closed interview list at Wharton, I was wondering if I could conduct the interview process while in Houston? Please see my updated resume attached for your review.

Please let me know if this would be possible. I am still very interested in obtaining a full-time position in the Associate Program at Enron.

Kind regards,
Edward Divgi

Mike and Jeff:  

Yesterday, Harry Kingerski from Government Affairs testified before the Georgia state commission, advocating the use and benefits of weather derivatives.  Harry heads up our rates/technical division within Government Affairs - he has excellent technical skills and is very highly regarded by state commissioners nationwide.  I wanted to report back to you that Harry received very positive feedback from various groups attending the hearing.  He commented to me this morning that the Commissioners were very attentive when he discussed weather products, and basically snoozed through the remainder of the hearing!!  He has recommended to Mark's group that we talk directly to the Commissioners (outside of the litigation process) to further educate them on our products.     

We are also advocating weather products in other state proceedings, as opportunities arise.  All of this work is being done internally within Government Affairs, drawing upon various areas of expertise.   

We will keep plugging away, but wanted you to know that, so far, we are getting good feedback!!

Subject:	Georgia Power Rate Case

Yesterday, we were cross-examined on our testimony at hearings before the Georgia Public Service Commission.  One of the main points in our testimony was that Georgia Power should be required to use weather hedges to mitigate weather-related volume risk.  We made the point that hedges would be superior to the revenue sharing approach proposed by Georgia Power, and could save customers significant amounts of money.

Although a final PSC decision isn't scheduled until early in December, there were a couple of positive signs at the hearing.  Several othere intervenors, including Commission staff, talked to us informally about the idea and seemed to see benefit in the weather hedging approach.  Also, the 4 commissioners seemed particularly attentive when we described the weather issue during the hearing (a noticeable difference, compared to their attention on most issues).

We may have opportunity to visit informally with the commissioners later in November.  If we can arrange it, would one of you be interested in giving a brief overview of the weather market and the participants (the on-the-shelf presentation you have would be fine)?   This could help with their final decision.

On a different front, we are planning an intervention in a Gulf Power rate case in Florida to promote weather hedging.  Bob and I think the issues there are similar.  Our due date for testimony there is early in December. 

Thanks to each of you for helping us prepare the materials for these cases.

Keep it in

		Anyway,  I paid $10,900 plus tax, total $11799.25.  For you
$6,000.
		There are no more available, only 1912 were made in total.
(divided

		Find me a girlfriend, please.

George,

Jeff has just signed your expense account from last month.  It has been on hold because we have stopped approving all submitted reports that include car services (for all of EGM) that are outside of the direct airport to the hotel charges.  We have made statements to everyone via memo and our commitment to our bosses that we are watching our costs especially those like these specifically.  In most cities cabs or other shorter hires are available.  

We are not attempting to be cheap but we have put this is a hard rule and of course includes Jeff and me.  We haven't and will not do it either.  We don't want to discuss this further and it is not something we will think about again but we wanted to be clear.

Thanks,
Mike and Jeff

Dear Jeff: 
Here's a copy of the letter I received from Italy. I will keep trying for you. 
Peter 
Hallo Peter, 
We are all glad you are doing well. The latest news shocked all Europe too, and thinghs are changed here as well. Today Mr. George Bush senior is here in Milano, and the city is on siege. There are the fashion shows on right now, but everybody is really laying low... 
 But eventually, and hopefully, things will settle, and (hopefully) business will be as usual again. 
Your Mies chair was quite a lucky find! Giovanni and I were looking for a similar chair for a while, but came out empty handed. All the other Design dealers we know have'nt seen one for a while... but we'll keep looking. 
We were also planning a visit to the NY Modernism show at the beginning of November. We thought they were going to cancel the event.... but they said "business as usual"! 
And we were happy to hear this. So we will be in the USA for a while, and a trip to Houston could be part of it.

Dear Kite and Key Alumni:

Thank you for taking the time to respond to our letter this past
summer.  The Kite and Key Executive Board is excited to have such an
active group of alumni who are interested in establishing a Board of
Governors!  To become acquainted with one another, we would like to
invite you to a Kite and Key Homecoming Reception that will occur after
the Penn-Princeton football game on Saturday, November 3rd.  The
gathering will be held in the Sweeten House, 3533 Locust Walk,
approximately at 4:00.  Attending the reception will be many current
Kite and Key students, as well as other Penn Alumni, with whom you can
speak.  For those of you who are interested, we hope to informally and
individually gather your ideas and visions of an Alumni Board of
Governors.  Food and drinks will be served.

To keep you updated on the most recent Kite and Key news and programs,
we have attached the Fall 2001 Newsletter that was distributed at our
first General Meeting in September.  Inside, you will find information
about the exciting initiatives that each of our projects hope to achieve
in the coming months.

We hope that you can attend the reception during Homecoming weekend.  If
you believe you will be able to join us, please RSVP to
jeffreyi@sas.upenn.edu and provide us with the number of guests in your
party.  If you cannot attend and would like to offer us input, please do
so by e-mailing jeffreyi@sas.upenn.edu.  We look forward to seeing you
on November 3rd!

Warmly,


Jeffrey Stewart					David Greene

If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

I hope your thanksgiving was good.  I'd like to make some progress on your loan with me.  I'd be happy to take $11,500 worth of land now, or you can start repaying me right away until you sell the land.  In any event, I am looking for full repayment of some sort by December 31, 2001.  

I know you are trying to get this all worked out, but I need to be treated fairly as well.

Regards,

Jeff

As you can see, the crude P&L is down dramatically this quarter.  Approx. $20 million has been taken out of the portfolio and funded the internal credit reserve for Timber, etc.  Meaning this money is in the building.  

In addition, we are very aggressively getting out of physical options since we don't have the cash to fund a little over 250,000,000 physical product if we were to exercise the in the money options.  The expense is due to lack of liquidity, and few counterparties willing to trade with us.

Further, we have been aggressively reducing almost all physical inventories worldwide--dist in europe, panama, etc.  

As well, we have been taking off Asian positions, consolidating books, and pay to get flat everyday.  


While the P&L is ugly, we have been assuming that any new crude operation will be very small and are working to get there.

Please feel free to call with any questions.

 Mike/Jeff:
 
Basic commercial items discussed during meetings from last week.  We will be following up with the different groups to try and push forward.  I will also be getting with the different business heads to further gauge their feedback (interests/concerns).  I'd like to set a time to speak with the both of you regarding feedback on the way forward (MOU development).  Also progress with steel, softs (trade finance) and non ferrous.
 
Thanks for your support last week.

Jeff,

Tony Galt, of the LNG group, gave two weeks notice last week.  His last day will be October 31st.  Tony functions as the LNG group's marine superintendent, reporting to Tim Nash under Jonathan Whitehead.  It appears that Tim Nash will be picking up these functions for at least the remainder of the year.  Let me know if you would like any further information.

David,
I run a $650 million dollar commodities fund at Harvard Management Company.  Our focus has been on arbitrage strategies in the commodity arena - we are looking to expand into weather and power. I was wondering, if given the potential situation at Enron, that there might be employees interested in interviewing for several positions both within my group and foreign equities ? I apologize if this is too forward or that I have assumed too much in terms of potential restructurings.
Thanks,

Stuart D. Porter

I phoned Steve Semlitz at Hess (Hetco)  He thinks we owe them 13.9, and told him we were addressing all issues, and I (or Tom Moran) would get back with him today.  They are still trading with us, but want to take margin threshold to $0.

Here's an update:

- We received detailed comments back from them on Monday, as reqd.
- We discussed these w/them, our legal and Morgan on Tues to clarify some items.
- Called them today to officially kill based mainly on the fact that in their response they had pulled the gathering system out of the collateral pool and proposed putting the gathered crude to the refinery at market rather than cost. This is a reduction of $5MM/yr in earnings and $10-15MM in collateral.
- After quite a bit of discussion today, it's clear they still want to get the deal done and are willing to revert back to having the gathered crude in at cost and as part of the collateral. The major issue is trying to find a structure in which they have some upside in the transaction beyond just the locked 1.4 coverage.

So...I said that if we get something in writing that puts gathering back in and satisfies our other reqmts, we will then try to revise the structure to give them a little more upside. Norman is traveling tomorrow and will get us something on Monday.

Below is a summary of my discussion w/ Norman Abood (General Counsel for GAF) in response to our termination letter dated 10/16/01 and his written response on 10/17.  Basically, I told Norman it was time to stop the paper trail and either get down to closing or go our separate ways.  I emphasized our primary concerns as follows:
  
	1.  GAF's ability to fund its equity
	2.  finalizing the feedstock supply and products off-take
	3.  Morgan's commitment to finance the debt 
	4.  defining the pool of assets to be collateralized
	5.  evidence of insurability, and 
	6.  restructuring of GAF's PSA w/ Farmland.

I also emphasized our frustration over the "continually moving targets" (debt, collateral, equity, feedstocks, etc...) and told him I will NOT continue to expend resources and time playing games.  Finally, I told him I was willing to re-engage on the following terms:

	a.  GAF submit either a written set of comments to our 9/21 MOU or a counter-proposal to us by Monday, 10/22.
	b.  If, subject to OUR review and based on US believing there's merit to proceed that we get ALL PARTIES (GAF, 	     Morgan Stanley and EGM) together and hammer out a definitive and final version of the MOU including, but not 		     limited to the primary concerns above (w/ all parties having "subject to senior management and/or Board approval" 	     language/conditions).  The purpose here is to get all the T&C down in writing with everyone in the room in 	     conceptual agreement which will make it more difficult for the targets to move.
	c.  Morgan Stanley must be willing to sign some form of commitment letter evidencing their willingness to finance the 	     transaction.

GAF will then have some finite/specific period of time in which to approach Farmland and restructure their deal as necessary to close the transaction.

Norman agreed in principle and committed to get back to us by tomorrow.  Hopefully, this will once and for all define whether or not this deal can get done.

Mark, 

A couple of follow-up questions in addition to our discussion/needs at lunch.

The weather business should be cash flow positive next year.  Brent shows $34 million with upside.  What are the key drivers and factors that will determine that.  How much confidence do you have in that or your estimated $ amount?

What is the total capital or balance sheet needed in 2002?

How many total people (support/analytics) are needed to run the weather group in the scenarios 1 and 2 situations.  In your scenario 1 you cut 23 people (26 remaining) and in scenario 2 you cut 36 with 13 remaining.

Thanks,
Mike

I spoke to Pbras Houston and they tell me that "so far" refineries have been running at normal capacities but this can not be sustained if the strike continues beyond Monday.

Subject:	RE: petrobras update

our agent just called in to say that the view in the unions is they will vote this weekend to extend the strike past sunday, as the only way to twist petrobras' arm.
he says they will not be able to shut down the refs but will lower the wick to the absolute minimum allowed by law, which means about a 40pct reduction in distillate production.

Subject:	petrobras update

just talked to marcello castilho, the head of petrobras office in london.  he gave me the following:
their crude production is down by 900mbd.  they have crude and product stocks for the next 5 days, but then will need to buy. initially the thought wud b to buy crude however, the situation may have worsened at the refineries.
he was pessimistic about the discussions. said that petrobras called them to a meeting ydy as everyone knows and only upped the ante by 1pct on their side vs the 8.5 sought plus the inflation catch-up of 42pct. this really angered the unions and they have now said they will not come back to the table before seeing the numbers next time.  he said petrobras is up against internal competition now from other oil and gas companies who are offering ex petrobras workers a 15pct increase over their current pay, so petrobras is in a poor position.

so far the refs have been running at very low rates and the managers have not allowed the workers to leave the prmeises but have bunked them and fed them their in 12 hour shifts. by law they can only do this for 3 days and some fighting has already broken out at one location, so doubtful they can continue the 'imprisonment' much longer.

if it comes to a bigger showdown he thinks the unions will just shut the refs down on the last shift that they work, and he will be buying product not crude.

The current Bengalla purchase transaction for approximately $3.5mm is approved by credit and from a cash flow standpoint.  Please continue to approve transactions through credit.  However, for the most part we will treat the coal business, as business as usual.

Thanks,

George,

I would be happy to discuss with you.  It remains critical that we manage all cash requirements as our access to capital markets has been impacted over the past few weeks.  Hopefully the announcement on Friday will improve our ability to execute transactions like this in future, but prior to Friday this was a necessary precaution.  Unfortunately, you are working at a different company than you were a few weeks ago.

We can discuss next week.

Bill

The Bengalla deal was struck after I had given ECAP notice of the liquidity problems, and more importantly, without any RAC involvement.

>From a RAC perspective this deal is still unapproved.  If an invoice discount facility can be used, or some other means of performing without using Enron capital then you should move forward.  If these options are not available, then the issue should either be raised to Louise Kitchen for approval or unwound until the liquidity problems are resolved.

		I assume this does not apply to ECTRL business, as we have not been given a reciprocal recommendation for European biz.  Can you confirm this?  Also, can you clarify what the specific issue is with ECAP that is not an issue with ECTRL?  Is this specific to cash flow within Australian entities?

		Thanks,

			In light of the current situation in Houston, I recommend we wait to finalize any physical coal sourcing or deliveries in the ECAP business.  In short, RAC cannot approve any purchase or sale until the liquidity issues are resolved.  Hopefully by the end of the week we will know more, have things settled, and business can continue as normal.

			Please call me if you have any questions.

Hi Jeff:

Just wanted to drop you a quick note to let you know that it was a pleasure meeting you at Wharton.  I am enclosing my resume as we discussed. As a reminder, I am the student from Nigeria you spoke to at the end of the program at Wharton - you wanted me to mention that when I wrote to you.  It is nice to hear that you are still in Nigeria.  Jeff, I am open to discussing opportunities anywhere in the World.

After conversations with both Matt Zaklad and Neel Broker (your summer associates) I am convinced that Enron provides the right environment for me to begin my post-MBA career.  I am excited about the possibility of working for Enron.  I am requesting that I be included on your closed list.

For your information, I spent the summer at Morgan Stanley working with the Securitized Products Group and the Principal Transactions Group. I am a US trained professional engineer.  Please let me know if I can provide you with any additional information.

Look forward to hearing from you and speaking with you about opportunities.

Regards,
Lenka

Dear Jeff,

following my phonecall from some time ago, I was waiting for the promised
cheque for the Josef Schulz work you purchased at this years Art Chicago.
Until today, I did not get this cheque and I was wondering if something
went wrong or the cheque got lost in the mail.
Could you please be so kind and check this issue.

If there is any problem in sending a cheque in general, you can also wire
the money if you prefer to do so.
Here are the details of our account:

Bank: Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg, Karlsruhe
Account: 4020464
BLZ (Bank registration number): 60050101
Account holder: Galerie Haus Schneider
SWIFT code: SOLADEST

Please excuse this email if you did  send the cheque in the meantime.
However, it would be very nice if you could drop me an answer by email anyhow.

With warmest regards,
Heinz-Martin Weigand
Galerie Haus Schneider

Jeremy will be sending you the updated internal deal list to give you a fee=
l for the types of things we are working on and where we stand.  We'd like =
to discuss this further with you.  I think you will see from the types of t=
ransactions and the relative value that the 2002 plan numbers are not unrea=
listic.  However, in order to achieve these numbers will require some stron=
g support from Houston and additional expat staff.  We have focused on reas=
onableness of the size of transactions that we are seeing to date and what =
we would additionally plan to see.  We have also focused on trying to do mo=
re with less (Sato proposition) and shooting for just north of break even. =
 Additionally, I am under the belief that you are stretching all of the gro=
ups and anything less than covering costs would not be acceptable.  While S=
ato would not be required to achieve these numbers, it would certainly be e=
asier with them.  (... don't mean for this to be interpreted that we should=
 have higher numbers with Sato...).

Dear Executive Committee Members,

At our first meeting of the year, which was very productive (and therefore
too long), we neglected to ask your preference for a meeting day, time and
place.

Last year the committee met on Wednesdays at Noon in the English Room at the
Bayou Club and that seemed to work very well for the members. How does that
sound to you?

We pre-ordered lunches to save time and billed members for their lunches at
the end of the year. Our next meeting is presently scheduled for OCTOBER 10
and below is a list of the other dates for the year. Please let us know if
this schedule works for you and if meeting at Noon works for you as well.

Thanks.

Mike/Jeff,
 
Understand interesting times, but we are very close to closing the biggest weather deal done in Japan with Tokyo Gas (3 month Dec-Feb collar, 900M Yen max payout).  Given current situation with Enron, however, TG is now concerned about E's credit.  We spoke to Hitachi today and they would be willing to sleeve this for us for 2% of premium (about $15k).  Hitachi also has strong relationship with TG and they are trying to use this so that we can get the deal.  Relationship being called on from high levels within Hitachi.  Hijikata (our guy) has been told by TG that we now have the best price.  We will need relationship to get done as some concern by TG of Enron reputational risk even if we are behind Hitachi.
 
Great pricing and coordination/cooperation with Mark's guys in US/Australia.
 
Joe

Jeff -- Sorry for the delay in getting back to you.  I do not have any notes from Monday's Dynegy conference call, but the script has been filed w/ the SEC and it's on our website under "Investor Relations -- SEC filings."

Let me know if you need anything else.

I have had many complaints over the last year about the inability for the interest rate group to set their curves on time and on a consistant basis.  Every few months I once again ask Puskar (sp) and/or Gary to deal with this.  I am getting very upset.  We have 50 to 100 risk book runners who are forced to work late always siting the interest rate curve as the reaon.  
 
Please Help

Jeff:  I sent this last week but didn't have your email address correct.  I
understand from Sunita that my expense report is still pending your
approval.  I'll be happy to call or stop by to explain if there is a
problem.  If there is not a problem, I would appreciate your approval
soon---I paid Amex several weeks ago and would appreciate reimbursement.

Hope all is well and that things settle down inside Enron---sounds bad from
the outside.

Rick


Jeff:  Sunita (my former assistant in Dubai)has recently submitted an
expense report for your approval.  She will be submitting another one next
month when additional Amex bills are processed (Amex is slower in Dubai than
in the US).  I thought you might appreciate an explanation for the major
items.

1.  Most of the big items relate to a trip in October for my wife and I to
come to Dubai to pack up our stuff (as envisioned and agreed in my
separation arrangements.)  Part of the airline charges were on this month's
Amex;  the rest (along with related hotel & travel expenses) will be on next
month's.

2.  There are some trailing charges for August expenses while I was still
employed (for example, a rental car for my last 2 weeks in Houston closing
out office affairs, some lunches/dinners for former employees who had worked
for me, phone/fax related to close-out etc

3.  Finally, there will be several lunches/dinners related to my current
visit to Dubai.  When I arrived in Dubai last week, Darrin Donegan told me
that a former Enron employee that has chosen to stay in the region is
apparently bitter and is creating some potential problems for Enron.  I told
him that I would be happy to visit with some of my former key contacts to
help set the record straight and ensure that Enron continues to be viewed in
the best light possible.

Hope all is well with you--I'm looking forward to tomorrow's earnings
report.

All the best,

Rick

$35.1B company based in SF
Merger closed 9 October 2001
Trimming down to around 53k employees by end-02, charges by end-01



-- DJ ChevronTexaco/Terminations -2: Began Reductions In 4Q --

 
  WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--ChevronTexaco Corp. (CVX) said it began a work force
reduction program in the fourth quarter that is expected to result in the
reduction of about 7% of its 57,000 employees. 
  Substantially all the reductions are expected to occur by the end of 2002,
according to the company's quarterly report filed late Tuesday with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. 
  The newly-combined company said it expects to realize significant recurring
cost savings from the work force reductions and other actions, after one-time
merger-related costs. 
  The company said it would provide detailed information on the expected annual
savings from the merger, as well as the expected one-time merger-related
expenses, later in the fourth quarter ending Dec. 31. 
  As reported, ChevronTexaco was formed by the merger of Chevron and Texaco on
Oct. 9 in a stock swap valued at $35.1 billion. 
  The combined company, based in San Francisco, develops, explores for, refines
and transports crude oil and gas.

John, 

I don't have all the facts around this transaction, but I don't think you are authorized to hedge currency exposure with outside counterparties as you've outlined in your email to Hickerson, etc.  I'd appreciate some information.

Jeff

WILL wonders never cease? Last week a couple of heavy hitters left money on=
 the table.=20
Mark McGwire, the home-run-hitting baseball player for St. Louis, retired. =
And he let it be known that he never signed a two-year, $30 million contrac=
t his agent negotiated last spring. Why? Because he wanted to find out if h=
is injured right knee would allow him to play as well as he had before. It =
didn't, and he decided he wasn't worth that kind of money.
Then Ken Lay, chairman of Enron Corp., said he won't take the $60.6 million=
 he had coming to him in a severance agreement that comes into play when En=
ron is sold to Dynegy Corp.=20
Of course, neither McGwire nor Lay will ever have to consider my fallback r=
etirement plan - sacking groceries at the supermarket, carrying them to the=
 car and hoping for a big tip. Still, it was a class act on both their part=
s. McGwire only hit .187 last season, well below his lifetime average. And =
Lay? Well, let's say that rarely in the history of American capitalism has =
a company sunk as fast as Enron.=20
Remember that earlier this year its stock hit a top of $82 a share. Now it'=
s hovering in the single-digit level, and Enron is being forced to sell its=
elf to a smaller rival.=20
The stock price incentive=20
How did Enron get into this position? Put the blame on the company's relent=
less drive to push up its stock price. And a big reason for that push comes=
 from the way American companies compensate top executives.=20
In the last couple of decades, executive compensation has soared. The avera=
ge chief executive officer today makes 531 times as much in salary, bonuses=
 and stock options as the average factory worker.=20
Apologists for executive pay say these kinds of figures really aren't relev=
ant. Most of the money top executives receive doesn't come from base pay or=
 bonuses but from stock options.=20
Such options usually work this way. Executives are given hundreds or thousa=
nds of shares of stock that they can only buy from the company at a future =
date. The sales price can be anything from 10 cents to the price of the sto=
ck on the date the options were granted. If the stock increases past the ex=
ercise price in the option, the executive can buy the stock and then sell i=
t, making big bucks. It the stock has dropped below the option price - it's=
 underwater, in the jargon - then those options are worthless.=20
Granting options aligns the interests of the top executives with the shareh=
olders, those who favor this sort of incentive say. And that's true, if you=
 talking about in-and-out traders. But it's not true if we're looking out f=
or the interests of the majority who hold stocks for the long term.=20
Keeping the debt hidden=20
Keeping its stock price soaring was what brought down Enron.=20
To hype the stock, Enron's execs were hiding the debt it took on to fuel it=
s amazing growth and some of its dicier investments, in partnerships. Enron=
 was supposedly only a minority partner in these deals. That way it could m=
ove a large portion of its debt off its books in that partnership. That, in=
 turn, made the company's earnings look better.=20
When Enron's executives finally fessed up, they had to write down their pro=
fits over the past few years by 20 percent. But the real irony here is that=
 80 percent is still a heck of a lot of money. But by that time, the majori=
ty of shareholders simply had no faith in Enron's bookkeeping.=20
Now look at Lay's compensation. In 1999 he exercised stock options and made=
 $44 million on them. In 2000, sales of options brought him $123 million, a=
nd this year about $26 million, according to a study published by Bloomberg=
 News.=20
Was Lay deliberating deceiving investors to keep his stock options profitab=
le? I don't think so. He was simply following the latest fad in corporate g=
overnance. He was aligning himself with the interests of the shareholders.=
=20
The shareholders were happy with that high stock price. Nobody - besides so=
me stock analysts - complained about Enron's often- impenetrable bookkeepin=
g until that stock price started to fall.=20
Would Enron's bookkeeping have been different if top executives received fe=
wer stock options? Maybe.=20
Fewer stock options would mean lower pay for the top guys. And no one would=
 want that job if he were only going to make $10 million a year instead of =
$100 million.=20
Just kidding.

18.33 points, or 1.6 percent, to 1,138.65.=20
But bond prices tumbled while yields, which move in the opposite direction,=
 soared. The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note rose to 4.85 percent, fro=

Investing
Bullish, and Patient, on Energy Stocks
By JAN M. ROSEN

11/18/2001
The New York Times
Page 8, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company

DESPITE last week's plunge in the price of crude oil and in shares of big o=
il companies, some Wall Street analysts remain upbeat about the long-term p=
rospects for energy stocks.=20
''These very dramatic downturns are great buying opportunities,'' said Tina=
 Vital, an oil and gas analyst at Standard & Poor's, who recommends a broad=
 group of integrated oil companies, including Exxon Mobil, ChevronTexaco, R=
oyal Dutch/Shell, BP and TotalFinaElf. ''They have excellent management, a =
top dividend yield and are a safe haven for investors,'' she said, provided=
 that investors are patient and can bear short-term swings.
Last week's price declines were set off by Russian oil companies' refusal t=
o accept demands by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries f=
or big production cuts. They were a reminder that the sector is extremely v=
olatile. ''Oil could go to $10 a barrel short term,'' she said, but there i=
s no certainty of that. The oil producers could reach an agreement by Janua=
ry, sending prices upward. Over the long term, she expects to see productio=
n cuts.=20
Demand for energy has grown only 0.5 percent this year, and prices have bee=
n declining for some time for both crude oil and gasoline -- as drivers hav=
e seen at the gas pump. West Texas intermediate crude closed Friday at $18.=
03 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, up 58 cents from its Thursday close=
, the lowest since June 1999. But an economic recovery, expected by late 20=
02, could cause demand to pick up, analysts say.=20
As oil prices have dropped, so have the prices of most oil stocks, but not =
as much as the overall market since the beginning of 2000. Over that period=
, the S.& P. energy index has lost 8 percent, while the S.& P. 500-stock in=
dex is down 23 percent.=20
A report issued last week by the Energy Department said that while the Sept=
. 11 terrorist attacks had intensified the country's economic slowdown, ''t=
hey are not expected to result in any long-term volatility in energy market=
s.'' The report estimated that commercial energy demand would rise 1.7 perc=
ent a year through 2020, instead of the 1.2 percent predicted only a year a=
go. Its predictions assume increased use of computers and office equipment,=
 and slower increases in fuel efficiency for cars and trucks.=20
WHILE they warn of the possibility of wild price shifts in the months ahead=
, other analysts are similarly bullish for the long term. L. Bruce Lanni, s=
enior oil analyst at A. G. Edwards & Sons in New York, said that any potent=
ial price war was likely to be fairly short-lived, because neither OPEC nor=
 non-OPEC countries could ''withstand low oil prices for a prolonged period=
 of time,'' and prices should rebound sharply as a result, ''back up in the=
 lower to mid-$20 range.''=20
Low prices could be painful for most of the oil companies in the short term=
, but Mr. Lanni, too, sees value in the stocks.=20
His top pick is Conoco, now trading at $24.30; his 12-month target is $34. =
''We remain confident,'' he said, ''that the company's annual oil and gas p=
roduction should grow by about 4 percent, on average, over the next several=
 years.''=20
Conoco's debt, at 55 percent of capital, is relatively high, but he expects=
 the company's strong cash flow -- it equaled $5.33 a share last year -- to=
 reduce the debt level to 46 percent next year and to 38 percent in 2003. T=
he company's after-tax interest cost is only 3.5 percent, he said.=20
Mr. Lanni also favors Kerr-McGee, a natural gas exploration and production =
company, and BP, calling both undervalued. He regards Exxon Mobil, Royal Du=
tch/Shell and ChevronTexaco as fully priced, so he is not recommending buyi=
ng them now. ''If you own them, hold them,'' he said.=20
William Featherston, executive director and an oil and gas exploration anal=
yst at UBS Warburg, said he felt ''near-term caution but medium-term optimi=
sm for sustainably higher'' natural gas prices. He said he would encourage =
investors to consider buying shares of exploration and production companies=
 over the next two months. His top picks are Apache, Kerr-McGee and EOG Res=
ources.=20
Such stocks are highly volatile, he said. They are ''trading-oriented vehic=
les, and short-term volatility in commodity prices generally provides the m=
ost attractive entry and exit points,'' he said. ''While natural gas prices=
 declined throughout most of this year, prices rose at a startling pace, fr=
om $1.75 per million cubic feet at the end of September to over $3 per mill=
ion cubic feet within weeks.''=20
He cited three reasons for the price rally: a decline in gas surpluses, pre=
dictions of a colder-than-normal winter and what he has called ''pathetic t=
hird-quarter natural gas production,'' despite record drilling activity.=20
The tangled finances of the Enron Corporation were also a factor in the rec=
ent price increase for natural gas futures, he said. Enron, which marketed =
25 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas, or more than 40 percent of the =
nation's demand, is under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Comm=
ission and announced a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity from de=
als with partnerships involving its former chief financial officer. It also=
 reported a third-quarter loss and restated earlier earnings. Enron has agr=
eed to be taken over by Dynegy, a smaller rival, for about $9 billion in st=
ock. Dynegy is also assuming about $13 billion in debt.=20
Anxiety over whether the Enron investigation would disrupt deliveries or ha=
ve other market repercussions led to an increase in prices. While it is ''d=
ifficult to quantify the Enron factor,'' Mr. Featherston said, the short-te=
rm effects on natural gas prices seem to be over.=20
OTHER factors, of course, could also mean a bumpy ride for energy investors=
 over the next several months. The status of the war against terrorism, Pre=
sident Bush's decision to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, thus helpin=
g OPEC in reducing excess global capacity, and a United Nations review of t=
he food-for-oil deal with Iraq expected in December could each have a signi=
ficant impact on battered oil prices.=20
Nevertheless, Ms. Vital said, for the long term, energy will probably be in=
 short supply, and new sources must be developed. So she also likes the pro=
spects of two drilling companies, Noble Drilling and Nabors Industries. Bot=
h took a beating last week, along with the oil companies, so again she sees=
 buying opportunities.=20
Bern Fleming, portfolio manager of the AXP Utilities Income fund in Minneap=
olis, who has stakes in Dynegy, Duke Energy and Dominion Resources, said al=
l three had good prospects for growth, thanks to a mix of assets, ''managem=
ent I respect and solid business plans.''

Aquila Energy Makes Provision for Dynegy Withdrawal, FT Says
2001-11-18 19:52 (New York)

     Houston, Nov. 19 (Bloomberg) -- Aquila Energy Corp. is one of
several energy traders limiting its trading with Enron Corp. in
case Dynegy Inc. pulls out of its bid for the company, the
Financial Times said, citing Aquila.

     Aquila said it began making contingency plans in case Dynegy
withdrew from its $24 billion takeover of Enron, the paper
reported.

     Enron, the largest energy trader, decided to sell after its
shares plunged this year and a federal investigation of accounting
irregularities limited its ability to finance operations. Enron's
collapse would have caused upheaval in energy markets, where the
company does one-quarter of all gas and power trades.

     Dynegy's agreement to buy Enron allows it to withdraw from
the transaction under certain circumstances, the FT said.



PERSPECTIVES
A tale of greed and hubris
Waldo Proffitt

11/18/2001
Sarasota Herald-Tribune
All
F2
(Copyright 2001)

For anyone not already disenchanted with the idea of total deregulation of =
public utilities, the most recent installment of the miserable Enron story =
as it unfolded last week should serve as a convincing example of the folly =
of relying on unregulated profit- driven enterprises to supply our energy.=
=20
A year ago Enron was the darling of Wall Street, the poster boy for the uti=
lity industry, its stock selling for about $85 a share. Last week its stock=
 was worth about 10 percent of that and the company had agreed to be bought=
 by a competitor. There was fear the company's bond rating might fall to th=
e "junk" level.
What happened? It will take months, if not years, to untangle the details, =
but it is clear that the main culprit was greed, closely followed by hubris=
.=20
Not too many years ago Enron was a small, struggling, gas pipeline company =
in Houston. As deregulation spread to more and more states, Enron began acq=
uiring pipelines, gas producers and utilities.=20
It also acquired friends in high places, especially the Bush family and the=
ir key political advisers. And, it discovered it could make money faster by=
 selling and trading energy than by producing it. Enron sold many of its ge=
nerating plants and became the biggest "power broker" in the nation.=20
Though it was by no means the largest winner in the con game that bilked Ca=
lifornia consumers of tens of billions of dollars, Enron was one of the fir=
st power barons to take advantage of California's flawed deregulation law -=
- virtually written by in-state and out-of- state utility companies.=20
The California fiasco soured (probably) most Americans on utility deregulat=
ion, but Enron was not singled out for calumny, and management saw no reaso=
n to examine its business ethics.=20
Contrarywise. management had visions of even greater profits, which it felt=
 no obligation to share with ordinary stockholders. The chief financial off=
icer and other high-ranking executives set up affiliated or subsidiary part=
nerships which made deals with Enron. I do not understand the details of th=
ese arrangements, but neither do independent accountants, the Securities an=
d Exchange Commission or congressional investigators. It does seem clear th=
at the Enron insiders made millions for themselves.=20
Enron acknowledges, without explaining, that stockholder equity dropped $1.=
2 billion in the last quarter and that it had for the last five years overs=
tated profits by some $600 million. Whether this was by design or by mistak=
e is in dispute, but it is the sort of thing which tends to undermine the c=
onfidence of investors.=20
So much for greed. Back to hubris. It seems not unlikely that Enron's leade=
rs felt they might not be punished for a modest amount of corner-cutting be=
cause they had friends in high places.=20
The chief executive, Kenneth L. Lay, was and is a personal friend of George=
 W. Bush and has easy access to the White House. For many months after the =
new administration took office, Karl Rove, Bush's top political strategist,=
 owned Enron stock valued at $100,000 to $250,000, and sold it only after h=
e had been able to secure a ruling that he did not have to pay capital gain=
s tax immediately because he sold to avoid a conflict of interest. Lawrence=
 Lindsey, the president's chief economic coordinator, and I. Lewis Libby, V=
ice President Cheney's chief of staff, owned stock in Enron, and Lindsey wa=
s paid $50,000 last year as a consultant for Enron.=20
Enron and its employees gave more than anyone else to Bush's four political=
 campaigns -- one (unsuccessful) for Congress, two for governor and one for=
 president. In 2000, Enron and its employees gave $113,000 to Bush's campai=
gn, $250,000 to the Republican National Committee, and $300,000 to the Pres=
idential Inauguration Committee.=20
Cabinet appointments affecting energy policy, key sub-Cabinet appointments,=
 administration action or inaction in the California energy mess, and the o=
verall energy policy of the administration could hardly have been more favo=
rable to the interests of Enron.=20
And now a couple of questions: Is it possible the unusual financial maneuve=
rs by Enron went unnoticed or even unsuspected by all the savvy Texas oilme=
n in the Bush administration? Were those of them with heavy investments in =
Enron unconcerned about the conduct of the company? Was Enron right in thin=
king its friends in government would not be in a hurry to investigate or to=
 reprimand?=20
Or, in light of our preoccupation with terrorism, will the Enron case get m=
uch attention from the federal government? Or from voters?=20

Counting Blessings Along With the Losses

Try finishing this sentence: "The best thing about my experience as an inve=
stor in 2001 was ... "=20
Many Americans, contemplating the losses they've suffered this year in the =
stock market, might say there was nothing "best" about what happened to the=
m--in fact, nothing good at all, perhaps other than that it might have been=
 worse.
With share prices on the rise again, the damage to portfolios has been less=
ened. Even so, stocks will have to post strong gains in the next six weeks =
to keep this from being the market's worst calendar year since 1977.=20
The blue-chip Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 1.6% last week, but it's sti=
ll down 13.8% year to date.=20
Yet those losses, while certainly not trivial (especially when they're your=
s), can obscure what arguably are some very positive aspects of this year's=
 experiences.=20
With investing, adversity can be a more important teacher than success. If =
you're having trouble this Thanksgiving week finding reasons to be thankful=
 about anything investment-related, try these on for size:=20
* "Asset allocation" is no longer just a quaint theory. The paramount inves=
ting rule has always been to spread your money around to reduce risk. But i=
t took the worst stock bear market in 25 years to bring this lesson home fo=
r many people who thought equities only rose in value.=20
Now, millions of investors have a far better appreciation for just how much=
 they can lose in stocks--and how bonds and short-term cash savings can off=
set market losses and preserve capital.=20
It has been a hard lesson, to be sure. But investors who take asset allocat=
ion to heart will be laying a much more solid foundation for their money in=
 the long run. And don't underestimate what that can mean for your peace of=
 mind long term.=20
* The wisdom of saving money on a regular basis has been relearned. In the =
late 1990s, many economists lamented how the U.S. savings rate continued to=
 shrink. Some people felt there was little need to put significant new sums=
 into savings when the stocks or stock mutual funds they owned seemed to be=
 rising nonstop.=20
In other words, many Americans were letting the stock market do their savin=
g for them when share prices were rising 20% or more each year.=20
Now, with shares down and with the likelihood of much more moderate returns=
 on stocks in this decade, it's clear that many people will have to find a =
way to save regularly if they're going to meet their long-term financial go=
als, especially retirement.=20
This may not be a pleasant reality, but it's better for most people to have=
 faced this fact sooner rather than later, while there may be time to make =
up lost ground.=20
* A healthy skepticism has replaced mindless euphoria about stocks and thos=
e who tout them. The market's slide has discredited a legion of Wall Street=
 analysts, money managers and others whose knowledge, understanding and jud=
gment were clearly lacking, in retrospect.=20
Investors have come to see that having blind faith in those who present the=
mselves as "experts" is a highly dangerous strategy, if it can be called a =
strategy at all.=20
Sure, it may have been more fun when technology stocks were shooting the mo=
on and nobody had much use for reviewing a company's fundamentals. But that=
 wasn't investing--it was speculating, and on a massive, and ultimately rui=
nous, scale.=20
People have learned to be less trusting about what others say about the mar=
ket, and that is more likely to be beneficial than detrimental to their por=
tfolios in the long run.=20
Just ask anyone who shifted their entire 401(k) retirement savings sum into=
 aggressive-growth mutual funds in the first quarter of 2000--right before =
the market peaked--because of the bullish comments of some 25-year-old tech=
 stock analyst. Those investors aren't likely to make a move like that agai=
n.=20
* Free-market forces are weeding out the weak players and the phonies. Capi=
talism may be harsh, but it's efficient when the good times end and it's ti=
me to find out which companies truly have talent and staying power--and des=
erve more capital.=20
Hundreds of dot-coms have failed, but who really misses them? Is it any har=
der to find what you want on the Internet? It probably would have been much=
 worse for all concerned if those companies had sucked up investors' funds =
for another year instead of failing when they did.=20
But the market isn't just eliminating small companies that never had much o=
f a future. The financial near-collapse of energy giant Enron Corp. exposed=
 a business that twisted accounting rules to its own benefit--to the point =
that the company now concedes that financial statements all the way back to=
 1997 "should not be relied upon."=20
Also to be weeded out, though over a longer time period, will be mutual fun=
d managers whose performance running other peoples' money has been a nightm=
are for those investors--meaning, the returns produced have been far worse =
than what the investors would have achieved in the average fund in that par=
ticular sector.=20
These managers know who they are--and, hopefully, their shareholders know b=
y now as well, and will vote with their feet.=20
The free market also is reminding cartels just how tough it is to control p=
rices.=20
Once again, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has lost its =
ability to prop up crude oil prices, which have sunk to two-year lows amid =
the weak global economy. That's lousy for OPEC, but it's great for every en=
ergy consumer.=20
* The market's woes have altered many investors' priorities for the better.=
 The wild bull market of the late 1990s demanded peoples' attention, and go=
t it.=20
For some, stocks became an obsession. Their portfolios dominated their live=
s, especially if they were actively trading shares. They believed they were=
 going to be rich, or richer, and that it was all because of how smart they=
 were.=20
Now, most people have been humbled by the market. In the process, some have=
 realized that they don't want their mood determined by their portfolio's d=
ay-to-date price changes.=20
The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, of course, also changed many peoples' view =
of what truly matters to them.=20
Money is important, but you aren't your stocks, and they aren't you. Life i=

INVESTING James K. Glassman
Don't Be A Pudd'n'head, Diversify
James K. Glassman

11/18/2001
The Washington Post
FINAL
H01
Copyright 2001, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved

Warren Buffett, who was probably the greatest investor of the 20th century,=
 is fond of quoting the salacious actress Mae West as saying, "Too much of =
a good thing can be wonderful." In the market, such a motto would lead you =
to avoid diversification and instead concentrate your portfolio in stocks y=
ou really, really like.=20
Peter Lynch, who was probably the best mutual fund manager of the 20th cent=
ury, calls spreading yourself too thin "diworseification."
Smart, witty and brilliant at picking stocks, Buffett and Lynch may not nee=
d diversification, but the rest of us do. When you own one stock, you're ou=
t on a limb. For example, very few analysts -- with or without a conflict o=
f interest -- predicted that shares of Enron, the energy and trading compan=
y, would tumble by 90 percent in a year. Put all your eggs in a basket like=
 that and you end up with a gooey mess. The more stocks you own -- as long =
as they are in different industries -- the more the overall riskiness of yo=
ur portfolio is modulated.=20
The reason you don't want a super-risky portfolio is simple: While Warren B=
uffett may be calm and prescient enough to ride out severe dips in the valu=
e of his holdings, most investors are not. A portfolio that increases in pr=
ice by 10 percent each and every year is worth exactly the same at the end =
of three years as a portfolio that falls by half the first year, rises by t=
hree-quarters the second and rises by 52 percent the third. But reasonable =
investors prefer the consistent ride. It prevents them from doing something=
 stupid, such as selling all their stocks after losing half their money dur=
ing that first disastrous year.=20
Consider the sad case of James D. McCall, who earlier this month resigned a=
s manager of the Merrill Lynch Focus Twenty mutual fund. Two years ago, Mer=
rill wanted McCall's services so desperately that the firm went to court to=
 pry McCall away from his previous employer, Pilgrim Baxter, where he rang =
up impressive gains in the late 1990s. (His big success was called PBHG Lar=
ge Cap 20.) And when they got McCall, Merrill's brokers raised more than $1=
.5 billion from their clients for him to invest. While the average growth-s=
tock mutual fund owns about 100 stocks, with the top 10 holdings representi=
ng about one-fourth of the portfolio's total value, McCall specialized in w=
hat are called "concentrated portfolios." In the case of Merrill Lynch Focu=
s Twenty, he owned, as the name implies, just 20 stocks. At last report, hi=
s top 10 holdings accounted for a whopping two-thirds of the fund's assets.=
=20
If McCall had spread his 20 stocks among, say, a dozen different industries=
, he might have smoothed his ride. Instead, 69 percent of his assets went t=
o technology firms. The Focus fund and a smaller one that McCall ran called=
 Premier Growth were launched in March 2000. Within just 17 months, all but=
 $650 million of the clients' original $1.5 billion had vanished.=20
It is hard to imagine losing as much as Focus Twenty did even if you tried.=
 As of Nov. 9, the week McCall resigned, the fund was down 72 percent for t=
he year, compared with a loss of 14 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500-s=
tock index, the benchmark for fund managers. According to the latest report=
 from Morningstar Mutual Funds, 19 of McCall's 20 stocks had declined durin=
g 2001, the only exception being Harley-Davidson. More amazing, 16 of the 1=
9 losers had fallen by at least half. (By the way, Enron was McCall's seven=
th-largest holding.)=20
"This fund has had a wretched existence," wrote Morningstar analyst Kunal K=
apoor, who did admit a grudging admiration for McCall's perseverance. McCal=
l's "faith may turn out to be well placed over time," Kapoor said. Unfortun=
ately, time ran out.=20
My point here is not to pick on McCall but to reveal the perils of concentr=
ation. Buying Focus Twenty as a technology fund, and consigning it to no mo=
re than one-fifth of your holdings (with the rest of your assets in diversi=
fied, conventional stocks or funds) might have made sense, but Focus Twenty=
 was touted as a "long-term capital appreciation" fund, not a sector fund. =
Here, it failed, but maybe it didn't have to.=20
The manager who made the concentrated fund popular, Tom Marsico, who ran Ja=
nus Twenty, took care to spread his holdings around. His successor, Scott S=
choelzel, has suffered losses lately (he is down 28 percent year-to-date, b=
ut that's after a total gain of 546 percent in the preceding five years), b=
ut they have not been nearly so catastrophic -- and for good reason. Schoel=
zel's last report lists among his top 10 holdings three tech stocks, two fi=
nancials, one drug company, one energy firm (whoops, Enron again), one indu=
strial, one consumer-durables company and one services firm.=20
For investors in individual stocks, the important question is this: How muc=
h diversification is enough? Some risk is inherent in even the broadest por=
tfolio. This is called market, or "systematic," risk. Over the past 75 year=
s, market risk, as measured in standard deviation, has been about 20 percen=
t. In other words, in two-thirds of the years the annual return of the S&P =
has fallen into a band ranging from 20 points lower to 20 points higher tha=
n its average return of 11 percent; that is, between a loss of 9 percent an=
d a gain of 31 percent. That's still volatile, but if you invest in stocks =
you have to live with it.=20
What you don't have to live with is anything more volatile. So your objecti=
ve in building a portfolio is to try to approximate systematic risk and avo=
id what is called "idiosyncratic," or extra, risk. A portfolio with just a =
few stocks, or one like McCall's, that is overloaded in a single sector, ha=
s lots of idiosyncratic risk. In 1977, an influential study found that inve=
stors could nearly eliminate that extra risk by owning just 20 stocks in a =
wide variety of sectors; in fact, owning eight or 10 stocks depressed risk =
sharply.=20
Recently, however, the market has appeared to be far more volatile, and a n=
ew study by a group of economists headed by John Campbell of Harvard found =
that many more stocks were needed -- around 50 -- to bring a portfolio down=
 to the same level of riskiness as the broad market. What Campbell's group =
found was that neither the market itself nor individual sectors had become =
more volatile in the 1990s, but that stocks within those sectors had, so yo=
u need to own more of them.=20
But owning 50 stocks is a pain in the neck -- and it brings up the Buffett-=
Lynch admonitions about too much diversification. It is hard just to take t=
he time to make the selections, but even buy-and-hold investors need to kee=
p track of the companies they own to spot adverse changes in management, pr=
oduct failures or new competition (not to mention Enron-style accounting sh=
enanigans) -- signs that it's time to sell.=20
One good answer is to achieve balance by owning a combination of mutual fun=
ds and stocks. For example, you might want to put 50 percent of the money y=
ou have allotted for stocks into a fund that mimics the S&P itself, like Va=
nguard Index 500, which charges rock-bottom expenses and guarantees that ri=
sk won't exceed systematic levels. You could also consider a broad fund tha=
t's managed by human beings, such as Meridian Value or Baron Growth, which =
are recommended by Sheldon Jacobs, editor of the No-Load Fund Investor news=
letter. Then another 25 percent of your holdings can go into a few sector f=
unds that specialize in technology, real estate, energy and small-caps, and=
 the final 25 percent into a portfolio of 10 to 20 individual stocks. (I ow=
n 16, at last count.)=20
There are many valid variations. Just don't emulate Mark Twain.=20
In a letter to clients recently, Anthony M. Maramarco of David L. Babson & =
Co., the Cambridge, Mass., investment firm, recalled the aphorism of Twain'=
s Pudd'n'head Wilson: "Put all your eggs in the one basket -- and watch tha=
t basket!" Unfortunately, such a philosophy emphatically does not work in s=
tock investing -- as Twain himself learned when he sank nearly all his fort=
une into the Paige Linotype, a machine that flopped.=20
We all make mistakes. (It was Twain, after all, who pointed out that "human=
 beings are the only animals that blush -- or need to.") But smart diversif=
ication helps investors avoid some of the worst of them.=20

Wessex Water `to be sold'

(Copyright 2001 Independent Newspapers (UK) Limited)

Wessex Water, the water and sewage company, is understood to be up for sale=
 following an offer to take over its owner, Enron, by Dynegy, the US energy=
 group.=20
Three years ago, Enron spent pounds 1.4bn on Wessex Water. But Dynegy is un=
derstood to want to concentrate on US and European energy assets and is not=
 interested in non-core assets.
Any hope to regain the same amount of money could be derailed as the indust=
ry is put off by regulatory problems, and the company's results have worsen=
ed due to imposed price cuts over the past year.=20
"It is not that there is going to be a fire sale but most of [the internati=
onal assets] are not core to the businesses we will continue to pursue," sa=
id an Enron spokesperson. "At the right price we will sell."=20
Scottish & Southern Energy and United Utilities have been touted as potenti=
al buyers, yet industry insiders believe that the UK regulator, Ofwat, will=
 take a dim view of bids by UK water companies, as they are too large to bu=

Quanta steels itself against takeover bid

(Copyright 2001)

Quanta Services, which builds and maintains power and communications lines,=
 said Friday it is fighting a "creeping takeover" by UtiliCorp United, one =
of the nation's largest utility holding companies.=20
On Thursday Quanta board members changed the Houston company's shareholder =
rights agreement - called a "poison pill" defense against takeovers - to de=
ter UtiliCorp from acquiring a controlling stake.
The action was taken after negotiations with UtiliCorp fell apart and the K=
ansas City, Mo.-based company announced its intention to resume purchases o=
f Quanta stock.=20
A spokesman told Bloomberg News on Oct. 4 that UtiliCorp wanted to increase=
 its stake to the mid-40s percentage range, which would give it effective c=
ontrol, with a vote on management.=20
UtiliCorp invested $320 million in Quanta from September of 1999 through Fe=
bruary of 2000, said UtiliCorp spokesman Ethan Hirsh, bringing its ownershi=
p up to 28 percent, and has been adding stock since then. It owned about 38=
 percent when a standstill agreement stopped further purchases in early Oct=
ober.=20
Part of the shareholder rights amendment limits further purchases by Quanta=
 by reducing the trigger point for the poison pill to 39 percent of Quanta'=
s outstanding shares, instead of the 49.9 percent that has been in effect j=
ust for UtiliCorp.=20
In addition to saying that UtiliCorp is no longer "an exempt" person under =
the 39 percent trigger, the amendments changed the kind of securities to be=
 issued in the event the pill is triggered and how they could be exercised.=
=20
UtiliCorp had a higher trigger point that other potential acquirers because=
 it already was a significant shareholder when the plan was initially draft=
ed.=20
Hirsch didn't think the amendments would prevent his company from buying mo=
re.=20
UtiliCorp's interest in Houston acquisitions is not limited to Quanta. Its =
also said this week it would like to buy Enron's share of a United Kingdom =
power station that provides electricity sufficient to light 1.88 million ho=
mes.=20
It will soon get a 27 percent share in the station near London, known as th=
e Teeside power station,through the purchase of a utility there. It would l=
ike the 42.5 percent that Enron owns, UtiliCorp President Robert Green said=
 in a conference call.=20
Green said he understood that stake was on Enron's for-sale list.=20
UtiliCorp revealed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that it b=
ought 1.538 million shares of Quanta's common stock on the open market, at =
a cost of more than $24 million, between Sept. 28 and Oct. 3.=20
Quanta's stock declined 27 cents to close Friday at $15.69, while UtiliCorp=
 rose 10 cents to close at $27.50. Quanta's stock is down 51 percent for th=
e year to date, and hit a 52-week low of $9.94 on Sept. 21.=20
"After many weeks of negotiations with UtiliCorp, we could not reach agreem=
ent upon a strategy that would allow UtiliCorp to consolidate our financial=
 results for accounting purposes on terms acceptable to Quanta," John Colso=
n, Quanta's chief executive officer, said in a written statement.=20
"In the face of UtiliCorp's communications last evening breaking off negoti=
ations and stating its intent to resume open market purchases of Quanta sto=
ck, the board acted to protect the best interests of all Quanta stockholder=
s against a change of control transaction which did not provide an appropri=
ate benefit to all shareholders," he said.=20
Quanta has a mutually beneficial relationship with UtiliCorp and hopes nego=
tiations can resume, Colson said.

AT ENRON, THE BIG DOGS ATE FIRST

11/17/2001
Portland Oregonian
SUNRISE

(Copyright (c) The Oregonian 2001)

Summary: Workers' ire over 401(k) plans is understandable=20
Watching Enron's bigwigs lose their jobs after inflating profits may offer =
some satisfaction to retirees and employees at the troubled energy marketer=
. But don't bank on it.
When corporate insiders can sell the company and stroll away with millions =
while workers and other stockholders are left with peanuts, it would be har=
d not to be bitter.=20
As Oregonian business writer Jeff Manning reported Friday, local employees =
of Portland General Electric, an Enron subsidiary, watched their retirement=
 savings sink after Enron announced on Oct. 16 that it would lose $618 mill=
ion in the fourth quarter. This came after Enron officers made more than $1=
36 million selling stocks earlier in the year.=20
Then on Nov. 8, Enron dropped the other shoe: It admitted it had overstated=
 earnings for four years by $586 million, or 20 percent. Over those few wee=
ks, Enron shares plunged from $33.84 to its $9 close on Friday.=20
The four-year overstatement developed through some novel accounting methods=
. Enron and its auditor, Arthur Anderson, insist that its financial reports=
 were all within proper standards, but the mechanics in this case included =
obscuring debt by placing it on the ledgers of other entities so that the p=
arent company's profit picture appeared rosier than it actually was.=20
The weeks from mid-October to early November were wrenching for employees. =
Because the company was changing its fund manager, they were powerless to m=
ake any changes in their 401(k) plans. PGE chief executive Peggy Fowler poi=
nts out that the change in 401(k) plan managers was announced last summer. =
And although employees could have gotten out of Enron stocks over the histo=
ry of the plan, Enron seemed to be an attractive investment.=20
Company executives, though, were selling. Jeffrey Skilling, who was promote=
d to Enron chief executive early in the year but resigned in August, sold m=
ore than $5 million in company shares according to transaction records cove=
ring the first half of the year.=20
Former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, who was fired last month in =
an action related to the financial mess, made $14 million in stock sales be=
tweeen March and November of last year. Kenneth Lay, Enron's chief executiv=
e, who returned after his protege Skilling left, made at least $20 million =
in stock sales from late last year. He has announced that he would decline =
his severance package.=20
Dynegy, another Texas energy marketing company, has made a bid to buy Enron=
. That probably means the best Enron and PGE employees can hope for now is =
that Dynegy will be a better corporate owner, or they can try their luck wi=
th one of the many shareholder lawsuits being filed.=20
The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Enron's activities.=
 If its behavior was illegal, there will be consequences for company office=
rs.=20
That's still not much to offer to workers who have seen their retirement sa=
vings dissolve. But for now it's all there is.

FINANCE WEEK - From dealing to reeling.
By BARRY RILEY.

11/17/2001
Financial Times
(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved

FINANCE WEEK - From dealing to reeling - The legacy of the late 1990s stock=
 market bubble remains with us, as does irrationality THE LONG VIEW - BARRY=
 RILEY.=20
Optimism is back. Stock markets around the globe have typically rallied by =
20 per cent since rock bottom was reached on September 21. Only 9 per cent =
of global fund managers believe equities will be lower in 12 months, accord=
ing to a Merrill Lynch survey published this week.
But the legacy of the late 1990s stock market bubble remains with us. The c=
hallenge is how to minimise the level of irrationality. Two of the UK's big=
gest losers from crazy prices reported on Tuesday. Vodafone suffered #11.45=
bn of write-downs - but curiously, made no provisions against the sky-high =
#13.1bn it paid for third-generation mobile phone licences in 2000.=20
Such payments, argued Sir Christopher Gent, Voda-fone's chief executive, we=
re merely what the market demanded at the time. It is interesting to note, =
too, that Paul Klemperer, the Oxford professor who is an expert in "auction=
 theory" and advised the British government, has defended the disastrous ou=
tcome by arguing that the prices reflected the capital market's view of 3G'=
s prospects. The common theme here is that it is nobody's fault if crazy pr=
ices are paid, because they are legitimised by the stock market.=20
Marconi, which is financially in a much worse state than the mobile phone g=
iant, has written off most of the #4.1bn paid for US internet hardware comp=
anies in 1999. There has also been a great deal of controversy in the US du=
ring the past few weeks over the near-collapse of Enron, the power group be=
ing rescued by a takeover bid from its smaller rival Dynegy. There was an o=
bvious failure by investors - and by stock market analysts - to assess the =
true risks at Enron.=20
Smart businessmen will sellat mad prices, but why on earth should they buy?=
 The trouble is, too many academics have developed theories of value based =
on rational expectations. The real world is unfortunately very different.=
=20
Some of the distortions had obvious technical origins. The Vodafone bubble =
of 1999 reflected the cross-border takeover of Mannesmann and the artificia=
l weighting shortages that developed from that transaction as Vodafone ball=
ooned in market capitalisation to reach, at one stage, 16 per cent of the F=
TSE 100 Index. The market price was driven not by normal corporate fundamen=
tals, but by the desire of most fund managers to reach a market weighting, =
at which point they were "safe" in terms of risk against the index benchmar=
k.=20
That was the period when investment banks exploited the idea of low free-fl=
oat new issues: internet companies, especially, were floated off with only =
15 per cent of the stock made available, although anything up to 100 per ce=
nt went into the indices, creating serious shortages and bubble valuations.=
 Changes now being made to the main stock market indices have reduced the p=
roblem, but there remains a basic irrationality in the concept that investm=
ent risk resides in an index rather than in the underlying stocks.=20
Takeovers have always been plagued by irrationality, and indeed this is an =
area where academics recognise the problem; over many years they have point=
ed out that all the benefits of deals, and often more than all, accrue to t=
he shareholders of the companies taken over, while investors in the bidding=
 companies suffer dilution. Investors know this, and in normal market condi=
tions news of a takeover will depress the bidder's share price. But in a bu=
bble market these prudent attitudes can be overwhelmed by euphoria, as well=
 as technical factors relating to demand by fund managers so that they can =
maintain their weightings when a bidder is spraying around large quantities=
 of new equity.=20
Also, it is irrational that many more deals are done when the stock market =
is high than when it is low. Two years ago, companies such as Marconi were =
engaged in buying sprees at daft prices. Now, when prices are much lower, h=
ardly any acquisitions are being made (and investment banks are dismissing =
thousands of employees). An exception to the deal famine is gold mining, wh=
ich just happens to have been one of the stock market's strongest sectors t=
his year.=20
Another important source of irrationality has been the domination of stock =
market analysis by the stockbroking offshoots of the investment banks. Over=
 recent years their earnings-per-share forecasts for the next calendar year=
 have been on average 8 per cent too high. This has not just been a mistake=
; they have been paid to be over-optimistic. Admittedly, attempts are being=
 made to restructure the incentives here, as the embarrassed investment ban=
ks come under pressure from the regulators and the courts for their errors =
of judgment during the bull market, but it remains to be seen whether much =
will really change.=20

 many professional investors do not. That Merrill survey, incidentally, sho=
ws that fund managers on average expect no more than 4 per cent earnings pe=
r share growth over the next year, while the stockbrokers' analysts are sti=
ll clinging to the hope that it will be 15 per cent.=20
A final source of distortion is the tendency of companies to offer their ex=
ecutives the wrong sort of incentives. The ruin of Marconi may appear irrat=
ional, when multi-billion-pound acquisitions are being declared worthless a=

 shareholders, or employees, would consider acceptable.=20
Moreover, Sir Christopher Gent, shareholders of Vodafone will remember, rec=
eived a controversial #10m personal bonus last year for clinching the Manne=
smann takeover, a deal that requires #10bn of write-offs.=20
In normal market conditions the valuation of equities may be tolerably rati=
onal, but in a bubble market the rules are thrown out of the window. Many i=
nvestors certainly like the idea of getting rich quickly. That is why many =
people subscribe so keenly to national lotteries in which the chance of win=
ning is so small as to be not worth rational consideration.=20

Enron Investors Hope Filing Will Shed More Light on Finances

Enron Investors Hope Filing Will Shed More Light on Finances

     Houston, Nov. 17 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. investors hope
the energy trader's third-quarter report to the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission will answer some of the questions that
sent its shares tumbling and led to a proposed sale to rival
Dynegy Inc.

     Enron, which has been criticized for failing to clearly
explain how it makes money, may disclose in Monday's filing more
on how much is owed by the company and affiliated partnerships, as
well as any planned job cuts and other cost-saving moves related
to Dynegy's $24 billion buyout.

     ``Investors will be looking for anything that affects the
likelihood of the (Dynegy) deal going through and the timing of
such a deal,'' said Edward Paik, who helps manage the Liberty
Utilities Fund, which owns 1.6 million in Enron shares.

     Enron agreed to sell after its stock plunged 67 percent in
three weeks amid an SEC investigation into partnerships run by
Enron executives. Investors worry that new disclosures, such as
previously unreported debt, might threaten Enron's credit rating
and scuttle the merger, possibly pushing Enron into bankruptcy.

     ``There's been so much skepticism about what Enron's
liabilities are with these partnerships, I'm looking to quantify
this,'' said Glen Hilton, a fund manager at Montgomery Asset
Management LP, which holds Dynegy shares.

     Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay admitted last week that failed
investments and a loss of investor confidence forced the sale to
Dynegy, and he and other executives pledged to be more open with
investors. Lay, 59, said last week he won't accept a severance
package of more than $60 million that he could have collected
following the takeover.

     Enron shares fell 48 cents yesterday to $9. Dynegy fell
$1.53, or 3.5 percent, to $42.47.

                           Balance Sheet

     Enron's third-quarter report, which had been expected last
week, was delayed by the Dynegy talks and a restatement of
earnings, Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon said. Enron
reduced net income for four years by a combined $586 million to
include losses from affiliated partnerships.

     Monday's filing, called a 10-Q, will include a balance sheet
summarizing assets and debts. Enron for years has omitted balance
sheets, which the SEC requires as part of the 10-Q, from its press
releases announcing earnings.

     Investors renewed their criticisms of the practice after Lay
mentioned during a conference call last month that dealings with
two partnerships had reduced Enron's shareholder equity, or its
assets minus liabilities, by $1.2 billion. The disclosure led to
the ouster of Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow.

     ``Everyone is trying to make their own assessment of what
(Enron's) ultimate liability will need to be,'' said Commerzbank
Securities analyst Andre Meade, who rates the shares ``hold'' and
doesn't own them.

     Monday's report probably won't give a complete answer, said
Louis Gagliardi, an analyst at John S. Herold Inc. While the
balance sheet will list liabilities for the partnerships, which
were set up to buy Enron assets and get debt off the company's
books, it won't spell out Enron's share, he said.

     ``What is the net liability off the balance sheet?''
Gagliardi said. ``We really don't know what that number is.''

                           Credit Rating

     Dynegy has said it can back out of the acquisition if Enron's
legal liabilities exceed $3.5 billion. The balance sheet ``will
help us see how good a deal this is for Dynegy,'' said Kathleen
Vuchetich, co-manager of the $1.4 billion Strong American
Utilities Fund, which owns 284,000 Dynegy shares.

     Both companies are based in Houston.

     The filing also might offer details on the SEC probe. ``It
may say what the SEC is looking for, and what the rating agencies
have told them,'' said Christopher Ellinghaus, an analyst at
Williams Capital Group. He added, though, ``I don't expect much.''

     Enron's stock drop led Moody's Investors Service to cut the
company's debt rating to the lowest investment grade. Dynegy held
off on a purchase agreement out of concern that the rating would
be cut to junk, jeopardizing Enron's ability to raise cash needed
to settle its daily power and natural-gas trades.

     Enron may reveal where it expects to cut jobs and how much it
will pay to departing employees, Paik said. Chief Operating
Officer Greg Whalley said last week that fourth-quarter profit
will be hurt by severance payments and reorganization costs. He
didn't give details.

     Jobs likely will be eliminated in businesses the company
plans to sell, including its money-losing telecommunications unit
and operations in Europe, analysts said.

     Enron has about 21,000 employees, two-thirds in the U.S. and
about a fifth in the U.K. Its 600 traders are divided between
London and Houston, where Enron employs about 7,500.

     Many Enron workers are already preparing for layoffs, said
Lyndon Taylor, a Houston-based recruiter for Heidrick & Struggles
International Inc., an executive placement firm.

     ``I got 56 resumes last week from Enron,'' Taylor said.
``That's equal to the number I got in the past year.''

The cost of living is lower in Calgary than in many comparable U.S. cities.=

WestLB Offers to Buy Enron's U.K. Water Unit, Newspaper Says
2001-11-17 20:01 (New York)


     London, Nov. 18 (Bloomberg) -- Westdeutsche Landesbank
Girozentrale, Germany's largest state-owned bank, is one of
several suitors talking to Enron Corp. about its Wessex Water
unit, which is valued at more than 1 billion pounds ($1.4
billion), the Sunday Telegraph said without citing sources.

     Dynegy Inc. of the U.S. is looking to buy Enron for $24
billion, and will sell some of its assets, including Wessex.
WestLB made a formal offer to Enron in the past few days in hopes
of striking a quick deal because Dynegy may want to avoid the
regulatory risk in such a sale; any bid for a water company in the
U.K. worth at least 30 million pounds must be referred to the
Competition Commission, the newspaper said.

     Enron bought Wessex for 1.4 billion pounds in 1998. RWE AG of
Germany, Europe's fourth-biggest power company, is also interested
in Wessex, but Enron thinks U.K. regulators won't approve an RWE
bid because the company already owns Thames Water, a large U.K.
water company.

     WestLB has also been reported to be preparing a buyout for
Railtrack Group Plc, the insolvent owner of the U.K.'s train
tracks and stations, the paper said.


Enron Closes on $550 Million Loan From J.P. Morgan, Salomon
2001-11-16 17:36 (New York)

Enron Closes on $550 Million Loan From J.P. Morgan, Salomon

     Houston, Nov. 16 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. closed Wednesday
on a $550 million loan from J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Salomon
Smith Barney Inc. that was secured with assets of its Transwestern
Pipeline Co., spokesman Vance Meyer said.

     Enron, the largest energy trader, said Nov. 1 that it had
received a commitment for $1 billion in loans from the investment
banks that would be used for debt payments and to supplement cash
reserves.

     Enron secured the loans with the assets of Transwestern and
the Northern Natural Gas Co. The two pipeline systems combined are
about 19,000 miles long and can deliver as much as 6 billion cubic
feet of gas a day. The remaining $450 million loan, secured with
the Northern Natural Gas assets, is in the documentation stage and
is expected to close next week, Meyer said.

     Enron agreed a week ago to be acquired by Dynegy Inc. in a
transaction now valued at $24.7 billion in stock and assumed debt.
The move followed a loss in investor confidence -- the company's
shares had fallen 90 percent this year -- and amid a federal
investigation of accounting irregularities that limited its
ability to finance operations.

     ChevronTexaco Corp., the second-biggest U.S. oil company and
Dynegy's largest shareholder with 26 percent, provided Enron,
through Dynegy, with a $1.5 billion cash infusion on Tuesday as
part of the buyout agreement.

     In return, Dynegy acquired preferred stock and other rights
in the Enron unit that owns Northern Natural Gas. If the merger
isn't completed, Dynegy will have the right to acquire Northern
Natural Gas, Enron said in regulatory filing Wednesday.
ChevronTexaco will provide Dynegy with another $1 billion after
the merger closes to maintain its equity stake.

     The shares of Enron fell 48 cents to $9, while shares of
Dynegy fell $1.53 to $42.47. Both companies are based in Houston.
Shares of San Francisco-based ChevronTexaco fell 35 cents to
$83.45.

Equiva is looking for a $1,588,860 pre-payment on Wednesday, 11/21 to cover an MTBE cargo in NYH.  They will not consider any open credit and since we have already pre-paid them for crude in December our argument is falling on deaf ears.

Jeff:

I was a sincere pleasure speaking to you today and I hope that I can help you find some good people.

As we discussed, please find attached a very good options trader that would consider a move to Houston.  He is very sharp and could be a real asset to your group.

Please advise if you would like to schedule an interview. Note: He is only trading a VAR of $500-600K and could do a lot more.

This is a friend of mine who is an absolute knockout.  She is also a friend of Karen Sussman's, who I understand you know also.  Karen is married to Harry Sussman.  The girl's name is Natalie Newburn, she is 28 and a twelve on a scale of ten.  I spoke with her earlier and she is expecting your call.  Her number is:  713 408-8331.  Call her, you won't be disappointed.  Let's try and play golf sometime soon.  Maybe this weekend.

We arranged to buy the coal on a CIF basis instead of FOB - problem solved - no additional cash requirement needed.

Good morning Jeff/Wayne

The Enron International coal group are having major issues with our key Colombian coal supplier, Drummond (us based company)- fax attached. George has asked me to send this to you.

Situation

They supply us on a regular basis one cape and three panamax's of coal a month with the contract finishing by July 2002. Cost of the coal for the cape is 28.00 usd per metric tonne basis 11,300 btu/lb gar and the cost of the panamax's is 28.25 usd per metric tonne basis 11,350 btu/lb gar. (gar means gross as received). 

In the contract we have 15 days payment terms such that we pay for the coal 15 days after completion of loading of the vessel. Unfortunately they are refusing to load any vessels at present unless we load cash up front. They will compensate usd for the early payment in reduced price however I realise this is scant consolation. In most circumstance We would sue these guys however the implications associated with not loading the coal and going to court are the following=

coal purchase price 28.00       usd  per mt Lump sum cash required 4.424 mill usd.
freight costs             3.75       usd  per mt
sales price             37.45       usd  per mt
deal cash flow          5.70       usd  per mt

tonnage 158,000 metric tonnes

======================
               900,600 usd     
======================


This deal in typical circumstances is credit enhancing. The customer pays in 11 days and we only payout in 15 days. If we don't load the vessel our customer will default, the market will know and Enron's franchise/credibility in the coal is gone. On the follow on vessels we should be having similar type cash flows.

We have the following vessels loading in the next two months.

Nov  20- 24 one cape 158,000 mt above vessel loading at present completing on the 24th Nov
Nov  24- 26 one pmax 63,000  mt loading 24th Nov completing 26th Nov
Nov  23- 31 one pmax 70,000  mt no eta  26 th nov completing 28th Nov
Dec   3-12  one cape 148,000 mt
Dec  14-23 one pmax 70,000  mt
Dec  26- 4 jan   pmax 63,000  mt
Dec  26- 4 jan   pmax 70,000  mt


Solution

What can we do - either raise an L/C or we pay cash up front (4.4 mill)- considering the present vessel is loading and the time it takes to raise an l/c then we think cash upfront for this one is going to be the only present solution. Naturally we are looking at other options which means that we don't have to send cash out of the door- one of the being selling them the freight and then them selling CIF - I will work this direct with their guys in London- but meanwhile I would appreciate you guys help in the interim time before George flies into Houston this morning to see what can be done internally to pay upfront on this first vessel at least.

many thanks in advance

peter

Jeff, 

No action is required on your part at this time. This memo was in response to your question in the weekly EGM staff meeting. 

Iain Greig and Randal Frisbie will be in touch in the next couple of weeks. We would like to set up a meeting to discuss your vision for the next release of Position Manager. New requirements (e.g. - backward cumulative roll) that you mentioned in the demo are already being planned for. 

Ideally, we'd like to install MoneyPenny onto your desk top so that you can use it and help us understand what other things need to be added. 

Thanks.

Jeff, 

Here are a few deliverables that should provide answers to the question you posed on Monday about Thunderball. 

1) The first spreadsheet lists the traders and risk analysts in each office that are involved in user acceptance testing for Position Manager and the schedule for signoff. (User Rollout 626.xls)

2) The second document higlights current overall status for the Moneypenny trading application. (DevStat625.doc)

3) The third document highlights future Position Manager functionality. This is an initial draft that will be confirmed with key traders as well as Todd Hall.  We will then set up a meeting to get your input and review. Note, this includes key requirements that you requested in the system demo such as support for a Cumulative Backward Roll view within Position Manager. (PosMgrR2...)

Let me know if you have further questions. 

Thanks.

Steve leppard has joined our group from a background in IT and research with Enron.  He has had sometime to analyze our group in these areas and wants to recruit some analysts and associates over.   I'm inclined to trust his judgement and take them in if they are to be working on developing our IT systems and var issues.   I'm to discuss this on Monday with Steve and Niamh but want to make you aware we are looking at taking on resources in London in this area.  Please let me know your views.

Chris, Niamh

Following my discussions with Chris last week I'm interested to know the state of play as regards increasing our market analytics efforts (as distinct from quant derivative work).  There are a few people I can recommend if we're looking for resource, and I'd like to know if it might be appropriate to make some subtle queries as to their interest/availability.

In particular I'm interested in obtaining:
Kirstee Hewitt, currently in Research.  Has the best feel for numbers and the most practical view of all things numerical/statistical in Research.  Wants to get more commerical.
Homan Amiry, currently in RAC.  Full of bright ideas, wants to get commercial.  Has already had discussions with Chris, and is available to move any time.
Ted Barlow, currently in Metals.  Relatively new to Enron, good bright Analyst - just point him at a problem and watch him go.

Steve

Mike/Jeff,

The following attached documents are the draft MOU (still rough) and a summary of the document.  We have not yet showed either of these to Sato, but would plan to do so early next week.  We met with Freshfields for 2 hours the other day to get some basic thoughts and to gauge their interest in helping to draft the JV agreement.  They thought our MOU could be more simple and while I don't completely disagree, I'd like to make sure Sato is 90-95% there before we bring their senior guy(s) to Houston.  Regardless, we need to run both of you through where we are today and plans for the next couple of weeks.  I have a meeting and dinner with Nakatani (head of corp planning and guy who would sign MOU tomorrow).  From all indications it looks as though things are still on track.  There still are a number of items still to work out, but some of these might be deliberately left blank in the MOU.

Jeff:  I had traded voice mails with Mike about (among other things) having a conference call at 5:30 pm your Thurs (0730 Friday Tokyo).  I am not sure if this is confirmed, but pls let us know if this works or an alternative time.

Joe

Jeff and Kath:

Well, I did not fair too well this weekend in regard to fundraising for the
desk.  Here is the report:

Gail and Louis Adler declined saying that they loved the desk, think it is
important for the museum etc. but that they did not want to be part of a
group.  They said that if something arose in the furuture that was more
reasonable and that they could do alone that they might be interested in
helping.

Cyvia and Melvyn Wolff also declined.  Cyvia said that they were quite torn
because it made sense due to their furniture connections and how important
the desk is but ultimately they want their fund to grow into something and
if they dedicate it to the desk there will be nothing left.

I am still trying to reach Nina and Michael.

Margaret Skidmore is meeting with Susan Borches from Shell on the 28th so we
may get a sense there.  Maybe we should coordinate a pitch with Margaret
when she gets back.  Perhaps a call to Mr. Miller might be a good idea (?).

That is all for now.  If you have any reports or any new suggestions, please
let me know.

Thanks,
cindi

Dear Jeff,

How are you doing? I hope everything is all right with you. I just came back from Wharton undergrad interview, it was good, we have very strong candidates, and hopefully we can have them as many as possible. It is a pity that you were not there. 

Will you have time to chat a couple of minutes? I need to figure out my career path at Enron and I really need your help. And I will really appreciate it!

Looking forward to speaking to you!

Fitch Puts Enron On Rating Watch Negative
2001-10-25 13:49 (New York)

Fitch Puts Enron On Rating Watch Negative

Fitch-NY-October 25, 2001: Fitch places the following Enron
securities on Rating Watch Negative: senior unsecured debt
`BBB+'; subordinated debt `BBB'; preferred stock `BBB-`;
and commercial paper `F2'. Pipeline subsidiary `A-` rated
senior unsecured debt at Northern Natural Gas Co. and
Transwestern Pipeline Co., are also placed on Rating Watch
Negative.

The rating action primarily relates to the negative capital
market reaction to recent disclosures by the company. The
loss of investor and counterparty confidence, if it
continues, would impair Enron's financial flexibility and
access to capital markets, therefore, impacting its ability
to conduct its business. On Oct. 16, 2001, Enron announced
a $1 billion after-tax charge to earnings to be taken in
the third quarter of 2001 and a reduction of balance sheet
equity by $1.2 billion relating to the unwinding of
structured transactions. Since that time, there have been
several damaging news reports on the company and its
management. More importantly, investors have voiced
concerns. Enron's common stock price has plummeted and
spreads on its debt have widened.

The company has attempted to quell rumors and has publicly
stated that it has adequate liquidity to conduct its
business. Approximately $1.5 billion of unused liquidity is
available under committed bank lines.

An additional concern is that certain structured
transactions of the company including Marlin Water Trust II
and Osprey could unwind. While various sources of repayment
exist, such as the sale or liquidation of underlying
assets, or an equity offering, primary credit support is
derived from the Enron obligation to remarket mandatorily
convertible preferred stock if an amount sufficient to
repay the notes has not been deposited with the trustee 120
days prior to the maturity date or upon a note trigger
event. In the event that the issuance of the preferred
stock yields less than the amount required to redeem the
senior notes in either case, Enron is required to deliver
additional shares. If Enron cannot or does not deliver on
its obligation, then the amount of the deficiency becomes a
payment obligation of Enron, representing a general
unsecured claim. While trigger events include a downgrade
of Enron's senior unsecured debt below investment grade by
one of the major rating agencies in conjunction with
specified declines in Enron's closing stock price over
three consecutive trading days, Enron would have a
forebearance period of 60 days as long as an attempt was
being made to register the shares. The total amount of
Marlin and Osprey debt is approximately $3.2 billion. Enron
has not verified that the underlying assets have adequate
market value to fully pay down the associated debt.

While capital market uncertainties have escalated, Fitch
has no information to indicate that there are any
fundamental problems with Enron's core wholesale, retail,
and pipeline businesses. Fitch expects to be in contact
with the company on a continuing basis to both monitor
ongoing events and address strategic, longer-term issues.


STOCKWATCH Enron higher after dismissing CFO Fastow

10/25/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

NEW YORK (AFX) - Share of Enron were higher in opening trade, after the company dismissed its chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, due to his past involvement in running two partnerships, in which Enron had invested, dealers said. 
At 9.56 am, Enron was up 1.13 usd, or 6.95 pct, at 17.55. The DJIA was down 138.60 points at 9,207.52, the S&P 500 index was down 15.95 pts at 1,069.00 and the Nasdaq composite down 39.02 at 1,692.52.
Enron said it named Jeff McMahon CFO to replace Fastow, after announcing Monday that the Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into the Fastow-related transactions. 
"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO," said chief executive Kenneth Lay in a statement. 
Enron shares have fallen sharply in recent days on concerns over financial transactions made with the two partnerships, LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co-Investment LP, which analysts said could affect future earnings and which have prompted class action suits against the company. 
McMahon, who had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron's Industrial Markets group, had quit his job as treasurer last year, after voicing concerns within the company about Fastow's role in running the two partnerships, according to the Wall Street Journal. 
This morning, Salomon Smith Barney analyst Raymond Niles downgraded Enron to "buy- speculative," from "buy-high risk", to reflect his concerns that "lingering uncertainty over financial practices may begin to impair Enron's commercial operations." 
"This is the least likely outcome, in our view, but one whose likelihood has increased over the last week as questions continue to be asked," he said.

=DJ Concerned Energy Cos Make Few Changes In Enron Dealings
2001-10-25 14:13 (New York)

   By Mark Golden, Kristen McNamara, Jon Kamp and John Edmiston 
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
 
  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Energy trading companies have concerns about the credit
quality of troubled Enron Corp. (ENE), but they have made almost no changes in
policies concerning the top trader of North American power and gas, the
companies said Thursday. 

  The concerns have arisen because Enron, which accounts for about a quarter of
the trade in the country's power and gas markets, has seen its share price fall
by a third this week due to uncertainties about its extremely complex financial
structure. 

  Moody's has put Enron's credit on watch for possible downgrade, and some of
the company's debt is trading like junk bonds in the secondary market this
week. 

  "We have made no changes to our credit policy concerning Enron," said John
Sousa, chief spokesmann for Dynegy Inc. (DYN). "It's business as usual." 

  Williams Cos. (WMB) spokesman Jim Gipson said that his company, too, has made
no changes and has no concerns about Enron's credit. Another Top 10 power and
gas trading company, Aquila (ILA), has also left Enron credit unchanged. 

  Other companies expressed concern, though they've taken little if any action.

  "Like everyone else in the marketplace, we're proceeding with caution," said
Lora Kinner, director of credit for Tractebel Energy Marketing, the North
American subsidiary of the Belgian company Tractebel S.A. 

  Kinner said the company is just looking for more information and doesn't
expect to make any drastic changes. 
 


Calif Guarantees Allow Williams To Book Power Revenues
By Andrew Dowell
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

10/25/2001

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Clarifications by California as to what electricity transactions the state will back enabled Williams Cos. (WMB) to book $180 million in power sales from the previous period as third-quarter revenues, the company said Thursday. 
The revenues came from power Williams sold through the California Independent System Operator, which runs the state's wholesale power market and clears and settles transactions.
The state of California has paid more than $11 billion for power bought directly from suppliers, but has yet to pay for any ISO power since it took over the job of buying power for the state's ailing utilities in mid-January. Two weeks ago, however, the state made clear for the first time which ISO transactions it would back. 
"It's that fact that has allowed us for the first time to recognize dollars from sales to the California ISO," Williams Chief Operating Officer Steven Malcolm said on a conference call Wednesday. 
Williams reported third-quarter net income of $221.3 million on revenues of $2.81 billion, up from $121.1 million on revenues of $2.33 billion in the same period the year before. 
Williams is now in talks with California to secure payment for its ISO sales. The process is complicated by the state's role as guarantor of transactions undertaken on behalf of the utilities, which aren't creditworthy enough to buy power for themselves. The ISO didn't envision third-party guarantors when it set up its settlement process, and state accounting rules require more detailed bills than those sent out by the ISO each month, state power officials have said. 
The state says it has set aside $1.2 billion to cover ISO transactions. 
As reported, suppliers including Williams had charged the state with deliberately muddling the repayment issue to keep power flowing for free. 
Willing To Renegotiate 

Separately, Williams' officers also said the company was willing to discuss reworking its long-term contracts with California, provided the result benefited both parties. 
California Gov. Gray Davis is under heavy fire for having locked the state into contracts running as long as 20 years at prices negotiated at the peak of a market that has since collapsed. 
Both sides could potentially benefit from changes to the length of the term of the contracts or the specifics of power-supply obligations - perhaps freeing up supply that Williams thinks it could get more money for on the spot market, Malcolm said. 
"We're always willing to sit down with a customer," Malcolm said. 
Williams hasn't been approached by the state to renegotiate the contracts, Malcolm said. 
Any attempt by California to force through one-sided changes is unlikely and could backfire for the state by disrupting plans for new power plants, he said. 
"To the extent contracts are changed, financing is going to go away," he said. 
Downplaying Enron Opportunities 

Williams downplayed its ability to capitalize on the recent troubles of market-leader Enron Corp. (ENE), saying it focuses on large, long-term structured deals, not the high-volume, physical-market transactions that Enron dominates, Malcolm said. 
Also, TradeSpark - the Internet-based energy exchange in which Williams is a partner - is limited for now in its ability to expand and take volume from Enron's proprietary system EnronOnline because of the horrific losses operator Cantor Fitzgerald (X.CFZ) suffered in the attacks on the World Trade Center. 
"That's interrupted the rapid growth we were seeing," Williams Chief Executive Keith Bailey said on the call. 
Enron, which accounts for about a quarter of the trade in the country's power and gas markets and which makes a market for those commodities on EnronOnline, has seen its share price fall by a third this week due to uncertainties about its extremely complex financial structure. 
Those concerns have raised questions about the business model of EnronOnline, a platform on which Enron is the counterparty in all trades. Those concerns could eventually boost volume on neutral exchanges like TradeSpark. 
"We continue to believe in the neutral platform that TradeSpark offers," Malcolm said. 
TradeSpark LP was formed by eSpeed Inc. (ESPD), Cantor Fitzgerald (X.CFZ), Shell (RD) unit Coral Energy, Dominion (D), Koch Energy Trading Inc., TXU Corp.'s (TXU) TXU Energy unit and Williams Cos.' Williams Energy Marketing & Trading Co.

Stocks Expected to Open Lower, Hurt By Weak Economic News

10/25/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

A Wall Street Journal Online News Roundup 
Stocks are expected to open with losses Thursday, weighed down by disappointing U.S. economic news and the European Central Bank's decision to leave interest rates unchanged.
About an hour before the New York Stock Exchange opened, futures on the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index were sharply lower, suggesting that the Dow Jones Industrial Average will post a 94-point loss at the opening bell. 
In one of a trio of negative economic reports, the Commerce Department said orders for durable goods, or products expected to last more than three years, tumbled 8.5% in September. That was a much steeper drop than the 0.9% decline forecast by economists surveyed by Thomson Global Markets. 
Meanwhile, the Labor Department reported that the number of Americans filing new claims for state unemployment insurance rose to 504,000 for the week ended Oct. 20. That was more than the 500,000 jobless claims expected by economists. 
The Labor Department also said that the employment-cost index rose 1% in the third quarter, slightly more than expected. The indicator measures changes in compensation costs, including wages and salaries, as well as costs for employee benefits. 
Later, at 10 a.m. EDT, the National Association of Realtors is expected to say that 5.26 million existing homes were sold last month, down from the 5.5 million sold in August. 
Prior to release of the economic news, S&P futures had pointed to a weaker opening on Wall Street, after the ECB left rates alone despite growing political pressure for another rate cut to help the stumbling European economy. 
In addition to pouring over Thursday's economic reports, investors will spend much of the session sorting through a mountain of earnings reports, said Peter Cardillo, director of research at Westfalia Investments. 
Among companies that announced quarterly earnings so far, Dow Chemical said third-quarter net income plunged 84%, hurt by weak demand, substantial price declines and a slew of charges mostly related to acquisition expenses and restructuring at Dow Corning. 
Among other stocks to watch, Enron on Wednesday replaced its finance chief, Andrew Fastow, capping a tumultuous day in which the Houston powerhouse saw its stock price continue to fall sharply. 
States suing Microsoft are hiring one of the nation's top trial lawyers, signaling they may seek a harsher antitrust remedy than the White House. Meanwhile, the software giant's Windows XP formally makes its debut Thursday. 
In key overseas markets, stocks were mixed. London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-Share Index was down 1.2% in intraday trading, while Frankfurt's DAX was 0.9% lower. Earlier in the day, Japan's Nikkei 225 average closed with a gain of 0.7%, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 0.2%. 
In Wednesday's session, Wall Street continued to shrug off disappointing earnings news, and focused instead on hopes that low interest rates and the government's economic-stimulus program will produce a recovery. 
Technology issues saw much of the buying, with the Nasdaq Composite Index rising 27.10 points, or 1.6%, to 1731.54. The Dow industrials inched 5.54 points, or 0.1%, higher to close at 9345.62, despite substantial losses in two of its components, Eastman Kodak and AT&T, which issued weak outlooks. 
In major U.S. market action Wednesday: 
Major stock indexes advanced. But on the Big Board, where 1.34 billion shares traded, 1,374 stocks rose and 1,743 fell. On the Nasdaq, 1.89 billion shares changed hands. 
Bonds gained. The 10-year Treasury note rose 13/32, or $4.0625 for each $1,000 invested. The yield, which moves inversely to price, fell to 4.588%. The 30-year bond was up 23/32 to yield 5.330%. Early Thursday, the 10-year note was up 10/32 to yield 4.553% while the long bond was 17/32 higher, yielding 5.303%. 
The dollar was mixed. Late in New York, it traded at 122.87 yen, up from 122.68, while the euro rose against the dollar to 89.35 U.S. cents from 89.07. Early Thursday in New York, the dollar bought 123.17 yen and traded at 88.27 cents to the euro.

Kaplan Fox Seeks To Recover Losses For Investors Who Purchased E

Kaplan Fox Seeks To Recover Losses For Investors Who Purchased Enron
Corp. Common Stock

NEW YORK, NY -- (INTERNET WIRE) -- 10/25/01 -- Kaplan Fox
(kaplanfox.com) has filed a class action against Enron Corp. and
certain of the Company's officers and directors in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of Texas.  The suit is
brought on behalf of all persons or entities who purchased the common
stock of Enron Corporation ("Enron") (NYSE: ENE) between January 18,
2000 and October 17, 2001, inclusive (the "Class Period").

The complaint charges Enron Corp. and certain of its officers and
directors with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
The complaint alleges that during the Class Period, defendants
engaged in asset and securities sales to closely related affiliates
and interested parties, which disguised Enron's true financial
position.  Many of the details of these transactions were hidden from
the public.  Defendants used these asset sales to falsely improve
Enron's balance sheet, thereby maintaining Enron shares at an
artificially inflated price.  Certain Enron executives, who held
positions in the affiliates that presented clear conflicts of
interest, reaped millions of dollars in personal gains from these
transactions.

The complaint further alleges that during the Class Period, Defendants
made misleading statements regarding the potential value of Enron's
Broadband business, in order to artificially boost Enron's share
price.  With knowledge that Enron's Broadband business would never
post a profit and was seriously overvalued, Defendants continued to
make misleading statements about the Broadband business in order to
maintain the share price at its artificially inflated levels.
Defendants used the artificially inflated value of Enron's Broadband
business to hedge against, in order to gain millions of dollars in
financing.  Defendants failed to disclose the risk of these financing
arrangements.  Defendants hid the true nature of Enron's earnings,
its hedging, its businesses, and the correct state of Enron's
finances from its investors and the market, further artificially
inflating Enron's share price.  While the stock was artificially
inflated for the above reasons, Enron executives engaged in extensive
insider trading, gaining personal proceeds of approximately $482
million during the Class Period, before the public became aware of
the above practices.

Plaintiff seeks to recover damages on behalf of the Class and is
represented by Kaplan Fox & Kilsheimer LLP.  Our firm, with offices
in New York, San Francisco, Chicago and New Jersey has many years of
experience in prosecuting investor class actions and actions
involving financial fraud. For more information about Kaplan Fox &

requirements.

              Mark Haines, co-anchor:

              Joe Kernen, what's going on?

              Joe Kernen, co-anchor:

              We've got to shift gears into this Enron situation which
              has just been--you've been talking about it quite a bit,
              David--how could you not talk about it?  Seventy-six
              million shares yesterday, down fifty percent in the last
              two weeks.  This is a company with--what?--a hundred
              million in revenues.

              James Cramer, guest market commentator:

              Maybe.

              Kernen:  Yeah, right.  Anyone who does any trading in
              energy apparently, you know, uses Enron Online, so anything
              that destabilizes Enron to a great extent could destabilize
              the whole energy trading arena and...

              Cramer:  Go ahead, say it!  Say what you're thinking!  No
              one has said it yet.  We know the truth.  We believe that
              Enron caused a national short squeeze.  They knew every
              single number in this gas situation.  They wrecked the
              California utility system and profited from it.  That's my
              bet.  My bet that this--they had--look, they were the
              market maker.  Imagine if Instinet knew what you were going
              to be buying and took it ahead of you.  I think they
              cornered the market for electricity for about four months,
              made a huge fortune and now the company is unraveling and
              when someone--when the Justice Department gets in there
              we're going to discover this.

              Kernen:  Let's see what happened...

              Haines:  Now, wait a second...

              David Faber, co-anchor:

              Whoa, whoa, whoa!  The Justice Department, Jim?  Now, is
              that new?  Is that something--

              Cramer:  No, that would be, if I were a prosecutor,
              something...

              Faber:  OK, so they are not being investigated?

              Cramer:  Well, no, I'm actually being a little forward
              thinking.

              Kernen:  The SEC wants documents about the limited
              partnership transactions of Mr.--

              Faber:  Which is very different from what Jim is talking
              about.

              Cramer:  No, I'm saying that this is what, if I were an
              enterprising prosecutor, I would say, Did we have a
              nationwide short squeeze in electricity caused by one
              company that had access to all the screens and knew exactly
              what was happening with the electricity market which then
              wrecked the California utility system, cost the consumer
              billions of dollars, and is now being hushed up?

              Kernen:  Well, let's talk about the actual news.  Here's
              yesterday's trading--

              Haines:  Wait a minute.

              Kernen:  Well, I just want to say that the guy is gone now.
              That's the new news here.  Did you read--did you know that
              Fastow, after four--

              Faber:  Late yesterday.

              Kernen:  Yeah, after four o'clock, Fastow is gone.  What's
              interesting--

              Faber:  He's the CFO--

              Kernen:  But he's a new CFO.

              Faber:  --who benefitted personally from some of these
              off balance sheet partnerships.

              Cramer:  Mark, you know, I'm not on thin ice here, I'm not
              on thin ice.

              Haines:  I just want to make sure we understand that this
              is your theory.

              Cramer:  This is my theory.

              Haines:  OK.

              Cramer:  It is just a theory.  It is my opinion.  But I
              think we've got to find out more about that short squeeze
              that occurred.

              Haines:  OK.

              Cramer:  We need to find out whether it was orchestrated.

              Kernen:  The new CFO might help regain some credibility for
              the company because he was the old treasurer who left that
              position a year or so ago because of some disagreements
              with how Mr. Fastow was doing business apparently.  So now
              he's back as CFO and we'll whether that calms the market
              down.

              Faber:  Well, what they need to do-- Joe, they need to come
              clean.  I mean, that is what all the investors in Enron and
              those who've left the company as investors over this last
              week have wanted.  Let's see everything; be as transparent
              as you possibly can be; tell us exactly what we need to
              know.  And as much as they need to come clean with their
              investors, they need to come clean with their trading
              counterparties because that is really what people are
              concerned about.

              Kernen:  Why is the credit worthiness issue such a big
              deal?  Anyone who does trading with them, if their credit
              worthiness were to go--if their credit rating were to go
              down, how would that affect energy trading?

              Faber:  Well, you want to know that they're going to be
              there on the other side and make good on the trades.

              Kernen:  I guess you would, wouldn't you?

              Faber:  Right.  Not that they aren't, but why would you--if
              you can trade with seven other guys--seven other companies,
              maybe you cut back a little bit on your exposure there.

              Kernen:  Now, why would--

              Faber:  And that would hurt their core business.

              Kernen:  Why are people expecting some type of action from
              the credit agencies, not because of the stock price, right?
              Because of something that could unravel--

              Faber:  Because of something related to these liabilities
              they may have--

              Kernen:  That they don't know about at this point.

              Faber:  --that they may have with regard to funding some of
              these off balance sheet partnerships that they backstopped
              in terms of borrowing that went on at the project level at
              the off balance sheet partnership.  Will it be a liability?
              They don't know.  But that's one of the reasons--

              Kernen:  We're talking hundreds of millions or billions?

              Faber:  They don't know.

              Kernen:  But there were billions of dollars in limited
              partners?

              Faber:  Yes.  About three billion in financing, I think is
              what some analysts estimated.

              Kernen:  This is a pretty big number.

              Faber:  Yeah, they can get to most of that with the assets
              that they have in the partnerships themselves.

              Kernen:  I use a six month chart to show what's happened
              over the last two weeks.  You got to look at here.  But if
              we went back a year, you'd see eighty as far as the high
              for Enron.  Now we're at sixteen.

              Faber:  Everybody else took a hit yesterday.  Dynegy got
              hurt.

              Kernen:  Well, I got Dynegy next.  Don't--  Here we go.

              Faber:  I'm sorry.  I'm getting a little excited.

              Kernen:  You are.

              Faber:  Enthusiastic about your charts.

              Kernen:  There's a weekly chart of Dynegy, and you know
              what's coming next, don't you?  Now I'm worried about the
              utility average.  I've worried about the transportation
              average a lot in my career.  Mark, now the utilities have
              replaced my worries.  I'm angst-ridden.  Did you see this
              chart?  We're breaking below the--

              Cramer:  That's a positive, not a negative, Joe.

              Kernen:  What's wrong with Cramer today?  What happened?

              Cramer:  I'm all fired up!

              Faber:  He really is.  My, God, he's got the DOJ getting
              all crazy, the FBI, the CIA.  You going down to En--you
              going down to Houston yourself?

              Cramer:  I may just have to.  I may have to clean up that
              whole city.

              Kernen:  Jim, why would the--that's the--now getting down
              to the lows, I mean, the other averages have come back
              quite a bit from the post-attack lows, the utilities are
              retesting those.  That's not something to worry about?

              Cramer:  No, because I think there's a lot of money going
              into more cyclical issues.  I think the economy is showing
              signs of getting better.  The consumer is certainly much
              stronger than we thought.  The base book didn't say the
              corporate was strong, but the consumer is strong.  Much
              stronger than before.

              Kernen:  All right.  In the past people have worried about
              the utility averages being a leading indicator, though.  I
              don't--we're talking about four hundred to two-ninety at
              this point.  That's a long way.

              Cramer:  This average has got a lot of problems to it, but

 Robert,
 
We have been the target of a number of web based articles on a site hosted by E-Rex, an electricity market broker.  E-Rex is owned by Mitsui and a couple of banks.  The website is located at www.erex.co.jp <http://www.erex.co.jp> with links to energy news.net.  The articles are in Japanese and we have translated these below.  We are not the only target, but certainly one of the main company targets.  We have not spoken with ERex or any of its owners.  It is generally believed that there are a number of different writers (Mr. Z), but maintain their anonymity.
 
It seems to us as though there are clearly some inside sources that are being used.  Could be EPower (or Enron Japan)?
 
Any thoughts?
 
Joe

E Power Practically Dissolved: What was the Cause of Its Downfall?


Mr.Z - A man behind the scenes

 E Power, a power generation company, which is jointly funded by Enron, a U.S. energy giant, and Orix, was dissolved for all intents and purposes on the 17th of this month.  On this day, 40 people, including Mr. Carey Sloan (chairman) and Mr. Tatsuro Seguchi (president) left E Power, and Mr. J O'Day (sic), who used to be the vice president of Enron Japan, assumed the office of president and CEO of E Power.  At the same time, E Power's office was moved from a building in Shinjyuku, Tokyo to within Enron Japan's office located in the First Square Building in Otemachi, Tokyo.  Rumors are starting to spread amongst people in the industry that the two companies will merge together in the near future.

 According to a source in a trading company, the recent mass departure from E Power took place, because Enron Corp, which was irritated by E Power's poor business results, fired everyone who were related to the company's generation department.  Moreover, all of the company's power plant siting projects, except for a project in Ube, Yamaguchi Prefecture, will apparently be brought back to square one.  It is looking likely that the company's large-scale gas-fired power plant project in Rokkashomura, Aomori Prefecture, which drew the attention of the energy industry, will be killed off even before a piece of land was obtained for the project.

 The greatest cause of the company's downfall was that it was unable to show any clear business strategy.  At the time of foundation, the company was intending to conduct mainly trading and intermediation of electricity.  However, the company changed its objective to siting its own power plants because it realized that securing of surplus electricity was difficult.  Furthermore, because acquisition of land had not been going well for the company, the company, until recently, had been considering energy-saving service (ESCO) as a stopgap measure until a power plant could be constructed.

 So far, the company has not been able to conduct any business that produced a cash flow.  In other words, the company has been operating with a loss ever since its establishment.  It is hardly possible for Enron, which is avaricious when it comes to pursuing cost-effectiveness, to leave this situation as it is.  One could say that E Power has done well to have held out this long.

 Another cause -a hidden cause - of E Power's downfall was surely the fact that the company held up high a flag that showed the five-letter word "Enron".  A few years ago, a person related to a certain IPP turned down an offer from E Power to purchase its surplus energy saying that "although he wouldn't mind selling power to E Power, he had not intention of selling any power to Enron".

It may have been a mistake for E Power, which was established mainly around electricity business specialists from trading companies, such as Marubeni, to have joined hands with Enron, which is particularly good at using business methods that would not be accepted in Japan.

                                                                                                                                            News Behind the Scenes  

                                                                                                                                      Another Article (Title not available)

Before I was able to overcome the astonishment that I felt regarding the terrorist attacks in the United States, a major massacre took place on the following Monday on the 17th at EPower, an affiliated company of a major energy trading company in the United States, Enron Corp.  I had thought that a major restructuring would take place soon or later, but the extent of which made me realize just how dry an American company could be.

 It has been almost two years since EPower was established, and for some employees, including executives, the term of contract was about to end.  In that sense, it is not surprising that things happened.  In any case, all EPower employees - numbering close to 50 - were called into the office by e-mail on the 17th, and 35 people were told there and then that they were fired.  Quite amazing.

 EPower's office was moved immediately to where Enron Japan's office is located in the First Square Building in Otemachi, Chiyoda-ku, from Shinjyuku Center Building in Nishi-Shinjyuku, Shinjyuky-ku, Tokyo.   The efficient way in which everything was executed was like a well-planned coup d'etat.  You could say that an Enron cruise missile has made a direct hit on EPower.

 As I described above, EPower was established two years ago under the auspices of Enron Corp as the standard-bearer of electricity liberalization.  At one stage, the company sent shockwaves through the electricity industry being compared to the black ships that came to Japan at the end of Tokugawa shogunate regime.  However, despite the company's promising start, the company seems to be heading towards an anticlimax.  It is of most people's opinion that the company's capital subscriber, Enron Corp, will abandon the company in the end, dissolving the company as soon as the remaining businesses are cleared up.  

 Among the 35 people fired from EPower, I hear that there is someone who joined the company in April this year.  There certainly was a problem with EPower's management increasing the number of staff without making much of a business progress.  However, I question highly the way in which Enron carried out dismissal en masse.  

Enron probably would argue its case by saying that people have no right to complain because the company had observed applicable laws and contracts.  However, laws and contracts are only minimal obligations.  It seems that the company has no recognition of the fact that a higher-level consideration is necessary for people with different cultures to work together.

Not unlike the US Government which does not recognize that one of the major reasons for the recent terrorist attacks on the United States was due to the shortcomings in its Middle East - Islam policy, Enron too does not understand the key elements in doing business in Japan.  

 

News Behind the Scenes: September 12

A Black Ship Named "Enron" Runs Aground in Japanese Waters

Mr.Z - A man behind the scenes

 Enron may pull out of the Japanese market in the near future - this is the opinion that is beginning to spread amongst people related to the energy industry in Japan.  The reason for this is that both "EPower", an electricity retailing company jointly funded by Enron and Orix Corp., and "Enron Japan", a fully-owned energy trading company of Enron, are being forced to fight a desperate battle in the Japanese market.  

 In particular, the way EPower is running about in confusion stands out quite conspicuously.  The company, when founded in 1999, looked to conduct electricity intermediation business, but has been having a hard time trying to launch the business because of significant barriers in the liberalized electricity market.  In spite of the fact that the company has changed its strategy to building its own power plants in various places, such as Omuta in Fukuoka, Ube in Yamaguchi, Rokkashomura in Aomori, etc., the company is still having a difficult time trying to obtain the necessary sites.

 Within such an environment, the company's CEO, Mr. Bruce Wrobel, left EPower in February this year because his plans for the company differed from that of Enron Corp's.  Then in August, Mr. Hiroo Awano, who has been quite active in visible scenes, such as dealing with the media as a deputy representative and the spokesman for the company, was suddenly fired.  It seems that he was made responsible for the company's poor performances.

 There is also information floating around that "EPower has been examining the possibility of conducting energy-saving service business in cooperation with large electrical appliance manufacturers, automobile manufacturers, general construction companies, etc., until its electricity retailing business gets going."  It is unclear whether this is a present progressive development or not.  However, it is possible to catch a glimpse of the company's impatience as it strives to "achieve whatever result possible".

 Meanwhile, there is a rumor that Enron Japan will carry out a major corporate restructuring.  Amalgamation with EPower could also be a possibility.

 The U.S. Government and USTR are making multitude of demands to the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry through U.S.-Japan Deregulation Conference so that they could somehow make Enron's advances into the Japanese market a success.  However, it seems that Enron's solidarity with politics is producing a result opposite to what was intended.  Could a black ship named "Enron," which has run aground in the Japanese waters, go to the bottom after all before too long?

Details on the cargo we are loading out of Newcastle.  Sailing time is roughly 45 days.  Cargo to be sold to ARA/German customers, most with payment terms 5 days post delivery.  Also - it would help to get an idea of how diificult this exercise will be in the coming months, as we have a couple more loading before year end.

Work it,

Stu

Stu,

I refer to your e-mail to Jez last week and advise you the expected payment value and timing etc.

Vessel name:	MV "Cotsworld"
ETA:		21/Nov 
ETS:		22/Nov
Loading tonnage: approx. 128kmt (9kmt from Stratford and 119kmt from Bengalla)
Payment value and timing :	
		Value		Timing	
 Bengalla:	US$3.3mil(*)	19th (**)
 Stratford:	US$0.2mil(*)	26th  		

* Inclusive of 10% GST
** Bengall has already delivered 49kmt of coal to port and will complete the delivery on 15th. 
The contract is based on FIS and the invoice weight and quality be determined by the inbound analysis while they take des/dem risk.
Because of their concern over our credit Bengalla has insisted on our payment by TT against the presentation of documents. Docs are likely to be 
presented on 16th or 19th at the latest. 

The draft contract which Bengalla has confirmed has a provision that the invoice weight is determined based on B/L quantity instead of inbound rail weight 
if we take 100% of Bengalla coal onto our vessel. If we do that, they can not present their docs until the vessel has compeleted the loading and our payment date would be say 26th instead.

Regards,


Tark

Mike - Our three most critical IT needs are as follows:

	Thunderball - physical functionality is in the process of being tested; should be fully implemented by end of Oct.  This will
                 significantly automate the process (saving headcount) and tighten controls
	Global Valuation - will replace the current archaic risk system; will greatly enhance reporting capabilities and decrease the
                 amount of manual work around Risk Mgmt.
	Freight Systems - critical to allowing us to manage operational costs at an acceptable level (i.e. contribute to a profitable
                 margin amount); needs to be implemented ASAP - any delays will add costs to the bottom line

Let me know if you need more details or have any questions.

Brent

Hi Jeff-

How are you?  I haven't quite melted yet, but I am coming close. It has been very hot here, but I know I can't expect to get any sympathy from someone who lives in Texas.

Thank you for thinking of me in regards to Sen. Schumer's fundraising.  What is his fundraiser's name?  I may know her or of her at least.  The political fundraising world is pretty small.

I am not sure what to make of the sunglasses comment because via email I can't tell if you were joking or serious.  But in either case, the answer is no.

Anyway, thanks again for thinking of me.  Hope all is well with you.

 -Jennie

Holy cow this is expensive.  Of course I don't care about your 5% or so, but what is the retail on these babies?  I'm pretty flexible on the fabric--mid range would be fine.  Let's move ahead.  (2 loveseats though, not 1)  How long did they say?

8.25% tax = $626.18.

You need a total of 23.5 yards of fabric.  I usually get about a 30-35%
discount on fabric so if you are OK with the couch prices, I can go to the
Decorative Center and get some fabric samples for you to choose from.  I
have no clue as to how much indoor/outdoor fabric goes for but I'll get a
range so that you can see the difference between the cheaper and expensive
type.  Let me know how you would like to proceed.

I'll find out all the details this Friday so that when you get back from
Cabo we can roll.  The couch is nice. I couldn't appreciate the webpage
picture  too much.  They will look good.  We'll talk Monday.
Have fun.

Good.  I'm going to Cabo thursday and will be back early sunday.  If you
have a few samples, I'll pick one, and well go forward.  Can we order the 3
sofas, and send them the fabric when it comes so we can get in the line of
orders?  No problem on the check.

What do you think of them?  Be brutal.

   Retail for couch is $5460 (saving $1170 about  27% lower)
   Retail for loveseat $4200 (saving $900 about 27% lower.)
   I may be able to save you more on the fabric if I can find the one you
   need
   at Kravets since they give me 50% off.  The majority of the furniture
   stores
   only give between a 20-30% off.  The couches take about 6-8 weeks if
   they
   are in stock and usually are.  I'll get some fabric this Friday during
   lunch
   and maybe I can show you over coffee that afternoon.  I'll need to order
   the
   fabric so add another 2 weeks at least before the store gets it.  Also,
   I'll
   find out paying conditions but usually is 50% upfront (cash) and then
   the
   other 50% when ready for delivery.  They don't take credit card.  Checks
   payable to me and I pay with my company check.
   I'll get moving and call you on Friday.
   Sound good?

Jonathan Miller
Kentucky State Treasurer

August 2001

Dear Friends:

    With the official launch of Kentucky's Affordable Prepaid Tuition (KAPT)
only weeks away, the program is buzzing with new developments and
initiatives.  I write to update you - and ask for your help in spreading the
word in time for our October 15 launch.

New Website:  Today, we are launching KAPT's new website:  www.getKAPT.com.
Check it out to learn more details about how the program will work and about
the options for your children and grandchildren.  Within a few weeks, the
website will contain detailed price information for our Value, Standard and
Premium plans.

October 15 Launch Event:  On the morning of Monday, October 15, we will be
launching KAPT at a news conference at the State Capitol in Frankfort.  The
conference will feature the first 100 Kentucky children to be signed up for
KAPT.  We want to invite you and your children or grandchildren to join us
for the ceremony.  Not only will they be among the first to be signed up for
this program, but also they will get a tour of the Capitol, and be able to
keep a commemorative T-shirt and graduation cap.  If you are interested in
joining us, please e-mail us at rebeccac.comley@mail.state.ky.us or call
888-919-KAPT.

KAPT Foundation:  As pre-paid tuition programs in other states have
demonstrated, KAPT's affordable monthly payment plans will open up college to
thousands of new lower to middle class Kentuckians.  Still, there are
children KAPT cannot reach - from those families who have no savings to put
aside.  That's why we are establishing the KAPT Foundation to fund pre-paid
tuition scholarships for these Kentucky youth.  The foundation will be funded
entirely by private contributions.  For more information on the foundation,
or to contribute to the program, check out www.getKAPT.com.

KAPT Logo:  As part of our extensive grassroots marketing campaign, we are
asking Kentucky businesses and organizations to prominently display the new
KAPT logo - on their internal communications, their promotional materials and
their places of business.  Please join us in our efforts.  The logo - which
directs viewers to our website and toll-free number - can be downloaded at
www.getKAPT.com.

House Parties:  Our grassroots marketing effort will also involve hundreds of
small house parties across the state, during which I or a KAPT representative
will make a presentation  about the program and answer questions of those in
attendance.  If you are interested in hosting 10-20 couples in your home
sometime at your convenience this fall, please e-mail us at
rebeccac.comley@mail.state.ky.us, or call us at 888-919-KAPT.

Payroll Deduction:  Dozens of private companies have agreed to join state
government in offering a KAPT payroll deduction to their employees.  Payroll
deduction is an excellent way - at little or no cost to the employer - to
reward your employees by making it easier to afford a college education for
their children or grandchildren.  To obtain our new KAPT Payroll Kit, which
provides signup forms and materials to distribute to employees about the
program, check out www.getKAPT.com.

Kentucky KAPTains:  I am so excited by the number of Kentucky citizens across
the state who have volunteered to be Kentucky KAPTains: individuals who will
help spread word of KAPT to their communities through visits to school and
civic groups and the distribution of brochures and posters.  We need more
KAPTains to join us, so if you or someone you know might be interested,
please signup on our e-mail list at www.getKAPT.com or call us at
888-919-KAPT.

    We will continue to update you on the program's progress before our
October 15 launch.  Until then, I hope you enjoy the rest of your summer.

Best wishes,


Jonathan Miller
State Treasurer

Chris was on the way to the airport so he asked me to send you a note 

Over the last five days the mahoney/o'brien books have lost 1 million dollars on vega against calendar 2002  19/30 brent short strangle.
vol for cal 02 is now 42.5 pct and we feel this is not a good level at which to cover this position, however the market appears liquid enough to close out if required. 

Today i have rolled 330 mb short cracks in q1 and q2 effectively reducing that exposure by two thirds, i expect to have the rest covered tomorrow 

I plan to maintain jet and kero diff shorts as this market is still under considerable pressure. prompt barrels trading at 17.50 over, deferred paper values are still in the high twenties, and airline demand shows no sign of improvement.

If you want to talk to chris i expect he will be available around 9.30 pm london time.



Tony

I'm guessing no.  Government bills aren't numbered as indicated below.  The current Senate bill 602 is the "Common Sense Federal Election Reform Act of 2001"; current House bill 602 is "Genetic Nondiscrimination in Health Insurance and Employment Act."  No email stuff in either one, I would assume.  The only email related bill is HR2281 "The Digital Divide Elimination Act of 2001."  This relates to tax credits to help lower-income people buy computers.  I can't find a record of any "Representative Tony Schnell."  I would also note that the Washington magazine is a monthly, not a weekly as suggested below.

Also, most "PLEASE FORWARD TO EVERYONE YOU KNOW!!!" emails are hoaxes.  This was a fun test- got any more?!

With SECLP being shutdown for almost two months and no positive news in sight I think we need to address the internal transfer of $28 million to settle the outstanding fuel bill. There is no longer a reason for this to remain on EFI's receivables and we need to settle the account.

Dear friends:

The departure of Jeff, like losing a member of your family, is never a pleasant experience.  He has created immense wealth for the Enron shareholder over his eleven or so years at Enron.  We will all miss him. 

However, this is in our rear view mirror and we need to move forward to reach our goals.  I want to share a number of key points that should be well communicated and understood:
	a) Ken is re-assuming the CEO role one that he has held for nearly fifteen years except for the last six months.  He understands this company.  He built Enron.  He is prepared to lead this company into the future for as long as it takes to reach our goals;
	b) The investment community knows Ken and likes his approach.  This is probably an upside given Jeff's struggles with this group;
	c) The key leaders in the organization across all of Enron, including Greg Whalley, John Lavorato, Mark Frevert, Jim Fallon, Stan Horton amongst many others, are clearly committed to Enron and its goals.  We are all firmly aligned behind Ken;
	d) There is no change to Enron's strategies and business principles going forward;
	e) The committment to the retail business is un-wavering.  Support for EES, within Enron, is at its highest in years;
	f) There is a very deep talent base in Enron and all key origination, trading and finance people are under contract; and
	g) My committment to our employees, Enron and the retail energy business continues without question.

There will be a lot of distractions for the next few days; it is very important that we move on and stay focused.  The retail and wholesale energy business must reach its short and long term goals.  I am confident we will be successful.

I am hoping to set up a number of floor meetings today to further discuss and answer any questions.  

Regards
Dave

Jeff - 

Hope all is well - it's been a while!

This is a Penn undergrad (with an MBA) who is looking for a position at Enron.  I'm not sure there's anything for him here in EES, but I'll ask around.  Would you be interested in him?

Suzanne

Dynegy Seems To Have Options In Enron Deal
By Rebecca Smith and Robin Sidel
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

11/26/2001
The Wall Street Journal
A3
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

With the stock market telling Dynegy Inc. that energy trader Enron Corp. is=
n't worth even half what Dynegy has offered to pay, analysts and investors =
are paying close attention to the circumstances under which Dynegy could ba=
rgain a lower price or even walk away from the merger deal.=20
Earlier this month, Houston-based Dynegy offered to buy its far larger cros=
s-town rival in an all-stock deal that currently values Enron shares at $10=
.85 apiece, or a total of about $9.2 billion. But in the wake of post-agree=
ment disclosures by Enron that its future earnings are likely to be substan=
tially less than expected, the company's stock has been hammered. In 1 p.m.=
 trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday, Enron shares fell 30 cen=
ts to $4.71. The stock is down 94% so far this year and far short of the pe=
r-share takeover price. Dynegy shares rose 64 cents to $40.40.
Although Dynegy and Enron both say they are going ahead with the deal under=
 the terms negotiated, Dynegy does appear to have other options. The agreem=
ent with Enron contains a broad "material adverse change" clause as well as=
 some specific trigger points that could be invoked.=20
Dynegy officials performed "due diligence" throughout the holiday weekend, =
seeking to learn more about the intimate workings of Enron, which has suffe=
red a series of damaging blows. Since mid-October, Enron has disclosed that=
 some of its officers participated in personally enriching deals that moved=
 assets off Enron's balance sheet, for a time, to several private partnersh=
ips. Those deals are now the subject of a Securities and Exchange Commissio=
n investigation. Past treatment of some of those deals has been termed an "=
accounting error" by Enron and it twice has rejiggered its earnings since O=
ct. 16. At one point, Enron restated downwards nearly five years of earning=
s.=20
An Enron spokeswoman said the company was proceeding in the belief that the=
 deal would be completed as agreed. Dynegy spokesman John Sousa said the tw=
o sides are forging ahead although he acknowledged that the walk-away provi=
sions "are broad, by design, to ensure adequate protection for Dynegy share=
holders." Shareholders of both firms must still vote on the merger agreemen=
t.=20
Clauses related to a "material adverse change," also known as a "material a=
dverse effect," have been the focus of much attention among merger professi=
onals this year, due, in part, to the stock market's fluctuations and the e=
conomic slowdown that have caused some buyers to reconsider planned acquisi=
tions.=20
But such clauses rarely are invoked by a buyer or seller because they are c=
onsidered extremely difficult to prove. Both parties typically are reluctan=
t to lay out specific terms for canceling a deal, much the way a bride and =
groom often balk at negotiating a prenuptial agreement since it appears to =
envisage a breakup of the marriage even before it begins.=20
Furthermore, a key court case earlier this year affirmed widespread views t=
hat a buyer can't easily walk away from a merger. In that case, meat-proces=
sing concern Tyson Foods Inc. sought to cancel a planned acquisition of mea=
t-packer IBP Inc. due to a drop in IBP's earnings and a write-down of an IB=
P subsidiary. But a Delaware judge refused to let Tyson cancel the pact, sa=
ying Tyson had been aware of the cyclical nature of IBP's business and the =
accounting issue.=20
In a lengthy June 18 opinion, Delaware Chancery Court Vice Chancellor Leo E=
. Strine Jr. wrote that " . . . the important thing is whether the company =
has suffered a Material Adverse Effect in its business or results of operat=
ions that is consequential to the company's earnings power over a commercia=
lly reasonable period, which one would think would be measured in years rat=
her than months."=20
That interpretation has created ripples in the deal-making community, promp=
ting some transactions to include more details about circumstances under wh=
ich deals can be terminated. Since the Sept. 11 attacks, for example, a han=
dful of merger agreements have specified that future terrorist activity wou=
ld qualify as a "material adverse change," or MAC.=20
A key issue for any firm alleging there has been a material adverse change =
is "whether the new facts go to the guts of the strategic opportunity or is=
 it just a hiccup," says Meredith Brown, co-chairman of the mergers and acq=
uisitions group at law firm Debevoise & Plimpton in New York. He adds that =
a court "may be skeptical" if Dynegy claimed that Enron's post-merger agree=
ment disclosures were a surprise.=20
The Enron-Dynegy merger agreement includes several triggers permitting eith=
er side to seek termination. Enron can quit the deal if it receives a subst=
antially better offer, although it is prohibited from soliciting one. In su=
ch a case, it could be required to pay a $350 million "topper fee" to Dyneg=
y and its co-investor, ChevronTexaco Inc.=20
Dynegy can alter the deal if Enron faces "pending or threatened" litigation=
 liabilities that are "reasonably likely" to cost Enron $2 billion. If thos=
e liabilities hit $3.5 billion "an Enron material event will be deemed to h=
ave occurred," presumably allowing Dynegy to call the whole thing off. In s=
ome situations, Dynegy would be liable for a $350 million fee, as well.=20
Karen Denne, the Enron spokeswoman, said her firm doesn't believe that loss=
es arising from the normal course of business would qualify as a material e=
vent. The liability must result from litigation. Currently, the company fac=
es more than a dozen shareholder suits alleging breach of fiduciary duty by=
 officers and directors, issuing false and misleading reports and other off=
enses.=20
Deal makers who aren't involved in the combination say the steep drop in En=
ron's stock price since the merger agreement was signed wouldn't by itself =
give Dynegy the ability to cancel the pact or force Enron to renegotiate it=
s terms. Instead, they say, Dynegy would likely have to prove that Enron's =
worsening financial condition was an unanticipated event, which could be di=
fficult in light of the company's highly publicized problems and Dynegy's f=
requent statement that it clearly understands Enron's businesses. Still, th=

NEW YORK -- The options market dozed, as many participants stayed home to r=

The Chicago Board Options Exchange's market volatility index, or VIX, which=
 measures certain Standard & Poor's 100 Index option prices to gauge invest=
or sentiment, remained in a tight range during the abbreviated trading sess=
ion the day after Thanksgiving. It fell 0.53 to 24.79.
VIX typically ranges between 20 and 30. A rise indicates traders and money =

 optimism.=20
Volatility has been dropping from post-Sept. 11 levels in recent weeks amid=
 victories over the Taliban in Afghanistan and interest-rate cuts by the Fe=
deral Reserve and other central banks. VIX ranged between 30 and 40 for sev=
eral weeks following the attacks.=20
Volatility is likely to remain low, said Mika Toikka, head of options strat=
egy at Credit Suisse First Boston. "Typically, going into the Thanksgiving =
and December holidays, we tend to experience a seasonal drift lower in impl=
ied volatility. We would expect the same this year, especially in markets o=
utside the U.S. where volatility is still lingering at high levels," Mr. To=
ikka wrote in a recent research note.=20
The CBOE's Nasdaq Volatility index, or VXN, a sentiment barometer for the t=

The Corporation: Acquisitions
The Other Instant Powerhouse in Energy Trading
By Louise Lee in San Mateo, Calif.

It's not easy being No. 4. Despite a $35 billion merger completed in Octobe=
r, ChevronTexaco Corp. is still not one of the oil superpowers. Nor, at mor=
e than $90 billion a year in revenues, is it a scrappy little guy. So Chair=
man David J. O'Reilly has been searching for a strategy beyond just drillin=
g for more oil and gas.=20
Now, he may have something: a big stake in the No. 1 energy-trading company=
. Chevron Corp. has owned 26% of Dynegy Inc. since 1996, and with Dynegy's =
planned acquisition of Enron Corp., the top energy trader, ChevronTexaco is=
 making the oil industry's most aggressive push yet into this fast-growing =
business. It plans to eventually pump $2.5 billion into the combined Dynegy=
 and Enron to maintain its 26% stake, and it might raise that share. So, wh=
ile ChevronTexaco's much bigger rivals run small in-house trading operation=
s, energy trading may soon account for more than 10% of ChevronTexaco's ear=
nings. ``Chevron is now positioned to be a leader in the business,'' says a=
nalyst Arjun Murti at Goldman, Sachs & Co.
The deal would certainly dovetail with ChevronTexaco's strategy of becoming=
 a more integrated energy company, with a hand in everything from pumping o=
il at the wellhead to trading natural-gas futures. By acquiring Texaco, Che=
vron picked up, for instance, a big refining-and-marketing business --which=
 should balance out the bad times in oil and gas production, says Eugene No=
wak, an analyst at ABN Amro. ``When crude-oil prices are down, they'll have=
 margin improvements on refining and marketing,'' he says. O'Reilly and oth=
er ChevronTexaco executives declined to comment.=20
Until now, Dynegy wasn't a big deal for Chevron. Chevron purchased the stak=
e for $700 million when Dynegy was still called NGC Corp., and it filled th=
ree of the 14 board seats--positions it will keep. Since then, Chevron has =
sold nearly all its domestic natural-gas production to Dynegy. The stake ha=
s been a good investment: it is now worth $3 billion, ChevronTexaco says.=
=20
Sitting on $2.9 billion in cash as of the end of the second quarter, Chevro=
nTexaco can well afford the Dynegy deal, analysts say. And they expect O'Re=
illy to use some of that to make more buys; the most likely target is a nat=
ural-gas company. Maybe it's not so bad being No. 4.

ALL EYES ON THE ENRON PRIZE If the deal holds, Dynegy will walk away with s=

(Copyright 2001 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)

As Houston-based Enron Corp. imploded amid a dizzying scandal over its fina=
nces, few would have blamed Dynegy Inc. CEO Charles L. Watson if he had sat=
 back and gloated. After all, Watson had watched as his bigger, brasher cro=
sstown rival sniffed at Dynegy's more cautious strategy, all the while garn=
ering most of the credit for reshaping the energy-trading business.=20
Instead, Watson picked up the phone on Oct. 24 and called Enron Chairman, C=
EO, and longtime acquaintance Kenneth L. Lay to ask how he could help. Lay =
didn't respond immediately, but as Enron's stock continued to plunge and th=
e company faced a cash squeeze, it became clear what the only realistic ans=
wer could be: Bail us out.
So two days later, Lay invited Watson to his River Oaks home near downtown =
Houston for breakfast to discuss a deal. Over muffins and ``a bad cup of co=
ffee'' the next day, Watson recalls, they sketched the outlines, and by 10 =
p.m. that night, the investment bankers were called in. On Nov. 9, Dynegy a=
nnounced that it would pay about $10 billion, plus the assumption of $13 bi=
llion in debt, to buy Enron, which is nearly four times its size. The key t=
o the deal was Dynegy's immediate $1.5 billion infusion of cash to shore up=
 Enron's balance sheet and save its credit rating. The money came from Dyne=
gy's 26% owner, ChevronTexaco Corp.=20
Without that help, Enron--the seventh-largest U.S. company, based on its $1=
00 billion in sales last year--may well have faced bankruptcy. Watson says =
that he never would have imagined such an outcome in his wildest dreams. ``=
I don't think anybody foresaw the problems [at Enron],'' he says. ``It's be=
en incredible to watch.''=20
Watson, 51, has to make good on what may well be his riskiest investment ye=
t. If he can pull it off, the new Dynegy will have revenues of more than $2=
00 billion and $90 billion in assets, including more than 22,000 megawatts =
of power-generating capacity and 25,000 miles of pipeline. It would control=
 an estimated 20% to 25% of the energy-trading market, up from about 6% now=
.=20
That would be sweet vindication for Watson's strategy. Dynegy backs trading=
 operations with hard assets such as power plants, which allows the company=
 to guarantee a supply of electricity to a buyer. In contrast, Enron has wo=
rked furiously to shed power plants and oil- and gas-generating fields, bel=
ieving it could earn higher returns using its trading and technology expert=
ise to tap assets owned by others in markets including steel, pulp, and pap=
er. IRRESISTIBLE BARGAIN. As Enron's stock slid below $9 from its August, 2=
000, high of $90, it became a bargain that Watson couldn't pass up. It woul=
d have taken years for Dynegy to build up a market-making operation to matc=
h Enron's. Its risk-management systems are top-of-the-line. Enron's commerc=
ial-services unit, which manages power supplies for corporate customers suc=
h as Wendy's International Inc., is three or four years ahead of Dynegy's, =
says Steve Bergstrom, president of Dynegy. Watson says he still plans to ge=
t rid of the $8 billion worth of assets Lay had earmarked for sale, includi=
ng the Portland (Ore.) General Electric plant and oil and gas assets in Ind=
ia. For the $1.5 billion, though, if the deal falls through Dynegy will hav=
e the right to Enron's prized Northern Natural Gas pipeline, worth an estim=
ated $2.25 billion. And Dynegy can walk away if Enron's legal liabilities e=
xceed $3.5 billion.=20
Watson firmly believes that Enron suffered from a crisis of confidence, not=
 a meltdown of its core business. Indeed, Enron's wholesale-trading operati=
on earned $2.3 billion last year. Says Watson: ``We know the business. We l=
ooked under the hood, and guess what? It's just as strong as we thought it =
was.''=20
But the trading profits were obscured in recent weeks by Enron's accounting=
 tricks. The biggest danger for Watson is that there are other time bombs t=
icking away. Already, the company has slashed its reported earnings since 1=
997 by $591 million, or 20% of its total, to account for controversial part=
nerships involving Enron officials. The Securities & Exchange Commission is=
 still investigating. ``We believe it will take more than just a couple of =
weeks and a long-term relationship [between Watson and Lay] to do all the n=
ecessary due diligence,'' says analyst Carol Coale of Prudential Securities=
 Inc. Dynegy's Bergstrom counters: ``We're pretty certain that most everyth=
ing of material consideration has been disclosed.'' If not? The massive ear=
nings boost provides ``a high margin of error,'' he says. A WANNABE. Of cou=
rse, regulators may object to the concentration of trading operations. And =
Watson will have to mesh two very different cultures. Enron is known for it=
s intense, even cutthroat entrepreneurial spirit. Dynegy's operations are m=
ore conservative; some compare it to a fraternity. Dynegy's decision to iss=
ue new stock options to some Enron employees may soothe battered egos. It s=
hould help, too, that Lay decided not to take the $60 million golden parach=
ute he could have received in a buyout. As it is, Lay will not have a manag=
ement job with the new company.=20
Dynegy often seemed to be an Enron wannabe, following it into online tradin=
g and commercial services. Still, Dynegy's 361% stock gains last year eclip=
sed Enron's 87% rise, and it rankled some that Lay's execs got more credit.=
 ``Chuck Watson may not have been in the spotlight, but he has always been =
at the forefront of this business,'' says Bruce M. Withers, who sold his Tr=

-he's a 15% owner of the new Houston Texans pro football team. But with his=

CONFUSED ABOUT EARNINGS? You're not alone. Here's what companies should do-=
-and what investors need to know
By Nanette Byrnes and David Henry=20
With Mike McNamee in Washington

(Copyright 2001 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)

In an age when giant earnings write-offs have become commonplace, it's hard=
 to shock Wall Street. But on Nov. 8, Enron Corp. managed to do it. After y=
ears of high-octane growth that had seen earnings surge by up to 24% a year=
, the Houston-based energy company acknowledged that results for the past t=
hree years were actually overstated by more than a half-billion dollars. It=
 was confirmation of investors' worst fears. Three weeks earlier, Enron had=
 announced a big drop in shareholders' equity, sparking fears that its hide=
ously complex financial statements were distorting its true performance. Ma=
nagement pointed to a number of factors, including a dubious decision to ex=
clude the results of three partnerships from its financial statements and a=
 billion-dollar error several years earlier that had inflated the company's=
 net worth.=20
Enron may be an extreme example of a company whose performance fell far sho=
rt of the glowing picture painted by management in its earnings releases, b=
ut it is hardly alone. This year, Corporate America is expected to charge o=
ff a record $125 billion, much of it for assets, investments, and inventory=
 that aren't worth as much as management thought (chart, page 79). Even if =
companies don't go back and restate earnings, as Enron is doing, those char=
ges cast doubt on the record-breaking earnings growth of the late '90s.
Not since the 1930s has the quality of corporate earnings been such an issu=
e--and so difficult for investors to determine. There's more at stake than =
the fortunes of those who bought shares based on misleading numbers. If eve=
n the most sophisticated financial minds can't figure out what a company ac=
tually earns, that has implications far beyond Enron. U.S. financial market=
s have a reputation for integrity that took decades to build. It has made t=
he U.S. the gold standard for financial reporting and the preeminent place =
to invest. It has also ensured ready access to capital for U.S. corporation=
s. That a company such as Enron, a member of the Standard & Poor's 500-stoc=
k index and one of the largest companies on the New York Stock Exchange, co=
uld fall so far so fast shows how badly that gold standard has been tarnish=
ed. ``The profession of auditing and accounting is, in fact, in crisis,'' s=
ays Paul A. Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve and now one of =
the leaders of the International Accounting Standards Board.=20
Sometimes, as in the case of Enron, fuzzy numbers result from questionable =
decisions in figuring net earnings. More often, though, the earnings chaos =
results from a disturbing trend among companies to calculate profits in the=
ir own idiosyncratic ways--and an increasing willingness among investors an=
d analysts to accept those nonstandard tallies, which appear under a variet=
y of names, from ``pro forma'' to ``core.'' (Enron offers its own such vers=
ion. Before investors untangled the importance of Enron's first announcemen=
t, its stock rose briefly because it told investors that its ``recurring ne=
t income'' had met expectations.) The resulting murk makes it difficult to =
answer the most basic question in investing: What did my company earn?=20
Why calculate a second set of earnings in the first place? Because the numb=
ers reached by applying generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) are=
 woefully inadequate when it comes to giving investors a good sense of a co=
mpany's prospects. Many institutional investors, most Wall Street analysts,=
 and even many accountants say GAAP is irrelevant. ``I don't know anyone wh=
o uses GAAP net income anymore for anything,'' says Lehman Brothers Inc. ac=
counting expert Robert Willens. The problem is that GAAP includes a lot of =
noncash charges and one-time expenses. While investors need to be aware of =
those charges, they also need a number that pertains solely to the performa=
nce of ongoing operations.=20
That's what operating earnings are supposed to do. But because they're calc=
ulated in an ad hoc manner, with each company free to use its own rules, co=
mparisons between companies have become meaningless. ``No investor--certain=
ly not any ordinary investor--can read these in a way that's useful,'' says=
 Harvey L. Pitt, chairman of the Securities & Exchange Commission. The SEC =
is examining whether new rules are needed to clarify financial reports and =
perhaps restrict use of pro formas.=20
What's badly needed is a set of rules for calculating operating earnings an=
d a requirement to make clear how they relate to net income. In the end, in=
vestors need two numbers--a standardized operating number and an audited ne=
t-income number--and a clear explanation of how to get from one to the othe=
r. ``OUT OF HAND.'' A widespread consensus is building to do just that. In =
early November, S&P proposed a set of rules for companies to follow when ta=
llying operating earnings. Only the week before, the Financial Accounting S=
tandards Board, the rulemakers for GAAP, had announced that they, too, woul=
d be taking up this issue. Volcker says the International Accounting Standa=
rds Board is also seeking a uniform definition of operating earnings.=20
``Over the past two or three years, the use of creative earnings measures h=
as grown and grown and grown to the point where it has really gotten out of=
 hand,'' says David M. Blitzer, S&P's chief investment strategist. ``Earnin=
gs are one of the key measures that anybody looks at when they're trying to=
 evaluate a company. If people want to use an operating-earnings measure, w=
e better all know what we're looking at.''=20
Without those standards in place, the gap between earnings according to gen=
erally accepted accounting principles and earnings according to Wall Street=
 is only going to grow wider and more confusing. Look at the variance in ea=
rnings per share calculated for the S&P 500 for the third quarter: It's $10=
.78 according to Wall Street analysts as tallied by Thomson Financial/First=
 Call, $9.17 according to S&P, and $6.37 according to numbers reported to t=
he SEC under GAAP. (S&P, like BusinessWeek, is owned by The McGraw-Hill Com=
panies.)=20
The lack of a standard measure can be costly to those who choose wrong. Use=
 First Call's earnings for the past four quarters and you get a relatively =
modest price-earnings ratio of 23 for the S&P 500. But run the numbers usin=
g GAAP earnings, and suddenly the market has a far steeper p-e of 38.=20
How did we get into this mess? Investors and analysts have been calculating=
 operating earnings for years, and for years, reasonable people could more =
or less agree on how to do it. Then came the dot-com bubble, along with inc=
reased pressure from Wall Street for companies to meet their quarterly earn=
ings forecasts. Suddenly, companies that hadn't turned a profit by any conv=
entional measure started offering ever more inventive earnings variants. Th=
ese customized pro forma calculations excluded a grab bag of expenses and a=
llowed upstart companies to show a profit. ``TOWER OF BABEL.'' Pro forma fo=
rmulas vary wildly from company to company and even from quarter to quarter=
 within the same company, casting doubt on their validity. And these days, =
the gulf between net earnings and pro forma earnings is wider than ever. S&=
P's tallies fall between the two: S&P's numbers are more systematic than pr=
o forma, but they aren't followed widely enough to be a standard. ``Investo=
rs are facing a Tower of Babel,'' says Robert K. Elliott, former chief of t=
he American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and a retired=
 KPMG partner. ``It's not standardized, and the numbers are not audited.''=
=20
That makes it tough to evaluate a company's performance. In the quarter end=
ed on Sept. 30, Nortel Networks Corp. offered shareholders at least three e=
arnings numbers to choose from. By conservative GAAP accounting, the teleco=
mmunications giant lost $1.08 a share. The company also provided two possib=
le pro forma options: a 68 cents loss that excluded ``special charges,'' in=
cluding some acquisition costs and restructuring charges, and a still bette=
r 27 cents loss that further excluded $1.9 billion of ``incremental charges=
,'' such as writing down inventories and increasing provisions for receivab=
les. Wall Street chose the rosiest one.=20
Confusing? You bet. Companies defend their pro forma calculations by pointi=
ng out that they're merely filling a void: Investors are clamoring for a me=
asure that gives them better insight into their company's future. The goal =
is to get to the core of the business and try to measure the outlook for th=
ose operations. ``There are good reasons why there is an emphasis on operat=
ing earnings,'' says Volcker. ``It is an effort to provide some continuity =
and some reflection of the underlying progress of the company.'' Besides, a=
s companies like to point out, they still have to report GAAP earnings, and=
 investors are free to ignore everything else.=20
There's no starker lesson in the shortcomings of GAAP than the $50 billion =
asset write-downs by JDS Uniphase Corp., the biggest charge of the year. Ne=
ar the height of the telecom bull market in July, 2000, the San Jose (Calif=
.) maker of fiber optics topped off a buying spree by acquiring competitor =
SDL Inc. for $41 billion in stock. When the deal closed in February, its as=
sets ballooned from $25 billion to $65 billion. But by then, shares of JDS =
and other fiber-optics makers were collapsing. To bring its acquisitions in=
to line with their new value, the company took charges of $50 billion. Desp=
ite the fact that the bulk of its losses stemmed from stock transactions an=
d involved no cash paid, GAAP required that the charges be taken out of net=
 income. So according to GAAP, JDS lost $56 billion in the fiscal year endi=
ng in June--a staggering figure for a company whose revenues over the past =
five years added up to only $5 billion.=20
Analysts and the company argue that besides not involving cash, the charge-=
off was all about the past, a right-sizing of values that had gotten out of=
 hand. To analyze the company's prospects, they excluded the $50 billion ch=
arge. ``The accounting is not designed to make things look better but to de=
scribe what happened,'' says JDS Uniphase Chief Financial Officer Anthony R=
. Muller, ``and we'll live with the consequences, whatever they are.'' Anal=
ysts make a similar defense. ``My goal is to figure out what the business i=
s going to produce so that we can value the company,'' says Lehman Brothers=
 analyst Arnab Chanda. GLACIAL PACE. Are JDS's pro forma numbers realistic-=
-a fair gauge of JDS's ongoing operations? Right now, it's hard for investo=
rs to judge. And that's the kind of ambiguity S&P and others would like to =
eliminate. In November, S&P circulated a memo on how to standardize operati=
ng earnings. Under the proposal, operating earnings would include the costs=
 of purchases, research and development, restructuring costs (including sev=
erance), write-downs from ongoing operations, and the cost to the company o=
f stock options. It would exclude merger-and-acquisition expenses, impairme=
nt of goodwill, litigation settlements, and the gain or loss on the sale of=
 an asset.=20
When S&P applied roughly that formula to JDS Uniphase, it split the differe=
nce between Wall Street and GAAP. Because of differences in what each group=
 included in their earnings calculations, the results were chaotic. Using G=
AAP, the company lost $9.39 a share. S&P figures it lost $3.19, while the c=
ompany put the loss at 36 cents. Meanwhile, Wall Street says it made 2 cent=
s.=20
The S&P standard may make sense, but it raises the question: Where is the F=
inancial Accounting Standards Board, the group in charge of GAAP? Chairman =
Edmund L. Jenkins says FASB will be addressing the problems. Still, investo=
rs shouldn't expect any improvement soon. The pace of change at FASB tends =
to be glacial. It typically takes four years to complete a new standard. In=
 1996, for example, the board realized that standards on restructuring char=
ges had some big loopholes and it resolved to put the issue on its agenda. =
In June, 2000, the board finally issued a draft of a new standard, asked fo=
r comments, and held a public hearing. In October, 2001, the board said it =
still wasn't ready to put a fix in place. Now, the recession has set off an=
other wave of restructuring charges, and the FASB still doesn't have new ru=
les.=20
The slow pace means the standard-setters sometimes fail to react to sudden =
changes in the market. The most recent failure followed the terrorist attac=
ks on September 11. An FASB task force, unable to come up with a set of rul=
es for separating September 11 costs from general expenses, instead told co=
mpanies that the disaster could not be treated as an extraordinary item. So=
 GAAP earnings include costs stemming from the disaster as part of a compan=
y's general performance. Many companies have nevertheless broken those cost=
s out in their unaudited press releases.=20
Many more are likely to do so in the fourth quarter. Indeed, 2001 is shapin=
g up to be one for the record books. A poor economy and the devastating aft=
ereffects of September 11 have resulted in a slew of unusual charges that a=
re unlikely to recur and that no one could have foreseen. But there's a gro=
wing concern that the earnings fog is providing managers with cover to hide=
 missteps of the past within that vast category of supposedly one-time char=
ges. The temptation will be to take as big a charge as possible now, while =
investors are braced for bad news. Not only can managers sweep away yesterd=
ay's errors, but tomorrow's earnings will look even better.=20
The basic question comes down to what constitutes a special expense--a char=
ge so unusual that to include it in the earnings calculation would be to di=
stort the truth about a company's performance. Usually, big charges fall in=
to a few categories, including charges for laying off workers and restructu=
ring a company, charges for assets that have lost value since they were pur=
chased, charges for investments that have lost value, and charges for inven=
tory that has become obsolete. In a recent study, Harvard Business School p=
rofessor Mark T. Bradshaw found that companies are increasingly calling the=
se charges unusual. That gives them a rationale for excluding them from the=
ir pro forma calculations.=20
Lots of critics disagree, saying such charges are often an inevitable part =
of the business cycle and should be reflected in a company's earnings histo=
ry. They certainly should not be ignored by investors. ``Charges are real s=
hareholder wealth that's been lost,'' argues David W. Tice, manager of the =
Prudent Bear Fund, a mutual fund with a pessimistic bent that's up 17% so f=
ar this year. ``It's money they spent on something no longer worth what it =
was, a correction of past earnings, or a reserve for costs moving forward. =
Whatever the reason, it's a real cost to the company, and that hurts shareh=
olders.'' Without standards, excessive write-offs from operating earnings c=
an obscure actual performance. Without any rules, companies calculate opera=
ting earnings inconsistently in order to put their companies in the best po=
ssible light. Dell Computer Corp. is a good example of this ``heads I win, =
tails you lose'' school of accounting. For years, Dell benefited from gains=
 in its venture-capital investments and was happy to include those gains in=
 its reported earnings, where they appeared as a separate line on the incom=
e statement. But this year, when those gains turned to losses, the computer=
 maker issued pro forma numbers that excluded that $260 million drag. Dell =
spokesman Michael Maher says the company's press releases and SEC filings b=
reak out investment income and give GAAP numbers as well as pro forma. ``In=
 our view, the numbers are reported clearly,'' says Maher. ``It's all out t=
here for the consuming public.'' PAST PUFFERY. Many experts believe special=
 charges are a sign that past performance was exaggerated. What should inve=
stors make of a company such as Gateway Inc.? Two restructuring charges in =
the first and third quarters, minus a small extraordinary gain, totaled $1.=
12 billion, or about $100 million more than the company made in 1998, 1999,=
 and 2000 combined. Which is the truer picture of its performance and poten=
tial? The write-offs or the earnings? Write-offs for customer financing are=
 another example. When Nortel increased its reserves for credit extended to=
 customers by $767 million in September, it effectively admitted it had boo=
ked sales in the past to companies that couldn't pay--in effect overstating=
 its performance in those earlier periods. In addition, Nortel says booking=
 sales and accounting for credit are unrelated issues. Tech companies blame=
 the sharp downturn in their industry for the big write-offs. And these are=
n't isolated examples. Peter L. Bernstein, publisher of newsletter Economic=
s & Portfolio Strategy, found that from 1989 to 1993, 20% of earnings vanis=
hed into write-offs.=20
Big charge-offs can also distort future performance. Critics contend that e=
xcess reserves are often used as a sort of ``cookie jar'' from which earnin=
gs can be taken in future quarters to meet Wall Street's expectations. Or c=
harges taken this year, for example, which is apt to be a lousy one for mos=
t companies anyway, might include costs that would otherwise have been take=
n in future periods. Prepaying those costs gives a big boost to later earni=
ngs. Rules for figuring operating earnings would help, but this is an area =
that will always involve a certain amount of judgment--and therefore invite=
 a certain amount of abuse. ``People are going to write off everything they=
 can in the next two quarters because they're having a bad year anyway,'' s=
ays Robert G. Atkins, a Mercer Management consultant.=20
Part of the lure of big special charges is that investors tend to shrug the=
m off, believing that with the bad news out in the open, the company is poi=
sed for a brighter future. Since Gateway detailed its third-quarter charge =
of $571 million on Oct. 18, Wall Street has bid the stock up 48%, compared =
with a 6% runup for the S&P 500.=20
Often, though, investors should take exactly the opposite message. If, for =
example, part of a restructuring involves slashing employee training, infor=
mation-technology spending, or research and development, the cuts could dep=
ress future performance, says Baruch Lev, a professor of accounting at the =
Stern School of Business at New York University. ``Are these really one-tim=
e events?'' he asks. ``Or is this the beginning of an avalanche?'' Indeed, =
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. strategist Steve Galbraith has found that =
in the year following a big charge-off to earnings companies have underperf=
ormed the stock market by 20 percentage points. ``LA LA LAND.'' Investors a=
re apt to be faced with more huge write-offs next year, even if the economy=
 doesn't continue to worsen. Why? The transition to a new GAAP rule that ch=
anges the way companies account for goodwill--a balance-sheet asset that re=
flects the amount paid for an acquisition over the net value of the tangibl=
e assets. Under the new rule, companies will have to assess their propertie=
s periodically and decrease their worth on the balance sheet if their value=
 falls. An informal survey by Financial Executives International of its mem=
ber controllers and financial officers found that at least a third expect t=
o take more charges.=20
But figuring out the proper value of those assets is no easy task. Unless t=
here is a comparable company or factory with an established market price, v=
aluing them involves a lot of guesswork for which there are no firm rules. =
``What this is really coming down to is corporations and their auditors com=
ing up with their own tests for impairment,'' says the Stern School's Profe=
ssor Paul R. Brown. ``It's La La Land.''=20
While the tidal wave of special charges is providing cover for earnings gam=
es, it could also be an impetus for change--especially in the wake of the d=
ot-com fiasco. Indeed, there are some signs of a backlash. The real estate =
investment trust industry was a pioneer of engineered earnings, with its ``=
funds from operations,'' or FFO. But now some REITs have begun to revert to=
 plain old GAAP earnings. Hamid R. Moghadam, CEO of San Francisco-based AMB=
 Property Corp., shifted back to GAAP in 1999. ``The reason I don't like FF=
O is very simple,'' says Moghadam. ``One company's numbers look better than=
 another one's even if they had identical fundamental results.''=20
There are other steps FASB could take to improve financial reporting and re=
store GAAP's status. Trevor S. Harris, an accounting expert at Morgan Stanl=
ey, says it could force companies to make clear distinctions between income=
 from operations and income from financial transactions. Lehman's Willens s=
ays companies should provide more information on cash expenses and how they=
 bear on earnings. An easy step would be to require companies to file their=
 press releases with the SEC.=20
At the least, says Lev, companies must clearly explain how their pro forma =
numbers relate to the GAAP numbers. Otherwise, he says, investors ``see num=
bers floating there, and where did they come from?'' In today's environment=
 of unregulated pro forma calculations and supersize write-offs, no questio=
n is more important to investors.

High-Gloss Glossary
Companies are using a variety of accounting practices to put the best spin =
on
their results. Here's what those terms mean:
DEFINING EARNINGS:
NET INCOME
The bottom line, according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAA=
P).
Sometimes called ``reported earnings,'' these are the numbers the Securitie=
s &
Exchange Commission accepts in its filings.
OPERATING EARNINGS
An adjustment of net income that excludes certain costs deemed to be unrela=
ted
to the ongoing business. Although it sounds deceptively like a GAAP figure
called ``operating income'' (revenue minus the costs of doing business), it=
 is
not an audited figure.
CORE EARNINGS
Another term for operating earnings. Neither core nor operating earnings ar=
e
calculated according to set rules. They can include or exclude anything the
preparer wishes.
PRO FORMA EARNINGS
The 1990s term for operating earnings. Popularized by dot-coms, it sometime=
s
excludes such basic costs as marketing and interest.
EBITDA
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. The
granddaddy of pro forma, it was initially highlighted by industries that
carried high debt loads, such as cable TV, but has since come to be widely
quoted.
ADJUSTED EARNINGS
A new term for pro forma.
DEFINING COSTS:
SPECIAL CHARGES
A general term for anything a company wants to highlight as unusual and
therefore to be excluded from future earnings projections.
ASSET IMPAIRMENTS
Charges taken to bring something a company paid a high price for down to it=
s
current market value. Many companies are now taking these charges on intern=
al
venture-capital funds that bought Internet and other high-tech stocks at
inflated prices.
GOODWILL IMPAIRMENTS
The same idea as asset impairments except they're used to write down the
premium a company paid over the fair market value of the net tangible asset=
s
acquired. These charges will explode in the first quarter of 2002 because o=
f a
change in mergers-and-acquisitions accounting that eliminates goodwill
amortization and requires holdings to be carried at no more than fair value=
s.
RESTRUCTURING RESERVES
An accrued expense (not usually cash) to cover future costs of closing down=
 a
portion of a business, a plant, or of firings. These are projected costs an=
d
if overstated can later become a boost to earnings as they are reversed.
WRITE-DOWN
Lowering the value of an asset, such as a plant or stock investment. It is
often excused as a bookkeeping exercise, but there may have been a real cos=
t
long ago that now proves ill spent, or there may have been associated cash
costs, such as investment-banking fees.

What did the company earn? That's the most basic question an investor can e=
ver ask. The equity culture that has generated so much growth over the year=
s depends on a clear answer, but getting one has become impossible. Enron C=
orp. just announced that its earnings for the past three years were oversta=
ted by half a billion dollars. How did one of the biggest companies on the =
New York Stock Exchange manage to inflate its earnings by 20% without audit=
ors, analysts, ratings agencies, and the business press (BusinessWeek inclu=
ded) discovering it? In part, blame the breakdown of standardized accountin=
g rules and the anarchy that runs rampant in the financial statements of Co=
rporate America. The U.S. needs a new set of accounting rules that gives a =
clear picture of financial performance. Without integrity in financial repo=
rting, the U.S. cannot hope to remain the preeminent place to invest in the=
 global marketplace (page 76).=20
The dot-com bubble was the first indication that there was something seriou=
sly wrong with accounting standards. Companies without much of a business m=
odel customized their quarterly statements to exclude a grab bag of expense=
s in order to put a positive financial spin on their operations. Wall Stree=
t conspired in this and encouraged big companies to join in. Soon, the meth=
od of calculating earnings began to vary from company to company and even f=
rom quarter to quarter within a company. It is now chaos.
A stricter adherence to accounting rules won't solve the entire problem. GA=
AP, the generally accepted accounting principles, allow all kinds of one-ti=
me expenses and noncash charges. This obscures the performance of ongoing o=
perations. No one can fathom what are true operating earnings because there=
 are no guidelines as to what constitutes an extraordinary expense. The res=
ult is total confusion. Take earnings per share for the Standard & Poor's 5=
00-stock index for the second quarter. Under Thomson Financial/First Call s=
tandards, it is $11.82. But it's $9.02 according to S&P and $4.83 under GAA=
P. How can investors make intelligent decisions?=20
The Financial Accounting Standards Board clearly is failing to do its job. =
It has promised to write a set of rules that calculates operating earnings =
and relates them to net earnings, but it hasn't delivered. The rating agenc=
y Standard & Poor's (owned by The McGraw-Hill Companies, as is BusinessWeek=
) is doing a better job. It recently drew up a definition of ``operating ea=
rnings'' that includes restructuring costs (including severance), writedown=
s from ongoing operations, and the cost of stock options. It excludes merge=
r and acquisition expenses, litigation settlements, impairment of goodwill,=
 and gains or losses on asset sales. This is a beginning that FASB should b=
uild on. The accounting anarchy has to end.

Schwab Chief's Main Theme: Diversification
By Lynnette Khalfani
Dow Jones Newswires

11/26/2001
The Wall Street Journal
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -- More than two months after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, many=
 investors remain edgy. But the stock market, after an initial selloff, has=
 shown remarkable resilience.=20
Few observers expect stock-market volatility to subside soon. Still, expert=
s say that now, more than ever, is the time for skittish investors to keep =
their wits about them.
In a recent interview, Charles R. Schwab, chairman and co-chief executive o=
f Charles Schwab & Co., the San Francisco-based online and discount brokera=
ge firm, gave his views on what investors should be doing -- and what mista=
kes they should avoid.=20
Here are some excerpts from the interview:=20
In the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, how much more risk, if any, do you thi=
nk is in the financial markets? Or do you think it's just that people's per=
ceptions about risk have changed?=20
I've been investing since 1959, and I have to say that, year after year, th=
e risk hasn't changed. The risk is always there. There's risk in investing =
in stocks, bonds and even U.S. Treasuries because of interest-rate [fluctua=
tions]. There's risk in real estate, too.=20
So the question is: How do you handle it? The best way is to diversify. Ove=
r a long period of time, people who diversify their investments do pretty d=
arned well. When they don't . . . sometimes it's fatal. If the only stock a=
n investor owned was Enron . . . or Cisco at 70, that was pretty fatal.=20
What do you say to people who say they're too scared to invest right now? T=
hat because of the threat of terrorism, the anthrax scares, the war in Afgh=
anistan, the recession, and so forth, there's just too much uncertainty in =
the markets?=20
I remember back during the Cuban missile crisis, we all feared the worst. W=
e were all building bomb shelters. It was a scary time. This terrorist thin=
g is no different. It's awful -- particularly for our children. But this co=
untry is so wealthy, in terms of its resources, intellectual capital and th=
e strength of our government.=20
There is no more uncertainty today than in times past. For example, we've h=
ad many recessions. It's not fun, especially when you begin reading about a=
ll these layoffs. In fact, I think the unemployment rate [now at 5.4%] pret=
ty easily might get to 6.5% before it gets better. And it probably won't ge=
t better until March or April. Also, the stock market will go up, hopefully=
 before the economy goes up.=20
There's $2 trillion sitting in money-market accounts. That's a huge resourc=
e and buying power that's definitely available for new investments.=20
What do you think is the biggest mistake investors have made over the past =
two or so months?=20
They let their emotions take over. With the fear that people had, they didn=
't use their rational thinking. They used their emotional thinking. [After =
Sept. 11], they sold at the low, and fear was the driver.=20
Just a year and a half ago, the driving emotion was greed. You're not going=
 to avoid this stuff. So the issue is how you manage through these cycles o=
f fear and greed. Even when I'm fearful of something, I say to myself: "Thi=
s is still the time to invest."=20
My biggest worry right now is that people will give up and say, "I just don=
't want to be in the stock market at all." And it's just the time that peop=
le should be hanging on and keeping a diversified portfolio.=20
Some other mistakes: A lot of people hang on to the stock that was the post=
er child of the last cycle. Or people say, "I'll get back in [the market] w=
hen I see the economy turn around." Well, by the time they see that, it's t=
oo late. They will have missed the whole ride back up.

HOUSTON -- Enron Corp. said talks are continuing with potential investors f=
or an infusion of as much as $1 billion as the biggest energy trader tries =
to avoid a collapse of its planned purchase by Dynegy Inc.=20
An investment would ease concern that Enron's weakened finances may prompt =
Dynegy to pull out of or renegotiate the terms of the transaction, which is=
 valued at $23 billion in stock and assumed debt.
Enron is seeking an additional $500 million to $1 billion in cash but would=
n't divulge details. "We are not going to discuss the particulars of who we=
 are talking to," Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said Sunday.=20
Shares of the Houston company fell by 48% in the last three trading session=
s on the New York Stock Exchange. At Friday's closing price of $4.71, the s=
tock sells for less than half the $10.85 that Dynegy is slated to pay in th=
e acquisition. That's a sign investors are skeptical the transaction will g=
o through as planned.=20
Enron is likely to have approached Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts & Co., Blacksto=
ne Group and Carlyle Group for a private equity investment, said industry a=
nalyst David Snow of PrivateEquityCentral.Net.=20
The firms have declined to comment.=20
In a conference call Nov. 14, Enron Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon=
 said the company is in talks with several private investors and expects to=
 receive $500 million to $1 billion from those sources.=20
On Wednesday, Enron got a three-week reprieve from lenders on a $690-millio=
n note due this week, gaining more time to restructure its finances. Dynegy=
 Chief Executive Chuck Watson said he was "encouraged" by the commitment to=
 extend the note payment as well as the closing of a $450-million credit fa=
cility. He said Dynegy remained committed to the purchase.=20
Enron already received $1.5 billion in cash Nov. 13 from ChevronTexaco Inc.=
 as part of the Dynegy buyout agreement. In return, Dynegy received preferr=
ed stock and other rights in an Enron unit that owns the Northern Natural G=
as Co. pipeline. Under the deal's terms, if Dynegy and Enron fail to merge,=
 Dynegy can acquire the pipeline company.=20
But Barron's reported over the weekend that Dynegy's right to the pipeline =
might be challenged by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Salomon Smith Barney Inc=
., which accepted the asset as collateral for $1billion in loans to Enron.=
=20
Dynegy spokesman John Sousa declined to comment on Enron's attempts to secu=
re financing or whether more cash for Enron is a condition of keeping the m=
erger alive.=20
Enron's dealings with affiliated partnerships have led to a federal investi=
gation of the company, which restated its earnings and saw its credit ratin=
gs cut.=20
The company said in a Securities and Exchange filing a week ago that it has=
 less than $2 billion in cash and credit lines left.

Dynegy Optimistic That Enron Merger Will Succeed - FT

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Dynegy Inc. (DYN) remains optimistic, after further re=

 the company, the Financial Times reported Monday.=20
Dynegy said that it, "remained optimistic for the potential of the merger t=
o be completed, and in the time frame we originally announced - six to nine=
 months," the FT reported.
Critical investment in Enron by J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup will procee=
d only if an unofficial pact between Enron, Dynegy, and Enron's lenders and=
 credit rating agencies remains intact, the report said. Investment from th=
ese two is likely to total between $500 million and $1 billion, while Enron=
 continues to look for a further $500 million from private equity firms.=20
The deal suffered a setback last week, when a regulatory filing revealed a =
greater debt burden than some investors had realized. Enron's share price f=
ell following the report, to $4.74 from $9.00.=20
A $1 billion secured credit line from J.P. Morgan Chase and an extension of=
 a $690 million repayment due Tuesday weren't enough to keep the share pric=
e from falling. This led to speculation that Dynegy was considering renegot=

 value of $3.5 billion, said the report.=20
Renegotiating the deal wouldn't have any impact on Enron's finances, unname=

But if Dynegy pulled out of the deal altogether, there might be no cash inf=

Dynegy Purchase Prompts Antitrust Concerns, L.A. Times Says
2001-11-26 07:36 (New York)


     Washington, Nov. 26 (Bloomberg) -- California Attorney
General Bill Lockyer is examining Dynegy Inc.'s proposed
acquisition of rival energy seller Enron Corp. for possible
antitrust violations, the Los Angeles Times reported.

     The California Independent System Operator, which manages the
state's electric grid, has asked federal regulators to ban Dynegy
and other major power sellers, including Mirant, and AES Corp.'s
Williams Cos., from selling electricity at market prices in the
state, the Times said.

     Throughout the state's power crisis, Governor Gray Davis and
other officials accused Dynegy, Enron and other power companies of
withholding electricity and manipulating the cost of wholesale
power to gouge consumers, the Times said.

     Enron is negotiating with bankers to restructure $9.15
billion in debt.

     ``I would hope that the people who look at the antitrust
implications would consider this one carefully,'' California State
Senator Steve Peace, a Democrat, told the Times. ``If anything,
Dynegy would be in an even stronger position to be able to
manipulate markets than it was before.''

India's Aditya Birla Not Eyeing Enron's Stake In Dabhol

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- India's Aditya Birla Group on Monday denied local m=
edia reports that said it is considering acquiring U.S. energy company Enro=
n Corp.'s (ENE) stake in Dabhol Power Co.=20
"I have checked with our directors and can tell you that the Aditya Birla G=
roup has shown no expression of interest in Dabhol," said group spokeswoman=
 Pragnya Ram.
The Economic Times and Financial Express reported the group is exploring th=

 institutions to buy Enron's stake in Dabhol.=20
Dabhol is a 2,184-megawatt power plant located in Maharashtra state.=20
Enron holds a controlling 65% stake in Dabhol. Costing $2.9 billion, the po=

Aditya Birla Group is a leading Indian conglomerate whose interests include=
 textiles and cement. Its two joint ventures with Britain's Powergen PLC (P=

The Enron scandal

Enron has always been recognised by other companies as best practice in ris=
k management. It put in systems to manage risks on a real-time basis and ha=
d very strong management." James Lam, founder of eRisk, a consulting firm.=
=20
As an occasional teacher and more regularly a student of the subject of man=
agement of price risks, I have been an admirer of Enron's elaborate disclos=
ure of its risk management practices. And yet, in a cascade of events over =
a period of just three weeks from mid-October, it lost two-thirds of its sh=
are value, became the subject of a US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) =
investigation, and was taken over by a rival a third in size. (Latest repor=
ts create some doubt about whether this will go through.) What went wrong?
No, the events had nothing to do with Dabhol. Indeed, if, for us in India, =
Enron will always be associated with the controversial power project, elsew=
here it is likely become a case study for students of accounting, finance a=
nd general management. (On second thoughts, even its Indian adventures woul=
d make an excellent case study!)=20
But first, a recount of what happened. After announcing on October 16, with=
out much explanation or transparency, that it has taken a charge of $ 1.2 b=
illion against equity, Enron's share price started tumbling. Apparently, th=
e charge was the result of some financial transactions, and the SEC launche=
d an investigation. The chief financial officer (CFO), who was directly inv=
olved with the transactions, the company's treasurer and a couple of other =
senior officials were sacked.=20
Perhaps most damagingly, Enron revised its accounts from 1997 onwards, redu=
cing profits by about $ 600 million and increasing debt by a somewhat simil=
ar amount. As a result, Enron's credit rating was downgraded.=20
It seems the root problem was not in its basic business of power and gas tr=
ading, but in its investment activities controlled by the CFO. These compri=
sed private equity, and Enron's share in each of the investee companies was=
 kept artificially below 50 per cent to avoid consolidation of accounts. To=
 this end, outside investors were brought in and assured of equity in Enron=
 itself, should the value of the investee company(ies) fall below agreed th=
reshold(s).=20
All this was done to keep the losses in investments off-balance sheet, and =
mitigate their impact on reported profits. Many other US corporations inclu=
ding J P Morgan Chase, which had large private equity investments, have suf=
fered on this score (see World Money October 15). Enron wanted to avoid thi=
s and, last year, paid its since-dismissed CFO $ 30 million for his creativ=
e accounting genius.=20
Incidentally, those enamoured of US GAAP and its alleged superiority over t=
he rest of the world should note that all these gimmicks were blessed by th=
e company's auditors one of the Big Five firms, which was paid $ 25 million=
 as audit fees and $ 27 million for other services by Enron last year.=20
The restatement of the accounts from 1997 onwards became necessary as the E=
nron management/board and the auditors were forced, on review, to admit tha=
t at least some of the transactions should have been on, rather than off, b=
alance sheet. Details of all the transactions in question are yet to come o=
ut, but what has come out is bad enough.=20
But this apart, a billion dollar hit for a company of the size ($ 300 billi=
on) or cash flow ($ 3 billion) of Enron is, by itself, hardly a death warra=
nt. But it turned out to be just that for Enron.=20
Perhaps because it was too arrogant? Perhaps also because its accounts lack=
ed transparency and their opaqueness ensured that investors' confidence was=
 always somewhat fragile?=20
But there are two other points worth noting: the professionalism of equity =
analysts and whether the event restores somewhat the balance between tradin=
g and producing. As for the first, the professional analysts were surely aw=
are of the opaqueness of the accounts,but few questioned the management agg=
ressively on the subject. Perhaps the stock was too glamorous and typified =
the spirit of the times trading assets was what the "masters of the univers=
e" did, not the boring old business of producing oil or power or cars. The =
Enron management itself was proud of the way it operated in its principal a=
ctivity of trading in power and gas, with Skilling, the former CEO, claming=
 that "we are on the side of angels. We are taking on the entrenched monopo=
lies. We are bringing the benefits of choice and free markets to the world.=
" (The quotation is from an interview in BusinessWeek, prior to Skilling's =
inglorious exit from Enron a couple of weeks before the bubble burst).=20
For the analysts, there was also safety in numbers. Skilling claimed that "=
Enron's operations are built around the integration of modern financial tec=
hnologies and physical technologies", bringing derivatives theory to tradin=
g in power and gas! Obviously, the fate of Long Term Capital Management has=
 not led to more sober management of trading risks.=20
Surely the role of "markets" should be to reduce the distance, and cost, be=
tween producer and consumer? One does feel that there is something perverse=
 in a society that values, in terms of compensation, the trader (don't forg=
et this is just a euphemism for the speculator) over the producer whether i=
n the bond, currency or power and gas markets. The markets and, indeed, gre=
ed obviously have a role to play, but surely the pendulum needs to swing a =
little bit to the left?

India's Mehta Comments on Birla Group Offer to Buy Enron Stake
2001-11-26 03:42 (New York)

     Mumbai, Nov. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Jaywantiben Mehta, India's
union minister of state for power, comments on reports of Aditya
Birla Group, which owns Grasim Industry Ltd., the nation's third-
biggest cement maker, bidding for Enron's stake in Dabhol Power
Co.

     Enron wants to sell its 65 percent stake in Dabhol Power,
India's biggest foreign investment, at cost. The project is mired
in a tariff dispute over $64 million in bills that haven't been
paid by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, its only
customer, for eight months.

     ``One more bidder will increase competition, which is
welcome.

     ``Any step in the national interest is good.

     ``Cheap energy is always in the national interest since we
want to increase electricity generation and sell it at a
reasonable price.

     ``I can't comment on the time-frame of buying out the Enron
stake until the legal wrangles are solved. Once that's cleared,
then we will try and clear the proposal quickly.''

--Gautam Chakravorthy in the Mumbai newsroom (91-22) 233-9027

I am very tired too, but I had a lot of fun. Please let me know when you have mood to do it again, and we should keep the place "secret". Last night's dinner was cancelled, so I didn't get the chance to send out the invitation to your party today. Have you made the decision to fly or drive to see your parents? When you get back, let's plan a Enron Wharton party.
 
All the best!
 
Li

Attached is our report on the impact of last week's events on the reinsurance industry.  We are continuing to monitor revised claims estimates and other implications for the industry and will update you on any developments as soon as possible.

Highlights include:
Initial Estimates
?	A trend toward initial estimates growing over time as more information becomes available typically occurs, especially in times of complex and costly disasters.
The complexity of the insured coverage (multiple types, heavily syndicated, heavily layered and heavily reinsured) makes developing estimates on even the most straightforward exposures (e.g., commercial property) a huge challenge.  Other sources of exposure (e.g., business interruption and 3rd party liability) are nearly impossible to estimate accurately at this time.  
Insurers generally track their losses on a net basis, based in the presumption that all ceded reinsurance is collectible.  There will likely be disagreements between insurers and reinsurers about the extent of coverage.  It is also possible that some reinsurers will be unable to honor all their claims, leaving primary insurers to shoulder a heavier load.
Industry Implications 
Beyond the immediate impact of this disaster on insurers' direct costs, industry analysts also note a broader number of implications for the industry:
Continued flight to size and quality of insurance carrier, causing further consolidation of the industry.
Acceleration of price increases already underway within commercial insurance and reinsurance.  
Acceleration of restructuring at Lloyd's, a market that specializes in just the types of coverages (aviation, specialty commercial, catastrophe reinsurance) that will be hardest hit.  Some analysts put Lloyd's share at $1.5 billion or more, a heavy blow given that many Lloyd's syndicates have suffered significant losses in recent years.

George,
My comments are that we have been reaffirmed by everyone except Moody's.  Moody's put us on watch only which is not unusual with a 1 billion write off.  Moody's is working with us to re-affirm.

There is no issue on liquidity or credit issues.  I am listening to the analyst call right now which these issues are being discussed.  We will defend our rating - period.

I hope that helps.

Larry any other comments from a finance guy?

Mike

I don't have all the facts to agree or disagree.  Until John Z has approval to trade currency, I wouldn't think you would want to go down this path.  In addition, I'm sure  you know hegding currency this big and late of Fridays is tough.

Given the volatility in the gas market (which is the sole impact on the Canadian power book's US dollar exposure) and the exhorbitant cost involved in hedging multi-year cashflows (i.e. as evidenced by Friday 10/19/2001 trade of -$1,200,000 Cdn new deal value for the 14 year swap that I entered into), I will manage the currency exposure of this book myself, I will hedge appropriately when I see fit and will not accept hedges forced on Enron Canada because of arbitrary position limits set by your department.

Not yet. 

We're making progress on agreeing the contractual language (three issues left which I think we'll get through - awaiting their response). The main problem is that they are  insisting that we sign the deal with their unregulated arm -  LG&E Fuel Services Inc. as opposed to KU.  Their explanation is that b/c LG&E Fuel Services Inc. is unregulated,  they wouldn't be the subject of a Public Service Commission Review in the event Enron doesn't perform. 

Tom Moran is in contact with KU to see what umbrella if any LG&E Fuel Services Inc. is lying under.

Will keep you updated. 

Lenny

Subject:	KU Compliance Deal '02 - '04 

We're trying to close an in the money sale with KU.  They called Tom Mcquade yesterday evening to say that they can't deal with us b/c of credit. Their commercial guy suggested that if we want to get this deal done quickly, we should go through their unregulated group - LG&E Fuel Services Incorporated and we need to keep the original contractual language as they initially proposed.

We need to get this deal closed quickly, consequently:

1. We either need to get KU's credit guys comfortable with our credit or do this deal with LG&E Fuel Services Incorporated.
2. Tom, do you feel comfortable with LG&E's Fuel Services Inc. credit? The sale is 300,000tpy for 3 years '02-'04 at $39/t in a roughly $37/t market and dropping. 
3. Wayne, please call their attorney Beth Cocaneougher. She's the one who told their commercial guy they can't deal with us b/c of credit. Apparently she wants to have us revert back to the original contractual language (sounds like a re-trade) and do this deal with LG&E. Please call her to see what language she needs changed beyond what we have already agreed to and see if we can get our credit guys to discuss any concerns that they might have with whoever is a decision maker over there. 

Thanks,
Lenny

Jeff:

It was great catching up with you yesterday.  I wish we had the time to do
it more often.

Here is Albert and Frances Paley's information:

Albert Paley Studio
25 N. Washington
Rochester, New York 14614

716-232-5260 (studio)
716-461-5087 (home)

I do not have an email for them.

It also ocurred to me that you should try to come to our next Design Council
meeting (March 12th at 6:30 p.m.)  The meeting is a tour of Gail and Louis
Adler's collection.  Not only do they have amazing contemporary art but they
have a number of pieces by Paley including a fireplace surround that they
commissioned.  It might give you some ideas for your own project.

Their address is:

3680 Inwood Drive
Houston, Texas 77019

I hope to see you there.  Please let me know if I can do anything else.

Cindi

Keeping in Touch

Since the events of September 11, members of the Wharton community have united to help one another through this difficult time.  Alumni, students, faculty, and staff have come together to share information, offer consolation, and reach out to help those affected by these horrific attacks.

Ten Wharton alumni lost their lives during the September 11 attacks.  The thoughts and prayers of the entire Wharton community go out to the family and friends of these alumni:

Mukul Agarwala, WG'90
J. Howard Boulton, WEV'94
Mark Charette, W'85
Robert Deraney, WG'83
Garth Feeney, W'95
Nicholas Humber, WG'67
Hideya Kawauchi, WG'93
Michael Miller, W'84
Tu-Ahn Pham, WG'89
Michael San Phillip, W'67

During the first days after the attacks, over 2000 Wharton graduates connected with one another through the "Friends and Family Status Database." The information that Wharton alumni offered on has been saved in a "Friends and Family" archives (http://wave.wharton.upenn.edu/friends_and_family/).   A "Community Discussion Board" was also created, through which alumni communicated about fellow graduates and loved ones as well as shared feelings about the events of September 11.   There is an online summary of the Wharton community's response (http://www.wharton.upenn.edu), including a video of Dean Harker's remarks at a memorial service on the Lehman Quad.

The Wharton Club of New York has taken the lead to assist alumni whose businesses have been affected.   A telephone hotline has been established to connect small- and medium-sized businesses with those who can provide assistance.  To reach the Wharton Club of New York's hotline, call 1.800.327.8065 or send e-mail to help@beckofficefurniture.com.

Attached is the headcount detail for Energy Operations as we discussed in Monday's expense meeting.  London costs do not tie to Monday's schedule because I made some reductions after the meeting.  Call me if you want to discuss.

Hi Donnis, 

I know it has been hard selling the land, but we need to come up with a payment schedule, or your will need to give me the land valued at $11,500.  What do you prefer.  In light of the difficult times at the company these days, I'd like to get this resolved.

Thanks for understanding.

Dear Equity,

	Good morning!

*	The Bush Administration is working with members of the Senate Banking
Committee
	to reach an agreement on terrorism insurance legislation. The design of
the plan
	resembles the Bush Administration's proposal of a temporary program under
which the 
	federal government will pay a certain percentage of claims from a
terrorist attacks
	during the next few years.

*	We are now in the 5th week of the end of recession rally. Each week that
goes by 
	where stocks and bonds move up together, the more convinced we get of a V
shaped
	recovery.

*	There is a great package of news suggesting that inflation plunges over
the next
	few months:
		-- Consumer inflation expectations down sharply
		-- German import prices declining
		-- Tokyo CPI continues to decline
		-- Philly Fed Prices Paid plunging

*	After bouncing for 3 weeks, our overall company surveys index of 14
industries 
	declined last week.

*	Although capex has already been weak, it is likely to continue to weaken
in Q4 as
	suggested by surging layoff announcements. Managements making the tough
decision
	to lay off workers are likely to also cut capex.

*	JIM MOLTZ HAS SWITCHED HIS RECOMMENDATION IN TECH FROM AN UNDER-WEIGHT TO 
	MARKET-WEIGHT.

Rick,

As you know we have stopped our agricultural commodity businesses, and therefore do not need any VAR associated with these businesses.  If this VAR is allocated to EGM, I would like to reallocate it within the business unit.  If VAR is approved for specific businesses, EGM will give this VAR back to Corp.

As well, I would like to reclass all softs, grains, and meats on the DPR as "other" and remove those headings.

Thanks

Jeff

Our sources in Riyadh continue to believe that the Saudis will push for a quota reduction of around 1.5 mb/d. The story out of Vienna early this week may be "more than 1.5 mb/d including non-OPEC" just to get a higher headline number. Also, the current view is that OPEC might make its cut effective Dec. 1, rather than Jan. 1 as OPEC President Khelil has suggested in recent weeks. 

On one hand, the market knows that OPEC cannot fully implement a new quota as early as Dec. 1, but on the other hand, it would signal a more aggressive approach. This could buy the cartel some six weeks -- by the time Dec. compliance disappoints in early Jan., winter demand should provide some fundamental tightening.  And Nov compliance (with the current quota) should look good in early Dec.

Bottom line: talk of 1.5+ cut, plus possible early implementation date could take WTI higher early this week, although expect many players to sell rally. No demand-side surprises expected from Monday IEA report.

Finally -- the prevailing view right now is no smart sanctions and an easy Iraq rollover -- one more reason for OPEC to get aggressive. In the unlikely event that Bush and Putin agree on smart sanctions this week, the chances of an Iraqi disruption would increase and this would complicate OPEC's plans to move aggressively this week.

Just got off the phone with the Federacao Unica dos Petroleiros....here's their take on what is going to happen going foreword

First of all..the news was wrong again...there is another meeting today and talks / negotiations are currently under way to alleviate the strike.  

They asked for a 30% increase in wages and more disclosure on safety, but Petrobras replied that they would only raise the wage by 6%....according to the union, the inflation rate was 8.30% over the last year and they are outraged by the counter-offer of only 6%....I asked what Petrobras could do to make the workers return...she said that they only needed to offer about  a 10-12% increase.  She said that after the counter offer came back the union would disseminate the information to the workers who would then vote on whether they should return to work.  

As far as refinery operations she claims that there has been little change in operations and that the last shift of workers that went in on Tuesday have been taken captive / hostage and that they have been forced to keep output flowing.  She believed that the output would fall off because the workers lacked "conviction" and wanted to leave...she thought they may break something in the refinery or revolt in order to gain freedom.  The FUP is seeking legal action against Petrobras to get the workers out, but she said that she didn't really think they could get them out...so it doesn't look like the workers will leave anytime soon and the only way the refineries are going to ramp down is if the workers sabotage the system.  

When I asked her if she thought the strike would continue she said that she thought that Petrobras would make a counteroffer today and that if it was greater than 10% the workers would likely agree to work.  She said that there was much anger among the workers and that another bad counter offer would be "very destructive"  

My general impression was that the strike will go on only if Petrobras doesn't play nicely.  One interesting discrepancy was that oil production, according to the union, was down 80% as opposed to the earlier 60%, but we have no way of substantiating that due to the fact it's Petrobras word against their word.

Good.  I'm going to Cabo thursday and will be back early sunday.  If you have a few samples, I'll pick one, and well go forward.  Can we order the 3 sofas, and send them the fabric when it comes so we can get in the line of orders?  No problem on the check.

What do you think of them?  Be brutal.

I may be able to save you more on the fabric if I can find the one you need
at Kravets since they give me 50% off.  The majority of the furniture stores
only give between a 20-30% off.  The couches take about 6-8 weeks if they

fabric so add another 2 weeks at least before the store gets it.  Also, I'll
find out paying conditions but usually is 50% upfront (cash) and then the
other 50% when ready for delivery.  They don't take credit card.  Checks
payable to me and I pay with my company check.
I'll get moving and call you on Friday.
Sound good?

Holy cow this is expensive.  Of course I don't care about your 5% or so,
but what is the retail on these babies?  I'm pretty flexible on the
fabric--mid range would be fine.  Let's move ahead.  (2 loveseats though,
not 1)  How long did they say?

   OK...
   Sofa = $4290
   Loveseat = $3300
   8.25% tax = $626.18.
   Total = $8,216.18.  Both w/out fabric.

   You need a total of 23.5 yards of fabric.  I usually get about a 30-35%
   discount on fabric so if you are OK with the couch prices, I can go to
   the
   Decorative Center and get some fabric samples for you to choose from.  I
   have no clue as to how much indoor/outdoor fabric goes for but I'll get
   a
   range so that you can see the difference between the cheaper and
   expensive
   type.  Let me know how you would like to proceed.
   Thanks, Tina

   Hi Tina,

   Thanks for you help.

   The site is www.thewickerworks.com.  Click on it to go directly there.
   The are in Houston at Walter Lee Culp.  713 623 4670.

   If you go to their web site go to the home page, then to the tab that
   says wicker, then to the tab that says more.  The design is Helva.

   I need 1 Helva sofa, and 2 Helva loveseats, of course in a very plain
   off white (not tan as one of the pictures shows) indoor/outdoor fabric.

   Or if you have any other ideas, let me know, of course.

   Regards,

   Jeff

IN THE MONEY: Another Sign Investors Don't Trust Enron
By Michael Rapoport

11/26/2001
Dow Jones News Service

A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- If you needed any further proof that investors no longer trust Enron Corp. (ENE), here's another piece of evidence - one that goes to the heart of the recent plunge in the company's stock.
Enron doesn't simply trade for less than its book value; it fell below that milestone weeks ago. No, now it trades for less than ONE-THIRD of its book value. 
That's a rare level for a company of Enron's size and prominence. And it may mean, among other things, that investors have decided that they simply can't place any further faith in the veracity of Enron's earnings and balance-sheet figures, much-revised as they've been - something that has unnerving implications for any attempt to value the company fairly. 
First, let's be clear about what this means. Enron stock is currently about $4 a share; the company's reported book value is about $12.90 a share. In other words, Enron stock sells for less than one-third of what shareholders would get if the company were to liquidate - were to turn all its assets into cash, pay off all its liabilities on its balance sheet and give what's left over to shareholders. 
This is an uncommonly dismal level for any company, even a troubled one. For comparison's sake, Dynegy Inc. (DYN), which has agreed to buy Enron, trades at about three times book value, as does El Paso Corp. (EPG), a competitor of both companies. In fact, Enron has the second-lowest price-to-book ratio of any company in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index - only Conseco Inc. (CNC), another troubled company, is lower, by an eyelash. 
Part of the problem is undoubtedly the continuing fear among investors that Dynegy's agreement to buy Enron will fall apart, and the belief that Enron will have to file for bankruptcy if it does, in which case Enron shareholders would be hard-pressed to realize any value. The Dynegy deal now amounts to about $10.60 per Enron share, itself well under Enron's book value; the huge premium that level offers over Enron's current stock price is an indication of the big risk investors see that the deal won't be consummated in its current form. 
But given Enron's current woes, it's certainly also possible that Enron is trading at such a big discount to book value because investors don't feel they can trust the earnings and balance-sheet numbers coming out of Enron. Those numbers, after all, are the raw material that form the basis for valuing Enron, or any other company, by computing figures like price-to-book and price-to-earnings ratios. 
And the Enron debacle has been all about the quality of those numbers, with Enron shifting assets off its balance sheet to outside limited partnerships from which some of its executives benefitted. In terms of those numbers, the ground has shifted underneath investors three separate times now - when the company slashed its reported shareholder equity by $1.2 billion to unwind its transactions with one of those partnerships, when it restated nearly five years' worth of earnings downward by a total of $586 million, and when it revealed that it could take further charges and was facing an imminent deadline to post collateral on a $690 million note. (That deadline has now been extended until Dec. 14.) 
When you've gotten punched in the face three times, it's not unreasonable to fear there'll be a fourth blow, no matter how much the puncher assures you there won't be. Given Enron's insanely complicated structure, and the way bad financial news has dribbled out of the company over the past several weeks, who can guarantee there aren't more such shocks yet to come? 
That's what investors appear to be fearing, and that may be part of the reason Enron stock has fallen so precipitously. Thanks to Enron's repeated demonstrations that its numbers can't be relied on, investors no longer have a firm, trustworthy basis on which to value the stock. And so, not surprisingly, the value is getting ratcheted down to the most conservative, bare-minimum level. 
An Enron spokesman couldn't be reached for comment. 
It's ironic, in a way. For a long time, it was hard to properly value Enron because its structure and finances were so complex and hard to decipher. Now it's hard to properly value Enron because the company's attempts to clarify its finances have made it clear that it's hard to expect investors to trust in their accuracy.

Dynegy Board Silent On Status Of Enron Takeover >ENE DYN
By Christina Cheddar
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/26/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- As the market continues to speculate about the status of Dynegy Inc.'s (DYN) takeover of Enron Corp. (ENE), Dynegy's board isn't offering its opinion. 
"Any comments coming out of Dynegy are coming from the company's executives," said Jerry Johnson, a Dynegy board member who also is an executive vice president at Safeguard Scientifics Inc. (SFE).
Johnson declined to comment on any matters related the pending acquisition of its larger rival, and wouldn't say whether the board has been meeting to discuss the transaction. 
Three other board members, through their representatives, declined to comment as well. Other non-executive directors on the 14-member board either weren't immediately available to comment or couldn't be reached. 
As for Dynegy's management, spokesman John Sousa said the company's opinion on the deal remains the same since its last comments on Wednesday. 
At that time, Dynegy Chairman and Chief Executive Chuck Watson said Dynegy was continuing its due diligence and was looking to accelerate regulatory approval of the deal. 
According to Sousa, Dynegy worked through the holiday weekend gathering information as part of its due diligence efforts. 
Meanwhile, Enron continued its discussions to raise between $500 million to $1 billion of additional financing, said Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne. The company also is working to restructure its debt by mid-December, she said. 
But investors appear to be voting with their feet. Enron shares were recently down 18.3%, or 86 cents, to $3.85, while Dynegy shares slipped 2.7%, or $1.06, to $39.34. As a result, the already huge discount to the deal's offer price has grown even bigger as the market continues to signal the deal won't get completed on its original terms. 
Under the terms of the transaction, Enron shareholders are to receive 0.2685 of a Dynegy share for each share outstanding, or about $8.98 billion, based on Dynegy's recent stock price. 
At Enron's recent level, the stock is trading at a 64% discount to the Dynegy offer. 
Neither Sousa or Denne would comment on the stock movement. 
Dynegy has already provided Enron with a $1.5 billion cash infusion that is secured by Enron's pipeline assets. While that investment has helped Enron's near-term liquidity position, it remains unclear how long the company can remain solvent without any added investments.

Enron, Banks Formalize $690M Debt Extension To Dec. 14
By Carol S. Remond and Christina Cheddar

11/26/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
Of Dow Jones Newswires 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) and a group of banks last week formalized an agreement to extend the due date on a $690 million syndicated loan by three weeks to Dec. 14.
The loan relates to one of Enron's consolidated limited partnerships that owns minority interests in power and energy projects around the world. Enron said last week that Standard & Poor's downgrade of its credit rating to "BBB-" had triggered an obligation to repay the loan by Nov. 27. 
People familiar with the matter said last week that lead banks J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. and Enron will use the extension to negotiate a further postponement of the debt to the middle of 2002 when other Enron bank loans come due. About $1.75 billion of Enron's $3.5 billion in syndicated bank loans come due in May 2002 and will likely need to be restructured. 
About $250 million of the assets securing the $690 million loan are in the process of being sold and will be used to pay down the loan, reducing the outstanding portion of the loan that will need to be restructured, those people familiar with the matter said. 
Enron's shares and bonds continue to suffer from mounting uncertainties about the company's finances and whether those could force one-time rival Dynegy Inc. (DYN) to reconsider its offer to buy Enron, an offer that many see as Enron's only chance to avoid bankruptcy. Enron stock was recently down 18% to $3.84. Meanwhile, Enron bonds are also lower, with the 6.4% bonds due 2004 recently trading at a distressed level of 48 cents on the dollar.

Citigroup Has $2.38B Less To Lose On Enron Due To Swaps
By Christine Richard
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/26/2001
Dow Jones Capital Markets Report
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Citigroup Inc. (C) is expected to extend a hand to Enron Corp. (ENE) by renegotiating a $690 million payment due Nov. 27. 
But investors shouldn't be concerned that the financial services giant is too exposed to the embattled energy trading company. Citigroup already may have laid off the loan and other exposure via a series of credit default swap transactions. That means more institutional investors left holding the bag if Enron isn't ultimately rescued from financial collapse by a takeover proposed by Dynegy Inc. (DYN).
Over the last few years, Citigroup has entered into at least six transactions that effectively would allow the bank to lay off the equivalent of $2.384 billion in Enron exposure. 
Citigroup was instrumental in setting up Enron Credit Linked Notes Trust, Enron Credit Linked Notes Trust II and Yosemite Securities Trust I, which together raised $1.750 billion; Enron Sterling Credit Linked Notes Trust and Yosemite Securities Co., which raised a combined GBP325 million; and Enron Euro Credit Linked Notes Trust, which issued EUR200 million. 
Citigroup, which acts as the default swap counterparty to the trusts, receives the return on the portfolio of single-A-plus-or-better-rated securities, purchased with the proceeds of the offerings, in exchange for providing the payout on the Enron exposure, according to Mary Ryan, director of synthetic securities ratings at Standard & Poor's. 
As long as Enron remains out of bankruptcy, Citigroup continues to make payments on the notes, Ryan said. 
If Enron defaults, Citigroup would cease making payments to the trust. The single-A-plus-or-higher-rated securities in the trusts would go to Citigroup in exchange for the same nominal amount of now in-default Enron debt obligations. And with speculation mounting that Dynegy will reduce, or maybe even scrap, its offer to buy Enron, the chances of a such a default-driven transfer would appear to be rising. 
These notes essentially are synthetic Enron debts, meaning they act like Enron bonds in many respects, but lack key components that make holders true creditors of Enron. 
For instance, the holders of these notes, because they don't possess actual Enron obligations - and won't unless the company defaults - are not involved in negotiations to restructure or rollover debt. It has been reported that Enron is engaged in active negotiations over the terms of its debts with creditors. 
The synthetic notes all carry a rating equivalent to Enron's rating of triple-B-minus from Standard & Poor's and Baa3 from Moody's Investors Service. 
The rating on the securities has been downgraded in recent weeks to reflect the downgrades in Enron's ratings. 
Citigroup officials did not respond to requests for further details on the transactions. -By Christine Richard, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2189;

Enron Is Sued Over 401(k) Plan; Plaintiffs Seek $850M

11/26/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) was sued Monday in the latest of at least three purported employee class action suits the company faces over lost 401(k) retirement savings due to the recent collapse of the price of Enron stock. 
In a press release Monday, Eli Gottesdiener, a Washington, D.C. attorney who filed the latest suit on behalf of employees, said it seeks $850 million in plan losses, in part because the company sold Enron stock to its employees knowing the price was artificially inflated.
An Enron spokeswoman declined to comment. 
Unlike two similar, recently filed suits against Enron, the latest also contends that Enron offered the stock without the required prospectus. 
If proven, the sale without a prospectus "give workers the automatic right to rescind their purchases and receive their money back with interest," Gottesdiener said in a statement. 
Enron "locked down" the retirement plan from Oct. 17 to Nov. 19, to make administrative changes, which prevented employees from selling Enron shares as the share price collapsed amid growing disclosures of financial problems. 
Earlier this month, Houston-based Dynegy Inc. (DYN) offered to buy its far larger competitor in an all-stock deal that values Enron shares at $10.85 a piece, or about $9.2 billion. 
Enron later disclosed that its future earnings would be substantially less than expected and shares fell sharply. 
Enron currently trades at $4.05 a share, down from their 52-week high of $84.88 a share in December 2000. 
The first suit was filed Nov. 13 on behalf of plaintiffs by Campbell Harrison & Wright LLP in Houston. A second was filed last week by Seattle-based Hagens Berman LLP.

Dealers said that with Enron shares having slid well below the Dynegy offer price of 9.85 usd a share, the ChevronTexaco affiliate may well reconsider its offer, or walk away from the deal all together. 
"People are making the bet that perhaps Dynegy may cancel the deal, and that's there a lot more risk in playing the arbitrage," said Jefferies & Co market strategist Art Hogan. 
The deal with Dynegy contains a "material adverse change" clause, which could be invoked to call the deal off, he said. 
As part of its due diligence, Dynegy is examining details of Enron's filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week, which reportedly contained information it had not received previously. 
Enron shares have plunged further since the filing, in which Enron revealed a number of new financial problems including a possible obligation to repay a 690 mln usd note due Nov 27. 
Enron subsequently received an extension on the repayment until mid-December. 
Since the beginning of the year, Enron shares have lost over 90 pct of their value after it was revealed that the company would post hefty third-quarter charges linked to risky investments by the firm's former chief financial officer. 
"At this point, with so much smoke around the fire, I think the shares are rightly valued," said Jefferies' Hogan.

USA: UPDATE 1-Enron shares slide lower as merger doubts intensify.
By Janet McGurty

11/26/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
NEW YORK, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Shares of troubled energy giant Enron Corp. continued to lose ground on Monday amid fears that the proposed acquisition of the company by smaller rival Dynegy Inc. will fall through. 
Enron stock was down 61 cents, or 12.9 percent, at $4.13 in active midmorning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Dynegy has agreed to pay $10.55 per share for Enron.
"The market is acting like the deal is not going through or not going through at the original terms," said Michael Heim, an industry analyst at A.G. Edwards & Sons. 
Heim said that among three possible scenarios - the deal goes through as planned, it is canceled, or it is restructured - the first is the least likely. 
"Escape clauses" built into the Dynegy-Enron deal give the buyer the option to back out if there is serious deterioration in Enron's business or assets. 
"Dynegy has a good claim that the 'material adverse condition' clause has already been triggered, either by the $690 million loan being accelerated, earnings (being) down or the ongoing trading business weakness," he said. 
Last week Enron said it could be forced to pay a $690 million debt this week because of a credit downgrade, but the payment deadline has been delayed until mid-December. 
Enron's recent admission that lower volumes at its trading business - the crown jewel that Dynegy most covets - could cause low fourth-quarter earnings raises the possibility that the trading business is losing its profitability. Continued lower volumes there would remove a key attraction for Dynegy. 
"Every day that goes by where Enron trading volumes become less, it decreases the value of the assets Dynegy was trying to buy in the first place," Heim said. "Besides trading and marketing, what value does Enron have?" 
The majority of Enron's physical assets are spoken for, with partnerships and creditors getting first dibs and Dynegy getting the first right to exercise its option to acquire Enron's Northern Natural Gas pipeline. 
Dynegy, which is 26.5 percent-owned by energy giant ChevronTexaco , is to swap 0.2685 share of its own stock for each share of Enron. Shares of Dynegy were down $1.27, or 3.1 percent, at $39.13 in midmorning NYSE trade. 
Enron agreed to a Dynegy buyout after it was overwhelmed by a series of problems, including a U.S. regulatory probe of off-balance-sheet dealings by its officers, a $1.2 billion cut in shareholder equity, and cuts in its credit ratings. 
Enron subsequently restated its earnings, but investor unease snowballed and its share began tumbling. The shares were above $90 in August 2000. 
Heim said he was not sure that EnronOnline, Enron's online trading platform, is the premier property it once was. 
"Two years ago it had some value, but now others have been able to duplicate it. It's not the computer systems - it's the traders and network that Enron had. If those go away, the value lessens.

USA: Enron lawsuit seen as wake-up call for pensions.

11/26/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
HOUSTON, Nov 26 (Reuters) - A Washington, D.C., lawyer said Monday he hopes heavy losses suffered by Enron Corp. employees will spur Congress to limit employee investments in their employers' stock through 401 (k) retirement plans. 
"How many workers have to lose both their jobs and their retirement savings before Congress steps in and puts a stop to this by placing a cap on the amount of company stock that can be in a 401 (k) plan?" lawyer Eli Gottesdiener asked.
Gottesdiener released a statement Monday saying he had filed a lawsuit on behalf of employees of the beleaguered energy giant who have lost an estimated $850 million on Enron stock held in their 401 (k) retirement accounts. 
The suit is the third one filed against Enron that alleges the company breached its fiduciary duty to employees by encouraging them to invest in its stock at artificially inflated prices. All three suits seek class-action status. 
Enron's shares have fallen from a high of $90 in August 2000 to less than $5 today, their decline accelerating since Oct 16 amid a series of disclosures about its deteriorating finances. 
Like many other companies, Enron makes matching contributions to its employees' 401 (k) retirement accounts in its own stock. It also requires them to hold the stock they receive in matching contributions until they turn 50. 
Enron employees were also prevented from selling Enron stock held in retirement accounts for several weeks from mid-October due to a change in the retirement plan's administrator. 
Gottesdiener said investment advisors recommend investing no more than 15 percent of a portfolio in a single stock, but that participants in 401 (k) plans offering employer stock as a choice typically hold 33 percent of their portfolio in that stock. 
"Congress sensibly placed a 10 percent limit on company stock in traditional defined benefit plans back in 1974, but at the behest of the corporate lobby, it placed no such cap on defined contribution plans," he said. 
The absence of such a cap in defined-contribution 401 (k) plans was "completely indefensible," he said. 
Gottesdiener's suit alleges that Enron violated federal securities law by offering and selling Enron stock to employees without issuing a prospectus. If proven, this would give workers the right to reverse their purchases, he said. 
Gottesdiener is also involved in class action pensions litigation against New York Life Insurance Co. and SBC Communications Inc..

USA: US Corp Bonds-Bonds tighten, analysts fret on Enron.

11/26/2001

By Jonathan Stempel 
NEW YORK, Nov 26 (Reuters) - U.S. corporate bonds outperformed
Treasuries on Monday as traders edged back to their desks 
following the Thanksgiving Day weekend, in the midst of a broad 
revival for corporate bonds of all stripes. 
In secondary trading, spreads, the yield difference between 
the bonds and comparable maturity U.S. Treasuries, tightened about 
0.01 percentage point. 
"I would expect a continuation of the tightening, especially 
with Treasury interest rates going up," said one trader. "Absolute 
corporate yields are starting to look pretty attractive." 
Corporate bonds, especially junk bonds, have outperformed 
Treasuries this month as investors developed a new tolerance for 
risk. Though absolute returns for investment-grade corporate bonds 
are negative, they are even worse in the Treasury market, where 
investors appear more convinced that the current U.S. economic 
downturn won't be deep or long. 
"The successes in Afghanistan and some milder-than-anticipated 
economic data have combined to increase investor appetite for 
risk," wrote fixed-income research service CreditSights Inc. in a 
report dated Monday. "While the severity and swiftness of the bond 
market's correction was a surprise, it hasn't changed our basic 
view of U.S. corporate bonds and we continue to recommend 
overweight positions." 
This week's forward calendar remains quiet. 
In early trading, 10-year Treasuries rose 10/32, as their 
yields fell to 4.971 percent. 
ENRON 
Market participants are closely watching Houston-based Enron 
Corp. as the largest U.S. energy trader tries to merge 
with smaller cross-town rival Dynegy Inc. , keep its 
investment-grade credit ratings, and manage a load of $9.15 
billion of debt and other obligations, much of which is unsecured 
and coming due within 13 months. 
Of this debt amount, $690 million could come due by 
mid-December, and $3.9 billion immediately if Enron falls to junk 
status. The key to resolution of this matter, some observers 
believe, is Enron's banks. 
"The goal of the banks now is to re-cut their exposure to gain 
as much structural seniority or asset liens as possible, take out 
fees, raise rates, take down total exposure, and generally improve 
their risk-profile under multiple scenarios," said CreditSights. 
"The very bankers who are supplying liquidity through new 
secured bank lines and who are rumored to be considering equity 
investments are the ones on the hook (and unsecured) for $3 
billion in bank loans," wrote Carol Levenson, an analyst for 
GimmeCredit, another fixed-income research service. "If Dynegy 
backs out (in the interest of self-preservation), these vital bank 
renegotiations might save Enron but leave unsecured bondholders as 
the patsies." 
Enron's existing 6.4 percent notes maturing in 2006 and 6.75 
percent notes maturing in 2009 were bid on Friday at 57 cents on 
the dollar, down from around par on October 12, before Enron first 
reported third quarter results, which it later revised downward. 
Enron shares have fallen 94 percent this year to their lowest 
level since early 1989. 
DATA 
Investment-grade and junk bond spreads narrowed 0.1 and 0.27 
percentage point last week, respectively, to 1.68 and 7.84 
percentage points, according to Merrill Lynch & Co. Junk bond 
spreads have narrowed 1.45 percentage points this month. 
For the month, junk bonds have returned 2.996 percent, while 
investment-grade corporate bonds have lost 2.355 percent and 
Treasuries 3.488 percent, Merrill Lynch said. For the year, the 
respective bonds are up 4.777, 9.634 and 6.565 percent.

TALES OF THE TAPE: Energy Traders' Perfect Storm Stalls
By Christina Cheddar

11/26/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES (This story was published originally Friday) 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Here's one 2001 outlook that couldn't have been more wrong.
Around this time last year, pundits and fund managers were touting "the perfect storm" of market forces that were coming together to make the energy trading business one to watch in 2001. 
Then came the California power crisis, and allegations of price-gouging and fears of credit defaults began to cloud the outlook for the group. That was followed by renewed volatility in power prices, and this time the prices were headed down, not up. 
And then came a crushing blow against trading firms - the unraveling of the industry's largest player, Enron Corp. (ENE). 
Simply put, the perfect storm stalled, and a business once buoyed by high gas prices, strong demand and tight supply now lies in tatters. 
The stocks of companies whom some say should be valued more like growth stocks than utilities are instead mired at around nine-times earnings - about where traditional utilities trade. 
And the chance for recovery in 2002? 
Basu Mullick, portfolio manager of the Neuberger Berman Partners fund, is willing to bet there is. He thinks energy traders deserve at least the same price-to-earnings multiple as the broader market's median, which is currently between 16- to 17-times future earnings, he said. It's just a matter of time before the stocks get there. 
"They were just recovering from Gray Davis," Mullick said, referring to the governor of California, who had accused "out-of-state" energy traders of artificially inflating the price of power in the state, and triggering the state's energy crisis. "Now, they are recovering from Enron." 
The fund manager also blames lower commodity prices, warm weather and poor demand for the recent weak performance in the group. 
"Energy convergence companies are putting up terrific growth rates," he said. "I don't think they should get the same valuation as a garden-variety utility." 
Still, others think the stock market is continuing to make distinctions between the energy traders by taking a harder look at the companies' strategies and financial disclosures. 
Enron's precarious financial situation underscores the importance of accounting issues. Although many of Enron's financial problems aren't solely the fault of mark-to-market accounting issues, there has been growing attention paid to this form of financial reporting because of the earnings volatility it can create. 
Answers Elude Investors 

Investors are asking hard questions, and not always getting the answers they want. 
Using mark-to-market methods, a company calculates the fair market value of a commodity position - whether it's a contract, an option, a swap, etc. - at the time, even if the value of the position is realized over a longer period. The problem with this method is the actual cash a company realizes from the position might not be the same value the company calculated in its original assessment. Also, sometimes it isn't easy to calculate the fair value of the commodity position. This is particularly true in instances where the market for the commodity isn't liquid. 
Over time, companies with the highest level of disclosure regarding their mark-to-market gains will most likely trade at higher multiples to counterparts that provide little or no disclosure, said ABN AMRO Inc. analyst Paul Patterson. 
Encouragingly, it appears companies may already be responding to the call for added disclosure. According to a survey Patterson conducted, more companies with energy trading units were willing to disclose the details of their mark-to-market accounting practices during third-quarter conference calls compared with those in the second quarter. 
Patterson said he prefers earnings that are cash-based. 
"All things being equal, we believe reported earnings that more closely reflect the timely realization of cash have a higher quality associated with them than earnings that do not," he said. 
He expects investors to become smarter and learn to distinguish between earnings growth through accrual accounting and growth fueled by mark-to-market accounting. 
At the end of the day, it is not a matter of simply producing profits, but being able to say where those earnings came from, said one investor, who manages a pension fund. 
Some investors also may be placing a greater emphasis on the cash flow the energy merchants produce. 
Tim O'Brien, portfolio manager of the Gabelli Utilities Fund, said energy merchants that own the physical power assets to back up their trading positions should trade at a premium to an independent power producers and traditional utility companies. Still, the stocks should be valued at less than the growth rate of the company because of their heavy exposures to commodity prices. 
Energy merchants include companies such as Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) and Dominion Resources Inc. (D). 
According to O'Brien, the group never deserved to have the price-to-earnings multiples above 20- to 30-times earnings, which were once paid for the stocks. 
"We all got sucked up by the up-leg of the cycle and forgot just how cyclical these companies are," O'Brien said, adding that the average multiple should be in the high single-digits to the high-teens. 
As for independent power producers - which are companies without regulated operations that own power plants to generate electricity to sell and trade in the wholesale market - the group may wind up being valued on the basis of the replacement costs of the assets in their portfolio, according to O'Brien. 
"One analogy is that they are basically like commercial real-estate plays," O'Brien said. 
That could mean stocks such as Calpine Corp. (CPN), which is already in the lower-half of its trading range, may have further to fall.

INDIA: UPDATE 1-India's AV Birla group denies bid for Enron unit.

11/26/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
(Recasts with denial, comments from financial institution in paragraphs 5-6) 
BOMBAY, Nov 26 (Reuters) - The Aditya Vikram Birla Group, a leading Indian conglomerate, on Monday denied newspaper reports it was looking to buy U.S. energy giant Enron Corp's 65-percent stake in the beleaguered Dabhol Power Company.
"There has been no expression of interest in Dabhol. We are not interested," a top AV Birla group official told Reuters. 
Two leading Indian business dailies earlier said the group, whose interests range from textiles to cement and carbon black, is eyeing Dabhol to expand its interests in the domestic power sector. 
The Economic Times and the Financial Express said the group was exploring the possibility of submitting an expression of interest to Indian financial institutions to buy Enron's stake in the company. 
An official of state-run Industrial Development Bank of India, the leading financier of the $2.9 billion project in the western state of Maharashtra, said he has not heard from the Birla group. 
"We have not received any official communication from them," the official, who did not wish to be identified, told Reuters. 
The spokesman for Dabhol was not available for comment. 
FIGHTING FOR SURVIVAL 
Enron Corp, which is fighting for survival in the United States amidst investor doubts over its corporate governance practices, owns 65 percent of Dabhol. General Electric Co and Bechtel own 10 percent each, while the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) owns 15 percent. 
Dabhol and MSEB have been fighting over payment defaults and high tariffs for over a year. The dispute has affected India's efforts to attract foreign investment in the power sector and caused Enron and its U.S. partners to announce plans to exit the project. 
Tata Power Company Ltd, India's largest private sector utility firm, and BSES Ltd, another utility company and a member of India's largest conglomerate, the Reliance Group, are already in talks to buy Enron's stake. 
The AV Birla Group has adopted the route of mergers and acquisitions in recent years to consolidate its position in key industries. 
Last week, one of its group companies, Grasim Industries Ltd, bought a 10-percent stake in India's largest cement maker, Larsen & Toubro Ltd 
Earlier this year, Indian Rayon & Industries Ltd, another group company, entered the information technology sector by buying out France's Groupe Bull SA's 50.35 percent stake in PSI Data Systems 
But the group's track record in the power sector has been less than impressive. 
Two joint ventures with Britain's Powergen Plc to produce over 1,000 megawatts of electricity in two Indian states have not made much headway since they were announced in the mid-1990s.

Enron's Stock, Bonds Drop on Concern for Dynegy Bid (Update8)
2001-11-26 16:45 (New York)

Enron's Stock, Bonds Drop on Concern for Dynegy Bid (Update8)

     (Adds analyst comment in 4th paragraph.)

     New York, Nov. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s stock price
declined to a 14-year low and its bonds plunged 10 points on
concern the company won't secure $1 billion in fresh capital,
threatening its plan to be acquired by Dynegy Inc.

     ``The clock is definitely ticking,'' said Jon Kyle
Cartwright, a debt analyst at Raymond James and Associates. ``The
question is the survivability of Enron.''

     J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. executives met
today to line up investors for as much as $2 billion of bonds
convertible into stock. The company needs the money to operate
until Dynegy completes its $23 billion purchase. Dynegy unveiled
its plan to make the acquisition on Nov. 9.

     Enron shares and bonds, which opened lower, tumbled after 1
p.m. when no announcement for fresh financing was made. Enron's
6.4 percent notes that mature in 2006 plunged to 48 cents on the
dollar, down from 55 cents on Friday. The bonds now yield 26
percent. Enron shares declined 15 percent, or 70 cents, to $4.01.

     Concern that rival Dynegy may change or cancel its bid for
Enron has pushed Enron's stock down 55 percent in the past week.
Enron's shares had plummeted 86 percent since mid-October after
the company reported a $618 million third-quarter loss and said
expansion into water, telecommunications and retail-energy sales
cost it $1.01 billion.

     ``You haven't heard anything from Dynegy today, and that is a
bit scary,'' said Andy Palmer, who doesn't hold Enron bonds in the
$2 billion he helps manage at ASB Capital Management Inc. in
Washington.

     Part of the third-quarter charge was connected with limited
partnerships run by the chief financial officer. He was ousted,
and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission started an
investigation into Enron's accounting. The company earlier this
month restated its earnings for the past four years.

                        Talks on $1 Billion

     Under the buyout, Enron investors would receive 0.2685 Dynegy
share for each share held. That valued Enron at $10.41 a share, 21
percent more than Enron's share price that day.

     On Friday, the buyout valued Enron at $10.85 a share, more
than double Enron's closing price of $4.71. The widening of the
difference between the value of the offer and Enron's stock price
indicates investors doubt the buyout will go through.

     Shares of Enron traded as low as $3.76 today, rebounding to
close at $4.01. The stock was the most active in U.S. trading
Wednesday and Friday. Dynegy dropped $1.15, or 2.85 percent, to
$39.25. The stock has fallen 30 percent this year. Both companies
are based in Houston.

     Egan-Jones Ratings Co. lowered its rating on Enron's credit
today to ``BB-'' from ``BB.'' ``Dynegy needs to show its support,
or Enron will slide,'' the firm said in a report.

     Moody's Investors Service hasn't issued a report on Enron
since the company filed its 10-Q quarterly report with the SEC a
week ago. The ratings agency's analysts haven't returned calls for
comment.

     Moody's cut Enron's long-term credit rating on Nov. 9, though
it maintained an investment grade.

                          `More Problems'

     ``Time is not Enron's friend,'' said Stewart Morel, co-head
of investment grade debt research at UBS Warburg LLC. ``There is
increased concern in the market that there may be more problems
that are yet to be disclosed.''

     On Wednesday, Enron got a three-week reprieve from lenders on
a $690 million note due this week, giving the company more time to
restructure its finances. Dynegy Chief Executive Officer Chuck
Watson said he was ``encouraged'' by the commitment to extend the
note payment, as well as the closing of a $450 million credit
facility, and that Dynegy remained committed to the merger.

     Terms of the $690 million note were outlined for the first
time in the Enron filing a week ago. Enron also said that it has
less than $2 billion in cash and credit lines left. If the
company's cash reserves run too low, Enron's credit rating may be
cut below investment grade. That would trigger $3.9 billion in
debt repayments for two affiliated partnerships.

     Enron said in the filing that fourth-quarter profit might be
hurt by a drop in its trading business. Companies such as Aquila
Inc. and Mirant Corp. have reduced their activity with Enron
because of credit concerns.

     ``Should the Dynegy deal fall through, we don't view it
likely that Enron would be able to remain as a stand-alone
company,'' Youngberg of Edward Jones said. ``Without Dynegy, the
credit rating will fall, causing their trading business to dry up
further.''

     Enron, the biggest energy trader, once handled about a
quarter of U.S. gas and power transactions.

     Enron's bankers met with leveraged buyout firms and two
industrial companies to seek an investment, the New York Times
reported last week. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc.
agreed to terms that give each of them a $250 million equity stake
as part of a transaction to be completed today.



Dynegy Bonds Slip as Enron Purchase May Harm Credit Rating
2001-11-26 15:16 (New York)

Dynegy Bonds Slip as Enron Purchase May Harm Credit Rating

     New York, Nov. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Dynegy Inc. bonds have
fallen as much as 9 percent this month on investor concern the
energy trader's proposed $23 billion purchase of rival Enron Corp.
will erode its credit rating.

     Dynegy's 6.88 percent coupon notes due in 2011 are trading at
$932 per $1,000 face value, down from $1,024 last month, according
to Merrill Lynch & Co. data. Yield on the debt has risen to 7.9
percent from 6.5 percent as investors demand more return to
compensate for the increased risks of the securities.

     Dynegy's credit is rated ``Baa3'' at Moody's Investors
Service, the lowest rung of investment grade, and ``BBB+'' at
Standard & Poor's, two levels higher. Each ratings company said it
may cut Dynegy's credit rating if it buys Enron, which comes with
about $15 billion in debt and a regulatory inquiry into financial
partnerships set up to keep debt off its books.

     ``If you put Dynegy and Enron together it will have a
detrimental effect on Dynegy's credit rating,'' said Tim Nelson,
senior credit analyst at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray Cos. in
Minneapolis, which holds Dynegy bonds.

     Dynegy's 7.45 percent coupon notes due in 2006 are trading at
$1,019 per $1,000 face value, down from $1,085 last month,
according to Merrill. The notes yield almost 7 percent, up from
5.4 percent.

     Enron's credit is rated ``Baa3'' at Moody's and ``BBB-'' at
S&P, the lowest level of investment grade. Both ratings companies
are reviewing the credit for a possible downgrade and say Dynegy's
buyout plan is what's keeping the grades above junk.

     ``I don't think right now anybody knows exactly what Enron
is,'' said Mark Simenstad, who holds Dynegy bonds in the $5
billion he helps manage at Lutheran Brotherhood.

     ``Dynegy has proven to be pretty well-managed over the years
so you have to give them the benefit of the doubt here,''
Simenstad said. ``The hope is that if there's something they don't
understand they'll walk away.''

     Dynegy has $3.9 billion of bonds outstanding, most of which
come due between 2002 and 2011, according to Bloomberg data.

     Shares of Houston-based Dynegy, which topped $47 two weeks
ago after Chief Executive Chuck Watson said the Enron purchase
would boost earnings by at least 35 percent next year, fell $1.30
to $39.10 in mid-afternoon trading today. Enron's shares, down 92
percent this year, fell as much as 80 cents, or 17 percent, to
$3.91, a the lowest since 1987.



ENRON SHARES SLIDES TO ALL-TIME LOW

By CBS.MarketWatch.com

4:53 PM ET Nov 26, 2001

HOUSTON (CBS.MW) -- Enron shares fell as much as 20 percent Monday,
crashing through the $4 level for part to set an all-time low and cast
additional doubt on the energy merchant's plan to be acquired by rival
Dynegy.

Enron (ENE) set a new all-time low of $3.76 Monday afternoon before
closing at $4.01, off 70 cents. More than 60 million shares changed
hands, making it the most active issue on the New York Stock Exchange.

The stock has lost about half its value since Dynegy announced an
agreement to buy Enron on Nov. 9 and more than 85 percent of its value
in the past month.

Meanwhile, shares of Dynegy (DYN) lost $1.15, or 2.8 percent, to stand
at $39.25.

The collapse in Enron's share price has made it more likely that Dynegy
and Enron will have to renegotiate the terms of their original deal, in
which 0.2685 of a Dynegy share would be exchanged for each outstanding
Enron share.

However, the Financial Times reported that Dynegy remains confident of
its ability to complete a deal for Enron, which has been seeking $500
million in private equity capital to shore up its finances.

"We continue to hear reports the Enron's energy marketing and trading
business, once the crown jewel of the company, has eroded badly with
counterparties only willing to do shorter-term deals," A.G. Edwards
&amp; Sons analysts Charles Fishman and Douglas Fischer wrote in a
research note Friday.

Enron investors do not believe that the merger is likely to occur under
the current terms, the analysts said.



Chance of Dynegy backing out

_______________________________________________________________________

On Monday, Michael Heim, also of A.G. Edwards, attributed Enron's
latest stock drop to "growing belief that the likelihood of the (merger)
deal is not so likely."

He pointed out that the outlook for Enron is "not very favorable" but
in the meantime, it's doing everything it can to stay "afloat" while
working on closing the deal.


Last week, Enron said it got a bank extension on a $690 million note to
mid-December. The note was originally set to come due in 2003, but was
bumped up to Nov. 26 due to a rating downgrade at Standard &amp; Poor's.
<http://cbs.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7B81418CA4%2D11A5%2D4C7C%2DA602%2DCF3DA4BCAA7B%7D>

The payment by itself is manageable because Enron has about $2 billion
in cash on its hands, Heim said, but "the event moves Enron's merger one
step closer to the point in which Dynegy is able to exercise the
merger's material adverse condition clauses and back out of, or
restructure, the merger deal."

Heim has a "sell" rating on the stock.

Hi Mark,

As you know, our meetings with Dow have not progressed as far as I would have liked.  However, we are about to launch physical polyethylene and physical polypropylene on EOL because of the deals we've done with Formosa.  

I would like to call Carlo Gaurino (at least) from at Dow just before launch and wanted to know if you wanted to be on that call.  (Plus, it might be a litte entertainning when they hear this).  Since we met with their CEO, I figured a call from me or us was appropriate. 

Jeff

I also told Mike Mcconnell the same thing in Cabo. I talked to him by the pool on Saturday afternoon. I said it will take your full-time efforts to fix the place.

You really should take a sabbatical from COO and just come and run the whole thing. Clearly you are the only one who understands the nuts and bolts of trade till liquidation.

Dear Jeff:

I spoke to you at the Chicago Fair & have asked Mai to email you
images & information for the 2 Burtynsky images you were interested
in.

We were very successful with Ed's work at the fair and the 40x50"
Rock of Ages #7 that was at the Chicago Fair sold. All of the
Burtynsky prints we exhibited were sold as well as others. The last
print from the 40x50" edition priced at $6,100. may be released to us
in the beginning of June. Please let me know if you would be
interested in this print and I can hold it for you if it is released
to us. It is the very last 40x50" print of this very popular image.

We'll mail you an information package on Ed Burtynsky as soon as we
receive copies of the most recent press. As I may have mentioned to
you at the fair, Ed has received a lot of very favorable press
recently including a review of our show in the current issue of
ArtNews. He has an upcoming retrospective exhibition at the Canadian
National Gallery of Art and a one-person exhibition at Toronto's
prestigious venue The Power Plant.Two publishers have expressed
interest in publishing a monograph for Ed. So it's a very exciting
time for Burtrynsky; his career is really taking off.

If I can answer any questions for you, please email me or give me a
call 415-421-0122. Please let me know about Rock of Ages #7.

Ada Takahashi

i was planning a meeting in portland to discuss a couple of new deals and i would need to have 3 people (inluding me) fly out there next week.  the only fares are around $2k.  given the new expense policy, i wanted to see if you would have any problems with that.  i am typically very frugal with travel and always assess the cost-effectiveness.  the deals have about $1m value and will be more likely to close in person.  i need to know by end of today.  thanks.

i also have a 1-sheet strategy brief that i wanted to go over w/ you & mike earlier.  we should come back to that now.

Jeff,

I will be able to make the offsite, but I don't see a slot for a presentation.  I presume you would like me to give an update?

As EGM concludes its first year of business, we have shown that there is real health, success and future opportunities for our businesses.  Our importance to the success of Enron is clear.  Now we would like to review our first year.  In your presentations at the off-site meeting next week, Mike and I would like each of the presenters to outline the following: your business' biggest success and biggest failure; what was different from original market observations, and did this help or hurt business; lessons learned and what you would do differently; and your best opportunities for next year.  I know that time is short but hopefully this will not be too difficult with your recent 2002 plan work.  

Please prepare your presentation in PowerPoint with a simple format and no graphics or background. Each presenter will be given approximately 30 minutes to speak. All PowerPoint files are due to Jennifer Burns via email by no later than 1:00pm on Monday, October 15.

Dear Jeffery:
We goofed! Last week, you received a message from us inviting you to a November 19 event here at Wharton designed for HR executives. (It's a great program, with more than 80 senior HR execs attending, but clearly not intended to meet your priorities.)
In fact, the program we wanted to bring to your attention is a special 3-day symposium, developed in conjunction with a group of top Wharton faculty in response to the general economic climate and the potential repercussions of September 11.
"Wharton on the New Business Reality: Scenarios and Strategies for the Future"http://aresty-direct.wharton.upenn.edu/nbr/  
December 3-6, 2001 
This one-time program is designed for senior executives who help set and implement strategy and direction, or are charged with new business development for their organizations. Despite the short lead-time, we hope that you -- or someone appropriate from your organization -- will plan to attend. 
Many of the School's top faculty are taking part, including Jeremy Siegel (finance), Jerry Wind (marketing), Mike Useem (leadership), Ian MacMillan (entrepreneurial management), Steve Kobrin (international management), Harbir Singh (strategy), Peter Cappelli (human resources), Olivia Mitchell (insurance and risk), Franklin Allen financial services) and Dave Reibstein (marketing). 
Sessions and discussions will cover topics such as "Consumer Confidence and Behavior," "Business Portfolio Implications," "Leadership in Uncertain Times," Technology Perspectives," "The Global Supply Chain Post Sept. 11," and "Impact on Financial Markets." 
The program is designed to be intensive and interactive - to provoke lively discussion - and to provide the insights, tools and opportunity for participants to think strategically about their own organizations. Participants will leave with specific strategies identified for their organizations.
Enrollment in the symposium is limited, but we are pleased to extend to you priority registration (for yourself and/or someone else you designate). To reserve and ensure your place, we do need to hear back from you by Tuesday, November 20. (Enrollment can be completed online at http://aresty-direct.wharton.upenn.edu/nbr/  ) 
If you have any questions, please contact Ray Del Bianco, our director of business development, at 215-573-9205, or email delbianr@wharton.upenn.edu .  
We look forward to welcoming you at Wharton for what we know will be powerful event with timely content that should be immediately applicable to your business and organization.
Best regards,
Robert E. Mittelstaedt, Jr.
Vice Dean and Director
Wharton Executive Education <http://execed.wharton.upenn.edu/ >

Jonathan Miller
Kentucky State Treasurer

October 2001

Dear Friends:

It all began three years ago - just two parents, sitting at the dinner table,
grappling with how to pay for our daughters' college education.  One
political campaign, two legislative sessions and thousands of hours of
preparatory work later, the quandary my wife Lisa and I faced is about to be
resolved as KAPT, Kentucky's Affordable Prepaid Tuition, is about to become a
reality.

In just one week - on October 15 -- thousands of Kentucky families will be
able to join us in taking advantage of the opportunity to enroll their kids
in KAPT, which will guarantee the cost of tomorrow's tuition at today's lower
prices.

The details are as promising as the headline:

*   KAPT guarantees payment of full tuition and fees at any public college or
university in Kentucky;
*   Benefits also can be used at private Kentucky colleges and other colleges
and universities nationwide;
*   Parents, grandparents or other account-holders can pre-pay tuition in one
lump sum, or in manageable monthly payments over the course of several years;
and
*   Investments grow completely tax-free.

With budget cuts resulting in tuition rising at higher rates, and with the
stock market continuing its downward spiral, KAPT could not come at a better
time.  The program's guarantee and tax-free status make it a safe and smart
investment.

Because we want to give this program the sendoff it deserves, we will launch
KAPT amidst much fanfare at a Capitol press conference on Monday, October 15
at 2 PM.  Joining us will be Governor Paul Patton, Senator Mitch McConnell,
other elected officials and dozens of Kentucky children who will share the
honor of being the first children in the state to enroll in this program.  If
you would like to be a part of this ceremony and sign up your kids or
grandkids, please e-mail us ASAP at rebeccac.comley@mail.state.ky.us.

Of course, if you cannot attend the event, we will provide you with other
ways to enroll by the December 3 deadline:

*   Visit our continually updated web site www.getKAPT.com and sign up for
the program on-line.
*   Call our toll free number 1-888-919-KAPT to receive a hard copy of the
enrollment materials in the mail.
*   Be on the lookout for the "Get KAPT Caravan" which will journey to
approximately 90 counties across the state.
*   Take note of the enrollment information provided in our ambitious
marketing campaign, which is coming to a television, radio and newspaper near
you.

On a number of levels, it is profoundly satisfying to think that on October
15, the "secret" to my family's renewed sense of security will be out.  For
us, the kickoff of KAPT represents far more than a political victory; it is
an intensely personal one.  For the first time, we can rest assured that our
daughters will one day attain diplomas without debt.  It's an indescribable
feeling of relief.  And unless you've experienced it yourself, you'll either
have to take my word for it or - get KAPT!


Best wishes,


Jonathan Miller
State Treasurer

Dear Collector,

Following the overwhelming success of our initial live and online auctions of property from The Harriman Judd Collection of British Art Pottery, we are pleased to present another fine selection of over 200 lots.  In addition to pieces from the Martin Brothers, Moorcroft, Pilkington's, and Doulton stoneware and faience, highlights include a wide selection of 20th century Wedgwood including pieces designed by Keith Murray, as well as others decorated by Alfred and Louise Powell.  In addition there are several lots of British Studio Pottery and American Art Pottery.  Click the link below to go directly to the sale.

https://news.sothebys.com/cgi-bin2/flo?y=eE840DBy5t0OX0BDaj0Aq


Beginning with the purchase of a single piece of Doulton Lambeth stoneware, Los Angeles collectors Allen Harriman and Edward Judd, amassed over a 10 year period what was probably one of the largest and most important collections of British Art pottery in public or private hands. Harriman and Judd built their collection during the 1970s and early 1980s, a period when the art works of the late 19th century were undergoing a critical reassessment.  The Harriman Judd Collection is the most important collection of its type ever to be offered at auction, and the present online sale offers opportunities for the collector that may never be seen again.   Selected works will be on exhibit at Sotheby's New York, November 24-29.   Visit the sale now; bidding ends on December 5.

https://news.sothebys.com/cgi-bin2/flo?y=eE840DBy5t0OX0BDaj0Aq


We hope you enjoy building your collection with us online.

Sincerely,

Jon King
Director of Online Auctions

Below is a brief memo about the crude P&L--there have been others.  However, I wanted you to see why Rob Fuller is so important.  Through most of his efforts, we have been winding down som very cumbersome positions, and I need him to stay with us for awhile.

Regards,

Jeff

As you can see, the crude P&L is down dramatically this quarter.  Approx. $20 million has been taken out of the portfolio and funded the internal credit reserve for Timber, etc.  Meaning this money is in the building.  

In addition, we are very aggressively getting out of physical options since we don't have the cash to fund a little over 250,000,000 physical product if we were to exercise the in the money options.  The expense is due to lack of liquidity, and few counterparties willing to trade with us.

Further, we have been aggressively reducing almost all physical inventories worldwide--dist in europe, panama, etc.  

As well, we have been taking off Asian positions, consolidating books, and pay to get flat everyday.  


While the P&L is ugly, we have been assuming that any new crude operation will be very small and are working to get there.

Please feel free to call with any questions.

Jeff

Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

Guys,

Sempra Energy Trading is not trading with us today, and they were yesterday--particularly on EOL.

Also, I just talked to Steve Semlitz, head of Hess, (Hetco) and he said he's called Tom a few times.  (Tom,he know's you're busy).  They want to take margin both ways to $0, instead of the $10 million line we have now.  

Jeff

Guys,

In response to our strategic daily meeting, here is a list of items that we discussed and we need to be prepared to review.  Please think about these and we need to fill in your views. 

For EGM:

?	List the top uses of cash by business

?	List of cash generation items in each business

?	List of cash required unwind businesses and/or positions

?	Immediate action steps

?	What items would we get rid of if there weren't any balance sheet issues?

?	Is there $ in our trading books?

?	Is there extra $ in our receivables?

?	What assets or contracts that we could sell and how fast?  Are there fire sale issues and lost value vs. taking more time?

?	What should our businesses look like in a capital constrained or cash flow metric world (look 9 months ahead)?

?	List out key contracts per business unit.

?	List of what stays and what goes in each business

?	Money is stranded in our PRM and we have no access to the markets.  How could we get some of the value for our PRM? 


Thanks,
Mike

Jeff,

Thanks for the e-mail today.  I wanted to let you know that I visited with Russell Dyk quite some time ago regarding his impressions of moving to New York in a mid-marketing role.  Just to let you know, I just moved into a financial crude trading position (approx. two months ago) working with Rich Slovenski after John Chismar transferred to London.  We are focusing on increasing the physical crude side of the business, which will present some very interesting opportunities for this group (both on the paper and physical side). Also, I am still focusing on the propane market for EnronOnline.  

Given that I've only been in this position for a few months, I would like to continue to pursue trading crude in the short-term if possible.  I don't know how that fits into the bigger picture with the Global Liquids group's objectives.  I understand the NY market is a very large market with many mid-marketing opportunities w/ the funds, and I know that Chris Mahoney was looking for someone in the London group as well in Mid-marketing. Overall, it sounds like there are quite a few interesting opportunities in the Liquid's group moving forward.

I usually stay up late watching the market.  If you'd like to give me a call, feel free to call me either at 65.737.9269 (h) or 65.9752.0196 (c).  I look forward to visiting with you soon.

Take Care,

Pat

Hi Pat,  

I understand you've been talking to our guys in NYC about marketing to the funds.  We need a strong person to do this, and I want to know what your thoughts are now, about this opportunity.

Every day it's more bills.  
Sometimes life gets too busy to really stay on top of them.
American Express(R) Bill Center can help.  
Try it and get 2,000 MEMBERSHIP REWARDS(R) bonus points.
Click here.http://www.americanexpress.com/billcenter47?aexp_em=BILLC0911 Dear Cardmember,
Let's face it.  No one likes bills. But here's a way to manage
them more easily. Even when life gets hectic.  It's called
American Express Bill Center.
You can let American Express receive, pay and organize all your
bills.  It can really simplify things:
* We'll keep your bills organized by posting them on a secure,
  password-protected Web page.  
* We can notify you by e-mail when bills come in.  And remind you
  when they're due.  
* You can set up recurring billing, so certain bills are paid
  automatically every month.
* You'll even get 2,000 MEMBERSHIP REWARDS bonus points when
  you receive and pay two bills by December 31, 2001. Just enter 
  code 8115 when you enroll.
Of course, many services offer bill payment online.  But you still
have to worry about when the bills are due.  And you have to worry
about lost or forgotten bills. For a low monthly fee, Bill Center
helps manage all that.
Cardmembers feel more in control because all their bills are posted
all in one place. And you can access your bills anywhere. Let's
say you're on a trip and haven't kept on top of things. Bill
Center gives you total access to view and pay your bills - no
matter where, no matter when. It eliminates the stress of putting
it off and having to worry about overdue bills.  Managing bills can
be as easy as a few clicks.
Bill Center helps keep you in control. Try it and see for yourself.
Sincerely,
Pierric Beckert
Senior Vice President

I put in a call to Mark Kennedy. I think I know how this will work, but I
want to talk to Mark to make sure everything is clear. I will let you know
as soon as I talk with him.  I do think two checks will be better if that is
no problem

On another matter, please don't forget we want your photograph and a few
paragraphs about your experience and why you established the funds. We want
to publish this in the bulletin.

Glad I got to meet you and I think everyone really enjoyed Larry's
anniversary.  Afterwards,  I heard another retiring doctor ask Rabbi Rapport
if he could study for his bar mitzvah.

Best regards,

Hi Phil, It was nice meeting you at Larry's bar mitzvah anniversary at
the Temple a few weeks ago.  I was hoping you could help me with one
more thing.  I've spoken with Mr Kennedy (I think) from bank of
Lousiville, and I was a little confused after I hung up the phone.  As
you know the 2 gifts of $50,000 each are for separate awards, etc.  Does
Bank of Louisville know this? Or is it kept track of differently through
the Temple.  I ask because when I told him both "scholarships" or funds
were open to future additions via donations to them from whomever, he
wasn't sure what I was talking about.  Should I make out 2 checks for
$50k each payable to the Temple of Bank of Louisville?  Or 1 check for
the total?  Any help would be appreciated as I'm anxious to get these
open for future contributions.

Best regards,

Jeff

Eric:

Clay Harris and I met with the Venezuelan Ambassador this afternoon and reiterated our interest in arranging a meeting for Enron with President Chavez, who will visit the UK during 21-24 October.  The ambassador responded initially that Chavez's schedule had been "set for months" and that changing the schedule would be difficult.  After further discussion, he said Chavez would certainly be interested in discussing the project, and that they might be able to make time on the schedule at about 1100 hours on Tuesday 23 Oct.  We provided a brief overview of the status of the project, and he asked that we provide as soon as possible names and bio information for whoever would meet with Chavez if this comes off.  He promised to get back to us as quick as he can.  Please let us know who will be available from Houston for a possible Tuesday morning meeting here.  Thanks.

Jeff,

I have attached a presentation that outlines our current analysis concerning TOCOM and the other markets in Japan.  This presentation should be looked at as linked to the presentation concerning Nissho Iwai sent out last Wednesday.  I would suggest that you look at the other presentation first.  NIC helps provide us with the local market insight that would take real time for us to develop on our own.  I believe that the local trading markets are interesting and worth Enron moving forward with.  What you will see as you look at these presentations is in fact a call for an overall Asian strategy for EGM.  I think that this office and the outlines provided can form the seed and the way forward to accomplish this.

I look forward to going through the details of this presentation.

Joe

Mike/Jeff,

An indication of real cooperation between EJ and Enron Coal.  We received the signed engagement letter from NIC yesterday to proceed with this transaction.  Also good for our coal guys to see that NIC is delivering us deals and value.  Enron Coal to take offtake, EJ arranging financing, structuring and insurance.

Subject:	Wallarah - update

Just a quick update on the captioned.

Furusho-san (deputy of NIC-Coal) met with Excel today in Australia and found the below.
(1) Excel likes the transaction structure and wants to proceed further.
(2) Excel wants to have A$15 million financing from NIC on limited-recourse basis.
(3) Excel can undertake the availability of back-up coal supply from Wambo in case of Wallarah's low performance.
(4) Excel finds 360,000 ton too much in light of Wallarah and Wambo's excess capacity and required financing amount. Indication was 100,000ton (if the size is larger, back-up arrangement from Wambo involves additional cost; and Delta may want to buy up to 1 million ton).
(5) Excel, however, can entertain option contracts with Enron (cal + put) for say, 200,000 ton.

I met NEXI today with Sasaki-san.
NEXI was positive on the transaction including NIC's credit, although there are some reservations such as having a SPC as a beneficiary, and use of pre-paid proceeds.

Actions to follow.
(1) Find realistic coal purchase conditions (Tark, will 100,000 too small ? Shall we include some Wambo coal in addition to 100,000 Wallarah's ?)
(2) Prepare a dirty cash flow (Aman, let's talk tomorrow. half-done cashflow is attached below.)
(3) Speak to NEXI (Sasaki-san, we need to re-educate Fujiwara, again on the structure)

 
Furusho will meet Excel tomorrow again at 5:00pm. Furusho will visit Tark at 1:30pm to have a discussion on this (I will join thru. phone. Sasaki-san, do you have time at 2:30?)

It strikes me that this is all getting a bit rediculous.  If you need ECAP deals signed, George McClellan or I can sign by fax.  I don't want Paul McPhee to sign as resident director until he has been around for a while.  At present, Jez would be the most qualified in Sydney.

What problem are you trying to solve here?  ECAP obligations require cash from the parent  - do you think Paul McPhee is going to have a better idea about the parent company's solvency than you will?  Houston (i.e. the parent company) is telling us business as usual - do you feel that Shankman's approval is not enough for you to fulfill your duties to the Australian entity?  Please clarify, as this seems to be making everything exceedingly difficult.

Thanks,

Stu

Stu

Prior to this particular issue of today, I had discussed with Melissa and intended to email you this week on the idea of Paul McPhee taking over as the resident director of ECAP. As you would remember, the only reason I had the role was the need for a resident to have the role and issues at the time with the only qualifier on the desk. Clearly it will be far efficient for all involved to have someone closer to the business in the role and also a better control as he will be far more familiar with the deals. 

Please let me know if this does not suit, otherwise I will have one of our lawyers do the paperwork when Paul starts next week.

Regards

Heidi

Jez our concerns are not just an internal approval issue. Under Australian Law the Directors of ECAPPL need to be satisfied when a company incurs a debt that it can be paid. Failure to discharge this duty can mean the directors would be personally for the debt. If the Coal Group is comfortable to make to enter into these commitments   then that is the obvious way forward. One of the Coal Group in the Sydney office (presumably Paul McPhee) could replace Heidi Mason as resident director.

We seem to be going round in circle's here and hence hopefully all the relevant people are now on copy of this e-mail so we can resolve swiftly. This cargo is due to be shipped in seven days with the coal already being railed to port. It is coal which will be shipped to service European commitments and represents the cheapest way to do so taking all costs into account (including financing). Needless to say if we pull out of this deal at this stage it will have huge ramifications with our customer and send all the wrong signals to our counterparties in this part of the world. Last but not least we will need to look elsewhere to procure coal for these European sales at what is likely to be a higher price.

Appreciate the green light.

It has been made clear to me that Jeff Shankman needs to clear this transaction through Bill Bradford and Louise Kitchen prior to any capital going out the door.  It is my understanding that this has not been done.

George:

Details on the cargo we are loading out of Newcastle.  Sailing time is roughly 45 days.  Cargo to be sold to ARA/German customers, most with payment terms 5 days post delivery.  Also - it would help to get an idea of how diificult this exercise will be in the coming months, as we have a couple more loading before year end.

Work it,

Stu

Stu,

I refer to your e-mail to Jez last week and advise you the expected payment value and timing etc.

Vessel name:	MV "Cotsworld"
ETA:		21/Nov 
ETS:		22/Nov
Loading tonnage: approx. 128kmt (9kmt from Stratford and 119kmt from Bengalla)
Payment value and timing :	
		Value		Timing	
 Bengalla:	US$3.3mil(*)	19th (**)
 Stratford:	US$0.2mil(*)	26th  		

* Inclusive of 10% GST
** Bengall has already delivered 49kmt of coal to port and will complete the delivery on 15th. 
The contract is based on FIS and the invoice weight and quality be determined by the inbound analysis while they take des/dem risk.
Because of their concern over our credit Bengalla has insisted on our payment by TT against the presentation of documents. Docs are likely to be 
presented on 16th or 19th at the latest. 

The draft contract which Bengalla has confirmed has a provision that the invoice weight is determined based on B/L quantity instead of inbound rail weight 
if we take 100% of Bengalla coal onto our vessel. If we do that, they can not present their docs until the vessel has compeleted the loading and our payment date would be say 26th instead.

Regards,


Tark

Effective Monday, October 22, 2001 the following changes will be made to the Autohedge functionality on EnronOnline.

The volume on the hedge will now respect the minimum volume and volume increment settings on the parent product. See rules below: 

?	If the transaction volume on the child is less than half of the parent's minimum volume no hedge will occur.
?	If the transaction volume on the child is more than half the parent's minimum volume but less than half the volume increment on the parent, the hedge will volume will be the parent's minimum volume.
?	For all other volumes, the same rounding rules will apply based on the volume increment on the parent product.

Please see example below:

Parent's Settings:
Minimum: 	5000
Increment:  1000

Volume on Autohedge transaction			Volume Hedged
1      - 2499							0
2500 - 5499							5000

Rick,

As you know we have stopped our agricultural commodity businesses, and therefore do not need any VAR associated with these businesses.  If this VAR is allocated to EGM, I would like to reallocate it within the business unit.  If VAR is approved for specific businesses, EGM will give this VAR back to Corp.

As well, I would like to reclass all softs, grains, and meats on the DPR as "other" and remove those headings.

Thanks

Jeff

Dear friends,

We have (hastily) scheduled our first executive committee meeting of the new
fiscal year for THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 6 AT 4:00 AT THE MUSEUM.

Please forgive this short notice which is necessary as it became clear that
Mrs. Ballard, Chair, would be out of town for much of the month of September
and we need to have an executive committee meeting in advance of the
September 10 meeting of the Board of Trustees.

At the Thursday meeting, we'll create a schedule for executive committee
meetings for the year, as well as establish a time and place for the
meetings which is mutually convenient.

Last year, the committee met once a month on Wednesdays at the Bayou Club
which proved to work well for everyone.

Please let Cheryl know if you will be able to attend Thursday's meeting.
You may reach her at 713 284 8253 or by email to bliss@camh.org.

Thanks and I hope to see you Thursday.

Mike and Jeff,

As of last Wednesday, I didn't think I would have enough information to share to warrant a meeting; however, today, I think I have enough questions for the B.U. heads and possibly enough answers to warrant the meeting.

I have contacted most by phone tonight and have left messages for others.  I think most of the direct reports will be prepared to attend and discuss the questions I have.

If Cathy will arrange for us to have the meeting, I would appreciate it.

Shanna

Hi Sarah,

Thanks for the fax about the dunand tea set.  I'm still doing some research into it.  Do you have an idea when I should expect the Fedex of the two pieces I bought about 10 days ago.  I'll be out of the office next week, but you may comminicate with my asst Jennifer Burns at 1-713 853 9440 when to expect it.

Best Regards,

Given the current uncertainty surrounding capital allocation I wanted to highlight that we have one remaining commitment to CLP before the end of this calendar year - last half Dec shipment of 70,000mt.

All things being equal we would be looking to source this cargo from China as they still represent the cheapest origin of coal for this business. However, as you are aware all
payment on contracts out of China are currently done via L/C and we are unlikely to be able to change in short-term, especially given the current focus. If we were to look to Australia to procure this shipment then there is a better chance of procuring coal with payment via T.T (although some producers are talking about L/C requirements given today's situation), however we will be paying a premium for this coal. Economics are as follows:

Sourcing from China - $31.00 delivered Hong Kong - approx
Sourcing from Oz     - $32.50 delivered Hong Kong - approx

Given abve we would like to concentrate on stemming from China but obviously some L/C capacity will be required. - total value would be approx $2mill
Please advise where we stand on this.

FYI - we are currently working on a buy back deal with CLP whereby we purchase 280mmt of our commitment to supply for first half of 2002 - this will reduce our working capital requirements.

Appreciate your thoughts

Per notification from Jim Prentice it appears the Enron methanol plant will=
 cease production this Friday. Global Products has made arrangements to pur=
chase our methanol feedstock requirements from outside sources once we have=
 taken the balance of the methanol production at the plant. We have been wo=
rking with John Goodpasture to purchase the methanol tanks at the Enron met=
hanol plant for our future methanol feedstock storage. These tanks are able=
 to store in excess of 400,000 barrels. We are still waiting for an indicat=
ive price on the tanks and the latest was a comment from Prentice who said =
Clean Fuels needs to do their fiduciary duty and check the market for the t=
anks' value. Since these tanks are probably on their books at zero we are h=
opeful that they would offer us a favorable price. The only other issue is =
that the dock leading to/from the tanks is owned by Oxy and we would need a=
 long term arrangement with Oxy to utilize their dock to access the tanks. =
Again, Goodpasture was checking with Oxy on this issue. In addition, EOTT i=
s willing to operate the facility, if necessary.

Mike--could you please contact Stan Horton and get him to engage in the dis=
cussions so we can move the process forward and have Clean Fuels offer us a=
 price on the tanks? This is important because we will soon be bringing in =
cargoes/barges in excess of the methanol tankage at the Morgan's Pt. MTBE p=
lant and we will need a place to store it.

Mark Tawney indicated that, while it might be a long shot, Lynda might be interested in a core group of people (smaller than all EJ obviously) that would be able to help her build a weather business in Japan.  Do you think there is any merit in this?  If so, let me know the best way to progress, including, if you have it, her phone number.

As you guys go through working up a severance program, I started thinking about some equity issues.  If the average tenure of an employee at Enron is about 3 years, why not come up with 2 plans--1 for long serving employees who have been long dedicated to the company, and a second one for the more recently hired?  It doesnt' make sense to me that someone who has been here under a year at $100,000 base should be entitled to 11 weeks even before they sign the waiver.  I would also not change the program in whatever form you ultimately settle on for the longer serving employees, rather just scale back the program for the newer employees.

I'm guessing no.  Government bills aren't numbered as indicated below.  The current Senate bill 602 is the "Common Sense Federal Election Reform Act of 2001"; current House bill 602 is "Genetic Nondiscrimination in Health Insurance and Employment Act."  No email stuff in either one, I would assume.  The only email related bill is HR2281 "The Digital Divide Elimination Act of 2001."  This relates to tax credits to help lower-income people buy computers.  I can't find a record of any "Representative Tony Schnell."  I would also note that the Washington magazine is a monthly, not a weekly as suggested below.

Also, most "PLEASE FORWARD TO EVERYONE YOU KNOW!!!" emails are hoaxes.  This was a fun test- got any more?!

Subject:	New Maddie Pics with Our New Digital Camera

Hi folks,  We're looking for something to do on this
sweltering day such that we don't have to leave our
airconditioned bedroom.  Thought you'd all like to see
what Maddie's been up to lately.  As you can see in
some of the pics, she cut herself under her right eye
falling down the stairs in front of our house.  She's
posing in front of the offending bricks in one photo.
She's fine and hopes you all haven't fallen down any
stairs recently.

The Lessers

Yep. Problematic, but I agree with your sentiment. Bottom-line we go with current 52 week plan or reduced 39 week plan. Consistent qualification. Board need to approve anything else.

As you guys go through working up a severance program, I started thinking about some equity issues.  If the average tenure of an employee at Enron is about 3 years, why not come up with 2 plans--1 for long serving employees who have been long dedicated to the company, and a second one for the more recently hired?  It doesnt' make sense to me that someone who has been here under a year at $100,000 base should be entitled to 11 weeks even before they sign the waiver.  I would also not change the program in whatever form you ultimately settle on for the longer serving employees, rather just scale back the program for the newer employees.

Regards,

Jeff

Donnis,
 
At $500 per month, ith will take you 23 months to repay me, which I am not willing to do.  I need assurance that you will repay me.  I don't understand what you mean when you say you need a little more time to have this resolved--please clarify.
 
Thanks for your reply this morning.

Hi Donnis, 

I know it has been hard selling the land, but we need to come up with a payment schedule, or your will need to give me the land valued at $11,500.  What do you prefer.  In light of the difficult times at the company these days, I'd like to get this resolved.

Thanks for understanding.

Hi Donnis,
 
Congratulations on the land sale.  Can I get a copy of the sale papers for my files, so I have some written assurances that you will be able to pay me back?  Thanks for understanding, and I'm glad to help.

I have good news.  I have the land sold but will not get the money until the last week of December.  If the deal closes sooner, I will get the money to you asap.
 
I just want you to know that I appreciate everything that you have done for me and especially the opportunities you have given Jennifer.

Jeff:

FYI, this is a concept we are thinking about.  The following was written by Shawn to his staff, but the basic idea is to buy, or gain control of medium sized trucking companies $5-25mm/yr revenue.  We would either keep the current owner involved as described below, or work with an operating partner who would control all the truck leases, drivers and maintenance.  We would take back a contract for the capacity (mix of variable and fixed price) and would retain all existing sales contracts.  Under either structure, we get access to the existing customer relationships and channels.

Once we get a little further down the line, I'd like Shawn and Kellie to present it to you and Mike.

Regards,

Dan

===========================================================================================

In my mind, the typical demographic of a good target would be someone:

who has built a solid and profitable trucking company of midsize
who has build a loyal book of business with financially sound shippers over a 10 to 20 year period
who is seeking some retirement liquidity (capitalise on the goodwill) and has no one to pass the business on to
who can stay around for a migration period of 1-3 years, so that the book gradually moves to EFM (on a spot, then firm basis)
possibly someone whose business could even be bigger if Enron were partnered with them because of added credibility with the inclusion of Enron
maybe who may have run into some unavoidable problems (such as hit by high insurance), but depends on whether they have preserved valuable relationships

One of the possible structures Kellie and I have been discussing is:

some Initial Payment is made to Truckco for signing the implementation plan agreement with EFM
at that time EFM is given a call option to buy out the equity of Truckco within 18-36 months from now (we could also give them a put to EFM at a lower price)
the implementation plan calls for Truckco management to do certain things over the ensuing periods, including migrating and routing their business through EFM
milestone payments for certain events such as (1) moving accounts to EFM or an EFM/Truckco JV and (2) transforming the contracts from spot to our M2M firm basis (different payments depending upon the value of the deal for us)
during the migration period, we will back-to-back the original customers with the Truckco; and compensation to Truckco for any spread could be contained in some combination of the Initial Payment and milestone payments
I assume that the JV between EFM/Truckco may be able to preserve the existing relationships and possibly increase the size because of the scale that Enron brings (ie grow the existing business)
at the exercise date of the equity options, we can decide whether to (1) exercise and own the Truckco; (2) sell the Truckco to a larger trucking company; (3) retire the trucks and sell the terminals and satisfy the customer volumes in other ways (from other carriers, from our portfolio, or just remain short and cover in the spot market)

I'm sure that Kellie is considering other possible structures as well.

We really need to get something like this launched as soon as possible, as we have a target of $6M of income for this 3Q.

Again, lets visit with Kellie and her team.  She is assembling a list of target companies.

Shawn

Jeff,
 
If you could loan me the $5000, I can have that paid back to you by the first of November.  I have someone who wants the 5 acres but will not close on his house until the end of October.  I hope you will consider.  This would be the first time for me to ever own a home.  I don't have any other way of making this happen.
 
I want let you down.  This is a once in a lifetime deal for me.  I have so much to gain by this.  If I ever had to sell the house, it is worth $145,000.
 
Thanks,
 
Donnis

As EGM concludes its first year of business, we have shown that there is real health, success and future opportunities for our businesses.  Our importance to the success of Enron is clear.  Now we would like to review our first year.  In your presentations at the off-site meeting next week, Mike and I would like each of the presenters to outline the following: your business' biggest success and biggest failure; what was different from original market observations, and did this help or hurt business; lessons learned and what you would do differently; and your best opportunities for next year.  I know that time is short but hopefully this will not be too difficult with your recent 2002 plan work.  

Please prepare your presentation in PowerPoint with a simple format and no graphics or background. Each presenter will be given approximately 30 minutes to speak. All PowerPoint files are due to Jennifer Burns via email by no later than 1:00pm on Monday, October 15.

Thank you,
Mike and Jeff

I don't have all the facts to agree or disagree.  Until John Z has approval to trade currency, I wouldn't think you would want to go down this path.  In addition, I'm sure  you know hegding currency this big and late of Fridays is tough.

Given the volatility in the gas market (which is the sole impact on the Canadian power book's US dollar exposure) and the exhorbitant cost involved in hedging multi-year cashflows (i.e. as evidenced by Friday 10/19/2001 trade of -$1,200,000 Cdn new deal value for the 14 year swap that I entered into), I will manage the currency exposure of this book myself, I will hedge appropriately when I see fit and will not accept hedges forced on Enron Canada because of arbitrary position limits set by your department.

GLOBAL INVESTING: 'Business as usual' for weather derivatives 
Financial Times; Nov 15, 2001
By ALISON BEARD

When Enron, the energy trading company, became mired in controversy late last month, weather derivatives buyers were in danger of losing one of their top three market makers. But trading has not skipped a beat, according to industry sources.
"So far it's been business as usual," said Tom Stus, a trader at Axia Energy, which also sells risk protection to companies that depend on the weather, such as amusement park operators and ski resort owners.
"At one time Enron was a pretty significant player, but since they've been involved with these problems, they've probably slipped to the top 10 in terms of volume.
"We haven't seen them much in the over-the-counter market," he added. "But they're still online."
Dynegy, the company that plans to acquire Enron, also trades weather derivatives, as do a host of other commodity firms, insurers and some brokerages. Goldman Sachs, the Wall Street bank, and XL Capital, the Bermuda-based insurer, for example, recently entered the market, picking up Enron's slack, Mr Stus said.
"There's been no effect whatsoever," said Ravi Nathan, general manager at Aquila, another energy trader. "This market has a lot of capacity available."

As you guys go through working up a severance program, I started thinking about some equity issues.  If the average tenure of an employee at Enron is about 3 years, why not come up with 2 plans--1 for long serving employees who have been long dedicated to the company, and a second one for the more recently hired?  It doesnt' make sense to me that someone who has been here under a year at $100,000 base should be entitled to 11 weeks even before they sign the waiver.  I would also not change the program in whatever form you ultimately settle on for the longer serving employees, rather just scale back the program for the newer employees.

Regards,

Jeff

Dear Jeff,

How are you? Hope you had a nice weekend. Will you be kind enough to give me some idea of the schedule after you talk to the head of Japan today? I can assure you I will do a good job there. 

Will you please go to the Wharton undergrad reception next Monday? They will love to have you there. I am going too, let's have more fun!

All the best!

I know this is long, but worth your time to read. I met with Brent to maker sure he was fully informed of our plans to recognize revenue connected with Jim Bouillion's Corporate Risk Management activities. Brent agrees with all of the below and I am proceeding with booking each deal for Q$ as described. It means a plus to gross margin in MPR of just under $2 million for Q4. This does not include the double trigger or any value from Doug Jone's muni deal if it comes off this quarter.  In addition, I'll be taking a negative charge (reduction) in expense for the quarter of just over $1 million, recooping all of our peaker expenses plus a little of our own direct time and expense.

Any questions please give me a call and I'd be happy to go into more detail.

Brent, I thought it would be helpful to supply some background for our meeting today at 1:30PM. My objective is to make sure you are fully up to speed on what we are doing, the accounting treatment we are using, and Corp's position on it all.

A little background. Since January, I have been working with Jim Bouillion's Corporate Risk Management team to create trading revenue through the proactive management of our corporate insurance needs --- what we are now calling Portfolio Management Revenue and booking to the MPR. Two examples of this which we pushed through in the 3Q follow below:

A.	1 transaction booked trading our political risk insurance book for total value of $716,000. Received risk sharing premium by modifying deductible, stop loss limits, 	coverage diversification and country diversification covered	under OPIC and with our commercial coverage and risk retention in our Vermont captive. P&L Reported:

	Reported MPR		$  716,000

B.	1 transaction booked for Hainan, China for total value of $ 406,000. Cancelled original stand alone insurance	policy with limited currency convertibility coverage and 	reissued coverage through Enron Re for lower premium, saving business unit $75,000, and better coverage. Reinsured Enron Re through commercial program and
	netted $406,000. P&L Reported:

	Reported MPR		$  406,000


For the 4Q we have a number of similar transactions going through. The fundamental business change I'm trying to implement is to have each Enron business unit pay market prices for their insurance cover, leaving IRM's Corporate Risk Management team the incentive to capture insurance risk trading revenues by dynamically managing the risk on an aggregated basis. Historically, any work Jim's team did was considered expense reduction and was simply refunded to Corp or directly to the business units. I consider this risk management activity to be no different than any commodity trading book at Enron where the risk manager (trader) keeps the value they create by trading efficiently in the market. Our market just happens to be insurance and our bid/offer spread is the difference between insurance and reinsurance premiums. These transactions are an effort to test the concept and push the system. 

The transactions we expect to push through in Q4 are:

C.	1 transaction to be booked as the second instalment of "A" above. The OPIC risk sharing premium was split into two payments over 3Q and 4Q.

	To be reported to MPR	$700,000

D.	1 transaction to be booked in our property insurance book. It is connected with EES's acquisition of Limbach. The market price for their insurance coverage is $400,000 which is being charged to them.  By placing the property asset physical damage coverage in the property program, we get automatic coverage for new acquisitions (up to certain values). The insurance market only charges when significant values are added or if the asset acquired is of a different nature than the mix already in the portfolio, for example, the paper mill acquisitions have generated a charge.

	To be reported to MPR	$400,000

E.	1 transaction to be booked capturing the value of our property coverage with Aegis and Energy Insurance Mutual. The insurance coverage essentially has a dividend option built into it based on Aegis's or EIM's overall loss experience during the year. These dividends are like going long options on loss experience and were captured by Corporate Risk Management's selection of dividend generating markets to write the coverage. (AEGIS also writes one of the broadest policy forms in the market and is very competitive on price.) 
	To be reported to MPR	$893,000

In addition. there is 1 transaction related to the sale of ENA assets (the Peakers) which normally would not have resulted in a property insurance refund. Jim's team negotiated with the underwriters and won a concession to recognize a reduction in premium midway through the year. The property program is an umbrella facility which gives us flexibility to move assets in and out of the program subject to the total value of the property and classification (hence the income recognized in "D"). We couldn't come up with a good defence for why this should be treated as revenue so we decided to take it in as a negative expense and avoid possible questions down the road. The total value we'll credit to expenses will be approx. $1.012 million. In addition, our group had over $600,000 of peaker transaction expenses that we were not reimbursed for when the insurance market transaction we were pursuing had to be cancelled after the sale of the assets.  

Karen has had a number of conversations with the Enron Corp acctg group. They do not have issues with the portfolio mgmt revenue as it is still below their materiality scope, somewhere around $5 million.
Hope this helps set the stage for our discussion this afternoon.

Below is a summary of my discussion w/ Norman Abood (General Counsel for GAF) in response to our termination letter dated 10/16/01 and his written response on 10/17.  Basically, I told Norman it was time to stop the paper trail and either get down to closing or go our separate ways.  I emphasized our primary concerns as follows:
  
	1.  GAF's ability to fund its equity
	2.  finalizing the feedstock supply and products off-take
	3.  Morgan's commitment to finance the debt 
	4.  defining the pool of assets to be collateralized
	5.  evidence of insurability, and 
	6.  restructuring of GAF's PSA w/ Farmland.

I also emphasized our frustration over the "continually moving targets" (debt, collateral, equity, feedstocks, etc...) and told him I will NOT continue to expend resources and time playing games.  Finally, I told him I was willing to re-engage on the following terms:

	a.  GAF submit either a written set of comments to our 9/21 MOU or a counter-proposal to us by Monday, 10/22.
	b.  If, subject to OUR review and based on US believing there's merit to proceed that we get ALL PARTIES (GAF, 	     Morgan Stanley and EGM) together and hammer out a definitive and final version of the MOU including, but not 		     limited to the primary concerns above (w/ all parties having "subject to senior management and/or Board approval" 	     language/conditions).  The purpose here is to get all the T&C down in writing with everyone in the room in 	     conceptual agreement which will make it more difficult for the targets to move.
	c.  Morgan Stanley must be willing to sign some form of commitment letter evidencing their willingness to finance the 	     transaction.

GAF will then have some finite/specific period of time in which to approach Farmland and restructure their deal as necessary to close the transaction.

Norman agreed in principle and committed to get back to us by tomorrow.  Hopefully, this will once and for all define whether or not this deal can get done.

You really should take a sabbatical from COO and just come and run the whole thing. Clearly you are the only one who understands the nuts and bolts of trade till liquidation.

Jeff,
 
Point of interest--not sure if you're aware . . . 
 
Vikas Dwivedi, formerly an associate at Enron, recently left our company to work for Carol Coale at Prudential.

Delores is copying the last few months and has set up the system such that you are the approver on all future expense reports.

Just confirmed with Nowlan's admin that you are the approver in XMS -( the expense report system) - for both Nowlan and Schroeder.

Delores will also make you copies of the past two months' reports for both.

I was wondering if you might be able to help me.  I need to finish strong
this year.  I am attempting to reach the goal of $336,000 in clothing sales
by the end of the year.  Obviously, no single client will be able to help me
do this.  So I was wondering if you might be able to help me out by giving
me the names of some qualified gentlemen or ladies that might be interested
in the type of service we offer.

Some things to consider:

We offer ready-made (off the rack) clothing as well as custom.
We offer all types of men's clothing including casual.

If you know of some mid to upper level executive women, they may have an
interest as well.

Some memory joggers:

Who is the best dressed man or woman you know?
Who do you know that likes nice cars?
Who do you know that owns their own company?
Who do you know that is successful in sales?
Who do you know that wears an expensive watch?
Who do you know that owns their own airplane?
Who do you know that might have a hard time fitting in typical clothing?

Thanks for your help!

All I can say is, "Oh f------ck."  To be determined about me.  All I know is I could have retired next summer, now I have to work for a few more, maybe serveral more, years.  Now I REALLY need to find a REALLY rich girl.  As Robyn Leach says, "Caviar dreams, and champagne wishes..."--that was so last year.  (By the way, he's my hero)
The whole thing is ugly, but I'm sure I'll end up OK.

How are you, and the bambina?  Where are you all going to end up?

Hey Jeff:

What's going on at Enron and, more importantly, what does it mean for you?

How are you in general and what's up?

Stefanie

P.S. WHAT THE HELL IS DAVE HERMAN'S E-MAIL ADDRESS???!!!!!

Dear Jeff: 
It was truly our pleasure having you over. It was fun to visit and hear your stories. The triangle chair is by Archizoom and was in production from 1968 to 1976 by Paltronova in Italy. I will try to track one down for you. I will email them tonight in Italy.  
Thanks for looking up the plated silver "glove" box. You are good.............. 
Linda and I would always love to see you. We'll give you a call in the next couple of weeks. I assume I'll see you Monday night at the Design Council. I am trying to track down some Desne pieces that we talked about. I located a vase in NYC. They are sending me an image. I will show it to you when I get it. I am actually beginning to focus on the cocktail set or a bowl. No luck yet. The real fun is the education and research. The hunt is the best part. 
I found an article through Cindi about Desne, but no book. I didn't realize they were in production only from 1929-1937. To me they achieved a great aesthetic in a vibrant time period.  
I hope you are holding up well at work. I know the top of the mountain looks high from the valley. I wish you luck. We're off to Austin tomorrow and we'll be back wednesday. I'm glad you're here for a couple of weeks.  
See you soon, 
Peter

Figure you are pretty busy, so I did want to bother you.
Give me a call when things calm down
