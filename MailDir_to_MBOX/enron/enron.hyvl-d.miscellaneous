FEMALE HORMONES IN BEER

Yesterday, scientists for Health Canada suggested that men should take a
look
at their beer consumption, considering the results of a recent analysis that

revealed the presence of female hormones in beer. The theory is that
drinking
beer makes men turn into women.

To test the finding, 100 men were fed 6 pints of beer each. It was then
observed that 100% of the men gained weight, talked excessively without
making
sense, became overly emotional, couldn't drive, failed to think rationally,
argued over nothing and refused to apologize when wrong. No further testing
is
planned.

 LET'S MAKE SOME COOKIES!!!

THIS IS A TRUE STORY

A little background: Neiman-Marcus, if you
 don't know already is a very
expensive store i.e. they sell your typical
 $8.00 t-shirt for $50.00.Lets let them have it!!!
My daughter and I had just finished a salad
at a Neiman-Marcus Cafe
 in Dallas and decided to have a small dessert. Because
 both of us are such
 cookie lovers, we decided to try the "Neiman-Marcus
Cookie." It was so excellent
 that I asked if they would give me the recipe
 and the waitress said with a
small frown, "I'm afraid not but, you can buy
 the recipe."

 Well, I asked how much, and she responded,
"Only two fifty, it's a great deal!" I agreed with approval, just add it to
 my tab I told her. Thirty days later, I received my VISA statement and it was
 $285.00. I looked again and
 I remembered I had only spent $9.95 for two salads and about $20.00
 for a scarf. As I glanced at the bottom of the
 statement, it said, Cookie Recipe -$250.00" That was outrageous!

I called Neiman's Accounting Dept. and told them the waitress said it
 was "two-fifty," which clearly does not mean "twohundred and fifty dollars"
by any *POSSIBLE* interpretation of the phrase.= Neiman-Marcus
 refused to budge.They would not refund my money, because
 according to them, "What the
 waitress told you is not our problem. You have already seen the
 recipe. We absolutely will not refund you money at this point."

 I explained to her the criminal statues which
 govern fraud in Texas. I threatened to refer them to The Better
 Business Bureau and the State Attorney General Office for engaging in fraud.
I was basically told,"Do what you want, it doesn't matter, we're not refunding
 your money." I waited, thinking of how I could get even, or even try and get 
any
 of my money back.
 I just said, "Okay, you folks got my $250, and now I'm going to have
 $250.00 worth of fun."
 I told her that I was going to see to it that every Cookie lover in
the United States with an e-mail account has a $250.00 cookie recipe from
 Neiman-Marcus...for free. She replied, "I wish you wouldn't do this." I
said, "Well, you should have thought of that before you ripped me off," and
 slammed down the phone on her.

So here it is!!! Please, please, please pass it on to everyone youcan
 possibly think of. I paid $250 for this...I don't want Neiman-Marcus
to *ever* get another penny off of this recipe....

 NEIMAN MARCUS COOKIES (Recipe may be halved)
2 cups butter
 4 cups flour
2 tsp. soda
 2 cups sugar
 5 cups blended oatmeal ***
24 oz. chocolate chips
 2 cups brown sugar
 1 tsp. salt
 4 eggs
1 - 8 oz. Hershey Bar (grated
 2 tsp. baking powder
 2 tsp. vanilla
3 cups chopped nuts (your choice)

* Measure oatmeal and blend in a blender to a fine powder.
 * Cream the butter and both sugars.
 * Add eggs and vanilla, mix together with flour, oatmeal, salt, baking 
powder, and soda.
 * Add chocolate chips, Hershey Bar and nuts.

 Roll into balls and place two inches apart on
 a cookie sheet.
* Bake for 10 minutes at 375 degrees.
 * Makes 112 cookies.

 PLEASE READ IT AND SEND TO EVERY PERSON YOU
KNOW WHO HAS AN E-MAIL
ADDRESS!
 THIS IS REALLY TERRIFIC!

 Have fun!!! This is not a joke-this is a true
story. Ride free,
 citizens

   Health Tips and News
   The Straight Dope On Food, Health, & Exercise:

   Q: I've heard that cardiovascular exercise can prolong life. Is this
 true?
   A: Your heart is only good for so many beats, and that's it. Everything
  wears out eventually. Speeding up your heart will not make you live
 longer;
  that's like saying you can extend the life of your car by driving it
  faster.  Want to live longer? Take a nap.

   Q: Should I cut down on meat and eat more fruits and vegetables?
   A: You must grasp logistical efficiencies. What does a cow eat? Hay and
  corn. And what are these? Vegetables. So a steak is nothing more than an
  efficient mechanism of delivering vegetables to your system. Need grain?
  Eat chicken. Beef is also a good source of field grass (green leafy
  vegetable). And a pork chop can give you 100% of your recommended daily
  allowance of vegetable slop.

   Q: Is beer or wine bad for me?
   A: Look, it goes to the earlier point about fruits and vegetables. As we
  all know, scientists divide everything in the world into three categories=
:
  animal, mineral, and vegetable. We all know that beer and wine are not
  animal, and they are not on the periodic table of elements, so that only
  leaves one thing, right? My advice: Have a burger and a beer and enjoy
 your
  liquid vegetables.

   Q: How can I calculate my body/fat ratio?
   A: Well, if you have a body, and you have body fat, your ratio is one to
  one. If you have two bodies, your ratio is two to one, etc.

    Q: At the gym, a guy asked me to "spot" for him while he did the bench
  press. What did he mean?
   A: "Spotting" for someone means you stand over him while he blows air up
  your shorts. It's an accepted practice at health clubs; though if you fin=
d
  that it becomes the ONLY reason why you're going in, you probably ought t=
o
  reevaluate your exercise program.

   Q: What are some of the advantages of participating in a regular exercis=
e
  program?
   A: Can't think of a single one, sorry.  My philosophy is: No Pain-No
 Pain.

   Q: If I stop drinking, will I live longer?
   A: Nope. Drinking enhances individual expression and peace of mind. If
  you stop, you'll probably stress yourself to death in record time.

   Q: Aren't fried foods bad for you?
   A: You're not listening. Foods are fried these days in vegetable oil. In
  fact, they're permeated in it. How could getting more vegetables be
 bad for
  you?

   Q: What's the secret to healthy eating?
   A: Thicker gravy.

   Q: Will sit-ups help prevent me from getting a little soft around the
  middle?
   A: Definitely not! When you exercise a muscle, it gets bigger. You shoul=
d
  only be doing sit-ups if you want a bigger stomach.

  I hope this has cleared up any misconceptions you may have had.

Subject: Survivor

CBS is showing "Survivor 2" this winter. In response, Texas is planning
"Survivor, Texas Style."

The contestants will start in Dallas, travel through Waco, Austin, San
Antonio, down to Houston and Brownsville. They will proceed up to Del Rio,
on to El Paso, then to Midland/Odessa, up to Lubbock and Amarillo. From
there, they proceed to Abilene, and on to Ft. Worth and back to Dallas.

Each will be driving a pink Volvo, with a bumper sticker that reads "I'm
gay, I voted for Al Gore, and I'm here to confiscate your guns."

The first one to make it back to Dallas wins.

Good morning. We repeated the MMSE test this week. Mom did  much better this 
time. Still has trouble with short term memory, but she drew  the clock 
correct this time. It looks like the medicine is holding things okay.  The 
doctor talked with her briefly about banking needs and finances, so she  
shouldn't be surprised if we bring up the subject.? She (the doctor) told  
her that her concern was of someone taking advantage of her,(strangers, 
etc.)  since she may not remember that she had already paid for something and 
try to do  it again.
?Still planning to get together Sat. June 2. Mom thinks  she is going out for 
her birthday so I don't expect her to try to cook alot of  stuff. Let me know 
what is needed as far as food.
?Oh, Allison's tests also were better. The urinary reflux  that was seen 6 
months ago appears to have corrected itself. No surgery needed,  however they 
are still concerned about why she has had the frequent urinary  tract 
infections. Anyway she too is doing much better. Let me hear ffrom both of  
you.

A store owner was tacking a sign above his door
that read "Puppies for Sale."

The signs have a way of attracting children.
Soon a little boy appeared at the sign and asked, "How much are you gonna
sell
those puppies for?".

The store owner replied, "Anywhere from $30-$50."
The little boy reached into his pocket and pulled out some change.
"I have $2.37, can I look at them?"

The store owner smiled and whistled.* Out of the kennel came his dog
named Lady, running down the aisle of his store followed by five little
puppies.* One puppy was lagging considerably behind.

Immediately the little boy singled out the lagging, limping puppy.* He
asked "What's wrong with that little dog?"

The man explained that when the puppy was born the vet said that
this puppy had a bad hip socket and would limp for the rest of his life.

The little boy got really excited and said, "That's the puppy I want to
buy!"

The man replied "No, you don't want to buy that little dog. If you
really want him, I'll give him to you." The little boy got upset. He
looked straight into the man's eyes and said "I don't want you to give him
to
me.
He is worth every bit as much as the other dogs and I'll pay the full
price.* In fact I will give you $2.37 now and 50 cents every month until I
have him paid for."

The man countered, "You really don't want to buy this puppy son.
He is never gonna be able to run, jump and play like other puppies."
The little boy reached down and rolled up his pant leg to reveal a
badly twisted, crippled left leg supported by a big metal brace.* He
looked up at the man and said, "Well, I don't run so well myself and the
little puppy will need someone who understands."

The man was now biting his bottom lip.* Tears welled up in his
eyes....He smiled and said, "Son, I hope and pray that each and every one
of

these puppies will have an owner such as you."

IN LIFE, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO YOU ARE, BUT WHETHER SOMEONE
APPRECIATES YOU FOR WHAT YOU ARE, ACCEPTS YOU AND LOVES YOU
UNCONDITIONALLY.




A REAL FRIEND IS ONE WHO WALKS IN WHEN THE REST OF THE WORLD WALKS AWAY.

SEND THIS TO ALL THE PEOPLE IN YOUR LIFE YOU CONSIDER TO BE SPECIAL.

ALL I NEED TO KNOW I LEARNED FROM THE EASTER BUNNY

...Don't put all your eggs in one basket
...Walk softly and carry a big carrot
...Everyone needs a friend who is all ears
...There's no such thing as too much candy
...All work and no play can make you a basket case
...A cute little tail attracts a lot of attention
...Everyone is entitled to a bad hare day
...Let happy thoughts multiply like rabbits
...Some body parts should be floppy
...Keep your paws off other people's jelly beans
...Good things come in small sugarcoated packages
...The grass is always greener in someone else's basket
...An Easter bonnet can tame even the wildest hare
...To show your true colors you have to come out of your shell
...The best things in life are still sweet and gooey

sandwiches or sliced brisket with "fixin's"? That will determine what kind
of "fixin's" we need..Let me know..

CHOOSING A NEW  BATHING SUIT

Apparently a true e-mail a woman wrote to  her friend after shopping for
a bathing suit.

I have just been through the annual pilgrimage of torture and
humiliation known as buying a bathing suit.  When I  was a child in the
1950's, the bathing suit for a woman with a  mature figure was designed
for a woman with a mature, figure  - boned, trussed and reinforced, not
so much sewn as engineered. They were built to hold back and uplift and
they did a good job.

Today's stretch fabrics are designed for the pre-pubescent  girl with a
figure carved from a potato chip.  The mature  woman has a choice - she
can either front up at the  maternity department and try on a floral
suit with a skirt, coming away looking like a hippopotamus who escaped
from Disney's Fantasia - or she can wander around every run-of-the-mill
department store trying to make a sensible choice from what  amounts to
a designer range of fluorescent rubber bands.

What choice did I have?  I wandered around, made my  sensible choice and
entered the chamber of horrors known as the  fitting room.  The first
thing I noticed was the extraordinary  tensile strength of the stretch
material.

The  Lycra used in bathing costumes was developed, I believe, by NASA to
launch small rockets from a slingshot, which give the added bonus that
if you manage to actually lever yourself into one, you are protected
from shark attacks.  The reason for this is  that any shark taking a
swipe at your passing midriff would  immediately suffer whiplash.

I fought my way into the  bathing suit, but as I twanged the shoulder
strap in place, I  gasped in horror - my bosom had disappeared!
Eventually, I found one bosom cowering under my left armpit.  It took a
while to  find the other.

At last I located it  flattened beside my seventh rib.  The problem is
that   modern bathing suits have no bra cups.  The mature woman is meant
to wear her bosom spread across her chest like a speed  hump.

I realigned my speed hump and lurched toward the  mirror to take a full
view assessment.  The bathing suit fit  all right, but unfortunately, it
only fit those bits of me  willing to stay inside it.  The rest of me
oozed out rebelliously from top, bottom, and sides.  I looked like a
lump of  play dough wearing undersized cling wrap.

As I tried to work out where all those extra bits had come from, the
pre-pubescent sales girl popped head through the curtains, "Oh There you
are!" she said, admiring the bathing suit...I replied that I wasn't so
sure and asked what else she had to show me.

I tried on a cream crinkled one that made me look like a lump  of
masking tape, and a floral two piece which gave the appearance  of an
oversized napkin in a serviette ring.  I struggled into  a pair of
leopard skin bathers with ragged frill and came  out looking like
Tarzan's Jane pregnant with triplets and having a  rough day.

I tried on a black number with a midriff  and looked like a jellyfish in
mourning.  I tried on a bright  pink pair with such a high cut leg I
thought I would have to wax my  eyebrows to wear them.

Finally, I found a suit that  fit...a two piece affair with shorts style
bottom and a loose  blouse-type top.  It was cheap, comfortable, and
bulge  friendly, so I bought it.

When I got home, I read the  label which said "Material may become

transparent in water." I'm  determined to wear it anyway...I'll just
have to stay out of  the water!

    A small boy walks into his mother's room and catches her topless.
     "Mummy, Mummy, what are those?" he says pointing to her breasts. "Well,
son,"she says, These are balloons, and when you die, they inflate and float
    you up to heaven," Incredibly, he appears to believe this explanation
and
goes
    off quite satisfied.
    Two days later while his mother is making tea, he rushes into the
kitchen.
    "Mummy, mummy, Aunt Eliza is dying!" "What do you mean?" says his
    mother."Well she's out in the garden shed, lying on the floor with both
of
    her balloons out. Dad's trying to blow themup for her and she keeps
yelling,
"God, I'm coming! God, I'm coming!"

This foot-and-mouth virus that is sweeping throughout Europe is enough to 
make even the greatest carnivore turn into a strict vegetarian. I seriously 
doubt that it would actually come to that, but if it did, I could probably 
swing it... maybe. However, I can't vouch for Sunny and Edgar. Recently, 
JokeMistress and me ordered take out from this cool vegetarian place by us. 
We had some Soy Bean Burger left over, so I placed it down for them eat. I 
wasn't very surprised when they didn't maul it, but what I didn't expect was 
how insulted they were by my well-intended gesture. They looked at me as if 
to say, "Are you kidding us?" I told them I was and promised never to do it 
again.

DRINKING BUDDIES

A couple of drinking buddies who are airplane mechanics are in a hangar at 
JFK New York. It's fogged in and they have nothing to do. 

One of them says to the other, "Man, have you got anything to drink?" 

The other one says, "Nah, but I hear you can drink jet fuel, and it will 
kinda give you a buzz." 
So they do drink it, get smashed and have a great time, like only drinking 
buddies can. 

The following morning, one of the men wakes up and he just knows his head 
will explode if he gets up, but it doesn't. He gets up and feels good. In 
fact, he feels great! No hangover! 

The phone rings. It's his buddy. The buddy says, "Hey, how do you feel?" 

"Great", he said! "Just great"! The buddy says, "Yeah, I feel great too, and 
no hangover. That jet fuel stuff is great. We should do this more often! 

"Yeah, we could, but there's just one thing . . . " 

"What's that?" 

"Did you fart yet?" 

"No . . . " 

"Well, DON'T, 'cause I'm in Phoenix."

I agree, Sunday was really enjoyable. It was so nice to have all the moms
that are still with us around and to be able to serve them for once.
Celebrating Mom's birthday on Saturday should be great. Just let me know
what to bring and I'll be there.
In regards to Mom...yes, she seems quite concerned about us putting her into
a nursing home if she lets on that she forgets things; she was almost in
tears when she talked about it, remember Doris? Anyway, we need to attempt
to assure her that won't happen as long as she continues to take her tests
and medicines as she needs to.
I agree with Bill that we might want to consider a checking account which
requires 2 signatures over a certain amount (say $500 or $1000..whatever we
agree is a "safe" amount)...Doris would be the most likely candidate, I
feel, since she is there and much more aware of Mom's daily needs or
desires. She must understand that by doing this, we would not "take control"
of her money...just help her "remember" payment of large purchases. She
still needs to be able to buy what she wants or needs...Our concern is
someone "conning" her out of money without her realization of it.Requiring 2
signatures on checks over a certain dollar amount would help, I feel.
Anyway, you'all think about it. Other suggestions? Doris, you see the
day-to-day activities, so you are probably best to bring to Dan and my
attention matters that appear to be a problem for Mom....and between the 3
of us, surely we can work out a solution that helps Mom and still lets her
maintain her dignity and respect.
OK>>>>see you'all on the 3rd...let me know what things I need to
bring..Wanna get a gift? I was thinking that a Bunn coffee maker would be so
nice for her...quick coffee, and ready whenever she wants it...plus maybe it
won't spill all over the counter, etc. when poured..Think about it, if
you'all want to go in on it together...If not for her birthday..maybe
Christmas? ..Just a thought.

Bettye

A husband and wife  were having dinner at a very fine 
restaurant when this absolutely stunning  young woman came over to 
their table, gave the husband a big open-mouthed  kiss, said she'd see 
him later, and walked away. The wife glared at her  husband and said, 
"Who 
the hell ?was ?that?" 
"Oh," replied  the husband, "she's my mistress." 
"Well, that's the last straw," said the  wife. 
"I've had enough, and I want a divorce!" 
"I can understand that,"  replied her husband, "but 
remember, if we get a divorce it will mean no more  shopping 
trips to Paris, no more wintering in Barbados, no more summers in  
Tuscany, no more Infiniti or Lexus in the garage, and no more yacht  
club. But the decision is yours." 
Just then, a mutual friend entered the  restaurant with a 
gorgeous babe on his ?arm. 
"Who's that woman with  Jim?" asked the wife. 
"That's his mistress," said her husband. 
"Ours is  prettier," she replied.

Subject: Henry Ford and God




Henry Ford dies and goes to heaven. At the Gates, St. Peter greets Ford and
tells him, "Well, you've been such a good guy, and your
invention...the assembly line for the automobile...changed the world. As a
reward, you can hang out with anyone in Heaven you want."

Ford thinks about it, and says, - "I want to hang out with God Himself."

So the befuddled St. Peter takes Ford to the Throne Room, and introduces him
to God. Ford then asks God, - "When you invented Woman, what were you
thinking?"

God asks, "What do you mean?"
"Well," says Ford, "You have some major design flaws in your invention:
1. There's too much front end protrusion.
2. It chatters way too much at high speeds.
3. Maintenance is extremely high.
4. It constantly needs repainting and refinishing.
5. Every 28 days it leaks fluid and is rendered out of service.
6. The rear end wobbles too much.
7. The intake is placed too close to the exhaust.
8. The headlights are usually too small.
9. Fuel consumption is outrageous.

"Hummmm," replies God, "hold on a minute." God goes over to the
Celestial Supercomputer, types in a few keystrokes, and waits for the
results. In no time the computer prints out a report, and God reads it.
God then turns to Ford, and says, "It may be that my invention is
flawed, but according to these statistics, more men are riding my
invention than yours.

A single man wanted someone to help him with the household
chores, so he decided to get a pet to help out. He went to
the local pet shop and asked the owner for advice on a
suitable animal. The owner suggested a dog, but the man said,
"Nah, dogs can't do dishes." The owner then suggested a cat,
but the man said, "Nah, cats can't do the ironing."

Finally the owner suggests a centipede, "This is the perfect
pet for you. It can do anything!" "OK," the man thought,
"I'll give it a try," so he bought it and took it home. Once
home he told the centipede to wash the dishes. The centipede
looks over and there are piles and piles of dirty dishes that
look to be a month old. Five minutes later, all the pots are
washed, dried, and put away. "Great," thought the man.

Now he told the centipede to do the dusting and vacuuming.
Fifteen minutes later the house is spotless. Wow, thought the
man, so he decided to try another idea. "Go down to the
corner and get me the evening paper," he told the centipede,
and off it went.

Fifteen minutes later, the centipede hadn't returned. 30
minutes later and still no centipede. Forty-five minutes and
the man was sick of waiting, so he got up and went out to
look for the centipede.

As he opened the front door, there on the step was the
centipede. "Hey, whatcha' doing there? I sent you out for the
paper 45 minutes ago and now I find you out here without the
paper! What gives?"

"Hold on a minute!" said the centipede, "I'm still putting on
my boots!"

think Mom is planning on fixing chicken noodle soup' Buddy saw Mom  today,

  Really Bad Day

  There was this little guy sitting inside a bar, just looking at his
  drink. He didn't move for a half an hour.

  Then, this big trouble-making truck driver stepped up right next to him,
  took the drink from the guy, and just drank it all down.

  The poor man started crying.

  The truck driver said, "Come on man, I was just joking. Here, I'll buy
  you another drink. I just can't stand to see a man crying."

  "No, it's not that." the man said. "Today is the worst day of my life.
  First, I overslept and was late for an important meeting. My boss became
  outraged and then fired me.

  "When I left the building to go to my car, I found that it was stolen.
  The police said they could do nothing. I then got a cab to return home,
  and after I paid the cab driver and the cab had gone, I found that I left
  my wallet in the cab.

  "I got home only to find my wife was in bed with the gardener. I left
  home depressed and came to this bar. And now, when I was thinking about
  putting an end to my life...

  "... YOU show up and drink the poison."

NINE MONTHS LATER 

Jack decided to go skiing with his buddy, Bob. They  loaded up Jack's
mini van and headed north. After driving for a few hours, they got caught in a
terrible blizzard. They pulled into a nearby farm and asked the
attractive lady who answered the door if they could spend the night. 

"I realize it's terrible weather out there and I have this huge house all
to myself, but I'm recently "widowed," she explained. "I'm afraid the
neighbors will talk if I let you stay in my house." 

"Don't worry," Jack said. "We'll, be happy to sleep in the barn. And if
the weather breaks, we'll be gone at first light" 

The lady agreed, and the two men found their way to the barn and settled
in for the night.  Come morning, the weather had cleared, and they got on
their way. They enjoyed a great weekend of skiing. 

About nine months later, Jack got an unexpected letter from an attorney.
It took him a few minutes to figure it out, but he finally determined that
it was from the attorney of that attractive widow he had met on the ski 
weekend.  He dropped in on his friend Bob and asked, "Bob, do you
remember that good-looking widow from the farm we stayed at on our ski 
holiday up 
north?" 

"Yes, I do. 

"Did you happen to get up in the middle of the night, go up to the house
and pay her a visit?" 

"Yes," Bob said, a little embarrassed about being found out. "I have to 
admit that I did." 

"And did you happen to use my name instead of telling her your name?" 

Bob's face turned red and he said, "Yeah, sorry, buddy.  I'm afraid I
did. Why do you ask?" 

"She just died and left me everything." 

(And you thought the ending would be different, didn't you?)

Sunday really was good. We had a really good time also. I think Mom enjoyed
it also. Getting together for Mom's birthday sounds great to me Only have
one suggestion. Tell Mom that we are taking her out for her birthday or else
she will try to cook everthing. Then we can all show up with the food.
I don't know what to say about how she would feel about losing control of
her checking account. Some days she seems really concerned about what she
has in the bank and other times she handles things well. She did give Buddy
a signed blank check to go pay for fertilizer on a Sat. and then when he
went to pay for it on Mom. evening she had already gone in and paid for it
herself that morning. She had forgotten she had told him to do it.She still
thinks she will be put in a nursing home if she forgets things. She told us
again Sunday that they put Aunt Minnie in a nursing home because she forgot
the stove on. Though i'm sure it was more to it than that. I'm open to
suggestions.

A young Marine and his commanding officer board a train headed through the
mountains of Switzerland. They can find no place to sit except for two
seats right across the aisle from a young woman and her grandmother.

After a while, it is obvious that the young woman and the young soldier
are interested in each other because they are giving each other "looks."

Soon, the train passes into a tunnel and it is pitch black. There is a
sound of the smack of a kiss, followed by the sound of the smack of a
slap. When the train emerges from the tunnel, the four sit there without
saying a word.

The grandmother is thinking to herself: "It was very brash for that young
soldier to kiss my granddaughter, but I'm glad she slapped him."

The commanding officer is setting there thinking: "I didn't know the young
Marine was brave enough to kiss the girl, but I sure wish she hadn't
missed him when she slapped and hit me!"

The young woman was sitting and thinking: "I'm glad the soldier kissed me,
but I wish my grandmother had not slapped him!"

The young Marine sat there with a satisfied smile on his face, thinking to
himself: "Life is good. When does a fellow have the chance to kiss a
beautiful girl and slap his commanding officer, all at the same time?"
