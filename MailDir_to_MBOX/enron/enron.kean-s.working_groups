Msg. from Rick Shapiro

I know how eagerly everyone is awaiting the formation of the Resource 
Allocation Working group*.  Below is a brief description of the group's 
purpose and initial steps we will be taking.  I want to thank everyone in 
advance for what I know will be a successful effort.

What this group is about:       Identifying best practices within Public 
Affairs for prioritization of efforts and allocation of resources and 
documenting the best practices for implementation as soon as possible 
throughout Public Affairs.

How we're going to do it:  Quickly and efficiently.

Why we're doing this:  Because we have finite human and financial 
resources.... because we have an obligation to direct those finite resources 
to their highest and best use.
  
When we're going to start this process:  Initial meeting in Houston, January 
7, 2000 from 8:00am - 11:00am (call in participation is perfectly acceptable).

What's required for initial meeting:  A one page or less description of how 
your group prioritizes its efforts; how both human and financial resources 
are allocated, and how all of this fits within your budgeting process (should 
be distributed to all group members two (2) days prior to meeting).

Finally:  I am attaching material that my group has used over the last year 
to implement a resource allocation/issue priortization process.  I will 
provide a more detailed explanation at the initial meeting.  Please feel free 
to call me if you have any questions before then.

*  You've either been nominated or selected, or volunteered for this working 
group.  Congratulations.

Upon further reflection after the recent staff meeting, I have made the 
determination that any and allengagements of outside resources, e.g., outside 
counsel & consultants, public relations firms, etc... must be approved 
through the Resource Commitment Review (RCR) process.  Accordingly, the $2500 
trigger that had been in place is no longer.  To ensure that the process 
works in a more timely manner, I am creating weekly RCR meetings (Harry, Jim 
& myself) at which all pending RCR's will be acted on.  I will deal with 
emergency RCR's as they may arise between the weekly meetings.

Bottom line, the RCR process is of enormous value to the group as it helps to 
document that we are properly focusing the company's resources in the places 
where it is of most value.  I firmly believe that whatever minor 
inconveniences this change will entail, they are minor in relationship to 
ensuring the success and credibility of the RCR process.

My apologies for not kicking things off earlier, but the regulator here has 
conspired to make the last few weeks a bit mad.  Consequently, it's taken me 
a while to set down some thoughts on how we might get the best out of the 
market structure group.  Attached below is an initial stab at some "terms of 
reference" to describe the scope and objectives of the group.  I thought this 
might help us to come to a common understanding of what we are trying to 
achieve.   I'm conscious that the one area that is a bit lacking is 
"Deliverables", ie, what will we come up with as the output from this 
process?  This needn't be a formal "report" - indeed I suspect that 
establishing a regular process of information exchange and discussion is 
likely to provide more durable benefits.

I'd very much welcome your views on our scope and objective over the next few 
days.  I'd also welcome a brief update on which issues you are all working as 
a way introducing our interest in the topic of market structure.  This should 
also help to kick-start the process of exchanging ideas.  My own contribution 
is below.

I've also attached a couple of documents that I think may be useful.  One I 
prepared for the Federal Energy Commission in Russia as a statement of "What 
is a foreign investor looking for in a liberalised market?"  It was written 
for an audience for whom a competitive electricity market is an alien 
concept.  For example, we were attempting to change the FEC's mindset that 
power marketers were an unnecessary layer of costs - because their "tariff" 
added to other participants tariffs would increase prices.  As a result it is 
very high level and conceptual.  However, it has some value as a basic 
delineation of where the key market structure issues lie.  The other 
documents relate to the proposals for New Trading Arrangements in England and 
Wales  (further information on these reforms can be obtained from the 
regulator's website at http://www.ofgas.gov.uk/).  While far from perfect, 
these reforms provide a good example of wholesale trading arrangement reform 
for use elsewhere (for good or bad).

I'll be on vacation next week, but on my return I'd like to set up a video 
conference/conference call to discuss how we can take things further.  Any 
suggestions for agenda items for that would be most welcome.

Regards

Paul



------------------------------------------

UK Electricity

The regulators - Ofgem and the DTI are is undertaking a massive programme of 
reforming the electricity market in England and Wales.  These reforms have 
followed the UK government's moratorium on new gas plant in late 1997 and are 
designed to remove perceived "distortions" in the market.  The reforms centre 
on:

New Electricity Trading Arrangements (NETA) to replace the Pool from October 
this year.  We have had a significant input into the this process.  While 
generally supportive of the proposals, we have opposed several undue 
restrictions on managing risk.
Plant divestment by major mid-merit generators to increase competition in the 
price-setting part of the market.  We were instrumental in this process, 
following our analysis late in 1997 of the costs of generator market power to 
electricity consumers.  Divestment has since significantly increased the 
liquidity and competition in the wholesale market.  Despite this the 
regulator is seeking greater powers to intervene in the wholesale market to 
prevent market "manipulation".  We think this represents an unacceptable 
extension of regulatory power and are therefore likely to oppose the 
regulator at the Competition Commission enquiry into this.
New transmission access and pricing arrangements.  While these reforms may 
have limited merit, in general we think they're a waste of time and our 
existing asset positions are significantly exposed.  The regulator has just 
started consulting on this and this is one area that I suspect your 
experiences in the US and elsewhere might be useful to me.

Mike. 

This is one of the policy issues we need to reconcile, not only internally in 
our region but also because of contradictory policy positions in other 
regions as well. This is one of the Agenda Items in our regulatory plan for 
2000. We will establish a working group to look at the issue and the final 
outcome will be a position statement of what Enron stands for.  We know that 
our "flag themes" are competition and customer choices, but  we need to be 
more concrete on situations that require a "close system" as a pre-condition 
for infrastructure development, and then a position of a migration approach 
or milestones to provide greater access and customer choice.

The context is that there are substantial differences in the stage of market, 
regulatory, and infrastructure development in the regions and specific areas 
within the regions ; from "greenfield distribution development opportunity" 
in the southern states of Brazil, to a more mature situation in Argentina and 
elsewhere.  We need to explore these differences and state what are we 
willing to defend. 

The answer "Brazil distribution system is close because it  is in the 
Constitution or in the concessions contracts" is not very uplifting. The 
position "All distribution companies have to allow for full access of all 
customers to their selected supplier" does not address the practical issue of 
greenfield development.   We need to develop a different answer. 

WE SHOULD NOT ASK OTHERS TO WORK UNDER RULES THAT WE WOULD NOT AGREE TO WORK 
UNDER!!!

 WE SHOULD MEAN WHAT WE SAY AND ACT AS WE SAY!!!
 

In order to get an answer that would be accepted not only in our region but 
also globally; we need to explore this issue through a task force.  The first 
task will be to draft a recommendation and later to have it reviewed by 
Executive Management.

The key people in our region for this are:

Business Units heads:  Mike Guerriero, Rick Waddell/Orlando Pupin  (George 
Wasaff and Pete Wielder do you want to get involved now?)

Gas Regulation:  Mike Smith, Guillermo Canovas

Outside the Region:  Jane Wilson, (I am soliciting other names to get a input 
of other experiences in the USA. I will have them later on). We need to 
plan     for their time commitment.

Mike Guerriero has a window of opportunity in Argentina because he is a new 
comer. In order to be productive and do it on a fast time table I would like 
you to organize the meetings and the inputs. Let's set a tentative target to 
get the draft out at the end of January . You need to consult with the other 
people, provide us with a propose plan  and make sure we set aside the time 
and get the time commitment.

Thanks

Jose

Subject: Full Unbundling of Distribution Companies in Argentina

Guys

We should have a meeting to discuss the above topic. Mike Guerriero is 
proposing that the distribution companies in Argentina should fully unbundle, 
which would include that they get rid of the buying and selling of gas and 
that function would basically be borne by marketers. There are some other 
topics, but this is the one that needs to be discussed internally. 

I propose we have a meeting at 8am Houston time on Wednesday, December 15th  
which is an hour before the risk committee meetings starts. If you cannot be 
there, I would appreciate you sending a representative for you. This topic 
needs to be decided quickly so that a package can be put together for the 
higher end of the government ready to go at the first of the year.

Gabby, could you get a call in number for everyone and distribute to everyone?

thanks

mike

I initiated the group earlier this year, with the attached terms of 
reference.  To kick the process off, I included some key documents on market 
structure issues we have been working on in England and Wales.  
Unfortunately, I got no response to my suggestions for the groups working 
methods nor any additional contributions on market structure issues from 
other group members.  As a result, although the group has not been 
terminated, I cannot really claim that it functioned as a group either.

I saw the deliverable from the group as exchanging information and ideas to 
use in our individual efforts.  I did not see the group as having concrete 
deliverables (eg, a global Enron position on X which would be unlikely to fit 
the unique circumstances of each of the markets that we find ourselves 
operating in).  The question is whether this information exchange needs to be 
achieved through a formal group with limited membership or through extension 
of our internal Govt Affairs network.  A valuable way in which this has been 
achieved is through group "get togethers" such as the conference, our UK 
offsite which some US colleagues attended and the Thailand effort - all of 
which provide a good way to meet our colleagues and establish contacts.  A 
formal group is always likely to suffer somewhat from conflicting, immediate 
priorities.   The challenge is to ensure that on those occasions where such 
exchange makes a real difference to the outcome of our regulatory efforts 
that we leverage our internal contacts and international experience 
appropriately.  I suspect that much of this work already gets done 
informally, eg, recent exchange of information notes on California, help from 
London on performance standards to support our Indian efforts etc.

Please provide me an update on the progress of the working group you have led 
this year.  There are several things I would like you to cover in this regard.

Did the working group function through the year or was it terminated (I

understand those reasons).

What did the group accomplish?

Would you recommend continuing it?   Any changes?

Are there other topics we should consider for working groups in the future?  
Any changes to the working group process itself?

Please provide input on the individuals you worked with.  You should be able 
to do this through the PEP system.  If you cannot, please provide the

Subject: Argentina Retail Unbundling

I've been thinking about Michael Guerreiro's desire to push retail 
unbundling, particularly for gas, in Argentina.  As we know, Michael had 
experience in the Atlanta area on retail unbundling prior to joining Enron; 
therefore, he knows what he is after and asserts (correctly) that the 
attainment of retail unbndling is critical for his success as new head of the 
Argentina trading office -- without it, Enron cannot be successful.   It is 
important for us to accommodate Michael's sense of urgency; however, to 
blindly act, make filings and lobby without having thought through the issues 
would not be in Enron's best interest.  We have experience in regulatory in 
Argentina and know that action without forethought is not a wise course of 
action.

As an initial thought, I would suggest that the US retail unbundling 
experience is not 100% transferrable to Argentina and that Enron should 
carefully construct a phased approach that is adapted to the Argentina 
political and regulatory realities.  To do this, I suggest the following:

Schedule 1-2 days in January in Houston for a strategy session.  I suggest 
Houston over Buenos Aires, only because of the inclusion of so many of the 
people who are not Southern Cone related.  We could try for Southern Cone if 
that is your preference, but I am concerned about the likelihood of getting 
all the below-named individuals to travel internationally.

 A. The first day would be the construction of the regulatory overview of 
retail unbundling, the final product being a matrix of what the process 
entails and what the major issues are and generally how these issues are 
being managed in the United States.  I would involve the following people in 
this session:

  Mike Smith
  Guillermo Canovas
  Jose Bestard
  Jane Wilson
  Robert Neustaedter
  Harry Kingerski
  Pat Keene
  Michael Guerreiro?
  Roberto Pensotti?

Pat Keene and Robert Neustaedter to take the lead on constructing a 
presentation.  Harry is a Sr. Director for Steve Kean in detailed rates and 
tariffs issues.  I hired him as my director at EES.  He is a regulatory whiz, 
although his emphasis is power.  I also hired Pat Keene who is a regulatory 
gas distribution guru from New Mexico.  He now works for Harry in Steve 
Kean's group.  [Jose, to the end of the construction of the working group, 
perhaps Pat Keene could be permanent with Harry brought in on a consultative 
basis periodically.]

 B. Day two would be a sharing of experience in Georgia (Atlanta), New York, 
and the UK, followed by the construction of actual Argentine strategy with a 
timeline.  The point here would be to learn how the facts of the specific 
fact situation in Georgia, New York, UK and FERC affected the outcomes of the 
general retail unbundling issues.  This will make it easier to anticipate 
what will happen in Argentina.  The guests would be:

  Kathleen Magruder -- Atlanta
  Lisa Polk -- EES, worked on the details in Atlanta
  Steve Montovano -- Brooklyn Union
  Joe Hartsoe -- Washington FERC VP 
  Someone (Philip Davies or Doug Wood -- cannot remember which is gas?) from 
Mark Schroeder's group.
  The attendees on Day One

This is a tall order for one day; perhaps we could prepare well in advance on 
Day One to cut time and start Day Two in the afternoon of Day One?  

[Jose, the UK person should be on the working group.  Perhaps you should 
think about two working groups, one  Argentina, one Brazil, with alternates 
for gas and electric?]

My suggestion is that Houston Regulatory would pull together this strategy 
session for Argentina and assist with drafting the actual initial filings or 
comments on an input basis.  The Southern Cone group would then take over to 
get it done, you consulting the working group on an ongoing basis as things 
develop.  

I'm going to India for a week Monday.  However, I download on a regular 
basis; but, because of time differences, my response will be a day later than

Rick:  Per your request, please find the one page description of how the 
Washington D.C. office prioritizes both human and financial resources while 
fitting within the Enron budget process.   I have attached our 1999 
activities report which illustrates the process described below.  

Congress operates in a two year cycle while the Administration operates in a 
four or eight year cycle.  Thus, it is necessary for our prioritization to 
focus on the long term.  Within the context of the Congressional and 
Administration's Calendars, our office determines and communicates doable 
priorities based upon the environment in which we operate.  In addition, we 
actively work behind the scenes and commit resources to affect and change 
this environment.

 On an annual basis, we communicate federal legislative and global 
opportunities which we believe affect our operations via briefings to Steve 
Kean, who along with our assistance, submits our proposed goals to the Enron 
Management Committee,  Global CEO's , individual operating company heads and 
heads of key divisions.  Many dialogues and briefings occur resulting in goal 
adjustments and additions.  During this dialogue, we advise on possible new 
corporate strategies based upon political realities and communicate necessary 
resources required in order to achieve the legislative successes.  

Once this vetting process is complete (December-January timeframe), and the 
Management Committee prioritizes the federal Corporate goals, we submit our 
budget and assure this budget directly correlates to the necessary resources 
(both human and financial) detailed and allocated to meet these priorities.  
(Note:  the budget process usually occurs in the August-October timeframe).  
On the financial side, we keep current as to the rates and the expertise 
available on the market, as well as, track potential conflicts of interest.   
It's our job to know our environment and to lay out strategy.  On an annual 
basis, we adjust our resources which can include dropping some issues, 
reassigning personnel, hiring or letting go necessary outside counsel, etc.  

We remain mindful that in order to achieve legislative success, it is 
necessary to follow long-term planning so as to allow for us to build 
credibility, keep important political relationships viable and, ultimately, 
place us in the best possible political position to achieve success. 

Our budget does its best to recognize that the Congressional process can be 
unpredictable and that Congress reacts to fast occurring events and public 
reaction.   It is rare when we have not foreseen some form of a potential 
issue; thus, we always operate within budget.  An example of a contingency 
issue would be India setting off a nuclear device, a possibility we had 
accounted for yet could not possibly exactly predict nor could we predict the 
fall-out and precise Corporate impact.  However,we were still able to budget 
for possible permutations for such an occurrence and make adjustments as 
needed in order to meet our goals and stay within our budget.  Based upon the 
experience of the people in our office, we have been very successful in 
anticipating these type of occurrences.

Our report details our 1999 results and projects Enron priorities for 2000 
although neither the President's State of the Union address which outlines 
the Executive Branch's legislative agenda for 2000 nor the Republican 
Congressional response and 2000 Congressional legislative agenda has as of 
yet been delivered nor finalized.

At our 2nd meeting on Feb 8, we reviewed the purpose of each subgroup and 
heard progress updates from each of the groups.  We scheduled our 3rd meeting 
for Friday, February 25, from 9:30 am to 11:30 am  CST.   At this meeting, we 
will

1) hear from the "Descriptive Model" subgroup (Roy, Mark, Amr, Rob) about the 
ways Public Affairs supports EES in the US and Europe, what works well, what 
could improve, and practices that could be transferred between regions,

2) hear from the "Resources & Information" subgroup (Peggy, Rita, Jim) about 
who are the right contacts in each organization, how we can depict these and 
communicate them, and how information can be made accessible (intranet, 
Information Resources WG, etc.),

3) hear from the "Product Development" subgroup (John, Roy, Peggy, Steve) 
about some ideas for adding to EES' commercial offerings,

4) hear from the "Client Needs" subgroup (Harry, Nancy Mike) about an 
approach for eliciting input from EES on their needs from Public Affairs, and 
progress to date, and 

5) hear from the newly formed "Interaction" subgroup (Amr, Harry, Steve) 
about how EES' presence in world markets could affect Enron valuations of 
other business opportunities.

If any of the groups have materials to distribute, please coordinate with me 
and we will make sure it is distributed prior to the meeting.
We will contact you later with call-in numbers for the conference.  Thank you.

Steve: We had an outstanding kidk off meeting in Houston and then two 
additional meetings of declining participation. We have copied the Enron WTO 
Working Group on various e-mails but other than Geneen Migden and of course 
Rick Shapiro in his supervisory role have had no input except from Chris and 
Steve. Steve has been communicating directly with EBS on the growing 
e-commerce and audio visual aspects of the WTO services negotiation launch 
which we are anticipating in the spring. We now have concerns in the 
financial services area (trading) which  may be emerging. I copied our 
Washington group this morning on a confidential ISAC 13 document I received 
yesterday which Bob Fisher recommended that we examine closely regarding 
financial services.

I think a WTO task force continues to have merit but perhaps should be 
staffed by people from EBS, Enron's financial services people, perhaps a Tom 
Briggs and chaired by Linda if you see the growing aspects of our work on WTO 
services. We also need the help of our trade professional Bob Fisher.

Terry: I am pleased that you will serve and appreciate your question asking 
for objectives and goals.  The goal is to get information defining what each 
Enron group wants in energy services liberalization. Second is to have them 
define by country the impediments to our businesses that we want addressed in 
a WTO energy services negotiation and third, what groups or companies in 
various regions of the globe can we enlist to lobby their government in 
support of an energy services agenda.

Ideally I would like to have input by January 15, 2000. Perhaps we can all 
meet in Houston about that time to exchange written information, discuss it 
and plan a strategy for 2000.

I will attach the questionaire that Bob Fisher of the Hills group prepared 
from the Rachel Thompson paper that was distributed to Energy Services 
Coalition members in November and asked that they complete it by the middle 
part of December which is today. So far we have had very little response.  
The WTO is to meet in Geneva this week to decide a schedule to consider 
"services" starting this year. Despite the fact that Seattle did not launch a 
formal round of negotiations, the Uruguay Round concluded seven years ago 
mandated that the WTO begin negotiations on agrucultural and services 
liberalization in 2000. The next formal meeting of the WTO is January 25 in 
Geneva.

Joe

that they were "volunteered", so your initial communication should include 
that information.

Please keep me posted on your progress (e.g. copy me on e-mail

SK - I printed this & put it in your working group file.  mm

Team--attached are my group's top 10 objectives at the headquarters level and 
at the in-country level for the international PR, marketing communication and 
social responsibility areas.  

How we prioritize

We arrive at these objectives after discussion with heads of the business 
units and senior management, and we focus on goals that support the priority 
business goals of the company and build/protect the reputation of the company 
as a whole.  On a quarterly basis (at least) we review these top objectives 
and ensure that we are staying on target.  Internationally, we are faced with 
numerous issues and crises which must be dealt with and they also take on a 
priority spot when they occur.  

There is an issue with prioritization that we must constantly deal with.  
Some of our clients are PR savvy and wish to use our services, which should 
please us except that sometimes small, low priority and visibility projects 
use too much of our time that should be spent elsewhere.  Conversely, we 
sometimes have important projects that the developer wishes to keep low 
budget and we are not allowed to have the level of input that we should. 

How human and financial resources are allocated

The bulk of our human resources currently are allocated to the regions, and 
the structure is an area in transition since the reorganization and in light 
of several open positions that we have.  We determine in conjunction with the 
business units the proper number and level of staff.  The regional PR head 
determines how his or her junior people are assigned.  At the headquarters 
level, we focus on the activities that benefit the company overall as well as 
top priority countries.  Marketing communication maintains adequate staff to 
meet customer demands, and adds temporary staff during peak periods.  

We all work on the highest priority items for the year, but also tend to 
focus on issues of the moment that are of greatest significance to the 
business unit leaders.   My goal is to keep people focused on the long-term 
objectives for the year and not get caught up in the day to day operations 
without this long term focus.  If there is an area I would like to further 
refine, it is making sure that we are better deploying our human resources on 
what is important.

How financial resources are allocated

We have a PR budget for each operating company, for international 
headquarters, for marketing services and for sustainable development.  At the 
regional level, figures are projected for each country and/or project and 
these are discussed with the various country leaders.  Headquarters budget is 
used for activities that benefit all areas and not one region or country.  

Marketing communication budget is on a bill-back basis (the most difficult to 
predict because it is comprised of costs for developing presentations and 
other marketing/sales tools.  This has been a trait of the former EI and is 
the expectation of developers--if you need it for marketing purposes you do 
it.)  As you will note in my objectives, I would like this department to 
arrange a billing system including their time and fixed costs that allows 
them to be completely self-supporting rather than allocating across business 
units.  This will encourage people to use their services more wisely.

When a new project is being pursued, budgets are approved for all aspects of 
the project including PR, employee communication and social responsibility.  
The social responsibility budgets typically fall short or are non-existent, 
and this is another area that we will be focusing on changing this year.

How this fits with budgeting process

Our allocation of resources is linked directly with our budgeting process.  
There are two exceptions:  

1--pursuing major projects that were not planned at the beginning of the 
year.  Budgets for these new pursuits are approved during the overall project 
approval process, and again, we must work to have greater input in this 
process.

2--costs for resolving major crises such as Cuiaba and Human Rights Watch 
have been significant and were not pre-budgeted.

One of Steve Kean's newly formed Working Groups is for "Rates & Tariffs".  I 
have been asked to lead this group.  For those of you who don't know me, I am 
in Houston in the U.S./Canada Government Affairs group, in a section called 
"Rates/Regulatory Services."  Our working group will have about a dozen or so 
people from various parts of Public Affairs.  You have been 
selected/volunteered to participate in this effort by your group leaders.  

The Working Group members are:
Ray Alvarez
Sergio Assad
Roy Boston
Mike Grimes
Kyran Hanks
Rita Hartfield
Nancy Hetrick
Tom Hoatson
Paul Kaufman
Valeria Lima
Bob Neustaedter

Having this group will give us a great opportunity to identify needs related 
to rate and tariff issues across many business lines and countries, share 
resources, problems and solutions, and generally improve the cohesiveness of 
Steve's organization   One of our first tasks will be to think through and 
concretely specify what we expect to accomplish as a group.   We do not have 
a specific product mandate per se - it will be up to us to figure it out and 
deliver it.   Some possibilities are - identifying rates and tariffs policy 
positions, developing policies where none now exist, but are needed, 
identifying rates and tariff resources available to the group, and acquiring 
resources needed by the group. 

As a preliminary matter, could you e-mail me your group name, position, 
location, phone, e-mail address, and "area of expertise".  We will assemble 
this information in a roster to be distributed to the group.

Early in January, we will be in touch to check availability and schedule an 
initial meeting.  Please be as flexible as possible.  In some cases, we are 
many time zones apart and it will be difficult to match everyone's desired 
time. 

As a second preliminary matter, please give some thought to and e-mail me 
what you think a group like this should accomplish.  Remember, the roster 
above has some of the world's leading authorities on rates and tariffs!   We 
will compile both the complete roster and your ideas on group goals and 
distribute them to everybody prior to our first actual meeting.   At that 
first meeting, we will talk through expectations of us and of each other, and 
the proposed goals.  
Please have your inputs to me by January 7.  I look forward to working with 
you.

I am attaching a preliminary Agenda for the meeting in Houston.  Please send 
me suggested changes.



The intend is for Day 1 Jan 4 to get a business/commercial perspective, the 
business unit leaders will be doing most of the talking, and at the end of 
the day they may elect to leave. Day 2 the commercial support staff will 
continue to work on specific issues and develop the assignement  list. Javier 
Pantoja, and Guillermo Canovas need to stay.

Mike Smith.- Please coordinatte with Jane Wilson about the pre-identified 
issue list  and the regulatory support staff (Southern Cone working Group)  
we want to participate the following day. Please propose a  detailed agenda.

Jane Wilson. I need someone to take notes of the meeting and distribute them 
to the participants.

Robert Neustaedter.- Please make the conference room reservation. I need an 
overhead projector , easel paper and pens, masking tape.

Kelly and Jim Steffes. I need you to participate both days. I do not know 
well enough the other members of the Sothern Cone working group. I do not 
want to add others at this point in time because the obejective of these 
sessions cannot be met with a large group. But review the agenda and suggest 
if I need to add someone else.


Jose

***   CONFIDENTIAL   ***

Did the working group function through the year or was it terminated (I 
recognize there may be good reasons for the latter, but would like to 
understand those reasons).

The original group had 3 meetings between January and March.  The initial 
group consisted of:   
One of our initial directions was to form subgroups with specific tasks, and 
to give people across different parts of the organization a chance to work 
together.  This was organized as: 

Beginning in April, a new subgroup was formed of individuals that had 
individual responsibility for areas where EES might be active 
internationally, and consisted of:  
Rob Hemstock  (Non USA North America)
Amr Ibrahim  (Caribbean)
Luiz Maurer  (South America)
Thane Twiggs  (India)
Mike Grimes (Pacific Rim)
Kyran Hanks (Europe)
Harry Kingerski (USA)

The new subgroup, in effect, replaced the larger group and we have worked 
together through the year as specific, focused needs arose.  I have not 
reconvened the larger group for these two specific reasons:
1) it was clear that, to the extent there were EES international needs, they 
were already being met by Mark Schroeder in Europe and Luiz Maurer in Brazil 
(Scott Porter of EES, in Brazil, made it quite clear he was very happy with 
Luiz.)
2) International EES could not articulate a need from Regulatory Affairs that 
was not being met.  Mark Mueller from EES was very helpful in our initial 
discussions but he said EES was several months away from any viable business 
strategy or regulatory needs.  We were a group "in search of a client". 

Individuals in the (April) subgroup have been in touch with regional 
commercial counterparts and we talk as needed.


What did the group accomplish?


Specific products that were developed and shared with the group:

1) A presentation put together by Gloria Ogenyi on regulatory "Lessons 
Learned" that can have commercial value, and it includes slides used from 
some commercial presentations from EES USA.      
2)  A table put together by Kyran Hanks that shows regulatory attributes by 
country for Europe.    

3) Information sharing.  It was a good way for people across the organization 
and on different continents to get to know one another.  The contacts made 
were valuable.  (Personally, I know it was valuable for me to say in a couple 
of customer presentations, that Enron is the only retailer where I could, 
when faced with a problem, instantly have people on the phone with experience 
from 5 different continents who could help solve the problem.)


Would you recommend continuing it?   Any changes?

No, not the larger working group.  I think it is more effective to organize 
activity around specific needs and bring people together to perform the 
function as needed.  It is hard and was hard to keep everybody's attention if 
there is no specific task.


Are there other topics we should consider for working groups in the future?  
Any changes to the working group process itself?

See above.


Please provide input on the individuals you worked with.  You should be able 
to do this through the PEP system.  If you cannot, please provide the 
feedback by confidential e-mail to me.  Because the PRC is coming up soon, 
please provide the feedback by December 1. 

Kyran Hanks, Mike Dahlke,  and  Amr Ibrahim were especially helpful in this 
process.  I reviewed Amr in the PEP.  We had high attendance and good 
participation from the rest of the team.  Gloria Ogenyi came in and did a 
good job assembling materials.

Terry, etal -

In response to Terry's comments, I have prepared an outline of what I think 
the Regulatory Risk Managment & Assessment Working Group will do.

Key tasks:

1. assist with the completion of the Regulatory Risk Management Process
 - do we have the right information
 - is the process leading to the right conclusions
 - etc.
2. act as chief liason for my group in Houston with the people in Government 
Affairs throughout the world
 - explain the process
 - explain the purpose
 -  help with questions from Government Affairs people thoroughout the world
3. act as Audit "device" for Mitigation plans
 - make sure that the Mitigation plans are followed through on by responsible 
party
4. provide oversight for "risk" assumptions
 - act somewhat as a neutral third-party for reasonableness of basic 
assumptions
 - ensure that the broader political context is captured in the modeling
5. other
 - ???

In terms of work load, I would hope that once the process is up and running, 
the work load will be minimal.  Clearly I would like the Working Group to 
stay informed of Enron's current Regulatory Risk position, but I don't think 
that this will be more than some overviews and responses to questions from my 
direct team.

Given this structure, I would hope that people with political knowledge and 
regulatory expertise are included.  For this effort, I need a team of people 
who understand every region of the world (or at least know how to find out 
about a specific country).

I hope this helps.  

Thanks,

JDS

Subject: Working Groups

We've all been looking carefully at the working group lists trying to decide 
who belongs on what group,  what the focus of the groups will be, and where 
they can bring expertise and make the greatest contribution or perhaps be 
involved in a new area that will add to their knowledge and experience. Since 
Steve wants to finalize the groups close of business Friday,  it would be 
great if each of you could put out a brief description of the working group 
or Maureen could put out a composite that includes answers to these questions:
What will be the primary focus of the group? What types of issues will be 
dealt with?  What type (skills, experience, perspective) will you be looking 
for? For example, Joe Hillings has a huge 41 company association working on 
the WTO/Energy Services negotiations that draws and involves people across 
Enron.  Joe- what will be the focus of this new group and what incremental 
value do you see it adding. Is there one special area that isn't being 
addressed? Or are you formalizing the informal group we already have working 
in this area?  Is the plan to sign up for a group and then collectively 
decide what to work on? Quite simply, what's the charter?

Others questions that we can discuss together on Friday include:  Who is the 
customer for the work product? If an area of compensation/performance 
evaluation is based on the success and participation in these groups,  who 
decides if the product is valuable or the group was a success? How do we 
determine the greatest value project? Where is the interface with the 
commercial people? Isn't  the bottom line contribution the ultimate 
determinator of success? How do we seek and involve people outside Houston 
who aren't involved in a topic area, someone like Stella Chan in Korea or a 
member of the India team? People who would benefit from greater exposure both 
for their growth and contribution.

We have a wonderful opportunity with the consolidation of these groups to 
formalize a system that transfers knowledge and experience across Enron. We 
also have tremendous existing work loads, we are some what resource 
constrained so that participation in these groups has to make a high value 
contribution to Enron's commercial challenges.  These are great general 
topics with strong  leaders.  Let's take the next step and zero in on the 
details.

SK - Printed and put in your working group folder.  Also put as "FYI" next 
scheduled meeting.  mm

Follow - up to our first meeting -

We had very good participation.  In the absence of some technical 
difficulties, we would have had 100% participation.  

As our discussion showed, people bring different issues and needs to the 
group.  It seems that this group will function best if we serve as a source 
of information and resources to each other.  Our collective knowledge is 
capable of helping many different individual problems; we just need to figure 
how to get the right information to the people who need it.  Our first task 
should be to sort through this wide ranging topic and start to focus on some 
specific deliverables.

Attached is an updated roster of the team, and a listing of the subgroups and 
some ideas of what the subgroup should consider.  These ideas are not meant 
to restrict but give some additional clarity.  Please note the subgroup 
membership and the designated team leads, and begin your discussions.

Our next meeting will be Friday, February 4, 9:30 am - 11 am Central Standard 
Time.  More details on phone/video conferencing and a full agenda will be 
given later.  At the meeting, each subgroup should share with the larger 
group their thoughts on the directions to be taken by the subgroup.  At that 
time, we can all offer additional comments.



Thank you!

Steve --

On the people who participated in Reg Risk WG:

The key person who took the time to support us was Amr Ibrahim.  He was 
fantastic.  He could do this himself if he didn't have other 
responsibilities.  Needs alot of kudos for his help.  Also, Vinio Flores and 
Alberto Levy.

Welcome to the Enron WTO Working Group.  We hold our first meeting in Houston 
the evening of Thursday, January 13 at dinner (7:00 PM; restaurant, t/b/a) 
during which Bob Fisher of (Carla) Hills and Company and I will brief 
attendees on current developments and strategy of the Energy Services 
Coalition.

The official Enron WTO Working Group meeting will convene in the Enron 
Building, Conference Room 49C1 on Friday, January 14, 2000 at 8:00 AM-Noon.  
Your input on the attached questionnaire* will be used by the Energy Services 
Coalition (ESC) to draft a position paper for official use.  This 
questionnaire, drafted by Bob Fisher, has already been distributed to members 
of the Energy Services Coalition (ESC) and to many of you.

We also need your input on businesses and associations known to you whom you 
might contact.  We would like you to enlist their support for our goals with 
either our government or others who are able to influence the WTO services 
negotiation.  

We plan to use the Enron Conference Call System on Friday to facilitate the 
participation of those unable to be in Houston for the January 14, 2000 
meeting.  The meeting will adjourn before noon.

Kindly advise Lora Sullivan by e-mail (lsulliv@enron.com) if you plan to be 
with us for the Thursday dinner (7:00 PM) and the Friday session (8:00 AM - 
Noon).

Best wishes for a pleasant holiday.

First, I want to thank everyone that presented for their efforts.  I thought 
the presentations were great and highlighted some key issues.

Second, below you will find electronic copies of each of the presentations 
(in case you don't already have).  I will try and get the material out for 
our next meeting before the meeting - sorry about the mix up this time.

You should also find below a memo that highlights the discussion from 
yesterday.  It still appears to me that most people on the Working Group 
recognize the ability to begin to undertake a more rigorous Regulatory Risk 
analysis.  It also appears that this process is not limited to only the US. 

I would really like to hear people's comments.  Please feel free to either 
call me or send an e-mail.

I will be setting up the next meeting very soon.  The goal is to begin to 
define the process, the data necessary, and the reporting.

Thanks for everything.

Steve,

You requested that I put together a Knowledge Management working group.

To tell you the truth, I got the best support from Elizabeth Linnell.  She 
did a splendid job of coordination and had great ideas of implementation.  
She kept the group alive.

Our main obstacle, aside from other responsibilities, is that other groups, 
specially the eKnow team liked the idea so much that they started calling 
everything "knowledge management" or "expert " without a clear idea of all 
the implications.

A positive discovery was that throughout Enron there are a number of efforts 
that are trying achieve a better situation with respect to information, 
communication and knowledge.  Unfortunately many of this groups are not a 
priority within their business units.

We have an operational  pilot webpage with some interesting content.  

We also drafted two documents.  A first draft of a business plan and a theory 
support document with respect to knowledge.

Our last meeting must have been around August and it is my fault that we have 
not met again but it has to do with my workload in Mexico.  I hope to 
continue with this project by establishing a monthly meeting to arrive to the 
full launch of ther program in our area  A.S.A.P or whenever you set the 
deadline (2nd quarter 2001?)

I would recommend  implementation but, perhaps due to Elizabeth's and my 
responsibilities we would need someone else that devotes more time to the 
implementation of this project.

I think it would be important to develop a working group for training within 
our area.  They could develop programs, ask for changes in current programs 
so that they are also focused to what we do.  Promote the assistance of our 
team to different courses, internal and external, etc. 

Please call if I can be of assistance.

Best,

Ricardo

Steve,

After the Napa meeting last December, I headed up a  working group to look at 
coordinating EBS issues Internationally.  Initially I spoke with most of the 
people who signed up for the group, and began gathering comments and 
suggestions for improved coordination.   However, much of the need for a 
working group was reduced for two reasons; first, the addition of Donald 
Lassere provided a person within our group to focus exclusively on 
international coordination, and secondly, the Global Public Affairs 
reorganizations this year solved many of the jurisdictional questions that 
were highlighted by many in my working group.  After the re-org, we saw 
little reason to continue the working group.  

The group did serve as a good sounding board for people to comment on 
communications strategies and  better coordination within Government/Public 
Affairs.  Many of these strategies (particularly more relationship building 
internally) were implemented.  Additionally, the experience was a good one 
simply because it offered an opportunity to better educate other group 
members on EBS and telecommunications in general.

I would not recommend re-forming the group at this time.  I think many of the 
goals the group was initially formed for are actually being achieved now 
through better organizational structures and closer collaboration between EBS 
support personnel and International group members.

Many of the EBS related topics that deserve a collaborative, cross-functional 
process are being examined through informal, ad-hoc working groups now.  For 
instance, based on concerns raised at a recent EBS/Government Affairs 
off-site, we now have an international regulatory/tax/legal working group.  
This group is comprised of participants from Rick Shapiro's group, Mark 
Schroeder's group and EBS commercial support organizations.    

I am a little unclear on what personal feedback you want on group members.  
Please advise what format I should address this in, since I am not a reviewer 
for almost anyone who was in my group.  Suffice to say, everyone was helpful 
during the brief time the working group was in effect.   But I can give more 
detail on individuals if you would like.

Thanks for the opportunity to lead a working group (even for such a short 
time!) and please let me know if I can provide any additional information.  

Best, Scott

The Regulatory Risk WG status --

1. It operated until Project Summer got going in full swing.  We have been 
doing some work lately on Due Diligence framework.  The EBR took some time 
away from the on-going work.

2. Accomplishments -

a. The key thing that we accomplished was to put together a Due Diligence 
framework (which will be on the web page John and Gia are putting together).  
The idea is that Enron should learn from its prior activities (what risks 
associated with key deals)

b. The WG also was instrumental in supporting our analysis of the Top 20 
(most of the key risks were managed by people on the WG).

3. Continuing -

Yes.  Although the WG efforts have to focus on improving the overall culture 
and support for EGA Reg Risk activities.  Also, the WG needs to focus on how 
to grow GA Origination.  I would like to see John and Gia take the lead and 
really work to make this a key part of the knowledge activities.  The WG must 
become the place were we disseminate the key ideas from our activities.

Any further questions, please let me know.

Jim

		 Subject: WORKING GROUP PROGRESS

Please provide me an update on the progress of the working group you have led 
this year.  There are several things I would like you to cover in this regard.

Did the working group function through the year or was it terminated (I 
recognize there may be good reasons for the latter, but would like to 
understand those reasons).

What did the group accomplish?

Would you recommend continuing it?   Any changes?

Are there other topics we should consider for working groups in the future?  
Any changes to the working group process itself?

Please provide input on the individuals you worked with.  You should be able 
to do this through the PEP system.  If you cannot, please provide the 
feedback by confidential e-mail to me.  Because the PRC is coming up soon, 
please provide the feedback by December 1.

I attach a draft agenda for the next meeting of the Japan Working group which 
is scheduled for next Thursday 8 June at 8am (Tokyo) 7am (Singapore) and 
Wednesday 7 June 6pm (Houston). As usual the meeting will last for 1 hour.

You will note that the agenda includes an item to discuss the scope of the 
working group. While the working group should remain a forum for the exchange 
of ideas across functions within the Public Affairs group, it will be 
proposed that the group be expanded to cover the other east Asian regions in 
which members of the Public Affairs group currently operate. To this end, 
Mike Dahlke (Korea), David Merrill (SE Asia) and Rob McGrory (Australia) have 
been invited to join the meeting.

Call in details and minutes from the last meeting will be circulated prior to 
the conference call.

Please let me know if you are unable to attend the meeting or have any 
comments in relation to the draft agenda.



kind regards
