Subject: Greg Smith of Cynet called me just now


and informed me that the $2.2 million HEOF committed to Cynet was in
escrow as of September 9, and not actually invested in cynet itself as
the escrow was pending the rescission financing.  The actual financing
closed in December of 1999.  It turned out that HEOF THEN (not before)
invested not only the $2.2 million that was in escrow as of the valuation
date but an additional $220,000.

I think the valuation implications are obvious.

I took the liberty of handling this directly with Greg; if you have any
other questions, please feel free to call him.

This just leaves Creole Shack (Roland Curry) who has never gotten back to
me, and we are done with our calls and can proceed to finalize our
reports.

Richard,

Scarlet sent me a fax asking about the audit and significant issues 
correspondence we had not sent to Intrust.  This is Shelly Butler's, our 
comptroller, notes on the issue.  As you can see, she has been in contact 
with Intrust and informed them of the issues relating to the the documents 
required under the LP agreement.

Thanks,
Mark

Subject: HEOF Audit & Intrust Communications

January 5 Sent correspondence reminding the investments that K-1's were due 
March 31.

March 24 Contacted by Jennifer at Intrust  regarding the K-1 for HEOF and 
CCC.  I informed her the CCC K-1 would come from CCC and to contact Steven 
Hamaker.  I sent an email to Lanette Earnest regarding the HEOF K-1 status.  
However, at that time we did not have all of the investment K-1's.

April 13  Spoke to Jennifer at Intrust.  Advised her we were still working on 
getting the investment K-1's so that our tax return could be prepared.  The 
audit would follow as well.

April 18 thru June 13  Worked with Enron tax department to facilitate 
preparation of the HEOF return.  Advised Amy Jon in tax that Jennifer was the 
Intrust contact.

April 19  Met with Angeles Beltri in ENA to discuss their audit procedures 
and get Arthur Andersen contact information.

Last week of Aprilor first week of May? Contacted Andy Schuleman at AA 
regarding audit

May 10   Submitted 1999 HEOF financial statements, investment schedule, and 
partnership agreement copies to AA for review.

May 16  Andy left message that since this roles to Corp that Corp should 
contact me regarding an audit.

May 16  Contacted by Chris Herbold with AA to set up meeting.  

May 24  Spoke with Chris and agreed to meet when we had the information ready 
for footnotes, etc.

Mark, there were numerous emails between myself and the tax department 
regarding the preparation of the return but I don't think they would have any 
relevance for Intrust.  I will contact Corp today regarding the footnotes.

Thanks,
Shelly

Subject: Appraisers' conference call results and next steps


Barbara Rayner and her team, Marlene Timberlake and her team (except for
Malcolm, who was unfortunately not available) and Randy teleconferenced
this morning as scheduled.  Here is what resulted:

1. We all think we can have values ready by Friday 8/31, but not full
reports which explain how we got to them and which are in formats
suitable for submission.  We need perhaps another week (but not a great
deal longer) to have suitable reports completed.  We believe this will
not be too much of a problem, based on Barbara's and Marlene's
discussions with respective counsels.

2. We all appear to be missing financial statements for Beal's Town car
for the year 1997.  Could Scarlett see if they are available and get them
to us?

3. There was minor confusion regarding Call Center as to which financial
forecast should be used.  There are at least three, but they are not
appreciably different.  Rand used the forecast accompanying the DASH.
Scarlett might want to double check to see which one is appropriate, if
this can be determined.  Not a major issue.

3. With regard to Tim's letter of 8/16 and Scarlett's response on 8/18:

A. None of us were influenced in any way by the Enron valuation numbers
submitted along with the Enron materials.  We are each preparing an
independent opinion.

B. On the Call Center interest, we will all address the issue of the
warrants: Rand pointed out that the warrants did not all vest
immediately, and that the 95.58% ownership assumption would incorrectly
reflect this.  I believe we all agreed that 82.3% is the proper ownership
interest as of 9/5/99, subject to revisiting the issue independently.

C. Everyone is treating Cynet as a separate item.  We all agree that
there is a legal issue as to whether an investment was made as of the
valuation date.  That is not an appraisal issue.

D. On the final accounting and the formula calculations, we would all
like the attorneys to explain to us exactly how these are to be treated.
Rand in particular is unclear as to how the final calculation should be
done.  We can discuss this at our Monday conference call, which Rand will
set up (through AT&T: they will call each of us) at 2:00 P.M. eastern
time, 1:00 Dallas.

4. We were unanimous in deciding that now is not the right time to share
results for several reasons:

A. We do not want to do anything that would contravene the Partnership
Agreement which might cause all of our good work (editorial comment!) to
be tossed out.
B. Sharing of "numbers only" results without final reports giving their
rationales is useless.
C. If we were to share "everything but the conclusions" now, we might
waste a great deal of time and money on minutiae, irrelevant things, or
arguments about issues on which appraisers can have legitimate
differences of opinion.

We propose instead the following:

A. We will each prepare reports and submit them as soon as possible
(relative to the 8/31 goal) as planned.  We will each submit full reports
that detail how we developed our conclusions, as well as what they are.

B. Counsels can then decide what they would like to do.  If they wish to
accept our reports and proceed, we are done.  If counsels agree
alternatively that they would like the appraisers to exchange reports, we
are equally amenable to that.  Each of us could then read the other
reports and (assuming counsels authorize this) reconsider our own
conclusions and revise them (if warranted) and/or comment on the others
in a constructive manner.  Again, we do not want to do anything that
would jeopardize the validity of what we have accomplished so far, but we
all want to cooperate to get this matter resolved.

I will talk with you all on Monday afternoon.

Bonnie, I have reviewed the additional pleadings you forwarded with respect 
to the above.  I don't see where there is a Cause of Action which would have 
triggered a defense obligation prior to now.  Our payment of legal fees and 
costs will be effected from the date this lawsuit was served (9/8/00).  We 
will only be responsible for the legal fees and costs associated with 
defending this matter.  Thus, if the same law firm is used on this matter as 
on the previously filed litigation, we will need to make sure they understand 
how to bill on this matter (separate billing may be needed).  An Engagement 
Agreement will be needed as well.

Please call me to discuss.  Do we know why the other litigation was abated?  
Does this mean that retained counsel will simply be performing tasks 
associated with this matter?  Please advise.

Thanks,

Rob

I received a call from Pryor Counts Inc. regarding a valuation of HEOF.  I
gave them some vague responses, but wanted to confirm that these inquiries
