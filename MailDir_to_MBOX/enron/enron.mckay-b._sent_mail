Thanks man I feel like the old man that I am. I only have 5 years until it 
gets really bad. Hunting was great the dog did great, he tried to attack a 
bull and went tearing through the brush I thought that I would never find 
him. After he settled down he did great. Thanks for keeping the family. 
Tiffany told me that you guys taught her how to CALL THE HOGS. Brad

Rex: I have an article to fax to you please send me your fax #. I hope all is 
well in Amarillo. Longhorns look good, this weekend will be a good test for 
them. Tiff and the kids are great. Both kids are very excited to be in 
school, lets hope that this enthusiasm last for another 16 years. Brad

I was the one that talked to David Behrman. We talked about splitting out the 
Algonquin Citygate prices. Why didn't you mention Algonquin in the Gas Daily 
article?

Mer Mer: I was amazed to see that they had a record of me it must have been 
when I went streaking through the RICE campus one late night. The campus 
police told me that they were the only ones with the file and that no one 
else would have access. What a complete bummer. Should I call the FBI?
