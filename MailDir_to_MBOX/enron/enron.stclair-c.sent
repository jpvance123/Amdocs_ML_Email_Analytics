David:
Thanks for your e-mail.  With respect to one of your points, we have in the 
past agreed to modify Section 4(b) of the ETA by adding the following at the 
end:  "unless such access, entry, omission or action arises from acts or 
omissions of Enron and its directors, officers, employees, agents or 
contrcators.''  Alos, with respect to the Deemed ISDA issue, for ENA or ECC 
trades, we do not consider the Deemed ISDA to constitute a "Master Agreement" 
and our deemed ISDA counterparties are required to accept the GTC's before 
trading.  Are the rules different in Australia?
Carol

Some of the 8 week sick pay will be paid at 100% (4 weeks I believe) and some 
at 90%.  Therefore, please enter my vacation time as vacation time so I get 
paid 100% and not 90%.  Thanks.  Call us if you have any questions.  Thanks.

I understand that we want to put a second Raptor transaction in place before 
the end of the month. One major difference from Raptor 1 is that no stock 
from the UBS position will be involved. 

Anne, Will we be getting a fairness opinion on this deal? We also need to 
think about whether we'll need to get full board or executive committee 
approval.

Thanks!

Hi Mark,

Please forward this information to the time-keeper in order that her time off 
will be coded  correctly. An alternative would be for Carol to complete her 
timesheets before she leaves.  With SAP this can be done in advance.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks

Michele:

Just to let you know that I have approved the following for Carol:

1. In addition to the 6 weeks that Enron allows for leave, Carol will add to 
that period by using any remaining vacation time that she has for 2000 (I 
believe an additional 10-12 days).

2. After that time is used up, Carol will be on an unpaid leave of absence 
until December 31, 2000.

Please let me know if there is anything else you need.

Mark

Robert:
I am still waiting to hear back from our credit person on some of the credit 
comments that you made, but here is my response to the legal and certain of 
the credit comments:

1. I am okay with the first paragraph of Insert 1.  I would like to talk to 
you about the second paragraph.

2. We have a strong preference and policy towards using Loss rather than 
Market Quotation.

3. Inserts 2, 3, 4 and 5 are okay.  In addition. our tax people are now 
advising us to require the delivery of W-9's to part 3.

4. NY is okay with governing law.

5. On arbitration, other than changing the location, I would prefer to go 
with our language and really didn't see much difference in what you sent 
other than the fact that it was more abbreviated. Did I miss something?

6. In Part 5, Section (e), 10 Business Days is too long.  How about 5?

7. In Part 5, Section (f), your requested change is too narrow for us.  We 
can agree that any calls coming in to or going out from trading, marketing 
and financial/credit personnel will be recorded.  Does that work for you?

8. Insert 7 is okay.


9. Your reduction of the rounding amount is okay.,  

10. Your comments on page 4 of Annex A are okay.

11. Your comment on Annex A, page 5 is problematic for us unless we limit 
posted collateral to LC's only.    

12. On page 6 of Annex A, can we include both the Issuer and the pledgor?

13. Insert 8 is okay, as are the remaining comments on page 7 of Annex A 
except that we need Moody's because it is used in the LC language.

14. On the LC provisions, in 1(a) can we put "either the Issuer or X" and in 
1(b) include your language as an alternative?

15. I need to discuss with you your deletion of clause (ii) of 1(d).  We 
would like the right to draw if an Event of Default has occurred and if no 
payment is owed at such time, to hold it as cash collateral.

16. Raising the guaranty cap is okay as are the chnages that you made in 
Section 2 of the Guaranty.

17. Inserts 10, 11 and 12 are okay.    

18. In Section 6(c), I would like to keep that phrase as it refers to the 
Payment Demand procedure.

19. Your chnages to Section 7 of the Guaranty are okay.

20. We can change governing law to NY but as a matter of enron policy, cannot 
agree to Insert 13.

21. Insert 14 is okay although I may reword it slightly to make it clearer 
that this applies in connection with a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar 
proceeding.

 I am waiting to hear back from my credit person with respect to the Minimum 
Transfer Amount comment, the LC transfer language comment and the language of 
Insert 9.  I look forward to hearing from you.  I will not be in the office 
monday or tuesday.  Alos, we have recently revised our ISDA Schedule to 
include the following language at the end of Part 6.  Sorry for the late 
notice.

Hi Carol:

Here is the Tax Language.

Regards,

Steve

(i)  Section 5(b)(ii) of the Agreement is amended by adding the following
language at the end of clause (2) thereof and before the semicolon therein:

=10_g(a =10_gNet Payment=10_h), provided, however, that, in the event of th=
e receipt
by a party of a Net Payment due to the failure of a Tax to be an
Indemnifiable Tax because of a present or former connection between the
jurisdiction of the government or taxation authority imposing such Tax and
the recipient of such payment or a person related to such recipient, the
relevant date referred to in clause (x) and (y) above shall be the date
which is sixty days prior to the date on which a Transaction is entered
into (rather than the date on which a Transaction is entered into)=10_h.

That's a trick question which I will not answer!!  I have been getting as 
much sleep as Charles will let me for short periods of time.  It's really not 
too bad and sometimes I take a nap in the late afternoon with him.  I'm still 
breast feeding but my doctor said it would be okay to supplement with formula 
so at midday he gets a bottle which allows Bill and I to get out of the house 
for lunch most of the time.  I'm still running/walking in the mornings and 
with Bill at night and i really enjoy the break.  I just can't stay in the 
house all day and night.  Arthur started school yesterday and we've enrolled 
him in a fall tennis camp twice a week.  He has really shown an interest in 
tennis and i hope it continues.  I hope to get back on the court in a few 
weeks but that seems to be the one activity that bothers me the most probably 
because of the stopping and staring and the quick side to side movements.

Bill has been very helpful relieving me for short periods of time although 
there is not much he can do in terms of feeding Charles since that's up to 
me, but I'm glad that he is here with me although there are times when we are 
sick of each other.  Once I start bottle feeding he will be able to do more.

Hope all is well with you.   I hope to maybe be up for a visit next week if I 
can find a time that works.  I'll let you know.  I'm really sorry to hear 
about Jim Grace's baby.  Please keep me posted.  It makes me appreciate more 
what we have.

Russell:
Here is a summary of the ownership chain of Global Companies LLC:

1. Its members are Global Petroleum Corp. ("GPC"), YPF Distribution Company 
("YPF") and Montello Oil Corporation ("Montello").  From what they sent to 
us, I could not tell the ownership percentages.

2. The affairs of Global are managed by a "Board of Governors" who are 
selected by the members.  Specifically, GPC and Montello collectively get to 
choose 3 board members and YPF gets to choose 3 board members.

I your credit worksheet, you had specified as a "MAC" trigger if YPF, SA 
fails to own at least 51% of Global Companies.  Is this the same entity as 
YPF Distribution Company?  Do you want this as a MAC or as an Additional 
Event of Default or Termination Event?

Thought I would try e-mailing you since using the phone is more of a 
challenge.  So far so good although I can't say that we are on any type of 
schedule.  Before I forget, what is the name of the breast pump that you are 
using?  Looks like the one that I have is not that great.  How many ounces 
should I expect to be able to pump?  I'm trying to judge whether I should 
keep this pump.  Anyway, back to Charles Eugene, he is pretty much of a night 
owl so i try to sleep when he does when I can.  We are ion a feeding frenzy 
every 21/2 to 3 hours and I'm hoping I can extend that at night soon.  Any 
suggestions?  What type of formula do you use?  Alos, do you have any secret 
methods for putting Jillian down to sleep?  Do you let her suck on a 
pacifier?  All Charles wants to do is suck on me.  Arthur was better at 
falling asleep on his own.

How's Jillian doing ?  I can't wait to see a picture of her and I will be 
sending out pictures soon.  Arthur is adjusting well.  He is really into 
tennis now which I am thrilled about.  We were able to convince Bill's mother 
not to come this weekend because I am not quite up to a visit.  I think she 
took it well but you never can tell, but at this point I really don't care 
what she thinks because i am not ready for her to visit until I'm more mobile 
which hopefully I will be in another week or 2.



Sue,
How are you and Cate doing?  Can you talk to mom about scheduling a  visit so 
that we can schedule a christening date?  Bill's older sister's husband Bill 
is the godfather.  Mom mentioned late August but I would like to pin 
something down soon so that we can make the necessary arrangements.


Well, I've got to go as I hear Charles waking up.  Take care both of you and 
call or write me.

Love, Carol

Rod:
The following are the credit issues that they raised in their comments:

1. Cross default threshold - instead of $100,000,000 they want a 3% of equity 
test.

2. Credit Event Upon Merger - they want to delete the amendment language in 
our Schedule

3. MAC Trigger - this currently is an Event of Default.  They want to make it 
a Termination Event.  Also, they want to add to the trigger going below a 
Baa3 rating by Moody's.

4.  In the financial reporting section, they want to add on our side a 
requirement that we deliver to them any financial or business report that we 
make available to our shareholders or that we file with the SEC or bank 
regulatory authorities

5. In the Netting language, they have excluded FX and Currency Option 
transactions.

6. In the setoff language, they have limited the trigger to the designation 
of an Early Termination date because of the Termination Event Credit Event 
Upon Merger.  Alos, they want setoff to apply to "matured and unmatured" 
obligations.

7. They don't want a cap on the Enron Guaranty

8. In the Termination section where we specify Loss and Second method that 
have an interesting rider (insert 2) that modifies how the Second Method 
works.  I'm still trying to understand what this language does but it appears 
to qualify any payments on termination that the Non-Defaulting Party would 
have to make to the Defaulting Party.

I will send you a copy of their comments and hopefully we will talk to them 
about this next week.

  I have discussed your proposed language with Brant Reves,
our credit person, and
  we are okay with the concept except that we would like for
the ratings trigger
  to be based only on either a drop in the S&P rating or a
failure to have an S&P
  rating.  In addition, Brant has advised me that should we
put in place a CSA,
  that the following would be the credit matrix for collateral
threshold:

  BB to BB+  $2,500,000
  Below BB  Zero

  I look forward to hearing from you.  Should we send you our
form of Credit

Mr. Davis:
Susan Flynn passed on to me your comments to the ISDA draft.  Please call me 
when you are ready to discuss.  With respect to the Guaranty amendment that 
we had requested, it is just meant to clarify in the termination section that 
if the Guaranty is terminated then the Guarantor is still responsible for all 
of the Counterparty's obligations with respect to any transactions that were 
entered into prior to the termination date, even if such obligations are 
incurred after the termination date.  I do not feel that the termination 
language, as currently written in both the WPS and Enron Guarantys clearly 
reflects this concept as the language as currently written states that the 
Guaranty "is revocable only with respect to liabilities occurring on or after 
the termination date."    I look forward to hearing from you.

I spoke with our credit people today.  We would like to arrange a call to 
discuss our concerns about Section 5 of the Guaranty with me, our credit 
people, your counsel and your credit person or someone that can make a 
decision if we propose a change to the Guaranty.  Can you let me know who 
these people are (and their phone numbers) so that we can arrange a call?  We 
understand fully your need for the Section 5 language, but we would like to 
explore with your people whether your concerns can be addressed in a 
different manner.  Thanks.

Tanya left a message for Cindy and offerred $10M as a cap for each Guaranty.  
The reason for the cushion is to protect the party who terminates at a time 
when its exposure is close to the credit threshold and by the time that the 
date is set and the amount is calculated there is a move in the market that 
results in its exposure being above the threshold.

There is one issue that is left to resolve.  In the CSA, we define 
independent amount as any amount specified for a party in any Confirmation or 
if no amount is specified, 0.  They wnat to either delete this entirely or 
add language requiring some type of notice to the credit dept. of the party 
that has to put up the independent amount before it becomes effective.  What 
do you want to do?

		 Subject: Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corporation - UK and US swaps

Rod,

Enron North America is looking to enter into power swaps with Kaiser Aluminum 
& Chemical Corporation starting June 2001.  I'm seeing in the credit system 
that MG plc has forward financial metals positions with Kaiser, however I 
need clarification on whether the swaps are done with Kaiser Aluminum & 
Chemical Corporation or Kaiser Aluminum International Inc.  Secondly, is 
there a Master ISDA Agreement governing those swaps?  In pulling the mtm 
monthly breakout, it appears that MG plc is OTM north of $10MM US and the 
liquidation of that portfolio occurs mostly in cal '02.

Given Kaiser's limited credit line, I'd like to look into the potential of 
setting off financial exposures in the UK and US in cases of default.  Kaiser 
is looking at other businesses with Enron and this could be quite fruitful to 
tap into in order to increase trading liquidity going forward.

In summary, we need to answer at minimum the following:
? confirmation of which Kaiser entity is financial transacting with MG plc
? volatility of the metal positions that go out to Jan '04 to ensure how 
quickly this out-of-the-money position can move
? what type of paper is confirming the swaps (whether long-form confirms or 
Master ISDA)
? what credit/legal terms and laws may affect our efforts to establish a 
Netting Agreement for UK and US financial

Can you help me in coordinating a meeting with London legal/credit and 
Portland credit/Houston legal to discuss pertinent issues associated with a 
Netting Agreement between Kaiser (single entity or multiple entities) and 
Enron entities (MG plc and ENA) as soon as possible.  Please let me know your 
thoughts to the above and who we need to contact to get the above points 
addressed.  In Houston legal, Carol St. Clair is available to work on the 
drafting of such a Netting Agreement and is speaking with Sara Shackleton 
about the concept as well.

Please let me know as soon as possible your comments to the above and in 
setting up a conference call to push this forward.

Thanks,
Tracy

No problem on the crib.  As for Mexico setoff, I am aware.  I was under the 
impression that even setoff among common entities is questionable.  My 
rationale is that we will almost certainly trade with any given cp through 
one Enron entity or the other, and not both.  If I am wrong, we will manage 
the process internally (i.e. cut the cp's credit line in half).

Thanks.  I expect to get a new draft of the Schedules from DB later today.  
As for the crib, it is perfect and Bill and a friend managed to put it 
together.  Thanks so much for lending it to us.  I'm hoping that we will have 
a child to put in it within the next week.  As for Mexico, the issue there is 
that they do not recognize setoff in bankruptcy so that if deals are done 
with 2 different Enron counterparties we will not be able to setoff.

I don't know if you are still handling this.  We are close to getting this 
finalized.  One credit comment from them that I need someone's thoughts on.  
They want the Issuer of LC's to maintain a credit rating of A from S&P and A2 
from Moody's.  We usually put A- and A3.  are you okay with this?  If I need 
to run this by someone else please let me know.

Yes, and I've assumed that she is coming.  I also invited Jason and asked him 
to get back to you.  Let's wait and see how large the group is and decide if 
we need to relocate if that is possible.  Might there be any conference rooms 
that are larger if we need it (like on 44)?  If not, we will make do but will 
need someone to bring us some extra chairs.

Rod:
Do you and Diana have a copy of the ISDA master between ENA and Kaiser?  If 
not, here is a summary of some of the Kaiser credit related provisions:

 1. $30,000,000 cross default threshold

2. MAC Event of Default - As to Kaiser, a MAC occurs if either an Event of 
Default occurs under the 2/15/94 Credit Agreement with BankAmerica or its 
credit rating drops to B- or below by S&P and B3  or below by Moody's.  In 
each case, if they deliver collateral, no Event of Default occurs.

3. Collateral Threshold equal to ENA's Net Exposure which goes to zero if a 
MAC occurs and there is a failure to deliver collateral within 90 days or an 
Event of Default occurs.

4. $1,000,000 rounding amounts


With respect to setoff rights, I spoke with David Mitchell about this and if 
it turns out that both types of swap transactions are done with the same 
Kaiser entity but different Enron entities and the metals ISDA has 
appropriate setoff language, then we feel fairly comfortable that upon a 
Kaiser bankruptcy filing in the US, we would be able to exercise setoff 
rights.


What is the next step?

Hi Carol.  Great to hear from you.  I hope all is going well.  

Diana Higgins who is a manager (credit) in the metal area will be the 
principal credit person.  I would say that Kaiser is a low grade credit and 
the contract should be robust with early termination and collateral rights.

Rod and Paul:
I have checked the ISDA between Kaiser and ENA and it has our standard setoff 
language which permits setoff of amounts owed by or to the Non-Defaulting 
Party and its Affiliates against amounts owed by or to the Defaulting Party 
under the ISDA and other agreements.  Please call me once you have located 
the Metals agreement as Greg indicated to me in a voice mail that he needs an 
answer this morning.

Rod,
If we get comfortable on the legal side with this arrangement, are there 
other credit issues that need to be considered?

Does anyone know why in our form of LC we have language that seems to qualify 
Section 13(b) of the UCP which sets forth the amount of time that the issuing 
bank has to honor drafts?  I don't see anywhere in our form where we modify 
this Section.  Here ios the current version that we are using.

It looks like we may have to change the Houston terminations phone number. 
Can you tell me how many customers will be affected?

I will forward a new number once known (probably later this week). Will Tana

Marianne:
The following are my comments:

1. In Section 1.1, there should be a parentheses after etc. in the 5th line.

2. In Section 3.1, in the last sentence after the proviso insert "a" before 
the word "change" and after the word "in".

3. In Section 6.1, change 20 Business Days to 20 days.  Also, add a semicolon 
at the end of clause (i).

4. In Section 6.2.1 I'll just note that the discount rate sentence I think is 
still an open issue.

5. In Section 6.3, clause (c) should be reworded to fit with the language in 
the beginning of the Section.

6. Capitalize the word "facility" in the definition of Average Annual Load 
Factor.

7. Delete the definition of Costs as it is already defined in Section 6.2.1.

8. Where is the defined term Govt Authority used?

9. In the GTC, the ECP rep should also apply to EESI.  Also, in the 7th line 
of the reps add the word "into" after the word "entered" and before the word 
"this".

10. In Collateral Requests, insert a comma after deposit in the last line.  I 
will also add granting/perfection language.

11. In Events of Default, clause (a) refers to a dispute section which I'm 
not sure exists.  In clause (e), delete the "s": from the word consolidation.

12. Remedies should be deleted as it is already covered in Section 6.1.

13. In UCC/Disclaimer of warranties, add a clause (c).

I would add setoff language.

		 Subject: Mid Market Power Form/ENA Changes

Carol:

I have attempted to incorporate the changes that Jim has incorporated in our 
long form power agreement which ENA has suggested to date into the short 
form.  Attached please find a sample short form (for the Con Ed market) for 
your review.  

Please note the following as you review:

1.  The short forms do not contain the optionality relating to our performing 
billing services -- all of our midmarket  forms anticipate that we will act 
as customer's billing agent and that we will collect all amounts due related 
to T&D and the like from the customer (and reflect same on our invoice) and 
pass those amounts on to the customer's utility.
2.  I did not include a "Setoff" provision in this draft, mainly because the 
vast majority of the time, we will not, nor will an affiliate, have another 
agreement in place with these customers.  If you feel strongly about our 
including a setoff provision, we will do so.
3.  The change in law provision reads a bit differently from the long form -- 
the thinking here is that the long form language is very lengthy and rather 
harsh (and we've had great difficulty selling it in the past).  Taking into 
consideration this class of customer, we decided to include certain items, 
including our inability to cover our costs due to a change in law, rules or 
practices as a "force majeure event" in an effort to soften the approach (see 
the GTCs).  Also we do not address calculation of a termination payment in 
the event of a change in law as the long form does -- again, more in the 
interest of "saving space" than anything else...

Let us know your thoughts on this document and if you are comfortable with 
our using this until such time as the hybrid form is launched.  If you are 
comfortable, we will drive these changes into our other midmarket power forms.

Thanks again for your help with this project,

Marianne

P.S.  Please be sure to copy Sarah Dietrich and Jennifer Hillegonds on your 
response -- they will be taking this project during my "hiatus"  --  I am 
moving to PA on Friday of this week, and will be out of pocket through 
approximately 7/16.  I will start up again in mid-July...

Shari:
I am negotiating an ISDA with Dresdner Bank and I have the following 
questions concerning their mark-up of the FX/Currency Option language:

1. In the EMU Protocol language they want to add a reference to Section 6.  
I'm not sure why but wanted your thoughts on this.  Are there any 
circumstances under which we do not adopt the Protocol provisions?

2. They want to define the FX Definitions as the 1998 FX and Currency Option 
Definitions as amended and supplemented by the 1998 ISDA Euro Definitions.  
Is this okay?  What is the effect of this?  Should we change our form to do 
this?  With respect generally to the FX and Currency Option Definitions, as a 
general rule are they always incorporated by reference into the terms of any 
FX and Currency Option transaction even if it is electronically confirmed?  
They wanted to add language to that section of our form specifically stating 
this.

Thanks in advance for your help.

 We're still trying for the Enron preferred route of not submitting
to jurisdiction, but somehow the new language slipped in anyway.  If it does
have to stay, I'll double check to make sure it is the language that Enron
accepts when forced to submit to jurisdiction in NY.  I believe it is.

This looked fine.  In the first paragraph please change the name from Enron 
Risk Management Services Corp. to Enron North America Corp.  I look forward 
to receiving the paperwork from you and getting this wrapped up.

Brad and John:
We have not sent out the ISDA draft on energen because I need calrification 
on the following points:

1. Is the $75MM Guaranty cap meant to cover both physical and financial 
combined or are we doing separate Guarantys each with a $75MM cap amount?

2. How does the $50MM collateral threshold work?  I noticed in the physical 
master that it appears as if we subtract from the $50MM threshold our 
exposure under the ISDA to arrive at the Counterparty's threshold, although 
the language in the physical says "the exposure" and it is not clear whose 
exposure they are talking about.  Is that how it is suppposed to work?

Steven :
I have finally had a chance to go over the outstanding credit issues with Rod 
Nelson, our credit person, and here are his responses:

1. We cannot agree to the additional language in the cross-default 
provision.  We need a trigger that is not subject to interpretation and 
second-guessing and the language that you proposed does just that.  

2. On credit event upon merger, we would prefer to define the standard for 
"materially weaker" as below investment grade.  Is that a problem for you?

3. With respect to payment netting, we would prefer that netting apply to 
Transactions that are of the same product line (i.e. all commodity swaps).  
Is that a problem for you?  We thought that your operational issue had to do 
more with netting across product lines.

4. In the Credit Support Annex, we would prefer that the number of days to 
resolve disputes over exposure and/or value be 2 business days instead of 1.  

I am in the process of reviewing the new drafts of ISDA and CSA Schedules and 
will get back to you shortly on remaining comments.

I have finally heard back from my credit person on all of the credit points 
that I wanted him to confirm.  The only change that he raised was on the 
cross default where he said that the threshold was $100,000,000 for the 
Credit Support Providers and $10,000,000 for each party.    I will send you a 
new mark up on that.  Otherwise, everything else credit wise was as stated in 
your draft.

		 Subject: New Master Energy Agreement Form

Attached for your review is the latest version of the new master form we have 
been working on.  We have tried to incorporate all of the changes and 
comments we have received in our last three offsite meetings.  We have left 
some questions and open issues in brackets.  I addition, we have highlighted 
some areas for extra attention, some of which are explained below:

Section 1.2:  The term of the master is month to month; each transaction will 
have a specific term, as set forth in the applicable confirmation
Section 1.3:  We need to make a final decision on whether all credit terms 
will be in the master or whether some will be in the confirmation
Section 1.4:  We have made the usage bands monthly by account; this can 
easily be changed if there is business consensus to do so.
Section 2.7:  Instead of utility non-performance (physical or financial) 
being an event of force majeure, we have added a new section addressing 
that.  It provides for a free termination by EES in such event; we need to 
consider whether there should be a payment.
Section 3.1:  subsections (v), (vi) and (vii) need credit review as indicated
Section 3.3:  termination payments are now bilateral (defaulting party gets 
paid if non-defaulting party has a Gain).
Sections 3.6 and 3.7:  Probably can be shortened while keeping the concepts; 
is the first sentence of Sec. 3.7 needed?
Section 3.9:  Need input on highlighted language; need to decide whether we 
want a bilateral early termination payment here.
Special Utility Charges definition: we pass through surcharges here.
Assignment: do we want to give customer right to assign without consent in 
any circumstances (like to an affiliate)?
Confirm: Transaction Term:  need to confirm that this is how we want 
start/end dates to be determined.

I left on your chair the commnets to the amendment agreements.  Could you 
please confirm with Lisa that it makes sense to have the additional 
bankruptcy termination enevts as "automatic" triggers in your document when 
in the fianncial master it is drafted as an election.  Please e-mail the 
revised agreement to KCS' counsel - Zachary May and copy Harry Stout.

I saw it twice with Arthur and then he saw it once with my dad!  We've also 
seen "Meet the parents" twice and Bill took his mom to see it this week.  
It's really good.

I forgot to tell you that they had Big Momma's House on the plane to Vegas.  
It was hysterical.  Ric had to tell me to quiet down!  It was so funny!

Could you please call me at ext. 33989 and explain to me how this termination 
procedure works so that I can describe it in the ETA amendments that I am 
preparing for those customers that have requested the right to terminate?  
Thanks.

Here is a first cut at where things stand on projects that I am handling.  I 
will continue to update it as long as I am here, but thought you should have 
it just in case.  All of these files are on top of the file cabinets near the

Attached is the standard Coastal guaranty form we use for ISDAs.? I 
understand this ISDA is just for these financial instruments and not for the 
physical side of the business.? Please give me your comments, if any.

We will split the guaranty with a Coastal guaranty for Engage US and 
Westcoast for Engage Canada.?? Since the new threshold is $10 million, the 
Coastal guaranty cap is $10 million.?

		 Subject: Domain Transfer Agreement

Mark:
I just wanted to update you on where things stand currently with respect to 
the Domain Name Transfer Agreement that we are negotiating with Risk 
Management Solutions, Inc.  After visiting with Scott about the reps and 
warranties, he became concerned about the overall scope of the agreement and 
in particular, what in addition to the URL domain name (weather-desk.com) EEL 
was being asked to transfer and the restrictions that RMS wanted to place on 
EEL with respect to this Domain Name and "any variations thereof."   We went 
back to RMS and told them basically that all we were willing to do was 
transfer them the URL domain name with no strings attached.  I'm not sure 
that this will be acceptable to them given their future intentions which is 
to acquire from another third party the name "weatherdesk.com" , register it 
and use it with respect to the products that they offer.

All of these discussions that we have had over the past week with respect to 
our domain name have lead Seth, Scott and I to question what Enron's intent 
is with respect to the name or any variations thereof given the fact that 
according to Scott we have submitted applications to register similar names.  
We were hoping that you could help us answer this question or at least lead 
us to the right people that could.  It seems odd that we would be wiling to 
transfer this name and yet feel that it is important to pursue registering 
these other names.  I look forward to hearing from you.

I agree with you.  I had thought about waiting to execute the Transfer
Agreement until after we had executed the new ISDA and (and thus were doing
all subsequent trades as UtiliCorp) and dating the Transfer Agreement
accordingly.  I think it is a more legally sound way of handling the whole
issue.  Why don't you wait until I send you the fully executed ISDA and we
have the correct name in your Enron Online database, and then redate and
send the Transfer Agreement?

Why don't you go ahead and send over your CSA form?  I think the idea here
is to have it fully negotiated in advance.  As to the idea of just using
S&P, I will pass that along to our Treasury Dept.

  I have discussed your proposed language with Brant Reves,
our credit person, and
  we are okay with the concept except that we would like for
the ratings trigger
  to be based only on either a drop in the S&P rating or a
failure to have an S&P
  rating.  In addition, Brant has advised me that should we
put in place a CSA,
  that the following would be the credit matrix for collateral
threshold:

  BB to BB+  $2,500,000
  Below BB  Zero

  I look forward to hearing from you.  Should we send you our
form of Credit
  Support Annex?

Hi,

The sick leave policy is 4 weeks at 100% and 22 weeks at 90%.  So some of 
that time will fall into the 90% pay.

Take care!

Hi Mark,

Please forward this information to the time-keeper in order that her time off 
will be coded  correctly. An alternative would be for Carol to complete her 
timesheets before she leaves.  With SAP this can be done in advance.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Michele:

Just to let you know that I have approved the following for Carol:

1. In addition to the 6 weeks that Enron allows for leave, Carol will add to 
that period by using any remaining vacation time that she has for 2000 (I 
believe an additional 10-12 days).

2. After that time is used up, Carol will be on an unpaid leave of absence 
until December 31, 2000.

Please let me know if there is anything else you need.

Mark

I will take a look at this either tonite or in the morning.  Since the UEI 
Holdings Guaranty which we reference in paragraph 9 of the Amendment covered 
both US and Canada transactions, I don't think that we can say that it has 
been terminated until we sign up the Engage Canada deal.  Can you add 
language to the Coastal Guaranty that takes care of this instead.  I would 
prefer to say in paragraph 9 of the Engage US amendment that "The Guaranty of 
Party B dated as of May 19, 1997, heretofore delivered by UEI Holdings Inc., 
formerly known as Union Energy Inc. in favor of Party A as beneficiary, is 
hereby replaced by an executed Guaranty from Coastal Corporation, a copy of 
which is attached hereto as Exhibit B but only with respect to the 
obligations of party B under the Master Agreement that are guaranteed 
thereunder."  Let me know what you think.

Attached is the standard Coastal guaranty form we use for ISDAs.? I 
understand this ISDA is just for these financial instruments and not for the 
physical side of the business.? Please give me your comments, if any.

We will split the guaranty with a Coastal guaranty for Engage US and 
Westcoast for Engage Canada.?? Since the new threshold is $10 million, the 
Coastal guaranty cap is $10 million.?

		 Subject: Mid Market Power Form/ENA Changes

Carol:

I have attempted to incorporate the changes that Jim has incorporated in our 
long form power agreement which ENA has suggested to date into the short 
form.  Attached please find a sample short form (for the Con Ed market) for 
your review.  

Please note the following as you review:

1.  The short forms do not contain the optionality relating to our performing 
billing services -- all of our midmarket  forms anticipate that we will act 
as customer's billing agent and that we will collect all amounts due related 
to T&D and the like from the customer (and reflect same on our invoice) and 
pass those amounts on to the customer's utility.
2.  I did not include a "Setoff" provision in this draft, mainly because the 
vast majority of the time, we will not, nor will an affiliate, have another 
agreement in place with these customers.  If you feel strongly about our 
including a setoff provision, we will do so.
3.  The change in law provision reads a bit differently from the long form -- 
the thinking here is that the long form language is very lengthy and rather 
harsh (and we've had great difficulty selling it in the past).  Taking into 
consideration this class of customer, we decided to include certain items, 
including our inability to cover our costs due to a change in law, rules or 
practices as a "force majeure event" in an effort to soften the approach (see 
the GTCs).  Also we do not address calculation of a termination payment in 
the event of a change in law as the long form does -- again, more in the 
interest of "saving space" than anything else...

Let us know your thoughts on this document and if you are comfortable with 
our using this until such time as the hybrid form is launched.  If you are 
comfortable, we will drive these changes into our other midmarket power forms.

Thanks again for your help with this project,

Marianne

P.S.  Please be sure to copy Sarah Dietrich and Jennifer Hillegonds on your 
response -- they will be taking this project during my "hiatus"  --  I am 
moving to PA on Friday of this week, and will be out of pocket through 
approximately 7/16.  I will start up again in mid-July...

Carol,

1. We have set up the Master User from Aquila Risk under Utilicorp.  We do 
not require any further paperwork from them, however, we do need them to set 
up their sub-users.  I am going to follow up with Angela Webber at Utilicorp 
tomorrow to make sure that sub users are set up.

2. I will notify you once sub-user accounts have been set up and then wait 
for your instructions as to when we will shut Aquila Risk down for trading.

Thanks,

Subject: Utilicorp

Stephanie and Frank:
Both Susan Bailey and I have spoken with Utilicorp's attorney and here is my 
understanding of where things stand:

1. On Friday, it was my understanding that they submitted their password 
application and that the problem was that the person that they needed to set 
up the sub-user passwords was not in the office.  My understanding is that he 
will be in on Tuesday and that is when they are going to try to set up those 
accounts.  Does that require them to send any paperwork to us?

2. Once the sub-user accounts are set up, then we need to pick a date for the 
Transfer Agreement to become effective.  Since we are changing the date from 
June 16th, this will require someone from Utilicorp to initial the change and 
their attorney wasn't sure when that will happen.  Once the new date is 
picked and initialed, then we can begin trading under Utilicorp's name, but 
nothing should be done until before then.  Either Susan or I will let you 
know when that date is.

Please call me at 33989 if you have any questions.
Carol

I will do that.  Just to clarify, he will need to sign off on all of the 
changes, which I hope I can walk him through.  The only language that I am 
concerned about is what I have marked as "under review".  I will copy you on 
what i send to him as I will edit your draft to make my changes.  I will be 
leaving to go on maternity leave shortly (probably no later than July 14th) 
and if for some reason we don't conclude this, Mark Taylor will handle

Carol, please go ahead and have the 'under review' sections of the draft
read by the Enron Online person for approval, as the remaining comments are
not contentious.
I will send the mark-up to Marketing to see while we await for your reply.

Thank you

Carol, attached is the agreement with the changes you requested and my
suggested wording to Section 4. I trust I picked up your changes correctly,
as they were not too clear on the fax.

Except for two small changes in 4,(adding the word "on" in line 12, and
changing "confirmed" to "executed" in the last line) I did not make the
changes you faxed on 2(g) or 4 as we require some language to carve out of
those limitaions the information we use for our offer. Please see what I
suggested instead of the wording sent last time.

Trust this will be acceptable and we can attach this to a letter agreement
stating this is the ETA. This will also have to be referenced in the
Password Agreement

Russell:
Thanks for your message.  I will take a look at the Transfer Agreement.  I 
just want to make sure that all trades done after May 3rd and before the 
execution date that are being confirmed under ARMS will be transferred to 
Utilicorp.  Alos, in order to change our online system, we need to know when 
the Utilicorp Master will be the operative document so that on and after such 
date, all deals are confirmed under the Master under the Utilicorp name.  Do 
you think that it would be better just to change the effective date of the 
Master and the Transfer Agreement to the date of Utilicorp's execution of the 
Master?

Carol, I wasn't able to open the images you attached to your email, but both
the ISDA and the Transfer and Termination Agreement are dated May 3, 2000.
The only possible concern would be those transactions that we are entering
into between May 3 and the day that the UtiliCorp ISDA is executed, at which
time we will actually enter into trades as UtiliCorp.  However, I believe
that we have worded the Transfer and Termination Agreement in such a manner
that, once such document is executed, all trades done as ARM will fall under
the UtiliCorp ISDA, so there shouldn't be any concerns.

I anticipate having the ISDA Transfer and Termination Agreement executed
within the week.  Feel free to let me know if you you have further
questions/concerns.

We have purchased 30 copies of the referenced book.  It is a short read -- 
about 30-45 minutes.  The copies are located at the clerks' station, EB3808.  
Please read this short story prior to our ENA Legal Conference and then 
return it to the clerks' station so everyone attending the conference will 
have an opportunity to read it prior to the conference.

If we need to develop a form of confirm for this, are you the person that I 
should work with or would someone else handle this?  

Rod,
Since we are doing a separate GTC for this product, we will not be able to 
"net" on any payment date what we owe the counterparty under this product 
against what the counterparty may owe us under other derivative products.  
Are you okay with this?  Alos, we have been assuming that there are no other 
counterparty credit issues with this product since other than the upfront 
premium, payments will be made from us to them.  Are we safe in assuming this?

We still don't have it and we were hoping that someone on the commercial side 
would place a call to J Aron.  We agreed to it weeks ago and there is no 
reason why we shouldn't have it by now.  Since the existing Guaranty does not 
cover the new Master I do not consider the new Master to be effective.   
Apparently there is some confusion on J Aron's part since they keep referring 
to the new Master in their confirms.  I have left a message for their 
counsel, Luanne Giessen, that we do not consider the new Master effective 
until we receive the new Guaranty.  Tana has left numerous messages with her 
alos about getting the Guaranty.

I think we would like to push for an EEI with Morgan.  I will send up a 
credit worksheet ASAP.

Carol,

I read the assignment and reviewed our positions with Morgan and Merchant 
Energy Group of America ("MEGA").  Credit is fine with the assignment.  
However, as a result of 
MEGA assigning its trades to Morgan, our mark-to-market exposure to Morgan 
increases by approximately $27.8mm over the next 18 months.  Although we have 
agreed to post margin to each other in the past, our current Master Energy 
Purchase and Sale Agreement with Morgan does not have any STATED provisions 
for margining.  Consequently, we would like to amend the agreement to include 
collateral thresholds for both Enron and Morgan.  I will discuss this issue 
with Ed and get back to you.

Thanks,
Wendy

Could you please call this guy and let him know that I am out of the office 
today and that I will call him sometime tomorrow.  Also, thanks for your 
message.  My doctor needs to wait until he gets the other doctor's report 
before we can talk so probably nothing will happen until Wednesday morning 
when I see him.  All I can do know is take it easy and try not to think about 
what might happen.  There's not much I can do and the only way that I will 
know that there is a problem is if I start bleeding.  The baby is fine.  He's 
almost 3 pounds and Arthur got to see him today which was great!  Needless to 
say, no more running nad unfortunately for Bill no more sex!  The one funny 
thing that happened was when the doctor was trying to tell us that we could 
not have sex and she didn't want to use the word sex because Arthur was there 
so she used the word "relations".  Bill couldn't understand  what she was 
saying and I know you had to be there but I just cracked up.  I also had a 
good laugh when the doctor found out that I was a runner.  She looked me 
right in the eye and said "no more running" which is what I expected.  Again, 
you had to be there!

Anyway, barring no further problems, I'll be in tomorrow and we'll just take 
it one day at a time.

Carol

It's not clear to me what needs to be done on the file.  Has Paul contacted 
them about his note on 4/7?  If not, call Paul and find out if he wants you 
to make that call as that seems like the logical next step to take.  As far 
as their other comments, we cannot delete the Recording language on page 6 
and in the Confirmation language let's offer up 5 Business days.

Hi Carol:

Enclosed is latest draft.  Please note that I changed DB's Threshold at A+
to bring it into line with Enron's rating.  I also added a sweep-in clause
to deal with the BT Transactions (Section 18).  Please let me know if those
provisions are acceptable.  Subject to internal DB approvals, I think the
other substantive points still open are (i) a Moody's rating for the MAC
clause, (ii) the demand section in the Guaranty, and (iii) determining the
L/C provisions and mechanics.  Please let me know who your replacement on
this matter will be and, if we don't speak before you leave, good luck and
congratulations.

Regards,

Steve

trades) and would feel better if Christina Yoder took a look at this.  I 
understand he will be back in tomorrow and I have left him a voice mail 
message about this.  With respect to the form of Proposal Letter, I would 
prefer that you use the form that I have attached.  With respect to the 
proposed Term Sheet, the paragraph before the "Corrections to Published 
Prices" paragraph refers to an Annex A which if this deal is confirmed under 
an ISDA would not be the correct reference.  Also,  in the disclaimer at the 
end, please change all references of "Williams" to "ENA."    Please call me 
if you have any questions.  If this cannot wait for Christian, perhaps Shari 
Stack could look at it.  Let me know what you want to do.

Please see the e-mails that Susan and I have exchanged.  Since we are still 
confirming deals under ARMS, does the effective date on the Transfer and 
Termination Agreement work?  I want to make sure that it covers all trades 
that have been confirmed with ARMS until we start confirming with Utilicorp.  
Please advise.

Carol,

Not yet.  The master agreement documents were sent out by FED EX on Monday, 
May 8th.

As for the effective date of the (a) Master Agreement and (b) Transfer and 
Termination Agreement, both documents were given an effective date of May 3, 
2000.

Susan:
Has this Master been executed?  I forgot what we specified as the effective 
date of the Transfer and Assignment Agreement with ARMS but we need to make 
absolutely sure that the effective date covers all trades that are done by 
ARMS and that there is no gap between that effective date and the effective 
date of our Master.  Also, please make sure that Tana knows when the 
Utilicorp Master becomes effective so she can notify the online folks.  
Thanks.
Carol

I have received a bill from LeBoeuf for work done in June on the ACE 
insurance matter for a bit over $36,000.  This included around 23 hours by PB 
Wright ($12,000) and 38 hours by SD Avitabile ($13,000).  Does that sound

go to East Power Trading?

		 Subject: Project Hawaii 125-O (Danno B)


Attached are the initial drafts of a closing checklist and the related 
closing documents to pay off and unwind Project Alchemy and place the asset 
into the Project Hawaii structure.  This transaction is structured as a trust 
to trust transfer, which is contemplated in the Amended and Restated Hawaii 
125-O Facility Agreement.  The anticipated closing date for this transaction 
is May 31, 2000.  The only significant missing information in the documents 
is the maturity date and the related auction dates.  Please advise as to the 
maturity date and I will calculate the auction dates.

The documents attached are clean versions in Word.  Immediately following 
this e-mail, I will send a follow-up e-mail with clean versions of each 
document in Word Perfect.  Following that, I will send two e-mails attaching 
copies of the documents marked against the Project Blackbird Unwind and 
related Hawaii 125-O Danno A documents, in both Word and Word Perfect.

Please review the attached documents and call me with any comments or 
questions.  My direct line is 214-659-4461 and my direct fax is 
214-659-4784.  Please let me know if any additional people should be a 
recipient of future e-mails for this transaction.  Also, please forward this 
e-mail to anyone that you are aware of who needs to review the documents and 
has not received this e-mail.

FYI.  Can you and the clerks handle packing up my office?  I may be able to 
help but I don't want to make any commitment  that I can make it up there.  
Hopefully, it won't take that long and the only files that need to be marked 
or perhaps put in the legal assistant area are the files near my window.  If 
the move-out timing slips and happens while you are on vacation, I would 
prefer that it be handled before hand so that the floater doesn't have to 
worry about it.  Let me know what you think.  Sorry to impose but I tried to

It looks like Phase II of our construction project (over where Julia's office 
used to be) will be finished on the 18th so she will be moving into her new 
office that weekend.  I now have the plans for Phase III and it turns out 
your office will be included in the construction area.  Phase III will 
probably start on the 25th.  That could always slip but I wanted to give you 
as much notice as possible.

Hope you are all doing well.  Getting any sleep yet?

I expect to receive from our counsel in Mexico a memo addressing all of the

other than the fact that we cannot offer "securities" to Mexican 
counterparties and they will define in the memo what products would be 
considered securities, but I want to see waht they put down in writing before 
we make any conclusions.  I or Mark will keep you posted.

I just wanted to update you on where things stand currently with respect to 
the Domain Name Transfer Agreement that we are negotiating with Risk 
Management Solutions, Inc.  After visiting with Scott about the reps and 
warranties, he became concerned about the overall scope of the agreement and 
in particular, what in addition to the URL domain name (weather-desk.com) EEL 
was being asked to transfer and the restrictions that RMS wanted to place on 
EEL with respect to this Domain Name and "any variations thereof."   We went 
back to RMS and told them basically that all we were willing to do was 
transfer them the URL domain name with no strings attached.  I'm not sure 
that this will be acceptable to them given their future intentions which is 
to acquire from another third party the name "weatherdesk.com" , register it 
and use it with respect to the products that they offer.

All of these discussions that we have had over the past week with respect to 
our domain name have lead Seth, Scott and I to question what Enron's intent 
is with respect to the name or any variations thereof given the fact that 
according to Scott we have submitted applications to register similar names.  
We were hoping that you could help us answer this question or at least lead 
us to the right people that could.  It seems odd that we would be wiling to 
transfer this name and yet feel that it is important to pursue registering 
these other names.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Sara and Jason:
Here are my initial thoughts on how we can possibly shorten the weather 
confirms that are done under a Master Agreement.  It seems like we could 
amend the Masters to include the following definitions which seem to be used 
in each conform:

Payment Date
NCDC
NWS
HDD
CDD
The Fallback Reference Weather Station procedures - the confirm would 
identify just the Fallback Reference Weather Station
Data Sources

Alos, is it necessary to specify bank account information if that is already 
set forth in the Master?

Carol - Re: the Schedule, here is the new "30-day language" for your review.
Also attached is the Enron Gty you wanted me to e-mail you.  I've made the
other three typo changes you mentioned and am running off final documents
for execution.  I will fed ex them to you this evening after obtaining
signatures on this end.  Susan and I spoke this morning and after you
receive the fed ex package and turn them over to her, she and I will proceed
from there. We both have copies of our checklist.

Thanks - Maria

Adele and Maria:
Here are my final comments:

1.   In the ISDA Schedule, Part 4, Section (f)(iii), we cannot accept a 30
day
waiting period.  Why can't the Guaranty be furnished when the Reorg becomes
effective?

2.   In each Guaranty, there is an extra zero in the "cap" amount.

3.   In the PSE&G Guaranty, the Counterparty notice section should be just
like
what is in the Master for primary notices and copies.

4.   In the LC, in the new language on the second page, change Uniform
Customs
to UCP.

That's all I have.  Subject to resolving point #1, please e-mail to me the
Enron
Guaranty and please coordinate with Susan Flynn on getting final versions
executed and obtaining other closing items.  I will review your opinion
shortly.

We are trying to finalize the agreement that does the following:

1. Transfers all of the ENA/Oneok Gas Marketing Company trades and the Oneok 
Gas Marketing Master from Onoek Gas Marketing Company to 
Oneok Energy Marketing and Trading Company, L.P. (formerly KN Marketing LP);
2. Terminates the Oneok Energy Marketing Master and makes all Oneok Energy 
and Oneok Gas Marketing trades subject to the Onoek Gas Marketing Master.

Here is what I need to know from you:

1. Is there a new Oneok Inc. Guaranty for $30,000,000 that covers these 
trades?  If so, please fax me a copy.

2. Is there a new Enron Guaranty and if not, what happens to the 2 existing 
Enron Guarantees that currently support the Onoek Energy Master and the Oneok 
Gas Marketing Master?

Please advise.

I'm pretty flexible.  The only days that appear to be bad if its done during 
lunch would be Friday, June 2 and Friday, June 16th.  As for ideas, I have 
NOTHING right now, but i know that Julia has some used stuff that she is 
going to give me.  We are planning on buying the furniture before the end of 
May.  As for the rest, I really hope to have all of that bought before the 
middle of June just in case.

Fabulous news!!!!!!!!!!!   Julia just called and they are wanting to do a 
baby shower for you.  I told her that I thought you needed to pick the date 
since you have so much going on.  Just thought I'd give you the heads up so 
you can be thinking of a date.  We would do it up here.  You also need to be 
thinking about what you need because people are going to be asking!

I'm so excited about the baby!!!!!!  We had a great time!!!!!

Welcome back!  How was your trip?  Stop by when you get a chance or we can 
talk about it tomorrow at lunch.  We got great news yesterday - the placenta 
is gradually moving to the right place and it appears as if I am out of the 
"danger" zone.  The baby is in the right position now and is a little over 4 
pounds so I am very, very happy and relieved.  Your good vibes are working.  
I'll see my other doctor on Thursday and confirm everything with him but if 
Ric sees me now on the treadmill at the club, tell him not to worry!  (Just 
kidding - I'm not sure I could run now even if I wanted to).  talk to you 
soon.

P.S. - How can I find out about where I stand currently re unused vacation 
time?

Mark, Kristina, and Carol,

In the past few months (before Carol went on maturity leave) I have been 
communicating with Carol on possible positions available at Enron.  Due to 
the Moratorium that was in place here at Azurix, unfortunately, I could not 
speak to anyone at Enron in reference to possible employment opportunities.  
The Azurix Board has lifted the moratorium as of August 7, 2000 and due to 
the present situation here at Azurix, I would greatly appreciate the 
opportunity to speak to each of you of any positions that are open in your 
area or of possible leads to other groups that can use a candidate who is 
detail oriented and possess strong analytical,  communication and 
interpersonal skills and proficient when it comes to ethical and professional 
responsibilities within the corporate arena.  

Thank you for reviewing my resume and I hope to be speaking to each of you in 
the future.  Many thanks, Barb

Here is where things stand on Engage:

1.  Engage Energy US LP - Luke and I have agreed on the new draft of 
amendment.   The Credit Support Provider will be Coastal.  Luke is sending me 
their form of Guaranty which I will take a look at.  It will cover just the 
Engage Energy US financial transactions and have a cap of $10,000,000 

2. Engage Energy Canada LP - It will stay as currently written although the 
Guaranty from Westcoast will have now a cap of $10,000,000 and only cover the 
Engage Canada financial transactions.

I need to make some minor chnages to the Engage US amendment and then it will 
be ready and you can coordinate with Luke in getting it executed.

Hello Parents!

Camp is about to begin!  Are you ready?  Well, we are, and we're excited 
about it!!!  Here are some details that will hopefully answer any questions 
you might have about your child's experience in Enron's Kidventure summer 
camp.

Camp officially begins each morning between 7:30 a.m. and 8 a.m.   You must 
bring your child to the Energizer private dining room by 8 a.m. (at the 
latest) each morning.  You do not need visitor badges for your children.  
Enron security is fully aware that you will be bringing your children in each 
morning.  We will have five dedicated Enron security guards helping us with 
the camp each day to ensure your child's safety while in the building.    
When going from the Energizer to the bus, your children will ride a dedicated 
elevator escorted by an Enron security guard.  Kidventure camp counselors 
will be active with your children as soon as you drop them off in the morning 
until the bus leaves at 8:15 a.m.   Your children will return to Enron at 4 
p.m. each afternoon, and will continue their Enron-site activities until you 
pick them up between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m.  All children MUST be picked up by 5 
p.m.   A fee of $1 per minute after 5 p.m will be charged.

At the beginning of each week of camp, you will pay the remainder of your 
balance to Kidventure Camps.  Your children will also receive their official 
camp t-shirt on the first day of camp.  You may purchase additional t-shirts 
for $10.00 each.  Each child will also make a name tag on their first day 
which they will use for their camp term.  

Also, if you have not sent in your liability release forms, I must have them 
by tomorrow. Thanks!

Hopefully I have answered all of your questions, if not, please call me at 
x37514 or e-mail me.
Thank you and have a great summer! 

Michelle

Jeff:
Just a few comments:

1. In the definition of termination Event, I think that the words "due to" 
need to be put after the word "means" in the first line.

2. In Section 3.4(a), I noticed that the bracketed langugae "as it relates to 
the Assigned Interest" has now been deleted.  Pursuant to my earlier comment 
on this, what this maens to me is that with respect to the Fixed Payment 
piece of this, we can never terminate the swap based on something that 
happens to Pelican .  Is that the way it is supposed to work?  If so, plaese 
explain why.

3. With respect to the lnagugae in Section 3.6(a), instead of saying in the 
first sentence of such Section "the amount determined..." shouldn't it say 
"the fair market value of Party A's remaining payment obligations under the 
Transaction".  Section 2(x) of the confirm just refers to Disputed Matters 
and it is not claer to me what is in dispute when an Event of Default or 
Termination Event occurs and what amount Party A has to pay when these events 
occur.  What is the priocedure for coming up with this amount?  Does each 
party calculate it and then send it to the experts or do the experts just 
determine it?

I attach a revised draft of the Policy marked to show changes from the draft

Exhibit 2 is not yet sufficiently specific to carry the weight it is asked
to carry in the Policy.  So far as I am aware, we have not yet seen a
revised Exhibit 1.

I will draft something in the form of a disclaimer and send it to you.  Is 
this something that we are just doing for this customer or will this happen 
more frequently with other customers?

		 Subject: ACE-Enron Waiver Letter


Carol:  I apologize for being deliquent in getting you a draft of a waiver 
letter for our representation of ENA in the ACE insurance transaction, but I 
have had an incredibly hectic two weeks.  This draft is virtually the same as 
the other waiver letters I have prepared for ENA over the years, with the 
notable exception of the acknowledgement that certain LLGM lawyers can review 
the insurance status of the policy for ACE from an insurance status 
standpoint.  As you know, I was not particularly thrilled about having us 
perform that role, but I understand that this issue was vented in 
considerable detail a week or so ago and agreed to by both parties.  Please 
let me know if this letter is acceptable to you.  If it is, perhaps you could 
just reply to this e-mail and I can then forward an original to you via fax 
for your signature.  If you have any questions, please call me.  Thanks very 
much for your time and consideration in this respect.  And, thanks for 
providing us  with the opportunity to work with you on this project.

John

Carol, I'd like to speak with you regarding the following structure proposed 
by Sorema, which address the fact that they can't sell/buy derivatives and 
can't reinsure any contract governed by NY law.  The credit issue 
remains--they propose solving it by means of an assignment clause.

Sorema did six deals with us last year using Palladium.

We can accept your comment regarding resolving conflicts between executed

Just a reminder that we need to discuss matters relating to Occidental (their 
proposed change to the MAC language) and Chautauqua Airlines.  Alos, with 
respect to Aquila/Utilicorp,  apparently they cannot have all of the online 
paperwork completed until next Tuesday.  They submitted a PA today but the 
guy that needs to authorize the sub-user accounts is not in the office until 
Tuesday.  The current plan would be for them to do that on Tuesday and then 
to make the switch from Aquila to Utilicorp effective next Wednesday.  I'll 
keep you posted but we still have not declared the Utilicorp ISDA effective.

Were the following points considered or discussed prior to them turning the 
last draft?  The cross default langugae still does not work.  Why was the 
threshold lowered to $50,000,000?

What are your thoughts on this?

Subject: Swap Assignment Agreement - April 20 Draft

Jeff:
Sorry this took so long but here are my thoughts on the above:

1. In Section 3.1 (c), I'm assuming that the additional sections were added 
because we will get these reps in another agreement from the Trust.  Is that 
correct?

2. In Section 3.4 e), the new language regarding rescission of acceleration I 
think belongs after the phrase that begins, "if the effect of such 
failure..."  Also, where did the new language regarding prepayments at the 
end come from?  Is this in the Revolver or in Enron's existing deals? 

3. Section 3.11 should be made subject to Section 5.7 or vice versa.

Carol

Russell:
Based on my review of the 6/23 draft of ISDA Schedule here are my credit 
questions:

1. There is no Credit Support Provider for Equitable.  Should there be?

2. What should the cross default thresholds be and who should they apply to?

3. Are you satisfied with the Additional Termination Event?    I'm assuming 
that in clause (i) of the definition of Debt Coverage Amount, it makes sense 
to take "future" revenues from the preceding year and subtract from it asset 
sales made during the current year?  How will we know what assets sales are 
made?  Will the future net revenue calculation be shown on the reserve report 
that we receive annually?  When will this calculation be done?  Are you 
satisfied with their definition of Internal and External debt?

4. In Part 3(a), looks like we would only receive an annual reserve report.  
Is that sufficient?  When should we get it?  Alos, whose financials do you 
want to receive?

5. In Part 5(c) - Setoff, I'll just note that this only applies to amounts 
due and owing between the parties and does not include "affiliates".  

6. In Part 5(f)- Assignment,  we need to decide what conditions precedent we 
want to apply to the limited partnership entity that they assign it to given 
the fact that once assigned, we will have no recourse to the partners, even 
the GP.  For example, should the LP have a minimum asset value at the time of 
the transfer?  It is not clear to me what assets this LP would own at the 
time of the transfer and I'm assuming that we would want it to meet some 
minimum credit criteria prior to such transfer.  In addition, are you 
satisfied with the debt and asset sale limitations?  On asset sales, I think 
that they need an annual limit as it is not clear to me how the $2,000,000 
limit currently works.  Alos, I think that all of these limitations in 
Section (f) should either be additional Events of Default or Additional 
termination Events.

Please call when ready to discuss.

Carol

possible for you and I to get together 1 more time for lunch before I leave?  
How does the week of July 10th look?

Carol,

It looks like we may have to change the Houston terminations phone number. 
Can you tell me how many customers will be affected?

I will forward a new number once known (probably later this week). Will Tana 
be handling the change notification?

Subject: Update on Duke Energy

We currently have the following outstanding confirmations with Duke:

1. Duke Energy Marketing Ltd. Partnership (Canada)    601 confirmations

We were delayed in calling this c/p because ECC was forwarding an 'approved'
list of c/p for us to contact. Duke is on the 'approved' list.

I faxed a list of outstanding confirms to Manolo recently, and am calling him 
today to follow-up.
Manolo Martinez may be contacted at 403-297-9889.

2. Duke Energy Trading and Marketing (Houston) 321 confirmations

Theresa Copeland has been my contact at 713-260-8540.
In late 99/early 00, she said that an arrangement was made with Diane Swiber 
whereby Duke didn't need to sign or send confirmations back to us, but the 321
above represents financial deals only.

Theresa said that if there are any discrepancies with any confirmations, that 
Duke is able
to mark any changes on the confirmations, and fax these back to us within 48 
hours,

If you would, briefly discuss your history with Duke, 

David

expect many other products to appeal to their customers, the EnronOnline 
people will expect all products listed online to be available unless we can

Carol,

I've been working with Jaime Williams and our outside tax advisors to 
determine the Mexican tax consequences applicable to those products that 
Jaime has informed me will be offered to Mexican counterparties through 
EnronOnLine and, potentially, a separate ENA Mexican entity.  I should be 
able to provide the results by Friday or Monday.  Please contact me at ext. 
35777 if you'd like to discuss in the meantime.

Best regards,

Jeff

As I think you are aware, the Meixco and online group want to implement 
online trading for Mexican counterparties.  Are there any tax issues taht we 
should be aware of?  If we conduct online trades using ENA and telephone 
trades with an Enron Mexican entity, will the exercise of setoff rights 
create any tax issues?   My understanding is that the Enron counterparty will 
be ENA.

the language that we currently have in the Schedule which they would not

Thanks again for your help.  I just think that at this point it is easier for

I am faxing to you our comments to the latest drafts of Schedules.  Our 
credit person has agreed to make the MAC trigger as an additional Termination 
Event so long as (1) we limit the trigger to the S&P rating; (2) we provide a 
cure concept that the non-Affected Party controls subject to a cap; and (3) 
we remove the MAC trigger from the collateral threshold definition.  I have 
included some proposed language.  Also, with respect to the partnership 
agreement, I seem to recall that you were reluctant to send us a copy as we 
traditionally review LP agreements as a part of our due diligence.  Is that 
still the case?  I like what you did on the Termination Event but we need 
some comfort that you cannot alter or narrow the GP's liability that is 
provided by statute.  Could you please give that some thought and we can talk 
further about it?

Tomorrow is bad for me to talk but the rest of the week after tomorrow looks 
good if you have some time.

 John Hancock is insisting that we resurrect the termination for
illegality provision from the Master and put it in the Swap assignment
agreement as an option for the Trust to terminate the Swap and trigger an
appraisal if there is an illegality event.  Does Enron have an institutional
problem with this if the commercial and legal people are comfortable with it
here in London?

Hi Carol. I'm really thrilled for you. How long do you plan to stay out?

 Scott and Andrea are having a baby! So I'll be a grandmother in

 How about June 5 - 8 any day for lunch?  Pam

We thought that it would be a good idea to meet with the "weather" group to 
introduce ourselves and alos to go over some of the basics, such as 
procedures for getting confidentiality agreements processed etc.  Could you 
send me a list of who you think we should include in this meeting and Sara 
and I will do the rest?  Will a lunch work?

Carol:

I'd rather not change our standard agreement.  Specifically, the current 
definition of "Indemnifiable Tax" covers both present and future tax (as 
evidenced in the definition "Tax") and thus, necessarily, should protect the 
counterparty in the case of a "Change in Tax Law."  Moreover, Deutsche Bank's 
amendment to "Indemnifiable Tax" potentially subjects us to risk that I don't 
feel is in our best interest to assume because we don't have any control over 
the counterparty's activities.  Bottom line - I would reject the amendment.

Please let me know if you would like me to speak to their tax counsel.

Subject: ISDA Tax Issue

Rhett:
You may recall a few weeks ago I asked you about some language that one of 
our counterparties wanted as an amendment to the term "Indemnifiable Tax".  
Another counterparty, Deutsche Bank, has requested the following which I 
think is very similar to what we were looking at before:

Notwithstanding the foregoing, "IndemnifiableTax" also means any Tax imposed 
by reasons of a Change in Tax Law by a government or taxing authority of a 
Relevant Jurisdiction of the payer, unless the payee is incorporated, 
organized, managed and controlled or considered to have its seat in such 
jurisdiction, or is acting for purposes of this Agreement through a branch or 
office located in such jurisdiction.

In the ISDA Users' guide, they explain that the effect of this language is to 
eliminate the payee's risk of bearing new taxes imposed by the payer's 
jurisdiction even if the payee's activities in such jurisdiction is the basis 
for such taxes. (except if the circumstances in the definition occur).    It 
thus results in the payer having to gross up for such taxes.

Do you think that we can or should accept this?

Gareth & Carol,

Attached are the term sheets associated with a proposal from Citibank in 
response to our desire to set up a revolving type facility to execute 
short-dated crude oil prepays (i.e. 180 day financially settled prepays) in 
order to minimize execution costs.  I will call to set up a meeting to fill 
you in on the details but there is a high probability that we will need to 
finalize and close by the end of this month.

Jack:
I will send you an open issues list shortly.  I considered items # 2,3,4,6, 
9, 12, 17, 18, 19 and 21 to be credit-related comments, some of which I need 
my credit person's input on.  As to the remaining points, here is my response:

1. Let's discuss exactly what language you want in item #1 as I agree with 
you on the concept.

2. With respect to item #7,  your interpretation is correct.

3. I am not clear on what your point is in items #9 and 21.  As a general 
rule, with respect to setoff rights, to the extent that ENA is the 
Non-Defaulting Party and ENA's affiliates have entered into other agreements 
with Inland Paperboard and Packaging, amounts owed under those affiliate 
agreements can be setoff against amounts owed under the ISDA.  All the 
guaranty is trying to say is that the amount guaranteed under the Guaranty 
takes into account the exercise of such setoff rights.

4. I'm not sure I understand your point #10.

5. I agree with your point #13.

6. With respect to point #14, collateral is limited to cash and LC's and the 
concept of a custodial account applies when someone other than the Secured 
Party is holding  the cash collateral.

7. With respect to point #19, we want the ability to convert the LC into cash 
collateral when an Event of Default occurs even if we have not yet terminated 
all transactions.  Once we have terminated and established a termination 
amount, we would only draw to cover that amount if we didn't draw earlier.

8. The "deemed occurrence" language  is meant to cover termination events 
that occur automatically without either party electing to terminate, such as 
in a bankruptcy scenario where automatic early termination is elected.  We 
could probably take it out since there is no automatic early termination on 
bankruptcy.

I look forward to hearing from you.  My credit person is out this week, but 
maybe you and I can make some progress.

Hi Carol -
Sorry for the delay.  The "credit person" at Inland is probably Julie Beck,
although she can naturally be overruled by the Temple-Inland Treasurer, Dave
Turpin, or CFO Randy Levy, since Temple-Inland will be obtaining the letter
of credit and will serve as guarantor.  Since they are at least one step
removed from the process, if you could tell me what questions/comments from
my 5/16 memo they will need to address, and ideally your
responses/commentary in some summary format, I can upstream this information
to them, obtain their feedback, and speak on their behalf.
Thanx,
Jack Falconi

Please find attached for your review, a Consent to Assignment Agreement
between us, Enron Power Marketing, Inc. and Morgan Stanley Capital Group
Inc.  We would like to have the document ready to execute at about the same
time we execute the derivatives Consent to Assignment Agreement with Enron
North America, and we are waiting for FERC approval on the Physical Power
Sales as well.  I just wanted to present the agreement to you now, so that
if it is necessary, we have time to discuss any concerns.  I look forward to
talking with you to work toward the execution of the Agreement.

Tana,

Before Carol St. Clair left for maternity leave, she was working on the 
assignment of some financial and gas deals with Christopher Smith (who 
previously worked in our group).  Since Christopher is no longer here and 
with Carol being out, I'm scrambling to find out who in the financial team is 
working on this.

I've left Mark Taylor a message since Carol's voice mail forwards all 
questions to Mark.

Could you let me know if you have any info?

Thx,
Tracyh

Hey Greg.  I see no objection to amending the ISDA to cover power 
transactions.  Also,  potential credit exposure related to a prompt month 
power trade should be modest.  You may want to ensure that Tracy has no 
objection, but this transaction should be fine.

Rod:

We are looking at doing a June physical index power purchase today with 
Kaiser. however, Kaiser only wants to proceed if we can assure them that we 
can add electricity to the existing ISDA between Enron and Kaiser such that 
they could fix the price during the month of June. After reading your comment 
below about netting it appears that a longer term transaction would not be 
advisable until further legal clarification occurs. Is there any reason we 
can't or shouldn't pursue adding electricity to the ISDA provided we only do 
one month transactions (assuming we see no risk of near term bankrupcty)? 
Please advise immediately.

Tracy,

Did you have a chance to read my email response earlier this week?  I believe 
that it is highly unlikely that we will be able to net exposures across 
non-defaulting (Enron) entities.  Paul Simons can (and maybe has by now) 
given opinion to this idea.  Historically, I believe the opinion has long 
been that such netting (set-off against affiliates of non-defaulting party) 
in the US should work within the case of contractual default, but outside of 
bankruptcy.  However, in the special case of legal bankruptcy, such netting 
(though contractually agreed by the parties) may be challenged.  Introducing 
the fact that one of Enron's entities is a UK entity may further cloud the 
likelihood.  Clearly, if the relationship involves more than on Kaiser 
entity, netting almost certainly will not work.

Has Diana not responded to your credit exposure questions regarding the form 
of governing confirmation and legal entity?  I believe that she is in the US, 
but should be checking in.  Perhaps you should try calling her?  I think we 
will find that the transacting entity is a subsidiary of Kaiser Aluminum.

Risk management systems for metals are still not ideal.  Volumetric/CVAR type 
analysis may not yield such reliable results.

Subject: Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corporation - UK and US swaps
Importance: High

Rod,

Enron North America is looking to enter into power swaps with Kaiser Aluminum 
& Chemical Corporation starting June 2001.  I'm seeing in the credit system 
that MG plc has forward financial metals positions with Kaiser, however I 
need clarification on whether the swaps are done with Kaiser Aluminum & 
Chemical Corporation or Kaiser Aluminum International Inc.  Secondly, is 
there a Master ISDA Agreement governing those swaps?  In pulling the mtm 
monthly breakout, it appears that MG plc is OTM north of $10MM US and the 
liquidation of that portfolio occurs mostly in cal '02.

Given Kaiser's limited credit line, I'd like to look into the potential of 
setting off financial exposures in the UK and US in cases of default.  Kaiser 
is looking at other businesses with Enron and this could be quite fruitful to 
tap into in order to increase trading liquidity going forward.

In summary, we need to answer at minimum the following:
? confirmation of which Kaiser entity is financial transacting with MG plc
? volatility of the metal positions that go out to Jan '04 to ensure how 
quickly this out-of-the-money position can move
? what type of paper is confirming the swaps (whether long-form confirms or 
Master ISDA)
? what credit/legal terms and laws may affect our efforts to establish a 
Netting Agreement for UK and US financial

Can you help me in coordinating a meeting with London legal/credit and 
Portland credit/Houston legal to discuss pertinent issues associated with a 
Netting Agreement between Kaiser (single entity or multiple entities) and 
Enron entities (MG plc and ENA) as soon as possible.  Please let me know your 
thoughts to the above and who we need to contact to get the above points 
addressed.  In Houston legal, Carol St. Clair is available to work on the 
drafting of such a Netting Agreement and is speaking with Sara Shackleton 
about the concept as well.

Please let me know as soon as possible your comments to the above and in 
setting up a conference call to push this forward.

Thanks,
Tracy

Carol,

I had hoped all was well with the First Amendment with TransCanada; however, 
they are now requested certain changes.  Therefore, I am forwarding this 
message onto you for your review and comments.

Just let me know what is decided so that execution copies can be generated.

Susan:

My apologies in advance for causing you more work!

Although TransCanada previously consented to the format of amendment proposed
by Enron, upon closer review of this document, there are certain changes
requires by TransCanada, prior to execution.

E.4.(a) - TEFP will not agree to this point.  Will Enron consider not 
including
this language in the amendment?

E.4.(b) - please redraft, so that a Letter of Credit (L/C) may be drawn upon 
in
the event of default, only if the L/C holder is owed money.

E.4.(c) - why does Enron want this change?

F. - please redraft so that an L/C may be drawn upon if there is an event of
default, only up to an amount equal to the exposure amount.  Also please 
remove
all references to 'transferable' throughout the L/C.

Thank you for your assistance.  Again, I am sorry to have reneged on our
agreement.

Karen

trigger to be based only on either a drop in the S&P rating or a failure to 
have an S&P rating.  In addition, Brant has advised me that should we put in 
place a CSA, that the following would be the credit matrix for collateral 
threshold:

BB to BB+  $2,500,000
Below BB  Zero

Subject: Weather Confirmation

Attached is the Aquila/ENA weather HDD confirmation. A couple of points to 
note.

The Aquila company listed on the Confirmation is the one having an ISDA with 
Enron. I'm not sure if ENA is the Enron counterparty.
If we elect we can put a specific payment date in or just leave it to as 20 
Business Days after the Floating Amount is detetmined.
If there is an Aquila/ENA ISDA then that should be referenced  in Paragraph 1.


Will you pass it on

Rod:
Here are their credit issues:

1. In the cross-default language that want to add language that basically 
says that even if a cross-default occurs, unless the Non-Defaulting 
determines in good faith that performance by the Defaulting Party of its 
obligations under the Master is "endangered", then no cross default is 
triggered.

2. In Credit Event Upon Merger we had commented that instaed of the 
"materially weaker" standard we wanted to specify that it meant being rated 
below BBB- by S&P.  Do you feel strongly about this?  Alos, we usually have 
language that says that if an event like merger occurs and the transferee 
provides collateral to the other party in an amount that is satisfactory to 
such party, then a Credit Event Upon Merger is not triggered.  They did not 
want to add this carve-out.  Are you okay with this?

3. They want a separate Event of Default that gets triggered if a MAC (below 
BBB-) occurs.  We requested that it be out in the collateral threshold 
language.

4. They are saying that for "operational" purposes, they cannot agree to 
"netting".

5. They want as a category of Eligible Collateral governmental securities 
with a maturity of less than 1 year, valued at 98%.

6. In the CSA, if a dispute occurs with respect to either the calculation of 
Exposure or the calculation of the value of any colateral in connection with 
a party's request either for the transfer or return of collateral, normally 
the following procedures apply:

a. the disputing party notifies the other party of the nature of the dispute 
by the close of business on the day following the day that the collateral 
request was made.

b. the undisputed amount is transferred to the party making the request

c. the parties attempt to resolve the dispute by the "Resolution Time" and if 
a resolution is not reached, a recalculation of the Exposure is made and 
market quotations have to be obtained.

We normally say that the Resolution Time is 3 Business Days after the dispute 
notice is given.  DB wants to shorten this period to 1 Business Day after the 
dispute notice is given which gives the parties less time to resolve the 
dispute on their own.  What do you think?

7. If a party holds cash as collateral, we normally say that interest earned 
is transferred on the first day of the month.  They want to change first to 
last.

Let me know what you think.  I was hoping that some of these you could 
resolve with your counterpart at DB.

On the list for 6/6/00, NRG Energy Inc. was previously not approved for 
physical power trading and we are not opening them up at this time.  Per my 
discussions with Credit, they are coming thru as an amendment to open them up 
for US power and emissions.  This counterparty is not showing up on the FERC 
approved marketers list, and Leslie Hansen is contacting the counterparty to 
determine what records they have, if any, that show they have been approved 
by the FERC to trade power.  Until we are provided that info, we cannot open 
them up for power.  US emissions has been opened. 





P.S.  If Utilicorp. need to be approved when I am out Monday and Tuesday, 
talk to Carol St. Clair, the attorney working on the ISDA Master, or Susan 
Bailey, the paralegal  working on the contract.

Jeff:
Here is what we are doing today with respect to the revised form of Annex A:

1. Marie sent to Bob Bowen yesterday the new forms of Annex A for ENA and ECC 
and it is my understanding that as of today, these forms will be used for all 
new Omnibus Counterparties.

2. Last week, Mary provided us with a list of new Omnibus Counterparties for 
the month of March and with the exception of the Canadian counterparties, we 
are in the process of faxing the Annex A letter which gives them until the 
end of April to respond.  With respect to the Canadian counterparties we are 
waiting to hear back from Derek before we send them the letter.

3. We need to receive from Mary a list of any additional new Omnibus 
Counterparties, if any, that have done trades with us since the date of the 
list that she gave us last week so that we can include them in the mail-out.  
It is my understanding that Mary will leave Marie Heard a voice mail about 
this today so that we can make arrangements for the letters to be sent to 
those counterparties.  Hopefully, that group will be small.

4. The plan is to roll out the new Annex A's to everyone beginning on May 1.  
I will update the Special Handlings List to include those counterparties that 
have requested special exceptions that we are okay with.

I will be at the Enron legal conference the rest of the week but will be 
checking voice mail.

Please find attached clean and black-lined versions of the Swap Confirmation, 
Swap Assignment Agreement and Calculation Agency Agreement.

Please note that in the Swap Confirmation, items relating to the Sarlux 
Indexation Adjustment, forms of Calculation Agent Certificate and Independent 
Engineers Certificate and Schedule 4 (Projected Adjustments) still require 
completion.? We would therefore welcome the suggestions of the working group 
in order to finalise these outstanding items.? We currently plan to circulate 
revised drafts of the Swap documents on Monday to the Equity,? which will 
incorporate comments we receive from the group by Monday am (London time).

You will note that the $ amount for the Trakya Forced Outage Adjustment has 
been changed to $911,000 (from $910,000).? This reflects the most up to date 
figures sent to us from Jeff Ball at DLJ.

Bill:
Thanks for the information.  I need to take a closer look at Janet's
language, particularly the "null and void" language to make sure that it
covers all possible events of default under the Master Agreement.  As to
the Texas law issue, our ability to get comfortable from a legal standpoint
will in large part be dictated by this issue.  Is there anyway to get more
certainty on this with the sureties?  I understand that you don't want to
go to them multiple times but this is a key issue for us.  Let me know what
you think.

In my opinion, the wording suggested by Janet Green should be acceptable.
We
will have to have this wording formally approved by the surety companies
prior
to issuance.  I would like to avoid approaching the sureties until all
questions
have been addressed and all changes have been made.  In regards the bonds
being
subject to Texas law, I do not see that as being a problem.  We will
address
that with the sureties along with other potential changes.

In response to previous email, neither Dan nor I know of an attorney that
would
be willing or able to write an opinion in regards the applicability of the
Appleton Law.  As discussed during the meeting, this law has nothing to do
with
the viability of an exisitng surety bond.  If a surety issued a bond that
was
later found to be in violation of Appleton, they would be fined by the
State of
New York.  It does not make the bond invalid.  MJH

What if we said:  "if the
Principal shall promptly and faithfully perform its obligations under the
Confirm, which is a part of and governed by the Master Agreement, then this
obligation shall be null and void"

With respect to her second point, what if we again said "an Event of
Default has occurred under the Confirm, which is a part of and governed by
the Master Agreement"?

I think she is trying to clarify in the language that the bond can be
called for an Event of Default under the Master Agreement, which could have
nothing to do with the Confirm - - - which is factually correct.

Carol:

Thankyou for the attached.  I believe the governing law for each issuing
surety will be the law where the surety is domiciled, but let me do some
checking and confirm this.  Also, will get back to you on your comments Re
the language in our recommended bond form...probably Monday or Tuesday next
week.  Thanks for your continued efforts in this matter.

Bill:
I spoke with our outside counsel yesterday and we have some more follow up
work that we need to do on our side.  One issue that may be of some
importance to us in our analysis is determining what the governing law of
the surety bond will be for each issuer, and more importantly, whether we
can have the bonds governed by Texas law.  Can you answer this for me?

Also, with respect to the form of the bond itself, as we mentioned at the
meeting, the language in the third paragraph which states that "if the
Principal shall promptly and faithfully provide the Firm energy as defined
in the Confirm, hen this obligation shall be null and void," does not work
for us.  Has anyone come up with alternative language?  Finally, with
respect to the Notice of Claim, we would like for the certification to say
something like, "an Event of Default has occurred under the Master
Agreement" rather than tie it to a specific default under the Confirmation.
Does that work for the sureties?

I look forward to hearing from you.

I thought that it would be easier to e-mail you since we keep missing each 
other on the phone.  All of the St. Clair's are doing well.  Charles keeps 
growing.  At his last visit last week he was 11 1/2 pounds and 22 inches.  
Needless to say he likes to eat.  He is gradually starting to sleep more at 
night but is still pretty unpredictable and I've just gotten used to not 
getting alot of sleep.  Having Bill home with me is a big help and it makes 
it alot easier for me since we can trade off.

Physically, I am feeling almost 100%.  I started running a few weeks ago just 
to keep my sanity and have started playing tennis again although it is going 
to take a long time for me to get back into playing shape.  Arthur is very 
much into tennis and I am enjoying getting to watch him play.  He played in 
his first tournament over the weekend and did very well.  Bill and I are 
hoping that he keeps it up.  He has been great with the baby as I expected.  
He is a calming influence on him and really interacts well with him.  I feel 
very, very fortunate.

How are you doing and how are the boys?  I miss work and the interaction with 
everyone, but at the same time I am enjoying my time at home.  I think that 
you know how I must feel and I'm glad that I still have some time to think 
about it.  I can't imagine having to go back after 6 weeks as I am just 
beginning to feel good physically.  Carol St. Clair

Arthur is back in school and is a big help at home.  I'm enjoying being home 
with him when he gets home from school and its nice to be able to visit him 
while he is in school.

I hope that you are doing well and not killing yourself up there.  How are 
your parents doing?  Please give them my best.  I keep promising to come up 
for a visit and I will soon.  Tomorrow (Thursday) may be a possibility.  Hope 
to see you soon.  Take care.

Carol

Carol,

I need to fill you in on the new structure. Essentially the senior debt will 
now be Corp guaranteed and on balance sheet. The swap adjustments will 
therefore impact equity only.

We are now projecting financial close as the week of June 19th - the week I 
go on holiday!. That means preliminary offering memo for the guaranteed notes 
going out around the last week of May. By then, everything has to be 
finalised (including the swap).

Hope this helps your planning. 

All is well and will be better when Margaux closes. 

All the best with being a mum again!

Can you give me a sense of when you think Margaux will close?  The only

I get someone else involved.  Hope all is going well.

Bill:  Attached is a revised draft of the Agreements for our telephone
conversation tomorrow at 4:00 p.m.  This incorporates the changes from our
last discussion. David, Ed and I have reviewed the proposed changes, but
have only briefly discussed the current version among ourselves.  As a
result, we may have a few other items to discuss that are not noted on the
documents.  We look forward to the call.  Best regards.  Rick.

We are still discussing internally the time period that should be specified 
in the definition of Credit Support Provider.  We are not comfortable with 
specifying October 2002 as the date.  What is the reason for this?  We are 
trying to make this language as transaction specific as possible.  Is there 
anything else that we can add to it to make it more precise?  Please call me 
in the morning.  I'm in by 8:30.  Thanks.

Thanks for your quick response.  As for me, I've got about 3 weeks to go and 
after this week, pretty much anything goes.  I feel great and am really 
excited and anxious.  In the meantime, I'm using my pregnancy as an excuse to 
get our counterparties to finalize our ISDA's and it appears to be working!  
Thanks for asking.

We are trying to finalize our ISDA with Deutsche Bank.  In the Guaranty where 
we have the setoff and counterclaim language they want to add a proviso that 
basically states that Enron Corp. would be entitled to get the benefit of the 
rights, setoffs, counterclaims and other defenses that ENA is entitled to 
only to the extent taht it would have had the benefit of those rights if it 
were the direct counterparty.  I think that I am okay with this but wanted 
your input.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks.

We are trying to finalize the agreement that does the following:

1. Transfers all of the ENA/Oneok Gas Marketing Company trades and the Oneok 
Gas Marketing Master from Onoek Gas Marketing Company to 
Oneok Energy Marketing and Trading Company, L.P. (formerly KN Marketing LP);
2. Terminates the Oneok Energy Marketing Master and makes all Oneok Energy 
and Oneok Gas Marketing trades subject to the Onoek Gas Marketing Master.

Here is what I need to know from you:

1. Is there a new Oneok Inc. Guaranty for $30,000,000 that covers these 
trades?  If so, please fax me a copy.

2. Is there a new Enron Guaranty and if not, what happens to the 2 existing 
Enron Guarantees that currently support the Onoek Energy Master and the Oneok 
Gas Marketing Master?

Please advise.

I spoke with the contact that you left me last week and she indicated that 
the ISDA had not yet been signed but that in all likelihood it would be 
signed in a few days.  I asked Susan bailey to send you the certificate with 
resolutions that you requested along with a new draft of the Transfer 
Agreement which has a blank for the date.  My thought was that everything 
would become effective on the date that we insert in the Transfer Agreement 
and I would ask that you coordinate with Susan bailey when you know what that 
date will be so that we can make sure that our systems reflect when the 
trades are to be confirmed under the Utilicorp Master.  Thanks.

provisions. I think the other changes in the draft are generally ok or need
a little clarification, e.g. I don't see the relevance of adding Part 6(g)
and (h) as we don't trade in pulp or paper. Please let me know if we need to
discuss. Thanks. Henry. (412-553-7711)

Enclosed are clean and marked revised drafts of the Schedules.  As we
discussed,
I have bracketed those sections that are still open.  Please note that since
May, 2000 when the initial draft was sent to you we have updated our forms
and I
have included our new form language in Part 3, Sections (a) and (b), part 6,
Sections (g) and (h), Paragraph 13 (g) and the LC form.  Alos, I have made
the
chnages that you requested to the Enron Guaranty.  Are those chnages also
acceptable for the ERI Guaranty?

I look forward to hearing from you.  I will be leaving to go on maternity
leave
at the end of this week.  In my absence, please contact Susan Bailey at
713-853-4737 who will coordinate with another attorney in our group to get
this
finalized.

I understand there is an email out, which I haven't received, telling us that 
the people will be moving back into their offices tomorrow.  The next phase 
will start next week.  People have to be out of their offices by August 
23rd.  That'll work out perfectly!  I'll have you packed up and hopefully 
somewhere to put everything.  I've ordered boxes and packing bubbles for your 
photographs.  Anyway, I'm sure you'll get a memo.  He must have put it on the 
slowest possible method of getting to us.

Jim Grace came in yesterday, but I didn't say anything to him.  Dan, of 
course, had to say "how's it going" or something like that.  

Everything is fine here I guess.  I can't think of anything to report.  How 
are you doing?

Paul Henry on the weather desk informed me that they have agreed with one of 
our counterparties to terminate a deal.  I've asked for a copy of the 
confirm.  Could one of you please e-mail to me this morning a form of dela 
termination letter that we can send to the counterparty?  Thanks.

Jack:
Enclosed is a new draft of the Schedules marked against the previous draft.  
I believe that this draft responds to most of the issues raised in your 
e-mails.  Just a few additional thoughts:

1. Since we will be redoing all of the existing confirms to refer to this 
Master, I did not change the language that states that conflicts between the 
Confirms and the Agreement are resolved in favor of the Confirm.  I think 
that the language as written works.

2. On the setoff language, when we are the Non-Defaulting Party, we can only 
pull in other agreements between our affiliates and inland so I don't see how 
this language would impact any agreements between ENA and guaranty Bank 
unless Inland is the Non-Defaulting party.

3. With respect to Disruption Fallbacks, our view is that if the Confirm 
specifies a Fallback reference Price that after Postponement, you would use 
that price if available.  I think that the language works as drafted.

4. On cash collateral, the Qualified institution concept only applies when 
the non-posting party is a Defaulting party or has a Credit rating below the 
threshold.  Otherwise the non-posting party can hold the collateral and do 
whatever it wants to with it.  Your are correct that in practice this cash 
gets commingled with corporate funds and swept into the party's bank account 
but there is no requirement taht it work that way.

We look forward to having a call with your group next week.  Please e-mail me 
with some days and times so that I can alert our people.  thanks.

Has this Master been executed?  I forgot what we specified as the effective 
date of the Transfer and Assignment Agreement with ARMS but we need to make 
absolutely sure that the effective date covers all trades that are done by 
ARMS and that there is no gap between that effective date and the effective 
date of our Master.  Also, please make sure that Tana knows when the 
Utilicorp Master becomes effective so she can notify the online folks.  
Thanks.

Karen:
Here is our response to your e-mail comments:

1. We can put back VI(c)(i) but the reason that we deleted it was because the 
provisions in VI(c)(ii) and VI(E) really deal with how an LC can be drawn 
upon and the language in VI(c)(i) seemed unnecessary and perhaps inconsistent 
with those sections.  If we put it back in, it should be made subject to 
those other sections.

2. With respect to your points regarding the amount that can be drawn, I am 
unclear as to what your position is.  In one place you want to limit it to 
amounts owed and in another you want to limit it to Exposure Amount.  What is 
your position.  We thought that the formula that we set forth in Section 4(b) 
of the amendment was what everyone had agreed to.

3. The reason for the change in E.4.(c) is because the Event of Default 
situation has already been addressed in VI(c)(ii).

4. I need to check with our credit people regarding the transferability 
issue.  I will note that the current form that is attached to the Master 
permits transfers.  Why is this an issue with you?

I look forward to hearing from you.  My number is 713-853-3989.

Thanks,

counsel in Canada about whether we can use your language instaed of ours.

2.   With respect to the Options rep and the ESP rep in part %, Section
(b),
I
believe that both parties need to make such reps.  The rep in Part 5
(b)(g)(ii)
is to cover the Trade Option exemption and it is different from the ESP rep
below it.

3.   With respect to the language in Part 5, Section (a), this is different
from
the setoff language.    What this is saying is that if a party has
fulfilled
all
of its payment obligations and an Event of Default occurs with respect to
it
(the "Defaulting Party"), the other party cannot withhold any payment that
it
owes to the Defaulting Party.  This is different from the exercise of
setoff
rights.

4.   I would like to discuss with you or your legal representative the
removal
of the arbitration language as it is Enron's policy to have arbitration
apply.

5.   We would prefer to keep the Termination Currency specified in US
Dollars.

6.   Our tax group believes that we need the language in Part 3(a)(i),
(ii).
Why do you want to delete it?

I look forward to hearing from you.

Could you please take a look at point #6.  This is the online counterparty 
who had requested in their arbitration language that only monetary damages 
are available as a remedy in any arbitration proceeding and that under no 
circumstances shall specific performance be an available remedy against 
them.  Please let me know what you think.  Thanks.

My comments are shown in CAPS below.  Once we have agreed on the edits to
the Online Agreement, I am assuming that you will provide a revised version
of the agreement for me to review -- is that correct?  I should be able to
respond very quickly once our final power rates record of decision is sent

Joyce:
Per my earlier e-mail message, I have had a chance to discuss your proposed
arbitration language with our litigation manager.  We can accept your
proposed
new language with the following chnages:

1.   From our language in the ETA, we need to keep in the provisions
regarding
treble, exemplary and punitive damages.  This is Enron's current policy.  I
ASSUME YOU ARE REFERRING TO THE SENTENCE:  "ONLY DAMAGES ALLOWED PURSUANT TO
THIS AGREEMENT MAY BE AWARDED AND THE ARBITRATORS SHALL HAVE NO AUTHORITY TO
AWARD TREBLE, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF ANY KIND UNDER ANY
CIRCUMSTANCES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES MAY BE AVAILABLE UNDER THE
LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK AND/OR THE FAA OR AAA."  THIS IS OK AND CAN BE
INCLUDED IN MY SUGGESTED DISPUTE LANGUAGE IN THE PARAGRAPH THAT ADDRESSES
REMEDIES.

2.   In the first paragraph of your language, we would like to delete the
last
sentence.  THIS IS OK.

3.   With respect to the selection of the arbitrators, we would like to keep
our
language that each party can select 1.  We have no problem going with your
language on selecting the third from a list.  THIS IS OK.

4.   We cannot agree that monetary damages are the exclusive remedy.  How
would
we enforce the confidentiality provisions?   We need some other way to be
able
to seek non-monetary remedies for those types of breaches.  THIS MAY BE OUR
ONLY STICKING POINT.    GENERALLY SPEAKING, THE APPROPRIATE REMEDY FOR A
BREACH OF CONTRACT CLAIM IS A MONETARY REMEDY.  IN A BREACH OF CONTRACT
CLAIM AGAINST THE U.S., THE U.S. COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS HAS JURISDICTION
(28 U.S.C. 1491).  SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE IS NOT A REMEDY AVAILABLE AGAINST
THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY HAS NOT BEEN WAIVED FOR SUCH
RELIEF.  [I DO NOTE THAT YOU DID NOT OBJECT TO THIS LANGUAGE IN MY PROPOSED
DISPUTE LANGUAGE SO I ASSUME YOU MAY ALREADY RECOGNIZE THAT FACT.]
SIMILARLY, THERE IS NO GENERAL JURISDICTION FOR THE U.S. COURT OF FEDERAL
CLAIMS TO GRANT INJUNCTIVE RELIEF IN BREACH OF CONTRACT CASES.  BONNEVILLE
IS NOT AMENABLE TO (NOR MAY IT BE LEGALLY AUTHORIZED TO) ENTER INTO
CONTRACTS THAT WOULD PROVIDE ARBITRATORS WITH AUTHORITY BEYOND THAT WHICH
CONGRESS INTENDED TO BE APPLICABLE TO FEDERAL AGENCIES.

I CANNOT ASCERTAIN FROM YOUR COMMENT WHETHER YOUR CONCERN IS THE FACT THAT
BONNEVILLE IS A FEDERAL AGENCY AND SUBJECT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION
ACT.  IF THAT IS YOUR CONCERN, I WOULD LIKE TO OFFER LANGUAGE THAT COULD BE
ADDED TO YOUR CONFIDENTIALITY PROVISION THAT MAY PROVIDE A GREATER LEVEL OF
COMFORT THAT INFORMATION THAT ENRON DEEMS CONFIDENTIAL IS NOT DISCLOSED
WITHOUT AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ENRON TO RESPOND:

"SUBJECT TO BONNEVILLE'S OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (5
U.S.C. 552, AS AMENDED), THE PRIVACY ACT OF 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), THE TRADE
SECRETS ACT OF 1988 (18 U.S.C. 1905), AND ANY OTHER APPLICABLE FEDERAL LAWS,
BONNEVILLE SHALL TREAT AS EXEMPT FROM PUBLIC DISCLOSURE ANY TRADE SECRETS
AND COMMERCIAL OR FINANCIAL INFORMATION FURNISHED PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT
PROVIDED THAT IT IS PRIVILEGED OR CONFIDENTIAL AND IS SO DESIGNATED BY
ENRON.  IN THE EVENT A THIRD PARTY SEEKS DISCLOSURE OF SUCH INFORMATION
UNDER ANY APPLICABLE FEDERAL LAW, BONNEVILLE SHALL PROMPTLY NOTIFY ENRON OF
SUCH EFFORT, AND ANY OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENRON TO PROTEST SUCH DISCLOSURE.
BONNEVILLE SHALL USE ITS REASONABLE EFFORTS TO AVOID DISCLOSURE OF ANY
PRIVILEGED OR CONFIDENTIAL COMMERCIAL INFORMATION."


I look forward to hearing from you.  My number is 713-853-3989.

Subject: Confidentiality Agreement


Carol,

Paul VanderMarck forwarded to me your e-mail (see below) regarding the
confidentiality agreement.  We are fine with entering into a new
confidentiality agreement, based on the form agreed to by the parties a
year ago, however, a couple of changes to the form are needed.

1.  We would like to make sure that our definition of confidential
information is expanded to include our "cleaned" historical weather data
("Weather Data"), weather-risk internet application ("Web Site"),
associated methodologies, user identification codes, and passwords.

2.  The purpose of the disclosure of RMS confidential information would be
to enhance Enron's understanding of RMS technology and services and their
uses within the marketplace.

3.  Enron is granted by RMS, a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to
use the Weather Data for internal evaluation purposes only.  Enron agrees
that it will not modify, create derivative works of, or distribute the
Weather Data to any third party.

4.  Enron agrees to provide RMS with its comments, criticisms, and
suggestions for changes with respect to the Weather Data and Web Site,
including identifying any errors or malfunctions in the operation thereof.

If you can include these items into the new confidentiality agreement
(based on the one the parties executed a year ago), we would be agreeable
to signing it.

Also, our CEO and CFO will be traveling next week.  If it is at all
possible, we would like to get this confidentiality agreement from you no
later than mid day  (PST) on Friday, April 14, 2000 to secure the
appropriate RMS signature.

Please let me know if you have any questions.  I can be reached at (650)
617-6593.  My facsimile is (650) 617-6565.

Thank you.

Paul:
I have spoken with Dave Kistler about the form of CA that you sent to him.
What
we prefer to do is to use the form that was agreed to a year ago (a copy of
which I have attached).  We can either (1) do a new CA based on this form
or (2)
since this CA does not expire for another year, do a side letter that
provides
that the term "Project" as used in this CA means both the project that is
currently described and the new project that we are about to engagae in
with
you.  Please let me know your preference.  My number is 713-853-3989.

Jeff:
Sorry this took so long but here are my thoughts on the above:

1. In Section 3.1 (c), I'm assuming that the additional sections were added 
because we will get these reps in another agreement from the Trust.  Is that 
correct?

2. In Section 3.4 e), the new language regarding rescission of acceleration I 
think belongs after the phrase that begins, "if the effect of such 
failure..."  Also, where did the new language regarding prepayments at the 
end come from?  Is this in the Revolver or in Enron's existing deals? 

3. Section 3.11 should be made subject to Section 5.7 or vice versa.

termination of any business relationship of the parties.   How do you feel

Please keep in mind that we are not basing our decision on which 
counterparties to contact solely based on exposure and credit concern 
information, but rather based on all of the categories that Mark Taylor and I 
have asked you to compile with respect to each counterparty so I don't want 
the exposure numbers to be limited to any particular type of counterparty.

Hi,
I don't know how this was settled between Carol and Russell, and  I don't 
understand why Russell would not
want to provide this exposure information to us.

As we discussed earlier last month, I think it would be good to select a 
date, let's say July 5th in this case, and then go forward.

I like your idea of identifying whether the c/p is a 'credit concern' or a 
'good credit', perhaps this could be listed in the 'status' column
on the following spreadsheet.

I have attached a list of updated counterparty names.


Thanks

Subject: Re: Project  

How did things get settled between Carol and Russell?   Looking over the 
spreadsheet itself, I would be able to tell you right off which 
counterparties we consider "Credit Concerns", where you would then prioritize 
on your end.  Even though some counterparties may high high exposures, we 
consider them to be "Good Credits" (for example Duke).  Once again, financial 
exposures vary (sometimes very significantly) from one day to the next.  
Therefore the totals you'll have for current exposures will not be validated 
for more than a week, at the max.

Let me know how you want to go about this.  I think if I highlight which 
counterparties we feel you should look into, this would go a lot faster.

Mark and Sara:
Tana came into my office last night and seemed to be very upset about how the 
other 2 legal assistants were treating her, especially Susan Bailey, and also 
about the fact taht Susan Bailey was going to be part of Samantha's training 
and that this was a surprise to her.  On the latter issue, I explained to her 
that given that the 2 Susan's were involved in the day to day routine, it 
made perfectly good sense for 1 of them to handle this part of Samantha's 
training especially since Tana was now out of the day to day stuff.  I am 
very concerned that Tana is going to interfere with Susan's training process 
given her attitude toward the whole thing which I really feel is ridiculous.  
The only possibly valid point that she might have is the fact that we didn't 
tell her that this was going to work this way, but even so, again it's Tana's 
way of not be able to let go and not being a team player.  I explained to her 
that both she and Tana had different roles to play with respect to Samantha's 
training and that they both were important and taht in my opinion, Susan was 
more than qualified to handle this part of Samantha's training.

On the first point, I told Tana that the only way that this group is gong to 
work better is through "communicating" to each other.  I firmly believe taht 
there are 2 sides to this and taht all 3 of them are guilty of treating the 
other 2 at time in a not so pleasant way.  Tana of course will not admit 
this.  I have no answers for this issue other than the fact that I am tired 
of hearing about why they can't get along.  I also told Tana taht it was my 
perception that Susan Bailey has been under alot of pressure given her 
increased workload and other things and taht that could explain her attitude 
which even I have noticed has been a little different lately.

I'm letting the both of you know about this because I don't want any of this 
to negatively impact Samantha to the extent that it can be avoided.

It would help if in whatever you send to her today that Enron preserves its 
right to call for margin in the future pursuant to the terms of the agreement
 taht we have with them and that by cancelling the margin call we in no way 
waive our right to make future calls.

Carol:

I called Ferrellgas for Margin yesterday, 6/15, for COB 6/14.  However, 
today's MTM is under the threshold, thus no longer resulting in the need for 
Margin.  I spoke with Erin Hamilton at Ferrellgas and she requested 
confirmation, using today's MTM, that the previous Margin call should be 
cancelled.  Should there be any specific language used in a cancellation 
confirmation about reserving the right to call for Margin in the future, even 
though we will cancel the Margin call for COB 6/14?  Please let me know your 
thoughts.

Thank you,

Mark

Not sure of your exact email address but hopefully one of these is correct.
Can you please confirm that you receive this?

Below is the agreement our attorneys have drafted for the transfer of the
www.weather-desk.com domain name.  Note that they have recommended that a
few of the more specific details regarding the corresponding Enron usage of
the RMS weather model be addressed in a simple but separate license
agreement.   As discussed, in addition to general confidentialiy
provisions, those terms will include (1) the access will not cover any
international weather data that may be added to the system during the term
of use through December 31, as our costs associated with such data are
uncertain and (2) the use of the model will be for Enron internal purposes
only with no data or analysis results to be shared with third parties.

I would appreciate if you can forward this to your legal dept. to review so
that we can hopefully get this resolved quickly.

Thanks/regards

Paul

I don't see a problem with this since the language is standard in most of our 
confirms. One thing though - did the revised  Fallback Reference Weather 
Station language get finalized? I was working with Dave Kistler on this and 
have not heard anything from him on this in over a month. You might check w/ 
him or Mark Tawney to make sure that we include the most recent wording. 

One last query - how is the Confirm Desk going to know whether we have 
included the language as part of the ISDA Master?  They also need to keep in 
mind that with some CP's, such as American Re - we have agreed special 
wording with them and so will have to continue using the longer version of 
confirmation.

The confirms desk has asked us to think about a way that we could shorten the 
confirms that are sent out under Master Agreements by amending each Master to 
include definitions/provisions that are common to all confirms.  Below is 
what I have come up with.  Do you see any problems with this?

Sara and Jason:
Here are my initial thoughts on how we can possibly shorten the weather 
confirms that are done under a Master Agreement.  It seems like we could 
amend the Masters to include the following definitions which seem to be used 
in each conform:

Payment Date
NCDC
NWS
HDD
CDD
The Fallback Reference Weather Station procedures - the confirm would 
identify just the Fallback Reference Weather Station
Data Sources

Let me know what you think.

Carol

Alos, is it necessary to specify bank account information if that is already 
set forth in the Master?

Ed-

Please see attached changes to the LOC Formats proposed by Enron.  I have
revised the draw language and expiration date language to reflect the
changes we agreed to last week.

In addition, I have inserted a paragraph at the end of the LOC form to
reflect a change requested by the bank.  It relates to the ability to
transfer the LOC.  Also attached is the form of transfer statement that the
bank will require if Enron chooses to transfer the LOC to another party.
It looks relatively straight forward and I believe it should be acceptable
to you.

Please review these changes and if acceptable, we can proceed with
execution of the documents.

(See attached file: Enron EEI LOC Format REVISED 052901.doc)

Enclosed is a revised draft of the policy without any modifications on the 
exclusions as this is an area that ACE is apparently continuing to develop.  
As I mentioned yesterday, we will talk with you about this on Monday at 
1(Houston time).  Our commercial team would then like to have a call with ACE 
sometime after our call to talk about exclusions, subrogation rights and 
matters relating to books and records that are addressed in the policy.  I 
don't think that all of you need to be on this call but was wondering if any 
of you would be available for this call.  Please let me know.

Brant
Per our discussions, here is what the Oneok folks want to do.


1. We currently have 2 Masters - one with KN Marketing LP (now known as Oneok 
Energy Marketing & Trading Company, LP) and one with Oneok Gas Marketing 
Company.  Pursuant to the Guaranty that you just received, both Masters are 
currently guaranteed by Oneok Inc.  In addition, both Masters are currently 
guaranteed by Enron Corp. under a $15,000,000 Guaranty for Onoek Gas and a 
$10, 000,000 Guaranty for KN.

2. The Oneok folks want Oneok Gas Marketing to assign all trades and its 
Master to KN Marketing LP and to terminate the KN Marketing LP Master.  When 
all is said and done, there will be one Master with KN Marketing LP and all 
trading activity will be with this entity.  As I mentioned to you, the Master 
that will remain in place has no Credit Support Annex.  How much should the 
Enron Guaranty be for?


Call me if you have any questions.

Susan,
Could you please prepare an assignment and Termination Agreement for this.  
Brant will let us know if any amendments need to be made to the Oneok Master.

Carol

I don't like specifying a time period for termination. I remember we had a 
lengthy discussion on this with Mark Taylor. I seem to recall that the 
solution was that we would employ resonable efforts to process the 
termination request (please confirm with Mark). I don't think they will be 
happy with three days.

David:
Here is a draft of the ETA amendment letter that we have been discussing with 
Kennecott.  It includes my proposed modifications to deal with giving them 
the termination right which I have highlighted.  The current ETA states that 
all notices become effective immediately.  I have inserted in my language a 3 
day period after we receive a termination notice before it becomes 
effective.  This creates a difference between Us and our Counterparty's since 
our termination notice would become effective immediately.  What do you 
think?  Do we need this 3 day period or are you okay with having their 
termination notice becoming effective on the date of our receipt?
Carol

Carol,

We are fine with proposed amendment, item (2) in the June 14, 2000 letter.
I don't understand the purpose for the increase to $10 million proposed in
item (1).  Is this based on current business or some internal credit policy?
My records show, with the exception of June, ESI is in a net sell position
pretty much through the term of the Guaranty.

Please advise and provide your detail if you show otherwise.

While I am still in the process of going through your mark-up, one item that
could move this along considerably is your consideration of the attached in
lieu of your addition of subpart (x) in your Insert 2.  While it
incorporates the same concept, it is a slightly different approach.

There is one issue that is left to resolve.  In the CSA, we define 
independent amount as any amount specified for a party in any Confirmation or 
if no amount is specified, 0.  They wnat to either delete this entirely or 
add language requiring some type of notice to the credit dept. of the party 
that has to put up the independent amount before it becomes effective.  What

the master you have in your office, and to me it seems to be approved for all 
products, including weather & pulp & paper, just not FX.  In Susan Flynn's

		 Subject: FASB 125 deals for 2nd quarter

As promised, here is an update of the deals we have planned to close this 
quarter:  

1. We will be rolling the Alchemy transaction into the Hawaii 125-0 
structure.  We are not sure if the current structure will be unwound 
completely and reconstituted into new entities in the Hawaii structure or if 
the current Alchemy entities will be used.  Regardless, I'm fairly sure that 
the original swap will be unwound and a new confirmation will be done using 
the Hawaii Master Agreement.  We are hoping to close by May 31st. 

2. Resco II/McGarret B - We are doing part two of the first transaction in 
the Hawaii Structure.  EES has requested that we put additional warrants of 
an entity they call Resco into the Hawaii structure.  This should close 
around June 15th. I am sending Resco I/McGarret A documents for the 3/31 
transaction to Sara today.

That is all we know about so far. Gareth is working on both of these deals.   
Blackbird has been put on indefinite hold. I will keep you posted on any 
other information I get about any transactions involving swaps.

Call if you need any more info.  I will make sure you are on the distribution 
list for docs.

Thanks,
B

What a mess this is.  I need your advice on what I should do.  I was told 
that the only way that I can play on the Rice team is to either play with a 
3.5 man or not to play on my Tuesday night league.  Bill tells me that there 
are no 3.5 men available to add to our roster.  Is that true?  This is really 
a difficult choice for me because I really enjoy playing on the Tuesday night 
team and i still feel that we have a chance to advance further.  What do you 
think I should do?

Hi Carol--I bet your ears have been burning for a couple of days!  This is 
the part of tennis that I really don't like.  I've had numerous email 
conversations with the person who originated the email to Cheryl Hultquist.  
Her original email to Cheryl was meant to be an inquiry, not a protest.  One 
of her concerns was that, if our team did make it to a play-off situation, 
and it was determined at that time that you should be a 4.5, then we would 
have to forfeit all games that you played in for the entire season.  This 
evidently happened to her team two years ago.  (I think she's rationalizing 
after-the-fact.)

You probably know that this person--that lodged the "protest"--is Betsie 
Hollis.  She's my women's team captain.  I've called her on the carpet about 
this...and let her know that by trying to hurt Bill Hunt's team, she is 
hurting me, too.  She did try to withdraw her "protest," but Cheryl had 
evidently already taken action.  There are so many people out there that are 
mis-ranked.  The fellow playing with Kelly last Sunday should not be a 
3.5...the woman we played against should not be a 3.5...Elise Shepherd should 
not be a 4.5...and on and on.  I have heard through Roger White--Rice U's 
womens coach and a USTA verifier--that they are slowly trying to rectify 
mis-rankings by looking more closely at league and tournament results.  I 
think you may be the first casualty of this endeavor.

Bill Hunt has all sorts of counter-arguments.  He had Cheryl's approval to 
play you in mixed at 4.0.  Maybe if we promise to play you with our weaker 
4.0 men--who are borderline 3.5 material--they'd let it pass.  Who knows.  If 
we are going to lose you--and Chris after this week--we're going to be pretty 
weak, not to mention demoralized.

After all, we're all just trying to have some fun on the tennis court.  
Speaking of which, this Sunday is Chris' last match before his big move to 
North Carolina.  We're out at Lee LeClear.  I don't remember if you or Bill 
are scheduled to play, but please join us for a little send-off celebration 
after the match if you can.

Just wanted to update you on the call that I had this morning with Jose and 
Pablo.  As a general matter, I think that we are going to be okay with 
offering physical and financial derivative products to Mexican counterparties 
online.  They are in the process of reviewing the online documents and will 
get back to me sometime next week with any thoughts or recommendations.  One 
area that we will need to be careful in is in how we market Enron Online for 
there are restrictions in connection with the offering of "securities".  
While it is fairly clear that commodity based derivatives are not securities  
there may be other products where it is not so clear cut.  I think that it 
would be very helpful if you would send to Jose and Pablo the Online 
materials (i.e, brochures etc.) that we would plan to send to prospective 
counterparties so that we can make sure that our marketing efforts don't 
violate any restrictions taht we would be subject to.

Please send this to Scott Sefton and call the Bracewell person and tell them 
that he is now in charge of this matter.  I haven't had anything to do with 
this file since I joined the swap group.  Thanks.  

Everything is fine.  Still on a hectic schedule but getting a little more 
sleep.  We take the baby to the pediatrician on Thursday for his first 
checkup and I go for mine on Friday.  I've started walking again and some 
very, very slow jogging (don't tell Bill this).  I feel really good and 
everything seems to be healing okay.  I've actually cooked a few meals!  I 
will try to call you in the next day or two.  We've been taking the baby out 
on short trips in the afternoon just to get out of the house.

Carol, attached is the agreement with the changes you requested and my
suggested wording to Section 4. I trust I picked up your changes correctly,
as they were not too clear on the fax.

Except for two small changes in 4,(adding the word "on" in line 12, and
changing "confirmed" to "executed" in the last line) I did not make the
changes you faxed on 2(g) or 4 as we require some language to carve out of
those limitaions the information we use for our offer. Please see what I
suggested instead of the wording sent last time.

Trust this will be acceptable and we can attach this to a letter agreement
stating this is the ETA. This will also have to be referenced in the
Password Agreement

be distributed by ACE sometime tomorrow.  What we would like to do is 
schedule a time on Monday that we could talk with you about it with the hope 
that we could have a discussion with ACE soon afterward.  Could you please 
e-mail to me and Gaurav Babbar some times on Monday that work for you as a 
group and we will get something set up.  Thanks.
Carol

Rod:
I found my file and here is where things stand:

1. On cross default threshold, they wanted it to be the same as the 
collateral threshold but my notes indicate that they were okay leaving it at 
$100,000.

2. In lieu of receiving financials from them, we had agreed to accept 
quarterly and annual Lease Operating Statements.  Did I use the correct 
term?  Do we need a definition for this or is it understood what these 
statements are?  I am also assuming that they are internally prepared.  Is 
that correct?  My notes indicate that these would be provided within 90 days 
after quarter end.

3. We agreed to a collateral threshold for them of $500,000.

4.  For the MAC trigger, is the only test the Net Cash Flow/Revenue test and 
if so, what would trigger the MAC?  Are there other triggers?  We used to 
have Funded Debt/Partners Capital, EBITDA Coverage Ratio and Minimum Partners 
Capital tests.  Alos, here are my proposed definitions:

Cash Flow means Net Income plus depreciation and non-cash charges minus 
capital expenditures as shown on the income statement.

Net Income means gross revenues and other proper income credits, less all 
proper income charges, including taxes on income.

Revenue is cash received from the sale of oil, gas and plant products. 

Should there be references to the Lease Operating Statements in these 
definitions?

5. All Performance Assurance would be rounded up to multiples of $10,000.

This is all that I have.  Let me know what you think.

Just a few questions for you on the revised EEI master that we received from 
Engage today:

1. I just want to confirm that the collateral thresholds should be 9 million.

2. They want to have Section 8.1(b) and 8.2(b) apply which requires a party 
to post collateral if the other party believes that its creditworthiness is 
unsatisfactory.

2. In our Schedule, we delete the 3 day cure period for an event of default 
that occurs as a result of a Guarantor's non-payment.  They want the cure 
period.  do you care?

3. In Section 5.7, each party can suspend performance if a Potential Event of 
Default or an Event of Default occurs. They want to delete Potential Event of 
Default.

4. They want to extend the right to dispute invoices and to request 
adjustments to statements or payments from 12 months to 18 months.

5. They want to change the consent to assignments standard from being able to 
withhold consent in one's sole discretion to being able to withhold consent 
only when it is reasonable to do so.

I look forward to hearing from you.

We are trying to finalize our ISDA with Deutsche Bank.  In the Guaranty where 
we have the setoff and counterclaim language they want to add a proviso that 
basically states that Enron Corp. would be entitled to get the benefit of the 
rights, setoffs, counterclaims and other defenses that ENA is entitled to 
only to the extent taht it would have had the benefit of those rights if it 
were the direct counterparty.  I think that I am okay with this but wanted 
your input.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks.

Luanne:
I made a mistake on the language that we sent you on MAC.  On the last part
where it talks about a failure to be rated, my understanding from our
discussions is that a MAC would only be triggered if a party's credit
support
provider failed to be rated by either S&P or Moody's  so that if it lost one
rating but maintained the other rating a MAC would not be triggered.  For
this
reason the amendment should read ...or its Credit Support Provider shall
fail to
have a rating from either S&P or Moody's.

Please confirm that this is your understanding and sorry for the confusion.

Sandy:
Susan Bailey passed on to me your comments to the ISDA draft and I can 
respond to some but not all of such comments at this point:

1. With respect to your Canadian securities rep, I am checking with our 
counsel in Canada about whether we can use your language instaed of ours.

2. With respect to the Options rep and the ESP rep in part %, Section (b), I 
believe that both parties need to make such reps.  The rep in Part 5 
(b)(g)(ii) is to cover the Trade Option exemption and it is different from 
the ESP rep below it.

3. With respect to the language in Part 5, Section (a), this is different 
from the setoff language.    What this is saying is that if a party has 
fulfilled all of its payment obligations and an Event of Default occurs with 
respect to it (the "Defaulting Party"), the other party cannot withhold any 
payment that it owes to the Defaulting Party.  This is different from the 
exercise of setoff rights.

4. I would like to discuss with you or your legal representative the removal 
of the arbitration language as it is Enron's policy to have arbitration apply.

5. We would prefer to keep the Termination Currency specified in US Dollars.

6. Our tax group believes that we need the language in Part 3(a)(i), (ii).  
Why do you want to delete it?

I look forward to hearing from you.

Was just wondering if you wanted  to play tennis, maybe sometime next week 
(I'm trying to get excited about something next week - work has been very 
busy and I need to fill in it with other things).  Let me know if you want to 
try and play. Hope all is well.

Sheila:
Thanks for offering to participate.  I will probably go ahead and get her the 
gift certificate from Urban Retreat.  I just need to hear back from Mary 
before I get it.  Looks like everyone else has already gotten her a gift.  
Things are going great here.  Charles is now a little over 4 months old and 
almost 16 lbs. and is doing great.  I'm sorry that I haven't been up there 
for a visit but hopefully someday soon before he goes off to college I will 
come up for a visit!  Hope that you are doing well.  Look forward to seeing 
you soon.  Also, we are beginning the "nanny" search.  If you know of someone 
or agency that you would trust please let me know.  We are looking for 
someone to commute to our house each day, but can be flexible on the hours 
because Bill will be here.  Take care and thanks again for the offer on 
Suzanne's gift.  If I do something different, I'll let you know.

Carol - While it never too late to suggest a change, given the political 
situation I would be hesitant to offer anything more than a "clarification".  
While I would not spend a huge amount of time on it, I suggest you examine if 
there are any changes. Depending on what happens in the Senate (now that it 
is in Democratic hands), the process can be reopened and we could have an 
opportunity to offer suggested changes (or it kill the bill all together).

Would it be too late to suggest changes to the definition of "forward 
contracts" in the Bankruptcy Code in order to improve our position with 
respect to the physical supply contracts that EES enters into?  I am not sure 
what chnages we would want, but was wondering if there was any opportunity to 
suggest a change.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks.

Thanks for the message.  I don't think there is any way that we will get 100% 
pay on all 8 weeks so let's just go with the 100/90 split.  you may want to 
ask michelle how best to code it with my vacation time so that they get it 
right the first time.    as for charles, he is doing great.  i'm typing all 
small letters now because he is insisting on me holding him, but i'm learning 
how to do more than 1 thing at a time.  he is a night owl so i try to sleep 
some in the afternoon and so far so good.  i'm learning how to exist on 
little sleep.  it is a big help to have bill at home and while charles 
sleeps, we get alot done as there are still some house things that we need to

Well, I survived the dentist (7 hours in the chair),  Of course I started my 
period too, so I had cramps a backache and headache and my mouth open all 
going on at the same time.  It was NOT fun at all, but I made it through. 
It's nice to know the worst is over.  My temporaries look pretty good too.  I 
still have to go by the lab and do a couple of other things, but my permanent 
teeth should be put in on August 18th.  I'm just going to take the day too 
because lord only knows how long it'll take!  Then I'm finished until next 
year!  Whew!

I'll figure up 4 weeks of sick time and then I'll do your vacation and then 
do 4 more weeks of sick time.  I emailed Michelle Word from your email if the 
8 weeks were all 100% paid, so if you get that email, be sure and let me know 
what she says.  I'm trying to get you 8 weeks at 100% pay.  

It's pretty quiet around here so far today.  Dan's birthday is next Monday 
and we are going to take him to lunch and I'm getting him cigars (of 
course).  Mine is also coming up so Ric is going to take me to Pappas 
Steakhouse.  I've never been there and have been wanting to go.  He's already 
made the reservations and everything.  I can't believe I'm going to be 
45!!!!!!!  My body feels every year though!

How are you adjusting?  Charles sleeping any longer?  Keep in touch.  Oh, I 
received the thank you cards and will distribute them.  Thank you for the 
nice one to me.

Hi Carol:

Enclosed is latest draft.  Please note that I changed DB's Threshold at A+
to bring it into line with Enron's rating.  I also added a sweep-in clause
to deal with the BT Transactions (Section 18).  Please let me know if those
provisions are acceptable.  Subject to internal DB approvals, I think the
other substantive points still open are (i) a Moody's rating for the MAC
clause, (ii) the demand section in the Guaranty, and (iii) determining the
L/C provisions and mechanics.  Please let me know who your replacement on
this matter will be and, if we don't speak before you leave, good luck and
congratulations.

Regards,

Steve

Carol, 
The west desk is presently working on a deal to serve a large industrial 
customer, Knauf,  newly located within the franchise area of a tiny northern 
California municipality, The City of Shasta Lake.  It makes sense to do a 
price swap with Knauf.  Our champion, Laird Dyer, says that Knauf wants to do 
an ISDA.  This would be a perfect situation for you, with your ISDA 
background, to help me, (working on the corresponding physical piece with the 
City of Shasta) to team up and help us get this deal done.  Can you help us 
in this manner?  ----cgy

Below is a summary of the surety bond issues that I believe we need to 
resolve in order to feel comfortable accepting it as a form of collateral to 
secure a counterparty's obligations with respect to physical power purchase 
and sale transactions:

1.  Determine whether an issuer can refuse to honor a draw made under a 
surety bond if after issuance, it determines that the bond was issued in 
violation of the appleton statute.  What type of legal comfort should we 
receive from the issuer at the outset to get comfortable that the bond was 
validly issued and is enforceable against such issuer?

2. Determine the proper minimum credit rating(s) that should apply to the 
issuer.

3. In the form of bond that we were given, the "Now Therefore" language in 
the third paragraph is not acceptable.  Determine what can be said in its 
place to establish the necessary linkage back to the transaction covered by 
the Confirmation.

4. Make sure that the bond can be drawn down no matter what type of Event of 
Default occurs, even if such event is not related to the transaction that the 
bond references.  The Notice of Claim language needs to be written more 
generically to accommodate this. 

5. Does credit need a "pre-bankruptcy" trigger that would require Reliant to 
convert all outstanding bonds into LC's or cash collateral?  If so, what 
would this trigger be?

Let me know if you have any additional issues.  I will be discussing some of 
these with our outside counsel shortly.

Carol,

I am helping the Weather Desk to develop a new product (PJM Power Demand). It 
will initially be traded only internally.

I send you a presentation of the product and its description for EOL.

I think that we should schedule a time, so that we can discuss the product.

Thanks,

Claudio

While I am still in the process of going through your mark-up, one item that
could move this along considerably is your consideration of the attached in
lieu of your addition of subpart (x) in your Insert 2.  While it
incorporates the same concept, it is a slightly different approach.

Enclosed is a new draft of the Kennecott amendment letter.  Mark and I have 
discussed the counterparty termination language and have come up with the 
language that I have high;lighted.  Upon your approval, I plan to use the 
same language for the Duke and Cinnergy letters.

Rod:
Here are their credit issues:

1. In the cross-default language that want to add language that basically 
says that even if a cross-default occurs, unless the Non-Defaulting 
determines in good faith that performance by the Defaulting Party of its 
obligations under the Master is "endangered", then no cross default is 
triggered.

2. In Credit Event Upon Merger we had commented that instaed of the 
"materially weaker" standard we wanted to specify that it meant being rated 
below BBB- by S&P.  Do you feel strongly about this?  Alos, we usually have 
language that says that if an event like merger occurs and the transferee 
provides collateral to the other party in an amount that is satisfactory to 
such party, then a Credit Event Upon Merger is not triggered.  They did not 
want to add this carve-out.  Are you okay with this?

3. They want a separate Event of Default that gets triggered if a MAC (below 
BBB-) occurs.  We requested that it be out in the collateral threshold 
language.

4. They are saying that for "operational" purposes, they cannot agree to 
"netting".

5. They want as a category of Eligible Collateral governmental securities 
with a maturity of less than 1 year, valued at 98%.

6. In the CSA, if a dispute occurs with respect to either the calculation of 
Exposure or the calculation of the value of any colateral in connection with 
a party's request either for the transfer or return of collateral, normally 
the following procedures apply:

a. the disputing party notifies the other party of the nature of the dispute 
by the close of business on the day following the day that the collateral 
request was made.

b. the undisputed amount is transferred to the party making the request

c. the parties attempt to resolve the dispute by the "Resolution Time" and if 
a resolution is not reached, a recalculation of the Exposure is made and 
market quotations have to be obtained.

We normally say that the Resolution Time is 3 Business Days after the dispute 
notice is given.  DB wants to shorten this period to 1 Business Day after the 
dispute notice is given which gives the parties less time to resolve the 
dispute on their own.  What do you think?

7. If a party holds cash as collateral, we normally say that interest earned 
is transferred on the first day of the month.  They want to change first to 
last.

Let me know what you think.  I was hoping that some of these you could 
resolve with your counterpart at DB.

Here is where things stand on Engage:

1.  Engage Energy US LP - Luke and I have agreed on the new draft of 
amendment.   The Credit Support Provider will be Coastal.  Luke is sending me 
their form of Guaranty which I will take a look at.  It will cover just the 
Engage Energy US financial transactions and have a cap of $10,000,000 

2. Engage Energy Canada LP - It will stay as currently written although the 
Guaranty from Westcoast will have now a cap of $10,000,000 and only cover the 
Engage Canada financial transactions.

I need to make some minor chnages to the Engage US amendment and then it will 
be ready and you can coordinate with Luke in getting it executed.

Would it be possible to assign names instead of numbers to the documents that 
you e-mail so that we can tell which document is which?  The only reason I am 
asking for this is because some of us don't need to review all of the 
documents and it would be alot easier with names to print out the document 
that we need.  Thanks.

Attached are the initial drafts of a closing checklist and the related 
closing documents to pay off and unwind Project Alchemy and place the asset 
into the Project Hawaii structure.  This transaction is structured as a trust 
to trust transfer, which is contemplated in the Amended and Restated Hawaii 
125-O Facility Agreement.  The anticipated closing date for this transaction 
is May 31, 2000.  The only significant missing information in the documents 
is the maturity date and the related auction dates.  Please advise as to the 
maturity date and I will calculate the auction dates.

The documents attached are clean versions in Word.  Immediately following 
this e-mail, I will send a follow-up e-mail with clean versions of each 
document in Word Perfect.  Following that, I will send two e-mails attaching 
copies of the documents marked against the Project Blackbird Unwind and 
related Hawaii 125-O Danno A documents, in both Word and Word Perfect.

Please review the attached documents and call me with any comments or 
questions.  My direct line is 214-659-4461 and my direct fax is 
214-659-4784.  Please let me know if any additional people should be a 
recipient of future e-mails for this transaction.  Also, please forward this 
e-mail to anyone that you are aware of who needs to review the documents and 
has not received this e-mail.

It would be nice if they could give us a counterparty name - I've never heard 
of Jerry Peskuchi.

Everybody,

Tanya suggested I ask all of you if you know anything related to a hotline 
call I took yesterday afternoon.  I got a call from John Arnold who wanted to 
know who was working on getting an ISDA in place with a subsidiary of 
Citibank. He thought it was a hedge fund, he wasn't sure.  He said that they 
were getting very impatient to start dealing with us.  He left a contact for 
Citibank:  Jerry Peskuchi (212) 723-7065, who wants to be updated on the 
status of the master.

Sorry I didn't bring this up in the morning meeting, but please let me know 
if any of you know anything about this, because I had no idea who to direct 
his call to and could only promise to try and find the right person handling 
this and pass the info on.

Hi,
Jeff asked me to forward the new report to you.

Here is the format of the new report and a brief description of each tab:

1. formerage-Willie's prior aging schedule. Do we want to see this for each 
c/p? I think it would be helpful
2. aging-Current aging schedule by year
3. STC-Dcaf-Current physical STC information from Dcaf
4. STC-Tagg-Current physical STC information from tagg
5. financial-Current and new format. If you move the lower bar to the right 
of the gray boxes, you will see the new columns
     which we've discussed.

I completed the master agreement column from the Lotus Notes database;

We are currently waiting on credit for the exposure information and their 
assessment (e.g. 'credit concern', 'good credit', etc.);

Tagg is able to provide term information for each counterparty, but since it 
is a time-intensive process, Ron Nolte is looking
into adding a button in tagg that will allow this and/or create a special 
customized ongoing report;

I am in the process of completing the remaining two columns (i.e. do they 
sign confirms?, if they don't, reasons why?)

Overall, I think that this new format, including my proposed aging schedule, 
will be a valuable 'tool' for all involved in our
follow-up work. 

Thanks
David

Please keep in mind that we are not basing our decision on which 
counterparties to contact solely based on exposure and credit concern 
information, but rather based on all of the categories that Mark Taylor and I 
have asked you to compile with respect to each counterparty so I don't want 
the exposure numbers to be limited to any particular type of counterparty.

Hi,
I don't know how this was settled between Carol and Russell, and  I don't 
understand why Russell would not
want to provide this exposure information to us.

As we discussed earlier last month, I think it would be good to select a 
date, let's say July 5th in this case, and then go forward.

I like your idea of identifying whether the c/p is a 'credit concern' or a 
'good credit', perhaps this could be listed in the 'status' column
on the following spreadsheet.

I have attached a list of updated counterparty names.


Thanks
David

How did things get settled between Carol and Russell?   Looking over the 
spreadsheet itself, I would be able to tell you right off which 
counterparties we consider "Credit Concerns", where you would then prioritize 
on your end.  Even though some counterparties may high high exposures, we 
consider them to be "Good Credits" (for example Duke).  Once again, financial 
exposures vary (sometimes very significantly) from one day to the next.  
Therefore the totals you'll have for current exposures will not be validated 
for more than a week, at the max.

Let me know how you want to go about this.  I think if I highlight which 
counterparties we feel you should look into, this would go a lot faster.

Regards--VE

This morning Carol and I discussed the ETA, and I indicated our concern that
sections 2(g) and 4 be amended so TLM can rely on the information on the
Website which we use for our offer. She is going to address this with Mark
Taylor and call us back. I believe it is a matter of finding words to
satisfy both of us.

Please note that our requests in section 2 (b) and (d) will not be included,
as section 3(c) governs.

Enron also advises in section 6(b) the assignment and consent will only
apply to assignments made by TLM not Enron, and our remedy would be to stop
using the website until we were satisfied with their assignee.

Carol and I also discussed the possibility of having a letter agreement with
the Amended ETA attached,(rather than an 'exceptions' letter), which would
be the governing doc once we 'click'.

I believe we are very close to concluding this.

Best regards
Anne

Jack:
I will send you an open issues list shortly.  I considered items # 2,3,4,6, 
9, 12, 17, 18, 19 and 21 to be credit-related comments, some of which I need 
my credit person's input on.  As to the remaining points, here is my response:

1. Let's discuss exactly what language you want in item #1 as I agree with 
you on the concept.

2. With respect to item #7,  your interpretation is correct.

3. I am not clear on what your point is in items #9 and 21.  As a general 
rule, with respect to setoff rights, to the extent that ENA is the 
Non-Defaulting Party and ENA's affiliates have entered into other agreements 
with Inland Paperboard and Packaging, amounts owed under those affiliate 
agreements can be setoff against amounts owed under the ISDA.  All the 
guaranty is trying to say is that the amount guaranteed under the Guaranty 
takes into account the exercise of such setoff rights.

4. I'm not sure I understand your point #10.

5. I agree with your point #13.

6. With respect to point #14, collateral is limited to cash and LC's and the 
concept of a custodial account applies when someone other than the Secured 
Party is holding  the cash collateral.

7. With respect to point #19, we want the ability to convert the LC into cash 
collateral when an Event of Default occurs even if we have not yet terminated 
all transactions.  Once we have terminated and established a termination 
amount, we would only draw to cover that amount if we didn't draw earlier.

8. The "deemed occurrence" language  is meant to cover termination events 
that occur automatically without either party electing to terminate, such as 
in a bankruptcy scenario where automatic early termination is elected.  We 
could probably take it out since there is no automatic early termination on 
bankruptcy.

I look forward to hearing from you.  My credit person is out this week, but 
maybe you and I can make some progress.

Hi Carol -
Sorry for the delay.  The "credit person" at Inland is probably Julie Beck,
although she can naturally be overruled by the Temple-Inland Treasurer, Dave
Turpin, or CFO Randy Levy, since Temple-Inland will be obtaining the letter
of credit and will serve as guarantor.  Since they are at least one step
removed from the process, if you could tell me what questions/comments from
my 5/16 memo they will need to address, and ideally your
responses/commentary in some summary format, I can upstream this information
to them, obtain their feedback, and speak on their behalf.
Thanx,
Jack Falconi

Please review message below from Kristina Drew @ Merchant Energy.  I thought 
you would be the appropriate lawyer to work on this as it involves EPMI as 
well as a derivative piece with ENA.

FYI:  the assignment is not of immediate need, being that FERC approval must 
secured.

If you do not think this to be the case, please advise as to who should work 
on this matter.

Carol,

I am helping the Weather Desk to develop a new product (PJM Power Demand). It 
will initially be traded only internally.

I send you a presentation of the product and its description for EOL.

I think that we should schedule a time, so that we can discuss the product.

Thanks,

Claudio

Tanya and Sara:
Just an update on the ones that I am handling:

Aquila/Utilicorp will be in place tomorrow
Idacorp should be done this week as i spoke with their counsel today
Pancanadian  - we are waiting for them to decide whether they will accept the 
ISDA form of CSA
Reliant - we do have their form and Rod and I are working through credit 
issues
El Paso - I am waiting for a revised draft from them but we are close
J Aron - done

Sara,

After looking at the list, we are on top of most of it:

aquila risk - we should be assigning all the trades to the new Utilicorp ISDA 
and terminating Aquila Risk master
jaron - we have a new ISDA; Jeff probably just isn't reflecting it yet
el paso - Brant is currently negotiating the new ISDA

The following are in negotiation and are Top 10s:
- idacorp
- wps
-pancanadian
-duke energy mktg ltd (i think this one is all but signed)
- mieco
-dynegy canada

I know you have had initial discussions with the counterparties and have 
discussed the need to put new documentation in place with:
- morgan
- vitol

Lastly, we were waiting on Reliant to give us an updated draft ISDA; however, 
now that Randy Baker has left Reliant, they are not likely to address for 
awhile.  Tracy can ask Kelly about trying to get something in place.

The others can probably wait until we get some of the above executed. Dynegy 
and Sempra are probably the most important of those left.  Dynegy should not 
be too difficult; however, Sempra is a master financial/physical and will be 
more problematic.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Tanya

through Enron stock options.=20

As you may know, the current employee stock option program (also known as t=

program from its inception have realized a 1,119% increase in the value of=
=20
their stock options (assuming a stock price of $70) over the life of the=20
program.  =20

Enron stock options are a valuable part of your total compensation package=

Management Development Committee of the Enron Board of Directors have decid=

to continue to offer stock options as a part of your compensation package.

On May 1, 2000, the Committee approved an employee stock option program for=

It is=20

Why commit your talent and energy to Enron?  EnronOptions =01) Your Stock O=

In the coming weeks, you will be receiving more details about EnronOptions =

work in making today such a special event for me and Charles Eugene!  As I 
said at the shower, I'm lucky to have people like you as friends and

to finally putting all of my gifts to good use in the upcoming weeks.

I spoke with the contact that you left me last week and she indicated that 
the ISDA had not yet been signed but that in all likelihood it would be 
signed in a few days.  I asked Susan bailey to send you the certificate with 
resolutions that you requested along with a new draft of the Transfer 
Agreement which has a blank for the date.  My thought was that everything 
would become effective on the date that we insert in the Transfer Agreement 
and I would ask that you coordinate with Susan bailey when you know what that 
date will be so that we can make sure that our systems reflect when the 
trades are to be confirmed under the Utilicorp Master.  Thanks.

Mr. May:
I am working with Lisa Mellencamp on this matter and I just wanted to let you 
know that we will be sending you sometime tomorrow a completed draft of the 
amendment to the financial derivative and physical agreements that we want 
the Court to approve.  The purpose of the amendment is to expand our setoff 
rights and to add additional events of default/termination events that relate 
to events that may occur during the bankruptcy proceeding.  We will be out of 
the office the rest of the week at our legal conference but you can leave me 
or Lisa a voice mail message with any comments or questions that you may 
have.  My number is 713-853-3989.
  Enclosed is a preliminary draft that just deals with the financial 
derivative agreement.  Another lawyer in our group is handling the physical 
agreement amendments.

Carol, attached is the agreement with the changes you requested and my
suggested wording to Section 4. I trust I picked up your changes correctly,
as they were not too clear on the fax.

Except for two small changes in 4,(adding the word "on" in line 12, and
changing "confirmed" to "executed" in the last line) I did not make the
changes you faxed on 2(g) or 4 as we require some language to carve out of
those limitaions the information we use for our offer. Please see what I
suggested instead of the wording sent last time.

Trust this will be acceptable and we can attach this to a letter agreement
stating this is the ETA. This will also have to be referenced in the
Password Agreement

Bill:
Thanks for the information.  I need to take a closer look at Janet's 
language, particularly the "null and void" language to make sure that it 
covers all possible events of default under the Master Agreement.  As to the 
Texas law issue, our ability to get comfortable from a legal standpoint will 
in large part be dictated by this issue.  Is there anyway to get more 
certainty on this with the sureties?  I understand that you don't want to go 
to them multiple times but this is a key issue for us.  Let me know what you 
think.

In my opinion, the wording suggested by Janet Green should be acceptable.
We
will have to have this wording formally approved by the surety companies
prior
to issuance.  I would like to avoid approaching the sureties until all
questions
have been addressed and all changes have been made.  In regards the bonds
being
subject to Texas law, I do not see that as being a problem.  We will
address
that with the sureties along with other potential changes.

In response to previous email, neither Dan nor I know of an attorney that
would
be willing or able to write an opinion in regards the applicability of the
Appleton Law.  As discussed during the meeting, this law has nothing to do
with
the viability of an exisitng surety bond.  If a surety issued a bond that
was
later found to be in violation of Appleton, they would be fined by the
State of
New York.  It does not make the bond invalid.  MJH

What if we said:  "if the
Principal shall promptly and faithfully perform its obligations under the
Confirm, which is a part of and governed by the Master Agreement, then this
obligation shall be null and void"

With respect to her second point, what if we again said "an Event of
Default has occurred under the Confirm, which is a part of and governed by
the Master Agreement"?

I think she is trying to clarify in the language that the bond can be
called for an Event of Default under the Master Agreement, which could have
nothing to do with the Confirm - - - which is factually correct.

Thankyou for the attached.  I believe the governing law for each issuing
surety will be the law where the surety is domiciled, but let me do some
checking and confirm this.  Also, will get back to you on your comments Re
the language in our recommended bond form...probably Monday or Tuesday next
week.  Thanks for your continued efforts in this matter.

Bill:
I spoke with our outside counsel yesterday and we have some more follow up
work that we need to do on our side.  One issue that may be of some
importance to us in our analysis is determining what the governing law of
the surety bond will be for each issuer, and more importantly, whether we
can have the bonds governed by Texas law.  Can you answer this for me?

Also, with respect to the form of the bond itself, as we mentioned at the
meeting, the language in the third paragraph which states that "if the
Principal shall promptly and faithfully provide the Firm energy as defined
in the Confirm, hen this obligation shall be null and void," does not work
for us.  Has anyone come up with alternative language?  Finally, with
respect to the Notice of Claim, we would like for the certification to say
something like, "an Event of Default has occurred under the Master
Agreement" rather than tie it to a specific default under the Confirmation.
Does that work for the sureties?

I look forward to hearing from you.

Their lawyer finally called me.  We have a few open credit issues on our side 
that I need for you to think about:


1. Are you okay with the cross default threshold on both sides being 3% of 
stockholders' equity?  They didn't like $100,000,000.

2. For corporate policy reasons, they cannot take advantage of affiliate 
setoff.  Since I wasn't sure what relationships ENA and its affiliates had 
with this counterparty, I wasn't sure how strongly you felt about it.  Please 
advise.

I understand there is an email out, which I haven't received, telling us that 
the people will be moving back into their offices tomorrow.  The next phase 
will start next week.  People have to be out of their offices by August 
23rd.  That'll work out perfectly!  I'll have you packed up and hopefully 
somewhere to put everything.  I've ordered boxes and packing bubbles for your 
photographs.  Anyway, I'm sure you'll get a memo.  He must have put it on the 
slowest possible method of getting to us.

Jim Grace came in yesterday, but I didn't say anything to him.  Dan, of 
course, had to say "how's it going" or something like that.  

Everything is fine here I guess.  I can't think of anything to report.  How 
are you doing?

Here is my first cut at a proposed form of amendment.  I have added a rep and 
an additional Event of Default to cover the 'Lien" issue in light of the fact 
that Barrett's Credit Agreement restricts them from entering into any 
agreement that contains a negative pledge.  I winged the amendment to the 
Confirmations since I have not seen them yet.  Please call me with any 
comments.

Dear Carol,    We do not want to create an agreement specfic coversheet for
each counterparty.  Is there some way to put language in the body of the
letter agreement to address your concerns.  The procedure we are proposing
is intended to supplement current requirements in the ISDA, not replace
them.  If you feel that additional definition needs to be added to the
confirmation process, shouldn't we put that definition in the letter
agreement rather than on the cover sheet?

Our goal is to be able to expedite our response to counterparty confirms.
In order to do this we need to have the same cover sheet in place for each
counterparty.  Please call me at 678-579-3378 so that we may discuss
possible solutions.  Thanks, Lin

Pablo and Jose:
Thanks for the update.  Based on the marketing information that you received 
from us yesterday, are there any restrictions on our folks in Mexico going 
forward with their marketing efforts?  If so, please advise.  Prior to 
receiving you written advice, would it be possible to schedule a call maybe 
on Wednesday of next week with myself and Jaime so that we can at least 
outline any potential online issues, both in connection with our marketing 
efforts and in connection with the online documents that you are reviewing? I 
am available anytime after 2:30 (Houston time) on Wednesday and I am wide 
open on Thursday.

Please include Jim Crump in the Inland meeting that I need to have with Ken 
Curry.  He would like to meet as early on Tuesday as possible as he will be 
travelling later on Tuesday.  His assistant's name is Dora Trevino.  Does Ken 
Curry have an assistant that can access his calendar?  If not, why don';t you 
get a time that works for Jim and me and leave Ken a voice mail message so he 
can get back to you on Monday.  We need about 1 hour.  thanks.

 Carol -- I came across this message from Sarah Duckers last night as
I was cleaning out my e-mails.  I don't know if you have found a nanny yet
or if Sarah's fill-in nanny is still available but I thought I would pass
this on just in case.  Hope all is well.

Carol -

Two things:

* First, I will try to email this guaranty to you again, followed with
a fax.  Apparently both failed to go through yesterday.
* Second, I did some research and it turns out that our general
partner is El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas Company, and Cecelia Heilmann is an
officer authorized to sign for both this entity and the L.P..  So if you
want to alter the signature block reflecting this general partner, feel free
to do so.

Please let me know later this morning if you still did not get our Guaranty.

FYI.  Ignore the Enron Guaranty but make sure that the PSE&G Guaranty that 
you eventually get conforms to this.

I think that 2 minor chnages need to be made to the Enron Guaranty and
probably
the PSE&G Guaranty:

1.   Change in the first paragraph "Enron North America Corp., a Delaware
corporation to Enron North America Corp., a Delaware corporation and its
successors and assigns

2.   In the definition of "Agreement" include language that would pick up
amendments, supplements, replacements and restatements thereof so its reads
:"such ISDA Master Agreement, together with each Confirmation exchanged
between
the parties thereto and together with any and all amendments, supplements,
replacements and restatements thereof, hereinafter the "Agreement")

Let me know if you have a problem with this.

Jack:
Thanks for your e-mail.  I met with our credit people this morning and can 
respond to some of the credit points raised in your May 16th memo:

1. With respect to item #2, I know of no case law on this point and our 
credit group cannot agree to delete this concept from the Collateral 
Threshold definition.  

2. With respect to item #3, we can agree to define materially weaker the way 
you suggested with  additional language that states that any drop below BBB- 
also counts as a trigger.

3. With respect to item #4, we can agree to a definition tied to an objective 
rate which my credit person is thinking about.

4. With respect to item #6, I'm waiting for my credit person to confirm that 
your comment is correct.

5. I understand from your latest e-mail that no changes will be made to the 
definition and use of affiliates in any of the agreements.

6. With respect to item #12, we can agree to increase our rounding amount to 
$500,000 and to limit "returns" of collateral to once a week.  We cannot 
agree to change  the frequency for requesting/delivering collateral.  Given 
the high rounding intervals, we feel that unless there is a huge market 
change, it is unlikely that collateral requests will be made every day.

7. With respect to item #14, there is no requirement to escrow cash 
collateral that is being held and the Secured Party is free to do whatever it 
wants to with the cash until the events in 13(g)(ii) occur, in which case the 
cash collateral must be held by a Qualified Institution.

8. With respect to item #19, if we draw the entire amount of the LC and the 
termination amount that we are owed is less than the LC amount, we would be 
required under the documents to return any excess amount to you.  All we are 
doing in an Event of Default situation is converting the LC into cash 
collateral that we hold subject to the terms of the documents.

9. We can agree to make the chnages that you requested in item #18.

I still need some clarification on the point you were making in item #17 and 
I will look at your other comments in today's e-mail and respond shortly.  
Are you okay with the Enron and Inland forms of Guaranty?

about Sections 2(c) and 7?  The latest draft is the June 9 draft, but we are
still commenting on it.

Jeff:
Has there been any discussion on our side with who the Calculation Agent
would
be?  Normally, it is one of the swap counterparties.  Is this a role that
Enron
Corp. can and should perform?  With respect to the Agreement, I am looking
at a
June 2nd draft and was wondering if anyone has focused on the language in
Section 2, and in particular, Section 2(c)  and Section 7.

David:
GPU Energy had the following comments to the ETA:

1.  In Section 2(a) they want Enron to represent that it owns and has the 
legal right to grant to Counterparty the use of the Website.  Also, in the 
second sentence where we say that they cannot utilize the Website on behalf 
of third parties they want to exclude Affiliates.  [Leslie, is this a proper 
exclusion given our conversation this week about who will be applying for the 
Website password?]

2. They have deleted Section 4(b) and seem to think that we should provide a 
similar indemnity.


I can handle point #2, but what do you think about point #1?

Carol

As you work through these issues, please remember that even though the Mexico

expect many other products to appeal to their customers, the EnronOnline 
people will expect all products listed online to be available unless we can

Carol,

I've been working with Jaime Williams and our outside tax advisors to 
determine the Mexican tax consequences applicable to those products that 
Jaime has informed me will be offered to Mexican counterparties through 
EnronOnLine and, potentially, a separate ENA Mexican entity.  I should be 
able to provide the results by Friday or Monday.  Please contact me at ext. 
35777 if you'd like to discuss in the meantime.

Best regards,

Jeff

Jeff:
As I think you are aware, the Meixco and online group want to implement 
online trading for Mexican counterparties.  Are there any tax issues taht we 
should be aware of?  If we conduct online trades using ENA and telephone 
trades with an Enron Mexican entity, will the exercise of setoff rights 
create any tax issues?   My understanding is that the Enron counterparty will 
be ENA.

Attached you will find the latest draft of the new Master Form.  Please 
review and send me any comments today--we'd like to get this out to the 
business team by 3:00 today.  I think all of the comments we received and 
developed in the last 3 meetings have been incorporated, including the 
bankruptcy matters.  Because there are so many changes, I don't think a 
blackline would be helpful--however, let me know if you want one.   I have 
bracketed questions and open issues and highlighted areas that I think need 
either more work or extra attention from the business teams.  I'd like to see 
us be able to pare this document down just a bit--I think a 5 page master and 
a 1 to 1 1/2 page confirmation is reasonable.  Thanks.   MDS

Thanks Carol, I understand you are only focusing on the Online transactions, 
and all I ask from you is the clearance to do Online transactions.
Regarding Credit, Rod Nelson has been supporting us and he is leaving all the 
pending things to Paul Radous.  Last week Rod and I spoke abut this, and his 
view is a little different. He believes there could be some exposure if the 
same counterparty transacts both on-line and off-line; however, there are 
ways to limit the transactions and very probably the likelihood of that 
happening is very little.  He was going to put together an opinion froom 
their side, and I suggest we have a conference call wednesday morning....
I am traveling wednesday but reachable through my assistant Barbara. 
011-452-8-152-2404.   PLease call any time is convenient for you so we can 
discuss this matter and also talk to your counsel.
Thanks and regards.

Here is a message that I received from our counsel.  Again, I and they are 
just focusing on the Enron Online issues and Sara is handling the issues 
relating to doing transactions offline between Enron Mexico and the Mexican 
counterparties.  I will suggest to our counsel that we have a call mid next 
week involving you, me and them.  What is your availability on Wednesday?  
Alos, who from credit are you dealing with and are they aware that we 
probably will not be able to in a bankruptcy situation offset amounts owed 
with respect to the online and offline transactions?

Are there any tax issues that we need to be concerned about regarding the 
online piece of this?

Hi Carol:

Enclosed is latest draft.  Please note that I changed DB's Threshold at A+
to bring it into line with Enron's rating.  I also added a sweep-in clause
to deal with the BT Transactions (Section 18).  Please let me know if those
provisions are acceptable.  Subject to internal DB approvals, I think the
other substantive points still open are (i) a Moody's rating for the MAC
clause, (ii) the demand section in the Guaranty, and (iii) determining the
L/C provisions and mechanics.  Please let me know who your replacement on
this matter will be and, if we don't speak before you leave, good luck and
congratulations.

Regards,

Steve

Thank you for your comments Carol.  By copy of this email, I am forwarding
them on to John Shuttee who is now responsible for ISDA negotiations.  He is
out of the office the remainder of this week but as of Monday he can be
reached at my old phone number of 713-420-3548.

Thank you.

Susan:
We have finally had a chance to internally discuss the comments that you
sent to
Marie Heard on March 21 by e-mail and here is our response:

ISDA Comments

1.   Item #1 is fine

2.   We will agree to $100,000,00 for both parties

3.   It is Enron's Policy to use Loss instead of Market Quotation, which I-
believe is the standard that is currently used in the existing Master.  As a
compromise, we can agree to Market Quotation for Transactions with a term of
2
years or less as of the applicable termination date and Loss for all others.

4.   Item #4 is fine.

5.   Our credit people want to keep MAC where it is as a trigger that
reduces
the collateral threshold to zero.

6.   I would like to discuss with you what we are doing with the existing
Guarantys.

7.   Item #7 is okay but we would prefer a separate termination agreement.

8.   I need to discuss with you items #8 and 10

CSA COMMENTS

1.   Item #1 is fine

2.   We cannot agree to item #2 and would like for it to remain at 20

3.   I would like to discuss item #3 with you

Also, some of the changes that were made were not marked (i.e., no fault
termination was not in our draft, but in yours).  Could you please e-mail me
your latest versions so that I can make sure that I have seen all of the
changes?  With respect to no-fault termination, we cannot as a policy matter
agree to that.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Carol (713-853-3989)

Thanks.  Is there a polite way to discourage flowers?  Bill is allergic and 
we just end up throwing them out after a day or 2.  Cash and diaper donations 
are always acceptable!!! (just kidding).    We have been getting alot of 
stuff and I really appreciate it.  Thank you notes were sent to you by mail.  
On my mail, just collect it and send it out once a week.  Can you please send 
those 3 white boxes to me that are in my office at the end of this weeK?  
Bill did talk to his mother and I think persuaded her to wait a few weeks 
until I'm more mobile which I am hoping will occur in a week or so.  
Hopefully by next week I can be driving.  I'm not getting much sleep but I'm 
really enjoying this experience.  I think that Charles looks like Bill with 
my nose but I will let you be the judge when you see him which hopefully can 
happen in a week or so.  I'll keep in touch and thanks again for all that you 
have done.  Tell Ric I hope to see him at the club in a few weeks.

You should be getting lots of flowers and gifts because quite a few people 
have called for your address.  I see your email is working now.  How are 
things?  Did you talk to your mother-in-law?

It's been extremely quiet over here, but Susan Bailey is going crazy.  They 
must have given her what she wanted since she's still here.  No other news.

Michele, Carol had her baby last night and had to have a csection.  Does this 
add time to her maternity leave?  What about the other 26 weeks that we are 
given for illness.  She can't use them?  Suzanne (Carol's assistant)

Hi Mark,

Please forward this information to the time-keeper in order that her time off 
will be coded  correctly. An alternative would be for Carol to complete her 
timesheets before she leaves.  With SAP this can be done in advance.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks

Michele:

Just to let you know that I have approved the following for Carol:

1. In addition to the 6 weeks that Enron allows for leave, Carol will add to 
that period by using any remaining vacation time that she has for 2000 (I 
believe an additional 10-12 days).

2. After that time is used up, Carol will be on an unpaid leave of absence 
until December 31, 2000.

Please let me know if there is anything else you need.

Mark

Carol,

I am helping the Weather Desk to develop a new product (PJM Power Demand). It 
will initially be traded only internally.

I send you a presentation of the product and its description for EOL.

I think that we should schedule a time, so that we can discuss the product.

Thanks,

Claudio

Here is a summary of the 2 Snyder Agreements.  As we discussed last week, 
there is one trade (a basis swap that will expire in August 2004) that they 
want to remain under the 1194 Master.  Let me know what you want to do.

!. 1994 Agreement

cross default threshold - $10,000,000 for Snyder and $25,000,000 for us
automatic termination if bankruptcy occurs
setoff includes affiliates
collateral is LC's only
collateral threshold - credit rating matrix

		 Subject: FX/Currency Option Questions

Shari:
I am negotiating an ISDA with Dresdner Bank and I have the following 
questions concerning their mark-up of the FX/Currency Option language:

1. In the EMU Protocol language they want to add a reference to Section 6.  
I'm not sure why but wanted your thoughts on this.  Are there any 
circumstances under which we do not adopt the Protocol provisions?

2. They want to define the FX Definitions as the 1998 FX and Currency Option 
Definitions as amended and supplemented by the 1998 ISDA Euro Definitions.  
Is this okay?  What is the effect of this?  Should we change our form to do 
this?  With respect generally to the FX and Currency Option Definitions, as a 
general rule are they always incorporated by reference into the terms of any 
FX and Currency Option transaction even if it is electronically confirmed?  
They wanted to add language to that section of our form specifically stating 
this.

Thanks in advance for your help.

Carol

Everything is fine although I am really looking forward to spending more time 
out of the house.  I think that Bill and I need some space as well.  Can you 
sense that I am getting restless already?  I am really going to try hard to 
stay in contact with you and others there because I have discovered that 
talking to you and the others on the phone or by e-mail gives me a lift.  
Charles is doing well.  I am a little frustrated with the schedule that we 
are on which seems to vary from day to day but hopefully things will approach 
normalcy in a few weeks.  we met our new pediatrician this past week and we 
both really like him.  Charles checked out fine.  He had gained over a pound 
since leaving the hospital so I am happy that he appears to be getting enough 
to eat.  My parents and sister are coming around Sept. 23rd for the 
christening and I am looking forward to that.  Please mark your calendar for 
that Sunday as I think that we will have something at the house and I very 
much want you and Ric to come and meet everyone.

Alos, if people want to visit me here at the house ask them to call me.  I 
would very much like to see them if they want to stop by.

I can't believe that I actually miss work but I do.  Hopefully, in a few 
weeks I acn make some type of proposal to Mark but it is too soon now to do 
so and I'm not sure that I could fit it in.  Alos, Mark mentioned that I 
should be getting something in the mail about some stock options that I 
apparently received recently.  Could you please be on the look-out for it?  
I'm not sure whther all of the lawyers got some so please keep this quiet 
(which I know you will).

As for Bill's mother, she turns 80 this week and everyone in the family 
except Bill and I is going to Florida next weekend for a visit.  I told Bill 
that he could go but he decided not to.  We bought her some really pretty 
(and expensive) earrings which I hope she will like.  She has not yet given 
us a date for her visit and I can't figure out if we are still in the 
doghouse with her or not because we didn't let her come this past week.  I 
really don't care what she thinks because it was the right thing to do.

Well, I've got to go.  hope you had a good weekend and feel free to stop by 
for a visit.

Carol

Sandy:
Susan Bailey passed on to me your comments to the ISDA draft and I can
respond
to some but not all of such comments at this point:

1.   With respect to your Canadian securities rep, I am checking with our
counsel in Canada about whether we can use your language instaed of ours.

2.   With respect to the Options rep and the ESP rep in part %, Section (b),
I
believe that both parties need to make such reps.  The rep in Part 5
(b)(g)(ii)
is to cover the Trade Option exemption and it is different from the ESP rep
below it.

3.   With respect to the language in Part 5, Section (a), this is different
from
the setoff language.    What this is saying is that if a party has fulfilled
all
of its payment obligations and an Event of Default occurs with respect to it
(the "Defaulting Party"), the other party cannot withhold any payment that
it
owes to the Defaulting Party.  This is different from the exercise of setoff
rights.

4.   I would like to discuss with you or your legal representative the
removal
of the arbitration language as it is Enron's policy to have arbitration
apply.

5.   We would prefer to keep the Termination Currency specified in US
Dollars.

6.   Our tax group believes that we need the language in Part 3(a)(i), (ii).
Why do you want to delete it?

I look forward to hearing from you.

Here is a summary of what has been agreed to with El Paso:

Cross Default Threshold - $100,000,000 for each of us.  They want this just 
to apply at the Credit Support provider level
Guaranty Cap - $55,000,000 for each of us
Collateral Threshold - $50,000,000; Rounding at $250,000.  No minimum 
transfer amount
Setoff may possibly still be open re affiliates but I think that they will 
come around on this

Carol,

I am not sure whether I sent a copy of the insurance policy to you earlier, 
so I am attaching a copy to the note.  This policy is mostly complete and 
reflects all the exclusions that AC would include after our discussion with 
them.  I would like to set up a time with you Monday to discuss this further.

Add the first one to the ISDA status list.

For the S. Africa entity ENA legal needs to be informed of this as they 
usually deal with S. Africa. Suggest you contact Carol St. Clair as to 
whether she is happy for us to run with this if we are just going to be doing 
deals from Europe.

Thanks, Edmund

Paul

We would like to begin to establish ISDA agreements with the following 
entities:

Anglo American plc (www.angloamerican.co.uk) based in London and

Anglo American Corporation of South Africa Limited.

The annual financial statement  of Anglo American plc can be taken from the 
website above. I have asked the folks at Anglo American in Johannesburg, 
South Africa for the financials for the Anglo American Corporation.

Can you take a look at this for me please?

Thanks

Martin

Pablo:
Weather derivatives are derivative transactions that we do with 
counterparties based on temperature chnages, rainfall amounts etc.  For 
example, a counterparty (i.e., a ski lift operator) may want us to agree to 
pay them within a certain seasonal period based on  the number of days that 
the temperature exceeds a certain level.  With respect to credit derivatives, 
these are again financial transactions that we may enter into with a 
counterparty where we may agree to pay them if an entity taht they have a 
relationship with goes bankrupt.

it to this market.  Please review it so that there aren't any problems from 
the legal and image perspectives.  Carol, perhaps makes sense to send it to

Any questions please let me know.

Hi Carol. I'm really thrilled for you. How long do you plan to stay out?

Thanks Carol, I understand you are only focusing on the Online transactions, 
and all I ask from you is the clearance to do Online transactions.
Regarding Credit, Rod Nelson has been supporting us and he is leaving all the 
pending things to Paul Radous.  Last week Rod and I spoke abut this, and his 
view is a little different. He believes there could be some exposure if the 
same counterparty transacts both on-line and off-line; however, there are 
ways to limit the transactions and very probably the likelihood of that 
happening is very little.  He was going to put together an opinion froom 
their side, and I suggest we have a conference call wednesday morning....
I am traveling wednesday but reachable through my assistant Barbara. 
011-452-8-152-2404.   PLease call any time is convenient for you so we can 
discuss this matter and also talk to your counsel.
Thanks and regards.

Here is a message that I received from our counsel.  Again, I and they are

counterparties.  I will suggest to our counsel that we have a call mid next 
week involving you, me and them.  What is your availability on Wednesday?  
Alos, who from credit are you dealing with and are they aware that we 
probably will not be able to in a bankruptcy situation offset amounts owed 
with respect to the online and offline transactions?

 

Jeff:
Are there any tax issues that we need to be concerned about regarding the 
online piece of this?

requires her to be off work before her due date, this time would be coded as 
sick.  Even after delivery and still under doctors care you would code her 
sick time.  until the doctor releases her to return to work.  Once she has 
been released by the doctor Carol has the option to take time off using any 
vacation available or could take FMLA leave (if  she qualifies )  with 
supervisor approval.

Carmen, I understand that Carol will get her 4 weeks sick pay for having the 
baby and then whatever vacation she wants to take, but what does the doctor 
need to do to extend her into the 26 weeks of 90% pay.  She's already 
starting to have problems, so I'm sure she's not going to be able to return 
to work after 4 weeks.  I need details on how to address this issue.  Thanks, 
Suzanne

Carol,

Attached are the S. 420 and HR 333 as passed, respectively, by the Senate and 
the House.  As you know, the bills are prepared to go to conference, however 
Senate leadership has not yet figured out how they will organize the 
conference.

The language of interest to you is located in Title IX, Sec. 901(d), found on 
page 292 of HR 333 and on page 307 of S. 420.

Thanks,
Larry

Carol - While it never too late to suggest a change, given the political 
situation I would be hesitant to offer anything more than a "clarification".  
While I would not spend a huge amount of time on it, I suggest you examine if 
there are any changes. Depending on what happens in the Senate (now that it 
is in Democratic hands), the process can be reopened and we could have an 
opportunity to offer suggested changes (or it kill the bill all together).

Would it be too late to suggest changes to the definition of "forward

respect to the physical supply contracts that EES enters into?  I am not sure

Alicia and Trina:
Here are my thoughts on the latest drafts of the swap docs:

Put Confirm

1. Looks like some type of price protection mechanism is contemplated in the 
Master Derivatives Agreement and I'm assuming it would go into this confirm
2. In the definitions of ISDA and Equity Definitions, please add amendments 
and supplements

Harrier/Talon Schedule

1. We need to discuss footnotes 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 13
2. I think that the mechanics for putting up the LC that is described in the 
Additional Termination Event that was added as clause (iv) needs to be 
drafted somewhere to address, for example, drawing conditions, what happens 
when Enron's credit rating improves, the comment made in footnote 6 etc.

3. In Part 4, Section (a) and in all of the notice sections the notice that 
goes to the AGC of the Trading Group goes to Enron North America Corp. not 
Enron Corp. 
4. In Part 5, Section (l)(Recording) please add after the word "parties" the 
phrase "in connection with the Transactions hereunder."
5. In Part 5, Section (o) (Confidentiality), is the class of permitted 
discloses in clause (iv) too broad?


Talon/Enron Schedule

1. In Part 1, Section (h) should a carve out from the definition of 
Identified Event be the new Termination Event that was added?
2. Why is Part 5, Section (n) in this Schedule?
3. Same comments as above

Master Derivatives Agreement

1. Is the defined term Net Premiums worded right for purposes of the 
$400,000,000 limitation?  For some reason, I'm thinking that a and b should 
be reversed.

Talon Note

1. In Section 3.2, I'm not sure that the reference in the second paragraph to 
Part 5(m)(i) of the Enron Schedule applies since the setoff rights only 
benefit Enron and its affiliates.  Also,  what does it mean to refer to the 
Enron Guaranty here?

Enron Guaranty

1. In Section 4, I think that it is fair for them to request that setoff only 
apply to the Guaranteed Agreements and unless I'm missing something, I think 
we can give on that point.

That's all that I have.  Have you discussed with Ben the point that we talked 
about last week concerning the difference between the calculation of "Net 
Talon Loss" versus "Loss"?


I'm available tomorrow to talk about these points.
Carol

Hi Carol,

I saw that you posted about getting a nanny.  I've used two services, but 
only one that I can suggest.  For my last nanny, I used Morningside Nanny 
Service, or something close to that. They seemed thorough, and found us a 
wonderful person.  I've also used River Oaks Nanny, but they sent me a nut 
case.

Good luck,

Kay

Since late 1998, we have been trying to put in place a Master between ENA and 
the above counterparty.  We currently have a Master dated July 1997 between 
ECC and Pancanadian Petroleum Limited and Pancanadian wants to pretty much 
duplicate this Master.  Here are the credit terms of the late 1998 drfat that 
we sent them which I need for you to tell me are still okay:


No Credit Support Providers
Cross Default - $50,000,000 for ENA and $25,000,000 for them
Additional Event of Default - occurrence of a MAC and the failure to provide 
Perfprmance Assurance in accordnace with annex A.  MAC is defined as 
 Enron's rating going below BBB- and their Net Worth falling below 
$133,000,000 opr their Funded Debt to Net Worth being more than 1 to 1
They want to defined the "control" concept in Affiliate as ownership of more 
than 50% of equity.  This term is used in the Setoff language and limits the 
possible  entities that could be Affiliates on our side and their side
Forms of collateral are cash and LC's
Collateral Thresholds are $10,000,000 for us and $3,500,000 for them

Let me know what you think.

the date.  Please call me if you have any questions.  I will send you the

I am sure Irma has come up with a position by now, but I will give you her
name and number just in case.  It is Irma Navas, 713/838-7360.  She speaks
very limited english, so if you don't speak any Spanish that could be a bit
of a problem, although her daughter *(age 18) is bi-lingual.

If I hear of anyone else I will keep your name around.  I got my nanny thru
word of mouth -- seems like the a common way!

Ron and I discussed your comments. We don't have a problem with a 3-
business day requirement for posting cash collateral nor a 3-business day
requirement for " transfer date" interest posting.

 We have a question into our counsel (who has been out sick) on whether we
need some form of Board approval for posting collateral.

Our main concern (and the reason we would like a 10- business day time
period) is if we choose to provide credit support with a LOC, we don't have
the staffing and bank pre-arrangements to be able to put an LOC in place
within a shorter period. Since we don't currently exchange collateral,
posting a LOC would not be something we do in the normal course of business.
As such, if the need should arise, we would like to have sufficient time to
allow staff to look at our alternatives and provide the form collateral that
best suits the situation.

     Carol - Our credit person doesn't understand why the transferability
language needs to be eliminated.  It simply refers to the same ICC
publication for the transfer process that governs the letter of credit
generally.  Is there some specific concern that we can address?

Carol,

I read the assignment and reviewed our positions with Morgan and Merchant 
Energy Group of America ("MEGA").  Credit is fine with the assignment.  
However, as a result of 
MEGA assigning its trades to Morgan, our mark-to-market exposure to Morgan 
increases by approximately $27.8mm over the next 18 months.  Although we have 
agreed to post margin to each other in the past, our current Master Energy 
Purchase and Sale Agreement with Morgan does not have any STATED provisions 
for margining.  Consequently, we would like to amend the agreement to include 
collateral thresholds for both Enron and Morgan.  I will discuss this issue 
with Ed and get back to you.

Thanks,
Wendy

and someone in my group mentioned that in some cases, Enron has something

Carol,

I spoke to our in house counsel about the arbitration clause and they are
willing to leave it in.
So, to sum up here are our responses your original eMail:

1.  Canadian Securities Rep:  Please have your Canadian counsel review our
language which our outside Canadian counsel prepared.
2.  Ok.
3.  We're ok with this now.
4.  We're ok to leave this in.
5.  Ok.
6.  Please see my comments below.

Thanks,

Also they have asked that we obtain the proper mailing address and contact

Plese let me know if there is a problem with this requested change.

Sandy:
Susan Bailey passed on to me your comments to the ISDA draft and I can
respond
to some but not all of such comments at this point:

1.   With respect to your Canadian securities rep, I am checking with our
counsel in Canada about whether we can use your language instaed of ours.

2.   With respect to the Options rep and the ESP rep in part %, Section
(b),
I
believe that both parties need to make such reps.  The rep in Part 5
(b)(g)(ii)
is to cover the Trade Option exemption and it is different from the ESP rep
below it.

3.   With respect to the language in Part 5, Section (a), this is different
from
the setoff language.    What this is saying is that if a party has
fulfilled
all
of its payment obligations and an Event of Default occurs with respect to
it
(the "Defaulting Party"), the other party cannot withhold any payment that
it
owes to the Defaulting Party.  This is different from the exercise of
setoff
rights.

4.   I would like to discuss with you or your legal representative the
removal
of the arbitration language as it is Enron's policy to have arbitration
apply.

5.   We would prefer to keep the Termination Currency specified in US
Dollars.

6.   Our tax group believes that we need the language in Part 3(a)(i),
(ii).
Why do you want to delete it?

I look forward to hearing from you.

We have received a request from the above counterparty to alter the format of 
the confirmation process on physical and financial deals.  In lieu of signing 
each confirm that is sent to them, what they want to send back to us is a 
letter signed by them in which they describe the confirm and indicate whether 
or not they accept or disagree with the terms thereof and if they disagree 
with such terms, they will return the confirm.  Are you okay with this

Where does EPMI fit in if we are doing a financial power swap?  Who are the 
Enron entities that are involved and what contracts are currently in place 
with the Kaiser entities?  Are we netting overall exposures and using one 
collateral threshold?  Are we cross defaulting all of the contracts?  What 
exactly do you want to accomplish with the netting agreement?

		 Subject: Kaiser US/UK Setoff w/MG and ENA

Carol,

West power is looking to do a financial swap with Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical 
Corporation ("Kaiser Aluminum") whereby Kaiser Aluminium would buy the swap 
and pay ENA float.  Kaiser Aluminum International Inc. ("Kaiser 
International") has a big market presence in the UK and MG has significant 
forward financial and physical metals positions with Kaiser International 
which I believe are quite out-of-the-money.

Can we find out whether or not we can perform a bilateral, affiliate NETTING 
AGREEMENT between Kaiser International and Kaiser Aluminum with MG and EPMI?  
If the UK is going to continue to do short-term new metals business with 
Kaiser International and if we can get comfortable with metals forward 
positions that are OTM, we would like to use this position and leverage off 
of it for trading liquidity in the states.  Secondly, does the netting need 
to just pertain to global financial business or can it include physical as 
well?

If possible, I'd like to see if you and a UK trading attorney can speak about 
the overall concept and briefly address any UK and domestic law conflicts.  
Please call when you have a opportunity to discuss.  ENA is looking to enter 
into a power swap for June '01.  I'm not sure if this concept is achievable, 
and if it is, in the time frame we're facing.  However, if we can't do a June 
swap, then we'll try for a July swap.

Regards,
Tracy

We have contacted Merrill Lynch Captial Services to retrieve our outstanding

They have indicated that they want the fixed price (nymex) language changed 
to reflect
"floating" price language and wants all deals which we are confirming changed

and refaxed to them.

Please advise,

Ana:
I just got to open this up now.  Thanks for sending this and the card.  What 
a week it has been.  I'm happy to report that we are all home now and except 
for a lack of sleep, we are all doing well.  I ended up having Charles Eugene 
by C-section and then had to spend the next 5 days in the hospital while they 
tried to figure out why he was breathing erratically.  They ran all sorts of 
tests on him (including a spinal tap) and the good news is that he just had 
some fluid in his lungs which he didn't get rid of as part of the birthing 
process.  He is okay now and a true joy!  Arthur and Bill have been a big 
help.  It's nice to have someone around with me during the day.  Arthur 
visited my parents right before Charles was born and had a great time.  They 
spoiled him to death but I was thrilled that he made the trip there and 
wished we could do that more often.  As for me, I hope to take from now until 
the end of the year off from work and then decide what I want to do.  I'm 
looking forward to the extended leave even though most of it will be unpaid 
but it will be worth it and hopefully Charles will benefit from it.

How are things with you?  Have you seen the shore house?  It is quite a 
place.  I'm hoping that mom and sue will come for a visit in late August.  
Sue is Charles' godmother.

Well I need to get back to the baby.  stay in touch and thanks again for 
thinking of us.  Pictures will come soon.  Love, Carol

Dear  Carol, Bill, and Arthur...

Have been thinking of you and the impending "arrival" in a big way, these
days...and as a result, wrote a little poem concerning him....and you....here
goes....

                       TO THE CHILD
    You're coming soon, little one
       To fill their lives with love and fun
        and hope, and joy...
        Their second son.....
         You lucky, lucky boy!

                        TO THE PARENTS
            This gift from 'God
             is making his debut...
             In just a few days
              he's coming to you
              To be loved,
               to be fed,
                to be put to bed
                 with music and lullabies
                  and kisses when he cries....

                                    TO HIS BROTHER

                   You will help him
                     as he grows,
                    And love and protect him,
                     Heaven knows!
                     And there'll be no other
                      like his big brother!

                                      TO THE FAMILY AS ONE

                      So love him lots
                       with all your heart..
                       And help him
                        as he makes his start
                        into this world
                         so very strange
                         with every day,

Tanya:
When the Columbia purchase was done in January, did the 1/30/98 ISDA Master 
between ENA and Columbia Energy Services Corporation stay with Columbia or 
come over to us?  The reason that I am asking is that they have sent ENA a 
letter notifying us of Columbia's transfer of its rights under such Master to 
The New Power Company, so it seems as if they believe that that Master was 
not part of our acquisition.  Who in credit needs to be aware of this if in 
fact this Master will be assigned to New Power?

=09=09=20
=09=09 To: All Enron Worldwide
=09=09 cc:=20
=09=09 Subject: Organizational Changes

We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change=
s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=
=20
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit=
y=20
for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=
orth=20
America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=
=20
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=
he=20
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=
=20
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=
=20
will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =
of=20
the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=
ness=20
into Enron Global Assets in the near future.
=20
Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined=
=20
EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi=
ll=20
focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to=
=20
the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE=
S=20
to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or=
der=20
to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20
facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for=
=20
at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout=
h=20
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=
=20
businesses and the commercial support functions:

Enron Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=
 and=20
CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20

Enron Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for=
=20
operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20
marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=
t=20
into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility=
=20
for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20
Americas.

Enron Europe
The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust=
ralia=20
and Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=
=20
Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.

Enron Global Markets
Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=
=20
CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20
responsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20
exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20
associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to=
=20
Enron Global Assets.  Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the=
=20
commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20
equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM=
ahon,=20
President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=
y,=20
the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in=
=20
the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=
=20
efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=
=20
EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These=
=20
newly defined roles are as follows:

Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=
e=20
Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works,=
=20
with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20
President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat=
ed=20
services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these=
=20
services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=
=20
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=
=20
for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.
Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.
Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =
on a=20
regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in=
=20
the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all=
=20
European and Eastern Hemisphere operations.  Rick and Mark will also contin=
ue=20
to support all other Enron businesses operating in their respective regions=
=20
and will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chi=
ef=20
of Staff.
Public Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a region=
al=20
basis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity,=20
Enron Net Works, and Enron Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue=
=20
in her role for Enron Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble=
r=20
will have responsibility for activity outside North America and Europe as=
=20
well as providing support for Enron Global Markets and Enron Global Assets.=
 =20
These individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship=
=20
to Mark Palmer, Vice President of Communications.
Business Analysis and Reporting =01) Wes Colwell will expand his role to co=
ver=20
EWS reporting in addition to his current role in North America.

Attached for your review is an organization chart for Enron Wholesale=20
Services which summarizes the changes described here.  As this organization=
=20
continues to evolve we will keep you informed of any additional changes.

ENRON GLOBAL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION
AND ENRON WIND

 As part of our company-wide initiative to examine our assets and investmen=
ts=20
around the world, we are considering a variety of options with respect to=
=20
EGEP and EWC.  As a consequence, we are putting these businesses under Clif=
f=20
Baxter=01,s direction.  Jeff Sherrick, CEO of EGEP, and Jim Noles, CEO of E=
nron=20
Wind, will report to Cliff.

CORPORATE STAFF

 We are consolidating the corporate staff functions: Human Resources,=20
Government Affairs, Public Relations/Communications and Administration.  In=
=20
that regard, Cindy Olson, Executive Vice President of Human Resources and=
=20
Community Relations, will report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President an=
d=20
Chief of Staff.

COMMITTEE STRUCTURE

 In light of the increased leadership opportunities created by Enron=01,s=
=20
growth, the Executive Committee will be expanded to include more of our=20
business unit leaders.  The primary role of this committee will continue to=
=20
be the communication of relevant information across Enron=01,s businesses a=
nd=20
the coordination of activities across those businesses.  We will also be=20
drawing on this group to lead company-wide initiatives such as the=20
performance review process and evaluation and creation of new businesses. =
=20
The Executive Committee membership is shown on the attached list.

 We are also forming a new committee =01) the Enron Corporate Policy Commit=
tee. =20
This group will be responsible for overall corporate policy, personnel=20
management policy and corporate strategy.  The Enron Corporate Policy=20
Committee membership is also shown on the attached list.

 We are confident that these changes will align our talent and our capital =
to=20
our highest return opportunities.  Please join us in congratulating and=20
supporting all of these individuals in their new roles.

I don't like specifying a time period for termination. I remember we had a 
lengthy discussion on this with Mark Taylor. I seem to recall that the 
solution was that we would employ resonable efforts to process the 
termination request (please confirm with Mark). I don't think they will be 
happy with three days.

Subject: kennecott

David:
Here is a draft of the ETA amendment letter that we have been discussing with 
Kennecott.  It includes my proposed modifications to deal with giving them 
the termination right which I have highlighted.  The current ETA states that 
all notices become effective immediately.  I have inserted in my language a 3 
day period after we receive a termination notice before it becomes 
effective.  This creates a difference between Us and our Counterparty's since 
our termination notice would become effective immediately.  What do you 
think?  Do we need this 3 day period or are you okay with having their 
termination notice becoming effective on the date of our receipt?
Carol

I spoke with Lech about the Article 9 questions.  He is going to send me some 
articles that they have written which I will send to you.    He alos 
confirmed that the cash perfection issue has not changed  under new Article 9 
although his view on it was that this type of collateral under the UCC is 
more like a deposit account than "money" which, under common law principles,  
gets perfected through the exercise of dominion and control over the cash.  
Under the new Article 9, deposit accounts are covered and the new Article 9 
codifies the common law control test.  e alos expressed a view that It may 
take longer than July 1st for NY to adopt the new Article 9.

Here is what their letter should say to us:

Reference is made to the Guaranty Agreement dated as of September 1, 1998 
from American Central Gas Companies, Inc. ("Guarantor") for the benefit of 
Enron North America Corp. ("Enron").  By letter addressed to you dated April 
6, 2000 (the "Termination Letter"), Guarantor terminated its obligations 
under the Guaranty.  The purpose of this letter is to notify Enron that such 
Termination Letter is null and void such that no termination of the Guaranty 
by Guarantor has occurred.  In addition, Guarantor hereby agrees to amend the 
Guaranty by (1) changing the amount set forth in Section 1(b) from $1,000,000 
to $2,000,000 and (2) by changing the text of the fourth paragraph in Section 
6 to read as follows:  "This Guaranty shall terminate on the date (such date 
being the "Termination Date") that is the earlier of (a) July __, 2000 or (b) 
the effective date of any written notice of termination sent by Guarantor as 
set forth below.   Guarantor may terminate this Guaranty by providing written 
notice of such termination to ECT and upon the effectiveness of such 
termination, Guarantor shall have no further liability hereunder, except as 
provided in the last sentence of this paragraph.  No such termination by 
Guarantor shall be effective until five (5) days after receipt by ECT of such 
termination notice.  No termination of this Guaranty pursuant to the 
provisions of this paragraph shall affect Guarantor's liability with respect 
to any Transaction (as defined in the Contracts) entered into prior to the 
Termination Date, which Transaction shall remain guaranteed pursuant to the 
terms of this Guaranty."

Please acknowledge your acceptance of the terms of this letter, by signing in 
the space provided below.

I have sent your responses to Stacy Dickson and Jeff Hodge so that they can 
verify the physical questions.  With respect to question #3, I would alos 
state that until the Master is executed, all of those trades will be governed 
by the online GTC.  Also, to the extent that Cargill traded with Enron Canada 
on a financial basis, those trades would alos be confirmed under the Master 
as it is my understanding taht we do not do separate Masters with the same 
counterparty for ENA and ECC.

Adele:
Here are my thoughts on the latest drafts of the ISDA and CSA Schedules that 
you sent to me:

1. In Part 1, Section (e) of the ISDA Schedule, right after the definition of 
PSE&G Reorganization Transaction you need to delete "S&P".  I also need to 
see what you are planning to put on Annex C.

2. I am checking with my credit person regarding the language that you added 
to Part 5, Section (h) - Transfer.

3. In the CSA, I thought that both threshold amounts were to be at 
$7,500,000.  In addition, in the proviso after threshold, the term "Specified 
Condition" should be changed to "Material Adverse Change".  A Mac would be 
triggered if Credit Ratings were below BBB-.

4. In Paragraph 13, Section (e), if the only types of collateral are cash or 
LC's why is consent required to substitute?

5. I would like to discuss with you our proposed Insert 4 to Paragraph 13, 
Section (h)(iii).

6. In Paragraph 13, Section (j)(ii)(2), why was the last sentence deleted?

7. I need to discuss with you just a few issues on the LC provisions.  I will 
send you a mark-up with my thoughts and questions.

Hopefully we can get this resolved next week.  Tuesday through Thursday of 
next week work best for me. I will fax to you a mark-up with my nits and 
comments on the lC language.

The Master only covers financial so I assumed that we were just dealing with 
financial trades.  Should we be covering physical?  If so, it may be best to 
handle that in a separate letter.

Hi Carol.  I will review the comments promptly (I've been on vacation so
any delay was fine by me).  Regarding the cross-default, I will need to
discuss it internally, and get approvals, but the collateral provision is
not a core policy so we will certainly think about it.  In any event, now
that we're getting close, I think it may be a good to have another
converstation to discuss where we are on the remaining issues. Please let
me know your availability.

Thanks and regards,

Steve

Original Message from Carol.St.Clair@enron.com @ HUB on 06/19:





Steve:
I am faxing you our remaining comments to the schedules.  Looks like the
only
open points relate to :

1.   the additional cross-default language.  Have you had a chance to think
about what I e-mailed to you?

2.   DB, pursuant to our request, is considering refining the "materially
weaker" standard in Credit Event Upon Merger to specify a ratings test.

3.   Insertion of our Rider 7 into the ISDA Schedule regarding confirmation
procedures.

4.   DB reviewing LC language and our comments to the Enron Guaranty.  I
guess
we still need to discuss the :defenses" language because as I indicated to
you,
I'm not sure that your compromise works for us.

I look forward to hearing from you and sorry for the delay.

 Carol -- I came across this message from Sarah Duckers last night as
I was cleaning out my e-mails.  I don't know if you have found a nanny yet
or if Sarah's fill-in nanny is still available but I thought I would pass
this on just in case.  Hope all is well.

Ed:
We are really close on finalizing the EEI.  The following are open credit 
points with them:

1. They want their cross default to be $100 million too instead of $50.

2. They want to exclude from the affiliate definition Florida Power & Light 
and its subs.  Their lawyer is sending me a list.

3. They want to raise both collateral thresholds from $20 to $50 million.

4. In the assignment language in section 10.5,  they want to specify a 
creditworthiness test in clauses (ii) and (iii), such that if the assignee or 
its guarantor is rated BBB- or Baa3, the assignment is permitted.  Clauses 
(ii) and (iii) relate to assignments to affiliates and assignments that occur 
as a result of mergers or asset transfers.  Right now the test is a generic 
creditworthiness test.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Russell:
Here are the credit related comments that Pancanadian Energy Services Inc. 
made 

1. They want the definition of Specified Indebtedness to exclude obligations 
with Affiliates.  This is how it is defined in the Canadian Master.

2. They want a Minimum Transfer Amount for each of us of $100,000.

3. They want rounding to be reduced to $100,000 for each of us.

4. In the definition of Letter of Credit, they want the LC Bank to either be 
a major US or Canadian Bank, but not a foreign bank with a US branch office.

5. In the definition of Material Adverse Change, they want to delete the 
Current assets/Current Liabilities ratio trigger.

Thanks for the update.  Based on the marketing information that you received
from us yesterday, are there any restrictions on our folks in Mexico going
forward with their marketing efforts?  If so, please advise.  Prior to 
receiving
you written advice, would it be possible to schedule a call maybe on Wednesday
of next week with myself and Jaime so that we can at least outline any 
potential
online issues, both in connection with our marketing efforts and in connection
with the online documents that you are reviewing? I am available anytime after
2:30 (Houston time) on Wednesday and I am wide open on Thursday.

Dear Carol -

Enclosed are drafts of (i) the ISDA schedule, (ii) Paragraph 13 to the
Credit Support Annex, and (iii) our standard guarantee.   Also included is a
draft what should be in the L/C and Schedule 1 of a Stby L/C.

Please note that I have accepted most of the previous changes so the current
issues would more easily be seen in the draft.

Comments concerning the schedule and para 13 are below:  Note - our legal
council is out this week but I thought I would send this draft to you now,
and we can make further adjustments, if any, based on our legal department
review next week.

1.  Part 1 (e):  After Charles Hofer spoke with your Credit Manager, Brant
Reves, they decided to make the cross default threshold at $100MM for each
credit support provider.
2.  1(h):  Made change per our phone conversation that Market Quotation will
apply for 3 years or less; Loss for over 3 years.
3.  5(g):  I am confused by this change.  I added back in the word
"obligations" in para B, 5th line and added back in the phrase concerning
affiliates.  I'm not sure my predecessor deleted them (it is not deleted on
my 3/20/00 draft) but I can't imagine who else would.  Two comments (i) do
you think this is best way to word this, and (2) my legal council (who is
out most of this week) will have to review your final wording before we can
execute.
4.  5(l):  Changed the telephone recording paragraph by (a) not limiting it
to just trading staff and (b) adding "to the extent permitted by applicable
law".
5.  5(n-q):  All new paragraphs that are not part of our standard agreement.
However, these were not discussed in Susan's last memo to you (except the
adding back in of paragraph q) so I am leaving them as is.
6.  Part 6:  After reviewing your changes vs. our standard paragraphs, I
have no objections to your changes
7.  13(b)(i)(C) Accepted your definition of Credit Support Amount even
though we don't normally use Independent Amounts.
8.  13(b)(iii)(A)  Letters of Credit - changes days to 20 from 10, per your
request.  After re-reading, I don't understand how it improves the position
of the secured party.  If the L/C has an expiration date and the secured
party attempts to execute (i.e.: cash in) this L/C, then if the L/C is
within 20 days of its expiration, the value can drop to zero.  Before, the
L/C maintained 100% of its value until 10 days prior to expiration.  Since
Enron looks at these contracts from the secured party perspective, how does
your position improve based on this change?
8.  13(b)(iii)(B and C) Threshold for both of us has been increased to $50MM
and Minimum Transfer Amount has been reduced to zero ($0).

For questions, please call at 713-420-3548 or email me.

Thanks!

John

My comments on the Master Steel Agreement are as follows:

1.   Section 3.7 - The Taxes arising at the Delivery Point should be the=20

=20
Master Agreement arising upstream of the Delivery Point and Buyer should be=
=20
responsible for all Taxes applicable to the Commodity being sold under the=
=20
Master Agreement arising at and downstream of the Delivery Point).

2.   Section 3.7 - The phrase "within [___] days" should be added immediate=
ly=20
before the comma in the sentence beginning "[i]f Buyer and Seller are unabl=
e=20
to reach mutual agreement...."

3.   Section 3.7 - The following sentence should be inserted before the=20
sentence beginning "If either party is exempt from Taxes...":

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party is not liable for any applicable Tax=
es=20
that are legally imposed on the other Party and that are refundable to the=
=20
other Party, including without limitation value added or goods and services=
=20
taxes.

4.   Section 9 - The following sentence should be added to the definition o=
f=20
Delivery Point:

For purposes of  transactions involving an Option on the Commodity, the=20
Delivery Point shall be defined to mean the date of delivery to the Buyer o=
f=20
written confirmation of the purchase and sale of the Option, which date sha=
ll=20
be in all cases not earlier than one day following the day of acceptance of=
=20
the Counterparty=01,s offer.

5.   Section 9 - The phrase "goods and services taxes," should be added to=
=20
the definition of New Taxes immediately after the phrase "value added taxes=

6.   Section 9 - The words "value added, goods and services," should be add=

Please let me know if you have any questions or need any additional=20

Shari:
I am negotiating an ISDA with Dresdner Bank and I have the following 
questions concerning their mark-up of the FX/Currency Option language:

1. In the EMU Protocol language they want to add a reference to Section 6.  
I'm not sure why but wanted your thoughts on this.  Are there any 
circumstances under which we do not adopt the Protocol provisions?

2. They want to define the FX Definitions as the 1998 FX and Currency Option 
Definitions as amended and supplemented by the 1998 ISDA Euro Definitions.  
Is this okay?  What is the effect of this?  Should we change our form to do 
this?  With respect generally to the FX and Currency Option Definitions, as a 
general rule are they always incorporated by reference into the terms of any 
FX and Currency Option transaction even if it is electronically confirmed?  
They wanted to add language to that section of our form specifically stating 
this.

Thanks in advance for your help.

Carol

I have never had one executed.  Here are the forms of Annexes that I have 
used, 1 with the PSA Form (Chase 1/29/98) and the other with the ISMA form.  
Also I'm sending you some questions that I have asked Kinneman et al in the 
past.

Can you give me an idea of where things stand on the Transfer Agreement?  I 
think that we were just waiting for you to get signed up correctly on Enron 
Online.  I will be going on maternity leave shortly and just wanted to figure

Could we get together for lunch sometime soon so you can update me on what 
has been happening at the office?  Let me know which dates work best for you 
in the next few weeks.  My mother in law is coming for a visit next week so 
can we shoot for sometime the week of November 6th?  Look forward to hearing 
from you.  Charles is doing great.  Growing like a weed and becoming more 
interactive with us.  While I miss the office routine, I am really enjoying 
my time away from the office.

Ed:
We are really close on finalizing the EEI.  The following are open credit 
points with them:

1. They want their cross default to be $100 million too instead of $50.

2. They want to exclude from the affiliate definition Florida Power & Light 
and its subs.  Their lawyer is sending me a list.

3. They want to raise both collateral thresholds from $20 to $50 million.

4. In the assignment language in section 10.5,  they want to specify a 
creditworthiness test in clauses (ii) and (iii), such that if the assignee or 
its guarantor is rated BBB- or Baa3, the assignment is permitted.  Clauses 
(ii) and (iii) relate to assignments to affiliates and assignments that occur 
as a result of mergers or asset transfers.  Right now the test is a generic 
creditworthiness test.

I look forward to hearing from you.

     Frank,

     To follow up on our conversation earlier this week I'd like to confirm
     my understanding of how the terms on Enron-online will work.

     1.Enron-online is a medium for executing a transaction with Enron...an
     electronic method just as phone is a verbal method

  Yes    

 2.Financial trades in North American will be traded with Enron North
      America.
      Physical trades in US will be with Enron NA other than in Texas where
      is will be Houston Pipeline Company(please can you clarify this aspect
      for gas moving out of Texas on interstate pipelines)
      Physical trades in Canada will be with Enron Canada

 The first sentence is correct.  Physical NATURAL GAS trades in US will be 
with Enron North America for locations  outside of Texas and Houston Pipeline 
Company for locations within Texas.  Physical NATURAL GAS trades in Canada  
can be with either Enron North America or Enron Canada Corp, depending on the 
location.

     3.All financial deals will be governed by the cargill/Enron ISDA
     agreement presently being negotiated


 Once executed, the ISDA signed be Cargill and Enron will govern any 
financial trades entered into by the   entities that signed this agreement.



     4.Physical deals will be governed by the executed GISB agreement in
     place
 
 Physical NATURAL GAS deals, entered into by the entities that executed a 
GISB agreement, will be governed by  said agreement. 


     5.Cargill will need to have two accounts to differentiate Cargill Inc
     from Cargill Canada

 Yes
 

     Given the above summary, Cargill will look to set up two accounts as
     per (5) above, to commence trading with Enron-online.

     If you have any comments on above or can speed the setting up of our
     accounts, please feel free to e.mail me back today

     Regards

     Alastair Riach - Trading manager Natural Gas

I think that Tana is right.  I guess that if we do a telephone trade and use 
the ECC Canada Annex A then we need to make the same modifications to that.  
Is that correct?  Have they requested any modifications to the online GTC?

Carol,

We've had some issues lately with EnronOnline deals and Puget Sound.  Should 
this entity always be booked with ECC?  Currently, depending on the index 
traded, it downloads into Trade Capture as either ENA or ECC.  In speaking 
with Tana the other day we had decided that whichever Enron entity downloads 
is the one we should confirm the deal under.

thanks,
Joe

Here are my comments to the form of Guranty:

1. I thought that this Guaranty would only cover the Engage US Agreement.

2. What cap number do you plan to insert in Section 1(c)?  I'm assuming $10M 
if the Guaranty only covers Engage US.

3. In Section 6, there should be no restriction on our ability to assign our

Attached is the standard Coastal guaranty form we use for ISDAs.? I 
understand this ISDA is just for these financial instruments and not for the 
physical side of the business.? Please give me your comments, if any.

We will split the guaranty with a Coastal guaranty for Engage US and 
Westcoast for Engage Canada.?? Since the new threshold is $10 million, the 
Coastal guaranty cap is $10 million.?

Sara and I met with Richard Sanders today to resolve some questions that we 
had concerning the arbitration and process agent language in our forms and 
here is what we concluded needed to be done:

1. If arbitration is chosen, there is no need to insert Waiver of Jury Trial 
language

2. Pending discussions that he will be having with Mark Haedicke and Jim 
Derrick, no chnages need to be made to our arbitration language.

3. Our Process Agent language will be revised such that under all 
circumstances it will say the following:

Party A appoints as its Process Agent , ____________, having an office in 
________________ on the date of this Agreement at __________________.  Party 
B appoints as its Process Agent, __________________, having an office in 
_______________ on the date of this Agreement at ______________.


Susan Bailey,
Could you please get from our corporate secretary's office the information 
that we need to fill in the blanks for ENA and ECC?

If you have any questions, please call me or Sara.

club that we belong to and they are alot of fun.  Feel free to stop by some 
time this weekend if you are in the neighborhood.  We will be around most of

Hi Carol, I have your paycheck here, but nothing else.  Do you want me to 
just send it alone or wait. I know you have it automatically deposited.  Did 
you get the picture ok?  How did you like it?  Ric bought me one while we 
were in CA (not like yours, but a limited edition).  Those puppies cost 
$250!  That was a nice deal toy.

How's everything going?  We had a great time in CA, ate and drank our way 
through the wine country.  That's about all my news.

You did get my thank you note for my birthday present didn't you?  Thanks 
again!

Carol,

For your review, I've attached the adjustments our legal department is
proposing to the Consent to Assignment since receiving your red-lined
version from Rhonda Denton.  As to the transfer effective date, since we are
now into June, we would expect the transfer date to be as of July 1st.
Please let me know as soon as possible your comments on MEGA's most recent
proposed Consent to Assignment (attached below).

Carol -

Our legal department is in the process of reviewing the schedule, paragraph
13, and L/C provisions/schedule.  I will send you new drafts once I
incorporate comments from them. Two other things:
1.  Enclosed is a "new" format of Guarantee for your review.  Actually, this
should be similar to the 1995/6 version Enron has already accepted.
2.  I disagree with your changes in C/D threshold discussed below.   We
prefer to limit this to the Credit Support Provider (as per your original
change) as this is who guarantees the ISDA.  I have incorporated your
original comments with little change which you can review when I send the
drafts.

As long as our omission by way of (for example) not having high enough 
security is not enough to impact the liability clause, then I guess I am OK 
with this - but I'd be happier if it did not include "omission"

i.e. If we are stupid and hurt ourselves, then shame on us, but if we simply 
do not take some action and thereby fail to prevent the Counterparty from 
inflicting damage on us, then that is something different.

Thoughts?

Dave

Subject: Re: GPU Energy Amendment Letter  

Dave:
1. Are you referring to the paragraph where I have a blank?  If so, this is 
part of Leslie Hansen's issue which she and Mark have discussed and I wasn't 
sure when I drafted this who our counterparty would be.

2. With respect to Paragraph 4, all we are doing is saying that their 
indemnity to us does not  cover losses that we incur as a result of our own 
acts.  This is a crave out that we have given in the past to those that I 
have requested it and it seems to us a fair compromise given the one-sided 
nature of the indemnity language.

Couple of questions:

- What is the intention of the first paragraph?
- So, does Paragraph 4 roughly translate to: "Counterparty is allowed to 
whack us if we don't have high enough security"?

Keith:
I am okay with the arbitration and non-exclusive jurisdiction language as 
currently written as I understand that these concepts were previously agreed 
to between you and Mary.  Here is my understanding of the remaining open 
issues:

1. Whther termination is automatic or elective on bankruptcy.  You are 
considering our request to make it elective.

2. Loss vs. Market Quotation.  We are considering whther we can accept your 
proposed language.

3. Time period for posting collateral.  You are considering how long you need.

4. Cash collateral.    I am checking with our office in Canada about this.

5. MAC clause - you are considering whther this should be an Additional 
Termination Event with the ability to cure by posting collateral or an event 
that reduces the collateral threshold to zero.

6. Default rate definition -  Ed is considering what we can accept in lieu of 
the ISDA definition.

7. No Fault Termination - we are considering whether we can accept this.

8. Credit thresholds and Rounding amounts - you and Ed to discuss.

9. Acceptable LC Issuers - Ed to consider whther limiting it to US and 
Schedule 1Canadian banks with a certain credit rating is sufficient with 
language that the parties can agree to add foreign banks.

Let me know if I misstated and of the above issues.  Thanks.

Ed-

Please see attached changes to the LOC Formats proposed by Enron.  I have
revised the draw language and expiration date language to reflect the
changes we agreed to last week.

In addition, I have inserted a paragraph at the end of the LOC form to
reflect a change requested by the bank.  It relates to the ability to
transfer the LOC.  Also attached is the form of transfer statement that the
bank will require if Enron chooses to transfer the LOC to another party.
It looks relatively straight forward and I believe it should be acceptable
to you.

Please review these changes and if acceptable, we can proceed with
execution of the documents.

The owner of the following website:   www.weatherrisk.com   has offered to 
sell the site to us.  We currently own www.weather-risk.com and would like to 
get rid of the "-" if we could.  We have tentatively negotiated a price of 
$15,000 for this site.  I would like to sit down with you to discuss our next 
steps, concerns, issues, etc... at your earliest convenience.

Please call me to discuss this or to schedule time.

Here is where I understand we are with the LOC provisions and the LC for.  


1. No changes will be made to the LOC provisions.

2. In the form of LOC, i will delete the language in drawing condition 1 "the 
entire undrawn amount of the LOC" and put in "$___________."  I will alos 
delete the automatic renewal language in the third paragraph such that it 
will read "This LOC shall expire _____ days from the date of issuance."

Are we ready to finalize?  If so, I will e-mail to you final forms of the 
docs.

Carol - I have reviewed the changes in both forms attached.  In the LOC, I 
think that they are getting at the point to allow for partial drawings and 
requesting to reduce the auto renewal notice clause to 30 days from 90 days.  
Seems okay to me.  The proposed changes in the Letter of Credit Provisions, 
please ignore.  I have discussed this with them and they have come off it.

We received an email from your attorney about the LOC format for the two
contracts.  Our legal counsel has reviewed the format and the provisions
for the LOC and we have two proposed changes to the LOC format and one
proposed change to the Letter of Credit Provisions.  Please call me to
discuss these issues.

Rod:
I found my file and here is where things stand:

1. On cross default threshold, they wanted it to be the same as the 
collateral threshold but my notes indicate that they were okay leaving it at 
$100,000.

2. In lieu of receiving financials from them, we had agreed to accept 
quarterly and annual Lease Operating Statements.  Did I use the correct 
term?  Do we need a definition for this or is it understood what these 
statements are?  I am also assuming that they are internally prepared.  Is 
that correct?  My notes indicate that these would be provided within 90 days 
after quarter end.

3. We agreed to a collateral threshold for them of $500,000.

4.  For the MAC trigger, is the only test the Net Cash Flow/Revenue test and 
if so, what would trigger the MAC?  Are there other triggers?  We used to 
have Funded Debt/Partners Capital, EBITDA Coverage Ratio and Minimum Partners 
Capital tests.  Alos, here are my proposed definitions:

Cash Flow means Net Income plus depreciation and non-cash charges minus 
capital expenditures as shown on the income statement.

Net Income means gross revenues and other proper income credits, less all 
proper income charges, including taxes on income.

Revenue is cash received from the sale of oil, gas and plant products. 

Should there be references to the Lease Operating Statements in these 
definitions?

5. All Performance Assurance would be rounded up to multiples of $10,000.

This is all that I have.  Let me know what you think.

Carol

Smith/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 
Subject: Re: EnronOnline

Carol, 

we have one remaining issue outstanding with United Energy on the ETA. They 
are still insisting on a exclusion of "consequential losses" from the 
indemnity given clause 4(a) of the ETA. Two questions 
Do we have a position on agreeing to exclude consquential losses from this 
clause? My own view is in this instance it is going to be somewhat "hit and 
miss" as what would be a consequential loss and what is not. That being said 
the general Enron position is to exclude consequential losses. In fact such a 
provision is already in the GTCs in respect of any Transaction.  Hence if 
there was a Transaction consequentiallossess would then presumably be 
excluded in respect of a related breach of the ETA.  
Utilicorp is a substantial equity holder in United Energy. I understand they 
are trading through EnronOnline. Do we know what they have agreed?

Subject: Re: EnronOnline  

Peggy further my previous email. Two additional points;

I believe it is best for us  to move to replace the Deemed ISDA Agreement. 
This will provide a cleaner contractual basis for EnronOnline trades. We 
should be able to settle a  ISDA  Master Agreement quite swiftly  using the 
existing commmercial terms in the Deemed ISDA. If you are concur with this 
course of action we will forward to you tomorrow  a Schedule  for  review.  
In respect of Section 4(b) of the ETA we would be agreeable to add the 
following at its end:  "unless such access, entry, omission or action arises 
from acts or omissions of Enron and its directors, officers, employees, 
agents or contractors.''

cc: Paul Smith/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 

Subject: Re: EnronOnline  

Peggy my apologies for not replying sooner but I was overseas.  Let me 
respond to the points you raised.

Deemed ISDA Agreement- We would be most happy to provide a letter that you 
could aknowledge that the Deemed ISDA Agreement is a master agreement for the 
purposes of the ETA. I would prefer not to make a formal amendment as this 
may exclude a subsequent Master Agreement from applying.
Enron Australia Finance Pty Ltd. is the Enron counterparty for all Australian 
power trades. If that is your preference then access can be limited to only 
those products. You could write to us stating this is your position. However, 
we have found that counterparties have not found this necessary. Your 
EnronOnline Master User will set access levels for your individual traders. 
Many counterparties appoint a person from their Controls group (not a Trader) 
as their Master User.   This gives them the flexibility to broaden/ reduce 
access themselves.
Excluding "consequential loss" in this circumstance is quite broad but if we 
could work through some scenarios hopefully we could find some words to 
accomodate your concerns.
When we last spoke you mentioned the concern here was the possibility that  
the password may be disclosed from other than a UE source ie Enron. I have 
talked this issue through with our systems people as to the nature of this 
exposure. What happens is that the password which is issued to a user is 
immediately changed after it is received from Enron. Hence the source of the 
password must be the relevant counterparty. Whether improper use is a result 
of the counterparty's negilence or some other cause such as an unauthorised 
use or disclosure by one of its personnel is not relevant. What is of concern 
that the loss would have resulted from or arose out of a Counterparty's 
"access to or utilisation of the Website".    

Perhaps you would give me a call so we may discuss any outstanding points.

David

Further to our conversation this week regarding our outstanding issues in
the Electronic Trading Agreement, UE suggests the following way foreward.

Enron sends a letter to UE to be countersigned.  This letter covers the
following:

* it is a variation to the ETA;
* all Transactions entered through EnronOnline will be covered by the
Deemed ISDA Master Agreement signed between UE and Enron Australia Finance
and dated 8th Feb 1999;
* Transactions at this stage will only be between UE and Enron
Australia Finance;
* amend clause 4(b) to exclude indemnification against consequential
loss;
* amend clause 4(b)(ii) of the ETA to remove the wording "whether or
not Counterparty has authorized such access" and provide appropriate
replacement wording that ensures UE is only liable where access is obtained
through UE's negligence.

Please let me know if Enron would agree to this.

Regards
Peggy

Russell:
Our confirms desk has informed me that Aquila Risk Management has not been 
executing confirmations that are sent to them and apparently the reason for 
this was that they ere waiting for the Utilicorp Master to be put in place.  
Now that we have completed the Master, is there some way that we can get 
these confirms executed?  I will send you a list of deals shortly, but I'm 
assuming that given the language that we have in the Master that there should 
be no problem in signing the existing confirms that reference the existing 
Aquila Master.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Carol,

I spoke to our in house counsel about the arbitration clause and they are
willing to leave it in.
So, to sum up here are our responses your original eMail:

1.  Canadian Securities Rep:  Please have your Canadian counsel review our
language which our outside Canadian counsel prepared.
2.  Ok.
3.  We're ok with this now.
4.  We're ok to leave this in.
5.  Ok.
6.  Please see my comments below.

Thanks,

My tax department is ok with the forms in Part 3 a i) and ii) of ths
schedule, but ask that 3 a)ii) be changed to "...before December 31st of
each third succeeding year..." (ie, the same as part 3a)i)).

Also they have asked that we obtain the proper mailing address and contact
name for these forms.

Plese let me know if there is a problem with this requested change.

Sandy:
Susan Bailey passed on to me your comments to the ISDA draft and I can
respond
to some but not all of such comments at this point:

1.   With respect to your Canadian securities rep, I am checking with our
counsel in Canada about whether we can use your language instaed of ours.

2.   With respect to the Options rep and the ESP rep in part %, Section
(b),
I
believe that both parties need to make such reps.  The rep in Part 5
(b)(g)(ii)
is to cover the Trade Option exemption and it is different from the ESP rep
below it.

3.   With respect to the language in Part 5, Section (a), this is different
from
the setoff language.    What this is saying is that if a party has
fulfilled
all
of its payment obligations and an Event of Default occurs with respect to
it
(the "Defaulting Party"), the other party cannot withhold any payment that
it
owes to the Defaulting Party.  This is different from the exercise of
setoff
rights.

4.   I would like to discuss with you or your legal representative the
removal
of the arbitration language as it is Enron's policy to have arbitration
apply.

5.   We would prefer to keep the Termination Currency specified in US
Dollars.

6.   Our tax group believes that we need the language in Part 3(a)(i),
(ii).
Why do you want to delete it?

I look forward to hearing from you.

1. Are you referring to the paragraph where I have a blank?  If so, this is 
part of Leslie Hansen's issue which she and Mark have discussed and I wasn't 
sure when I drafted this who our counterparty would be.

2. With respect to Paragraph 4, all we are doing is saying that their 
indemnity to us does not  cover losses that we incur as a result of our own 
acts.  This is a crave out that we have given in the past to those that I 
have requested it and it seems to us a fair compromise given the one-sided 
nature of the indemnity language.

Couple of questions:

- What is the intention of the first paragraph?
- So, does Paragraph 4 roughly translate to: "Counterparty is allowed to 
whack us if we don't have high enough security"?

Jay:
Jeff Hodge forwarded your voice mail to me.  I will give you a call later 
this morning to talk about the LC margin language that you need.  It might 
help me if you could describe how the margining will work.  Typically there 
is some dollar threshold against  which our Exposure is measured and anything 
over that threshold needs to be supported by collateral.  In addition, there 
is usually some Material Adverse Change trigger that reduces the threshold to 
zero.  Is that how yours will work?

Jim would like to talk to someone about problems he is having with his 
customers concerning the ISDA and CSA forms.  Apparently, most of his 
customers feel that it is too complicated and Jim would like to see if any 
alternatives exist.  Could someone please contact him?  Thanks.

I've been intending to send this e-mail to you for a few weeks but somehow 
got distracted.  I was wondering how things have been going with you over the 
past few months and was hoping that you could send me an e-mail with your 
impressions of the group and how it has been doing since my leave.  As for 
me, I'm doing great.  Charles is really growing fast and it has been a great 
experience for me staying home with him.  I'm really enjoying it, although I 
miss work too!   I'm sorry that I haven't brought him up for a visit but we 
have been so busy here that it's hard to plan a trip downtown, but someday 
I'll make it up there.  Hope everything is going well with you.  Look forward 
to hearing from you.

Carol

I left Oxy at the end of March, but have been asked to continue to do some 
work for them, including trying to put the ISDA "to bed".

If you are still at this address, I will try to get you a redraft based on 
your last comments in a few days, at which point we can discuss where we need 
to go from there.

I am a friend of Trina Chandler's and am currently looking for a full time 
nanny to take care of my 4 month old.  Trina mentioned to me that you had a 
temp a few months ago that was looking for a full time position.  Do you know 
if she is still available?  If so, please call me at home at 281-890-7122 or 
e-mail me.  If you know of anyone else that may be looking for a job, please 
keep me in mind.  How did you find your nanny?

Carol - While it never too late to suggest a change, given the political 
situation I would be hesitant to offer anything more than a "clarification".  
While I would not spend a huge amount of time on it, I suggest you examine if 
there are any changes. Depending on what happens in the Senate (now that it 
is in Democratic hands), the process can be reopened and we could have an 
opportunity to offer suggested changes (or it kill the bill all together).

Chris:
Would it be too late to suggest changes to the definition of "forward 
contracts" in the Bankruptcy Code in order to improve our position with 
respect to the physical supply contracts that EES enters into?  I am not sure 
what chnages we would want, but was wondering if there was any opportunity to 
suggest a change.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks.

Dave has reviewed my proposed languages and signed off on the changes.    So, 
if he needs to see the final letter, he should be okay with my changes.  Do 
you think I need to discuss with him the specific question I raised below re 
1 ETA Amendment vs. 3 separate letters? 

I'll let you know when I've finalized with John.

I've talked to John this morning and am working to finalize my agency 
language.  FYI, my preference is to set up GPU with 3 separate passwords -- 
GPU Service Inc. as agent for Met Ed, GPU Service Inc. as agent for Penn, and 
GPU Service Inc. as agent for NJ.  Pending resolution of Enpower bridging 
issues this afternoon, I intend to precede along this path since GPU is 
amenable.  Do you think we should have GPU execute 3 separate ETA Amendments 
in each capacity separately or do you think we should have them sign 3 
password applications and execute one ETA Amendment relating to all three 
capacities.

Jeff Sorenson forarded me your letter to him regarding the Annex A letter 
that you received.  The reason that you received this letter was because of 
trades that we do with Aquila Canada Corp.  You are correct that we are in 
the process of finanlizing a Master with UtiliCorp but only trades with ARMC 
will go under that Master.  We are alos in the process of sending out a draft 
of the Master that we intend to put in place with Aquila Canada Corp but 
until that is completed, all trades with ACC will be done using the Annex A 
terms and conditions.  Please call me if you have any questions at 
713-853-3989.

I spoke with Rod Nelson, our credit person, about the cross default language 
and we have the following proposal to make.  We are okay with the language as 
it applies to declaring a an Event of Default and then declaring an early 
Termination Date.  For purposes of triggering a reduction of the collateral 
threshold to zero, we would propose that this language would not apply such 
that an event of Default would be triggered upon the occurrence of the cross 
default.  Let me know what you think.

Tanya:
I just received a revised draft of the ISDA Schedule.  There is just 1 point 
that I want to raise with you.  You may recall that in Credit Event Upon 
Merger we created a special exception for them in connection with their 
upcoming reorg which stated that either the transferee or its Credit Support 
Provider would have to have a Credit Rating of BBB- or better OR Baa3 or 
better.  They now have added this same concept as a carve-out/exception to 
the "transfer" provisions in section 7, such that upon any transfer, the 
other party cannot withhold its consent to such transfer if the transferee 
provides a Guaranty from an entity that meets the above ratings test.  Are 
you okay with this as a general carve out for all types of transfers?  Our 
typical language is that we can withhold our consent unless the transferee 
provides a satisfactory guaranty to us.

Carol, attached is the agreement with the changes you requested and my
suggested wording to Section 4. I trust I picked up your changes correctly,
as they were not too clear on the fax.

Except for two small changes in 4,(adding the word "on" in line 12, and
changing "confirmed" to "executed" in the last line) I did not make the
changes you faxed on 2(g) or 4 as we require some language to carve out of
those limitaions the information we use for our offer. Please see what I
suggested instead of the wording sent last time.

Trust this will be acceptable and we can attach this to a letter agreement
stating this is the ETA. This will also have to be referenced in the
Password Agreement

Carol:

I think we will need your input regarding these subordination issues since 
they affect ENA's rights under the swap documents.  I believe Lou is going to 
try to schedule a meeting today to discuss.  It would be helpful if you could 
join us.  Might you be available?

I will send you a chart of the structure of the transaction.

Thanks.

Teresa

Thanks.  If there is some discreet way to check with Mark, Anne, Tana and 
Mary about this I would really appreciate it.  I'm guessing that the gift 
came from Anne.  Again, it was from Baby Gift on University Blvd. and it was 
2 one piece outfits - 1 with an Elephant/Turtle/Bear design and 1 with a 
Monkey design.  Thanks for your help.

Dear Carol -

Enclosed are drafts of (i) the ISDA schedule, (ii) Paragraph 13 to the
Credit Support Annex, and (iii) our standard guarantee.   Also included is a
draft what should be in the L/C and Schedule 1 of a Stby L/C.

Please note that I have accepted most of the previous changes so the current
issues would more easily be seen in the draft.

Comments concerning the schedule and para 13 are below:  Note - our legal
council is out this week but I thought I would send this draft to you now,
and we can make further adjustments, if any, based on our legal department
review next week.

1.  Part 1 (e):  After Charles Hofer spoke with your Credit Manager, Brant
Reves, they decided to make the cross default threshold at $100MM for each
credit support provider.
2.  1(h):  Made change per our phone conversation that Market Quotation will
apply for 3 years or less; Loss for over 3 years.
3.  5(g):  I am confused by this change.  I added back in the word
"obligations" in para B, 5th line and added back in the phrase concerning
affiliates.  I'm not sure my predecessor deleted them (it is not deleted on
my 3/20/00 draft) but I can't imagine who else would.  Two comments (i) do
you think this is best way to word this, and (2) my legal council (who is
out most of this week) will have to review your final wording before we can
execute.
4.  5(l):  Changed the telephone recording paragraph by (a) not limiting it
to just trading staff and (b) adding "to the extent permitted by applicable
law".
5.  5(n-q):  All new paragraphs that are not part of our standard agreement.
However, these were not discussed in Susan's last memo to you (except the
adding back in of paragraph q) so I am leaving them as is.
6.  Part 6:  After reviewing your changes vs. our standard paragraphs, I
have no objections to your changes
7.  13(b)(i)(C) Accepted your definition of Credit Support Amount even
though we don't normally use Independent Amounts.
8.  13(b)(iii)(A)  Letters of Credit - changes days to 20 from 10, per your
request.  After re-reading, I don't understand how it improves the position
of the secured party.  If the L/C has an expiration date and the secured
party attempts to execute (i.e.: cash in) this L/C, then if the L/C is
within 20 days of its expiration, the value can drop to zero.  Before, the
L/C maintained 100% of its value until 10 days prior to expiration.  Since
Enron looks at these contracts from the secured party perspective, how does
your position improve based on this change?
8.  13(b)(iii)(B and C) Threshold for both of us has been increased to $50MM
and Minimum Transfer Amount has been reduced to zero ($0).

For questions, please call at 713-420-3548 or email me.

Thanks!

John

Jim:
At long last, enclosed is a draft of the ETA Amendment Letter that addresses 
the termination issue.  Since the last draft, we have had new procedures in 
place that require all amendments to be approved by the head of our Online 
group.  This review process resulted in several chnages to the draft that I 
previously sent you, namely:

1. We cannot agree in Section 3(e) to change the word "may" to "shall", due 
in part to the fact that we are looking into doing paperless trades online.

2. In the amendment to section 4(b), he has asked that we delete any 
reference to omissions.

I apologize for this.  Please call me after you have had a chance to review 
this.

I am working on the ETA amendment letter which I hope to send to you 
shortly.  We have a new procedure here where every amendment needs to be 
signed off by the head of the Online group so I need to get their blessing 
before I send it on to you.  Since most if not all of our issues were more 
legal in nature I don't foresee a problem with this.

ATTORNEY CLIENT  PRIVILEGED.



The assignment looks fine, but I don't understand the underlying 
transaction.  Is EEL transferring this domain name "WEATHER-DESK.COM" without 
any consideration other than using RMS' software program for six months?

Before executing this agreement, you need to secure Mark Palmer's permission 
since the agreement states that no variation of the name may be used.  He is 
the vice president of advertising at Enron Corp.  I have copied him on this.

Mark

Not sure of your exact email address but hopefully one of these is correct.
Can you please confirm that you receive this?

Below is the agreement our attorneys have drafted for the transfer of the
www.weather-desk.com domain name.  Note that they have recommended that a
few of the more specific details regarding the corresponding Enron usage of
the RMS weather model be addressed in a simple but separate license
agreement.   As discussed, in addition to general confidentialiy
provisions, those terms will include (1) the access will not cover any
international weather data that may be added to the system during the term
of use through December 31, as our costs associated with such data are
uncertain and (2) the use of the model will be for Enron internal purposes
only with no data or analysis results to be shared with third parties.

I would appreciate if you can forward this to your legal dept. to review so
that we can hopefully get this resolved quickly.

Thanks/regards

Paul

I will take a look at the Guaranty and get back to you but my recollection 
was that the termination provisions did not make clear that the Guaranty

termination date with respect to transactions that were entered into prior to 
the termination date and taht was the concept that needs to be addressed.

Susan,
Carol,

I reviewed this response from the credit person at WPS, I have looked at the 
Guaranty we receive from them with respect to the paragraph he refers to, I 
do not know if the particular sufficient satisfies your request or if your 
requested language stills needs to be inserted.

Please advise,
Russell

Russell,

There is already language in the Guaranty that acknowledges and guarantees
payment of WPS ESI obligations and liabilities under terms of the
"Agreements".  You request only restates what has already been defined and
agreed to.  I don't understand why it needs to be stated again.

Feel free to send me any thoughts you may have on these issues.  We really

Rhett:
We are in the process of negotiating an ISDA with this counterparty which is 
a German Bank and is not a Multibranch Party.  We just received their 
comments to our ISDA Schedule and they raised the following tax issues:

1. They have deleted the Section 3(f) rep in our Schedule and inserted 
"none". 

2. In our tax forms section, they have deleted our language and added 
language that only requires them to give to us a Form 4224 in connection with 
payments received by them under the ISDA that are attributable to the conduct 
of a business in the US.

3. They have modified the definition of "Indemnifiable Tax" to include taxes 
imposed as a result of a Change in Tax Law by an authority in the 
jurisdiction of the payee, unless the payor is located in such jurisdiction .

I will send you their mark-up but I need your advice on how to handle these 
comments.  Thanks.

you on all of the points that they need to address.  On the Event of Default 
issue, do you think that Janet Greene's proposed language to the "null and 
void" sentence as well as the drawing certificate works?  I was concerned 
that the language "Event of Default under the Confirm" may lead to some 
confusion as to what Events of default are covered.  What do you think?

I believe the gift is either from Anne or Tana.  I over heard Mary H. say she 
had to take her daughter to the doctor this morning and during the morning 
confusion did not get out the house with her baby gift for you.  Mark Taylor 
made a contribution through Sara, that I was not aware of.  He should have

Carol - While it never too late to suggest a change, given the political 
situation I would be hesitant to offer anything more than a "clarification".  
While I would not spend a huge amount of time on it, I suggest you examine if 
there are any changes. Depending on what happens in the Senate (now that it 
is in Democratic hands), the process can be reopened and we could have an 
opportunity to offer suggested changes (or it kill the bill all together).

It has come to my attention that we made need another agreement similar to 
the one that we did with the ANNEX A form to cover the GTC's that Puget is 
bound by when it trades online with us.  I have enclosed the online GTC.  It 
is very similar to Annex A but I think that we need to deal with it 
separately.  Let me know what you think.

Dear Carol,    We do not want to create an agreement specfic coversheet for
each counterparty.  Is there some way to put language in the body of the
letter agreement to address your concerns.  The procedure we are proposing
is intended to supplement current requirements in the ISDA, not replace
them.  If you feel that additional definition needs to be added to the
confirmation process, shouldn't we put that definition in the letter
agreement rather than on the cover sheet?

Our goal is to be able to expedite our response to counterparty confirms.
In order to do this we need to have the same cover sheet in place for each
counterparty.  Please call me at 678-579-3378 so that we may discuss
possible solutions.  Thanks, Lin

Subject: Response to Comments

Karen:
Here is our response to your e-mail comments:

1. We can put back VI(c)(i) but the reason that we deleted it was because the 
provisions in VI(c)(ii) and VI(E) really deal with how an LC can be drawn 
upon and the language in VI(c)(i) seemed unnecessary and perhaps inconsistent 
with those sections.  If we put it back in, it should be made subject to 
those other sections.

2. With respect to your points regarding the amount that can be drawn, I am 
unclear as to what your position is.  In one place you want to limit it to 
amounts owed and in another you want to limit it to Exposure Amount.  What is 
your position.  We thought that the formula that we set forth in Section 4(b) 
of the amendment was what everyone had agreed to.

3. The reason for the change in E.4.(c) is because the Event of Default 
situation has already been addressed in VI(c)(ii).

4. I need to check with our credit people regarding the transferability 
issue.  I will note that the current form that is attached to the Master 
permits transfers.  Why is this an issue with you?

I look forward to hearing from you.  My number is 713-853-3989.

Thanks for the info.  Our family doctor has recommended someone close by so 
we'll give him a try.  Hang in there on the moving details.  I know that 
things will settle down soon.  Things are great here.  Charles Eugene seems 
to be adjusting well and we are really enjoying him.  He'll be in his crib in 
a few weeks.  As for the swap group, yes they are thin but they appear to be 
hanging in there.  I spoke with Mark yesterday.  When I left, Sara was in 
London taking care of her mom who became very ill while ahe was over there.  
She is fine now and Sara is back but Mark pretty much had to handle things on 
his own for a few days.  He appears to have survived.  we just hired Susan 
Flynn's replacement so hopefully by the end of August the LA's will be back 
at full strength which will help out alot.  Take care and keep in touch.  You 
may be getting some e-mails from Mary Cook about some of my files which she 
has now inherited.

We used a pediatrician in Tomball, Dr. Carr.  Dawn liked him quite well (and 
I did too), but it's a bit of a drive.  I could ask my wife for other names?

I'm pulling my hair out with moving details - bank accounts, leases, 
shipments, tax forms ...  Sara tells me legal is pretty thin these days.  
Credit is the same in Houston.  Tracey is moving to Portland, Christopher 
left and John is moving to the Market Risk Group.  I got out just in time.

I made a mistake on the language that we sent you on MAC.  On the last part 
where it talks about a failure to be rated, my understanding from our 
discussions is that a MAC would only be triggered if a party's credit support 
provider failed to be rated by either S&P or Moody's  so that if it lost one 
rating but maintained the other rating a MAC would not be triggered.  For 
this reason the amendment should read ...or its Credit Support Provider shall 
fail to have a rating from either S&P or Moody's. 

Please confirm that this is your understanding and sorry for the confusion.

 We have developed a form of multi-product counterparty Guaranty that is a

As currently written with my changes, we will return any written confidential 
information.  In addition, to the extent that we prepare internal analyses, 
memos etc.  that contain confidential information, we usually do not want to 
give our work product to the other party.  Therefore, we agree to keep it 
subject to the terms of the CA or destroy it and that is what my Insert A 
says and that is why I deleted their language.

With respect to the term Representative, that should be defined to mean any 
director, officer, employee, counsel, representative and affiliate of any 
party as well as any affiliate's directors, officers, employees, counsel or 
representative.

Have you reviewed the description of Confidential Information, and in 
particular, clause (d) and are you comfortable with it.  Other than the 
reference to the Website, is there anything else that we should add as a 
description of what we are showing them?

Finally,  per Louise's e-mail, she doesn't want to agree to the no 
solicitation language until we contract with them.  Could you please 
communicate that to them?

This coming Friday Sara and I are going to walk the legal assistants through 
some basic concepts with respect to the ISDA and CSA Schedules and 
confirmations.  Do you think that we should invite some of the newer credit 
people to this and if so, who?  Some of this will be a repeat of what we did 
a few weeks ago but at a more basic level.  We were thinking that it may be 
beneficial for Nidia Mendoza and Cathy Tudon.  Let me know what you think.

If you look at the stc(sent to c-party)-dcaf tab, you will notice that the 
numbers are decreasing due to amendments
being signed by counterparties for negative confirmations.

Once we move forward with the new financial spreadsheet, I'm confident that 
we will see the financial
numbers decrease as well.

I'd like to meet once before you leave if possible to wrap-up our discussions 
on a few critical counterparties
which were close to an agreement with us including Morgan Stanley (who were 
not signing confirms and were
sending back there own form of confirmation which wasn't allowed)

Thank you,

Hi,
Jeff asked me to forward the new report to you.

Here is the format of the new report and a brief description of each tab:

1. formerage-Willie's prior aging schedule. Do we want to see this for each 
c/p? I think it would be helpful
2. aging-Current aging schedule by year
3. STC-Dcaf-Current physical STC information from Dcaf
4. STC-Tagg-Current physical STC information from tagg
5. financial-Current and new format. If you move the lower bar to the right 
of the gray boxes, you will see the new columns
     which we've discussed.

I completed the master agreement column from the Lotus Notes database;

We are currently waiting on credit for the exposure information and their 
assessment (e.g. 'credit concern', 'good credit', etc.);

Tagg is able to provide term information for each counterparty, but since it 
is a time-intensive process, Ron Nolte is looking
into adding a button in tagg that will allow this and/or create a special 
customized ongoing report;

I am in the process of completing the remaining two columns (i.e. do they 
sign confirms?, if they don't, reasons why?)

Overall, I think that this new format, including my proposed aging schedule, 
will be a valuable 'tool' for all involved in our
follow-up work. 

Thanks
David

Please keep in mind that we are not basing our decision on which 
counterparties to contact solely based on exposure and credit concern 
information, but rather based on all of the categories that Mark Taylor and I 
have asked you to compile with respect to each counterparty so I don't want 
the exposure numbers to be limited to any particular type of counterparty.

Hi,
I don't know how this was settled between Carol and Russell, and  I don't 
understand why Russell would not
want to provide this exposure information to us.

As we discussed earlier last month, I think it would be good to select a 
date, let's say July 5th in this case, and then go forward.

I like your idea of identifying whether the c/p is a 'credit concern' or a 
'good credit', perhaps this could be listed in the 'status' column
on the following spreadsheet.

I have attached a list of updated counterparty names.


Thanks
David

Subject: Re: Project  

How did things get settled between Carol and Russell?   Looking over the 
spreadsheet itself, I would be able to tell you right off which 
counterparties we consider "Credit Concerns", where you would then prioritize 
on your end.  Even though some counterparties may high high exposures, we 
consider them to be "Good Credits" (for example Duke).  Once again, financial 
exposures vary (sometimes very significantly) from one day to the next.  
Therefore the totals you'll have for current exposures will not be validated 
for more than a week, at the max.

Let me know how you want to go about this.  I think if I highlight which 
counterparties we feel you should look into, this would go a lot faster.

Regards--VE

Here is where I understand Bill came out on the 6.1(a) issue that we were 
discussing.  ACE agreed to insert language that would carve out "publicly 
available" information, but with respect to all other information that would 
be covered by 6.1(a) and the Right of Recovery section, they would not agree 
to limit the Enron group.

Subject: Dresdner Bank Credit Issues

Rod:
The following are the credit issues that they raised in their comments:

1. Cross default threshold - instead of $100,000,000 they want a 3% of equity 
test.

2. Credit Event Upon Merger - they want to delete the amendment language in 
our Schedule

3. MAC Trigger - this currently is an Event of Default.  They want to make it 
a Termination Event.  Also, they want to add to the trigger going below a 
Baa3 rating by Moody's.

4.  In the financial reporting section, they want to add on our side a 
requirement that we deliver to them any financial or business report that we 
make available to our shareholders or that we file with the SEC or bank 
regulatory authorities

5. In the Netting language, they have excluded FX and Currency Option 
transactions.

6. In the setoff language, they have limited the trigger to the designation 
of an Early Termination date because of the Termination Event Credit Event 
Upon Merger.  Alos, they want setoff to apply to "matured and unmatured" 
obligations.

7. They don't want a cap on the Enron Guaranty

8. In the Termination section where we specify Loss and Second method that 
have an interesting rider (insert 2) that modifies how the Second Method 
works.  I'm still trying to understand what this language does but it appears 
to qualify any payments on termination that the Non-Defaulting Party would 
have to make to the Defaulting Party.

I will send you a copy of their comments and hopefully we will talk to them 
about this next week.

John:
I was reviewing an amendment that Susan bailey was working on concerning the 
ISDA Master between ECC and Petro Canada and wanted to make sure that you 
were comfortable leaving as is the following provisions that are in the 
Schedules:

1. They have amended the definition of Specified Indebtedness.  I'm not sure 
I understand  why if we have a threshold amount they need the first part of 
the language and wanted your thoughts on this.  Alos, does the second part of 
the language need to be updated or revised in any manner?

2. They have deleted the concept of Credit event Upon Merger.

3. They have added to Specified Transaction a Physical Master Agreement which 
makes this part of the cross default to specified transaction Event of 
Default trigger.  Should we specify a threshold?

4. They have added an additional termination event that contains some unusual 
ratings triggers.  For example, are we rated by the 2 bond rating services 
that they describe, and if not, doesn't that trigger clause (2) of this 
additional Termination Event?   I don;'t think the cure language works and I 
don't understand how it works with the collateral threshold since the trigger 
for that to go to zero is something else.

5. I'll just note that setoff rights do not currently apply if there is a 
Termination Event that is caused by Tax Event or Tax Event Upon Merger.

6. In the CSA, we have permitted cash and government securities which I think 
is problematic given our general rule in Canada that we only take LC's.

7. There is a Minimum Transfer Amount of $500,000.

Please call me when convenient to discuss further.

Carol

Sorry I haven't got back to you sooner.  Can you give me your home number?  I 
think that weekends would be easier to schedule since weekdays are still 
fairly hectic.  I'll call you soon.  How about this heat?  Fortunately, I've 
been playing early in the mornings or late at night so it's not too bad.  
I've also am hooked on watching the Open every day - a fringe benefit to 
maternity leave.  Tonight should be great.  I hope one of the Williams' gets 
beat.  talk to you soon.

Hi Carol!

Thrilled to hear all is going well.  I would love to play tennis anytime 
(hopefully sooner rather than later so I can take advantage of  that 
lingering fatigue that takes months? years? to abate).  We can play at the 
Met either around lunchtime or sometime after 4:00.  Weekends would also 
work.  Can you play next Tuesday or Wednesday?  Call or write.

See you soon

Susan:
I spoke with Utilicorp's contract person today and we have decided to do the 
following:

1. Leave the ISDA dated May 3, 2000
2. Change the Assignment Effective Date in the Transfer Agreement to whatever 
date we agree upon with Utilicorp.

Apparently, the ISDA has not been signed yet but will be by them in the next 
few days.  Until Russell comes back, they cannot sign the Transfer 
Agreement.  Could you please do the following this week:

1. Have the enclosed new form of Transfer Agreement signed and sent to 
Russell.  Leave the date on Page 1 blank.
2. Send to Russell the additional certificate that he is requesting attaching 
ENA's resolutions.
Thanks.



Brant:
How much lead time to we need to make the switch online?  Does Utilicorp have 
a password?  I'm hopeful that by sometime next week, they will sign the 
Transfer Agreement so that all trades could be confirmed under Utilicorp.

Karen:
Please take a look at what we have agreed to in Section 4(b) of the 
amendment.  Your new language does not track that language and if you are 
going to add language to the LC it needs to track that language.  I 
personally feel that this language is unnecessary so long as the drawing 
condition is specified.

Carol:

The additional transfer language is sufficient.

I black lined an insert to address TEFP's concern that the letter of credit 
may be exercised on
default, only when funds are owed.

Please advise if this change is acceptable to Enron.  (If it is, I will print 
copies of the
attached, & replace the existing letter of credit format with the attached 
document, so that
Susan does not have to generate executions copies again.)


Thank you,



Karen

The above is a Canadian counterparty that we are negotiating an ISDA with.  
They had some problems with the tax language that we had in our ISDA schedule 
(which I have enclosed).  Can I give them your name and number as a contact?  
Their tax person's name is Sheri Dunn.

Could you please confirm the following for me:

1. With ACE USA, Inc., we confirm using the "deemed ISDA" format.  For some 
reason they were on our Annex A list.  Do you know why?

2. We only do physical deals with Northern Indiana Public Service Company and 
the "Columbia Gas" entities.  Again, they too were on our Annex A list.

Thanks.

Thanks.  I expect to get a new draft of the Schedules from DB later today.  
As for the crib, it is perfect and Bill and a friend managed to put it 
together.  Thanks so much for lending it to us.  I'm hoping that we will have 
a child to put in it within the next week.  As for Mexico, the issue there is 
that they do not recognize setoff in bankruptcy so that if deals are done 
with 2 different Enron counterparties we will not be able to setoff.

I don't know if you are still handling this.  We are close to getting this 
finalized.  One credit comment from them that I need someone's thoughts on.  
They want the Issuer of LC's to maintain a credit rating of A from S&P and A2 
from Moody's.  We usually put A- and A3.  are you okay with this?  If I need 
to run this by someone else please let me know.

Ed-

Please see attached changes to the LOC Formats proposed by Enron.  I have
revised the draw language and expiration date language to reflect the
changes we agreed to last week.

In addition, I have inserted a paragraph at the end of the LOC form to
reflect a change requested by the bank.  It relates to the ability to
transfer the LOC.  Also attached is the form of transfer statement that the
bank will require if Enron chooses to transfer the LOC to another party.
It looks relatively straight forward and I believe it should be acceptable
to you.

Please review these changes and if acceptable, we can proceed with
execution of the documents.

(See attached file: Enron EEI LOC Format REVISED 052901.doc)
(See attached file: Enron ISDA LOC Format REVISED 052901.doc)

Thanks and regards-

Kaiser is hopeful that an answer on this can come quickly as they would like 
to enter into the physical index deal as soon as tomorrow or Friday.

Subject: Kaiser US/UK Setoff w/MG and ENA

Carol,

West power is looking to do a financial swap with Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical 
Corporation ("Kaiser Aluminum") whereby Kaiser Aluminium would buy the swap 
and pay ENA float.  Kaiser Aluminum International Inc. ("Kaiser 
International") has a big market presence in the UK and MG has significant 
forward financial and physical metals positions with Kaiser International 
which I believe are quite out-of-the-money.

Can we find out whether or not we can perform a bilateral, affiliate NETTING 
AGREEMENT between Kaiser International and Kaiser Aluminum with MG and EPMI?  
If the UK is going to continue to do short-term new metals business with 
Kaiser International and if we can get comfortable with metals forward 
positions that are OTM, we would like to use this position and leverage off 
of it for trading liquidity in the states.  Secondly, does the netting need 
to just pertain to global financial business or can it include physical as 
well?

If possible, I'd like to see if you and a UK trading attorney can speak about 
the overall concept and briefly address any UK and domestic law conflicts.  
Please call when you have a opportunity to discuss.  ENA is looking to enter 
into a power swap for June '01.  I'm not sure if this concept is achievable, 
and if it is, in the time frame we're facing.  However, if we can't do a June 
swap, then we'll try for a July swap.

Regards,
Tracy

		 Subject: Re: Mid Market Power Form/ENA Changes

Marianne:
The following are my comments:

1. In Section 1.1, there should be a parentheses after etc. in the 5th line.

2. In Section 3.1, in the last sentence after the proviso insert "a" before 
the word "change" and after the word "in".

3. In Section 6.1, change 20 Business Days to 20 days.  Also, add a semicolon 
at the end of clause (i).

4. In Section 6.2.1 I'll just note that the discount rate sentence I think is 
still an open issue.

5. In Section 6.3, clause (c) should be reworded to fit with the language in 
the beginning of the Section.

6. Capitalize the word "facility" in the definition of Average Annual Load 
Factor.

7. Delete the definition of Costs as it is already defined in Section 6.2.1.

8. Where is the defined term Govt Authority used?

9. In the GTC, the ECP rep should also apply to EESI.  Also, in the 7th line 
of the reps add the word "into" after the word "entered" and before the word 
"this".

10. In Collateral Requests, insert a comma after deposit in the last line.  I 
will also add granting/perfection language.

11. In Events of Default, clause (a) refers to a dispute section which I'm 
not sure exists.  In clause (e), delete the "s": from the word consolidation.

12. Remedies should be deleted as it is already covered in Section 6.1.

13. In UCC/Disclaimer of warranties, add a clause (c).

I would add setoff language.

		 Subject: Mid Market Power Form/ENA Changes

Carol:

I have attempted to incorporate the changes that Jim has incorporated in our 
long form power agreement which ENA has suggested to date into the short 
form.  Attached please find a sample short form (for the Con Ed market) for 
your review.  

Please note the following as you review:

1.  The short forms do not contain the optionality relating to our performing 
billing services -- all of our midmarket  forms anticipate that we will act 
as customer's billing agent and that we will collect all amounts due related 
to T&D and the like from the customer (and reflect same on our invoice) and 
pass those amounts on to the customer's utility.
2.  I did not include a "Setoff" provision in this draft, mainly because the 
vast majority of the time, we will not, nor will an affiliate, have another 
agreement in place with these customers.  If you feel strongly about our 
including a setoff provision, we will do so.
3.  The change in law provision reads a bit differently from the long form -- 
the thinking here is that the long form language is very lengthy and rather 
harsh (and we've had great difficulty selling it in the past).  Taking into 
consideration this class of customer, we decided to include certain items, 
including our inability to cover our costs due to a change in law, rules or 
practices as a "force majeure event" in an effort to soften the approach (see 
the GTCs).  Also we do not address calculation of a termination payment in 
the event of a change in law as the long form does -- again, more in the 
interest of "saving space" than anything else...

Let us know your thoughts on this document and if you are comfortable with 
our using this until such time as the hybrid form is launched.  If you are 
comfortable, we will drive these changes into our other midmarket power forms.

Thanks again for your help with this project,

Marianne

P.S.  Please be sure to copy Sarah Dietrich and Jennifer Hillegonds on your 
response -- they will be taking this project during my "hiatus"  --  I am 
moving to PA on Friday of this week, and will be out of pocket through 
approximately 7/16.  I will start up again in mid-July...

Tana:
As we discussed, here is my list of amendments that are according to my 
records in various stages of negotiation:

1. Allegheny energy - Patricia Clark sent to Frank Davis her comments on June 
15th by e-mail.  I responded on June 19th and have never heard back from 
her.  Most of her comments we could not accept.  None of her comments have 
been run by Dave.

2. Imperial Oil -  Grant Oh was handling this.  They had 3 comments. most of 
which we could not accept.  I spoke with Grant about this around June 6th and 
have never heard back from him.  None of their proposed changes have been run 
by Dave.

3. Kennecott Coal Sales Company - A draft amendment letter which Dave F. has 
approved was sent to them on May 15th.  My contact there is Jim Sobule  Wayne 
Gresham is alos involved in this.  I have never heard back from Jim. 

4. Arco - We received by e-mail comments from David Dyck at Arco in March.  
Tori Kuykendall and Grant Oh are involved from the Enron side.  I responded  
to David Dyck by e-mail on March 10th and have never heard anything further 
on this.  None of their comments or my response has been reviewed by Dave.

5. Chevron - Canada - I received a letter from Bruce Borwick  on January 31st 
which I responded to and have never heard anything further from them.  Dave 
has not reviewed their comments or my response.

6. Cargill - I sent to Mike Pederson a form of amendment letter which I don't 
think has been signed.  They wanted a minor change to the confidentiality 
language.  Dave has not seen this but in the event that Cargill comes back to 
life, i doubt that he will have a problem with it.

7. Cinergy - I sent a draft amendment letter which dave approved to John 
Dirheimer on May 15th.   To my knowledge it has not been signed.

8. Duke Energy - I sent a draft amendment letter to John Puett on May 15th 
which Dave approved.  To my knowledge, it has not been signed.

9. Talisman - we have been exchanging drafts of a revised ETA for months.  My 
contact there is Ann Love.  We are close to reaching agreement with them and 
mark has been involved in some of the early discussions.  I am sending to 
Dave a mark-up of the revised agreement for his approval.


All of the ETA amendment letters and the Talisman revised ETA are in my 
directory under specproj/online.

My understanding is that our attorney, Mike Kessler, has faxed the motion
back to Enron and is waiting for a go ahead before we have it filed.  Should

Mary,

Per my voice mail to you, I am updating you on the status of the ISDA's we 
have sent to Engage:

1) Engage Energy US, LP:
I spoke to Luke Mickum, the legal person at Engage US (713-877-7446), this 
morning.  He is looking into what issues need to be reviewed/discussed.  
According to Carol there are no open issues.  If that is the case can we send 
executed copy's of the ISDA to him for signature.  Before it is sent off, we 
need to make sure the correct changes have been made to the Credit Annex, as 
the credit support provider has changed from my original credit worksheet.  I 
am not sure if Carol had made those changes in her drafts.

2) Engage Energy Canada, LP
According to the Lotus Notes Database, the draft amendment of this contract 
was also sent to Luke, although he is the US lawyer.  A draft needs to be 
sent to the Canadian Lawyer, Suzzi Sethi 403-297-0348.  She sent us a draft 
guaranty for review with the guarantor West Coast Gas Inc.  This counterparty 
is the new guarantor for Engage Canada and the ISDA Credt Annex needs to be 
updated accordingly.  Once again, we need to make sure the Credit information 
is still correct in the original draft.  I have given a copy of the guaranty 
to Tana, can you please review this and provide your comments to Suzzi.

Please let me know if you require any additional information.

Thank you,

Russell

I am working with Tana on the Engage US amendment.  There should be no open 
issues, but before I left I sent some e-mails to Luke Mickum, their attorney 
which he never responded to.

Tana,
Please ask Mary Cook to review the Engage Canada Guaranty from West Coast.  
The comments that I made to the other Engage Guaranty which I have forwarded 
to you should apply here.  Has their attorney in Canada responded to  the 
Engage Canada amendment?  The latest draft of the Engage US amendment and the 
latest draft of the Engage Canada amendment I believe is still on your system 
and should be in the file, but you and Mary should both follow up with their 
attorney based on the e-mails that I sent to him which I have forwarded to 
you.

Hi Carol, 

Hope you and you newborn are doing well?  I am not sure what work issues you 
are handling, if any, but I would like to ask you if you have any further 
information on Engage.  I think Tana Jones may have been speaking to you on 
this issue.  I have received a guaranty format from Westcoast Gas Inc. to 
cover Engage Energy Canada LP.  They are waiting on our review before they 
issue the executed document.  Tana has a copy of this.  Also, I would like to

amendments so I can go ahead and work to finish them up.

Hope all is well,

Rob:
I'll do my best to get back to you tomorrow although I still have not heard 
from my credit person.  Other than the credit issue, I do want to talk to you 
about the following:

1. Deletion of the Termination Event in Section (j)(c).  If we have to choose 
between this and the covenant that you inserted in Part 5, I would much 
rather have this but I don't understand why we can't have both.

2. In the new language that you added in the "Recording" section, I don't 
think that I can agree to the reasonable expectation language unless we make 
it clear here that it would be reasonable to expect that any call that is 
made to or from our trading floor will be recorded.  Also, at the very 
beginning where it says "that originates from and" the word "and" needs to be 
"or" to cover the situation in our case where someone from your side that is 
not on the trading floor calls our trading floor.

3. In Part 5, Section (o) the last sentence, please change the word "herein" 
to "this Agreement" and please change the last reference to "the Existing 
Transactions" to "this Agreement" as I thought that this is what we agreed to.

4. In the definition of MAC, in clauses (a)(ii) and (b)(ii), please change 
the word "either" to "both" and the word "or" to "and", as I thought this is 
what we agreed to.

5. In the form of LC, our credit group has asked us to add language that 
amends Section 13(b) of the UCP to shorten the time frame from 7 to 3 days 
and I will fax that to you.

I will be tied up until late morning but otherwise available.

In my opinion, the wording suggested by Janet Green should be acceptable.
We
will have to have this wording formally approved by the surety companies
prior
to issuance.  I would like to avoid approaching the sureties until all
questions
have been addressed and all changes have been made.  In regards the bonds
being
subject to Texas law, I do not see that as being a problem.  We will
address
that with the sureties along with other potential changes.

In response to previous email, neither Dan nor I know of an attorney that
would
be willing or able to write an opinion in regards the applicability of the
Appleton Law.  As discussed during the meeting, this law has nothing to do
with
the viability of an exisitng surety bond.  If a surety issued a bond that
was
later found to be in violation of Appleton, they would be fined by the
State of
New York.  It does not make the bond invalid.  MJH

What if we said:  "if the
Principal shall promptly and faithfully perform its obligations under the
Confirm, which is a part of and governed by the Master Agreement, then this
obligation shall be null and void"

With respect to her second point, what if we again said "an Event of
Default has occurred under the Confirm, which is a part of and governed by
the Master Agreement"?

I think she is trying to clarify in the language that the bond can be
called for an Event of Default under the Master Agreement, which could have
nothing to do with the Confirm - - - which is factually correct.

Thankyou for the attached.  I believe the governing law for each issuing
surety will be the law where the surety is domiciled, but let me do some
checking and confirm this.  Also, will get back to you on your comments Re
the language in our recommended bond form...probably Monday or Tuesday next
week.  Thanks for your continued efforts in this matter.

Bill:
I spoke with our outside counsel yesterday and we have some more follow up
work that we need to do on our side.  One issue that may be of some
importance to us in our analysis is determining what the governing law of
the surety bond will be for each issuer, and more importantly, whether we
can have the bonds governed by Texas law.  Can you answer this for me?

Also, with respect to the form of the bond itself, as we mentioned at the
meeting, the language in the third paragraph which states that "if the
Principal shall promptly and faithfully provide the Firm energy as defined
in the Confirm, hen this obligation shall be null and void," does not work
for us.  Has anyone come up with alternative language?  Finally, with
respect to the Notice of Claim, we would like for the certification to say
something like, "an Event of Default has occurred under the Master
Agreement" rather than tie it to a specific default under the Confirmation.
Does that work for the sureties?

I look forward to hearing from you.

Here is my first cut at a proposed form of amendment.  I have added a rep and 
an additional Event of Default to cover the 'Lien" issue in light of the fact 
that Barrett's Credit Agreement restricts them from entering into any

FYI.  Can you and the clerks handle packing up my office?  I may be able to 
help but I don't want to make any commitment  that I can make it up there.  
Hopefully, it won't take that long and the only files that need to be marked 
or perhaps put in the legal assistant area are the files near my window.  If 
the move-out timing slips and happens while you are on vacation, I would 
prefer that it be handled before hand so that the floater doesn't have to 
worry about it.  Let me know what you think.  Sorry to impose but I tried to 
do as much as I could before I left.

It looks like Phase II of our construction project (over where Julia's office 
used to be) will be finished on the 18th so she will be moving into her new 
office that weekend.  I now have the plans for Phase III and it turns out 
your office will be included in the construction area.  Phase III will 
probably start on the 25th.  That could always slip but I wanted to give you 
as much notice as possible.

Hope you are all doing well.  Getting any sleep yet?

I think that we need to continue to pursue Williams and Richardson on getting 
either the confirms signed or getting a letter similar to the Morgan letter 
that they accept the terms of the confirms.

Thanks so much for your support.  I will have Bill drop your campaign stuff 
off at your house.  We are having a boyn and I have less than 3 months to 
go!  So far so good, although as of today, no more running and no more trips 
out of town.  Hope you are doing well.  Did you ever sell your baby stuff?  
If not, we may still be interested.

I need your help in answering the following questions:

EL PASO

Is the collateral threshold for both of us $50,000,000?
What are the Guaranty caps?
Is the cross default threshold now for both of us $100,000,000?
Should cross default only apply to the Credit Support Providers or should it 
apply to the parties and their credit support providers?

OCCIDENTAL

Should we insist on our "affiliate" setoff language?

I asked Tana to talk to you about the Susan Bailey situation so you are aware 
of exactly what happened today.  Both Sara and I think that it would be very 
helpful if you could communicate to the legal assistants what we talked about 
and that is that vacation day requests, doctors appts etc should be 
communicated in advance to the whole group and they should make sure that at 
the very least that the calendar reflects all vacation days.  However you 
decide to do that is fine with us.
Thanks.

The Schedules look fine.  Just one minor chnage which I can maker.  In the 
form of LC, I'm deleting the words "Rider 1" at the bottm and in the last 
paragrpah of page 1, chnagung the word "receipts" to "receipt".  We will 
generate and send to you execution sets.  With respect to the Guaranty, we 
would prefer that you sue the fopm which I sent to you a few weeks ago.  Here 
it is.  This form is our updated form and matches up with the Enron Guaarnty 
that we are giving you.

Carol -

Enclosed are what I hope will be the final drafts of the Schedule, Paragraph
13, LC provisions, and Schedule 1.

I have accepted and incorporated the new changes you made plus all the
changes which we have agreed upon.  I also changed the presentation of our
address in Part 4a of the schedule - it's the same information presented in
a more concise way.  Finally, I changed the signature block on the schedule
to eliminate EPME-Gas Company (it no longer exists) as a 'general partner" -
I don't know where that came from.

Also enclosed is our version of the Guarantee.  Please let me know if any
other changes are required.  If not, let's proceed with execution copies -
let me know if you want to generate them, or if you want me to.

John

The only comment that I have to the swap schedules is that I think we need to 
have an exception built into the arbitration language that permits us to go 
to court to enforce the remedies that we describe in the confidentiality 
section.  This probably hold true for all of the docs where we have 
arbitration and a ca provision.  Alos, there may be some defined terms that 
are now used in the new confidentiality language that haven't been defined 
(i.e, Enron, Enron Put Agreement etc)  Finally, should we upper case 
"affiliates" in the confidentiality   language and either use the ISDA def or 
some other def?

Subject: Degree day Information Request

Carol,

Some of the data sets we receive on a regular basis from the National Weather 
Service are not 100% complete.  i.e., a day or two of data may be missing 
from the data set.  In some cases, an entire month of data (temperatures, 
rainfall, and/or snowfall) may be missing.  For our internal purposes, our 
research group uses analytical tools to determine a "best guess" at what the 
actual data was.  We replace the blanks in our files with our best guesses.  
We usually highlight derived data in our files, but we cannot be sure that we 
have highlighted derived data in every case.

A customer is requesting some historical data from us.  We would like to send 
this data to them, but I am concerned about the legal liability of 
misrepresenting our analysis as fact.  What do we need to do to absolve 
ourselves of any liability in this regard?

Please call with any questions.

Regards,

Gary Taylor

Would you like me to give him the information??? 
 I've given him Raleigh and St. Louis  in the past because we had deals with 
Inergy in those cities. 
 We currently have NO active deals with Inergy.

Lucy,

I work with Bill Gautreaux at Inergy Services.  I am working on several
proposals in which historical degree day averages are needed.  Would you
be able to provide the 10 yr, 15 yr, 20 yr and 30 degree day averages
(ending with calendar 1999) for the following locations.

Raliegh, NC
Chattanooga, TN
Fort Wayne, IN
Chicago, IL
Detroit, MI

You have recently provided us with some of the information above, but I
am missing several components.

I can be reached at 816-741-5080 if you have any questions.

I appreciate your help in providing the information.

Carl Hughes

Mark

Not sure of your exact email address but hopefully one of these is correct.
Can you please confirm that you receive this?

Below is the agreement our attorneys have drafted for the transfer of the
www.weather-desk.com domain name.  Note that they have recommended that a
few of the more specific details regarding the corresponding Enron usage of
the RMS weather model be addressed in a simple but separate license
agreement.   As discussed, in addition to general confidentialiy
provisions, those terms will include (1) the access will not cover any
international weather data that may be added to the system during the term
of use through December 31, as our costs associated with such data are
uncertain and (2) the use of the model will be for Enron internal purposes
only with no data or analysis results to be shared with third parties.

I would appreciate if you can forward this to your legal dept. to review so
that we can hopefully get this resolved quickly.

Thanks/regards

Paul

Sorry I didn't call you last weekend.  How's everything at the office?  Is 
Julia back yet?  I wrote her a card and I hope that over the next few weeks 
and months she can grieve and at the same time get on with her life.  I 
really feel for her.  Keep me posted on how she's doing?  What have you and 
Ric been up to?  Charles and Arthur are doing great.  Bill's mom is here for 
a visit and we are having alot of fun.   I had lunch with Kristina last week 
and she updated me on the "Enron" happenings.  Seems like every week there is 
a major organizational announcement.  Where do you think Scott Sefton will 
end up?  She seemed to thing that he might take the compensation package that 
apparently was offerred to him.  It was good to talk to her and get back in 
touch with work.  I'm still playing alot of tennis and really enjoying it.  
Charles is now old enough for the daycare that our tennis club provides so 
Bill and I go out there quite a bit in the morning to hit which is nice.  i 
still don't know what my long range plans are and will probably start 
discussing with Bill what to do in the next few weeks.  It's hard to believe 
that I have been out for over 3 months.  time really does fly by.  

Give my best to everyone and write back when you can.  Did Stacy have her 
baby yet?

[I'll see you at approx. 1  p.m. today right?] 

Re the below, contact the credit group to see if they can speedily resolve 
the credit issues so as to bring the EEI to bear on the transansaction, 
clearly the best result.  Credit will also indicate whether the size of the 
trade is such that they want to insist the trade is done under a completed 
EEI Master, rather than being documented the 'old way' and then brought under 
the EEI Master upon its completion.  If the trade will be completed under the 
Tariff, you'll want to look at the Tariff to see what underlying terms you're 
dealing with (e.g., 1 year limit on term of trade completed under the Tariff, 
availability of LDs for a trade involving LD energy, etc.)

If not already known to you, Genia or Elizabeth may have input on where 
things stood in Janice's negotiations with CP&L.

Rod:

There are 2 open issues on Dresdner Bank:

1. Netting - they are saying that operationally they cannot net across 
product lines.  Are you okay with this?

2. Calculation Agent - they want to be the Calculation Agent.  Since we have 
no CSA with them, this means that they would be doing all of the calculations 
required under each transaction that we enter into with them.    
Specifically, the CA does the following:

- calculates the Floating Price and the Floating Amount, Fixed Amount or Cash 
Settlement Amount payable
- gives notice of Settlement and Payment Dates
- determines whether a Market Disruption Event has occurred

Also, my notes indicate that we agreed to increase the Guaranty  cap to 
$25,000,000 from $15,000,000.  Is that okay with you?  They had initially 
requested no cap.


On Reliant Energy Services, Inc., you were going to think about the following 
credit issues:

1. Specified Transaction - they want to include physical energy deals.  You 
were going to think about this and whether we needed a cap.  They wanted to 
amend the definition of Specified Indebtedness to deal with this, but I think 
you and I felt taht it should be dealt with in the definition of Specified 
Transaction.

2. Cross Default threshold - is 3% of equity okay?

3. On Credit Event Upon Merger, they want to define "materially weaker" as 
either (1) being below investment grade by either S&P or Moody's or (2) being 
failed to be rated by either S&P or Moody's.

4. On setoff, they did not have the "affiliate" language.

5. In the CSA, they want the collateral that is posted to secure both 
financial deals and physical gas and power deals entered into between ENA and 
Reliant Energy Services, Inc.

6. In the collateral threshold, they have proposed a matrix of S&P and 
Moody's ratings, with the threshold amount being the lower of the 2 ratings.

AA-/Aa3 and above  $20,000,000
A-/A3 to A+/A1   $15,000,000
BBB/Baa2 to BBB+/Baa1  $10,000,000 
BBB-/Baa3  $5,000,000

 Also, they have defined MAC  to be going below BBB- by S&P or below Baa3 by 
Moody's or a failure to be rated by either S&P or Moody's.


7. In the LC provisions, they have different cure periods for each of the 
types of Letter of Credit Defaults that can occur.  Here is a summary of the 
events and the time periods for transferring substitute colateral:

- If issuer's credit rating is downgraded - 1 business Day after written 
demand by the Secured Party
- if issuer fails to comply with its obligations under the LC or disaffirms

This is where things stand with Talisman.  They owe me a new draft based on 
comments that I made a few weeks ago and once I get that I need to have Dave 
Forester bless all of the chnages.  I think we are close.

This morning Carol and I discussed the ETA, and I indicated our concern that
sections 2(g) and 4 be amended so TLM can rely on the information on the
Website which we use for our offer. She is going to address this with Mark
Taylor and call us back. I believe it is a matter of finding words to
satisfy both of us.

Please note that our requests in section 2 (b) and (d) will not be included,
as section 3(c) governs.

Enron also advises in section 6(b) the assignment and consent will only
apply to assignments made by TLM not Enron, and our remedy would be to stop
using the website until we were satisfied with their assignee.

Carol and I also discussed the possibility of having a letter agreement with
the Amended ETA attached,(rather than an 'exceptions' letter), which would
be the governing doc once we 'click'.

I believe we are very close to concluding this.

Best regards
Anne

I've talked to John this morning and am working to finalize my agency 
language.  FYI, my preference is to set up GPU with 3 separate passwords -- 
GPU Service Inc. as agent for Met Ed, GPU Service Inc. as agent for Penn, and 
GPU Service Inc. as agent for NJ.  Pending resolution of Enpower bridging 
issues this afternoon, I intend to precede along this path since GPU is 
amenable.  Do you think we should have GPU execute 3 separate ETA Amendments 
in each capacity separately or do you think we should have them sign 3 
password applications and execute one ETA Amendment relating to all three 
capacities.

Hi Carol:

Enclosed is latest draft.  Please note that I changed DB's Threshold at A+
to bring it into line with Enron's rating.  I also added a sweep-in clause
to deal with the BT Transactions (Section 18).  Please let me know if those
provisions are acceptable.  Subject to internal DB approvals, I think the
other substantive points still open are (i) a Moody's rating for the MAC
clause, (ii) the demand section in the Guaranty, and (iii) determining the
L/C provisions and mechanics.  Please let me know who your replacement on
this matter will be and, if we don't speak before you leave, good luck and
congratulations.

Regards,

Steve

Hi Carol:

Thanks for the comments.

1.  The materiality language in the cross-default is DB policy, which we
cannot change.

2.   For CEUM, I will need to get treasury and credit approval.

3.   We should be able to work something out for same product netting.

4.  Should be ok.

Regarding the guarantee, we need to discuss the demand section.  With
respect to the defences, let me propose a compromise--namely that the
Guarantor can raise whatever defences it could have raised had we dealt
directly with the Guarantor as Counterparty.  Anything more than that,
would be a subjecting DB to additional  risk.

Regards,

Steve

Original Message from Carol.St.Clair@enron.com @ HUB on 05/30:





Steven :
I have finally had a chance to go over the outstanding credit issues with
Rod
Nelson, our credit person, and here are his responses:

1.   We cannot agree to the additional language in the cross-default
provision.
We need a trigger that is not subject to interpretation and second-guessing
and
the language that you proposed does just that.

2.   On credit event upon merger, we would prefer to define the standard
for
"materially weaker" as below investment grade.  Is that a problem for you?

3.   With respect to payment netting, we would prefer that netting apply to
Transactions that are of the same product line (i.e. all commodity swaps).
Is
that a problem for you?  We thought that your operational issue had to do
more
with netting across product lines.

4.   In the Credit Support Annex, we would prefer that the number of days
to
resolve disputes over exposure and/or value be 2 business days instead of
1.

Fred:
Here is what we sent to Harry Stout.  Lisa has been requesting from them a 
copy of the pleadings to make sure that all of our requested changes have 
been made and as of yesterday, I don't think that she had received anything.  
I will keep you posted on the status of these amendments.  Lisa is the best 
person to advise you on the status of the bankruptcy proceedings and the 
timing of getting an order signed so that you can commence trading.

Jeff:
As I think you are aware, the Meixco and online group want to implement 
online trading for Mexican counterparties.  Are there any tax issues taht we 
should be aware of?  If we conduct online trades using ENA and telephone 
trades with an Enron Mexican entity, will the exercise of setoff rights 
create any tax issues?   My understanding is that the Enron counterparty will 
be ENA.

I need your help regarding the above counterparties  As you probably know, at 
the holding company level, BT and Deutsche merged so that now bankers Trust 
is a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank AG.  ENA has a Master with BT and we are 
negotiating one with Deutsche.  Their attorney informed me today that it was 
his understanding that all new trades should be confirmed with Deutsche 
Bank.  Here is what I need to know:

1. The date of the last trade that we confirmed with BT.

2. The date of the first trade that we have confirmed with Deutsche.

3. A copy of the Deutsche confirm that we are being sent.


Thanks for your help.

Hi everyone. 

I have volunteered as a campaigner for the United Way here at ENRON because I 
wanted to give-back to the organization that was instrumental in my father's 
comfort during his hospice.  I hope that you  will join me in achieving Ken 
Lay's goal of 100% participation by Wednesday, August 23.  

ENRON has created a home page making it very convenient to make a pledge.  
Please take a FEW minutes and visit http://unitedway.enron.com to make your 
confidential pledge.  

If you experience any problems entering the system please contact me at 
X57373 immediately.  We are in the process of ironing out a 'glitche' or 
two.  

Remember, No gift is too small.

Thank your for your consideration.

I'm hoping that you can help me with this.  One  of the gifts that I received 
on Friday was 2 outfits from Baby Gap.  There was no card.  The only people 
that were at the shower that I couldn't account for based on the gifts that I 
received with cards and group gift list that I saw were Anne Yaeger, Mark 
Taylor, Tana Jones and Mary Heinitz.  Could you please confirm for me that 
these people did not participate on the group gift?  Thanks.

		 Subject: Re: IPPI ISDA - Response To 5/29 E-Mail

Jack:
Thanks for your e-mail.  I met with our credit people this morning and can 
respond to some of the credit points raised in your May 16th memo:

1. With respect to item #2, I know of no case law on this point and our 
credit group cannot agree to delete this concept from the Collateral 
Threshold definition.  

2. With respect to item #3, we can agree to define materially weaker the way 
you suggested with  additional language that states that any drop below BBB- 
also counts as a trigger.

3. With respect to item #4, we can agree to a definition tied to an objective 
rate which my credit person is thinking about.

4. With respect to item #6, I'm waiting for my credit person to confirm that 
your comment is correct.

5. I understand from your latest e-mail that no changes will be made to the 
definition and use of affiliates in any of the agreements.

6. With respect to item #12, we can agree to increase our rounding amount to 
$500,000 and to limit "returns" of collateral to once a week.  We cannot 
agree to change  the frequency for requesting/delivering collateral.  Given 
the high rounding intervals, we feel that unless there is a huge market 
change, it is unlikely that collateral requests will be made every day.

7. With respect to item #14, there is no requirement to escrow cash 
collateral that is being held and the Secured Party is free to do whatever it 
wants to with the cash until the events in 13(g)(ii) occur, in which case the 
cash collateral must be held by a Qualified Institution.

8. With respect to item #19, if we draw the entire amount of the LC and the 
termination amount that we are owed is less than the LC amount, we would be 
required under the documents to return any excess amount to you.  All we are 
doing in an Event of Default situation is converting the LC into cash 
collateral that we hold subject to the terms of the documents.

9. We can agree to make the chnages that you requested in item #18.

I still need some clarification on the point you were making in item #17 and 
I will look at your other comments in today's e-mail and respond shortly.  
Are you okay with the Enron and Inland forms of Guaranty?

Adele and Maria:
Here are my final comments:

1. In the ISDA Schedule, Part 4, Section (f)(iii), we cannot accept a 30 day 
waiting period.  Why can't the Guaranty be furnished when the Reorg becomes 
effective?

2. In each Guaranty, there is an extra zero in the "cap" amount.

3. In the PSE&G Guaranty, the Counterparty notice section should be just like 
what is in the Master for primary notices and copies.

4. In the LC, in the new language on the second page, change Uniform Customs 
to UCP.

That's all I have.  Subject to resolving point #1, please e-mail to me the 
Enron Guaranty and please coordinate with Susan Flynn on getting final 
versions executed and obtaining other closing items.  I will review your 
opinion shortly.

Stacy:
I spoke with John about this.  I think in the Master Physical language we 
need to do 2 things to the existing language:

1. Clarify that the exposure that is being subtracted from $50M is ENA's 
Exposure.  The defined term in the ISDA is "Exposure".

2. Clarify that Counterparty's threshold is zero if as a result of 
subtracting ENA's Exposure from $50M you get a negative number.

We will go ahead and draft the multi-product guaranty and copy you on the 
draft that we send out.

Carol,  

Sorry for the confusion.

1) Yes - the guaranty should cover both contracts - $75MM to cover the 
aggregate $50MM threshold.
2)  I spoke with Jeff Hodge on whether or not this would work prior to 
sending worksheets to you guys.  The idea is that there is a $50MM aggregate 
threshold for the counterparty.  The ISDA will be a normal ISDA - with a 
$50MM threshold.  The Master Physical will be the document that needs to be 
customized to the new concept.  The Master Physical threshold language is to 
simply read that there is a $50MM threshold less any exposure under the ISDA 
collateral threshold.  I understood that Stacy or Jeff would adapt the Master 
Physical to address any legal language differences in the contracts  - i.e. 
"Exposure", "Termination Amounts" etc.   Your team needs only to provide the 
ISDA to Stacy Dickson's group, and I believe they will draft the Master 
Physical to their comfort level.  

Please call me to confirm whether or not you need anything else on this  - 
and whether or not you think it can go out today.  

Thanks,

John

Subject: Energen

Brad and John:
We have not sent out the ISDA draft on energen because I need calrification 
on the following points:

1. Is the $75MM Guaranty cap meant to cover both physical and financial 
combined or are we doing separate Guarantys each with a $75MM cap amount?

2. How does the $50MM collateral threshold work?  I noticed in the physical 
master that it appears as if we subtract from the $50MM threshold our 
exposure under the ISDA to arrive at the Counterparty's threshold, although 
the language in the physical says "the exposure" and it is not clear whose 
exposure they are talking about.  Is that how it is suppposed to work?

Fast response, I know.  I was sending a message to Travis when yours came in, 
so I'll reply right away.  I would like to put in $35 if that is okay with

Hi Carol:

Good to hear from you again.  It is 4th quarter-as-usual around here.  Sorry 
I didn't get back to you earlier about Suzanne, but yes, I am interested in 
chipping in on that.  It's a great idea, and Suzanne should love it!  Let me 
know how much I should contribute.  As for your nanny question, I can't help 
you there.   Have you asked Stacy Dickson if she is using an agency, or 
whether her sister used an agency?  They are much more recently in the market 
for this.  Hope they can help you out - good luck!  I am sure it is not going 
to be easy to come back.  Have you set a date for your return yet?

Just 2 thoughts on the new draft:

1. In the definition of Global Early Termination Date, how does this work 
with the new Section 16 concept that Alicia has added to the Schedules 
whereby the termination of Transactions that raise Section 16 problems may be 
delayed?

2. Does Section 5.06 conflict at all with the proviso in the Limitation of 
Liability sections of both Schedules?

Here is my stab at a form of confirm reply letter.  This one assumes that we

to keep the renewal language in.  Please let me know if this draft is okay 
with you and then we will coordinate getting it executed.  Thanks for your 
help.

Enclosed is Alan's response to the draft.

Do you know if Enron Corp is prepared to execute a similiar guarantee?

I believe that the introductory sections on liquids could be expanded to 
include, SO2 and NOx and other emission credit trading, coal, bandwidth and 
pulp, paper and other wood products trading.

I think this is a very good idea. I assume that Corp. will be willing to sign 
a reciprocal form of this Guaranty.

Yes, I believe coal, emissions, bandwidth and pulp & paper (?) should be 
added to the form in the "Transactions" paragraph as bracketed language that 
could be used as appropriate. Harry, I assume you will handle developing the 
language and submitting to Carol. 

Do you know if Corp. has signed off on the form yet?

Please find attached for your review and approval a new multi-commodity 
guaranty, which has been developed by Carol St. Clair. This new form would be 
used for power, gas and liquids transactions.

I believe that it could also be used for emissions and coal transactions

Jeff has already signed off on this new format.

		 Subject: Multi Purpose Form of Guaranty

Jeff, Stacy and Harry:
 We have developed a form of multi-product counterparty Guaranty that is a 
little different from our old form of counterparty Guaranty.  The main 
difference is the deletion of the 15 day cure period in Section 2.  Can you 
please take a look at this and let me know if you are okay with this as 
something credit can send to counterparties?
Thanks.

the credit people need to talk about this, Tanya Rohauer's number is

Hi Carol.  I will review the comments promptly (I've been on vacation so
any delay was fine by me).  Regarding the cross-default, I will need to
discuss it internally, and get approvals, but the collateral provision is
not a core policy so we will certainly think about it.  In any event, now
that we're getting close, I think it may be a good to have another
converstation to discuss where we are on the remaining issues. Please let
me know your availability.

Thanks and regards,

Steve

I am faxing you our remaining comments to the schedules.  Looks like the
only
open points relate to :

1.   the additional cross-default language.  Have you had a chance to think
about what I e-mailed to you?

2.   DB, pursuant to our request, is considering refining the "materially
weaker" standard in Credit Event Upon Merger to specify a ratings test.

3.   Insertion of our Rider 7 into the ISDA Schedule regarding confirmation
procedures.

4.   DB reviewing LC language and our comments to the Enron Guaranty.  I
guess
we still need to discuss the :defenses" language because as I indicated to
you,
I'm not sure that your compromise works for us.

I look forward to hearing from you and sorry for the delay.

Some of the people in your group may not be aware of the latest forms that we 
use for the Enron Guaranty, the Counterparty Guaranty and the letter of 
credit form that we use for the ISDA, Omnibus, Industrial Master and Deemed 
ISDA forms.  enclosed are those forms.  We will discuss them with the group 
tomorrow, but could you circulate them to the group?  Alos, in light of all 
of the counterparty visits taht are occurring, should we send to the group a 
form of confidentiality agreement taht they can send to the counterparty?  
The practice lately has been for us to see the counterparty form and our 
preference would be to use our form.  Let me know what you think.
Carol

Enclosed is a draft of the CA agreement.  I spoke with DSavid this morning 
about the point that you had raised as item #3 in your last e-mail and given 
what Enron has done and might in the future do in this area, from a legal 
standpoint, I cannot get comfortable placing any further limitations on Enron 
in this agreement other than the disclosure and use limitations that are 
currently in the CA which we feel should protect RMS.  Ones interpretation of 
what is meant by "creating derivative works of" the data is to ambiguous for 
me to feel comfortable putting ahytning further in this CA.  I look forward 
to hearing from you.
Carol

I think that 2 minor chnages need to be made to the Enron Guaranty and
probably
the PSE&G Guaranty:

1.   Change in the first paragraph "Enron North America Corp., a Delaware
corporation to Enron North America Corp., a Delaware corporation and its
successors and assigns

2.   In the definition of "Agreement" include language that would pick up
amendments, supplements, replacements and restatements thereof so its reads
:"such ISDA Master Agreement, together with each Confirmation exchanged
between
the parties thereto and together with any and all amendments, supplements,
replacements and restatements thereof, hereinafter the "Agreement")

Let me know if you have a problem with this.

My understanding is it stayed with Columbia and we have continued to transact 
under it.  I do not know The New Power Company; Brant would probbaly be the 
best person to review the credit and determine if we are OK with the 
assignment.  Why are they sending us "notification" - don't they need to 
obtain our consent?

Thanks,
Tanya

Tanya:
When the Columbia purchase was done in January, did the 1/30/98 ISDA Master 
between ENA and Columbia Energy Services Corporation stay with Columbia or 
come over to us?  The reason that I am asking is that they have sent ENA a 
letter notifying us of Columbia's transfer of its rights under such Master to 
The New Power Company, so it seems as if they believe that that Master was 
not part of our acquisition.  Who in credit needs to be aware of this if in 
fact this Master will be assigned to New Power?

Thanks.  After reviewing these agreements, we would like to see the 
Acquisition Agreement whereby the Partnership acquires its interest in the 
Trust.  Alos, we would like to confirm with Henry that after giving effect to 
all of the transactions that are described in the Master Agreement that the 
Partnership's only asset will be its interest in the Trust and the 
distributions that are made with respect to such interest.  Is that correct?  
Does the Partnership have any other source of csah flow?

Suzanne:
Just checking in with you.  I'm really looking forward to next weekend and I 
really appreciate you volunteering to bring dessert!  That was really "sweet" 
of you!  How are things?  Everyone here is doing great.  Believe it or not, 
I'm playing alot of tennis and enjoying it very much.  There are leagues at 
our club almost every morning and with Bill at home, it has given me the 
opportunity to get out of the house and play with the "girls" which is alot 
of fun for me and is helping me get back into shape.  I hate to admit it, but 
between playing tennis and doing some volunteer stuff at Arthur's school, I 
could actually get used to this sat at home stuff although I still really 
miss my work and it's going to be a tough decision when I have to make it in 
a few months.

Charles is doing great.  Wait until you see how much he has grown.  I can't 
wait for my parents visit.  I just wish that they would stay longer!  Alos, 
don't be bashful about stopping by here when you are in the neighborhood.  
The only bad times are after 7 at night.  Charles gets pretty cranky around 
that time and we are working on trying to get him to sleep more during the 
day.  Part of that is our fault for being out of the house so often during 
the day but I need to get out, otherwise I would go crazy for sure.

Before I forget, do you remember packing my gym bag, and if so, is that 
something that you can retrieve easily and bring with you next Sunday?  Some 
of my tennis shorts are in there and if there is a way for you to find it, 
taht would be great.

Well I've got to go.  Take care.

follows:
 -  # of unsigned confirms

Russell:
I will draft something up later today for you  to look at.  With respect to 
Richardson Products, the July 29, 1999 Guaranty in the second paragraph 
already picks up all ECT affiliates which would include HPL, such that any 
physical contract between ECT or its affiliates and Richardson Products II, 
Ltd. would already be covered.  Their letter mentions an April 28th 
Guaranty.  Does one exist?

Why I don't think that we need to say anything with respect to the July 29th 
Guaranty, it certainly wouldn't hurt for them to simply send us a letter 
referencing this Guaranty and stating that it is their understanding that the 
term "ECT Affiliates" as used in the Guaranty  includes Houston Pipe Line 
Company.

Here is what their letter should say to us:

Reference is made to the Guaranty Agreement dated as of September 1, 1998 
from American Central Gas Companies, Inc. ("Guarantor") for the benefit of 
Enron North America Corp. ("Enron").  By letter addressed to you dated April 
6, 2000 (the "Termination Letter"), Guarantor terminated its obligations 
under the Guaranty.  The purpose of this letter is to notify Enron that such 
Termination Letter is null and void such that no termination of the Guaranty 
by Guarantor has occurred.  In addition, Guarantor hereby agrees to amend the 
Guaranty by (1) changing the amount set forth in Section 1(b) from $1,000,000 
to $2,000,000 and (2) by changing the text of the fourth paragraph in Section 
6 to read as follows:  "This Guaranty shall terminate on the date (such date 
being the "Termination Date") that is the earlier of (a) July __, 2000 or (b) 
the effective date of any written notice of termination sent by Guarantor as 
set forth below.   Guarantor may terminate this Guaranty by providing written 
notice of such termination to ECT and upon the effectiveness of such 
termination, Guarantor shall have no further liability hereunder, except as 
provided in the last sentence of this paragraph.  No such termination by 
Guarantor shall be effective until five (5) days after receipt by ECT of such 
termination notice.  No termination of this Guaranty pursuant to the 
provisions of this paragraph shall affect Guarantor's liability with respect 
to any Transaction (as defined in the Contracts) entered into prior to the 
Termination Date, which Transaction shall remain guaranteed pursuant to the 
terms of this Guaranty."

Please acknowledge your acceptance of the terms of this letter, by signing in 
the space provided below.

Mark, Jason and Sara:

Deutsche Bank has requested that we make various "Securities Act" reps in the 
ISDA Schedule in the event that we do equity derivatives.  These reps require 
us and them to say:

1. To the extent that a Transaction involves the purchase and sale of 
securities, it will not be registered and the securities cannot be sold 
except pursuant to a reg statement or exemption.

2. Each party is a QIB or an accredited investor.

3. Unless otherwise set forth in a Confirmation, any securities that a party 
is required to deliver shall not at the time of delivery constitute 
restricted securities or be subject to restrictions on transfer.

What do you think about this?

Our credit person is fine with revising the MAC language to say taht a MAC 
would be triggered if either (1) an entity's Credit Support Provider's rating 
from S&P is below BBB- by S&P or Baa3 by Moody's or (2) if such Credit 
Support Provider fails to be rated by both S&P and Moody's.  Also, in 
Sections 4.5 and 4.6 of the ISDA Schedule we would like to change the 
reference to "Goldman Group" to "The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc."

I will have Tana Jones draft an amendment and send it to you.  Call me if 
there are any problems with the above.

Sorry about the mix-up.  I did talk to Mark Taylor and he agreed that we 
could do something to address your concerns and wanted to address what 
specific language we would be comfortable with when the next draft came and 
we had a chance to sit down with our online business person and go through 
it.  I look forward to receiving the next draft from you at which time we 
will come up with some language taht hopefully works for the both of us.

Carol, the last time we spoke, I believe you were going to talk to Mark
about accepting revisions to 2(g) and 4  and advise if we could use an
amended ETA rather than the letter of amendments. (see my note of June 6).
To close this matter, I suggest I send you the ETA later today or Wed with
the revisions we requested and include the changes you made that we agreed
with. I will also include a cover letter we would both sign that once we
'click' the ETA is executed, but not the one on screen ,but the one attached
to the letter agreement.

Thank you for your help, and trust this is the easiest way to close this
file.

Congratulations for the new baby,

For now Anne

Carol,

I've reviewed the attached questionnaire and have the following comments:

1.  Section 5. --  I am not aware of any restrictions on the ability of a 
non-Mexican entity to offer financial derivatives to Mexican counterparties 
where such countparties are "vetted" before trading commences.  It seems 
that, for so long as derivatives are not offered to the public at-large, then 
such an offerings can be made.

2.  Section 9(c) -- A withholding tax, as well as value-added tax, will apply 
to payments made by a Mexican counterparty to a non-Mexican entity pursuant 
to certain financial derivative transactions.  In addition, a non-Mexican 
entity making payment to a Mexican counterparty will be required to pay 
Mexican value-added tax pursuant to those certain transactions.  (Please 
refer to the e-mail that I sent yesterday, which indicates that payments 
pursuant to those 16 financial derivative transaction descriptions provided 
to me by Jaime Williams will not be subject to any Mexican withholding or VAT 
tax since they fall outside of the regime that would otherwise subject such 
payments to Mexican tax.)  I have been working extensively with Mexican tax 
counsel on these issues, so please consider Rich, Heather y Mueller's "No" 
response as relevant only to a tax applicable to transactions conducted 
through the internet (and not with respect to the underlying transaction).

Please call me at ext. 35777 with any questions.

Best regards.

Tanya:
Here are the credit related comments that we received from Quaker Oats' 
counsel:

1. They prefer Market Quotation instead of Loss.  This will obviously be a 
discussion point given the type of commodity that we anticipate. trading with 
them

2. They want a Minimum Transfer Amount just for them of $250,000.

3. They want to reduce rounding to $25,000.

4. They do not want the provisions of section 6(c) of the CSA to apply at any 
time.

5. They deleted the concept that a party holding an LC could draw on it if 
there was an Event of Default, meaning that we would have to wait to 
terminate and have a payment  obligation owing to us before we could draw.

6. They do not want any LC to be transferable.

7. They want the Enron Guaranty to cover our obligation to return collateral 
taht has been posted to us, which I guess means that if we didn't return 
collateral to them then they could go after Enron for that amount.  Without 
this language they would have to declare an Event of Default,  terminate and 
then go after Enron for any amount that we owed them.  To the extent that we 
were holding cash colateral, they could offset that amount against amounts 
that they might owe us.  This is an interesting issue and one that I have not 
seen before.

8. They want the Guaranty cap to be rased to $25,000,000.

Where does this ISDA stand on the priority list?  Is this something I should 
try to push forward in the next week or 2 while I am hear or can it wait?

David:
Here is the language that I would recommend for the "backup" letter that we 
discussed this afternoon that our counterparties would send to us:


We hereby confirm that the confirmations that have been sent by you to us in 
connection with the transactions that are described on Exhibit A attached 
hereto correctly set forth the terms of the transactions between 
_______________________ and Enron North America Corp. confirmed thereby.
  
In drafting this, I am assuming that the information that would be on Exhibit 
A would be something like the deals numbers and perhaps trade dates.

Jack,
We have located your Fed Ex.  sorry for the confusion.  I have skimmed 
through your comments.  Looks like most of them are credit-related.  Could we 
schedule a call with the lawyers and credit folks to wrap this up and then 
you and I can discuss remaining legal issues?  Let me know what you think as 
well as times that would be good for you and your folks.  I would guess that 
we need about 1-11/2 hours.

Mark and I were reviewing the Eligible Swap Participant rules and the 
following issue came up:

If our counterparty is a limited partnership but our credit group is relying 
on the credit of the GP, do the rules require a written guaranty from the GP 
or is it enough to rely on the fact that under law the GP is jointly and 
severally liable for the LP's obligations?  One of our counterparties is a 
limited partnership whose GP is a utility and their counsel has advised us 
that for regulatory reasons, the GP cannot enter into a Guaranty.  I look 
forward to hearing from you.

Tanya:
Thank you for suggesting the group that we talked to today.  They all seemed 
to be at the same level and hopefully got something out of what we said 
today.  I mentioned to them that you have all of the latest LC and Guaranty 
forms and that you would be sending those around to them.  I will work on the 
form of confidentiality agreement and send that to you next week.  Before I 
go on maternity leave, I will send down to you a binder with hard copies of 
all of our forms, along with the User's Guides to the ISDA and CSA.  We are 
still putting the finishing touches on the ISDA and CSA Schedules.

Could you also mention/remind the group that now Samantha Boyd's name should 
be added to all credit worksheets and Tana'a name taken off and that all day 
to day matters should be handled through the 2 Susan's and Samantha, as Tana 
is off the day to day stuff and working primarily on special projects?  
Thanks.
Carol

Party and its Affiliates against amounts owed by or to the Defaulting Party 
under the ISDA and other agreements.  Please call me once you have located 
the Metals agreement as Greg indicated to me in a voice mail that he needs an

If we get comfortable on the legal side with this arrangement, are there 
other credit issues that need to be considered?

Thanks for your message.  All El Paso wants to put in the LC form is language 
that states that the original LC will accompany any draw that is made for 
endorsement of the drawing amount and that it will be returned to the 
Beneficiary unless it is fully drawn upon.  


I don't see any problem with this and while it may be unnecessary, if it 
males them feel better to have it, i would like to keep it in.  Are you okay 
with this?

Morris,

My comments on the Master Steel Agreement are as follows:

1.   Section 3.7 - The Taxes arising at the Delivery Point should be the=20
responsibility of the Buyer rather than Seller (i.e., Seller should be=20
responsible for all Taxes applicable to the Commodity being sold under the=
=20
Master Agreement arising upstream of the Delivery Point and Buyer should be=
=20
responsible for all Taxes applicable to the Commodity being sold under the=
=20
Master Agreement arising at and downstream of the Delivery Point).

2.   Section 3.7 - The phrase "within [___] days" should be added immediate=
ly=20
before the comma in the sentence beginning "[i]f Buyer and Seller are unabl=
e=20
to reach mutual agreement...."

3.   Section 3.7 - The following sentence should be inserted before the=20
sentence beginning "If either party is exempt from Taxes...":

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party is not liable for any applicable Tax=
es=20
that are legally imposed on the other Party and that are refundable to the=
=20
other Party, including without limitation value added or goods and services=
=20
taxes.

4.   Section 9 - The following sentence should be added to the definition o=
f=20
Delivery Point:

For purposes of  transactions involving an Option on the Commodity, the=20
Delivery Point shall be defined to mean the date of delivery to the Buyer o=
f=20
written confirmation of the purchase and sale of the Option, which date sha=
ll=20
be in all cases not earlier than one day following the day of acceptance of=
=20
the Counterparty=01,s offer.

5.   Section 9 - The phrase "goods and services taxes," should be added to=
=20
the definition of New Taxes immediately after the phrase "value added taxes=
,".

6.   Section 9 - The words "value added, goods and services," should be add=
ed=20
to the definition of Taxes immediately after the word "use,".

Please let me know if you have any questions or need any additional=20
information.

Best regards,
Susan

Susan,

Can you please take a look at the attached steel master agreement  and=20
provide any additional language that you think is necessary (I imagine it=

should work similar to the paper and pulp master that we discussed).  My=20
concern with the steel master is twofold: (i) it will be used for=20

foreign jurisdictions.  Thanks for your help.

I would prefer to wait until next Tuesday to meet, particularly in light of 
the luncheon with your group that we are having.  Is that okay with you?  In 
the meantime, I am working with credit to finalize the SG Interests Master 
and when I asked Sara about Williams, she indicated that she had not spoken 
with them about confirmation issues.  Do we have a contact there?  I also 
have a call into Morgan.  Finally, I mentioned to Mark Taylor how we were 
trying to prioritize our list and he identified 2 other categories in 
addition to # of unsigned confirms and Exposure amounts.  He thought that it 
was important to only focus on those transactions that were greater than 1 
year in duration from the outset and also to focus on those counterparties 
who have never signed confirms.  Can you add these to your list of categories?

Thankyou for the attached.  I believe the governing law for each issuing
surety will be the law where the surety is domiciled, but let me do some
checking and confirm this.  Also, will get back to you on your comments Re
the language in our recommended bond form...probably Monday or Tuesday next
week.  Thanks for your continued efforts in this matter.

Bill:
I spoke with our outside counsel yesterday and we have some more follow up
work that we need to do on our side.  One issue that may be of some
importance to us in our analysis is determining what the governing law of
the surety bond will be for each issuer, and more importantly, whether we
can have the bonds governed by Texas law.  Can you answer this for me?

Also, with respect to the form of the bond itself, as we mentioned at the
meeting, the language in the third paragraph which states that "if the
Principal shall promptly and faithfully provide the Firm energy as defined
in the Confirm, hen this obligation shall be null and void," does not work
for us.  Has anyone come up with alternative language?  Finally, with
respect to the Notice of Claim, we would like for the certification to say
something like, "an Event of Default has occurred under the Master
Agreement" rather than tie it to a specific default under the Confirmation.
Does that work for the sureties?

I look forward to hearing from you.

		 Subject: New Master Form

Attached you will find the latest draft of the new Master Form.  Please 
review and send me any comments today--we'd like to get this out to the 
business team by 3:00 today.  I think all of the comments we received and 
developed in the last 3 meetings have been incorporated, including the 
bankruptcy matters.  Because there are so many changes, I don't think a 
blackline would be helpful--however, let me know if you want one.   I have 
bracketed questions and open issues and highlighted areas that I think need 
either more work or extra attention from the business teams.  I'd like to see 
us be able to pare this document down just a bit--I think a 5 page master and 
a 1 to 1 1/2 page confirmation is reasonable.  Thanks.   MDS

Can you tell me if any of the more recent ETA amendment letters that we have 
sent out for execution refer to the new termination number?  My recollection 
is that maybe only 1 or 2 did.

Carol,

It looks like we may have to change the Houston terminations phone number. 
Can you tell me how many customers will be affected?

I will forward a new number once known (probably later this week). Will Tana 
be handling the change notification?

Dave

I just talked to Anthony regarding the head count and he said he still 
doesn't have a final number, but it would be 13 at the most.  Do you want a 
video conference call or polycom?  How many of our people will be there?  The 
usual group?

Here are my comments to the latest set of swap docs:

1. In the swap assignment, I think that the definition of Regulated 
Subsidiary can be deleted.

2. In Section 3.4 of the swap assignment, in the new language that was added 
at the very end, shouldn't it say after the words "Swap Agreement" "(as it 
relates to the Assigned Interest)"?  In other words, if these events as to 
Party B happen and it results in either an event of default or termination 
event under the swap, shouldn't Party A be entitled to terminate the Swap 
Agreement with respect to the portion that is not being assigned?

3. I'm assuming that the changes to Section 3.5(e) track some current cross 
default language that Enron is now using.

4. In Section 3.8, the word comments should be "consents".

Nora:
Per my voice mail message to you, I'm assuming that you are okay with Section 
5.6.

I am working with Tana on the Engage US amendment.  There should be no open 
issues, but before I left I sent some e-mails to Luke Mickum, their attorney 
which he never responded to.

Tana,
Please ask Mary Cook to review the Engage Canada Guaranty from West Coast.  
The comments that I made to the other Engage Guaranty which I have forwarded 
to you should apply here.  Has their attorney in Canada responded to  the 
Engage Canada amendment?  The latest draft of the Engage US amendment and the 
latest draft of the Engage Canada amendment I believe is still on your system 
and should be in the file, but you and Mary should both follow up with their 
attorney based on the e-mails that I sent to him which I have forwarded to 
you.

Hi Carol, 

Hope you and you newborn are doing well?  I am not sure what work issues you 
are handling, if any, but I would like to ask you if you have any further 
information on Engage.  I think Tana Jones may have been speaking to you on 
this issue.  I have received a guaranty format from Westcoast Gas Inc. to 
cover Engage Energy Canada LP.  They are waiting on our review before they 
issue the executed document.  Tana has a copy of this.  Also, I would like to 
know what outstanding issues we have with the Engage US and Canada ISDA 
amendments so I can go ahead and work to finish them up.

Hope all is well,

Russell

Your email about the lunch went to my brother, Kevin P. Radous.  Please be 
aware that his name pops up before mine does in the directory.  Also, unlike 
many other members of the credit group, I am in the Corp directory, not

trades.  Please call me to discuss.  Also, Mark Tawney and Paul Henery had 
sent up for my review a form of ELRIX GA Participation Agreement which I had 
sent them comments and questions on.  Is that related to this?  It would be 
helpful to me if perhaps you, mark and i could meet so you could explain to 
me what we are trying to accomplish.  My assistant Suzanne Adams (37340) can 
help you set something up.

Carol 

P.S.  The agreement that you sent to me refers to ELRIX Website Terms and 
Conditions and ELRIX Weather Derivatives Privacy Policy, both of which I need 
to see.

Carol, I wasn't able to open the images you attached to your email, but both
the ISDA and the Transfer and Termination Agreement are dated May 3, 2000.
The only possible concern would be those transactions that we are entering
into between May 3 and the day that the UtiliCorp ISDA is executed, at which
time we will actually enter into trades as UtiliCorp.  However, I believe
that we have worded the Transfer and Termination Agreement in such a manner
that, once such document is executed, all trades done as ARM will fall under
the UtiliCorp ISDA, so there shouldn't be any concerns.

I anticipate having the ISDA Transfer and Termination Agreement executed
within the week.  Feel free to let me know if you you have further
questions/concerns.

Rod and Brant:
I finally received their revised draft of the Schedules.  They are still 
insisting on an Additional Termination Event that gets triggered if there is 
a MAC.  As defined, MAC means a rating that is below BBB- OR Baa3 or failure 
to have a rating from either S&P OR Moody's.  I need your guidance on this.  
MAC as defined in the CSA  which triggers the threshold going to zero works 
the same way.  I seem to recall that from a credit standpoint, we were okay 
with a MAC that would be triggered if either rating fell.  Is that correct?

Carol:

I'd rather not change our standard agreement.  Specifically, the current 
definition of "Indemnifiable Tax" covers both present and future tax (as 
evidenced in the definition "Tax") and thus, necessarily, should protect the 
counterparty in the case of a "Change in Tax Law."  Moreover, Deutsche Bank's 
amendment to "Indemnifiable Tax" potentially subjects us to risk that I don't 
feel is in our best interest to assume because we don't have any control over 
the counterparty's activities.  Bottom line - I would reject the amendment.

Please let me know if you would like me to speak to their tax counsel.

Subject: ISDA Tax Issue

Rhett:
You may recall a few weeks ago I asked you about some language that one of 
our counterparties wanted as an amendment to the term "Indemnifiable Tax".  
Another counterparty, Deutsche Bank, has requested the following which I 
think is very similar to what we were looking at before:

Notwithstanding the foregoing, "IndemnifiableTax" also means any Tax imposed 
by reasons of a Change in Tax Law by a government or taxing authority of a 
Relevant Jurisdiction of the payer, unless the payee is incorporated, 
organized, managed and controlled or considered to have its seat in such 
jurisdiction, or is acting for purposes of this Agreement through a branch or 
office located in such jurisdiction.

In the ISDA Users' guide, they explain that the effect of this language is to 
eliminate the payee's risk of bearing new taxes imposed by the payer's 
jurisdiction even if the payee's activities in such jurisdiction is the basis 
for such taxes. (except if the circumstances in the definition occur).    It 
thus results in the payer having to gross up for such taxes.

Do you think that we can or should accept this?

I would prefer to wait until next Tuesday to meet, particularly in light of 
the luncheon with your group that we are having.  Is that okay with you?  In 
the meantime, I am working with credit to finalize the SG Interests Master 
and when I asked Sara about Williams, she indicated that she had not spoken 
with them about confirmation issues.  Do we have a contact there?  I also 
have a call into Morgan.  Finally, I mentioned to Mark Taylor how we were 
trying to prioritize our list and he identified 2 other categories in 
addition to # of unsigned confirms and Exposure amounts.  He thought that it 
was important to only focus on those transactions that were greater than 1 
year in duration from the outset and also to focus on those counterparties 
who have never signed confirms.  Can you add these to your list of categories?

=09=09 Subject: Weyerhaeuser Company Limited ISDA

Hi Carol,

Peter has asked me to respond to your inquiry as to whether or not we can=
=20
agree to the request of Weyerhaeuser Company Limited ("WCL") in order to=20
replace the existing securities representations (as found near the bottom o=
f=20
this e-mail) in the ISDA to:

"It is a Qualified Party within the meaning of the Ontario Securities=20
Commission, Rule 91-505 Over-the-Counter Derivatives."

>From my perspective, there are four main reasons why this amendment would n=
ot=20
be appropriate.  They are as follows:

1.  Proposed Rule 91-504 - Over-The-Counter Derivatives ("91-504") and the=
=20
corresponding companion policy have yet to be formally adopted.  At this=20
time, 91-504 is merely a proposal.  In addition to checking the Ontario=20
Securities Commission ("OSC") website, I have contacted the lawyer who firs=
t=20
brought the "securities representation" issue to our attention and he has=
=20
confirmed that 91-504 is not yet in place and there have been no recent=20
announcements by the OSC with respect to an anticipated timeline for such=
=20
adoption.

2.  Even though the WCL may trade through an office in Toronto, any trade=
=20
with Enron Canada Corp. ("Enron Canada") is likely to be considered a "trad=
e=20
within Alberta" under Alberta securities law (due to the fact that the head=
=20
office and the mind and management of Enron Canada are in Alberta).  As a=
=20
result, it is important that we get representations which address Alberta=
=20
securities law.

3.  In a similar vein to point number 2 above, a "trade" can take place in =
a=20
number of jurisdictions depending upon the particular facts of the trade. =
=20
Although it may seem unlikely, it is possible that trades could possibly be=
=20
made in jurisdictions other than Alberta and Ontario.  With the exception o=
f=20
British Columbia, I am not aware of other provinces of Canada adopting=20
similar "blanket orders", "policies" or "rules" with respect to this issue.=
 =20
However, it is usually Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia which are at t=
he=20
forefront of Canadian securities law development (with the remaining=20
jurisdictions eventually following the leaders).   I expect that, once 91-5=
04=20
is in place, we will see some movement from the remaining jurisdictions. =
=20
Regardless, it would seem prudent to leave the reference to British Columbi=
a=20
in place at this time.

4.  I think it is worthwhile to have the parties to the ISDA acknowledge th=
e=20
fact that a transaction under the ISDA will constitute an "OTC Derivative"=
=20
(and thus, have the applicable prospectus and registration exemptions=20
potentially available to them).  I can think of no reason why it would be=
=20
beneficial to either party to remove this representation.

With respect to our physical agreements, we have addressed points 1, 2 and =
3=20
above (as well as the fact that the exemptions we are relying upon are=20
provided by blanket orders and policies {as opposed to the Securities Act=
=20
(Alberta), Securities Act (British Columbia) or Securities Act (Ontario)} a=
nd=20
are, thus, more likely to be {and more easily} amended) with the following=
=20
clause:

"(i) each Transaction shall constitute a =01&commodity contract=018 or an =
=01&OTC=20
derivative=018 or such other similar term as defined pursuant to the securi=
ties=20
legislation in force in Alberta or British Columbia or pursuant to the=20
securities legislation of any other jurisdictions having application to the=
=20
Transaction, and (ii) it is a =01&Qualified Party=018 within the meaning of=
=20
paragraph 9.1 of Alberta Securities Commission Order Doc.#394043 and=20
paragraph 1.1 of the British Columbia Securities Commission Blanket Order=
=20
BOR#91-501, in either case, as amended, restated, replaced or re-enacted fr=
om=20
time to time, and pursuant to any equivalent order or other enactment made=
=20
pursuant to the securities laws of Alberta, British Columbia or any other=
=20
jurisdictions having application to the Transaction;"

I understand that similar language has not been adopted in the ISDA due to=
=20
the "open-ended" nature of the above-mentioned clause.  If we want to refer=
=20
to 91-504 and only to the blanket orders and policies currently in place, I=
=20
would suggest that we amend the existing clause, which states:

Canadian Securities Acts.  (i) Each Transaction shall constitute an =01&OTC=
=20
Derivative=018 as defined in the Securities Act (Alberta) and the Securitie=
s Act=20
(British Columbia) which have application to such Transaction and (ii) it i=
s=20
a =01&Qualified Party=018 within the meaning of paragraph 9.1 of Alberta Se=
curities=20
Commission Order Doc#394043 and/or paragraph 1.1 of the British Columbia=20
Securities Commission Blanket Order BOR#91-501(BC), as in effect on the dat=
e=20
hereof.

to:

Canadian Securities Legislation.  (i) Each Transaction shall constitute an=
=20
"OTC derivative" within the meaning of paragraph 4 of Alberta Securities=20
Commission Order Doc#394043 ("ASC 394043"), paragraph 1.1 of British Columb=
ia=20
Securities Commission Blanket Order BOR#91-501(BC) ("BCSC 91-501") and/or=
=20
paragraph 1.1 of [proposed] Ontario Securities Commission Rule 91-504 =01)=
=20
Over-The-Counter Derivatives [as published by the Ontario Securities=20
Commission on January 7, 2000] ("[Proposed] OSC 91-504"), as applicable to=
=20
such Transaction, (ii) it is a "Qualified Party" within the meaning of=20
paragraph 9.1 of ASC 394043 and/or paragraph 1.1 of BCSC 91-501, as in effe=
ct=20
on the date hereof, and (iii) it is a "qualified party" within the meaning =
of=20
paragraph 1.1 of [Proposed] OSC 91-504.

Once 91-504 is formally adopted by the OSC, the bold and square bracketed=
=20
language above should be deleted and you may want to amend the ISDAs which=
=20
were drafted using such language.   Similarly, if there are amendments to t=
he=20
Alberta or British Columbia orders or a province (other than Ontario, Alber=
ta=20
or British Columbia) which could possibly have/claim some jurisdiction with=
=20
respect to a transaction under the ISDA issues a similar order or policy, y=
ou=20
may want to amend the clause (and possibly, the pre-existing ISDAs).

I hope this discussion is useful for you.  If you have any questions, pleas=
e=20
do not hesitate to give me a call.  I can be reached directly at (403)=20

Tana:
As we discussed, here is my list of amendments that are according to my 
records in various stages of negotiation:

1. Allegheny energy - Patricia Clark sent to Frank Davis her comments on June 
15th by e-mail.  I responded on June 19th and have never heard back from 
her.  Most of her comments we could not accept.  None of her comments have 
been run by Dave.

2. Imperial Oil -  Grant Oh was handling this.  They had 3 comments. most of 
which we could not accept.  I spoke with Grant about this around June 6th and 
have never heard back from him.  None of their proposed changes have been run 
by Dave.

3. Kennecott Coal Sales Company - A draft amendment letter which Dave F. has 
approved was sent to them on May 15th.  My contact there is Jim Sobule  Wayne 
Gresham is alos involved in this.  I have never heard back from Jim. 

4. Arco - We received by e-mail comments from David Dyck at Arco in March.  
Tori Kuykendall and Grant Oh are involved from the Enron side.  I responded  
to David Dyck by e-mail on March 10th and have never heard anything further 
on this.  None of their comments or my response has been reviewed by Dave.

5. Chevron - Canada - I received a letter from Bruce Borwick  on January 31st 
which I responded to and have never heard anything further from them.  Dave 
has not reviewed their comments or my response.

6. Cargill - I sent to Mike Pederson a form of amendment letter which I don't 
think has been signed.  They wanted a minor change to the confidentiality 
language.  Dave has not seen this but in the event that Cargill comes back to 
life, i doubt that he will have a problem with it.

7. Cinergy - I sent a draft amendment letter which dave approved to John 
Dirheimer on May 15th.   To my knowledge it has not been signed.

8. Duke Energy - I sent a draft amendment letter to John Puett on May 15th 
which Dave approved.  To my knowledge, it has not been signed.

9. Talisman - we have been exchanging drafts of a revised ETA for months.  My 
contact there is Ann Love.  We are close to reaching agreement with them and 
mark has been involved in some of the early discussions.  I am sending to 
Dave a mark-up of the revised agreement for his approval.


All of the ETA amendment letters and the Talisman revised ETA are in my 
directory under specproj/online.

Here is a draft of the ETA amendment letter that we have been discussing with 
Kennecott.  It includes my proposed modifications to deal with giving them 
the termination right which I have highlighted.  The current ETA states that 
all notices become effective immediately.  I have inserted in my language a 3 
day period after we receive a termination notice before it becomes 
effective.  This creates a difference between Us and our Counterparty's since 
our termination notice would become effective immediately.  What do you 
think?  Do we need this 3 day period or are you okay with having their 
termination notice becoming effective on the date of our receipt?
Carol

I have forwarded this to Rod Nelson in our credit group.   On the Guaranty 
defenses issue, one of our  biggest concerns is getting the benefit of ENA's 
setoff rights.  I'm not sure that your solution protects us but let me give 
it some more thought and discuss this with Enron's general counsel.  Let's 
wait to talk until I am able to address all of the issues that I am 
responsible for.

Hi Carol:

Thanks for the comments.

1.  The materiality language in the cross-default is DB policy, which we
cannot change.

2.   For CEUM, I will need to get treasury and credit approval.

3.   We should be able to work something out for same product netting.

4.  Should be ok.

Regarding the guarantee, we need to discuss the demand section.  With
respect to the defences, let me propose a compromise--namely that the
Guarantor can raise whatever defences it could have raised had we dealt
directly with the Guarantor as Counterparty.  Anything more than that,
would be a subjecting DB to additional  risk.

Regards,

Steve

Original Message from Carol.St.Clair@enron.com @ HUB on 05/30:





Steven :
I have finally had a chance to go over the outstanding credit issues with
Rod
Nelson, our credit person, and here are his responses:

1.   We cannot agree to the additional language in the cross-default
provision.
We need a trigger that is not subject to interpretation and second-guessing
and
the language that you proposed does just that.

2.   On credit event upon merger, we would prefer to define the standard
for
"materially weaker" as below investment grade.  Is that a problem for you?

3.   With respect to payment netting, we would prefer that netting apply to
Transactions that are of the same product line (i.e. all commodity swaps).
Is
that a problem for you?  We thought that your operational issue had to do
more
with netting across product lines.

4.   In the Credit Support Annex, we would prefer that the number of days
to
resolve disputes over exposure and/or value be 2 business days instead of
1.

I am in the process of reviewing the new drafts of ISDA and CSA Schedules
and
will get back to you shortly on remaining comments.

Carol

I don't know if you are still handling this.  We are close to getting this 
finalized.  One credit comment from them that I need someone's thoughts on.  
They want the Issuer of LC's to maintain a credit rating of A from S&P and A2 
from Moody's.  We usually put A- and A3.  are you okay with this?  If I need

Carol  - If Enron Corp. could date the guaranty the same day as the
Agreement - June 8, 2000 - I think that would work best.

I sent to Luke Mickum a new draft of the Engage US amendment.  He never did 
send me his comments.  The file with the new draft will be with the files 
near the window just in case.   He wants to resolve the US one before we 
resolve the Canada one.  Coastal is now going to Guaranty the US one.  I'm 
not yet sure if they will also Guaranty the Canada one so we might end up now 
with 2 separate guarantys.  I'll keep you posted.

Mark

Not sure of your exact email address but hopefully one of these is correct.
Can you please confirm that you receive this?

Below is the agreement our attorneys have drafted for the transfer of the
www.weather-desk.com domain name.  Note that they have recommended that a
few of the more specific details regarding the corresponding Enron usage of
the RMS weather model be addressed in a simple but separate license
agreement.   As discussed, in addition to general confidentialiy
provisions, those terms will include (1) the access will not cover any
international weather data that may be added to the system during the term
of use through December 31, as our costs associated with such data are
uncertain and (2) the use of the model will be for Enron internal purposes
only with no data or analysis results to be shared with third parties.

I would appreciate if you can forward this to your legal dept. to review so
that we can hopefully get this resolved quickly.

Thanks/regards

Paul

If you are still at this address, I will try to get you a redraft based on

to go from there.

Have you done any memos outlining the changes to Article 9 and if so, is it 
something that we can see?  Also, is it your view that  New York will adopt 
the new Article 9 and if so, when?  Finally, given the fact that Enron's 
primary type of collateral are LC's and cash, and we rely on perfection by 
possession, do you think that there is anything about the new Article 9 that 
we should be worrying about?  If this question requires more time to analyze 
let's talk first.  Thanks.

Rhett:
You may recall a few weeks ago I asked you about some language that one of 
our counterparties wanted as an amendment to the term "Indemnifiable Tax".  
Another counterparty, Deutsche Bank, has requested the following which I 
think is very similar to what we were looking at before:

Notwithstanding the foregoing, "IndemnifiableTax" also means any Tax imposed 
by reasons of a Change in Tax Law by a government or taxing authority of a 
Relevant Jurisdiction of the payer, unless the payee is incorporated, 
organized, managed and controlled or considered to have its seat in such 
jurisdiction, or is acting for purposes of this Agreement through a branch or 
office located in such jurisdiction.

In the ISDA Users' guide, they explain that the effect of this language is to 
eliminate the payee's risk of bearing new taxes imposed by the payer's 
jurisdiction even if the payee's activities in such jurisdiction is the basis 
for such taxes. (except if the circumstances in the definition occur).    It 
thus results in the payer having to gross up for such taxes.

Do you think that we can or should accept this?

		 Subject: Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corporation - UK and US swaps

Rod,

Enron North America is looking to enter into power swaps with Kaiser Aluminum 
& Chemical Corporation starting June 2001.  I'm seeing in the credit system 
that MG plc has forward financial metals positions with Kaiser, however I 
need clarification on whether the swaps are done with Kaiser Aluminum & 
Chemical Corporation or Kaiser Aluminum International Inc.  Secondly, is 
there a Master ISDA Agreement governing those swaps?  In pulling the mtm 
monthly breakout, it appears that MG plc is OTM north of $10MM US and the 
liquidation of that portfolio occurs mostly in cal '02.

Given Kaiser's limited credit line, I'd like to look into the potential of 
setting off financial exposures in the UK and US in cases of default.  Kaiser 
is looking at other businesses with Enron and this could be quite fruitful to 
tap into in order to increase trading liquidity going forward.

In summary, we need to answer at minimum the following:
? confirmation of which Kaiser entity is financial transacting with MG plc
? volatility of the metal positions that go out to Jan '04 to ensure how 
quickly this out-of-the-money position can move
? what type of paper is confirming the swaps (whether long-form confirms or 
Master ISDA)
? what credit/legal terms and laws may affect our efforts to establish a 
Netting Agreement for UK and US financial

Can you help me in coordinating a meeting with London legal/credit and 
Portland credit/Houston legal to discuss pertinent issues associated with a 
Netting Agreement between Kaiser (single entity or multiple entities) and 
Enron entities (MG plc and ENA) as soon as possible.  Please let me know your 
thoughts to the above and who we need to contact to get the above points 
addressed.  In Houston legal, Carol St. Clair is available to work on the 
drafting of such a Netting Agreement and is speaking with Sara Shackleton 
about the concept as well.

Please let me know as soon as possible your comments to the above and in 
setting up a conference call to push this forward.

Thanks,
Tracy

Jim Crump met with Mike Sullivan and Julie Beck yesterday and it appears as 
if based on the e-mails that we have exchanged that the next step is to have 
a conference call to finalize the ISDA and the remaining open issues.  What I 
plan to do by tomorrow is circulate a redraft of the Schedules.  Julie and 
Mike agreed that David Turpin should partic ipate in the call so that all 
open issues can be resolved.  Could you please contact my assistant, Suzanne 
Adams, at 713-853-7340 and give her some days and times next week that you 
and David are available.  I would think that we would only need an hour.  I 
plan to have Ken Curry, my credit person, with me for the call.  Thanks.

CP&L has marked up a confirm that we sent to them for a deal that was done 
5/8/2001 to make it subject to their 5/18/98 Tariff agreement.  We are in the

Jeff:
Who on the commercial side is deciding who the CA would be?  As I explained 
to Nora yesterday, I think that the Enron CA should the Enron entity whose 
commercial people will be in charge of this deal after it is closed.  As far 
as 2(c) is concerned, would this require us to hand over confidential 
information?    Is Section 3 the business deal if someone other than Enron is 
the CA?  With respect to Section 7, in Section 7(a) shouldn't the term "Event 
of Default" be tied to the Events of Default in the Swap Assignment?  With 
respect to Sections 7(b) and (c), I just want to make sure that everyone is 
okay with the events that could lead to the removal of Enron as the CA since 
I would think that this is something that we would not want to happen.  For 
example, 7(b)(ii) seems to be a trigger that could accidentally happen and 
the removal of Enron as the CA seems to be a harsh penalty.  I'll defer on 
this to whatever you and the commercial folks want to do.

 An Enron entity will be Calculation Agent.  Do you have concerns
about Sections 2(c) and 7?  The latest draft is the June 9 draft, but we are
still commenting on it.

Jeff:
Has there been any discussion on our side with who the Calculation Agent
would
be?  Normally, it is one of the swap counterparties.  Is this a role that
Enron
Corp. can and should perform?  With respect to the Agreement, I am looking
at a
June 2nd draft and was wondering if anyone has focused on the language in
Section 2, and in particular, Section 2(c)  and Section 7.

I'm slightly embarrassed to be asking you this, but there was one gift from 
Baby Gap that we can't seem to figure out who the "giver" was, and we've 
narrowed it down to a group that includes you.  It was 2 outfits with animal 
patterns on it.  Are you the mystery giver?

Alos, again I just wanted to say congratulations again on your engagement.  I 
am really happy for you and Trushar and wish you all the best.  I will try to 
see if we can get together for lunch before I leave.

Carol,

I am helping the Weather Desk to develop a new product (PJM Power Demand). It 
will initially be traded only internally.

I send you a presentation of the product and its description for EOL.

I think that we should schedule a time, so that we can discuss the product.

Thanks,

Claudio

I would expect that I (I use Bruce), Scot, John McGreevy and Sam Behrens 
would likely be involved.  Sam is an energy lawyer familiar with nuclear 
facilities and would be helpful with background issues.

Paul:
Did you mean to refer to dates in June?  Alos, could you let me know which
persons or persons will be handling the areas that we need covered as so
far I am only aware of you and Scott and i wasn't sure if others would be
involved.  Thanks.

I will be away from the office on business from the evening of Friday, May
12th, returning on Monday, May 22nd.  During this period, I will not have
email access for a portion of the trip and there may, therefore, be a delay
in my responding to emails sent during this period.

Jeff, I am sending you the specific information of the indexes and products 
that we believe our customers would be trading on EOL.....Please take a look 
at the file attached, and the page with Index Definitions, for the 
information you are looking for. The trades will be performed based on 
indexes taht already exist in OEL, so no new Mexican Indices will be 
included.   Please note however, that the mexican gas is priced in Mexico on 
the basis of the Tetco/Valero basket. So, most probably, that same basket 
will be included in the system to accomodate to our customer's needs. 
Please note that Carol St Clair will be helping us on the legal aspects of 
including Mexico into the EOL system.
Thanks and regards.

Aqui te mando el archivo de la lista de clientes EOL, en el mismo archivo ya

no estan en EOL: el promedio Tetco y PG&E; el poliestireno y el PET. 

Por otro lado para el polietileno esta la descripci?n para el LLDPE.

Si se requiere alg?n cambio solo avisame.

Would it be too late to suggest changes to the definition of "forward

respect to the physical supply contracts that EES enters into?  I am not sure 
what chnages we would want, but was wondering if there was any opportunity to 
suggest a change.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks.

Tim Reyes of Alcoa would like to make sure that their current master

aluminum products on EOL.  I am hoping that you are the correct person to

If you require more information Please contact Mr. Reyes at 865-594-4734.

		 Subject: RE: EPMI/Morgan Consent to assignment

Carol,

I read the assignment and reviewed our positions with Morgan and Merchant 
Energy Group of America ("MEGA").  Credit is fine with the assignment.  
However, as a result of 
MEGA assigning its trades to Morgan, our mark-to-market exposure to Morgan 
increases by approximately $27.8mm over the next 18 months.  Although we have 
agreed to post margin to each other in the past, our current Master Energy 
Purchase and Sale Agreement with Morgan does not have any STATED provisions 
for margining.  Consequently, we would like to amend the agreement to include 
collateral thresholds for both Enron and Morgan.  I will discuss this issue 
with Ed and get back to you.

Thanks,
Wendy

Their attorney finally contacted me and we talked about the ESP rules.  She 
is going to do further research in light of the fact that for regulatory 
purposes Utilicorp, the GP, cannot furnish a Guaranty.  I alos mentioned to 
her that at the very least we would like to make Utilicorp a "Specified 
Entity" so that they would be part of the credit-related Events of Default in 
the ISDA Master.  As a general rule, we recommend in circumstances where the 
counterparty is an LP and you are relying on the GP's credit, making the GP a 
"Specified Entity" so that for example their bankruptcy would trigger an 
Event of Default.  Call me if you have any questions.

Marie and I have a big fax and mailout that needs to be done this week.  We 
are trying to get as much done as possible before we leave but I will need 
your help today, tomorrow and Thursday to make sure this gets done.  The 
clerks will be faxing and I need for you and/or Marie's assistant to check 
the confirmation pages against our master list to make sure that they all 
have been sent out correctly.  We are also doing a mail out.  Could you 
please check with Marie Heard to see what you can do to help her out?

Enclosed are clean and marked revised drafts of the Schedules.  As we 
discussed, I have bracketed those sections that are still open.  Please note 
that since May, 2000 when the initial draft was sent to you we have updated 
our forms and I have included our new form language in Part 3, Sections (a) 
and (b), part 6, Sections (g) and (h), Paragraph 13 (g) and the LC form.  
Alos, I have made the chnages that you requested to the Enron Guaranty.  Are 
those chnages also acceptable for the ERI Guaranty?

I look forward to hearing from you.  I will be leaving to go on maternity 
leave at the end of this week.  In my absence, please contact Susan Bailey at 
713-853-4737 who will coordinate with another attorney in our group to get 
this finalized.

Rhonda:
Enclosed is a new revised draft of the MEGA Consent marked against the draft 
that they sent to us.  Here is what we have decided to do:

1. As a condition to our execution of this Consent, we will execute an 
amendment to the existing Master with Morgan to (a) insert collateral 
provisions and (b) clean up some of the defined terms in the MEGA confirms.  
I will draft the amendment and Christian will help you and Melissa develop 
the language for the amendment that deals with the confirm clean-up.

2. We need to know from MEGA and Morgan what the transfer effective date is 
that establishes the cutoff date for these trades as between ourselves and 
each of Morgan and MEGA.  My revised draft of the Consent makes it clearer 
how this cutoff date works.

3. We need a contact from Morgan that we can send the form of amendment to.

Call me if you have any questions.

Could you please take a look at point #6.  This is the online counterparty

are available as a remedy in any arbitration proceeding and that under no 
circumstances shall specific performance be an available remedy against 
them.  Please let me know what you think.  Thanks.

Subject: ETA Comments - Arbitration Language




Joyce:
Per my earlier e-mail message, I have had a chance to discuss your proposed
arbitration language with our litigation manager.  We can accept your
proposed
new language with the following chnages:

1.   From our language in the ETA, we need to keep in the provisions
regarding
treble, exemplary and punitive damages.  This is Enron's current policy.  I
ASSUME YOU ARE REFERRING TO THE SENTENCE:  "ONLY DAMAGES ALLOWED PURSUANT TO
THIS AGREEMENT MAY BE AWARDED AND THE ARBITRATORS SHALL HAVE NO AUTHORITY TO
AWARD TREBLE, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF ANY KIND UNDER ANY
CIRCUMSTANCES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES MAY BE AVAILABLE UNDER THE
LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK AND/OR THE FAA OR AAA."  THIS IS OK AND CAN BE
INCLUDED IN MY SUGGESTED DISPUTE LANGUAGE IN THE PARAGRAPH THAT ADDRESSES
REMEDIES.

2.   In the first paragraph of your language, we would like to delete the
last
sentence.  THIS IS OK.

3.   With respect to the selection of the arbitrators, we would like to keep
our
language that each party can select 1.  We have no problem going with your
language on selecting the third from a list.  THIS IS OK.

4.   We cannot agree that monetary damages are the exclusive remedy.  How
would
we enforce the confidentiality provisions?   We need some other way to be
able
to seek non-monetary remedies for those types of breaches.  THIS MAY BE OUR
ONLY STICKING POINT.    GENERALLY SPEAKING, THE APPROPRIATE REMEDY FOR A
BREACH OF CONTRACT CLAIM IS A MONETARY REMEDY.  IN A BREACH OF CONTRACT
CLAIM AGAINST THE U.S., THE U.S. COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS HAS JURISDICTION
(28 U.S.C. 1491).  SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE IS NOT A REMEDY AVAILABLE AGAINST
THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY HAS NOT BEEN WAIVED FOR SUCH
RELIEF.  [I DO NOTE THAT YOU DID NOT OBJECT TO THIS LANGUAGE IN MY PROPOSED
DISPUTE LANGUAGE SO I ASSUME YOU MAY ALREADY RECOGNIZE THAT FACT.]
SIMILARLY, THERE IS NO GENERAL JURISDICTION FOR THE U.S. COURT OF FEDERAL
CLAIMS TO GRANT INJUNCTIVE RELIEF IN BREACH OF CONTRACT CASES.  BONNEVILLE
IS NOT AMENABLE TO (NOR MAY IT BE LEGALLY AUTHORIZED TO) ENTER INTO
CONTRACTS THAT WOULD PROVIDE ARBITRATORS WITH AUTHORITY BEYOND THAT WHICH
CONGRESS INTENDED TO BE APPLICABLE TO FEDERAL AGENCIES.

I CANNOT ASCERTAIN FROM YOUR COMMENT WHETHER YOUR CONCERN IS THE FACT THAT
BONNEVILLE IS A FEDERAL AGENCY AND SUBJECT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION
ACT.  IF THAT IS YOUR CONCERN, I WOULD LIKE TO OFFER LANGUAGE THAT COULD BE
ADDED TO YOUR CONFIDENTIALITY PROVISION THAT MAY PROVIDE A GREATER LEVEL OF
COMFORT THAT INFORMATION THAT ENRON DEEMS CONFIDENTIAL IS NOT DISCLOSED
WITHOUT AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ENRON TO RESPOND:

"SUBJECT TO BONNEVILLE'S OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (5
U.S.C. 552, AS AMENDED), THE PRIVACY ACT OF 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), THE TRADE
SECRETS ACT OF 1988 (18 U.S.C. 1905), AND ANY OTHER APPLICABLE FEDERAL LAWS,
BONNEVILLE SHALL TREAT AS EXEMPT FROM PUBLIC DISCLOSURE ANY TRADE SECRETS
AND COMMERCIAL OR FINANCIAL INFORMATION FURNISHED PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT
PROVIDED THAT IT IS PRIVILEGED OR CONFIDENTIAL AND IS SO DESIGNATED BY
ENRON.  IN THE EVENT A THIRD PARTY SEEKS DISCLOSURE OF SUCH INFORMATION
UNDER ANY APPLICABLE FEDERAL LAW, BONNEVILLE SHALL PROMPTLY NOTIFY ENRON OF
SUCH EFFORT, AND ANY OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENRON TO PROTEST SUCH DISCLOSURE.
BONNEVILLE SHALL USE ITS REASONABLE EFFORTS TO AVOID DISCLOSURE OF ANY
PRIVILEGED OR CONFIDENTIAL COMMERCIAL INFORMATION."


I look forward to hearing from you.  My number is 713-853-3989.

have changed our form of Guaranty since the prior one was entered into and I 
would prefer that you consider using the new form.  The main difference is in 
Section 2 where we have made chnages to the mechanics for demanding payment

Guaranty that I provideed.  Enclosed is the new form.  Let me know what you

Carol -

Our legal department is in the process of reviewing the schedule, paragraph
13, and L/C provisions/schedule.  I will send you new drafts once I
incorporate comments from them. Two other things:
1.  Enclosed is a "new" format of Guarantee for your review.  Actually, this
should be similar to the 1995/6 version Enron has already accepted.
2.  I disagree with your changes in C/D threshold discussed below.   We
prefer to limit this to the Credit Support Provider (as per your original
change) as this is who guarantees the ISDA.  I have incorporated your
original comments with little change which you can review when I send the
drafts.

If you don't want the flowers, call me and I'll come get them.  These people

Thanks.  Is there a polite way to discourage flowers?  Bill is allergic and 
we just end up throwing them out after a day or 2.  Cash and diaper donations 
are always acceptable!!! (just kidding).    We have been getting alot of 
stuff and I really appreciate it.  Thank you notes were sent to you by mail.  
On my mail, just collect it and send it out once a week.  Can you please send 
those 3 white boxes to me that are in my office at the end of this weeK?  
Bill did talk to his mother and I think persuaded her to wait a few weeks 
until I'm more mobile which I am hoping will occur in a week or so.  
Hopefully by next week I can be driving.  I'm not getting much sleep but I'm 
really enjoying this experience.  I think that Charles looks like Bill with 
my nose but I will let you be the judge when you see him which hopefully can 
happen in a week or so.  I'll keep in touch and thanks again for all that you

You should be getting lots of flowers and gifts because quite a few people 
have called for your address.  I see your email is working now.  How are 
things?  Did you talk to your mother-in-law?

It's been extremely quiet over here, but Susan Bailey is going crazy.  They 
must have given her what she wanted since she's still here.  No other news.

Michele, Carol had her baby last night and had to have a csection.  Does this 
add time to her maternity leave?  What about the other 26 weeks that we are 
given for illness.  She can't use them?  Suzanne (Carol's assistant)

Hi Mark,

Please forward this information to the time-keeper in order that her time off 
will be coded  correctly. An alternative would be for Carol to complete her 
timesheets before she leaves.  With SAP this can be done in advance.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks

Michele:

Just to let you know that I have approved the following for Carol:

1. In addition to the 6 weeks that Enron allows for leave, Carol will add to 
that period by using any remaining vacation time that she has for 2000 (I 
believe an additional 10-12 days).

2. After that time is used up, Carol will be on an unpaid leave of absence 
until December 31, 2000.

Please let me know if there is anything else you need.

Mark

Rod:

There are 2 open issues on Dresdner Bank:

1. Netting - they are saying that operationally they cannot net across 
product lines.  Are you okay with this?

2. Calculation Agent - they want to be the Calculation Agent.  Since we have 
no CSA with them, this means that they would be doing all of the calculations 
required under each transaction that we enter into with them.    
Specifically, the CA does the following:

- calculates the Floating Price and the Floating Amount, Fixed Amount or Cash 
Settlement Amount payable
- gives notice of Settlement and Payment Dates
- determines whether a Market Disruption Event has occurred

Also, my notes indicate that we agreed to increase the Guaranty  cap to 
$25,000,000 from $15,000,000.  Is that okay with you?  They had initially 
requested no cap.


On Reliant Energy Services, Inc., you were going to think about the following 
credit issues:

1. Specified Transaction - they want to include physical energy deals.  You 
were going to think about this and whether we needed a cap.  They wanted to 
amend the definition of Specified Indebtedness to deal with this, but I think 
you and I felt taht it should be dealt with in the definition of Specified 
Transaction.

2. Cross Default threshold - is 3% of equity okay?

3. On Credit Event Upon Merger, they want to define "materially weaker" as 
either (1) being below investment grade by either S&P or Moody's or (2) being 
failed to be rated by either S&P or Moody's.

4. On setoff, they did not have the "affiliate" language.

5. In the CSA, they want the collateral that is posted to secure both 
financial deals and physical gas and power deals entered into between ENA and 
Reliant Energy Services, Inc.

6. In the collateral threshold, they have proposed a matrix of S&P and 
Moody's ratings, with the threshold amount being the lower of the 2 ratings.

AA-/Aa3 and above  $20,000,000
A-/A3 to A+/A1   $15,000,000
BBB/Baa2 to BBB+/Baa1  $10,000,000 
BBB-/Baa3  $5,000,000

 Also, they have defined MAC  to be going below BBB- by S&P or below Baa3 by 
Moody's or a failure to be rated by either S&P or Moody's.


7. In the LC provisions, they have different cure periods for each of the 
types of Letter of Credit Defaults that can occur.  Here is a summary of the 
events and the time periods for transferring substitute colateral:

- If issuer's credit rating is downgraded - 1 business Day after written 
demand by the Secured Party
- if issuer fails to comply with its obligations under the LC or disaffirms 
or rejects the LC - 1 Business day after the pledgor receives notice of 
dishonor
- if LC fails to be in full force and effect or issuer declares bankruptcy - 
3 Business Days after written demand by Secured Party

In our form, we require substitute collateral to be posted within 2 Business 
Days of the occurrence of the above events, except for a downgrade where the 
time period is 5 Business Days





On SG Interests, you were going to talk to them about certain credit issues.


Please let me know when you can where you stand on the above.  Thanks.

Carol

Carol - While it never too late to suggest a change, given the political 
situation I would be hesitant to offer anything more than a "clarification".  
While I would not spend a huge amount of time on it, I suggest you examine if 
there are any changes. Depending on what happens in the Senate (now that it 
is in Democratic hands), the process can be reopened and we could have an 
opportunity to offer suggested changes (or it kill the bill all together).

Would it be too late to suggest changes to the definition of "forward

I'm thrilled that you are coming.  I'll e-mail you directions soon and I 
can't wait to see you.  I'm doing well.  Believe it or not, I'm playing alot 
of tennis (word spread at our club that i was home during the day) and with 
Bill home we pretty much just "tag- team" it with Charles  and the club 
provides babysitting services which we sometimes use.  This has been a great 
outlet for me and a way to get back into shape which will take some time.  
Arthur is still very much into tennis and starting to play competitively.  
I'm just keeping my fingers crossed that he keeps it up.  As for Charles, 
he's now 13 lbs., 6 ounces and almost 23 inches long.  I have stopped 
breast-feeding and started bottle feeding him which seems to work better 
particularly at night.  He now wakes up usually just once at night and I'm 
starting to get more sleep which is nice.

Don't worry about waking anybody up when you call here.  Bill is usually here 
and Charles doesn't sleep much during the day anyway.  I've thought about 
coming up to the office a few times but  with Bill's schedule, Arthur's 
tennis and my tennis, I just haven't found a day that works.  Hopefully I'll 
get up there soon although I must sound like a broken record by now.  Hope 
you are doing well and I look forward to seeing you soon, as well as having 
you meet my parents and sister and of course see Charles again.  Talk to you 
soon.

I just wanted to thank you for the time and effort that you have spent on my

still trying to plead my case today with Cindy Benson, but I am afraid that 
the damage was done when Memorial's team captain voiced her objection.  Why 
do you think that she did what she did and won't this happen again when we 
play them?  I look forward to hearing from you.

Just wanted to get back to you regarding the one remaining issue on the ISDA 
Schedule.  With respect to Section 7 - Transfer, we would like to keep the 
original language.  We view the "credit rating" language as a one time 
exception which if we need to we can deal with separately, but any subsequent 
transfers after that we want to use the more generic language.  Can we set up 
a call to discuss this and my other comments which I sent to you?  Let me 
know some times this week that work for you.  Thanks.

Luanne:
Our credit person is fine with revising the MAC language to say taht a MAC
would
be triggered if either (1) an entity's Credit Support Provider's rating from
S&P
is below BBB- by S&P or Baa3 by Moody's or (2) if such Credit Support
Provider
fails to be rated by both S&P and Moody's.  Also, in Sections 4.5 and 4.6 of
the
ISDA Schedule we would like to change the reference to "Goldman Group" to
"The
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc."

I will have Tana Jones draft an amendment and send it to you.  Call me if
there
are any problems with the above.

Tana,
Please draft an amendment for my review.

After our meeting yesterday, I asked Mark Taylor whether under the revised 
version of the CEA there was any restriction on one's ability to cash settle 
physical transactions.  He confirmed that so long as the parties to the 
transaction are "Eligible Contract Participants", then there is no 
restriction and our physical contracts can expressly permit cash settlement.  
Enclosed is a summary of the ECP definition.

Carol - I think Valerie Mooney (our credit person) and Ed Sacks are still
discussing some minor fine tuning of the LOC format.  I spoke to Bob Bruce
this morning - we're all set on the language in the Schedule to the ISDA,
and there is a minor credit/billing issue in Paragraph 13 related to the
timing of transfer of interest on collateral that Val will discuss with Ed
as well.  As far as the EEI goes, the only remaining issue that I'm aware
of (aside from finalizing the LOC) is whether we've finished coordinating
the Attachment containing the list of prior transactions.  Sounds like we
may actually get these documents executed early next week.

Great!  The Met has 3 hour free parking - use the "yellow entrance"  to the 
Allen Center (located on the far side of the parking garage, next to all the 
open air parking lots) and follow the signs for Met parking (off to the 
right).  Met is on the 6th floor.  I can meet anytime around lunch - I'll go 
ahead and get court for 11:30, but if you want to meet later, that would be 
fine - just let me know.  Looking forward to playing.

mouth, as well as cramps.  It's not one of my better days.  I also found out 
I have to have a root canal, 8 crowns, a fortune will be spent.  Anyway, she 
said the crown stuff would take 4 hours, which means 6-8, so I was wondering 
if you thought it better for me to take off when you guys weren't around.  
The week of July 17th, you'll be gone, Mary will be on vacation and Dan will 
be on vacation.  Would that be a good time for me to be gone too since it'll 
be quiet.  I have a lot of decay and need to get this over and done with 
soon.  After that's done, I should be finished except for routine cleanings.  
She's already done both side of my mouth.  Now, it's the front that has to be 
done.  I wanted to get your input before I started scheduling appointments 
where I'll have to be out an entire day.  

The Astros won last night and we were there!!!  We brought them luck!!!!!!

Carol, 
The west desk is presently working on a deal to serve a large industrial 
customer, Knauf,  newly located within the franchise area of a tiny northern 
California municipality, The City of Shasta Lake.  It makes sense to do a 
price swap with Knauf.  Our champion, Laird Dyer, says that Knauf wants to do 
an ISDA.  This would be a perfect situation for you, with your ISDA 
background, to help me, (working on the corresponding physical piece with the 
City of Shasta) to team up and help us get this deal done.  Can you help us 
in this manner?  ----cgy

FYI.  I spoke with Lisa Mellencamp about Donald yesterday and her contact had 
nothing bad to report about him from a work standpoint.  The only negative 
comment that she had was on a personal basis as she described him as being a 
"flirt" at the firm who on occassion has taken a liking to certain female 
employees at the firm.  Apparently, with one particular employee he was quite 
a pest.

Hi Carol:

How are you doing this beautiful morning. Thanks for the telephone call last 
night. I am thoroughly happy that you are still interested in me. I was 
hoping you would be. As I mentioned to Nedre Strambler, I have been wanting 
to work for Enron for quite some time. I believe that Enron is a top class 
organization.

With regard to references, I would appreciate it if you would not contact my 
present employer at this time, but in the alternative, contact my past 
employer for references.

My immediate supervisors with Star Enterprise were as follows:

1.    Jerome (Jerry) L. Francis, Esq., Sr. Real Estate Specialist  -
       (713) 241-1823 [PLEASE NOTE, I TRIED TO CONTACT JERRY THIS MORNING AND 
HE IS ON VACATION. HE WILL RETURN TO THE OFFICE ON THURSDAY, MAY 4, 2000]; and

2.     Gary W. Dzierlenga, Esq., Real Estate Specialist  -  (713) 241-1813.

In addition to the above, you may contact the references listed on the Enron 
Job Application that I completed.

After your conversations with the above references, if you feel a need to 
speak to my current employer references, please advise.

Again thank you for your continued interest in me. I look forward to hearing 
from you real soon. I look forward to becoming a part of the "swaps and 
derivitives" group at ENRON!

Have a great day!

Don

Susan:
I'm not sure that what I told you to do in the CSA Annex with respect to 
Custodians and their qualifications work so for now let's keep it out and go 
back to our old language.

Sara and Mark:
Shari had a counterparty point out to her that in our CSA Annex language 
where we talk about the circumstances under which a party can "hold" 
collateral, all of our triggers are based on something happening to our 
counterparty and nothing is said about what would happen if a Custodian holds 
the colateral and fails to be creditworthy.  Do you have any thoughts on 
this?  At first I thought that we should require the Custodian to be a 
Qualified institution but I'm not sure that that is the right approach.  Let 
me know what you think.

Here is a comparison of our form to Clement's.  We need to use our form as it 
ties more closely into the swap agreements that we use.  Legal will dela with 
Clement if this is a problem but I suspect that it won't be.  His form, I 
suspect, is more suited for credit agreements and the like.  I am alos 
attaching our form which we distributed today for both the Enron Guaranty and 
the Counterparty Guaranty.

Has there been any discussion on our side with who the Calculation Agent 
would be?  Normally, it is one of the swap counterparties.  Is this a role 
that Enron Corp. can and should perform?  With respect to the Agreement, I am 
looking at a June 2nd draft and was wondering if anyone has focused on the 
language in Section 2, and in particular, Section 2(c)  and Section 7.

I received your voice mail.  Can someone fax to me at home a copy of the 
latest Talisman ETA amendment that Dave F. looked at?  Also, would it be 
possible to indicate on what you sent to me the parts that Dave F. didn't 
like?  It would make it easier for me to respond and less time consuming 
since I don't have much free time during the day but I'm happy to help out.  
As Mark knows, this was a highly negotiated series of amendments over a long 
period of time.  My hope is that we can work through Dave's concerns without 
having to retrade what we had agreed to on the legal side.  My fax number 
here is 281-890-8862.

My fault.  It should say "succeeding Scheduled Payment Date" and Scheduled 
Payment Date is defined in Section 14 of the ISDA form.  As far as choice of 
law, we can go with NY although I disagree with your counsel, in that in 
order for the New York choice of law to be enforced by a court, the parties 
have to demonstrate some minimum relationship with the jurisdiction chose.

Carol - two issues:  First, dealing with the applicable law, you can see
from the copies message below, from our legal counsel, that we will not
accept Texas law.  Second, I looked through my ISDA booklets and cannot find
that term "Succeeding Payment Date" defined anywhere.  Can you specify where
it is defined?

Answer from Legal:
We will not accept Texas law as the governing law over the ISDA. All of El
Paso's ISDA's are governed by New York law. The ISDA was created under NY
law by NY financial practitioners. There is substantial case law for ISDA's
using New York Law. The User's Guides reference NY case law. You do not have
to have a contact in New York. New York is not the venue, it is the
governing law.

Arbitration may be held in Houston, Texas, using New York law.

 Subject: RE: Enron ISDA review - additional

 Regarding Part 4(h) on the use of Texas vs. NY law - Enron feels
that since both Parties are Texas entities, we should use Texas law.  Carol
St. Clair (Enron attorney) feels that Texas laws are adequate in dealing
with ISDA disputes, our lawyers know Texas law, and that we both would have
to have a connection or contact in NY to use NY law.

 What is your opinion?

had a termination date of June 30, 2001.  Just want to make sure taht 
whatever is signed has a different termination date (i.e. June 30, 2002).

That is fine. I will make all of the chnages and send it around.  Also, on 
Constellation, I left a voice mail for their attorney that we have approved 
the CSP language and that I need to see their Guaranty.  What cutoff date are 
you expecting to see?  The last draft that I saw said June 30, 2001.  Is that 
acceptable?

I will take a look at this either tonite or in the morning.  Since the UEI 
Holdings Guaranty which we reference in paragraph 9 of the Amendment covered 
both US and Canada transactions, I don't think that we can say that it has 
been terminated until we sign up the Engage Canada deal.  Can you add 
language to the Coastal Guaranty that takes care of this instead.  I would 
prefer to say in paragraph 9 of the Engage US amendment that "The Guaranty of 
Party B dated as of May 19, 1997, heretofore delivered by UEI Holdings Inc., 
formerly known as Union Energy Inc. in favor of Party A as beneficiary, is 
hereby replaced by an executed Guaranty from Coastal Corporation, a copy of 
which is attached hereto as Exhibit B but only with respect to the 
obligations of party B under the Master Agreement that are guaranteed 
thereunder."  Let me know what you think.

Attached is the standard Coastal guaranty form we use for ISDAs.? I 
understand this ISDA is just for these financial instruments and not for the 
physical side of the business.? Please give me your comments, if any.

We will split the guaranty with a Coastal guaranty for Engage US and 
Westcoast for Engage Canada.?? Since the new threshold is $10 million, the 
Coastal guaranty cap is $10 million.?

Carol,

I need to fill you in on the new structure. Essentially the senior debt will 
now be Corp guaranteed and on balance sheet. The swap adjustments will 
therefore impact equity only.

We are now projecting financial close as the week of June 19th - the week I 
go on holiday!. That means preliminary offering memo for the guaranteed notes 
going out around the last week of May. By then, everything has to be 
finalised (including the swap).

Hope this helps your planning. 

All is well and will be better when Margaux closes. 

All the best with being a mum again!


     Mark

I get someone else involved.  Hope all is going well.

Richard Sanders , our litigation manager, was okay with this since this just 
defines the location of the arbitration, not necessarily who gets selected.  
With respect to your second question, I will talk to Mark about it and get 
back to you.

Carol,

- Do we really want to accept arbitration in Portland?
- What is our exposure to Federal Law?

Enclosed for your review is a draft amendment letter for the above

is a federal agency.  I look forward to hearing from you.

I agree with you.  I had thought about waiting to execute the Transfer
Agreement until after we had executed the new ISDA and (and thus were doing
all subsequent trades as UtiliCorp) and dating the Transfer Agreement
accordingly.  I think it is a more legally sound way of handling the whole
issue.  Why don't you wait until I send you the fully executed ISDA and we
have the correct name in your Enron Online database, and then redate and
send the Transfer Agreement?

Dave Forster must sign off on all ETA amendments that we do.  It may be a 
good idea for you to send him the new ETA amendment letter and walk him 
through the chnages that you have made to address your issues so that he 
understands what is going on.  If you want me to be involved in that 
conversation, I'm happy to participate.  Thanks.

		 Subject: Re: Enron Online

Cort:

I have reviewed the Mutual Assistance Agreement and am not entirely 
comfortable that it establishes the authority of GPU Services Company to 
enter into power transactions on behalf of the utilities.  The Agreement 
provides in Section 3 that "each Company . . . will furnish to such other 
Company  . . . one or more of the Goods . . ." and that "[a]ll Goods provided 
hereunder shall be priced at cost . . ."  Thus, the Agreement provides that 
the Service Company can buy power and sell it to a utility at cost.  It does 
not expressly provide that the Service Company can act as agent on behalf of 
the utilities in purchasing or selling power on their behalf.

I wanted to confirm that there was no other documentation available that more 
clearly identified the authority of GPU Services to act as agent on behalf of 
the utilities.  In the absence of such documentation, I propose language to 
add to the Electronic Trading Agreement to address my concerns.  I would also 
like to have each of the utilities sign a short acknowledgment form 
acknowledging the authority of GPU Service Company to enter into transactions 
with EPMI on its behalf.   Attached below please find my proposed revisions 
to the Letter Agreement amending the ETA (which was originally forwarded to 
you by Carol St. Clair) as well as the proposed Acknowledgment.



I look forward to discussing any questions or comments you may have.

Leslie: The Mutual Assistance Agreement that was sent to you was filed with 
the
Pa PUC . I'll check but I believe the filing to which you are referring was
originally filed with the SEC back in the early 1970's and has since been
amended a number of times.  Obviously as a part of a holding company structure
GPU Service is required to have SEC approval to provide services to our
operating companies. The GPU Service corporate records are not located here in
Reading, PA....do you really need the SEC document? Cort

 Subject: Enron Online










As I understand it, Section 13(b) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act
requires registered holding companies to obtain approval from the SEC in order
to form a service company to provide services to its affiliates in the system.
I have reviewed the Mutual Assistance Agreement that John faxed to me earlier.
Is this the Agreement which was filed by General Public Utilities Corporation
with the SEC pursuant to Section 13(b) of the PUHCA on SEC Form U-13-1 or
otherwise?

Were the following points considered or discussed prior to them turning the 
last draft?  The cross default langugae still does not work.  Why was the 
threshold lowered to $50,000,000?

What are your thoughts on this?

Subject: Swap Assignment Agreement - April 20 Draft

Jeff:
Sorry this took so long but here are my thoughts on the above:

1. In Section 3.1 (c), I'm assuming that the additional sections were added 
because we will get these reps in another agreement from the Trust.  Is that 
correct?

2. In Section 3.4 e), the new language regarding rescission of acceleration I 
think belongs after the phrase that begins, "if the effect of such 
failure..."  Also, where did the new language regarding prepayments at the 
end come from?  Is this in the Revolver or in Enron's existing deals? 

3. Section 3.11 should be made subject to Section 5.7 or vice versa.

Carol

Could you please update me on where things stand as I will be on my leave

have you had a chance to review the new draft of Guaranty that I sent to you?

Luke:
Here are my comments to the form of Guranty:

1. I thought that this Guaranty would only cover the Engage US Agreement.

2. What cap number do you plan to insert in Section 1(c)?  I'm assuming $10M 
if the Guaranty only covers Engage US.

3. In Section 6, there should be no restriction on our ability to assign our 
rights under the Guaranty in connection with any assignment of the swap that 
is done in accordance with the Master Agreement.  The restriction should only 
be on the Guarantor's right to assign.

4. Please add a section that prohibits amendments without our consent.

5. For notice purposes to ENA please add the following:

Attached is the standard Coastal guaranty form we use for ISDAs.? I 
understand this ISDA is just for these financial instruments and not for the 
physical side of the business.? Please give me your comments, if any.

We will split the guaranty with a Coastal guaranty for Engage US and 
Westcoast for Engage Canada.?? Since the new threshold is $10 million, the 
Coastal guaranty cap is $10 million.?

Mr. Stout:
I understand from your e-mail to Lisa Mellencamp that Zachary May is out of 
the office.  I am helping Lisa out on this matter as an attorney in our 
financial derivatives group.  In addition, Stacy Dickson is handling all 
matters relating to physical trades that have been done between Enron and 
KCS.  In addition to the pleadings, we are also preparing amendments to both 
the physical and financial agreements taht currently exist between the 
companies.  Last week, I sent to Zachary May a draft of an amendment to the 
financial master between Enron North America Corp. and KCS Energy Marketing.  
Stacy Dickson will be sending you a revised draft of that document that adds 
to it the amendments that we need to make to the physical agreements between 
the companies which consist of 4 separate agreements.  These amendments need 
to be attached to the court pleadings and approved by the court.  If you have 
any questions, please call me at 713-853-3989.

It has come to my attention that we made need another agreement similar to 
the one that we did with the ANNEX A form to cover the GTC's that Puget is 
bound by when it trades online with us.  I have enclosed the online GTC.  It 
is very similar to Annex A but I think that we need to deal with it 
separately.  Let me know what you think.

and the ISDA needs to be the form that we attached to the drafts that have 
been sent to you given that the drawing conditions match the LC language that 
is in each Master.  Please talk to your credit person about this and let me

Thanks for sending this.  Just 2 questions:

1. In Section 7 of Annex 1 could we please add the recording language?

2. I understand from our folks that most notices are provided over the phone 
and not necessarily followed up in writing and that this is the practice.  
Can we provide for that in Section 13 of the Agreement?

Subject: Re: Cover letter  

I am sending you the Spanish translation of the cover letter that we are 
planning on sendig out to our customers.  Mario Parra send it to me to taylor 
it to this market.  Please review it so that there aren't any problems from 
the legal and image perspectives.  Carol, perhaps makes sense to send it to 
your Mexian Advisors, since they would have concerns regarding the language 
used in the promotion of this products. 

Any questions please let me know. 

Kind regards.

 Thanks for your note and sorry that I haven't called recently.  I have 
joined some day time tennis leagues at our club and between that, Charles, 
Arthur etc.  life has been fairly hectic.  I keep trying to pick a good day 
to come up to the office, but so far have not found a day that works for both 
Bill and I but hopefully I'll see everyone soon.  By the way, you and anyone 
else in the group are always welcome to come out here!!  I know that it is 
far and that you all are busy but feel free to plan something if you want.

How are the legal assistant's and the rest of the group?  How are you doing?  
I must say that I am enjoying my time away from the office.  Charles is doing 
great.  He is now 13 pounds, 6 ounces and allot 23 inches.  He is growing 
like a weed and eats often which keeps me busy round the clock although he 
has started to sleep some more at night.  We are slowly but surely getting 
into a routine with him and I feel blessed to have Bill here to help.  It's 
hard to believe that 2 months has already gone by!  Time flies when you are 
having fun.

Anyway, hang in there and keep me posted.  Say hi to Mike for me and if he 
ever wants to play some tennis, please call us.

Hi Carol:

Enclosed is redlined version of ISDA Schedule and CSA, marked against the
July 7, 1999 version (please note that open items I left as is unless
otherwise indicated).

Also note that the Indemnifiable Tax clause is a head office policy
issue--DB's position is that, in cross-border transactions, the Payee may
not be in a position to learn of a Tax imposed due to a Change in Tax Law
in the Payor's jurisdiction which is based upon the Payee's connection with
the Payor's jurisdiction, no matter how tenuous that connection.  In such a
situation, the Tax would not be an IndemnifiableTax and therefore would not
be grossed-up.  Further, although such a change would be a Tax Event and
therefore the Payee could terminate the Agreement upon learning of the Tax,
the Payee, because of its inability to learn of the tax law change might
not be able to terminate in a  timely manner and would be precluded from
choosing not to enter into the Transaction. The worse-case scenario would
be a Transaction entered into shortly prior to the Change in Tax Law, in
which case the Tax would not be grossed-up because it is not an
Indemnifiable Tax, and the Payee could not terminate the Transaction
because a Tax Event is triggered off of a Change in Tax Law occurring on or
after the Transaction has been entered into.  We think this risk is
reciprocal in cross-border transactions. The Indemnifiable Tax revision
simply shifts this incremental risk from the Payee to Payor.  I can also
provide alternative language whereby we maintain the same gross-up
provisions as in the standard ISDA Master, but extend the "notice" period
to sixty days prior to the date a Transaction is entered into (rather than
on the date in which a Transaction is entered into), thus providing a
window for learning of legislation in other jurisdictions.

On other open issues, I believe you are to check on (i) CEUM, (ii) the
Event of Default, (iii)  Payment Netting, (iv) Securities Act Reps (v)
Transfer language, and (vi) Arbitration. I need to review your comments on
(i) the Guarantee and (ii) your new L/C Agreement.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Regards,

Steve

Keith:
Thanks for your prompt response.  I can respond to some of your comments.

1. In point #1, I was referring to your change in Part 1(b) which changed 
Section 5(a)(vi) from cross default to cross acceleration.  From a credit 
standpoint, we prefer a cross default trigger.

2. I will check with Ed on point #2.

3. With respect to points #5 and 14, because of the difficulty in perfecting 
an interest in cash collateral in Canada (based on advice from our Canadian 
counsel as well as Stikeman's ISDA opinion on this issue), we do not accept 
cash collateral from Canadian counterparties.  With respect to surety bonds, 
there is a statute in New York called the Appleton Law which prohibits a 
surety from issuing a bond to guaranty financial performance.  For this 
reason, we do not accept surety bonds as collateral.

4. With respect to point #7, the answer is yes.

All of the other points need to be discussed.  Can we now schedule a call for 
later this week or next week to walk through the remaining issues?  Please 
let me know some times that work for you and Mike roach.  I am not in the 
office on Mondays.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Carol, thanks for your list. I have inserted some comments/responses on a
preliminary basis in the hope that it will help Encore focus on the issues.
I have not spoken to Mike Roach on the credit issues since receiving your
email.

Subject: Encore Issues List


Keith:
As we discussed, here is Enron's legal/credit issues list on the ISDA:

1.   We cannot agree to cross-acceleration.
[KF: I assume you are referring to "Default under Specified Transaction".
Encore's view (and the view of a majority of its counterparties) is that
where the same parties have both physical and financial transactions
outstanding, a default under one category of transaction is sufficiently
significant that it should trigger a default under the other. There may be
reasons why Enron feels this is inappropriate, and we would appreciate your
comments.]

2.   There is a note that the cross default threshold needs to be
discussed.  Enron's $100 million threshold is based on the threshold that
its banks accept in its credit agreements.
[KF: In the transactions documented in November/December of last year, the
$100 million threshold was accepted as a materiality threshold in relation
to Enron Corp., and a $50 million threshold was accepted for Epcor Utilities
Inc.  I'm not sure why the reduction to $25 million for Epcor was suggested.
More importantly, I understand Mike Roach and Ed Sacks have been discussing
an alternative, which would be a percentage of net tangible assets, and that
Mr. Sacks was going to give that some thought.

3.   We prefer elective termination on bankruptcy.
[KF: Our concern is that creates a risk for the non-insolvent party in
relation to other creditors of the bankrupt party who may have automatic
termination clauses in their agreements. The short-form agreements signed in
late 2000 appear to accept automatic termination.]

4.   We prefer the Loss method.
[KF: Are you opposed to the non-defaulting party having the choice between
Loss and Market Quotation?}

5.   We would like to discuss with you your credit rating test for defining
the "materially weaker" standard in Credit Event Upon Merger as well as the
timing for posting collateral as it appears in this provisions as well as
the Credit Support Annex.  We believe that 7 Business Days is too long for
posting an LC.
[KF: I need to discuss the first point with Mike Roach. With respect to the
second point, we are advised by Epcor's treasury group that the time frame
is necessary, and that is part of the reason we wish to have cash qualify as
Eligible Collateral; if the time frame is required to produce an LC, we
would envision putting up cash within, say, a two Business Day period and
substituting an LC when it is issued.]

6.   We would like to make the GP of Encore a "Specified Entity".  We need
to discuss with you your request to modify the definition of "Specified
Transaction" to include physical transactions.
[KF: I assume this is related to your first point.]

7.   In the MAC Additional Termination Event, we would like to propose a
cure through the posting of collateral.
[KF: Agreed; I assume the value would be an amount determined by the other
party, acting reasonably?]

8.   We would like to discuss your proposed chnages to Section 13(b).
[KF: If Alberta law is to apply, we thought Alberta courts should have
jurisdiction. I understand that both parties have offices and conduct
business in Alberta.]

9.   We need to discuss the arbitration language.
[KF: For background, this language was proposed by Enron and is consistent
with the approach taken in the prior agreements.]

10.  We would like to understand why you want to change the definitions of
Default Rate and Interest rate.
[KF: Again, this was done to "Canadianize" the agreement. References to U.S.
rates when the currency is Canadian dollars didn't seem appropriate.]

11.  Why do you want to exclude Sections 7.3 trough 7.6 of the Commodity
Definitions Supplement?
[KF: I intended only to modify them as set out in the Schedule.]

12.  In the "Recording" section we would like to add the phrase "To the
extent permitted by applicable law" at the beginning of the last sentence.
[KF: Agreed.]

13.  We cannot agree to No Fault Termination.
[KF: This is a significant issue. In the event of a fixed for floating price
swap and a protracted disruption in the Alberta Power Pool price, my
understanding is that Enron would expect the swap to continue with the
floating price being determined hourly by quotes from two reference dealers.
Our view is that creates a significant risk to both parties that the
commercial basis for their agreement will be undermined and that No Fault
Termination is the better approach.]

14.  We cannot accept Surety Bonds as a form of collateral to secure
financial obligations.   Looks like LC's would be the only form of
acceptable collateral.
[KF: Mike Roach advised me about the Surety Bond issue. He also advised that
Enron has concerns about cash qualifying as collateral because of concerns
about perfecting a security interest in cash. Can you outline the concerns?]

15.  We need to discuss the credit threshold language as well as the
rounding amounts.
[KF: I understand that is part of the discussion between Messrs. Sacks and
Roach. I also understand Mr. Sacks is undertaking due diligence concerning
what he perceives to be the "political risk" in the Alberta marketplace, and
that this needs to be completed before the specific credit issues are
addressed. Can you confirm?]

16.  We need to discuss what constitutes an acceptable LC Issuer.
[KF: I expect both parties have LC facilities established and this point in
part involves understanding which banks are involved. If the Epcor
information has not been provided, please let me know and I will arrange to
have it passed on.]

I look forward to hearing from you.

Richard:
In reviewing our ISDA forms we had the following questions for you with 
respect to the arbitration and process agent language:

1. Do any changes need to be made to our arbitration language?  I have 
enclosed what we currently use.  Also, should we keep in waiver of jury trial 
even if arbitration is chosen for situations where the award needs to be 
enforced in court?  Is it necessary to have a statement that the award can be 
enforced in court?

2. We have assumed that there is no need to add our appointment of process 
agent language if our counterparty is either organized in the US or Canada or 
maintains a branch or office in the US or Canada.  Is this a correct 
assumption?  Enclosed is our process agent language.

I look forward to hearing from you.  As we discussed last week, we will 
arrange a time that you can talk generally to our group about arbitration 
issues and questions.

Carol

Enclosed is the Counterparty form that we have come up with for Multi-Product 
Guarantys.  Depending upon the products that need to be covered, each 
Guaranty will need to be modified to make sure that it describes the proper 
entities and products.  I will send along the Enron form of this shortly but 
please pass this along to the appropriate people in the credit group.

Jeff, Stacy and Harry,
Are you going to change the Physical product form of Guaranty to look more 
like this?  Power has changed their form and it may help for us to all be 
consistent especially when we are asked to amend an existing Guaranty to 
include more products.  If you do decide to amend your form, please send the 
new form to credit.

Thanks for everyone's input.

Carol,

My tax department is ok with the forms in Part 3 a i) and ii) of ths
schedule, but ask that 3 a)ii) be changed to "...before December 31st of
each third succeeding year..." (ie, the same as part 3a)i)).

Also they have asked that we obtain the proper mailing address and contact
name for these forms.

Plese let me know if there is a problem with this requested change.

Thank you,

Sandy:
Susan Bailey passed on to me your comments to the ISDA draft and I can
respond
to some but not all of such comments at this point:

1.   With respect to your Canadian securities rep, I am checking with our
counsel in Canada about whether we can use your language instaed of ours.

2.   With respect to the Options rep and the ESP rep in part %, Section
(b),
I
believe that both parties need to make such reps.  The rep in Part 5
(b)(g)(ii)
is to cover the Trade Option exemption and it is different from the ESP rep
below it.

3.   With respect to the language in Part 5, Section (a), this is different
from
the setoff language.    What this is saying is that if a party has
fulfilled
all
of its payment obligations and an Event of Default occurs with respect to
it
(the "Defaulting Party"), the other party cannot withhold any payment that
it
owes to the Defaulting Party.  This is different from the exercise of
setoff
rights.

4.   I would like to discuss with you or your legal representative the
removal
of the arbitration language as it is Enron's policy to have arbitration
apply.

5.   We would prefer to keep the Termination Currency specified in US
Dollars.

6.   Our tax group believes that we need the language in Part 3(a)(i),
(ii).
Why do you want to delete it?

I look forward to hearing from you.

Thank you for suggesting the group that we talked to today.  They all seemed 
to be at the same level and hopefully got something out of what we said 
today.  I mentioned to them that you have all of the latest LC and Guaranty 
forms and that you would be sending those around to them.  I will work on the 
form of confidentiality agreement and send that to you next week.  Before I 
go on maternity leave, I will send down to you a binder with hard copies of 
all of our forms, along with the User's Guides to the ISDA and CSA.  We are 
still putting the finishing touches on the ISDA and CSA Schedules.

Could you also mention/remind the group that now Samantha Boyd's name should 
be added to all credit worksheets and Tana'a name taken off and that all day 
to day matters should be handled through the 2 Susan's and Samantha, as Tana 
is off the day to day stuff and working primarily on special projects?  
Thanks.

The confirms desk has asked us to think about a way that we could shorten the 
confirms that are sent out under Master Agreements by amending each Master to 
include definitions/provisions that are common to all confirms.  Below is 
what I have come up with.  Do you see any problems with this?

Sara and Jason:
Here are my initial thoughts on how we can possibly shorten the weather 
confirms that are done under a Master Agreement.  It seems like we could 
amend the Masters to include the following definitions which seem to be used 
in each conform:

Payment Date
NCDC
NWS
HDD
CDD
The Fallback Reference Weather Station procedures - the confirm would 
identify just the Fallback Reference Weather Station
Data Sources

Let me know what you think.

Carol

Alos, is it necessary to specify bank account information if that is already 
set forth in the Master?

Ed-

Please see attached changes to the LOC Formats proposed by Enron.  I have
revised the draw language and expiration date language to reflect the
changes we agreed to last week.

In addition, I have inserted a paragraph at the end of the LOC form to
reflect a change requested by the bank.  It relates to the ability to
transfer the LOC.  Also attached is the form of transfer statement that the
bank will require if Enron chooses to transfer the LOC to another party.
It looks relatively straight forward and I believe it should be acceptable
to you.

Please review these changes and if acceptable, we can proceed with
execution of the documents.

(See attached file: Enron EEI LOC Format REVISED 052901.doc)

John and Molly:
I have reviewed the ISDA Master that we have with Range Resources and here is 
a summary of the steps that need to be taken assuming that we have already 
notified them that they needed to post collateral: 

1. An Event of Default occurs upon their failure to post collateral within 2 
Business Days after notice of such failure is given to them by us.  

2. Once an Event of Default occurs, then we can elect an early Termination 
Date.  The "Loss: method applies here.  As I mentioned in my voice mail, we 
need to coordinate closely with whoever will be doing the Loss calculation 
(and it should not be Fred or someone in his group) to make sure that they 
have the appropriate back up.  We would send a notice declaring an Early 
Termination Date once the Event of Default had occurred and then subsequently 
provide them with our calculation of the Termination Amount.

As I mentioned in my voice mail message, I need copies of all of the letters 
that we have sent to them along with copies of the confirmations of all

Susan and Samantha:
This is a file that apparently Shari worked on and Susan Flynn gave to me.  I 
have resolved the last tax issue and I will mark up the existing draft which 
then should be ready to sign.  There are some Guaranty issues that I need to 
take care of but in the meantime I will need one of you to revise the draft 
and coordinate getting it signed by the counterparty.

Thanks.  Just a few questions for Carol and Ken:

1. Will there still be a MAC trigger and if so, will it remain at the parent 
level?

2. I am assuming that we still want to receive Holdings" financials.

3. Sounds like what we want AK Steel to say is that  it will remain as the 
only subsidiary of Holdings.  Is that the concept that you want them to 
covenant about in the ISDA?  I would suggest doing it as a covenant so that 
it would lead to an Event of Default if it is violated.  Does anyone have any 
thoughts on this?

Credit said that they will wave the parent guarantee.  The provision will be 
waved if AK Steel states, whether in financial documents or by written 
letter, that every entity within AK Steel Holding is also every entity within 
AK Steel Corp.  I have passed this on my contact in AK Steel's Treasury and 
they are going to get back to me.  I will be on the road tomorrow but you can 
leave me a voicemail with any questions.

Attached is the standard Coastal guaranty form we use for ISDAs.? I 
understand this ISDA is just for these financial instruments and not for the 
physical side of the business.? Please give me your comments, if any.

We will split the guaranty with a Coastal guaranty for Engage US and 
Westcoast for Engage Canada.?? Since the new threshold is $10 million, the 
Coastal guaranty cap is $10 million.?

were made?  Also, please send me a redline (either by fax or e-mail) of both

		 Subject: Kaiser US/UK Setoff w/MG and ENA

Carol,

West power is looking to do a financial swap with Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical 
Corporation ("Kaiser Aluminum") whereby Kaiser Aluminium would buy the swap 
and pay ENA float.  Kaiser Aluminum International Inc. ("Kaiser 
International") has a big market presence in the UK and MG has significant 
forward financial and physical metals positions with Kaiser International 
which I believe are quite out-of-the-money.

Can we find out whether or not we can perform a bilateral, affiliate NETTING 
AGREEMENT between Kaiser International and Kaiser Aluminum with MG and EPMI?  
If the UK is going to continue to do short-term new metals business with 
Kaiser International and if we can get comfortable with metals forward 
positions that are OTM, we would like to use this position and leverage off 
of it for trading liquidity in the states.  Secondly, does the netting need 
to just pertain to global financial business or can it include physical as 
well?

If possible, I'd like to see if you and a UK trading attorney can speak about 
the overall concept and briefly address any UK and domestic law conflicts.  
Please call when you have a opportunity to discuss.  ENA is looking to enter 
into a power swap for June '01.  I'm not sure if this concept is achievable, 
and if it is, in the time frame we're facing.  However, if we can't do a June 
swap, then we'll try for a July swap.

Regards,
Tracy

Nedre:
Per your request, here is what we have decided:

1. Our 2 best candidates were Jackie McCoy and Samantha Boyd.  As I mentioned 
to you, Mark will be talking to HR about making an offer to Samantha Boyd but 
until she formally accepts, we don't want to lose Jackie or say anything to 
her.

2. We have passed on the following candidates:

Stephanie Panus
Patricia Slaughter
Donald Duhon
Debra Vincent


Of this group, we may pass on to other groups that have expressed interest  
to Mark Taylor in hiring for a non-legal position, the resumes of Stephanie 
Panus and Debra Vincent and certainly Jackie McKoy if Samantha accepts.  It 
would be helpful to know from you when these particular  passed over 
candidates have been notified so that we don't cause confusion if we send 
their resume elsewhere.

Also, do you have references for Samantha? 

Please call me if you need any additional information.


Carol

There are a number of factors that determine priority, one of them being 
exposure amounts.  I have asked David to prepare a chart for me before I 
spend alot of time pursuing counterparties and that is what I am waiting 
for.  I would really like to have this information within the next week so 
that before I go on maternity leave I can at least summarize what needs to be 
done.  Can someone else in credit give David the Exposure information so that 
David can finalize the chart with the other information that I have 
requested?  I am afraid that if we wait until you get back, I will be gone.

I will not be in the office next week, although I think we do need to get a 
game plan together to capture the counterparty's that need to be pursued with 
unexecuted confirmations.

Carol, maybe we can talk of the priority of counterparty's

Regarding this project of streamlining weather confirms, Shari asked about 
the new language that we were gong to use to define the procedures for 
determining the Fallback reference Weather Station.  Has that language ever 
been finalized?  This is one of the things that I thought we could pull out 
of the confirms so before we send out any Master Agreement amendments, we 
should try to get this language finalized.

I have reviewed the last Transaction Document List produced by Milbank on
April 7  ( the "TDL" ) and suggest that the documents referenced below will
need to be in pretty close to final shape before we mail the preliminary
offering memo.  Since many of these documents need to be agreed between DLJ
and Enron and then between Enron and the "Equity," we should probably get
started on these documents as soon as possible.  We have seen drafts of some
of these docs, but not most.

Using the TDL as a reference, these documents are items I.1., I.2., I.3.,
I.4., II.A.1.-5. and 7., C.1.1.1-1.4., 1.7, 1.8. and 1.10 and all of C.12.
Thanks, JE.

Can you take a look at the product description that we have drafted in the

Thanks.

components:  the Reliable Power Product Description and the General Terms and

discussing your comments relating to the attached documents.

Shari:

I need your thoughts on 2 things:

We have done another trade with this counterparty on the Omnibus form and 
Jaryd informed me that as part of the first trade, we agreed to some 
modifications to our Annex A.  Do you remember what those modifications 
were?  Also, we are now using our new form of Annex A.  How do you think that 
this counterparty will react to getting a new form?  I loook forward to 
hearing from you.

Carol

Dear Carol,    We do not want to create an agreement specfic coversheet for
each counterparty.  Is there some way to put language in the body of the
letter agreement to address your concerns.  The procedure we are proposing
is intended to supplement current requirements in the ISDA, not replace
them.  If you feel that additional definition needs to be added to the
confirmation process, shouldn't we put that definition in the letter
agreement rather than on the cover sheet?

Our goal is to be able to expedite our response to counterparty confirms.
In order to do this we need to have the same cover sheet in place for each
counterparty.  Please call me at 678-579-3378 so that we may discuss
possible solutions.  Thanks, Lin

needs to remain as it is, because we are using this same sheet for all

Elizabeth and Leslie:
I received a call from UtiliCorp's counsel yesterday and he was asking 
questions about how we would structure an option with respect to power.  He 
was describing an financial  option that could be settled physically and was 
wondering who the counterparty on our side would be.  Would or can we do such 
an option and if so, would ENA or EPMI be the counterparty?

There is a Master Commodity Swap Agreement dated May 1, 1996 between Kaiser 
Aluminum & Chemical Corporation and Metallgesellschaft Ltd. which I thin k is 
now Enron Metals Limited.  Aren't the swaps documented under this Master?

Hello claire- I have spoken to EML's documentation department who confirmed 
that the Kaiser  entity used for  financial trades is  Kaiser Aluminium & 
Chemical Corporation. I can also confirm that there is an  ISDA Master in 
place  between Kaiser and ENA, effective August 28 1997, but there is no ISDA 
Master (signed or in negotiation) with Enron Metals Limited, the financial 
trading arm of Enron Metals. EML trades have been running from 9 Jan 2001 to 
4 May2001.

Hope this helps

Matt Dawson

I think their suggested language is fine.  We are not going to publicly 
discuss their employees' compensation.

Please let me know if I can help any further.

Subject: Organic Confidentiality Agreement

David and Louise:
One of the things that Organic has asked us to keep confidential is "the 
existence of any business discussions, negotiations or agreements between the 
parties as well as any information regarding the skills and compensation of 
employees, contractors or other agents of the disclosing party."  This is a 
departure from our form.  Are we prepared to agree to this?  Also, to the 
extent that parties are insisting on using their form of CA, what do you want 
the approval process to be?

Sue:
Sorry that I didn't get back to you over the weekend but with Arthur's 
baseball schedule and all the running around that we were trying to do, 
things were a bit hectic.  I'm officially brain dead today so I thought that 
I would take a break and write to one of my favorite people.

Things on the baby front are progressing well.  On our last ultrasound we got 
the news taht we were hoping for with respect to the placenta problem and so 
I've got the green light basically to do whatever I want to do although I am 
still taking it easy and swimming alot.  The baby weighed about 4 pounds a 
few weeks ago and everything looked great so I was quite relieved.  Now I'm 
trying to spend what little free time I have getting ready.  the people here 
at work are having a baby shower a week from Friday so hopefully that will 
help since other than some of Arthur's clothes I am starting from scratch.  
Work is going well although I am looking forward to winding down in a few 
weeks.  I'm hoping that I can work up until the very end to maximize my time 
off but we will see how that goes.  I really feel great except for being 
uncomfortable at night and not getting much sleep but i suppose that this is 
good practice for when the baby comes.

Arthur is doing great.  We got him 2 gerbils as a substitute for a larger 
pet!  They're pretty cute, small, clean and so far easy to maintain.  He is 
still heavily into baseball and was just selected for the All-star team which 
we were absolutely thrilled about as was he!  He called dad practically every 
day that he was trying out for the team to give him an update and I'm hoping 
that dad can fly down for the tournament this weekend.  Arthur would  be on 
cloud nine if he came.  We'll see.  Mom and dad offerred to keep Arthur for a 
week over the summer and we are looking into that.  I'm toying with the 
possibility of sending him when the baby is born, but  I'll just have to see 
how it works out.  I would really love for you and mom to come once the baby 
is born.  Do you have any thoughts on that?  You are obvious;y welcome at any 
time, but i sense from mom taht she would prefer to wait until sometime in 
august.  Let me know what you think.

How is Cindy doing?  Do you know what she needs for her new addition?  Do you 
want to get her a joint gift?  Let me know.  I'm happy to do either something 
on my own or jointly with you.  How's Cate?  Give her my best.

What's new with you and your career situation?  I hope that you are enjoying 
what you are doing.  I certainly am and  I am still undecided about what I am 
going to do once that baby is born, although I would really like to take the 
rest of the year off.

I've got to run to my "baby class" tonight.  Take care and I will try to 
catch up with you sometime.  I love you!

Carol

I received a notice in the mail in connection with Columbia Energy Services 
Corporation's sale of its "Mass Markets" business to The New Power Company.  
The purpose of the notice was to inform us that effective July 31, 2000 
Columbia would be assigning its interest in the January 30, 1998 ISDA Master 
Agreement that it has with ENA to New Power as well as all transactions under 
it.  Please call me if you have any questions about this.  I expect that we 
will receive shortly a formal consent agreement.

		 Subject: Mid Market Power Form/ENA Changes

Carol:

I have attempted to incorporate the changes that Jim has incorporated in our 
long form power agreement which ENA has suggested to date into the short 
form.  Attached please find a sample short form (for the Con Ed market) for 
your review.  

Please note the following as you review:

1.  The short forms do not contain the optionality relating to our performing 
billing services -- all of our midmarket  forms anticipate that we will act 
as customer's billing agent and that we will collect all amounts due related 
to T&D and the like from the customer (and reflect same on our invoice) and 
pass those amounts on to the customer's utility.
2.  I did not include a "Setoff" provision in this draft, mainly because the 
vast majority of the time, we will not, nor will an affiliate, have another 
agreement in place with these customers.  If you feel strongly about our 
including a setoff provision, we will do so.
3.  The change in law provision reads a bit differently from the long form -- 
the thinking here is that the long form language is very lengthy and rather 
harsh (and we've had great difficulty selling it in the past).  Taking into 
consideration this class of customer, we decided to include certain items, 
including our inability to cover our costs due to a change in law, rules or 
practices as a "force majeure event" in an effort to soften the approach (see 
the GTCs).  Also we do not address calculation of a termination payment in 
the event of a change in law as the long form does -- again, more in the 
interest of "saving space" than anything else...

Let us know your thoughts on this document and if you are comfortable with 
our using this until such time as the hybrid form is launched.  If you are 
comfortable, we will drive these changes into our other midmarket power forms.

Thanks again for your help with this project,

Marianne

P.S.  Please be sure to copy Sarah Dietrich and Jennifer Hillegonds on your 
response -- they will be taking this project during my "hiatus"  --  I am 
moving to PA on Friday of this week, and will be out of pocket through 
approximately 7/16.  I will start up again in mid-July...

Tanya:
Here is the issue with respect to the Goldman Guaranty.  The new Guarantor is 
now The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (previously it was The Goldman Sachs Group, 
LP).  In the existing Guaranty, we permitted Goldman to assign its rights to 
a Successor Guarantor without our consent if the Successor Guarantor met the 
following qualifications:

1. (a)  if the Successor Guarantor is a corporation, at least 50% of the 
voting stock had to be held by the same entities/persons that owned and 
controlled the previous Guarantor

 (b)  if the Successor Guarantor is a partnership, it had to be controlled by 
the same entities/persons that controlled the previous Guarantor.

2. the Successor Guarantor's Credit Rating could not be lower than the lesser 
of (y) A2/A or (z) the predecessor Guarantor's Credit Rating prior to the 
transfer

3. the Successor Guarantor had to have a total net worth of at least 
$200,000,000

4. the Successor Guarantor had to be the direct or indirect parent of J Aron.


Their lawyer is telling me that now that Goldman is public, it cannot agree 
to item #1.  Are you okay if the criteria is just items 2,3 and 4?

Here is a message that I received from our counsel.  Again, I and they are 
just focusing on the Enron Online issues and Sara is handling the issues 
relating to doing transactions offline between Enron Mexico and the Mexican 
counterparties.  I will suggest to our counsel that we have a call mid next 
week involving you, me and them.  What is your availability on Wednesday?  
Alos, who from credit are you dealing with and are they aware that we 
probably will not be able to in a bankruptcy situation offset amounts owed 
with respect to the online and offline transactions?

 

Jeff:
Are there any tax issues that we need to be concerned about regarding the 
online piece of this?

Can you help me answer this question?  Also, we have been through our ISDA 
forms and had the following questions with respect to Canadian law matters?

1. We have assumed that for all ISDA Masters where Canadian law applies, we 
should not insert our arbitration provision.  Is this correct?

2. With respect to the Trade Option exemption and Eligible Swap Participant 
reps that we normally insert in our form (which I have enclosed below), we 
have assumed that the only time that these reps should not be inserted is 
when the Master is between ECC and a Canadian or Foreign counterparty?  Is 
this correct?  What we are unsure about is whther these reps are needed when 
ECC's counterparty is a US entity.  We look forward to hearing from you.

Great!  The Met has 3 hour free parking - use the "yellow entrance"  to the 
Allen Center (located on the far side of the parking garage, next to all the 
open air parking lots) and follow the signs for Met parking (off to the 
right).  Met is on the 6th floor.  I can meet anytime around lunch - I'll go 
ahead and get court for 11:30, but if you want to meet later, that would be 
fine - just let me know.  Looking forward to playing.

At long last I have had an opportunity to review the Multi-Purpose Form of 
Guaranty you circulated in early June.  I am fine with that form as something 
that we can use and that Credit can send to counterparties.

As an aside, the attached e-mail indicates that you forwarded something 
yesterday.  If so, I did not see that.

I join in Leslie's request to be forwarded a copy of the final form of 
guarantee.  Should you have any questions or comments, please contact me at 
your convenience.

Thanks,

As we discussed, Elizabeth and I are fine with the Cross-Commodity Guarantee

the proper notice recipient in Section 7?  We direct notice to Enron Corp. in 
our standard form.  

After you have received Jeff's (et al.)  feedback, please send me a copy of 
the final form of cross-commodity guarantee so that we can include in our 
form file for all requests.

Thanks,

Keith:
As we discussed, here is Enron's legal/credit issues list on the ISDA:

1. We cannot agree to cross-acceleration.  

2. There is a note that the cross default threshold needs to be discussed.  
Enron's $100 million threshold is based on the threshold that its banks 
accept in its credit agreements.

3. We prefer elective termination on bankruptcy.

4. We prefer the Loss method.

5. We would like to discuss with you your credit rating test for defining the 
"materially weaker" standard in Credit Event Upon Merger as well as the 
timing for posting collateral as it appears in this provisions as well as the 
Credit Support Annex.  We believe that 7 Business Days is too long for 
posting an LC.

6. We would like to make the GP of Encore a "Specified Entity".  We need to 
discuss with you your request to modify the definition of "Specified 
Transaction" to include physical transactions.

7. In the MAC Additional Termination Event, we would like to propose a cure 
through the posting of collateral.

8. We would like to discuss your proposed chnages to Section 13(b).

9. We need to discuss the arbitration language.

10. We would like to understand why you want to change the definitions of 
Default Rate and Interest rate.

11. Why do you want to exclude Sections 7.3 trough 7.6 of the Commodity 
Definitions Supplement?

12. In the "Recording" section we would like to add the phrase "To the extent 
permitted by applicable law" at the beginning of the last sentence.

13. We cannot agree to No Fault Termination.

14. We cannot accept Surety Bonds as a form of collateral to secure financial 
obligations. Looks like LC's would be the only form of acceptable collateral.

15. We need to discuss the credit threshold language as well as the rounding 
amounts.

16. We need to discuss what constitutes an acceptable LC Issuer. 

I look forward to hearing from you.

those issues are and then I will call them.  Could you please advise Joe

clicking requirement in the ETA applies to confirms which it doesn't.  Thanks

Do you want 6/1/01 and forward or do you want to include all of May since 
they have not been settled?  Just let me know and I can send you a new 
attachment.

Does Attachment A to the Select EEI Master need to be updated or is the 
version that you sent to me the current version?

Carol - I think Valerie Mooney (our credit person) and Ed Sacks are still
discussing some minor fine tuning of the LOC format.  I spoke to Bob Bruce
this morning - we're all set on the language in the Schedule to the ISDA,
and there is a minor credit/billing issue in Paragraph 13 related to the
timing of transfer of interest on collateral that Val will discuss with Ed
as well.  As far as the EEI goes, the only remaining issue that I'm aware
of (aside from finalizing the LOC) is whether we've finished coordinating
the Attachment containing the list of prior transactions.  Sounds like we
may actually get these documents executed early next week.

I have given the opinion to Susan to get signed.  We are waiting to receive 
the Texas good standing certificate which we were told may come by tomorrow.  
Susan will send you everything else by fed ex tonight and it is my 
understanding that  we are considering the Master to be effective with our 
opinion to follow.  Thanks for your help on this.  It was a pleasure to work

Mark and Jeff:
Trina and i talked about the issue that you raised with me today.  Our 
preference is to structure the language so that it would only trigger an 
Event of Default under the Swap if the Enron merger caused an Event of 
Default under the Revolver.  At the end of the day, we both felt that this is 
a call that someone on the commercial side should make, such as either Ben 
Glisan or Mike Jakubik.

After reviewing heir form of Guaranty, I would prefer that we use our 
multi-product form.  Their form is more suited to guarantees of debt.  If 
they insist on using our form , I would be happy to mark it up but the 
mark-up would be fairly substantial.  Let me know what you want to do.

I have reviewed the new draft and just have a few nits which I will send 
you.  My only disagreement is with the LC language.  We feel very strongly 
that we need the LC provisions and the form of lc.  The LC provisions are 
between us and you and have nothing to do with the LC bank who will be 
issuing the LC.  They set forth the mechanics for the rights that each party 
has with respect to any LC that is issued for its benefit.  These mechanics 
need to be agreed to ahead of time.  The form of LC ties into these 
mechanics.  Our credit group will work with you when an LC is issued if for 
some reason the language in the LC does not exactly match.  I look forward to 
hearing from you.

Joe, Jeff an Bob:
Here is a summary of those counterparties that have had specific objections 
to our new form of Annex A:

1. Sithe Energy - wants New York law to apply

2. Voest-Alpine Intertrading USA, Inc. - won't agree to the setoff 
language.   Credit should be consulted prior to any further trades to see if 
they are okay with this given our relationships with this entity.

3. Madison Gas & Electric - will not agree to the "or otherwise" language in 
the setoff language.  Again, this is a credit issue.

4. Cargill - wouldn't review the new language because we are close to getting 
a master in place with them.  Sara expects this to happen in the next few 
days.

5. Idacorp Energy Solutions, L.P. -  same as Cargill.  I am working on this 
one and their attorney owes me a response.  This one may take a few weeks.

6. Formosa Plastics - this is the counterparty that sent the threatening 
letter.  It didn't appear from our records that we have traded financial 
derivatives with them recently.

7. General Electric Company - won't accept the chnages and have failed to 
tell me specifically what they object to.  I will continue to follow up with 
their attorney.

8. Basin Exploration, Inc. - same as General Electric.

9. TransMontaigne Product services Inc. - sent letter out on March 30 saying 
they would respond in 30 days and I have never heard back from them.  I will 
follow up with their attorney.

10. Reliant - they didn't accept the new language that we added as clause (z) 
to Section 3(e) and wanted to deal with this differently in the confirmation 
as a trigger that would give us the right to call for collateral.  Credit 
should be alerted.

11. Devon Energy - they had in the past requested more time to review Annex A 
and when I followed up with them last week, they still didn't have a response.

12. Smurfit - Stone Container - same as Devon energy.

13. Public Service Gas & Electric Company - we are close to finalizing an 
ISDA with them.  If we do any trades with them before one is signed they have 
requested chnages in few areas to match what we have agreed to in the iSDA 
negotiations.  I can prepare a mark-up.

I'm happy to come to the office to meet with them.  Next week, the only day 
that is not good is next Tuesday.  I think that we need about 1 hour.  Could 
you please check with Mark Taylor's secretary and then let me know what works 
best for Mark H. and Mark T.? Thanks.

Frank forwarded to em your chnages to the ETA Agreement and here is our 
response:

1. I would like to discuss with you your chnages to Sections 1 and 2 (a).

2. We cannot accept the chnages that were made to section 2(b).  Any 
confidential info that you give us will be subject to the confidentiality 
provisions of the ETA.

3. We cannot accept the first deletion in Section 3(a) and with respect to 
the remaining deletions in Section 3(a) and the deletions in Section 3(d), I 
just want to make sure that we both understand how this will work in the vent 
that you want to trade a product on the website and there is no Master in 
place.

Please call me at your convenience.

Kristina, here are the proposed changes to the Assignment Consent Agreement.  
Our attorney is Carol St. Clair .  Please respond to her (and copy me if via 
email) with your response to the proposed changes.  She indicated that we are 
negotiating an amendment to our master with Morgan in order to accommodate 
this assignment so we will not be executing the Assignment Consent Agreement 
until Enron and Morgan sign the amendment to our Master with them.   We need 
to know from MEGA and Morgan what the transfer effective date is that 
establishes the cutoff date for these trades as between ourselves and each of 
Morgan and MEGA.  She indicated that her revised draft of the Consent makes 
it clearer how this cutoff date works.  Carol's contact information is below.

I spoke with her attorney yesterday and believe that I addressed her concerns 
with the ETA, GTC and Password Application forms.  She is going to add 
language to the Password Application that makes it clear that any GTC is 
considered to be "signed" and "in writing" if they are required by the 
Website to click on it.  Her main concern given the fact that we now have a 
Master in place with them is that they are not asked to accept the terms of a 
GTC and I assured her that so long as she has a Master in place that covers 
the product that she wants to trade that they will not be asked to accept a 
GTC.  Anyway, putting this language in the PA seemed to make her feel 
better.  Once you receive the PA from her why don't you fax it to me  and I 
will let you know if it is acceptable.

Also, as I discussed with Stephanie yesterday, they wanted to do a "test" run 
on the Website to check to make sure that they would not be asked to accept a 
GTC.  I told her that the only way to do this would be to click on a product 
description once they get their password.  I understand that you and Tana 
will coordinate with each other when the time comes to make sure that the 
ISDA Master that they executed gets coded into the Website at the proper time 
so that when they do click on a product description, no GTC appears.

Please call me if you have any questions.

Although I would enjoy speaking with you in person, PRC is occuping alot of

Subject: HR Questions


	

Norma:
My husband and I have the following HR questions that I hope you can help us 
with.  As you may know, I have been out since July 12th on maternity 
leave/extended unpaid leave of absence.  My plan is to return to work on 
January 8th.  Here are my questions:

1. I am considering coming back to work on a part time basis.  From a 
benefits standpoint, is there any difference between a RRH employee (30-39 
hours) versus a RPT employee (20-29 hours)?  In others words, are there any 
benefits that I would lose if I worked part-time?

The difference is in the amount of Flexdollars you would receive, as stated 
below:

 Medical Coverage Semi Monthly 
    Flexdollars
RRH Employee Only  123.22
 Employee/Spouse 146.97
 Employee/Child 137.00
 Employee/family 165.25

RPT Employee Only  82.15
 Employee/Spouse 97.98
 Employee/Child 91.34
 Employee/family 110.17


2. Given the fact that I am not returning until January 8th, am I still 
eligible for any stock option grant program that the company may institute at 
year-end?  
 That is currently under discussion in developing the new Stock Option 
program.  However, they are leaning towards allowing individuals in your 
situation to be apart of the program.
Is there any additional paper-work that I need to submit to keep me 
eligible?   No.
Both my immediate boss, Mark Taylor and our general counsel, Mark Haedicke 
are aware of the fact that I am not returning back to work until January, 
2001.

3. Our bank account has been recently changed.  I pulled down the "Direct 
Deposit Authorization" form and I am assuming that all I need to do is to 
fill it out and send it back to you.  Is that correct?  Yes, please send to 
EB3698
What is your office location?

4. As I get closer to my return date, is there any paperwork that needs to be 
submitted to notify payroll of my return since I am currently not being paid?
 No.  Your time will be change coding from LOA without pay to Active time.

I look forward to hearing from you either by phone or e-mail.  My home phone 
number is 281-890-7122.

I've been working with Jaime Williams and our outside tax advisors to 
determine the Mexican tax consequences applicable to those products that 
Jaime has informed me will be offered to Mexican counterparties through 
EnronOnLine and, potentially, a separate ENA Mexican entity.  I should be 
able to provide the results by Friday or Monday.  Please contact me at ext. 
35777 if you'd like to discuss in the meantime.

Best regards,

As I think you are aware, the Meixco and online group want to implement 
online trading for Mexican counterparties.  Are there any tax issues taht we 
should be aware of?  If we conduct online trades using ENA and telephone 
trades with an Enron Mexican entity, will the exercise of setoff rights 
create any tax issues?   My understanding is that the Enron counterparty will 
be ENA.

Hi Carol:

Enclosed is redlined version of ISDA Schedule and CSA, marked against the
July 7, 1999 version (please note that open items I left as is unless
otherwise indicated).

Also note that the Indemnifiable Tax clause is a head office policy
issue--DB's position is that, in cross-border transactions, the Payee may
not be in a position to learn of a Tax imposed due to a Change in Tax Law
in the Payor's jurisdiction which is based upon the Payee's connection with
the Payor's jurisdiction, no matter how tenuous that connection.  In such a
situation, the Tax would not be an IndemnifiableTax and therefore would not
be grossed-up.  Further, although such a change would be a Tax Event and
therefore the Payee could terminate the Agreement upon learning of the Tax,
the Payee, because of its inability to learn of the tax law change might
not be able to terminate in a  timely manner and would be precluded from
choosing not to enter into the Transaction. The worse-case scenario would
be a Transaction entered into shortly prior to the Change in Tax Law, in
which case the Tax would not be grossed-up because it is not an
Indemnifiable Tax, and the Payee could not terminate the Transaction
because a Tax Event is triggered off of a Change in Tax Law occurring on or
after the Transaction has been entered into.  We think this risk is
reciprocal in cross-border transactions. The Indemnifiable Tax revision
simply shifts this incremental risk from the Payee to Payor.  I can also
provide alternative language whereby we maintain the same gross-up
provisions as in the standard ISDA Master, but extend the "notice" period
to sixty days prior to the date a Transaction is entered into (rather than
on the date in which a Transaction is entered into), thus providing a
window for learning of legislation in other jurisdictions.

On other open issues, I believe you are to check on (i) CEUM, (ii) the
Event of Default, (iii)  Payment Netting, (iv) Securities Act Reps (v)
Transfer language, and (vi) Arbitration. I need to review your comments on
(i) the Guarantee and (ii) your new L/C Agreement.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Regards,

Steve

Subject: Kaiser US/UK Setoff w/MG and ENA

Carol,

West power is looking to do a financial swap with Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical 
Corporation ("Kaiser Aluminum") whereby Kaiser Aluminium would buy the swap 
and pay ENA float.  Kaiser Aluminum International Inc. ("Kaiser 
International") has a big market presence in the UK and MG has significant 
forward financial and physical metals positions with Kaiser International 
which I believe are quite out-of-the-money.

Can we find out whether or not we can perform a bilateral, affiliate NETTING 
AGREEMENT between Kaiser International and Kaiser Aluminum with MG and EPMI?  
If the UK is going to continue to do short-term new metals business with 
Kaiser International and if we can get comfortable with metals forward 
positions that are OTM, we would like to use this position and leverage off 
of it for trading liquidity in the states.  Secondly, does the netting need 
to just pertain to global financial business or can it include physical as 
well?

If possible, I'd like to see if you and a UK trading attorney can speak about 
the overall concept and briefly address any UK and domestic law conflicts.  
Please call when you have a opportunity to discuss.  ENA is looking to enter 
into a power swap for June '01.  I'm not sure if this concept is achievable, 
and if it is, in the time frame we're facing.  However, if we can't do a June 
swap, then we'll try for a July swap.

Regards,
Tracy

I have not been dealing with the confirm desk on this.  The only area that I 
have been working with them on is "unexecuted confirms".

Carol:  Haven't you been speaking with the confirm desk about identifying 
high volume transactions with "masterless" counterparties?  I don't want to 
duplicate work efforts.  Maybe you and I can chat during the time originally 
set aside for Richard (this morning).  Thanks.  Sara

Definitely want to upgrade #1 - its on my list of ISDA upgrades as follows:

Done:  TXU, JAron
In Progress:  El Paso, Occidental, Reliant
To Do:  Morgan Stanley, Dynegy, Statoil, Vitol, Valero, Sempra

Can your dept provide a breakdown of type of executed masters? There are (as 
of today) 423 masters - can we break out which ones are old ECT masters?  
That may give us some insight in to any others that need upgrades.  Also, the 
confirm desk should be able to tell us the level of activity (as they did 
before) to determine priority.  Eventually, we would like to get to all of 
these; however, establishing new documents where we have none (Cargill, 
Mieco, Idacorp, PanCanadian) is my first priority.

Rod should be able to address #3.

Thanks,
Tanya

Subject: Various "Morgan Stanley" master agreements

As a result of Jeff Nogid's request, here is a recap of the Morgan Stanley 
situation:

(1)  Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc.
 This is the entity for commodity trading.
 (i)  ECT has a Master Energy Price Swap Agreement dated 6/16/92
 (ii)  ECTRIC has an ISDA dated 3/2/99, but eff. 8/27/97

(2)  Morgan Stanley Capital Services Inc.
 Jeff Nogid requesting new master for fixed income transactions

(3)  Morgan Stanley International Limited
 This is the entity for equity trading.  Will Nogid or Kinneman ever need 
this one?

Each of these companies has a different lawyer to negotiate the agreement.

Each Morgan Stanley entity might require a separate guaranty.  Anne Clark in 
legal (Cap Services) will let me know.

I will put (2) in place.  Do you want to pursue upgrading (1)(i) or 
addressing (3)?  Please let me know.  Thanks.  Sara

Thanks for the info and I will check with Stacy.  I am planning to return 
sometime around January 8th assuming I can find someone.  I have thoroughly 
enjoyed my time at home and hope that the transition back to work goes 
smoothily.  I'm sure it will take me a few weeks to get back into it after 
being away from it for 6 months.  Charles is doing great as is Arthur.  Look 
forward to seeing you soon.  Would $25 be okay with you for Suzanne's gift?

Hi Carol:

Good to hear from you again.  It is 4th quarter-as-usual around here.  Sorry 
I didn't get back to you earlier about Suzanne, but yes, I am interested in 
chipping in on that.  It's a great idea, and Suzanne should love it!  Let me 
know how much I should contribute.  As for your nanny question, I can't help 
you there.   Have you asked Stacy Dickson if she is using an agency, or 
whether her sister used an agency?  They are much more recently in the market 
for this.  Hope they can help you out - good luck!  I am sure it is not going 
to be easy to come back.  Have you set a date for your return yet?

Mary

someone to commute to our house each day.  If you do know of someone, please 
let me know.  Also,  on Suzanne's gift, looks like so far it's me and Sheila  
contributing.  Are you interested?

Sorry I haven't called or written in quite some time but I'm in my own little 
world here at home.  Things are going very well here.  Charles will be almost 
4 months old and I can't believe how much he has grown.  We finally have 
established a day and night routine for him and I'm happy to report that I'm 
starting to get more sleep which is nice.  I'm still running and playing alot 
of tennis which has helped me keep my sanity.  I have really enjoyed my stay 
at home.  It's nice to be able to watch  your kids grow up and both Arthur 
and Charles I think have really benefitted from us both being home with 
them.  I feel very fortunate.

I would really like to have lunch with you in the next few weeks so that I 
can catch up on what has been going on and begin discussing with you my 
thoughts about returning to work.  It's something that I haven't given too 
much thought to but need to as the end of the year approaches.  Here are some 
good dates for me.

November 13th, 16th, 17th, 21st, 22nd.  Let me know waht works for you.  
Sorry that I haven't brought Charles up to see everyone but with all that we 
have going on here it's hard to find the time to make the trip into down 
town.  Look forward to hearing from you.


Carol

Sandy:
Susan Bailey passed on to me your comments to the ISDA draft and I can 
respond to some but not all of such comments at this point:

1. With respect to your Canadian securities rep, I am checking with our 
counsel in Canada about whether we can use your language instaed of ours.

2. With respect to the Options rep and the ESP rep in part %, Section (b), I 
believe that both parties need to make such reps.  The rep in Part 5 
(b)(g)(ii) is to cover the Trade Option exemption and it is different from 
the ESP rep below it.

3. With respect to the language in Part 5, Section (a), this is different 
from the setoff language.    What this is saying is that if a party has 
fulfilled all of its payment obligations and an Event of Default occurs with 
respect to it (the "Defaulting Party"), the other party cannot withhold any 
payment that it owes to the Defaulting Party.  This is different from the 
exercise of setoff rights.

4. I would like to discuss with you or your legal representative the removal 
of the arbitration language as it is Enron's policy to have arbitration apply.

5. We would prefer to keep the Termination Currency specified in US Dollars.

6. Our tax group believes that we need the language in Part 3(a)(i), (ii).  
Why do you want to delete it?

I look forward to hearing from you.

I need for you to send an e-mail to Michelle Word informing her of the 
following in connection with my leave that you have approved:

1. In addition to the 6 weeks that Enron allows for leave, I am planning on 
adding to that period and using any remaining vacation time that I have for 
2000 which I believe is an additional 10-12 days.

2. After that time is used up, I plan to take an unpaid leave of absence.  
Michelle informs me that I have to specify a date and as you are aware I am 
not sure how long I will take but if I need to specify a date, let's just 
pick until December 31, 2000 and as you and I have discussed, I will keep you 
informed throughout my leave as to what my plans are once I decide.


3. Tentatively, I am planning for July 14th to be my last day but I should 
know more after next Wednesday.


Thanks and let me know if you have any questions.

Hi Carol,

All I need is a note from the Dr. showing the delivery date.  If you are 
planning on taking any additional time, it must be cleared by your supervisor 
prior to you leaving.
I can give you a form to return once the baby is born if you are going to add 
the baby to your insurance.

Let me know if you have any additional questions.

Looks like the 15th works for everyone.  I look forward to seeing you both 
then.  All of the St. Clair's are doing well.  It's hard to believe that 
Charles will soon be 4 months.  Time really does fly by and I am really 
enjoying my stay at home with him.  I look forward to hearing from the both

Thanks for the e-mail.  Things are going very well.  The hospital stay was a 
little long but once we both got home things got much better.  I miss the 
work routine but I'm really enjoying my time with both Charles and Arthur, 
and of course Bill.  I hope to be up and around in a week or so.  my recovery

Alicia and I will get back to you with a mark-up with our thoughts on this 
since some of the langugae appears to be different from what is in the 
Revolver.  Alicia thought that maybe this langugae came from Condor.  My 
objective here is to make sure that there is some good precedent for this 
language and that this deal does not create a new standard.

Why don't you go ahead and send over your CSA form?  I think the idea here

  I have discussed your proposed language with Brant Reves,
our credit person, and
  we are okay with the concept except that we would like for
the ratings trigger
  to be based only on either a drop in the S&P rating or a
failure to have an S&P
  rating.  In addition, Brant has advised me that should we
put in place a CSA,
  that the following would be the credit matrix for collateral
threshold:

  BB to BB+  $2,500,000
  Below BB  Zero

  I look forward to hearing from you.  Should we send you our
form of Credit

 We have developed a form of multi-product counterparty Guaranty that is a 
little different from our old form of counterparty Guaranty.  The main 
difference is the deletion of the 15 day cure period in Section 2.  Can you 
please take a look at this and let me know if you are okay with this as 
something credit can send to counterparties?

We are trying to finalize an ISDA with the above counterparty which is  a 
Bermuda company.  They made 1 tax comment to our Schedule.  Currently, they 
rep to us that Each payment received or to be received by them in connect 
with the Master Agreement will not be effectively connected with its conduct 
of a trade or business in the US.  They want to add the following to this rep:

Each payment to be received by it in connection with the Master Agreement 
will be either foreign source income under the Code or portfolio interest 
within the meaning of Section 881(c) of the Code or gain derived from the 
cash settlement of an option.

Is this okay?  As my days are numbered here if there is any way that I could 
get some feedback on this this week that would be great so that at least I 
can respond to them.  Thanks.

Stephanie and Frank:
Both Susan Bailey and I have spoken with Utilicorp's attorney and here is my 
understanding of where things stand:

1. On Friday, it was my understanding that they submitted their password 
application and that the problem was that the person that they needed to set 
up the sub-user passwords was not in the office.  My understanding is that he 
will be in on Tuesday and that is when they are going to try to set up those 
accounts.  Does that require them to send any paperwork to us?

2. Once the sub-user accounts are set up, then we need to pick a date for the 
Transfer Agreement to become effective.  Since we are changing the date from 
June 16th, this will require someone from Utilicorp to initial the change and 
their attorney wasn't sure when that will happen.  Once the new date is 
picked and initialed, then we can begin trading under Utilicorp's name, but 
nothing should be done until before then.  Either Susan or I will let you 
know when that date is.

Please call me at 33989 if you have any questions.

Mary:
Enclosed is the Counterparty form that we have come up with for Multi-Product 
Guarantys.  Depending upon the products that need to be covered, each 
Guaranty will need to be modified to make sure that it describes the proper 
entities and products.  I will send along the Enron form of this shortly but 
please pass this along to the appropriate people in the credit group.

Jeff, Stacy and Harry,
Are you going to change the Physical product form of Guaranty to look more 
like this?  Power has changed their form and it may help for us to all be 
consistent especially when we are asked to amend an existing Guaranty to 
include more products.  If you do decide to amend your form, please send the 
new form to credit.

Thanks for everyone's input.

		 Subject: Bombardier memo

Carol,

I left you a message last week regarding the enclosed letter.  You asked to 
see a copy...

Background: Enron and Bombardier developed a promotional campaign to help 
sell snowmobiles.  Retail customers who purchased snowmobiles from various 
retail vendors by October 1 were eligible for a $1,000 rebate from Bombardier 
if the subsequent November-March snowfall was less than 1/2 the average of 
the previous 3 years.  In October, Bombardier reported to us the number of 
snowmobile sales in each city covered under our program and paid us a 
predetermined premium for each unit sold.  In return, Enron was liable for 
potential payouts in each of the cities covered under the program (different 
payouts in each city depending on the number of Bombardier units that were 
sold in each city).

The settlement date for the program was June 14 - allowing for true-ups by 
the various weather services.  As of this date, we were responsible for 
payouts in 6 cities.  We sent prompt payment to Bombardier.

Current Issue:  Bombardier has requested that we send a letter to to them, on 
our letterhead, specifying the actual Nov-Mar snowfall amount in each city 
covered under our contract with them.  They plan to forward this letter to 
the stores that sold Bombardier snowmobiles under this program.  The impetus 
for this letter is that some customers in cities where snowfall exceeded the 
strike (no rebate payments due to customers) thought/think that they may be 
entitled to a rebate.

Here is the letter:


Of course, I am waiting for your response before I send this letter out.

Regards,
Gary Taylor

We have financial exposure of 4.2MM to United States Gypsum company which may 
file Ch. 11 due to mounting asbestos claims.  S&P has not taken any action 
since Jan when they lowered ratings to BB-/Negative and removed from Credit 
Watch.  However, USG announced today that it is considering "strategic 
alternatives", one of which is Chapter 11due to increased litigation. I'll

Do you have any thoughts on Point #2?  Do you care if we limit the cross

Credit Support providers and the counterparties?

Carol -

Our legal department is in the process of reviewing the schedule, paragraph
13, and L/C provisions/schedule.  I will send you new drafts once I
incorporate comments from them. Two other things:
1.  Enclosed is a "new" format of Guarantee for your review.  Actually, this
should be similar to the 1995/6 version Enron has already accepted.
2.  I disagree with your changes in C/D threshold discussed below.   We
prefer to limit this to the Credit Support Provider (as per your original
change) as this is who guarantees the ISDA.  I have incorporated your
original comments with little change which you can review when I send the
drafts.

I have sent your responses to Stacy Dickson and Jeff Hodge so that they can 
verify the physical questions.  With respect to question #3, I would alos 
state that until the Master is executed, all of those trades will be governed 
by the online GTC.  Also, to the extent that Cargill traded with Enron Canada 
on a financial basis, those trades would alos be confirmed under the Master 
as it is my understanding taht we do not do separate Masters with the same 
counterparty for ENA and ECC.

Dear Carol,    We do not want to create an agreement specfic coversheet for
each counterparty.  Is there some way to put language in the body of the
letter agreement to address your concerns.  The procedure we are proposing
is intended to supplement current requirements in the ISDA, not replace
them.  If you feel that additional definition needs to be added to the
confirmation process, shouldn't we put that definition in the letter
agreement rather than on the cover sheet?

Our goal is to be able to expedite our response to counterparty confirms.
In order to do this we need to have the same cover sheet in place for each
counterparty.  Please call me at 678-579-3378 so that we may discuss
possible solutions.  Thanks, Lin

Jeff:
Janice and I have been working on a deal with Fred LaGrasta that involves 
entering into a Crude Oil Purchase Agreement.  Their lawyer has come back 
with the following requests which Janice has asked me to run by you:

1. They want to delete the arbitration provision or at the very least delete 
the waiver of the right to recover attorneys fees.  They claim that this 
conflicts with an indemnity clause in the agreement for non-performance which 
allows for recovery of attorneys fees.

2. They want to delete  subsection (e) of the submission to jurisdiction 
clause which contains a waiver of the right to claim immunity from suit, 
execution, attachment or other legal process.

Can we give on these points?  They owe us back payments on financial swaps 
that we have done with them and the purpose of entering into this Purchase 
Agreement is to be able to offset what they owe us under the swaps with what 
we owe them for the crude that we purchase.  It's a long story as to how we 
ended up here but suffice it to say that this is our only hope of getting 
them to recognize the swaps and honor their obligations under the swaps so if 
there is any way taht we can accommodate their requests to get the deal done, 
that would be great.

Rhonda:
Enclosed is a new revised draft of the MEGA Consent marked against the draft 
that they sent to us.  Here is what we have decided to do:

1. As a condition to our execution of this Consent, we will execute an 
amendment to the existing Master with Morgan to (a) insert collateral 
provisions and (b) clean up some of the defined terms in the MEGA confirms.  
I will draft the amendment and Christian will help you and Melissa develop 
the language for the amendment that deals with the confirm clean-up.

2. We need to know from MEGA and Morgan what the transfer effective date is 
that establishes the cutoff date for these trades as between ourselves and 
each of Morgan and MEGA.  My revised draft of the Consent makes it clearer 
how this cutoff date works.

3. We need a contact from Morgan that we can send the form of amendment to.

Call me if you have any questions.

 The memo I've been working on is a summary of Jim Derrick's 10/27/99 memo 
regarding required approvals plus other ENA policies and language re these 
provisions.    THis language is the same as the memo from Lance that you 
mentioned.
 Regarding approvals, since business persons (Detmering, Metts) must make 
them there is much feeling among attorneys I work most with that business 
persons should secure these approvals.

Let me know if you have comments, questions or need anything else.

The confirm that you sent me is a confirm with a different entity called 
Southern Company Energy Marketing, LP which is different from the above 
counterparty and is subject to an ISDA Master.    The company on the updated

We finally got a draft of the CSA from their counsel.  Just a few questions 
for you:

1. Threshold amounts for both of us are $7,500,000.  For some reason, they 
gave themselves a $15,000,000 threshold.

2. I am assuming that we want a MAC trigger that will bring the threshold to 
zero.  Is the MAC trigger for both of us below BBB-?

3. For the issuer of an LC, they have that the rating can be either A- by S&P 
or A3 by Moody's.  Do you want to insist on requiring both ratings?

4. Is our Guaranty cap $15,000,000?

Enclosed is a new revised draft of the MEGA Consent marked against the draft 
that they sent to us.  Here is what we have decided to do:

1. As a condition to our execution of this Consent, we will execute an 
amendment to the existing Master with Morgan to (a) insert collateral 
provisions and (b) clean up some of the defined terms in the MEGA confirms.  
I will draft the amendment and Christian will help you and Melissa develop 
the language for the amendment that deals with the confirm clean-up.

2. We need to know from MEGA and Morgan what the transfer effective date is 
that establishes the cutoff date for these trades as between ourselves and 
each of Morgan and MEGA.  My revised draft of the Consent makes it clearer 
how this cutoff date works.

3. We need a contact from Morgan that we can send the form of amendment to.

Call me if you have any questions.

Enclosed is the Counterparty form that we have come up with for Multi-Product 
Guarantys.  Depending upon the products that need to be covered, each 
Guaranty will need to be modified to make sure that it describes the proper 
entities and products.  I will send along the Enron form of this shortly but 
please pass this along to the appropriate people in the credit group.

Jeff, Stacy and Harry,
Are you going to change the Physical product form of Guaranty to look more 
like this?  Power has changed their form and it may help for us to all be 
consistent especially when we are asked to amend an existing Guaranty to 
include more products.  If you do decide to amend your form, please send the 
new form to credit.

Thanks for everyone's input.

On the last indemnity point, instead of us giving an actual indemnity, I 
think that it would be better just to exclude from their indemnity such

I think that 2 minor chnages need to be made to the Enron Guaranty and 
probably the PSE&G Guaranty:

1. Change in the first paragraph "Enron North America Corp., a Delaware 
corporation to Enron North America Corp., a Delaware corporation and its 
successors and assigns

2. In the definition of "Agreement" include language that would pick up 
amendments, supplements, replacements and restatements thereof so its reads 
:"such ISDA Master Agreement, together with each Confirmation exchanged 
between the parties thereto and together with any and all amendments, 
supplements, replacements and restatements thereof, hereinafter the 
"Agreement")

Let me know if you have a problem with this.

Thanks for your comments.  A new draft should be out shortly that addresses
your comments.  Re the deleted language in 3.4, it is considered essential
that nothing can happen to terminate the Fixed Payment side of the Swap
since this could arguably taint the Floating Payment obligations.  The
investors are very sensative to this concern and I'm not sure we care.  Let
me know if you disagree.

Jeff:
Just a few comments:

1.   In the definition of termination Event, I think that the words "due
to"
need to be put after the word "means" in the first line.

2.   In Section 3.4(a), I noticed that the bracketed langugae "as it
relates to
the Assigned Interest" has now been deleted.  Pursuant to my earlier
comment on
this, what this maens to me is that with respect to the Fixed Payment
piece of
this, we can never terminate the swap based on something that happens to
Pelican
.  Is that the way it is supposed to work?  If so, plaese explain why.

3.   With respect to the lnagugae in Section 3.6(a), instead of saying
in the
first sentence of such Section "the amount determined..." shouldn't it
say "the
fair market value of Party A's remaining payment obligations under the
Transaction".  Section 2(x) of the confirm just refers to Disputed
Matters and
it is not claer to me what is in dispute when an Event of Default or
Termination
Event occurs and what amount Party A has to pay when these events occur.
What
is the priocedure for coming up with this amount?  Does each party
calculate it
and then send it to the experts or do the experts just determine it?

Carol - I think Valerie Mooney (our credit person) and Ed Sacks are still
discussing some minor fine tuning of the LOC format.  I spoke to Bob Bruce
this morning - we're all set on the language in the Schedule to the ISDA,
and there is a minor credit/billing issue in Paragraph 13 related to the
timing of transfer of interest on collateral that Val will discuss with Ed
as well.  As far as the EEI goes, the only remaining issue that I'm aware
of (aside from finalizing the LOC) is whether we've finished coordinating
the Attachment containing the list of prior transactions.  Sounds like we
may actually get these documents executed early next week.

Mark:
I'm looking forward to seeing you on the 21st and getting somewhat caught 
up.  I thought that it might be helpful to you to let you know what I have 
been thinking about in terms of work, although I would ask that you keep this 
confidential until we have had a chance to talk further and make some 
decisions.

First, if I do return to work, it will not be until sometime in January and 
you and I can talk about a date that makes sense.  I think that this is 
consistent with what we had talked about before I left.

Second, I would like for you to give some thought to the idea of me working 
part-time for a period of time.  Bill and I have talked about this alot, and 
I feel that I need some time at the outset to make the transition from what I 
have been doing to going back to work.  We can discuss further what this 
means, but I really feel that it would not be good for me or my family for me 
to start off working full time.

Next, I would like to talk with you about what my responsibilities would be 
in the swap group if I return and have a clearer understanding of the areas 
in which you would want me to work, particularly now that we have more 
people.     I know that alot of chnages have occurred in the last few months 
and I'm hoping that there are specific work areas that I could devote my 
attention to.

Those are my thoughts for now.  As for my office, I really don't care where 
it is or how large it is so just do what you need to do.  I hope that you are 
doing well and I'm really looking forward to seeing you.  I will bring 
pictures of Charles.  He is doing great!  Take care.

 Some of these references are in carveouts where they can only help
us, but in other places they seem problematic.  I think we need to focus on
the definition of Debt and how the references to balance sheets,
particularly the reference to Consolidated balance sheets, may capture
obligations of Principal Subsidiaries we thought we were avoiding?  Do you
have an example of a definition of Debt for use in an Enron cross-default
provision that doesn't reference Principal Ssubsidiaries?

Now that Principal Subs has been taken out of the cross default provision,
is
there any need to refer to Subsidiaries in the definitions of Debt  or

Thanks for the info.  I left a voice mail for Lou Stoler about the need to 
get outside counsel involved and he is going to look into that.  I will send 
you the CA shortly as it is in the process of being prepared.  I also spoke 
with Elizabeth Sager in the power group about assisting in the documentation 
of the derivative and she has agreed to help.  It may be a good idea to 
schedule a meeting with me, Elizabeth, Lou , you and others to walk through 
the derivative piece in more detail so that the power folks can ask you 
questions about it.  My assistant Suzanne Adams has my schedule (37340),  
Elizabeth's assistant is Brenda Whitehead (35438) and Lou's assistant is Dina

Enclosed is some sample surety bond language that we have used along with a 
surety bond form.  I have reviewed your form and think that we can use it 
with some minor modifications. The enclosed provisions will need to be 
modified to fit our situation and taht is part of what I want to discuss at 
our meeting next week so we can all understand how the bond gets issued, what 
it covers and how it gets triggered.   I look forward to seeing you next 
Thursday.

I thought that your drfat letter of intent looked fine.  Just a few 
commments.  In section 6 - Conditions, could you put something in there 
similar to the "Approvals" section in the November 10th letter since possibly 
HSR and FERC approval may be needed?  Alos, in Attachment A, in Section 3 
could you sya something to the effect that if tthere is no master in place 
with Enron and a particular counterparty then Enron needs to be satisfied 
with the terms of the master that is in place between Mrechant and such 
counterparty.

I thought that the Assignment Agreement was very weak and that we need 
something more than that.  Withg respect to the consent, the concept of the 
assigned transaction be goverened by our Master needs to be in there.   
Enclosed is the template that we have used in the Columbia deal.  

Call me if you have any questions.  The only time that I won't be reachable 
today is from 11:30-2.

Carol,

In response to the comments PanCanadian has with out ISDA;

1)  I can live with excluding obligations with Affilates, if it is defined 
this way in the Canadian Master.  Although I would like to know your thoughts 
on this.

2) The Minimum Transfer amount must remain ar $1.00

3) I can agree to the rounding of $100,000 for both counterparty's.

4) I will agree to the L/C Bank to be either a major US or Canadian Bank.

5) I can not remove the current ratio trigger, this company is a marketing 
company with large current assets and liabilities and this is a way to 
monitor the company's balance of receivables to payables.

Please call with questions

Russell

Here are the credit related comments that Pancanadian Energy Services Inc. 
made 

1. They want the definition of Specified Indebtedness to exclude obligations 
with Affiliates.  This is how it is defined in the Canadian Master.

2. They want a Minimum Transfer Amount for each of us of $100,000.

3. They want rounding to be reduced to $100,000 for each of us.

4. In the definition of Letter of Credit, they want the LC Bank to either be 
a major US or Canadian Bank, but not a foreign bank with a US branch office.

5. In the definition of Material Adverse Change, they want to delete the 
Current assets/Current Liabilities ratio trigger.

On the recording language issue, we can agree to the following:  Instead of 
limiting it to trading, marketing and scheduling personnel, we can agree that 
it is limited to all telephone communications that are made to or from each 
party's trading floor. This is because all calls that originate out of our 
trading area are always recorded no matter who picks up on the other line.   
Does that work for you?  I'm still checking on the confirmation/transaction 
tape issue.  Also, our credit person will agree to the Moody's trigger in the 
MAC language that we discussed.

Both Williams and Richardson Products have the typical confirmation process 
language in their ISDA's where we send out the confirms and they have 3 days 
to object.  The Williams Master is governed by NY law and Richardson by Texas 
law so we are safer under the Williams Master if they are not signing.  With 
respect to Morgan Stanley, we are the confirming party.  The Master was 
amended to provide a procedure for them indicating their acceptance of the 
confirm other than by signing it and it involves them sending us a letter 
stating that they approve of the confirm.  I will send copies of the 
amendment and letter to you.

		 Subject: RE: Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corporation - UK and US swaps



Tracy,

Did you have a chance to read my email response earlier this week?  I believe 
that it is highly unlikely that we will be able to net exposures across 
non-defaulting (Enron) entities.  Paul Simons can (and maybe has by now) 
given opinion to this idea.  Historically, I believe the opinion has long 
been that such netting (set-off against affiliates of non-defaulting party) 
in the US should work within the case of contractual default, but outside of 
bankruptcy.  However, in the special case of legal bankruptcy, such netting 
(though contractually agreed by the parties) may be challenged.  Introducing 
the fact that one of Enron's entities is a UK entity may further cloud the 
likelihood.  Clearly, if the relationship involves more than on Kaiser 
entity, netting almost certainly will not work.

Has Diana not responded to your credit exposure questions regarding the form 
of governing confirmation and legal entity?  I believe that she is in the US, 
but should be checking in.  Perhaps you should try calling her?  I think we 
will find that the transacting entity is a subsidiary of Kaiser Aluminum.

Risk management systems for metals are still not ideal.  Volumetric/CVAR type 
analysis may not yield such reliable results.   

Rod

Subject: Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corporation - UK and US swaps
Importance: High

Rod,

Enron North America is looking to enter into power swaps with Kaiser Aluminum 
& Chemical Corporation starting June 2001.  I'm seeing in the credit system 
that MG plc has forward financial metals positions with Kaiser, however I 
need clarification on whether the swaps are done with Kaiser Aluminum & 
Chemical Corporation or Kaiser Aluminum International Inc.  Secondly, is 
there a Master ISDA Agreement governing those swaps?  In pulling the mtm 
monthly breakout, it appears that MG plc is OTM north of $10MM US and the 
liquidation of that portfolio occurs mostly in cal '02.

Given Kaiser's limited credit line, I'd like to look into the potential of 
setting off financial exposures in the UK and US in cases of default.  Kaiser 
is looking at other businesses with Enron and this could be quite fruitful to 
tap into in order to increase trading liquidity going forward.

In summary, we need to answer at minimum the following:
? confirmation of which Kaiser entity is financial transacting with MG plc
? volatility of the metal positions that go out to Jan '04 to ensure how 
quickly this out-of-the-money position can move
? what type of paper is confirming the swaps (whether long-form confirms or 
Master ISDA)
? what credit/legal terms and laws may affect our efforts to establish a 
Netting Agreement for UK and US financial

Can you help me in coordinating a meeting with London legal/credit and 
Portland credit/Houston legal to discuss pertinent issues associated with a 
Netting Agreement between Kaiser (single entity or multiple entities) and 
Enron entities (MG plc and ENA) as soon as possible.  Please let me know your 
thoughts to the above and who we need to contact to get the above points 
addressed.  In Houston legal, Carol St. Clair is available to work on the 
drafting of such a Netting Agreement and is speaking with Sara Shackleton 
about the concept as well.

Please let me know as soon as possible your comments to the above and in 
setting up a conference call to push this forward.

Thanks,
Tracy

We have never gotten comfortable with the Canadian cash collateral issue.  
You may recall that Shari recently looked into this but her situation was 
limited to a particular counterparty.  I was never comfortable with the 
advice that I got from Blake, Cassells and would suggest that we follow up 
with stikeman which is who Shari worked with.  She may have some updated 
memos on this in the file she was working on (I think it was Duke).

Molly and I never talked about this.  Mark needs to pick someone who should 
be in charge.  Molly was never interested in meeting to talk globally about 
this but I think that a meeting with her and Bradford needs to occur.  Take 
care.  Got to go.  Hope to see you in about 2 weeks.

(1)  On a "swap" related note, we have a Canadian party requesting the 
ability to post cash collateral to ENA.  Can you recall where we left off on 
the issue?  I seem to  remember conflicting advice (Peter's insistence upon 
the Stikeman memo and ENA simply not agreeing to accept cash) and uncertainty 
as to how ENA could perfect its interest and what law governs (in cash held 
in a U.S. account).

(2)  On a "credit" related note, I was forwarded the 7/24/00 Margin Exception 
Report (originally sent to your attention).  What were you doing to follow up 
on this report?  Yesterday, Mary gave me a copy of a "collateral letter" 
being sent by Molly Harris.  Did you speak with Mary about working on this 
project in your absence?

Edward Ondarza is moving to EBS.   Stephanie Panus starts on Monday.  That's

Talk to you soon.  Sara

Here is what John wants to do.  He wants to put everything under the 1996 
Master Agreement and is willing to increase their collateral threshold from 
$10,000,000 to $16,000,000.  He also wants to increase our threshold the 
same.  He has alos given is permission to do our form updates.  Could you 
please communicate this to your contact and if they need to speak with 
someone in credit, please give them John's name.  Thanks.

Carol - Can you or one of your folks finalize the LOC format and transfer
addendum?  I'm not sure what you prefer to call the documents, as they will
be attachments to the ISDA and the EEI.

Carol - I think Valerie Mooney (our credit person) and Ed Sacks are still
discussing some minor fine tuning of the LOC format.  I spoke to Bob Bruce
this morning - we're all set on the language in the Schedule to the ISDA,
and there is a minor credit/billing issue in Paragraph 13 related to the
timing of transfer of interest on collateral that Val will discuss with Ed
as well.  As far as the EEI goes, the only remaining issue that I'm aware
of (aside from finalizing the LOC) is whether we've finished coordinating
the Attachment containing the list of prior transactions.  Sounds like we
may actually get these documents executed early next week.

Rod:
Here are their credit issues:

1. In the cross-default language that want to add language that basically 
says that even if a cross-default occurs, unless the Non-Defaulting 
determines in good faith that performance by the Defaulting Party of its 
obligations under the Master is "endangered", then no cross default is 
triggered.

2. In Credit Event Upon Merger we had commented that instaed of the 
"materially weaker" standard we wanted to specify that it meant being rated 
below BBB- by S&P.  Do you feel strongly about this?  Alos, we usually have 
language that says that if an event like merger occurs and the transferee 
provides collateral to the other party in an amount that is satisfactory to 
such party, then a Credit Event Upon Merger is not triggered.  They did not 
want to add this carve-out.  Are you okay with this?

3. They want a separate Event of Default that gets triggered if a MAC (below 
BBB-) occurs.  We requested that it be out in the collateral threshold 
language.

4. They are saying that for "operational" purposes, they cannot agree to 
"netting".

5. They want as a category of Eligible Collateral governmental securities 
with a maturity of less than 1 year, valued at 98%.

6. In the CSA, if a dispute occurs with respect to either the calculation of 
Exposure or the calculation of the value of any colateral in connection with 
a party's request either for the transfer or return of collateral, normally 
the following procedures apply:

a. the disputing party notifies the other party of the nature of the dispute 
by the close of business on the day following the day that the collateral 
request was made.

b. the undisputed amount is transferred to the party making the request

c. the parties attempt to resolve the dispute by the "Resolution Time" and if 
a resolution is not reached, a recalculation of the Exposure is made and 
market quotations have to be obtained.

We normally say that the Resolution Time is 3 Business Days after the dispute 
notice is given.  DB wants to shorten this period to 1 Business Day after the 
dispute notice is given which gives the parties less time to resolve the 
dispute on their own.  What do you think?

7. If a party holds cash as collateral, we normally say that interest earned 
is transferred on the first day of the month.  They want to change first to 
last.

Let me know what you think.  I was hoping that some of these you could 
resolve with your counterpart at DB.

Carol

 As a follow-up to the recent Enron Corp. memorandum forming Enron Wholesale 
Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services 
Legal Department.

 The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the 
legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed 
the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve 
greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

 To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will 
include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor, 
Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron 
Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, Enron Global Assets.

 The organization chart for the EWS Legal Department is attached.  More 
comprehensive organization charts will follow for each group.

Enclosed is the Stratus Ca that we discussed earlier.  Here are the main 
differences between our agreement and theirs:

1. Our term is 1 year.
2. Our agreement resolves disputes by arbitration, although it allows them to 
go to a court to obtain injunctive relief.
3. Our agreement has a much narrower definition of Confidential Information 
4. Our agreement has no "use" restriction
5. Our agreement has different procedures for returning/destroying 
confidential information.


I will have hand delivered to Lucy the CA on ENA letterhead with my initials.

Susan:
I am okay with these changes so long as we make clear to them that by 
agreeing to take out arbitration we are not setting a precedent with them 
with respect to any future agreements (i.e., ISDA Master etc.) that we intend 
to enter into with them.  Please let me see the agreement as I think that if 
we go back to our non-arbitration language, there is other language that 
needs to be added.

I spoke with Mark about the Federal law issue and we both feel that our 
exposure is no greater than what it would be if we traded over the phone with 
this counterparty.  Because they are a federal agency, there is no way around 
this issue other than to not permit them to trade with us online.

Here is a message that I received from our counsel.  Again, I and they are 
just focusing on the Enron Online issues and Sara is handling the issues 
relating to doing transactions offline between Enron Mexico and the Mexican 
counterparties.  I will suggest to our counsel that we have a call mid next 
week involving you, me and them.  What is your availability on Wednesday?  
Alos, who from credit are you dealing with and are they aware that we 
probably will not be able to in a bankruptcy situation offset amounts owed 
with respect to the online and offline transactions?

 

Jeff:
Are there any tax issues that we need to be concerned about regarding the 
online piece of this?

Enclosed is a revised draft of the letter agreement.  Two points for you:

1. They want to roll over to next month the net payment that they will owe us 
for the month of March.  Are you okay with this?

2. They wanted to make it clear that their obligation to deliver barrells to 
us was only an amount equal to the amount that they own or control, even if 
that amount is less than the amount shown on the schedule or oin the Purchase 
Agreement.  In other words, they have no obligation to make up the 
difference.  Asr you okay ith this.  Alos, he told me to delete the "Amoco" 
language since  that lease was no longer part of the deal.

Let me know what you think.

This looked fine to me.  My only comment is that in the definition of 
Floating Price Payer payment Amount instead of the words "a sum" consider 
using the words "an amount".

I have attached a draft for a Prepaid Swap. This deal needs to be structured 
in such a way that the Fixed price is payed once, and the floating price is 
then paid every month. Please let me know if I can use the attached Draft.  


If you have any questions please give me a call (ext. 35700).

Teresa:
As I indicated in my voice mail message I have the following questions about 
the maternity leave policy:

1. I am assuming that any vacation time that I still have left I can use up 
at 100% pay.

2. My understanding is that in order to go beyond the 6 week period I would 
need a letter from my doctor indicating the medical condition that exists and 
justifying sick leave pay at 90%

3. If I want to take after the 6 week period an unpaid leave of absence, 
whose approval do I need?  Does unpaid leave affect any of my current 
benefits (i.e., options that are due to vest, medical, parking etc.)  If I am 
on unpaid leave and Enron offers a stock option program at year end, am I 
still eligible?

I will contact Carmen about the forms that I need to fill out.  Please let me 
know if you are not the right person to answer these questions.  I am 
scheduled to meet with mark haedicke tomorrow afternoon at 2 to go over my 
plans.

2. Their first and second comments to the CSA.

3. Their comment in the CSA about requiring a different standard for holding 
collateral.

4. Their desire to change from Fed Funds Rate to LIBOR  

5. Their renewal notice comment concerning the LC.


Please call me to discuss.  Also, Susan Bailey and I need to talk with you

Our commercial guys are in Philly today meeting with ACE to discuss an 
alternative online structure.  From what I know (which is very little at this 
point), because of the amount of time that it takes to implement the auction 
process online, our guys are looking into with ACE whether this product can 
be offerred pursuant the normal posting procedures that we use for most of 
our financial online derivative transactions.  Leslie and I are scheduled to 
meet with them tomorrow at Noon Houston time so if you are available and we 
can hook you in, let me know, otherwise one of us will catch up with you.  I 
would alos think that we could discuss the revised policy at that time since 
I don't think much will change if we go about it this way.

Hi Stephanie,

Maclaren doesn't have an entity which can act as a process agent in the US.
How about this as a suggestion:

"(c) Process Agent.  For the purpose of section 13(c) of this Agreement:

Process Agent for Party A shall be its legal officer at its address for
notices or, in his or her absence, any other senior officer of Party A at
such address.

Process Agent for Party B shall be its legal officer at its address for
notices or, in his or her absence, any other senior officer of Party B at
such address.

For purposes of this Part 4(b), a "senior officer" shall be any officer of
such party with a title of vice president or higher."

Regards,
Michael

I have asked Maclaren for one in NY, and will get back to you.  Do you have
a Process Agent in Quebec, as it doesn't help Maclaren that yours is in
Washington?

As I understand it, there are no outstanding issues - the credit issues
have
been resolved (I guess you have received this update since you are
preparing
the final drafts).  Once we clear the Process Agent point, the documents
can
be executed.

Regards,

I need to start thinking about hiring a nanny to take care of Charles, our 4 
month old and Arthur, our 9 year old.  We are looking for someone that can 
come to our house during the week as we do not have room for a live-in.  We 
live off of 290 West, about 25 miles from downtown.  We would prefer someone 
that is legal and speaks English, but won't rule out anyone else.  If you 
know of someone that might be interested, please call or e-mail me.  While I 
would prefer not to use an agency, if you know of a good one, please let me 
know. Please pass this message on to anyone else at Enron that you think 
might be able to help.  Thanks.

Mark:
I wanted to let you know that I did meet with Mark Haedicke last week to 
discuss my work situation, and in particular, coming back on a part-time 
basis sometime in January.  I think that he was okay with what I proposed, 
which is to work approx. 30 hours a week on a 4 day week.  I would like your 
input on which day you would prefer I take off, as my initial thought was 
Friday, but I'm open to suggestion on that.  I think that the next step is 
for the 3 of us to meet to discuss what my role in the group will be, and in 
particular, what work areas I will be responsible for.  I will try to set 
something up in the next few weeks.  I alos had lunch with Mary and Sara and 
was encouraged with what I heard from them.  We talked about the possibility 
of having a group offsite meeting in early January to talk about group goals, 
work assignments/areas of responsibility for each attorney etc.  What do you 
think about that idea?  As I mentioned to you at our lunch, I need some 
direction as to what my responsibilities will be when I return to the group 
and given the fact that we have acquired more people and more work areas, it 
seems like some planning and discussion as to who is responsible for what 
work is in order.  Let me know what you think.  Take care.

Sara:
Thanks for your voice mail message.  David Dupre and I have not done all that 
much to date.  He is in the process of compiling information for all 
counterparties (online and offline) who are not signing confirms.  I have 
asked him to group these counterparties according to total outstanding 
exposure so that we can priortize our efforts.  I think that the main issues 
to cover on Friday involve:

1. The effect of not getting signed confirms when we have our standard 
langugae in the confirm or in the ISDA and whether it makes adifference as to 
whether NY or Texas law applies.

2. Possible alternative approaches that we can suggest to counterparties.  
For example, in some cases, a counterparty is sending us a letter attaching a 
list of the deals that they have done with us and stating that they agree 
with the terms of such deals.  I'll have David D. send up a sample.

3. Whether our concerns are greater or lesser when we do trades online.

I'm available anytime to talk about the above.

Carol

talk to you and the group further about this because there are risks

Susan and Susan:
Could one of you send out a notice concerning the following and update lotus 
notes:

1. Oneok Gas Marketing Company has changed its name to Oneok Energy Marketing 
and Trading Company, II ("Oneok II").

2. K N Marketing, L.P. is now known as Oneok Energy Marketing and Trading 
Company, L.P. ("Oneok LP") 

We have Masters with both of these entities.


I have sent to Oneok a Transfer and Termination Agreement where the following 
will occur once it becomes effective:

1. Onoek II will assign all of its trades and its rights under its Master to 
Oneok LP.

2. The Oneok LP Master will be terminated and all trades will be under the 
Oneok II Master.

In summary, once this becomes effective, all trades will be done with Oneok 
LP under the Oneok II Master that was assigned to it.  Credit Support comes 
from the parent Onoek Inc.

Enclosed is a draft of the Agreement.

		 Subject: Re: Cash Collateral In Canada

In the past few weeks, I have discussed this issue with Brent H., Mark T. 
Chris G. and Mary C.  Under the PPSA jurisdictions in Canada, which includes 
Alberta and Ontario among others, cash held on deposit as collateral is not 
clearly categorized as "money" but more likely an "account".  Although 
certain categories of collateral can be perfected by possession, including 
"money", "intangibles", which includes "accounts", cannot be perfected by 
possession.  The issue comes down to whether we will accept the risk that a 
wire transfer to an account designated by us constitutes "money".  Although 
it is not clear, the better view is that "money" means cash in hand and not 
on deposit.  The risk is that an unperfected security interest is subordinate 
to various parties, including a bankruptcy trustee and to subsequently taken 
but properly perfected security interests.  I will admit, however, that this 
seems to be a risk that others in our market take (although likely 
unknowingly).     

Accordingly, to perfect the "account" a registration is likely required at 
the PPR, which is something we do not want to get into. 

Even then, as an "account" is an "intangible" certain conflicts rules for 
perfection by registration need to be considered, as the PPSA jurisdictions 
provide that perfection of an intangible is governed by the laws of the 
jurisdiction where the debtor is located, as determined by the location of 
its principal place of business or chief executive office. i.e.  registration 
may be required in some other jurisdiction entirely.  Further, an advance 
search would have to be done to see if there are competing prior 
registrations.  Also, as the PPR is not a guaranteed title registry, 
registration priority does not necessarily guarantee security priority, and 
law firms will not typically give priority opinions under the PPSA.  

Lastly, if there is an insolvency and the deposit holding institution is also 
a creditor of the counterparty, there may be some argument that the deposit 
holding institution will assert rights of set off over the account.

In terms of updating advice, the statutory provisions have not to my 
knowledge changed.  I suppose there is some possibility that a court has 
recently determined that "money" includes deposits that we are not aware of, 
and I could ask outside counsel to research this issue.

Peter.

Subject: Cash Collateral In Canada

Peter and Greg:
One of our counterparties is questioning why we won't accept cash collateral 
in Canada.  They claim that under the current state of the law, holding cash 
collateral is the method for perfecting.  Please advise.  Should we ask 
Stikeman to update their advice to us on this?

Carol -

Two things:

* First, I will try to email this guaranty to you again, followed with
a fax.  Apparently both failed to go through yesterday.
* Second, I did some research and it turns out that our general
partner is El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas Company, and Cecelia Heilmann is an
officer authorized to sign for both this entity and the L.P..  So if you
want to alter the signature block reflecting this general partner, feel free
to do so.

Please let me know later this morning if you still did not get our Guaranty.

Thanks for sending this.  Just 2 questions:

1. In Section 7 of Annex 1 could we please add the recording language?

2. I understand from our folks that most notices are provided over the phone

Can we provide for that in Section 13 of the Agreement?

well as see Charles of course.  I will be mailing invitations shortly, but 
thought that I would give you some advanced notice.  Don't worry if you can't 
make it as there will be plenty more opportunities to see Charles and of 
course you are always welcome to come out to the house for a visit.  Take 
care and see you soon I hope.

Nick Mooney, Director Weather Derivatives in London confirmed with EEL that 
they were willing to transfer the name to RMS and only asked that all legal 
expenses associated with the transfer be covered by RMS.  The value of the 
services that RMS has agreed to provide to Enron is approximately $100,000.

Thank you all for your help.

ATTORNEY CLIENT  PRIVILEGED.



The assignment looks fine, but I don't understand the underlying 
transaction.  Is EEL transferring this domain name "WEATHER-DESK.COM" without 
any consideration other than using RMS' software program for six months?

Before executing this agreement, you need to secure Mark Palmer's permission 
since the agreement states that no variation of the name may be used.  He is 
the vice president of advertising at Enron Corp.  I have copied him on this.

Mark

Not sure of your exact email address but hopefully one of these is correct.
Can you please confirm that you receive this?

Below is the agreement our attorneys have drafted for the transfer of the
www.weather-desk.com domain name.  Note that they have recommended that a
few of the more specific details regarding the corresponding Enron usage of
the RMS weather model be addressed in a simple but separate license
agreement.   As discussed, in addition to general confidentialiy
provisions, those terms will include (1) the access will not cover any
international weather data that may be added to the system during the term
of use through December 31, as our costs associated with such data are
uncertain and (2) the use of the model will be for Enron internal purposes
only with no data or analysis results to be shared with third parties.

I would appreciate if you can forward this to your legal dept. to review so
that we can hopefully get this resolved quickly.

Thanks/regards

Paul

Bill:
Thanks for the information.  I need to take a closer look at Janet's
language, particularly the "null and void" language to make sure that it
covers all possible events of default under the Master Agreement.  As to
the Texas law issue, our ability to get comfortable from a legal standpoint
will in large part be dictated by this issue.  Is there anyway to get more
certainty on this with the sureties?  I understand that you don't want to
go to them multiple times but this is a key issue for us.  Let me know what
you think.

In my opinion, the wording suggested by Janet Green should be acceptable.
We
will have to have this wording formally approved by the surety companies
prior
to issuance.  I would like to avoid approaching the sureties until all
questions
have been addressed and all changes have been made.  In regards the bonds
being
subject to Texas law, I do not see that as being a problem.  We will
address
that with the sureties along with other potential changes.

In response to previous email, neither Dan nor I know of an attorney that
would
be willing or able to write an opinion in regards the applicability of the
Appleton Law.  As discussed during the meeting, this law has nothing to do
with
the viability of an exisitng surety bond.  If a surety issued a bond that
was
later found to be in violation of Appleton, they would be fined by the
State of
New York.  It does not make the bond invalid.  MJH

What if we said:  "if the
Principal shall promptly and faithfully perform its obligations under the
Confirm, which is a part of and governed by the Master Agreement, then this
obligation shall be null and void"

With respect to her second point, what if we again said "an Event of
Default has occurred under the Confirm, which is a part of and governed by
the Master Agreement"?

I think she is trying to clarify in the language that the bond can be
called for an Event of Default under the Master Agreement, which could have
nothing to do with the Confirm - - - which is factually correct.

Carol:

Thankyou for the attached.  I believe the governing law for each issuing
surety will be the law where the surety is domiciled, but let me do some
checking and confirm this.  Also, will get back to you on your comments Re
the language in our recommended bond form...probably Monday or Tuesday next
week.  Thanks for your continued efforts in this matter.

Bill:
I spoke with our outside counsel yesterday and we have some more follow up
work that we need to do on our side.  One issue that may be of some
importance to us in our analysis is determining what the governing law of
the surety bond will be for each issuer, and more importantly, whether we
can have the bonds governed by Texas law.  Can you answer this for me?

Also, with respect to the form of the bond itself, as we mentioned at the
meeting, the language in the third paragraph which states that "if the
Principal shall promptly and faithfully provide the Firm energy as defined
in the Confirm, hen this obligation shall be null and void," does not work
for us.  Has anyone come up with alternative language?  Finally, with
respect to the Notice of Claim, we would like for the certification to say
something like, "an Event of Default has occurred under the Master
Agreement" rather than tie it to a specific default under the Confirmation.
Does that work for the sureties?

I look forward to hearing from you.

Brant
Per our discussions, here is what the Oneok folks want to do.


1. We currently have 2 Masters - one with KN Marketing LP (now known as Oneok 
Energy Marketing & Trading Company, LP) and one with Oneok Gas Marketing 
Company.  Pursuant to the Guaranty that you just received, both Masters are 
currently guaranteed by Oneok Inc.  In addition, both Masters are currently 
guaranteed by Enron Corp. under a $15,000,000 Guaranty for Onoek Gas and a 
$10, 000,000 Guaranty for KN.

2. The Oneok folks want Oneok Gas Marketing to assign all trades and its 
Master to KN Marketing LP and to terminate the KN Marketing LP Master.  When 
all is said and done, there will be one Master with KN Marketing LP and all 
trading activity will be with this entity.  As I mentioned to you, the Master 
that will remain in place has no Credit Support Annex.  How much should the 
Enron Guaranty be for?


Call me if you have any questions.

Susan,
Could you please prepare an assignment and Termination Agreement for this.  
Brant will let us know if any amendments need to be made to the Oneok Master.

Carol

developed in the last 3 meetings have been incorporated, including the 
bankruptcy matters.  Because there are so many changes, I don't think a 
blackline would be helpful--however, let me know if you want one.   I have

a 1 to 1 1/2 page confirmation is reasonable.  Thanks.   MDS

What are the Guaranty caps?
Is the cross default threshold now for both of us $100,000,000?
Should cross default only apply to the Credit Support Providers or should it

Should we insist on our "affiliate" setoff language?

Thanks for the update.  Based on the marketing information that you received

Carol,

For your review, I've attached the adjustments our legal department is
proposing to the Consent to Assignment since receiving your red-lined
version from Rhonda Denton.  As to the transfer effective date, since we are
now into June, we would expect the transfer date to be as of July 1st.
Please let me know as soon as possible your comments on MEGA's most recent
proposed Consent to Assignment (attached below).

 <<MEGA  Assignment Consent Agreement  Version 2 RED_.doc>>

Thanks,

Thanks.  Per my voice mail messgae, are you okay with giving Cinergy the 
right to terminate?  This apparently is there only issue.  Also, how do you 
want to handle future requests for termination rights if we can't geta 
counterparty to back down from their request?  Do you want me to check with 
you each time?

Questions reference the comments to the ISDA draft should be directed to
Edward Hammond at 414-297-5619.  Ed is the attorney reviewing the ISDA

Please email your Guaranty amendment to me again and I will forward to our
attorney for review.  As I will be on vacation from Friday, July 14 through
Wednesday, July 19, I would like to resolve at least the Guaranty amendment
prior to my departure.

Carol,

I need to fill you in on the new structure. Essentially the senior debt will 
now be Corp guaranteed and on balance sheet. The swap adjustments will 
therefore impact equity only.

We are now projecting financial close as the week of June 19th - the week I 
go on holiday!. That means preliminary offering memo for the guaranteed notes 
going out around the last week of May. By then, everything has to be 
finalised (including the swap).

Hope this helps your planning. 

All is well and will be better when Margaux closes. 

All the best with being a mum again!


     Mark

Can you give me a sense of when you think Margaux will close?  The only 
reason I'm asking is because I will be taking maternity leave at some point 
in time in the next 2-21/2 months and I want to make sure that if necessary, 
I get someone else involved.  Hope all is going well.

At Laird's request, I am forwarding to you a draft if the ISDA and CSA 
Schedules.  We need more information from you concerning our counterparty 
such as exact legal name, type of entity, state/country of incorporation 
etc.  as apparently we could not tell from the financials what type of entity 
it is.  This may require some changes to the enclosed drafts, but nothing 
major.  We look forward to hearing from you after you have had a chance to 
review the enclosed drafts.

Just wanted to give you the heads up that we will need a deemed ISDA done for 
this counterparty.  Jarrod and I are working on the details but could one of 
you undertake to get this drafted by early afternoon tomorrow?  Thanks.

Susan:
We have finally had a chance to internally discuss the comments that you sent 
to Marie Heard on March 21 by e-mail and here is our response:

ISDA Comments

1. Item #1 is fine

2. We will agree to $100,000,00 for both parties

3. It is Enron's Policy to use Loss instead of Market Quotation, which I 
believe is the standard that is currently used in the existing Master.  As a 
compromise, we can agree to Market Quotation for Transactions with a term of 
2 years or less as of the applicable termination date and Loss for all others.

4. Item #4 is fine.

5. Our credit people want to keep MAC where it is as a trigger that reduces 
the collateral threshold to zero.

6. I would like to discuss with you what we are doing with the existing 
Guarantys.

7. Item #7 is okay but we would prefer a separate termination agreement.

8. I need to discuss with you items #8 and 10   

CSA COMMENTS

1. Item #1 is fine

2. We cannot agree to item #2 and would like for it to remain at 20

3. I would like to discuss item #3 with you

Also, some of the changes that were made were not marked (i.e., no fault 
termination was not in our draft, but in yours).  Could you please e-mail me 
your latest versions so that I can make sure that I have seen all of the 
changes?  With respect to no-fault termination, we cannot as a policy matter 
agree to that.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Susan,

The below e-mail/Telex was sent to our Trading desk as MG's Confirmation for 
a Copper Transaction we have traded with them.  Per the desks instructions I 
have not sent our form of Confirmation for several reasons as follows:

1) Trader wrote on ticket that MG was to Confirm the Transactions
2) We were unsure of MG's Legal entity name
3) No contact @ MG

My question for you is are we going to accept this as a form of Confirmation?

Thanks,
Joe

Thanks for your note and glad to hear you are all doing well.  I'd love to 
have lunch - let's do it on the 21st (I'm out of town the earlier dates and 
the 22nd is the day before Thanksgiving).  We do have a lot to catch up on 
(EGFinance changes, new hires for the group, new internal lawyers for the 
group, office space issues) - I haven't wanted to bother you at home but 
things are definitely moving around here - as usual I guess.

Leslie:
Just 2 comments to this:

1. Should we mention their ability to exercise subrogation rights and the 
effect it may have on our counterparties?  This is really not a risk as much 
as it is a relationship issue.

2. With respect to Section 6.1(a), based on last night's conversation, I 
doubt very much that they will remove the reference to counterparties.  They 
really feel that this is a risk taht we should bear given our relationship to 
the counterparties.  Bill is speaking with them about this issue this morning.

		 cc: 
		 Subject: Legal risk factors for Dash

Carol:

Gaurav asked me to summarize all relevant risks associated with the Reliable 
Power Product for the Dash.  Please let me know if you think I should add or 
revise anything:

1.  Section 8.3 indemnity obligation -- We are required to indemnify the 
insurer from any third party claims arising out of the insurer's performance 
under the policy except for a claim by a swap counterparty based upon our 
refusal to pay out on the swap because the insurer denied coverage.  We hope 
to have a one-year limitation on this obligation; however, this limitation 
would be subject to tolling in an insolvency situation.

2.  The insurer is permitted to revoke coverage for up to one year if there 
is a fraud or material misrepresentation or omission by ENA in obtaining 
coverage.  (The current version of the policy also provides for revocation if 
the insurer subsequently discovers fraud on the part of the swap 
counterparty.  However, we intend to eliminate this from the insurance policy 
if possible.)  ENA is not limited to the group of employees administering the 
auction but rather includes the entire organization.  Therefore, we could pay 
out on a swap to a counterparty after the insurer had approved coverage and 
face a situation where the insurer changed its mind and decided to deny 
coverage based on, e.g., a material omission by ENA in failing to provide 
relevant information relating to coverage at the time the claim was 
presented.  Absent counterparty fraud, we would not be able to go back to our 
counterparty and demand reimbursement on the swap.

3.  Credit risk -- The insurer fails to pay out upon the occurrence of an 
Insured Event while we are required to pay out to our swap counterparty in 
the underlying swap.

4.  Loss adjustment credit risk -- If the price we use to pay a counterparty 
under the swap is subsequently corrected by the floating price source, we may 
be require to make a payment to our counterparty under the swap before the 
insurer makes a payment to us for the loss adjustment.  However, if the price 
adjustment results in a refund being owed to us by our counterparty, we may 
have to pay the insurer the amount of the refund before we actually get a 
refund from our counterparty.

5.  Under Section 6.1(b), the insurer can deny coverage based upon any breach 
of our duties under the policy.  For instance, if we fail to comply with the 
notice requirements for presenting a claim, we forego our right to coverage.  
However, we will still be required to pay out on the underlying swap.

Scott and Bruce:
I understand from talking to Jane this morning that we will be able to work 
with you as our counsel on the above transaction that we are working with ACE 
on.  My understanding from our commercial people is that we should be getting 
a redraft of the insurance policy sometime today with ACE which we will need 
your help in reviewing.  Leslie Hansen and I will be working on this from the 
legal end, with Leslie's focus being on the "power" issues and mine on the 
"derivative" issues.  As I mentioned to Scott last week, we will alos need 
your help in making sure that the derivative taht we draft is not construed 
to be insurance.  A draft of the confirmation taht we anticipate using will 
be sent out later this week.

In terms of timing, our goal is to be on-line by June 15th which will require 
us to try to get all documentation finalized as soon as possible.  I will 
keep you posted on any updates to our schedule.  Please feel free to call me 
or Leslie (713-853-6121) with any questions.  If there are others that we 
need to add to our distribution, please let me know.

I am really looking forward to seeing you and Mary next week.  Bill has jury 
duty on Tuesday and I'm assuming that he will not be picked.  I'll let you 
know if we need to reschedule.  I am doing well and so are the boys.  I 
played tennis with Elizabeth Sager yesterday and got caught up a little bit 
on what has been going on but it looks like things have changed alot since my 
departure.  How are things with you, both personally and professionally?  How 
is the group doing?  I'm having lunch with Mark T. the week after next at 
which time I hope to get a better idea of what his plans are for me should I 
return to work next year.  Drop me an e-mail if you can and see you next week.

Sara and Carol,

Attached for your review, please find a draft of a letter to be distributed 
by ENA to Counterparties who are either (i) in Default or (ii) over the 
Collateral Threshold and for which ENA does not desire to call such default 
or demand such collateral.  Should you have any comments, please let me know.

Sue - Russell and I exchanged voicemails yesterday on the status. I reviewed
the revised drafts. I don't think we're at a point to finalize. Russell and
Eqt. Energy's Elmore Patterson have not reached closure on credit
provisions. I think the other changes in the draft are generally ok or need
a little clarification, e.g. I don't see the relevance of adding Part 6(g)
and (h) as we don't trade in pulp or paper. Please let me know if we need to
discuss. Thanks. Henry. (412-553-7711)

Enclosed are clean and marked revised drafts of the Schedules.  As we
discussed,
I have bracketed those sections that are still open.  Please note that since
May, 2000 when the initial draft was sent to you we have updated our forms
and I
have included our new form language in Part 3, Sections (a) and (b), part 6,
Sections (g) and (h), Paragraph 13 (g) and the LC form.  Alos, I have made
the
chnages that you requested to the Enron Guaranty.  Are those chnages also
acceptable for the ERI Guaranty?

I look forward to hearing from you.  I will be leaving to go on maternity
leave
at the end of this week.  In my absence, please contact Susan Bailey at
713-853-4737 who will coordinate with another attorney in our group to get
this
finalized.

and when I asked Sara about Williams, she indicated that she had not spoken

have a call into Morgan.  Finally, I mentioned to Mark Taylor how we were 
trying to prioritize our list and he identified 2 other categories in 
addition to # of unsigned confirms and Exposure amounts.  He thought that it 
was important to only focus on those transactions that were greater than 1 
year in duration from the outset and also to focus on those counterparties 
who have never signed confirms.  Can you add these to your list of categories?

Also, Russel Diamond will be in London over the next two weeks; however, he 
will have someone

By cap, I assume you mean the Guaranty amount or limit - $55MM was agreed
upon.

Susan and Susan:
Could one of you send out a notice concerning the following and update lotus 
notes:

1. Oneok Gas Marketing Company has changed its name to Oneok Energy Marketing 
and Trading Company, II ("Oneok II").

2. K N Marketing, L.P. is now known as Oneok Energy Marketing and Trading 
Company, L.P. ("Oneok LP") 

We have Masters with both of these entities.


I have sent to Oneok a Transfer and Termination Agreement where the following 
will occur once it becomes effective:

1. Onoek II will assign all of its trades and its rights under its Master to 
Oneok LP.

2. The Oneok LP Master will be terminated and all trades will be under the 
Oneok II Master.

In summary, once this becomes effective, all trades will be done with Oneok 
LP under the Oneok II Master that was assigned to it.  Credit Support comes 
from the parent Onoek Inc.

Enclosed is a draft of the Agreement.


Carol

I finally had a chance to talk to ENA's General Counsel about the 
arbitration/courts issue.  We would prefer arbitration and ask that you 
consider whether this is acceptable to P&G.  Thanks.

Carol, pursuant to my second phone message from this afternoon, I am
providing you with the number of an alternative contact in our Contracts
Department:

Angela Weber, Contracts Department
phone:  (816) 527-1293
email:  aweber@utilicorp.com

To recap, the concern is that Board Resolutions are not in the ISDA as
"Documents to be Delivered".  I would propose that both parties provide them
anyway, regardless of whether they are listed in the ISDA, in order to avoid
having to redraft and re-sign the agreement please discuss this with Angela
in my absence.  Please have yourself or Susan give Angela a call to discuss.
Again, my apologies for the "11th hour'' nature of these concerns.

I apologize for leaving you off the list.  Here is the info for the call.  
Look forward to working with you and the group on this.  Leslie Hansen has

may send that to you and the others tomorrow.
