Samuel,

Please set up Kate Symes as a trader with access to all of the West power 
desks.    She is taking over for Carla Hoffman as a Deal Control specialist.
She frequently has to enter California deals (PX,  ISO,  etc) in addition to 
bilateral transaction deal entry.

If you have questions,  please give me a call.

Thanks,
JMF

Netiquette.  What's that?  

Well, in case you didn't know, Netiquette is the proper use of e-mail.  
Because we all spend a large portion of our day communicating with customers, 
vendors and co-workers via e-mail, here are some tips to help you polish your 
e-mail skills and send you on your way to Netiquette success. 

Short & Sweet
Keep your messages concise and to the point.

Cluless In . . .
The subject line can be a couple of words or a short phrase that gives the 
reader a hint to the contents of your message.

ARE YOU ANGRY?
The use of UPPERCASE text is the equivalent of yelling in the world of 
e-mail.  Lower the case and, thus, your e-mail voice.

Are You Still Angry!!!??
Watch out for excessive punctuation like exclamation points.  If something is 
important, put it in words, not exclamation points.

We Can Become Too Attached
Think of your reader and, whenever possible, put your message in the body of 
the e-mail rather than in an attachment.

Does Everyone Need To Know?
Be careful when you send replies to "all recipients" of an e-mail.  Ask 
yourself if everyone really needs to see your response.  If not, you'll be 
using up disk space, cluttering inboxes and slowing the mail servers 
unnecessarily.

Spellcheck Is Your Friend
Like printed documents, e-mail deserves a review to assure that grammar and 
spelling are correct.

Privacy On The Net?
There is no such thing as private e-mail.  Never send anything by e-mail that 
you would not want to see on the front page of tomorrow's newspaper.  There 
are no security guarantees with electronic mail.

Eyes Only In Cyberspace
Avoid sending any confidential or sensitive information via e-mail.  
Remember, it's very easy for someone else to forward messages you considered 
confidential.  Even messages sent as "Confidential" can be copied.

Quick Tips -- Refine Your Skills
Long paragraphs are hard to read.  Break them up into smaller ones of two to 
three sentences.
The use of abbreviations should be minimal.
When sending e-mail outside Enron, keep it plain and simple.  That means no 
elaborate use of formatting tools, such as bold, indent, etc.
Your e-mail signature should be the same one you use on printed documents.
Address people in business e-mail the same way you normally would in person 
or in a letter (e.g., Bob: or Ms. Smith:)
Sarcasm is dangerous to use in e-mail.  Remember, e-mail does not convey 
emotions.

As noted on the email I sent to you on November 16 on the subject of PRC 
Deadlines and Meetings, I wanted to remind you that your Goals for 2001 
document is due to your manager by Monday, December 11.  

The goals should be a mixture of short-term and long-term goals.  For 
example, a short-term goal could be to learn more about the functionality of 
Enpower, while a long-term goal could be to move to the European office to 
manage logistics.  It is important for management to know employee goals so 
that management can help the employee get to where they want to go.

If you have any questions, ask your manager or me.

**Clarification**

Harassment Prevention Training

This training is mandatory for all Enron employees employed since the last 
seminar was conducted  in late 1998 or early 1999.  Those who have already 
attended Enron harassment avoidance training will be offered a refresher 
course in avoiding and preventing harassment.

To contribute our personal best at ENRON, our conduct must promote respectful 
and co-operative work relationships. Workplace harassment conflicts with 
ENRON's vision and values and violates Company policy.  Harassment also can 
violate federal and state laws.  By understanding what harassment is and its 
potential harm, we can prevent it in our workplace.

During this training you will:

 Be able to recognize harassment
 Learn to take precautions against being harassed
 Learn to avoid being considered a harasser
 Know how to address a situation involving harassment
 Learn how harassment prevention is consistent with ENRON values

Please click here (  )  to sign up for the session of your choice.    If you 
have problems registering or have any questions, please call 713 853-0357.

We are pleased to announce that all employees of EWS and EES will receive 
harassment prevention training.  

The dates and times available for the sessions are:


 Friday, Feb 23; 1:00 - 2:30; 2:45 - 4:15
  Monday Mar 5; 1:00 - 2:30; 2:45 - 4:15; 4:30 - 6:00

All training sessions will be held in the LaSalle Room at the DoubleTree 
Hotel.
There is a $50 charge for each attendee in the training session.

Hello, I left a message for David Dupre and he has not called me back.  If 
you want to have Matt call Tim Cannon at Sempra that would be fine.  His 
phone number is (203) 355-5190.  I don't know why this has been so 
difficult.  If I hear from David I will let you know.  I want to know how he 
handled these deals in the past.

Thanks,
Melissa

Just curious - did you ever catch up with Larry Joe Hunter regarding the Long 
Term Southwest desk's futures deal with Sempra? I'm wondering if I should 
grab Matt Motley before he goes home today to let him know he needs to get a 
hold of Tim Cannon about the ADT. Let me know when and if you talk to him.

Thanks,
Kate

We are going to start using a single application to wait for PX prices in the 
morning (get funky) and to upload specific prices manually.  Whereas in the 
past we used an application called PX_Live and an application called 
PX_Capture, we will now use just one application called PX_Capture.

You can get to this application from the Portland menu (Start > Programs > 
Portland > Scheduling > PX_Capture.exe).  The PX_Live choice will go away 
from your menu choice.

Dave -
I'm the new Deal Control staff person here in the Portland office, and I've 
been told you're the person to contact regarding counterparty match-ups for 
our futures deals this month.

The futures were done today, and if you could let me know of the 
corresponding counterparties as soon as you find out, that would be very 
helpful. If there is anything I should know about your job or how we might 
help each other work better, please let me know.

Thanks a lot,
Kate

Good Morning,

Over the last couple of weeks, we've made several recent additions to the 
Portland IT applications team.  We hope that with this new influx of talent 
we will continue to "raise the bar" for IT support of Enron's trading 
activities in Portland.

Richard Schweiger is our new Senior Applications Specialist. He comes to 
Enron through RHI Consulting where he contracted at Enron for the last 2 
months and has now converted to full-time.  Richard has several years of 
Visual Basic and C++ programming experience. He has been living in the 
Portland, Oregon area for the past 4 years and is originally from 
California.  His current projects include migration of the California 
Pre-Trade application to the intranet as well as building strong middle tier 
architecture to support the new CAL-Web development.

Michael Tully is our new lead Trading Floor Support analyst.  He recently 
moved from Oklahoma where he was the Lead Help Desk Support for Electronic 
Storage Corporation.  Mike's wife is due with their second baby in January.  
Outside of work, Mike love's to scuba dive.  Mike is currently working for 
Comsys and hopes to eventually convert to full-time.  Mike is replacing 
Wendella Rhoads who recently moved back to Eugene to be closer to family.

Dan Maxwell is a new contract developer from Maxim consulting working on the 
California Pre-Trading application.  Dan currently lives in Boise, Idaho and 
commutes to Portland during the week.  Dan spent the previous year commuting 
to Washington DC developing software for GEICO insurance company.  He is 
originally from Miami, Florida where the beach is the place to be but 
counting is a lost art.  

Paul Kane has recently transferred from the IT infrastructure group to the IT 
applications group to work on SQL support and development.
 
On a sadder note, we will be losing Winston Goodbody on December 18th to a 
six month cross-country skiing trek across Wyoming.  Winston has been 
contracting at Enron for the last year and a half and will be sorely missed.

Thanks,  David Poston

System March 1, 2001.

XMS will replace the Excel Spreadsheet currently submitted to request expense 
reimbursement. PLEASE NOTE: Those people/teams who have not received training 
are still able to submit reports as before, but teams within ENA are asked to 
transition to XMS as soon as possible following the March 1 target. The 
deadline to transition to XMS is April 1, 2001.

There may be a number of ENA administrative assistants who have already 
received hands-on classroom training and are able to submit both their own 
reports and the reports of those people they support.

If you or your administrative assistant need to be trained on XMS, there are 
several options available:

1. XMS Demo
One or more XMS demonstrations had been scheduled in the month of February. 
These demonstrations will give an overview of XMS functionality but will not 
offer hands-on training. 

2. XMS Classroom Training

California=01,s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last seve=
ral=20
months.  Unfortunately, this debate has generated more heat than light.  We=
=20
want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.=
 =20
Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation=
=20
and our position on California energy issues.

What happened in California

The source of California=01,s current problem is as straightforward as supp=
ly=20
and demand.  California=01,s economy grew 29 percent since 1998.  This incr=
eased=20
the demand for electricity by 24 percent.  At the same time, regulatory=20
restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state.  So=
=20
demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added.  The resul=
t,=20
predictably, is a shortage.  This summer, peak capacity will be about 10=20
percent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state.

In addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related=
=20
factors that led to the current crisis.  First, the state=01,s regulations=
=20
forced all sales and purchases into the spot market.  The spot market for=
=20
power is extraordinarily volatile.  The way firms behave in a free market=
=20
when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo=
ng=20
term, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.  I=
n=20
California, state regulation prevented this strategy.  This would be the=20
equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th=
e=20
most volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine=20
while the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawat=
t=20
was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price.

Second, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remain=
ed=20
in effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep=20
competition out.  This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa=
le=20
prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the=20
regulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt.

In short, California=01,s problems were caused by regulation, not deregulat=
ion. =20
Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new=
=20
generation from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile=
=20
spot prices.

At the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned=
=20
the state=01,s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, w=
hich,=20
if adopted, would have averted the current crisis.

Enron=01,s Role

Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f=
ix=20
the problem.  Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the=20
politicians and the media.  Here are the facts:

? Other than a small amount of wind power, Enron is not a generator in the=
=20
state of California.  Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the=
=20
same market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a=20
market maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.  We ar=
e=20
interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc=
ts=20
for our customers.
? As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from=
=20
the problems the states=01, utilities, and their customers, now face.  We=
=20
protected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility.

You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply=20
power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on=

the open market.  Early reports mischaracterized this as a =01&turnback=018=
 of our=20
customers to the utilities.  Here are the facts:

? As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California=20
market, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct=
ly=20
from the utilities.  This decision reduced EES=01,s market price risk by=20
allowing EES to access lower utility rates.
? EES did not terminate any customer contracts, and our customers continue =

receive the financial benefits of their contract prices.
? EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them=
=20
with other energy-related products and services, including assistance in=20
reducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times.

Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its=
=20
crisis; Enron continues to sign up customers in the state; and Enron=20
continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western=
=20
power markets.  Enron=01,s primary business is managing risk for our custom=
ers=20
with solutions customized to meet their needs.  There has never been more=
=20
demand for our products and services.

The Solution

The solution to California=01,s crisis is also straightforward.  In summary=
, the=20
state must increase supply, reduce demand, reduce reliance on the spot mark=
et=20
and shore up the financial stability of the state=01,s utilities.

Increasing Supply

California=01,s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing=
=20
short of Byzantine.  Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les=
s=20
than a year.  In California, it often takes 5 to 7 years.  California simpl=
y=20
must streamline this process.  Ironically, while many of the regulations=20
generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality, the=
=20
regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and=20
displacing current plants, which emit 40 times as much NOx.  California can=
=20
have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new=20
facilities.

Reducing Demand

Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand. =
=20
They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is.  An open retail=
=20
market would trigger demand responses, which would balance supply and deman=
d=20
at lower prices than today.  California should fully open its retail market=
.

Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market

In a truly deregulated market, customers would protect themselves from=20
volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer=
=20
term, fixed-price basis.  The state has instead left procurement in the han=
ds=20
of the utilities, which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market=
. =20
Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the=
ir=20
price risk.

Restoring the Financial Integrity of the State=01,s Institutions

The utilities in California are not paying their bills.  This has led to=20
greater uncertainty in the market, higher costs, and reduced flexibility to=
=20
arrive at lasting solutions.  California must permit its utilities to recov=
er=20
their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and=
=20
distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is=
=20
needed.

Just as important as doing these things, the state must avoid policies that=
,=20
while politically attractive, do not fix the problem or even make matters=
=20
worse.  Price caps have been proposed.  They don=01,t work; have never work=
ed;=20
and they will not work here.  Price caps succeed only in creating shortages=
,=20
which then have to be allocated among competing users.  Imagine how=20
ineffectively the government would be in determining, for example, whether =
it=20
is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall=
ey=20
or Silicon Valley.  Price caps are a surefire way to make the current=20
shortage worse.

The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in=20
California.  There is no reason to believe, and every reason to doubt, that=
=20
the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in,=20
constructing, operating and maintaining assets.  This will also result in=
=20
California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power=20
generation -- which the private sector can do -- instead of education, road=
s=20
and other public goods -- which the private sector cannot do.

As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t=
he=20
crisis from the media, it=01,s important for you to know this:  We at Enron=
 will=20
continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real=20
solutions to the state.

IMPORTANT EPMI POLICY REGARDING HARD COPY DOCUMENTS
WHILE LITIGATION IS PENDING

This policy is in addition to my prior email about the procedure for
handling email and electronic documents.  While most of what we do is
contained within Enron's electronic systems, there still are times when hard
copies are made or needed for running our business.  Here is how you must
handle those hard copy documents:

1. The basic rule is that if you have hard copies of documents that are
used in EPMI's business of selling energy in the WSCC, you must keep those
documents until further notice.  If space becomes a problem, please contact
Debra Davidson who can arrange for storage.

2. What constitutes a document?  In some instances you will have one
copy of a document that has your handwritten notes on it, and another copy
that may be clean.  For these purposes both are considered documents and
both must be saved.  Similarly, if several people have copies of the same
document, each separate copy is considered a separate document.  On the
other hand, if you made 10 copies for a meeting and there were 4 left over
that were never handed out or were not used, those may be recycled so long
as you keep the ones that were used.   If you keep handwritten notes for
your work, those would be considered documents as well.  Telephone notes,
charts, printouts of data, spreadsheets etc. all constitute documents.   If
you have a question about what constitutes a document and whether it should
be saved, please ask Christian Yoder and Steve Hall.

3. The goal and purpose of this policy is to make sure that no hard
copies of documents are discarded that are relevant to the wholesale
electricity market litigation.  If hard copy documents are discarded, at a
later point in time EPMI and/or its employees will be criticized for failing
to preserve documents relevant to the wholesale electricity litigation.

4. Personal documents such as shopping lists, personal messages from
friends unrelated to the energy business etc. are not covered by this policy
and you may do with them as you wish.

 As a follow-up to the recent Enron Corp. memorandum forming Enron Wholesale 
Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services 
Legal Department.

 The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the 
legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed 
the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve 
greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

 To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will 
include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor, 
Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron 
Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, Enron Global Assets.

 The organization chart for the EWS Legal Department is attached.  More 
comprehensive organization charts will follow for each group.

Thanks to all of you, Enron North America has had an outstanding year in=20
2000.  Some of the more notable accomplishments include:
a) 100% plus increase in EBIT from 1999 actuals to 2000 forecast;
b) significant rationalization of the balance sheet including the sale of t=
he=20
(i) Wind River/Powder River gathering assets, (ii) East Coast Power=20
generating assets, (iii) HPL and (iv) five of the six Eastern Peakers;
c) ENA is the leading energy merchant by a factor of two;
d) physical electricity volume grew by 34% YTD 1999 to YTD 2000 forecast;
e) natural gas volumes grew by 82% YTD 1999 to YTD 2000 forecast;
f) 500% growth in daily transactions from November 1999 to November 2000 du=
e=20
to the highly successful Enron OnLine distribution channel; and
g) ENA reaching its 25% ROCE target.

These are truly outstanding accomplishments and our expectations for growth=
=20
and opportunity in Enron North America for 2001 are consistent with that=20
success.  In order to reach these goals, we felt it necessary to re-align a=
=20
number of our organizations. A number of these changes are completed.  The=
=20
goals of such re-alignment include:
a) increase overall productivity with the goal to ensure that every employe=
e=20
is in a position to contribute regardless of skill set;
b) increase overall market coverage, deal flow and information generation=
=20
with the goal to increase bid/offer income, increase the velocity of deal=
=20
flow, improve customer coverage and promote quality information transfer to=
=20
our trading organization;
c) increase deal quality and earnings quality with the goal to (i) allocate=
=20
our resources towards the best transactions and (ii) significantly increase=
=20
our =01&mid-market=018 originated transactions in our portfolio;
d) promote real time decision making and a closer tie between our trading a=
nd=20
origination (mid-market and structured) organizations in order to better=20
align those functions to reduce the amount of un-productive internal focus;
e) increase the overall velocity of the capital being utilized consistent=
=20
with our goal of a 25% plus return on capital employed; and
f) identify and recognize a host of new leaders in the organization that ar=
e=20
critical to meeting our goals next year.

With these objectives in mind, patterned after the successful business mode=
ls=20
in Calgary and Portland, effective immediately the following changes are=20
being implemented:
a) East Power =01) a single East Power Team incorporating trading, mid-mark=
et=20
and origination will be formed under the co-leadership of Kevin Presto and=
=20
Janet Dietrich who will report to the Enron Americas - Office of the Chairm=
an=20
(EA OOC).  This team will have one income statement, one book and a joint=
=20
accountability. However, a clear delineation of responsibilities inside the=
se=20
teams will continue to exist in which the trading organization will manage=
=20
the risk, income statement and product development aspects of the=20
partnership. The originators will have the primary responsibility to genera=
te=20
origination income, provide coverage, deal flow, lead strategy formulation,=
=20
provide information and generate strategic positions.  Overall, the team wi=
ll=20
be rewarded based upon increasing the value of the book, meeting=20
coverage/deal flow targets and meeting its strategic/growth goals in the=20
Eastern power markets. The team will be responsible for covering the IOU=01=
,s,=20
muni=01,s/co-ops, industrials and IPP=01,s and will utilize all ENA=01,s pr=
oduct=20
capabilities including the power commodity, assets and capital. The team wi=

further be broken down into several key strategic regions and business unit=
s=20
including:=20
  (i) ERCOT =01) managed by Doug Gilbert Smith and Bruce Sukaly;
  (ii) NE =01) managed by Dana Davis and Jeff Ader;
  (iii) Midwest =01) managed by Fletch Sturm and Ed Baughman;
  (iv) SE =01) managed by Rogers Herndon and Ozzie Pagan;
  (v) East Power Development =01) managed by Ben Jacoby;
  (vi) East Power Structuring  - managed by Bernie Aucoin; and
  (vii) East Power Fundamentals and the =01&Genco=018 =01) managed by Lloyd=
 Will
  =20
b) West Power =01) there will be no changes to the Portland office which is=
=20
managed by Tim Belden and Chris Calger .  Both Tim and Chris will continue =
to=20
report to the EA OOC.
c) Canada and Mexico =01) there will be no changes to the Canadian or Mexic=
an=20
offices which are managed by Rob Milnthorp and Max Yzaguirre respectively. =
=20
Both Rob and Max will continue to report to the EA OOC.
d) U.S. Natural Gas =01) there are several changes anticipated in this busi=
ness=20
consistent with the goals and objectives described above. The changes=20
primarily affect the East, Central, West and Texas gas regions. Each region=
=20
will consist of a single gas team incorporating trading, mid-market and=20
origination. Each team will have one income statement, one book and a joint=
=20
accountability. However, a clear delineation of responsibilities inside the=
se=20
teams will continue to exist in which the trading organization will manage=

the risk, income statement and product development aspects of the=20
partnership. The originators will have the primary responsibility to genera=

origination income, provide coverage, deal flow, lead strategy formulation,=

provide information and generate strategic positions. Overall, the team wil=
l=20
be rewarded based upon increasing the value of the book, meeting=20
coverage/deal flow targets and meeting its strategic/growth goals in the=20
Eastern, Western, Central and Texas gas markets.  The team will be=20
responsible for covering the LDC=01,s, muni=01,s/co-ops, industrials, IOU=
=01,s, IPP=01,s=20
and the producers.  There will be an increasing focus on the upstream side =
of=20
the business including the producers, transporters and storage providers in=
=20
addition to market area opportunities. The team will utilize all of ENA=01,=
s=20
product capabilities including the gas commodity, assets and capital. Each =
of=20
these groups will report directly to the EA OOC;
East Gas =01) a single East Gas Team incorporating trading, mid-market and=
=20
origination will be formed under the co-leadership of Scott Neal and Frank=
=20
Vickers who will be returning from Portland to join this team. =20
West Gas  =01) in a similar manner, a West Gas Team will be formed co-manag=
ed by=20
Phillip Allen and Barry Tycholiz, who will be joining us in Houston from th=
e=20
Canadian team. The Denver office under Mark Whitt will be integrated under=
=20
this team.
Central Gas =01)  in a similar manner, a Central Gas Team will be formed=20
co-managed by Hunter Shively and Laura Luce. The Chicago office will be=20
integrated into this team.
Texas Gas =01) the Texas Gas Team will be managed by Tom Martin. This team =
will=20
continue to manage the gas trading business around HPL until the pending sa=
le=20
is concluded in Q2 2001.  After the sale of HPL, this team will build a Tex=
as=20
gas business without ownership of the HPL assets. =20
Financial =01) this group will continue to be managed by John Arnold with n=
o=20
significant changes.
Derivatives =01) this group, lead by Fred Lagrasta, will offer derivative a=
nd=20
financial mid-market products and services to the natural gas market=20
specifically targeting CFO=01,s and treasury departments.  Fred will contin=
ue to=20
maintain certain existing mid-market accounts with a number of producer and=
=20
industrial accounts where relationships are well formed. Otherwise,=20
mid-market coverage will gravitate to the regions. The New York office gas=
=20
marketing efforts will continue to be managed by Fred.
Upstream Products =01) this group, lead by Jean Mrha, will develop several=
=20
distinct product offerings for the upstream segment of the gas market.  Thi=
s=20
group will develop and market the product in conjunction with the regions.=
=20
This is consistent with our desire to have a broader product offering and=
=20
greater market penetration in the upstream segment.  These products include=
=20
producer outsourcing, similar to our successful Petro-Canada and Suncor=20
relationships in Canada, physical storage re-engineering, compressor=20
services, wellhead liquidity products and offshore asset and capital=20
products.  In addition, Jean will manage our Bridgeline joint venture with=
=20
Texaco. =20
Gas Structuring =01) this group will be lead by Ed McMichael, reporting to =
Frank=20
Vickers, will provide structuring and deal support to all the gas teams.
Gas Fundamentals =01) this group will be lead by Chris Gaskill, reporting t=
o=20
Hunter Shively, will provide fundamentals to all the gas teams.   =20

Julie Gomez will continue to support the gas floor through several identifi=
ed=20
projects including long-term supply/demand analysis and, natural gas=20
transportation capacity trading opportunities.
=20
There is an expectation of some customer overlap between the gas and power=
=20
groups; for example, the combination utilities and the IPP=01,s.  The teams=
 will=20
coordinate with regard to the combination utilities like Con. Edison or=20
PG&E.  With regard to the IPP=01,s, to the extent that the product offering=
=20
involves an underlying power position, the power teams will manage. We have=
=20
asked Janet Dietrich to coordinate such overlaps between the two=20
organizations in Houston.=20

e) Technical/Restructuring - In the effort to consolidate and centralize ou=
r=20
technical resources (engineering, development, operations, pipeline) to=20
ensure that this skill base is available to all ENA groups and utilized=20
productively across the organization, Brian Redmond will form and manage th=
e=20
Technical Services Group.  This group will manage ENA=01,s technical risks =
and=20
will provide, on a cost basis, technical services for the entire ENA=20
organization. This group will manage the interface with EE&CC and OEC.  In=
=20
addition, the Restructuring Group, currently managed by Dick Lydecker, will=
=20
report to Brian Redmond.  This group is currently monetizing a large portio=
n=20
of the merchant investment portfolio given our current strategies.  This=20
group will have continuing responsibility to manage troubled commodity and=
=20
capital transactions that need considerable time and attention to manage ri=
sk=20
and monetize.=20

In addition to these responsibilities, Brian will manage the pending sale a=
nd=20
transition of the HPL asset over the next couple quarters as regulatory and=
=20
securities approvals are obtained in order to complete the sale.  Brian wil=
l=20
report to the EA OOC.

f) Principal Investing  =01)  with the departure of Jeff Donahue to new=20
opportunities in EBS, ENA=01,s venture capital function will be managed by=
=20
Michael L. Miller.  This group makes small investments in distributed=20
generation, power quality and technology companies that can benefit from=20
Enron=01,s distribution channels and expertise.  Michael will report to the=
 EA=20
OOC.

g) Corporate Development =01) Tim Detmering will assume the corporate=20
development responsibilities for ENA as Jeff transitions to his new role an=
d=20
will report to the EA OOC.

h) Generation Investments =01) there will be no changes to this group manag=
ed by=20
Dave Duran. Dave will continue to report to the EA OOC.

i) Energy Capital Resources =01) there will be no changes to this group=20
currently lead by C. John Thompson and Scott Josey.  John and Scott will=20
continue to report to the EA OOC.

As a final note in the interest of keeping things simple, Enron Americas wi=
ll=20
have two operating divisions  - Enron North America and Enron South America=
. =20
As a result, we will continue to conduct business under these two operating=
=20
companies; therefore, eliminating the need to change legal entities et al. =
=20
If you are currently a commercial employee of ENA or ESA you will continue =
to=20
conduct business in that company.=20

We look forward to another exciting year in the North American energy=20
market.  This is certainly a company unrivaled in the marketplace with the=
=20
most talented employees.  The opportunities are endless.  We wish you and=
=20
your family a very happy and safe holiday season.

To contribute our personal best at ENRON, our conduct must promote respectful 
and co-operative work relationships. Workplace harassment conflicts with 
ENRON's vision and values and violates Company policy.  Harassment also can 
violate federal and state laws.  By understanding what harassment is and its 
potential harm, we can prevent it in our workplace.

We are pleased to announce that all employees of EWS and EES will receive 
harassment prevention training soon.  This training is mandatory for all 
ENRON employees.

During this training you will:

 Be able to recognize harassment
 Learn to take precautions against being harassed
 Learn to avoid being considered a harasser
 Know how to address a situation involving harassment
 Learn how harassment prevention is consistent with ENRON values

Please click here (  )  to sign up for the session of your choice.    If you 
have problems registering or have any questions, please call 713 853-0357.

As everyone is surely aware after last night's going away party, John Forney 
is heading back to Houston to trade the Short Term Entergy market.  Bill 
Williams III will be assuming responsibility for the Real Time desk and will 
report to Greg Wolfe.  There are three major areas of responsibility that 
Greg and Bill will be focussing on in 2001.  The first is the management of 
EPMI's physical power flows.  This entails checking out with counterparties, 
handling cuts, and ensuring that all of our risk and settlement systems 
reflect the proper information.  The second area is trading done by the Real 
Time group.  Each day, our Real Time desk combs the market looking for 
attractive trading opportunities.  The third area is the Services Desk.  The 
Services Desk provides scheduling and settlements services to customers who 
don't have the staff or systems to do it themselves.  We have seen our 
Services business grow dramatically this year.

Greg Wolfe will be ultimately responsible for the efforts of the Real Time 
desk and our Services business.  Les Rawson will continue in his role on the 
Services desk and will report to Greg.  Bill Williams will be responsible for 
the day to day operations of the Real Time desk.  Greg will continue to work 
closely with the middle market group and will maintain some of his coverage 
responsibilities.  Chris Foster will continue to manage the Middle Market 
group.

Lately, people have been asking about anonymity.  It seems that some might 
like to go "incognito" on eSpeak.  But, the purpose of eSpeak is to encourage 
open communication, and communication can't be open unless all participants 
are open about who they are.  So, we will continue to require you to log in 
with your eThink IDs and passwords if you want to ask a question during an 
eSpeak event.
There are ways to ask questions anonymously at Enron.  You may send an e-mail 
to the Office of the Chairman e-mail address -- this goes to Ken Lay and Jeff 
Skilling.  You may also use interoffice mail to send a printed question to 
Ken or Jeff anonymously.
These two avenues have always been available.  It bears mentioning, however, 
that they have not been used nearly as much since eSpeak hit the scene.  You 
might say that open communication has caught on at Enron.

Hi Corry and Kate,

Option Exercise has been fixed and migrated to stage.  Could you (or members 
from your group) please test it and let me know if it is working according to 
the way you use it?  Although we did some pretty thorough regression 
testing,  we want to ensure that we didn't miss anything from a user 
perspective since this is such an important Enpower application.  We are 
hoping to release Option Exercise to prod either later today, or early 
tomorrow, once we have gotten your approval.

If you have any questions or comments, please email or call me at:  
(713)853-9863.

Thanks,
Nadine (Enpower-QA).

To further the process of reaching the stated objectives of increasing Enro=
n=20
America=01,s Velocity of Capital and associated Return on Invested Capital,=
 we=20
have decided to create a Capital Book. The Capital Book will have no profit=
=20
target associated with it and will be managed by Joe Deffner. The purpose o=
f=20
creating this book is to ensure that all transactions within Enron Americas=
,=20
with any form of capital requirement, are structured correctly and are=20
allocated the appropriate cost of capital charge.=20

The previous numbers used in the Business Plans at the beginning of this ye=
ar=20
will remain for all transactions in place and where we hold assets.=20
Therefore, on any assets currently held within each business area, the=20
capital charge will remain at 15%. Internal ownership of these assets will =
be=20
maintained by the originating Business Unit subject to the Internal Ownersh=
ip=20
Policy outlined below.

The cost of capital associated with all transactions in Enron Americas will=
=20
be set by Joe. This process is separate and apart from the current RAC=20
process for transactions which will continue unchanged.

Capital investments on balance sheet will continue to accrue a capital char=
ge=20
at the previously established rate of 15%. Transactions which are structure=
d=20
off credit will receive a pure market pass through of the actually incurred=
=20
cost of capital as opposed to the previous 15% across the board charge.=20
Transactions which are structured off balance sheet, but on credit will be=
=20
priced based upon the financial impact on Enron America=01,s overall credit=
=20
capacity.

On transactions that deploy capital through the trading books, the Capital=
=20
Book will take a finance reserve on each transaction, similar to the way th=
e=20
Credit Group takes a credit reserve. This finance reserve will be used=20
specifically to fund the capital required for the transaction. As noted=20
above, the Capital Book will have no budget and will essentially charge out=
=20
to the origination and trading groups at actual cost.

By sending market-based capital pricing signals internally, Enron America=
=01,s=20
sources of capital and liquidity should be better optimized across the=20
organization.=20

Enron is forming a new organization - - the Enron Xcelerator - - to drive the 
formation and development of new businesses at Enron.  Enron's unique ability 
to start and develop new businesses has driven most of our growth over the 
years.  Lou L. Pai, currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Energy Services, will 
lead the Xcelerator.  Over his years at Enron, Lou has been key to the 
creation and rapid growth of our wholesale gas, wholesale power and energy 
service businesses.  The existing business units will continue their 
development of core businesses, while the Xcelerator will be responsible for 
developing new business opportunities that are natural extensions of Enron's 
business model and core skills, but not currently under development elsewhere 
in Enron.

Dave Delainey, currently President and CEO of Enron Americas, will become 
Chairman and CEO of Enron Energy Services.  Dave brings a wealth of 
experience and accomplishment from Enron Wholesale Services' businesses where 
he led the growth of our Canadian business and our North American origination 
activity and, most recently, had a great year in Enron Americas.

Dave is forming an Office of the Chairman in EES.  Joining Dave in the Office 
of the Chairman are Dan Leff, President of EES, Global Energy Services, and 
Marty Sunde, President of EES, Global Marketing and Services.  Dan and Marty 
have been instrumental in the development and execution of the successful EES 
business model.  Also joining the Office of the Chairman of EES is Janet 
Dietrich as Chief Operating Officer.  Janet, currently is Managing Director 
in Enron Americas, where she has been successful in many of Enron Wholesale's 
core businesses, including gas trading, risk management and structural 
origination.  Tom White will continue as Vice Chairman of EES and will focus 
on the development and expansion of EES' customer relationships.  Lou, Tom, 
Dan, Marty and the entire EES organization have developed a great business 
model with great growth prospects.  EES has become an essential part of 
Enron's market valuation and growth story.  This new leadership structure 
will enable EES to continue on its path of sustained growth and increasing 
profitability.

John Lavorato will succeed Dave as President and CEO of Enron Americas.  John 
has been an essential part of Enron's energy trading success over the years 
and is a key part of Enron Wholesale Services' continuing success story.  
Joining John is Louise Kitchen, currently President and CEO of Enron 
NetWorks.  Louise, who accelerated Enron's outstanding growth with the 
deployment of EnronOnline, will take over as Chief Operating Officer of Enron 
Americas.

Philippe Bibi, currently Chief Operating Officer of Enron NetWorks will take 
over as President and CEO of Enron NetWorks.  Under Philippe's leadership, 
Enron has become a technology leader and the leading e-commerce company.  
Joining Philippe as Chief Operating Officer is Greg Piper, currently Managing 
Director of Enron NetWorks.  Greg currently leads Enron NetWork's origination 
activity and was responsible for the creation and deployment of ClickPaper, 
Enron's successful online pulp and paper marketplace.

Please join us in congratulating all of these individuals on their 
achievements and their new responsibilities.

What is eSpeak?

eSpeak is an interactive Q&A forum on the eThink intranet site where we will 
be holding scheduled events with a variety of people on a variety of 
subjects.  Joe Sutton is our first guest speaker.

For one hour, you have an opportunity to ask Joe how Enron can break down 
communication barriers.  Share your ideas with him for innovative ways to 
communicate and tell him how you want to receive information.  Also, what can 
Joe personally do to encourage better communication across business units, 
within teams and with your co-workers?

How to sign up for eSpeak

If you haven't already signed up on the eThink site, you will be required to 
register before you can participate in an eSpeak event.  This may take a few 
minutes, so register as early as you can.
? You will be asked to enter your email address and operating company.
? A "userid" and password will be automatically sent to your email address.
? Use the "userid" and password to log onto the site.  (An easy way to enter 
the password into the required field is to copy and paste it from your email.)
? You will be immediately prompted to change your password once you are in 
eThink.
? Each time you participate in eThink forums you will be asked to log on, so 
keep your password simple!

We want to know what you eThink!

Your interaction and feedback will have an impact on the development of 
eSpeak, so please send your comments, suggestions or ideas to

Earlier this week I was pleased to announce that Enron's new procurement an=

supported by Houston-based Accounts Payable processing centers.  The new=20
iBuyit Payables system will increase the efficiency of the accounts payable=

and routing them electronically for coding, payment authorization, and issu=

resolution.=20

In preparation for this transition, there are some simple changes to the wa=

o=20
the purchaser electronically through iBuyit. =20

Do I need to use an EID for non-purchase orders?
Yes.  When ordering goods and services with a non-purchase order, the=20
purchaser should provide the vendor with the appropriate EID.  It is your=
=20
responsibility to communicate to vendors that an EID is now required for=20
non-purchase orders.

Do I need to use an EID for purchase orders?
No.  When ordering goods and services with an approved purchase order, you=
=20
should provide the vendor with a purchase order number as you currently do.=
 =20


What if I do not know my EID?
All Enron employees are assigned an EID number. If you purchase goods and=
=20
services on behalf of Enron, you need to know your personal EID number.  Yo=
u=20
can access your EID number in eHRonline.  Logon to eHRonline, choose=20

For your information, the organizational change below will not bring about a 
change in administrative coverage for West Power Trading.  Anna Mehrer will 
continue to support Greg Wolfe as part of the Middle Market and Services 
group.  Kathy Sheppard will continue to support Bill Williams III and Real 
Time.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Subject: Organizational Update

As everyone is surely aware after last night's going away party, John Forney 
is heading back to Houston to trade the Short Term Entergy market.  Bill 
Williams III will be assuming responsibility for the Real Time desk and will 
report to Greg Wolfe.  There are three major areas of responsibility that 
Greg and Bill will be focussing on in 2001.  The first is the management of 
EPMI's physical power flows.  This entails checking out with counterparties, 
handling cuts, and ensuring that all of our risk and settlement systems 
reflect the proper information.  The second area is trading done by the Real 
Time group.  Each day, our Real Time desk combs the market looking for 
attractive trading opportunities.  The third area is the Services Desk.  The 
Services Desk provides scheduling and settlements services to customers who 
don't have the staff or systems to do it themselves.  We have seen our 
Services business grow dramatically this year.

Greg Wolfe will be ultimately responsible for the efforts of the Real Time 
desk and our Services business.  Les Rawson will continue in his role on the 
Services desk and will report to Greg.  Bill Williams will be responsible for 
the day to day operations of the Real Time desk.  Greg will continue to work 
closely with the middle market group and will maintain some of his coverage 
responsibilities.  Chris Foster will continue to manage the Middle Market 
group.

Steel Origination=20
Since its inception in September, the steel group has grown to over 40=20

received positive feedback.  Additionally, the group has executed both=20
physical and financial trades and has 10 products posted on EnronOnline.

Steel prices are at a 20-year low, several large producers have recently=20

both liquidity and price risk management. At this time, Enron is the only=

Samuel,

Please set up Kate Symes as a trader with access to all of the West power 
desks.    She is taking over for Carla Hoffman as a Deal Control specialist.
She frequently has to enter California deals (PX,  ISO,  etc) in addition to 
bilateral transaction deal entry.

If you have questions,  please give me a call.

Thanks,

FYI...

Kate, I believe you asked that short name changes not be done before 7:a.  
Whether that's your time or my time, I know I won't be doing them at that 
time.  :-)  It will more likely be around 10:a CST, and then I will send 
notification to Jeremy, Sanjeev and Oscar.  Just know that every Friday, 
short name changes will be made.   Give me a call if you have any concerns.

Happy Holidays!

Subject: ERMS Short Name Changes

Dear All,

This note is to summarise our meeting today regarding the timing and 
notification of changes to ERMS short names in GCP and ERMS. 

Timing
As discussed, the Credit Aggregation System requires that short names are in 
sync in GCP and ERMS.  As a result, we agreed to change ERMS short names in 
both systems every Friday morning and only at that time.

Notification
Notification of the need to change a short name in ERMS currently comes to 
ERMS IT from a variety of sources.  It was agreed that an effort would be 
made by GCP to centralise all requests in the formal Name Changes & Mergers 
Report.  Sanjeev/Oscar are to aid this effort by forwarding to Cheryl Johnson 
the names of people who currently bypass the Report and contact ERMS IT 
directly.

Please let me know if there are any comments on or additions to this summary.

Thanks, and happy holidays!

Kathryn

As many of you have already noticed, this year Enron will be closing its 
offices on Monday, January 15 in honor of Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.  This 
is the first time we have observed this national holiday, and I am certain 
that many of you will be pleased to know that the executive committee has 
decided that we will continue to do so in the future.

Enron continues to observe 10 holidays each year (including two floater 
holidays) and provides one additional discretionary holiday for our 
employees.   For a complete listing of Enron's holiday schedule, go to

Effective in the California scheduling sheet for 12/10 on, we are using a new 
method to access Enpower data.  There will be very little difference to users 
of the sheet, but behind the scenes we have substituted calling an Oracle 
stored procedure via ADO for what we had before, which was executing a SQL 
string via DAO.  When you go to pull in the daily data you may notice a 
slight difference in the form: the choice we had before of selecting between 
ADO and DAO is gone.

There is one difference in the sheet you need to know about.  This concerns 
what happens when a deal with a counter party that does not exist in our 
local counter party tables comes in via the Oracle query.  In the past, this 
counter party and the deal's hourly amounts would appear in the spreadsheet, 
but when we went to write CAPS templates, that counter party would not 
appear.  Someone would then tell me needed to add the counter party to our 
local counter party tables.

Now what will happen is that the name UNKNOWN will appear in the sheet with 
the hourly amounts for the missing counter party.  As before, whatever this 
missing counter party is will not appear in the CAPS templates.  You will 
still need to tell us what counter party is missing.  You will figure out 
which one it is in the same way you have in the past.  We are working on a 
process that will look up these missing counter parties and takes care of 
everything automatically.

To all:

Over the past few months, Energy Operations has formally established global 
standards.   Exception reporting will officially begin for the West Desk on 
Monday, November 20th.  The exception reporting around these standards will:
help us gauge our performance and highlight areas for improvement
better allocate resources to issue areas
ensure individual and global business controllers are up to date as to 
arising issues

To accomplish this, numerous requirements have been established.  The  
requirement that affects trading is as follows:

Transactions are recorded accurately and timely (completeness, accuracy)
Transactions are recorded with 100% accuracy and valued appropriately in an 
approved risk system for the applicable product
Transactions are input into Enpower or TAGG on date of trade (prior to calc)

HOW THIS AFFECTS WEST TRADERS:

The Risk group in Portland and Confirmations group in Houston will now begin 
reporting any exceptions to the above requirement on a daily basis.   Any 
deals entered late, incorrectly or changed after the calc will require full 
written explanation to the Global Risk Controls group (this includes trader 
name).  The materiality of the deal is not relevant, you can be written up 
for 1 MW deals or 200 MW deals.  The Global Risk Controls group is looking 
for flaws in the process, whether it be people-related or system related.  

This exception reporting begins on Monday.  Please come to the Risk group 
with any questions you may have, we would like the West Desk to appear on the 
exception report as infrequently as possible.  If you have any special deal 
types that you believe will be in violation of the above requirement, please 
notify Risk so we can communicate this to Global Risk Controls.

Thanks for your help in this matter,

West Risk

The people on the "To" list have been selected to attend an "Energy Math" 
training session which will be held on March 7th from 9 AM to 5 PM in the 
River Room at Two World Trade Center.  Amy Fitzpatrick will provide you with 
a course outline and background reading (helpful but not mandatory) by Monday 
morning.  We want to have 15 people attend this course.  I realize that this 
is short notice, so if you can't attend please let me know ASAP so that I can 
find a replacement.

I have been working with Jon Koomey, who will be teaching the course, over 
the last couple of months to tailor a training session that will meet the 
needs of people who work on this floor.  The goal is to provide a 
comprehensive overview of computations and analytical tools that are the 
foundation of analyzing energy problems.  The course is loosely based on a 
graduate level course offered at Berkeley (which Jon has taught and several 
people on the floor have taken) and on a book that Jon Koomey recently 
published.

This is the first time that this course, in its current form, is being 
offered.  As a result, it should be viewed as a work in progress.  Chris 
Calger and I would like every person in this office to have the opportunity 
to take this course between now and the end of the year.  We have selected a 
cross-section of people for this first session.  Some people have a lot of 
experience doing analysis while others have little training in this area.  
Some have been working in the energy industry for several years while others 
are new to the business.  We are hoping that the course will be helpful to 
people with different backgrounds.  Each participant in the class is not only 
responsible for learning as much as you can, but is also required to give 
constructive feedback to Jon Koomey and to us on how to make the course 
better.  You will have both formal and informal opportunities to provide 
feedback.  This feedback is part of the program.  If you aren't willing or 
don't feel that you have the time to take this one-day course and provide us 
with thoughtful, constructive suggestions on how to improve the course for 
the next time please let me know and your name will be removed from the list 
for this session.

Based on the feedback from this course, we will make modifications before the 
next course is offered in a month or so.  With your help, we will be able to 
improve the training for the people who come after you.  Thanks in advance 
for your help with this, and I hope that you find this training to be helpful.

I am excited to announce a major initiative called iBuyit, a new online 
purchase and payment tool.  Each of you will be able to use iBuyit to order 
or approve purchases from pens to pipe and cable to computers.  Our Global 
Strategic Sourcing (GSS) and Global Accounting groups have teamed up with 
each of your Business Units to build a tool designed to meet your specific 
needs.

Special iBuyit features include:
? An eCatalog to help you quickly find the items you need
? Shopping baskets to store your purchases
? Simple recurring purchases 
? Automatic routing of invoices for coding and approval

iBuyit will be implemented in stages across ETS, EBS, EES, EWS, Corporate and 
Europe during 2001.  

Over the next few months, you will be hearing more about iBuyit from your 
business unit leadership, including what it can do for you and when you can 
expect to use it.

Hello, I just spoke with Joe Hunter.  His group is supposed to call you and 
ask if you want to ADP the deal.  Then they notify the brokers to let them 
know.    Joe Hunter's group will handle this part of the process in the 
future.  In the future when these trades are entered into Enpower we would 
like for you all to put a comment in the deal saying that it is a deal that 
when physical off of the NYMEX.  We do not want to confirm these 
transactions.  We sent a confirmation letter on this deal and that is what 
caused all of the confusion.   Regardless if the deal has been ADP'd or not 
we do not want to confirm these transactions since they were originally done 
on the NYMEX.  So please let everyone know to put a note in the deal so we 
won't confirm them and hopefully we won't have all of this confusion again in 
the future.

Thanks for you help!

Let me know if you need me to do anything else.
Melissa

I've spoken with Tim Cannon at Sempra, who said that what he needed was for 
our broker and his broker to talk to each other and agree that this deal has 
gone physical and is no longer on NYMEX. Then I talked to Matt Motley, who 
talked to his broker, who will now talk to Sempra's broker and hopefully 
solve this once and for all.

You're right though. There's no need for it to be this difficult, especially 
when we do it every month. I think it would be really helpful if we could get 
a hold of Dave Dupre to find out how this was handled before. If we can't, I 
guess we'll just have to determine who will take responsibility for making 
sure these deals are recognized as physical by both parties. I would be happy 
to do that each month when we exercise our futures options, but I want 
everyone involved to be aware of the procedure.

Thanks a lot for helping on this. Please let me know if you find out anymore.

Thanks,
Kate

Hello, I left a message for David Dupre and he has not called me back.  If 
you want to have Matt call Tim Cannon at Sempra that would be fine.  His 
phone number is (203) 355-5190.  I don't know why this has been so 
difficult.  If I hear from David I will let you know.  I want to know how he 
handled these deals in the past.

Just curious - did you ever catch up with Larry Joe Hunter regarding the Long 
Term Southwest desk's futures deal with Sempra? I'm wondering if I should 
grab Matt Motley before he goes home today to let him know he needs to get a 
hold of Tim Cannon about the ADT. Let me know when and if you talk to him.

Thanks,

As many of you have already noticed, this year Enron will be closing its 
offices on Monday, January 15 in honor of Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.  This 
is the first time we have observed this national holiday, and I am certain 
that many of you will be pleased to know that the executive committee has 
decided that we will continue to do so in the future.

Enron continues to observe 10 holidays each year (including two floater 
holidays) and provides one additional discretionary holiday for our 
employees.   For a complete listing of Enron's holiday schedule, go to

As you are aware, Enron signed an agreement with Blockbuster Inc. last summer 
to launch an entertainment on-demand service.  We announced today that we are 
discontinuing our exclusive relationship with Blockbuster in order to expand 
the offering by developing direct relationships with content providers and 
distribution partners.

We have made tremendous progress toward our goal of becoming the leading 
provider of entertainment on-demand over a digital platform.  We rolled out 
the trial service in Seattle, Portland, Salt Lake City and New York in 
December, and today subscribers are buying movies on-demand using the service 
we created.

However, the exclusive relationship with Blockbuster has not yielded the 
quantity and quality of movies needed to drive demand for this exciting, new 
on-demand service.  Now that we have proven the concept, we want to take our 
service to the next level by adding content and subscribers on an accelerated 
basis.  We feel that this can be best achieved by pursuing entertainment 
on-demand independently.

We intend to initiate discussions with various content providers for 
delivering their content over the Enron platform.  We remain very positive 
about the potential of this business for EBS and Enron and will keep you 
apprised of our progress.

Good morning,
We have a note out on the proposed decision on PG&E Corp. and Edison 
International.

? On January 3, the ALJ issued a proposed decision on the purchased power 
undercollection emergency at PG&E Corp. and Edison International. A final 
decision will be issued on January 4.

? The proposal contains interim rate increases of 7%-15% for different 
customer classes. The surcharges would be subject to refunds and 
substantially lower than the 26% and 30% increases requested by PG&E Corp. 
and Edison International, respectively.

? The proposed rate increases would be effective for 90 days. During this 
time the CPUC would consider a more comprehensive audit of the utilities' 
financial condition.

? Significantly, the proposal rejects the utilities' request to end the rate 
freeze. The order would also order the utilities to credit TCBA 
overcollection to the TRA undercollection balance.

? Clearly, the risk of insolvency is much higher now. If passed, the order 
will fall far short of resolving the financial crisis facing PG&E Corp. and 
Edison International. Even if the utilities avoid bankruptcy, we now 
anticipate, more than ever, a tremendous amount of uncertainty concerning the 
economic value of these stocks.

Please call us with any questions you may have.
Regards,
Paul Patterson, 212-325-5876

Over the last couple of years we have had numerous social events including 
holiday parties, company-sponsored outings to Edgefield, post-quarterly 
meeting outings, and going away parties.  While I hope that people thoroughly 
enjoy themselves, I ask that you keep in mind that we all have to act 
professionally and responsibly during and after these events.  I have been 
working with Chris Calger and Amy Fitzpatrick to put together some guidelines 
for company-sponsored social events:

The company will provide soft drinks, beer, and wine.  You may choose to 
order other beverages at your expense.
Functions will run for a specified period of time.  If there is an open bar, 
we will establish a time certain after which Enron will not pay for any 
additional drinks.
If you require assisance getting home, please contact a taxi and submit the 
fare for expense reimbursement with no questions asked.  The last thing in 
the world we want is to have people break the law or put their safety and the 
safety of others in jeopardy.

Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks for your cooperation.

Many of you know that my wife, Sue, and I are expecting a baby any day now.  
When Sue stopped by the office on Tuesday, we were both pleasantly surprised 
by the wonderful gift basket and gift certificate to -- you guessed it -- 
Baby's R Us that the people on the floor gave to us.  The sage advise and 
warm wishes expressed on the card were particularly appreciated.  Thank you 
so much.

Tim Belden

ps - it's a boy

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

East Power Group
The East Power Group is off to another strong start in 2001.  The realignme=
nt=20
of the group into regional business units with joint trading, mid-marketing=

and origination operations has proven to be a catalyst for deal flow,=20
producing both a high volume of transactions and high value.  More=20
transactions were executed in January than any month last year, including o=
ne=20
deal that will bring tremendous strategic value to Enron as well.

Executed in January, was the purchase of two 35 MW coal-fired cogeneration=
=20
facilities located in southeastern North Carolina.  ENA will supply steam t=
o=20
the industrial host, Alamac Knit Fabrics, and will sell power into the=20
merchant market.  The plants are inside Carolina Power & Light's service=20
territory, which is connected to AEP, Virginia Power, Duke, SCEG and SCPSA.=
 =20
These plants are the first purely merchant facilities in North Carolina. =

This deal exemplifies how Enron leverages its talent in that originators fr=
om=20
the East Power Group and Industrial Markets Group joined forces to bring th=
is=20
deal to execution.  They also leveraged the Global Markets group to manage=

the coal supply and emissions issues.

Prospects going forward look promising as a number of high value transactio=

are in the pipeline.  Of particular note is The Sandhill Power Project, a 1=

Additionally, the Fort Pierce (Florida) City Council voted 5 to 0 in favor =

For the steel group, Doug Parsons and Yana Kristal are providing market=20

I just created a new spreadsheet for the 13th.  I created this sheet from the 
7th, which was the last sheet we had without this little version problem.

Note that any special jurry-rigging you have done to the sheet in the last 
few days WILL NOT BE THERE because I had to go back to the 7th.

To repeat my favorite phrase of the day:

NEVER, EVER SELECT NEW WINDOW!

I would like to announce the following management changes within the Analyst

Traci Warner will assume responsibility for Recruiting for the Western 
Hemisphere.  Traci joined Enron's Associate Program in 1995 and has held 
positions in Business Development, Origination, and Public Relations at Enron 
Energy Services, Enron North America and Enron Broadband Services.

Ted Bland will assume responsibility for Career Development (including 
rotations) for the Western Hemisphere.  Ted has been with Enron since 1989 
and has held several roles in Origination and Business Development within 
Enron Wholesale Services.  Most recently, Ted was assigned to the 
commercialization of some activities within Human Resources.

Anna Jansson, who is based in London, will continue to lead all efforts for 
the Associate / Analyst Program in the Eastern Hemisphere.  Anna has been 
with Enron Europe for the past three years and, most recently, has been 
responsible for setting up the EBS Human Resources function in Europe.

Please join me in working with Traci, Ted and Anna to ensure the success of 
this important program.

The IRS has announced that the standard mileage rate for use of a personal  
automobile for business will be 34 1/2 cents per mile starting January 1, 
2001.  Enron's policy is to follow IRS guidelines, so use this rate for all 
mileage incurred on or after that date.

Friends and co-workers:

 I have accepted a job trading next-day power in the Entergy region effective 
January 2nd.      I will be reporting directly  to Rogers Herndon and,  
ultimately,   Kevin Presto.        This move gives me the chance to be closer 
to family and an opportunity to further develop my trading skills.      This 
would not have been possible without  the tremendous opportunities that were 
available to me during my three year stay in Portland.    

I would like to thank the entire floor for their help in making the Real Time 
& also the Services Desk a success this year.       The decision to leave was 
extremely hard,   given this level of support.     

 I am confident that next year will be a great one for each of you and I wish 
you luck in your careers at the Big E!       

Thanks,     

JMF

Sharen:

As we discussed, here is the Del. Pt. language for sales at NP and SP15.  For 
any sale beyond April 2002 (not purchases), we might want to use this 
language, but only if the trader requests it in a note on the deal entry.  If 
the trader does not request it, it is our understanding that you will try to 
catch it and notify us to make sure the new language is not desired by the 
trader (Use me as a contact and I will ask the trader).  It is understood, 
however, that if the trader does not request the language and you do not 
catch it the trader bears the risk.

Thanks

Chris

with and have direct accountability to the business units it supports.

This realignment also centralizes our engineering and operations capabiliti=
es=20
in a single business segment and should ensure that innovation and best=20
practices are shared and implemented across our many operations and will al=
so=20
allow for better identification of priorities and more effective allocation=

of resources to these projects.  Consistent with this approach, Development=

Engineering will have dual reporting to both EEOS and the business units=20
which they support. =20

With an extensive and varied portfolio of assets around the world and a wid=

variety of new development opportunities available to Enron, it is critical=
=20
that we continue to maintain the best in class capability to design,=20
construct, commission, and effectively manage and operate Enron=01,s assets=

global basis.

This new global business unit should insure that we will continue to enhanc=

as we advance our business strategy around the world.

Please join us in congratulating Brian and Keith on their new assignments.

We would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who took the time =
to=20
respond to the Pulse survey conducted in October.  Your feedback is very mu=
ch=20
appreciated.
The survey helps identify inhibitors that keep you from accomplishing your=
=20
job, while helping us assess the company=01,s progress toward removing barr=
iers=20
that keep employees from achieving their personal best.
Out of the 2,299 ENA/EGM/EIM employees invited to participate in the survey=
,=20
1,478, or 64% responded.  Enron uses an outside firm, Watson Wyatt, to=20
tabulate data and report results.  A synopsis of what we heard from you has=
=20
been added to our intranet site.  The site address is=20
http://home.ena.enron.com/pulse/.
Our Strengths

Strengths are based on the highest percentages of favorable responses to=20
survey questions:=20

 * Employees are satisfied with their benefits     87%
 * Employees can believe information from top management   78%
 * Employees would recommend ENA/EGM/EIM as a good place to work 78%
 * Supervisors/Managers treat their employees fairly    76%=20
 * Supervisors/Managers encourage teamwork     73%
 * People are treated with respect       72%
 * ENA/EGM/EIM is well managed       72%

Improvement Opportunities

Improvement opportunities are based on the lowest percentages of favorable=
=20
responses to survey questions:

 * Communication/Information Flow       35%
 * Information Technology        32%
 * Workload          26%

We are pleased with these results because they exhibit a strong belief in=
=20
Enron=01,s core values of Respect, Integrity, Communication and Excellence.=
 =20
These results are indicative of the quality of our employees at all levels.

The Pulse survey enables us to focus on real issues affecting each employee=
. =20
We will evaluate these results and consider remedies to the inhibitors that=
=20
affect us on a daily basis.  Your ideas are welcomed and we will be seeking=
=20
your input.  Great strides have been made since the first survey in 1996, a=
nd=20
we intend to continue in this vein. =20

Please plan to take part in future surveys, which will continue providing=
=20
valuable information to help build a successful organization.  Again, thank=
=20
you for your input.

I'm forwarding your message to the group here -we all wanna give you a big 
hug!  I never really said anything to Carla because I liked working with her, 
but that was always kind of a sticking point with the folks here in Houston 
-she never would tell us when something was changed so we would always have 
to run extra reports to make sure that we caught everything that might have 
gone into pending.  It wasn't a huge deal, but it certainly helps if you 
wanna drop an email or give us a call to let us know when anything changes 
-that's how we do it here; everyone knows to tell documentation when they 
revise any deals.  Also, don't forget to put notes in anytime you change 
anything in Deal Entry to CYA.  So glad to have you and I can't wait to meet 
you!
Not sure how good a tan you're gonna get around the New Year, though.  I 
could let you know about some good tanning salons while you're in town (j/k).
Thanks again!
Kim

Subject: Re: Deal #471740 Mieco  

She didn't "warn" me that you were cheesy, but she did mention you were a 
peach too! And anyway, I love cheesy e-mails.

But since I'm writing, I might as well mention that I have a deal that was 
changed last night by one of our traders, and I think it needs to be 
re-confirmed. It's deal number 476435 - Mark Fischer caught his own error and 
changed the delivery point from Palo Verde to Mid-C. 

And speaking of confirms and all that good stuff, that's one area I was never 
really told about; so if you or anyone else in your group has any information 
to share - anything that I could do to make your jobs easier or to make our 
jobs synchronize better - PLEASE let me know. I'm very humble about how much 
I have to learn, so the more people teach me, the better.

I believe I'll be coming down to Houston after the new year to meet people, 
tour the place, and get a suntan! So if you don't want to call or e-mail with 
every detail, you can compile them all and give me the run-down when I'm 
there. Whatever works for you guys - just let me know.

Thanks a lot,
Kate

a vehicle to submit research requests.  eSource's researchers and industry 
specialists are available to all Enron business units to provide timely and 
cost efficient research, to work with individuals or groups to fulfill one 
time research requests, or to design ongoing, customized monitoring projects 
or news updates.

We are pleased to announce that Dave Duran will replace Janet Dietrich to 
co-lead the East Power Wholesale business at Enron.  Dave will continue to 
run the highly successful Generation Investments business.

The East Power team will continue to have a single income statement and joint 
accountability toward its financial goals as was set out in the 
reorganization in late 2000.

Within Dave's Generation Investments group; Michael J. Miller will lead the 
effort to acquire new QF projects, Chuck Ward will lead the restructuring 
efforts on existing QF projects, and Carl Tricoli will lead the initiative to 
develop and market capital products to IPP's.  In addition, Mitch Robinson 
will lead a new initiative to evaluate opportunities with coal fired 
generation.  Dave and Kevin Presto will attempt to leverage the Generation 
Investments business and the Origination activities through a tighter 
integration between the two groups.

Dave has over nine years of direct experience in gas and power origination at 
Enron including an outstanding performance over the last couple of years 
building the Generation Investments business.  He also spent two years 
managing Enron's Retail Gas Marketing business in Dublin, Ohio.

The East Power group has had a great start to the year and we feel confident 
that the leadership team of Kevin and Dave will lead to continued success.

Listed below are dates and actions required to finish the year-end PRC 
process.  Please make a note of these dates and perform any required 
actions.  If you have questions, please contact me.

December 15:  All PRC meetings and ratings will be finalized for Sr. Director 
and below positions.
January 25:  Performance reviews must be completed by this date.  All 
performance review information, including bonus payment and salary increase, 
must be communicated to employees.
February 5:  Bonus payment made to eligible employees.

Since we have many new employees, I thought I would provide the following 
information and philosophy about our performance review system.  Enron is 
very proud of its employees and is known for hiring the most talented people 
available in the marketplace.  I believe that is true in West Power Trading.  
The challenge for managers is to provide valuable feedback, and the most 
accurate rating, to employees so they can enhance their performance and 
progress in their current roles and within the company.

There are basically two objectives to our performance review system.

Career Development/Feedback on Performance:  This part of our performance 
review system includes the meetings and discussions surrounding the following 
four documents that are in each review package:  Goals, Expectations, 
Accomplishments, Feedback.  Employees prepare a listing of their Goals to 
accomplish by the next review period and a list of their Accomplishments 
since the previous review period.  Managers prepare Feedback and prepare a 
list of Expectations during the next review period.  These documents are the 
cornerstone for constructive two-way feedback during a performance review.

Performance Rating:  Enron uses a merit-based approach to determine 
promotions, raises, and bonuses.  This is accomplished in the PRC 
(Performance Review Committee) meetings.  In these meetings, the ENA 
management team assigns a performance rating to each employee.  We attempt to 
make this process as fair and objective as possible.  For West Power Trading 
employees, each person's performance is assessed relative to responsibilities 
defined in the "Expectations" document.  Performance is also gauged relative 
to your peers throughout ENA--Portland, Houston, and Calgary.  Each person's 
manager had tremendous input into this process.  I personally represented 
each person in our group in the final ENA PRC meeting in Houston.  I feel 
confident the process was fair and that the tremendous achievements of our 
office were acknowledged.

The following is a review of the various rating categories.

NEEDS IMPROVEMENT:  Does not meet most expectations.  Demonstrates some of 
the criteria.  Further development needed in most areas.

SATISFACTORY:  Meets many but not all expectations.  Demonstrates most of the 
criteria.  Further development needed in many areas.

STRONG:  Meets most and exceeds some expectations.  Role model for some of 
the criteria.  Further development needed in some areas.

EXCELLENT:  Exceeds most expectations.  Role model for most criteria.  
Further development needs are minimal.

SUPERIOR:  Consistently goes above and beyond expectations.  Role model for 
criteria.  Very little need for growth and change at current level.

My commitment to you is that by January 25, you will receive your 
career/development feedback and your performance rating.  Hopefully this 
information aids you in understanding the PRC review system.  If you have any 
questions about the process, please see your manager or me.  Also, Amy 
FitzPatrick would be happy to answer any questions you have or provide 
assistance with the PRC Process.

I recently went through the list and weeded out the ones that don't have 
deals under them.  Unfortunately, Enpower contains the CPs for Canada and the 
Emissions group, which are sometimes similar names.  Sometimes Europe 
attaches CPs by mistake and we have takenf them out also.  Name changes and 
mergers also complicate things.  What we do is keep an eye out for the 
incorrect CP and try to inform the traders when they are picking the wrong 
CP.   Believe me, if the developers could differentiate the CPs in Global CP, 
it would be done.  I guess the issue is how much time and money it would 
require to change CP to feed just our CPs.  And on APS, they have informed us 
that they are still trading under both names until 1/1/01 and credit is okay 
with this.  I could go on and on about all the issues, but you get the idea.  
Welcome to Enron!

Subject: Enpower: Counterparty Name Changes

Hi Rhonda -

I was told you're the person to contact regarding changes in the Enpower 
counterparty list. Several items are outdated or have gone through many 
different versions, and it's made somewhat of a confusing situation for the 
traders and others who do deal entry. My sensitivity to this is heightened 
because I'm new to the Deal Control position here at the Portland West Desk, 
and I'm still getting used to which names we use and which we don't. Monica 
Lande suggested I ask you about it, although she pointed out that if we've 
ever booked a deal under any of these counterparty names, then they need to 
stay in the system. 

I'm wondering if there is any way to weed out some of those extra selections. 
For example, Duke and El Paso both have five different names in the system; 
Arizona Public Service Company has become Pinnacle; and other names were just 
tests that are no longer used. 

Please let me know whenever you have a free moment - this is certainly not an 
urgent request, and I completely understand if the list needs to stay as is. 
Just checking.

Thanks,
Kate

The continued growth of the Enron Europe office and related businesses has 
prompted a change in the management of Risk Assessment and Control (RAC) in 
London.  Effective in early January, 2001, Ted Murphy will transfer to the 
London office and manage the RAC activities which includes credit/market risk 
and underwriting. Ted will continue to manage the Enron Global Market Risk 
activities.  Steve Young, currently managing RAC in London, will begin a new 
assignment within  EBS, also in London.

The Houston Market Risk group will be managed by David Port.

As Enron continues to expand its trading and risk management businesses, it 
is vital that trading and credit policies are administered in a consistent 
and accurate manner across the company.  Hopefully this realignment will 
accomplish that goal.

Please join me in congratulating Ted, David and Steve on their new 
assignments.

Everyone,

We have just received an order from the California Attorney General requiring 
all employees (except legal, admin, and human resources staff) to take the 
following steps immediately:

   1.  Save all e-mails, i.e., don't delete any e-mails.
   2.  Do not delete any information in databases.
   3.  Do not delete any word processing files or file fragments.
   4.  Do not delete any excel spreadsheets or calendars or scheduling 
programs. 
   5.  Any other electronic data not otherwise covered.

This request is being made in connection with the California AG's 
investigation into electricity prices.  We do not know how many other 
companies have received a similar order, but there is no reason for us to 
assume at this time that Enron has been singled out.  

Over the next few days we will be working with our technology group to figure 
out the most efficient way to manage this request.  This is a serious matter 
and we strongly urge every person affected by this request to cooperate fully 
with this order.  We appreciate your help with this and will keep you 
apprised of any changes in policy.

Tim Belden and Chris Calger

Rick Causey recently announced a new online purchase and payment tool called 
iBuyit.  One of the special iBuyit components is an automated accounts 
payable feature that will improve the way you code and approve invoices. 

As of May 1, you will be able to access iBuyit Payables and
? choose budget codes from simple drop down menus
? receive e-mail when you have an invoice that needs to be coded and/or 
approved; and
? view an electronic image of the actual invoice

These improvements will help you assign codes more accurately and will reduce 
the time you spend processing invoices for payment.  The AP tool will also 
begin to eliminate the need for coding sheets or other paper information 
currently in use.  

This tool will provide us the opportunity to transition our Houston-based AP 
processing functions to a third party, SourceNet Solutions.  This transition 
is expected to be completed by August 2001.

You will hear more about the iBuyit initiative, features of the AP tool and 
training opportunities in the coming weeks.  Please contact your AP 
representative if you have any questions.

For those of us in Enron Americas, the following is for your information.

I contacted Eric Thode, Director of Public Relations, to ask when we should 
start converting our business cards, letterhead, envelopes, etc., to say 
Enron Americas.  He was traveling at the time he received my message but had 
Jennifer Walker in his office call me back.  Eric recommended we use Enron 
Americas when ordering anything new with the company name on it from this day 
forward.  He thought work was being done on the "big announcement" about 
getting the name changed on everything, and he would contact me next week to 
discuss.  When I hear anything new, I'll let you know.

Contact me if you have any questions.

We have discovered an ingenious new problem plaguing the CA scheduling 
spreadsheet.  I do not know how this happened, but here is the symptom.  You 
open a spreadsheet and you see a little version number behind the name like 1 
or 2.  For example:

ca1212.xls:1
ca1212.xls:2

Sometimes you may see a file's name several times under Window as if you 
somehow have several copies of the same spreadsheet open.  This apparently 
results from selecting Window > New Window.  Never, ever select New Window!  
I repeat: NEVER, EVER SELECT NEW WINDOW!  Once a worksheet has this version 
number it is "contaminated" and all sorts of other problems appear.  I'm sure 
you have noticed new errors popping up when you open or close one of these 
files.

I am going to create a new worksheet for the 13th from an older file that 
does not have one of these version numbers.  And we will hope this doesn't 
happen again.  Please be careful with this.  It sounds trivial but can in 
fact really screw things up.

Several customers were asking me about Gas gen off line due to gas cuts - 
here is an article from Steve at Seattle City Light that adds light to this.

It doesn't say how much capacity was impacted, but it sounds like  a 
localized problem in San Diego rather than a statewide gas import  problem.? 
I thought it was nice of Mr. Winters to add his expert  commentary.

California Power Plants Get Jolt
As Natural-Gas Supplies Are  Cut

By Rebecca Smith
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal  

LOS ANGELES -- Southern California power plants, already stressed to their  
limits last summer, got another jolt this week as a cold snap caused a sharp  
curtailment of supplies of natural gas used to generate electricity. 

The power plants were able to switch to burning oil and continue to produce  
electricity. But the unusual curtailment of natural gas underlines concerns 
that  an increased reliance on gas for power generation across the U.S. is 
putting the  reliability of the nation's electricity supply at risk. 

That's because virtually all power plants now under construction in the U.S.  
burn gas and only gas. The units affected this week in San Diego were able 
to  shift to oil only because they were older plants that originally were  
constructed to burn oil. Generators have been reluctant to add a dual-fuel  
flexibility to plants in recent years because oil is far more polluting than 
gas  and generally has been costlier. 

In California, where gas-supply problems first surfaced on Monday in San  
Diego, there is pessimism about a Hydra-like energy crisis that seems to 
grow  new heads every day. The state weathered three-dozen electrical 
emergencies last  summer, caused by a shortage of electricity. Officials had 
hoped to solve the  problem by speeding up construction of new generating 
plants. Now, they're  finding the state may be building its way out of an 
electrical problem and into  a gas problem. 

One official, who has been warning of the danger of reliance on a single  
fuel, said this week's disruption pointed out the necessity of developing a  
comprehensive energy policy that recognizes how changes in usage of oil, gas 
and  electricity affect each other. "We don't just need new generating 
plants  and transmission lines, we may need pipelines, too," said Terry 
Winter,  chief executive officer of the California Independent System 
Operator, the  organization responsible for maintaining adequate electricity 
supplies.  "You can't look at these things in isolation." 

The natural-gas problems surfaced when the local gas-distribution company,  
San Diego Gas & Electric Co., notified power-plant operators and a handful  
of industrial users that it would be restricting their gas use by about half. 
In  California, residential and small businesses have first crack at natural 
gas,  and industrial uses are regarded as secondary, even if they are 
generating  plants. Dynegy Inc., the Houston-based energy concern that owns  
some of the older plants that serve San Diego, immediately switched to oil. 
But  it didn't like doing so; its plants create three times as much pollution 
when  they burn oil and exhaust valuable air-pollution emission credits that 
power  plants here need to operate. 

The San Diego units couldn't simply be shut down, because the state was 
short  of power. Roughly 30% of the state's capacity already was off-line, 
including  many of its nuclear units, as most of those plants are now 
undergoing repair  after being run at capacity limits throughout the summer. 

What's more, the gas-pipeline system that feeds San Diego isn't big enough 
to  begin with. The system was built primarily to serve residential customers 
and  not big power plants. 

The problems could persist, off and on, through the winter. That's because  
gas-storage levels are down sharply from a year ago throughout the nation, 
but  especially in California, because it ran its gas-fired units so hard 
last  summer. This time last year, Southern California had 87 billion cubic 
feet of  gas in storage. Now, it's roughly 50 billion cubic feet, or 43% 
less. Prices  also have moved up sharply, from roughly $2.50 a million 
British thermal units  to around $8 this week. Nationally, storage levels are 
down about 8% from a year  ago. 

"Gas is trading higher in California than anywhere else in the  nation," said 
John Lavorato, chief operating officer of Enron North  America, a unit of 
Enron Corp. of Houston. But he said they're headed up in  the Northeast, 
based on cold weather forecast for the next 10 days to two weeks.  

High prices for fuel also push up prices for the end product, electricity. 
In  California the average price for electricity to be delivered Thursday was 
$228  per megawatt hour. That's double the price a week ago and five times 
the price a  year earlier.

As you are aware, Enron utilizes temporary staffing services to satisfy=20
staffing requirements throughout the company.  For the past several months,=
 a=20
project team, representing Enron=01,s temporary staffing users, have resear=
ched=20
and evaluated alternative Managed Services programs to determine which sour=
ce=20
would best meet our current and future needs in terms of quality, performan=
ce=20
and cost containment objectives.  The Business Unit Implementation Project=
=20
Team members are:=20

Laurie Koenig, Operations Management, EES
Carolyn Vigne, Administration, EE&CC
Linda Martin, Accounting & Accounts Payable, Corporate
Beverly Stephens, Administration, ENA
Norma Hasenjager, Human Resources, ET&S
Peggy McCurley, Administration, Networks
Jane Ellen Weaver, Enron Broadband Services
Paulette Obrecht, Legal, Corporate
George Weber, GSS

In addition, Eric Merten (EBS), Kathy Cook (EE&CC), Carolyn Gilley (ENA),=
=20
Larry Dallman (Corp/AP), and Diane Eckels (GSS) were active members of the=
=20
Selection Project Team.

As a result of the team=01,s efforts, we are pleased to announce the beginn=
ing=20
of a strategic alliance with CORESTAFF=01,s Managed Services Group.  This g=
roup=20
will function as a vendor-neutral management entity overseeing all staffing=
=20
vendors in the program scope. They will also provide a web based online=20
technology tool that will enhance the ordering and reporting capabilities. =
=20
The goal of our alliance with CORESTAFF is to make obtaining a temporary=20
worker with the right skills and experience easier while protecting the bes=
t=20
interests of the organization.=20

We plan to implement Phase I of this improvement effective January 2, 2001.=
 =20
This Phase I of the implementation will encompass administrative/clerical=
=20
temporary workers at the Houston locations only. If you currently have=20
administrative/clerical temporary workers in your department, the enhanceme=
nt=20
will not affect their position. In an effort to preserve relationships, all=
=20
current staffing vendors will be invited to participate in this enhanced=20
program.  CORESTAFF shares our commitment to minimize any disruptions in=20
service during this transition.=20
=20
We expect to incorporate the administrative/clerical workers in Omaha,=20
Seattle and Portland in Phase II, which is scheduled for February, 2001.  T=
he=20
scope and timing of any additional phases will be determined after these tw=
o=20
phases have been completed.

Realizing the impact that the temporary workforce has in business today, we=
=20
selected CORESTAFF=01,s Managed Services Group based on their exceptional=
=20
management team, commitment to quality service, and creative solutions to o=
ur=20
staffing needs.  The relationship promises to offer Enron a cost effective=
=20
and simple means for obtaining temporary employees.

In the coming weeks, Enron and CORESTAFF=01,s Managed Services Group will b=
e=20
communicating to Enron=01,s administrative/clerical temporary staffing vend=
ors=20
about the new process. =20

There are many benefits to this new Managed Services program, which are=20
outlined on the attached page.  More details on how to utilize CORESTAFF=01=
,s=20
Managed Services program will be announced soon and meetings will be=20
scheduled to demonstrate the reporting system and to meet the Managed=20
Services team.

What is Managed Services?

CORESTAFF=01,s Managed Services program includes:

? Vendor-neutral management model
? Equal distribution of staffing orders to all staffing partners
? Web-based application with online ordering, data capture and customized=

The purpose of this message is to update employees on the
status of the California Attorney General's order regarding the preservation
of business information.  Please NOTE THE IMPORTANT POLICIES DESCRIBED
BELOW.

We have negotiated procedures with the
California Attorney General's office allowing each of you to manage your
email and hard drive capacity while still preserving business information.


Starting today, please implement the
following business information retention policies:

(1) PERSONAL EMAIL: can be kept, discarded,
etc. at will.

(2) BUSINESS EMAIL: do not delete any
business email sent or received for 24 hours.  This 24 hour delay will allow
the network to save a backup copy of the email.  After 24 hours, BUSINESS
EMAIL may be kept, discarded, etc. at will.

(3) WORD PROCESSING FILES OR FILE FRAGMENTS:
do not delete any SAVED FILE or any FILE FRAGMENT.  This policy covers any
FILE or FILE FRAGMENT that you have saved on your hard disk or the network.

(4) DATABASES: do not delete any information
in DATABASES.

(5) EXCEL SPREADSHEETS: do not delete any
information in EXCEL SPREADSHEETS.

(6) CALENDARS OR SCHEDULING PROGRAMS: do not
delete any information.

(7) OTHER ELECTRONIC DATA: do not delete any
OTHER ELECTRONIC DATA.

(8) HARD DRIVE CAPACITY: in the event that
you run out of disk space on your personal computer, you may copy files to
the network (where they will be backed up), then delete the files from your
personal computer to create the work space you need.  DO NOT DELETE ANY FILE
BEFORE YOU HAVE COPIED IT TO THE NETWORK.


In our negotiations we have discovered no
reason to believe that Enron has been singled out for investigation by the
Attorney General.  We will update you as we learn more.

Please respond promptly to this notice via
email an e-mail to me.  Your email should state that you understand and 
intend to comply
with the important business information retention policies stated above.

Thanks for your help in this matter.

Tim Belden

Enron Benefit Plans 
Summary Annual Report    

The basic financial and insurance information on the back of this page, as 
well as the material below, provide a Summary Annual Report for the Enron 
Benefit Plans.  The annual report for each plan has been filed with the 
Internal Revenue Service, as required by the Employee Retirement Income 
Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). 

NOTE:  You may receive a report for a benefit plan in which you are not a 
participant or under which you are not entitled.  Entitlement to benefits 
under any of the plans is based on the provisions of each plan.


Your Rights to Additional Information

You have the right to receive, upon request, a copy of the full annual 
report, or any part thereof, for any plan.  For insured plans, insurance 
information (including any sales commissions paid by insurance carriers) is 
shown in the annual reports.

To obtain a copy of the full annual report, or any part thereof, for any 
plan, write or call:

Enron Corp
1400 Smith Street
Houston, TX  77002-7311

(713) 853-6161

You also have the right to receive from the plan administrator, on request 
and at no charge, a statement of the assets and liabilities of the plan and 
accompanying notes, or a statement of income and expenses of the plan and 
accompanying notes, or both.  If you request a copy of the full annual report 
from the plan administrator, these two statements and accompanying notes will 
be included as part of that report.

You also have the legally protected right to examine the annual report at the 
main office of the plan (Enron Corp., 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX  
77002-7311) and at the U.S. Department of Labor in Washington, D.C., or to 
obtain a copy from the U.S. Department of Labor upon payment of copying 
costs.  Requests to the Department should be addressed to:  Public Disclosure 
Room, N-5638, Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration, U.S. Department of 
Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20210.

This is the preliminary report for December 2000.  Fortunately, you have seen 
most of the information during the month because the overlays on name changes 
were reported as they occurred.  The additions, that were not previously 
reported, are highlighted.





The ERMS short name changes will be made on Monday, December 18, after 1:p, 
CST.  Please note that the short name for American Public Energy Agency, CP 
ID 51134, will also be changed as indicated.  This was a name overlay on the 
Nov. 2000 report (see bottom tab on the spreadsheet).   It will change from 
ENERGYAME to AMERPUBENE.

Records will be inactivated on Jan 1, 2001.



HAPPY HOLIDAYS!

It is with mixed emotions that I announce my plans to retire from Enron 
effective 1 February 2001.  On the one hand, I will look forward to the 
adventures that retirement offers; but on the other, I will miss working with 
those of you whom I have come to know over the years.  I thoroughly enjoyed 
my ten years with Enron, and it has been a privilege to lead EECC.  I wish 
all of you and Enron the very best and continued success.

We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change=
s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=
=20
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit=
y=20
for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=
orth=20
America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=
=20
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=
he=20
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=
=20
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=
=20
will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =
of=20
the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=
ness=20
into Enron Global Assets in the near future.
=20
Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined=
=20
EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi=
ll=20
focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to=
=20
the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE=
S=20
to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or=
der=20
to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20
facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for=
=20
at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout=
h=20
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=
=20
businesses and the commercial support functions:

Enron Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=
 and=20
CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20

Enron Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for=
=20
operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20
marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=
t=20
into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility=
=20
for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20
Americas.

Enron Europe
The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust=
ralia=20
and Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=
=20
Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.

Enron Global Markets
Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=
=20
CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20
responsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20
exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20
associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to=
=20
Enron Global Assets.  Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the=
=20
commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20
equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM=
ahon,=20
President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=
y,=20
the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in=
=20
the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=
=20
efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=
=20
EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These=
=20
newly defined roles are as follows:

Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=
e=20
Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works,=
=20
with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20
President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat=
ed=20
services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these=
=20
services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=
=20
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=
=20
for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.
Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.
Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =
on a=20
regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in=
=20
the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all=
=20
European and Eastern Hemisphere operations.  Rick and Mark will also contin=
ue=20
to support all other Enron businesses operating in their respective regions=
=20
and will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chi=
ef=20
of Staff.
Public Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a region=
al=20
basis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity,=20
Enron Net Works, and Enron Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue=
=20
in her role for Enron Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble=
r=20
will have responsibility for activity outside North America and Europe as=
=20
well as providing support for Enron Global Markets and Enron Global Assets.=
 =20
These individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship=
=20
to Mark Palmer, Vice President of Communications.
Business Analysis and Reporting =01) Wes Colwell will expand his role to co=
ver=20
EWS reporting in addition to his current role in North America.

Attached for your review is an organization chart for Enron Wholesale=20
Services which summarizes the changes described here.  As this organization=
=20
continues to evolve we will keep you informed of any additional changes.

ENRON GLOBAL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION
AND ENRON WIND

 As part of our company-wide initiative to examine our assets and investmen=
ts=20
around the world, we are considering a variety of options with respect to=
=20
EGEP and EWC.  As a consequence, we are putting these businesses under Clif=
f=20
Baxter=01,s direction.  Jeff Sherrick, CEO of EGEP, and Jim Noles, CEO of E=
nron=20
Wind, will report to Cliff.

CORPORATE STAFF

 We are consolidating the corporate staff functions: Human Resources,=20
Government Affairs, Public Relations/Communications and Administration.  In=
=20
that regard, Cindy Olson, Executive Vice President of Human Resources and=
=20
Community Relations, will report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President an=
d=20
Chief of Staff.

COMMITTEE STRUCTURE

 In light of the increased leadership opportunities created by Enron=01,s=
=20
growth, the Executive Committee will be expanded to include more of our=20
business unit leaders.  The primary role of this committee will continue to=
=20
be the communication of relevant information across Enron=01,s businesses a=
nd=20
the coordination of activities across those businesses.  We will also be=20
drawing on this group to lead company-wide initiatives such as the=20
performance review process and evaluation and creation of new businesses. =
=20
The Executive Committee membership is shown on the attached list.

 We are also forming a new committee =01) the Enron Corporate Policy Commit=
tee. =20
This group will be responsible for overall corporate policy, personnel=20
management policy and corporate strategy.  The Enron Corporate Policy=20
Committee membership is also shown on the attached list.

 We are confident that these changes will align our talent and our capital =
to=20
our highest return opportunities.  Please join us in congratulating and=20
supporting all of these individuals in their new roles.

On Saturday, January 13, 2001, an earthquake shook Central America.  The 
earthquake, which had a magnitude of 7.6, was centered off of El Salvador's 
central coast.  The death toll is currently at 700, and the damage has been 
estimated at nearly $1 billion, nearly half of the country's annual budget.  

Enron employees are encouraged to donate to relief efforts and to take 
advantage of our Matching Gift Program to double the impact of your 
donation.  Enron will match, dollar for dollar, every donation that you make, 
up to $15,000 annually per employee.  Listed below are a multitude of 
organizations that are offering aid to the victims of this earthquake.  To 
print a Matching Gift form, please click here and then click on gifts, grants 
and giving.  Please fill out the form and send it with your check to

for the same amount, to each of the organizations.  Please make sure to write 
"El Salvador" on your check.

Meet the head of the leading firm in our business.

Imagine the opportunity!

Imagine that the leading energy company in the world has picked you to run 
the  company that it expects to be the leading retail energy company in North 
America.

So you get a sharp competitive edge in the back room, you recruit IBM as a 
co-owner assuring you the lowest cost per customer by a factor of two or 
three.

To get your foot in 27 million doors you recruit AOL as a co-venturer with a 
commitment from AOL to promote NewPower's wares.  You do an IPO and take in 
about $700 million for working capital.  The IPO is over and the quiet period 
it required.  But the most important silver spoon -- so that you get your 
energy at the best price and to protect you against price spikes -- you get 
up front 30 Enron-trained   risk managers and traders.  Can you imagine 
having to recruit them?

To make sure this team is run by the optimum chief they picked Eugene 
Lockhart,  most recently president of Consumer Services at AT&T and before 
that president of BankAmerica's Global Retail Bank with its consumer, 
commercial and small business banking services delivered through 3,000+ 
branches.

Now, Lockhart's talking about his plans.

Restructuring Today had lunch with Lockhart Thursday and reported in detail 
(to read the full story see attachment):

? How NewPower intends to actually start up the retail industry?  What is the 
heart of NewPower's business plan?
? How they'll make money in markets where margins may seem too thin.
? How he's going to have 600,000+ customers next month and easily a million 
by the end of 2001.
? What percentage of their sales come from the NewPower website.  What figure 
is he using for cost of customer acquisition?
? Lockhart plans to have by the end of the first quarter or at the latest the 
second quarter 750,000 customers making them by far the largest unregulated 
retail  marketer in the US.
? How does he think utilities will compete with the NewPower paradigm?
? What marketshare do they expect to get at first and then by 2005?
? What does he see as his biggest challenge?
? Why is this a good time for NewPower to invade California markets?
? Why will NewPower succeed where Enron failed?
? What's the role of backward dating in forward market margins?
? Where NewPower gives a 20-25% discount on the commodity portion of a bill, 
what kind of margin can it make now?
? How do higher prices help NewPower?  "We're actually in a very good 
position given (that) the gas cost increases perversely will work in our 
favor ... "
? "We have a 10-year, exclusive agreement with IBM whereby we can issue a 
bill, collect the money and care for a customer at lower cost than anyone 
else in the industry by several orders of magnitude."

Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total 
car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing 
provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value 
proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first 
choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract 
reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and 
low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, 
where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or 
Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate 
selected: 
1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or 
Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for 
any damage to it. 
2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. 
For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 
per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following 
contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded 
on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)
To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's 
preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in 
National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club 
membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the 
transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid 
return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron 
travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron 
American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on 
the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact Jeff Leath at 
713-646-6165.

FYI....

EnTelligence?
No, its not spelled wrong, it's the name of a prospecting website designed =
to=20
deliver market information on existing and potential customers to commercia=
l=20
trading, mid-marketing, and origination teams.  It also delivers management=
=20
reports to analyze Enron=01,s position within the key industries that we se=
rve. =20
Presently, commercial groups have multiple methods for acquiring potential=
=20
customer information.  This system will standardize their resource tools an=
d=20
add consistency to their prospecting processes.  EnTelligence combines=20
information from internal databases such as Global Counterparty, Credit=20
Aggregation System (CAS), Sitara, Enpower, and ERMS with information from=
=20
external data sources such as Dun & Bradstreet and I.H.S Energy Reporter to=
=20
identify customer prospects.  By providing the capability to filter and=20
search by region, industry, company size, or energy consumption levels, the=
=20
prospecting process is shortened and the identification of strong prospects=
=20
improved. Available reports include Market Penetration, Industry Prospectin=
g,=20
Comparison Prospecting, Company Profiles, Family Tree, Top Customers, and=
=20
Inactive Accounts.  Currently only Natural Gas and Power physical deals are=
=20
loaded, but financial deals will be included soon, as well as other=20
commodities. =20

Alternatively, you can also access the site from Enron's homepage, under th=
e=20
Information & Services section, go to the link called "EnTelligence".

To view deal data, a user will need to submit an eRequest and select either=
:=20
Trader, Manager, or Sr Manager security.  I would also recommend to add the=
=20
following applications to your eRequest: Dow Jones Interactive (DJI), and=

Live Link.  DJI is to be able to view market information and Live Link is o=
ur=20
desktop documentation system which enables the user to view a contract from=

Welcome to the Official PGE PARK NEWSLETTER.  This newsletter has been
created by Portland Family Entertainment (PFE) to give you an insider's
view on PGE PARK, the home of the Triple A Baseball Portland Beavers and
A-League Soccer Portland Timbers.

For more information, please visit our web site at www.pgepark.com, or
call the Ticket Hotline at (503) 553-5555.

PGE PARK CONSTRUCTION OVERVIEW
When PGE Park is completed next spring, event patrons may be surprised
to see the magnitude of this exciting renovation.  In partnership with
the City of Portland, PFE will manage a $38.5 million renovation of the
former Civic Stadium to enhance fan enjoyment standards, meet modern
design codes and honor the historic character of this 1926 landmark.

Soon to be the premier outdoor event venue in the region, PGE Park will
feature:

*  New convertible playing surface, adaptable to all events.

*  New baseball dugouts and bullpens.

*  Major League Baseball field dimensions.

*  Vintage style wrought-iron fence along 18th Ave. allowing passerby a
view of all PGE Park events.

*  New seats and wider concourses.

*  New restrooms and baby-changing stations.

*  New concession stands and kiosks with improved menu options.

*  Fred Meyer Family Deck featuring an old-fashioned soda fountain.

*  Yet-to-be-named Widmer field level bar and grill, featuring grills
and full beverage service.

*  Affordable Pavilion Boxes, Field Boxes and Club Seats for
high-quality corporate entertainment.

*  State-of-the-art sound system and new theatre organ.

*  Americans with Disabilities (ADA) Compliance.

*  Current seismic code compliance.

*  ... and much more!

PGE PARK CONSTRUCTION UPDATE
Virtually every area of the construction site is currently under
construction.  From elevator pits and structural elements to field boxes
and underground utilities, it's all coming together for our Spring 2001
opening.

The main concourse along 20th Avenue (the first base side), demolished
during the Portland Rockies' season last summer, is re-emerging as a
wider, lowered concourse.  Steel beams and metal decking are being
placed for a major concrete pour in the near future.  This will be the
most visible reconstruction element to date in the project.

Concrete has already been poured at the field level in the area of the
new soon-to-be-named Widmer Bar and Grill.  This field-level area will
have both an open air patio and a space built under the seating bowl for
a true early 1920's bar feel.  Selecting your favorite bar stool for a
view of the game is only a few months away!

We will soon be adding a Construction Update Photo Gallery to
www.pgepark.com.  We will keep you posted on when this exciting feature
is added.  If you would like to receive photos as an attachment, please
email us at info@pgepark.com.


PFE NAMES TRIPLE-A AND SINGLE-A BASEBALL TEAMS
After an outpouring of fan feedback, Portland Family Entertainment went
with tradition when they announced that the Triple-A Baseball Pacific
Coast League club will be called the Portland Beavers.

"Baseball is a game deeply rooted in tradition," said Mike Higgins, PFE
vice president and Beavers general manager, who made the announcement.
"The name and logo will also integrate well with the nostalgic look and
feel that PGE Park will have when it opens next spring."

Portland Family Entertainment also announced that it has named its
Northwest League Single-A Baseball Team the Tri-City Dust Devils.
Formerly the Portland Rockies, the Dust Devils will begin play in the
Tri-Cities Stadium in Pasco beginning summer 2001.

PFE partnered with the Marathon Media Group of Tri-Cities to conduct a
poll and contest of their radio listeners to select the team name.
Respondents were able to vote on the Marathon Media web site.
Richland's Rosalie Swanson was selected at random, from the many Dust
Devil entries, as the grand prizewinner of two club-level season tickets
for the team's inaugural season.

For information on Beavers Club Seats and Season Tickets, call
503.553.5555 or fill out our online questionnaire at
http://www.pgepark.com/old_site/infoform.html.


VANCOUVER'S RICK SWEET NAMED BEAVERS MANAGER
The San Diego Padres didn't have to search far to find the right guy for
the job as today Vancouver, Washington resident, Rick Sweet, was named
manager of the Pacific Coast League's Portland Beavers.  The Padres also
announced other additions to the Beavers staff including Darrel
Akerfelds as pitching coach; Roy Howell as coach, and John Maxwell as
the club's trainer.

"We felt it was important to hire a manager that had significant
managerial experience," said Tye Waller, Padres' director, player
development.  "It was also important for us to hire someone who had ties
to the local community.  That's not always an easy combination to come
up with, but we clearly achieved that in hiring Rick.  Rick, Darrel and
Roy have all played in the big leagues and that experience will be a
tremendous asset in the development of our younger players.  In John we
have a first class trainer and will do a terrific job in looking after
our guys."

Sweet has 12 seasons of experience as a minor league manager and was
named Pacific Coast League manager of the year in 1994, while managing
the Tucson Toros as they defeated the Portland Beavers for the PCL
championship.  He joins the Portland's new Triple-A team from the
Montreal Expos where he served as their minor league field coordinator
for the past two years.  During the 1998 season, Sweet managed the
Double-A Harrisburg Senators to the Eastern League title.

Sweet also reached the majors as a switch-hitting catcher with the Mets,
Seattle Mariners and Padres.  He made his major league debut on April 8,
1978 with the Padres.  Sweet homered in his first Kingdome at-bat after
joining Seattle in 1982.


CONWAY NAMED TIMBERS ASSISTANT COACH
The Portland Timbers have named former player, captain, and coach, Jimmy
Conway, as assistant coach for Portland's new A-League soccer club.
Through an agreement between the Timbers and Oregon Youth Soccer
Association (OYSA), Conway will continue to serve in his current role as
OYSA's director of coaching, a position he has held since 1982.

"Jimmy was my first choice for the position of assistant coach and I am
delighted that he was available to join our staff," said Timbers head
coach, Bobby Howe.  "Not only is he an outstanding member of US Soccer's
National Coaching Staff, but he also has a first class international
playing background.  I also want to recognize and thank OYSA for their
spirit of cooperation in allowing us to 'share' with them Jimmy's
knowledge and experience.  I think it will be a great benefit for our
professional players and Oregon's youth soccer players."

Prior to coaching, Conway had an outstanding playing career making 20
caps for the Republic of Ireland from 1966-1977.  As a midfielder,
Conway made over 300 appearances for Fulham in England's First Division,
where he scored 66 goals for the Cottagers.  In 1976, he transferred to
Manchester City of the English Premier League before joining the Timbers
in 1978.  He was named captain of the Timbers in 1979 and was promoted
to the position of player-coach in 1980 by then head coach, Don Megson.
He retired from playing professionally in 1982.


TIMBERS ADD SECOND TRYOUT DATE TO MEET DEMAND
The Portland Timbers announced today that they have reached capacity for
their first public tryout scheduled for Saturday, November 11 at Tigard
High School and will add a second public tryout in January to meet
demand.

The exact date, location, and other details for the Timbers second
tryout will be announced in December.  The November 11 Timbers Open
Tryout will feature players from the local market as well as New York,
Texas, Illinois, New Jersey, Minnesota, Iowa, California and Alabama.

The Timbers 28-game regular season will kick-off in late April 2001 and

Easy as 1-2-3
1.   Fill out a form and attach it to each item you need shipped.   
2.   Place item in top black tray.....put oversize items on floor between 
Erin and Emily's desks.

For your information--

Eric Thode, the Director of Public Relations for Enron, sent the email below 
to let us know that after a lot of discussion with the legal department, the 
decision was made to retain our company name of Enron North America, while 
the offices of Dave Delainey and John Lavorato will use Enron Americas.  Eric 
suggested that if we have ordered any business cards or stationery with Enron 
Americas that we re-order and use Enron North America.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

Debra --

Stop the presses....I just received new information regarding the name 
change.  We have decided to keep everyone as Enron NOrth America or Enron 
South America.  The only people who will use Enron Americas are Dave Delainey 
and John Lavorato.  Hope this does not cause a problem.  If it does, please 
call me to discuss.  I'm sorry for the incorrect information a week or so ago.

Eric

EnTelligence?
No, its not spelled wrong, it's the name of a prospecting website in ENA=20

NEWS FROM THE GLOBALFLASH

Enron Direct

improving all aspects of its customer service - even while enjoying continu=

In the last week, five new ideas have been posted to the Idea Vault and 
routed for review, including Enron Airline Services, the Enron Office Locator 
and the use of geostationary satellites to read meters.  
We also have a success story to share.  Tony Pickett suggested that Enron 
compile a glossary of terms (abbreviations, acronyms and industry jargon) and 
make it available online.  The New Hire Network has stepped up to make this 
idea a reality.
Visit the ThinkBank today and drop an idea in the Idea Vault!


This week, we are releasing a new version of eSpeak!  From the audience 
perspective, the changes are very subtle.  We've added features such as a 
time stamp on each posting, the ability to format responses, and we've even 
put the speaker's photo inside the transcript window (in case you forget 
who's hosting the event).  From eSpeak's perspective, we've smoothed out some 
things  behind the scenes.  We hope you'll take a look at the new site and 
let us know what you think about it.  
The next eSpeak will take place on Thursday, Mar. 29 at 10 a.m. Houston 
time.  Mark Koenig, executive VP of Investor Relations, will discuss Enron's 
investor relations function and provide a stock update.

 

Hey, check out this cool, stainless steel mug!	It's almost as cool as this mouse 
pad!

	
	

Both the mug and the mouse pad are available at the Signature Shop online, 
with lots of other really neat eThink stuff.  Buy some today!

Wednesday, April 11 at 10 a.m. Houston time, join Gene Lockhart, president & 
CEO of The NewPower Company on eSpeak.  Gene will answer your questions about 
electric restructuring in Texas.
Can't make it then?  Not to worry:  You can submit a question right now!  Go 
to the eSpeak site and post your question in Gene's event.  He will respond 
to it during the live event, and you can read the transcript later for all 
the answers.


Here is an eMeet game that everyone can play!  Suppose your group is under an 
evil spell cast by a witch.  Who is the witch, what is the spell and what 
words were uttered to cast it?  Sound absurd?  It really isn't.  Going 
through this thought process might help you "exorcise" problems in the 
workplace.  Share your evil spells on eMeet in the "What's your evil spell?" 
category.


By now, most of you have gotten the message that it's time to cut costs at 
Enron.  Do you have a simple suggestion for how we might do this?  Post it in 
the Idea Vault in the new category:  Cost Reduction.  ThinkBank.  Make a 
deposit today.

Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total 
car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing 
provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value 
proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first 
choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract 
reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and 
low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, 
where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or 
Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate 
selected: 
1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or 
Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for 
any damage to it. 
2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. 
For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 
per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following 
contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded 
on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)

To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's 
preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in 
National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club 
membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the 
transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid 
return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron 
travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron 
American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on 
the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact Jeff Leath at 
713-646-6165.

Subject: Re-Alignment

Thanks to all of you, Enron North America has had an outstanding year in=20
2000.  Some of the more notable accomplishments include:
a) 100% plus increase in EBIT from 1999 actuals to 2000 forecast;
b) significant rationalization of the balance sheet including the sale of t=
he=20
(i) Wind River/Powder River gathering assets, (ii) East Coast Power=20
generating assets, (iii) HPL and (iv) five of the six Eastern Peakers;
c) ENA is the leading energy merchant by a factor of two;
d) physical electricity volume grew by 34% YTD 1999 to YTD 2000 forecast;
e) natural gas volumes grew by 82% YTD 1999 to YTD 2000 forecast;
f) 500% growth in daily transactions from November 1999 to November 2000 du=
e=20
to the highly successful Enron OnLine distribution channel; and
g) ENA reaching its 25% ROCE target.

These are truly outstanding accomplishments and our expectations for growth=
=20
and opportunity in Enron North America for 2001 are consistent with that=20
success.  In order to reach these goals, we felt it necessary to re-align a=
=20
number of our organizations. A number of these changes are completed.  The=
=20
goals of such re-alignment include:
a) increase overall productivity with the goal to ensure that every employe=
e=20
is in a position to contribute regardless of skill set;
b) increase overall market coverage, deal flow and information generation=
=20
with the goal to increase bid/offer income, increase the velocity of deal=
=20
flow, improve customer coverage and promote quality information transfer to=
=20
our trading organization;
c) increase deal quality and earnings quality with the goal to (i) allocate=
=20
our resources towards the best transactions and (ii) significantly increase=
=20
our =01&mid-market=018 originated transactions in our portfolio;
d) promote real time decision making and a closer tie between our trading a=
nd=20
origination (mid-market and structured) organizations in order to better=20
align those functions to reduce the amount of un-productive internal focus;
e) increase the overall velocity of the capital being utilized consistent=
=20
with our goal of a 25% plus return on capital employed; and
f) identify and recognize a host of new leaders in the organization that ar=
e=20
critical to meeting our goals next year.

With these objectives in mind, patterned after the successful business mode=
ls=20
in Calgary and Portland, effective immediately the following changes are=20
being implemented:
a) East Power =01) a single East Power Team incorporating trading, mid-mark=

Janet Dietrich who will report to the Enron Americas - Office of the Chairm=

Both Rob and Max will continue to report to the EA OOC.
d) U.S. Natural Gas =01) there are several changes anticipated in this busi=

consistent with the goals and objectives described above. The changes=20
primarily affect the East, Central, West and Texas gas regions. Each region=

will consist of a single gas team incorporating trading, mid-market and=20

responsible for covering the LDC=01,s, muni=01,s/co-ops, industrials, IOU=

and the producers.  There will be an increasing focus on the upstream side =
of=20

addition to market area opportunities. The team will utilize all of ENA=01,=

these groups will report directly to the EA OOC;
East Gas =01) a single East Gas Team incorporating trading, mid-market and=

West Gas  =01) in a similar manner, a West Gas Team will be formed co-manag=

Phillip Allen and Barry Tycholiz, who will be joining us in Houston from th=

Canadian team. The Denver office under Mark Whitt will be integrated under=
=20
this team.
Central Gas =01)  in a similar manner, a Central Gas Team will be formed=20
co-managed by Hunter Shively and Laura Luce. The Chicago office will be=20
integrated into this team.
Texas Gas =01) the Texas Gas Team will be managed by Tom Martin. This team =
will=20
continue to manage the gas trading business around HPL until the pending sa=
le=20
is concluded in Q2 2001.  After the sale of HPL, this team will build a Tex=
as=20
gas business without ownership of the HPL assets. =20
Financial =01) this group will continue to be managed by John Arnold with n=
o=20
significant changes.
Derivatives =01) this group, lead by Fred Lagrasta, will offer derivative a=
nd=20
financial mid-market products and services to the natural gas market=20
specifically targeting CFO=01,s and treasury departments.  Fred will contin=
ue to=20
maintain certain existing mid-market accounts with a number of producer and=
=20
industrial accounts where relationships are well formed. Otherwise,=20
mid-market coverage will gravitate to the regions. The New York office gas=
=20
marketing efforts will continue to be managed by Fred.
Upstream Products =01) this group, lead by Jean Mrha, will develop several=
=20
distinct product offerings for the upstream segment of the gas market.  Thi=
s=20
group will develop and market the product in conjunction with the regions.=
=20
This is consistent with our desire to have a broader product offering and=
=20
greater market penetration in the upstream segment.  These products include=
=20
producer outsourcing, similar to our successful Petro-Canada and Suncor=20
relationships in Canada, physical storage re-engineering, compressor=20
services, wellhead liquidity products and offshore asset and capital=20
products.  In addition, Jean will manage our Bridgeline joint venture with=
=20
Texaco. =20
Gas Structuring =01) this group will be lead by Ed McMichael, reporting to =
Frank=20
Vickers, will provide structuring and deal support to all the gas teams.
Gas Fundamentals =01) this group will be lead by Chris Gaskill, reporting t=
o=20
Hunter Shively, will provide fundamentals to all the gas teams.   =20

Julie Gomez will continue to support the gas floor through several identifi=
ed=20
projects including long-term supply/demand analysis and, natural gas=20
transportation capacity trading opportunities.
=20
There is an expectation of some customer overlap between the gas and power=
=20
groups; for example, the combination utilities and the IPP=01,s.  The teams=
 will=20
coordinate with regard to the combination utilities like Con. Edison or=20
PG&E.  With regard to the IPP=01,s, to the extent that the product offering=
=20
involves an underlying power position, the power teams will manage. We have=
=20
asked Janet Dietrich to coordinate such overlaps between the two=20
organizations in Houston.=20

e) Technical/Restructuring - In the effort to consolidate and centralize ou=
r=20
technical resources (engineering, development, operations, pipeline) to=20
ensure that this skill base is available to all ENA groups and utilized=20
productively across the organization, Brian Redmond will form and manage th=
e=20
Technical Services Group.  This group will manage ENA=01,s technical risks =
and=20
will provide, on a cost basis, technical services for the entire ENA=20
organization. This group will manage the interface with EE&CC and OEC.  In=
=20
addition, the Restructuring Group, currently managed by Dick Lydecker, will=
=20
report to Brian Redmond.  This group is currently monetizing a large portio=
n=20
of the merchant investment portfolio given our current strategies.  This=20
group will have continuing responsibility to manage troubled commodity and=
=20
capital transactions that need considerable time and attention to manage ri=
sk=20
and monetize.=20

In addition to these responsibilities, Brian will manage the pending sale a=
nd=20
transition of the HPL asset over the next couple quarters as regulatory and=
=20
securities approvals are obtained in order to complete the sale.  Brian wil=
l=20
report to the EA OOC.

f) Principal Investing  =01)  with the departure of Jeff Donahue to new=20
opportunities in EBS, ENA=01,s venture capital function will be managed by=
=20
Michael L. Miller.  This group makes small investments in distributed=20
generation, power quality and technology companies that can benefit from=20
Enron=01,s distribution channels and expertise.  Michael will report to the=
 EA=20
OOC.

g) Corporate Development =01) Tim Detmering will assume the corporate=20
development responsibilities for ENA as Jeff transitions to his new role an=
d=20
will report to the EA OOC.

h) Generation Investments =01) there will be no changes to this group manag=
ed by=20
Dave Duran. Dave will continue to report to the EA OOC.

i) Energy Capital Resources =01) there will be no changes to this group=20
currently lead by C. John Thompson and Scott Josey.  John and Scott will=20
continue to report to the EA OOC.

As a final note in the interest of keeping things simple, Enron Americas wi=
ll=20
have two operating divisions  - Enron North America and Enron South America=
. =20
As a result, we will continue to conduct business under these two operating=
=20
companies; therefore, eliminating the need to change legal entities et al. =
=20
If you are currently a commercial employee of ENA or ESA you will continue =
to=20
conduct business in that company.=20

We look forward to another exciting year in the North American energy=20
market.  This is certainly a company unrivaled in the marketplace with the=
=20
most talented employees.  The opportunities are endless.  We wish you and=
=20
your family a very happy and safe holiday season.
