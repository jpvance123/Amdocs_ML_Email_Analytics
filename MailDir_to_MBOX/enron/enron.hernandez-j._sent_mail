Good morning my friends.  I probably sent this to some of you before, but I 
ran into it again, and made me feel so good, that I felt like sharing it with 
all of you again.  Hope you can open it and enjoy it, as much as I did.

Love you all.

Subject: Fwd: A Child's Question



Once upon a time there was a child ready to be born.   The child asked God, 
"They tell me you are sending me to earth tomorrow, but I am so small and 
helpless, how will I be able to live there?"   God replied, "Among my many 
angels, the one I have chose for you will be waiting for you and take care of 
you."

The child further inquired, "Here in heaven all I have to do is sing and 
smile to be happy, what happens when I go to earth?"   God said, "Your angel 
will sing for you and smile for you every day. You will feel your angel's 
love and be very happy."

Again the child asked, "I don't know the language, how will I understand when 
people talk to me?"   God said, "Your angel will tell you the most beautiful 
and sweet words you will ever hear and with much patience and care, teach you 
how to speak."

"And what am I going to do when I want to talk to you?"   God said, "Your 
angel will place your hands together and teach you how to pray."

"I've heard there are bad men on Earth, who will protect me?"  God said, 
"Your angel will defend you, and even risk its life for you."

"I will not see you anymore, and I will be sad."    God said "Your angel will 
talk to you about me and teach you the way to come back to me.  I will always 
be next to you."

At that moment there was much peace in heaven, but voices from Earth could be 
heard, and the child hurriedly asked, "God, it's time for me to leave now, 
will you please tell me my angel's name?"    God replied, "Her name is not 
important, you will simply call her Mom."

Hi everyone, a good friend sent this to me today, and
I wanted to share it with all of you.  Have a great
semester!!

Maria


 Friend



When you receive this, say a prayer.  That's all you
have to do.  There
is
nothing attached.  This is powerful.  Just send this
to four people and
do
not break this, please.  Prayer is one of the best
free gifts we
receive.
There is no cost but a lot of rewards. Let's continue
praying for one
another.

Father, I ask you to bless my friends reading this
right now Lord, show
them

a new revelation of Your love and power.  Holy Spirit,
I ask You to
minister

to their spirit at this very moment.  Where there is
pain, give them
Your
peace and Mercy.  Where there is self-doubting,
release a renewed
confidence

in Your ability to work through them.  Where there is
tiredness, or
exhaustion, I ask You to give them understanding,
patience, and
strength as
they learn submission to Your leading.  Where there is
spiritual
stagnation,

I ask You to renew them by revealing Your nearness,
and by drawing them
into

greater intimacy with You.  Where there is fear,
reveal Your love, and
release to them Your courage.  Where there is a sin
blocking them,
reveal
it, and break its hold over my friend's life.  Bless
their finances,
give
them greater vision, and raise up leaders, and friends
to support, and
encourage them.  Give each of them discernment to
recognize the demonic
forces around them, and reveal to them the power they
have in You to
defeat
it.  I ask You to do these things in Jesus' name.

In Christian love,
Your Friend in Jesus.

Passing this on to anyone you consider a friend will
bless you both.
Passing this on to one not considered a friend is
something I know
Christ
would do.

SERC-  Soco a mid 20's to low 30's bid through the afternoon peak.  They did 
not show an offer, other than quoting CT's.  They bought from their 
neighbors.  Duke was a seller most of the day in the mid 30's to mid 40's.  
OPC's bid never got higher than a mid 30's.  They also bought from DUKE.  
Vepco offered out in the 40's to 50's.   SOCO, OPC  will be on the bid for 
Monday.  TVA was offered power in the mid 20's to mid 30's with no 
response(I'll take your number down).

FRCC- FPC was best bid buying up to $70.  We began selling to them HE 10 at 
$10 and walked them up to $70 (200mw's).  FPL showed very little interest in 
getting anything into them.  TECO got rain all day and did not show a bid.  
TAL also did not show a bid.  FPL and FPC will on the bid for hourly power on

Subject: A Man's Perspective


TO WOMEN EVERYWHERE FROM A MAN WHO'S HAD ENOUGH...

If you think you're fat, you probably are. Don't ask us. We refuse to
answer.

Learn to work the toilet seat. If it's up, put it down.

If you won't dress like the Victoria's Secret girls, don't expect us to act=
=20
like soap opera guys.

Don't cut your hair. Ever. Long hair is always more attractive than short=
=20
hair. One of the big reasons guys fear getting married is that married wome=
n=20
always cut their hair, and by then you're stuck with her.

Birthdays, Valentines, and Anniversaries are not quests to see if we can
find the perfect present yet again!

If you ask a question you don't want an answer to, expect an answer you
don't want to hear.

Sometimes, we're not thinking about you. Live with it. Don't ask us what
we're thinking about unless you are prepared to discuss such topics as
navel lint, the shotgun formation, or monster trucks.

Sunday =3D sports. It's like the full moon or the changing of the tides.
Let it be.

Shopping is not a sport, and no, we're never going to think of it that
way.

When we have to go somewhere, absolutely anything you wear is fine.
Really.

You have enough clothes.  You have too many shoes.

Crying is blackmail.

Ask for what you want. Let's be clear on this one: Subtle hints don't work.
Strong hints don't work. Really obvious hints don't work. Just say it!

No, we don't know what day it is. We never will. Mark anniversaries on
the calendar.

Peeing standing up is more difficult. We're bound to miss sometimes.

Most guys own three pairs of shoes-what makes you think we'd be any good
at choosing which pair, out of thirty, would look good with your dress?

Yes and No are perfectly acceptable answers to almost every question.

Come to us with a problem only if you want help solving it. That's what
we do. Sympathy is what your girlfriends are for.

A headache that lasts for 17 months is a problem. See a doctor.

Foreign films are best left to foreigners.

Check your oil.

It is neither in your best interest nor ours to take the quiz together.
No, it doesn't matter which quiz.

Anything we said 6 months ago is inadmissible in an argument. All comments
become null and void after 7 days.

If something we said can be interpreted two ways, and one of the ways
makes you sad or angry, we meant the other one.

Let us ogle. We're going to look anyway; it's genetic.

You can either tell us to do something OR tell us how to do something
but not both.

Whenever possible, please say whatever you have to say during
commercials..

ALL men see in only 16 colors. Peach is a fruit, not a color.

If it itches, it will be scratched.

Beer is as exciting for us as handbags are for you.

If we ask what's wrong and you say "nothing," we will act like nothing's=20
wrong. We know you're lying, but it's just not worth the hassle.

What the heck is a doily anyway?
=02=05---------------------------------------------------------------------=

para Blondi...errr  Charlie:

ogle:  mirar codiciosamente o insinuante
doily:  tapete

>GOD answered......"When I made woman, I decided she
>had to be special. I made her shoulders strong enough
>to carry the weight of the world, yet, made her arms
>gentle enough to give comfort...
>
>I gave her the inner strength to endure childbirth and
>the rejection that many times will come even from her
>own children.
>
>I gave her a hardness that allows her to keep going
>and take care of her family and friends, even when
>everyone else gives up, through sickness and fatigue,

>I gave her the sensitivity to love her children under
>any and all circumstances.  Even when her child has

>She has the very special power to make a child's

>
>I gave her wisdom to know that a good husband never

>her resolve to stand beside him, unfalteringly.

>For all of this hard work, I also gave her a tear to
>shed. It is hers to use whenever needed and it is her
>only weakness....

>When you see her cry, tell her how much you love her,

Juan,
Looking at my schedule, I could take off my days on Saturday the 21st and 
Sunday the 22nd and work days on Thurs & Fri the 26 & 27.  I can't take 
Monday the 23rd because there are only two of us on that night.  I would be 
very happy to make this change.  Please let me know ASAP if this is 
acceptable so I can make the appropriate plans.

Doug

OR IS IT FUNNY?




Funny how simple it is  for people to trash God ...
      and then wonder why the world's going to hell.

        Funny how we believe what the newspapers say,
       but question what the Bible says.

Funny how everyone wants to go to heaven
       provided they do not have to believe, think, say, or do anything the
Bible says.


Or is it scary?



       Funny how someone can say "I believe in God"
but still follow Satan (who, by the way, also "believes" in God).

 Funny how you can send a thousand  'jokes' through e-mail
and they spread like wildfire,
but when you start sending messages regarding the Lord,
people think twice about sharing.

       Funny how the lewd, crude, vulgar and obscene pass freely through
cyberspace,
but the public discussion of Jesus
is suppressed in the school and workplace.


Funny, isn't it?


Funny how someone can be so fired up for Christ on Sunday,
but be an invisible Christian the rest of the week.

Are you laughing?


Funny how when you go to  forward this  message,
      you will not send it to too many on your address list because you're
not
sure what they believe, or what they will think of you for sending it to
them.


Funny how I can be more worried about what other people
think of me than what God thinks of me.


       Are you thinking?

      I'm thinking and I have the courage to send this...do you?

SERC

A very quiet night in SERC.  Evening peak prices fell off hard due to rain 
covering  SOCO's control area.  OPC was the best bid for the evening peak he 
21-22($60-$70).  SOCO would not show a bid for the evening peak.  For he 
21-23 SOCO began to sell about 400mw's to SCEG, SC and GTC.  The TLR called 
by TVA on the Bowen-Sequoyah has not been re-called as of 3:00 a.m.  TVA has 
not been able to bring in power from the north.   TVA must be doing well 
generation wise since they did not import power from its neighbors.  For 
off-peak SOCO was $14 @ $22.  SCEG was a $15 bid.   For friday SOCO, OPC and 
SCEG will be on the bid.       

 SERC    16 hour average:  BID  $ 42.7  OFFER $ 72.5



FRCC

Importing power into Florida was again a problem up until off-peak.  For the 
evening peak FPL and FPC were bidding in the mid 40's.  For he 22 FPL bought 
$21 and for off-peak  FPL was a mid teens bid.   Both TEC and TAL were flat 
for the evening peak and the off-peak.   With TLR's expected again for 
friday, the night guys at FPC and FPL are going to let the day guys make a 
decision on any b.o.d preschedules.

Subject: saturday's action

FRCC-- For Saturday.   FPL and FPC were buying in the mid 40's for HE 9-12.  
For HE 13-17 they were bidding  mid 50's to low 60's. Starting HE 12 TLR's 
prevented any nf-h going into FRCC.   Our hourly sale to FPL was bumped  due 
to implementation of firm trans.  We were buying nf-h.   


SERC--For Saturday.  SOCO began to bid in the mid-30's starting HE 12.   For 
HE 13 TVA called a TLR and SOCO lost about 400 mw's that he was buying from 
TVA and others.  They did not change their bid after these cuts, they told us 
they were going to bring up their own units and would only buy for $35.  
DUK,SCEG,OPC and TVA were flat all day or selling a little each hour to 
SOCO.  No bids from these utilities for Saturday.  

ERCOT--For Saturday.  Very quiet day in ERCOT.   Bid's were in the 30's with 
offer's in the high $40's to low 60's.  TU claimed he was buying in the 
$35-$37 range for he 13-18.  HLP was flat for these hours.  CSW was a low 
30's bid with a mid 50's offer.   Smaller players were low 30's bid.    

ecar
The utilities directly connected to the pool were
offering out power in the twenties for most of
saturday. AEP was a mid teen bid for Sat urday
morning, and was offering out mid twenties for the
afternoon. Sige and DPl were on the bid but wouldn't
pay more than low to mid 20's.

Main
CE was offering poer in the low twenties all day. We
actually bought $20 late in the afternoon. IP was flat
all day since we stole all their guys. AMRN was
offering power all day around 23. Lots of TLR's

A new teacher started her class by saying, "Whoever thinks they're stupid
can stand up."  After a few seconds, little Johnny stood.  "Do you think
you're stupid, little Johnny?" she asked.  "No ma'am," he replied, "but I
hate to see you standing there all by yourself."

Barney Can't Compete
In the Minneapolis Star-Tribune (1/17/98) Judy Zmerold writes:

Three-year-old Katie was taken to her pediatrician during a recent
bout with the flu. As the doctor examined her ears, he asked, "Will I find Big
Bird in here?"

Apprehensively, Katie replied, "No."

Then, before examining her throat, he asked, "Will I find the Cookie
Monster in here?"

Again, "No."

Finally, listening to her heart, he asked, "Will I find Barney in here?"

With innocent conviction, she looked him directly in the eye and
said, "No, Jesus is in my heart. Barney is on my underwear."

Subject: Update on deals

Hello Judy!

 Thanks for getting those Royal Bank deals out to me.  I checked with Melinda 
on the status of the J. Aron and Engage deals that we were still needing a 
copy of.  We looked into the J. Aron deal NE4572.1 and it was flagged as 
executed by Bob Bowen, and she was wondering if we will be requesting a copy 
of the deal from J.Aron since we don't have a copy.  She was also wondering 
if the status in TAGG will also be changed.  For the Engage deal NN3957.1 the 
status shows that is was sent to c/p June 21/00.  Jeff Sorenson said that 
there is a revision which he is currently doing, and we would need to ask him 
to send us a confirm.  There was a confirm sent to Engage Canda and a error 
letter was sent to Engage US.  Perhaps the status was never updated?  If you 
could look into this for me I would greatly appreciate it.

Thanks again Judy

  "I went to a party, Mom"

  I went to a party,
  and remembered what you said.
  You told me not to drink, Mom
  so I had a sprite instead.

  I felt proud of myself,
  the way you said I would,
  that I didn't drink and drive,
  though some friends said I should.

  I made a healthy choice,
  and your advice to me was right
  as the party finally ended,
  and the kids drove out of sight.

  I got into my car,
  sure to get home in one piece,
  I never knew what was coming, Mom
  something I expected least.

  Now I'm lying on the pavement,
  And I hear the policeman say,
  The kid that caused this wreck was drunk,"
  Mom, His voice seems far away.

  My own blood's all around me,
  as I try hard not to cry.
  I can hear the paramedic say,
  This girl is going to die."

  I'm sure the guy had no idea,
  while he was flying high,
  because he chose to drink and drive,
  now I would have to die.

  So why do people do it, Mom
  Knowing that it ruins lives?
  And now the pain is cutting me,
  like a hundred stabbing knives.

  Tell sister not to be afraid, Mom
  tell daddy to be brave,
  and when I go to heaven,
  put "Daddy's Girl" on my grave.

  Someone should have taught him,
  that its wrong to drink and drive.
  Maybe if his parents had,
  I'd still be alive.

  My breath is getting shorter, Mom
  I'm getting really scared.
  These are my final moments,
  and I'm so unprepared.

  I wish that you could hold me Mom,
  as I lie here and die.
  I wish that I could say I love you, Mom
  So I love you and good-bye.

Subject: checkout for 5/3 hourly deals

Guys,

I know this is getting to the point of nagging, but the day guys are doing a 
BAD job of getting there stuff in the P&L and Enpower.  We are having to 
spend too much time going back and researching tags and comparing enpower to 
P&L and vice versa before we can even begin to checkout.  I spent two hours 
having to go through many deals (in both books) to figure out what happened 
before we could begin checkouts.  I understand some human errors occur - 
that's why we do checkout's but much of this I feel is just laziness and guys 
not paying attention.  Can you guys address this and try to implement some 
steps to help correct this.  With the lack of bodies on the night shift, this 
is causing problems.

Thanks,
Doug

SERC-   For Saturday we sold 200MW (HE15-19 for a 5 hour take) @ $80.00.  
SCEG and DUKE were bidding in the mid 40's.  Due to TLR's power from the 
North could not flow to SERC.  Off-peak bids for Saturday were in the low 
teens.  SOCO was an $11 bid for off-peak.  Everyone else in SERC was flat or 
a low teen bid.  For Sunday SOCO was a $26 bid during the afternoon peak.  
SCEG was a $34 bid.  TLR's prevented any deals getting done with SCEG during 
the afternoon.  DUKE, SCEG and SOSO will be on the bid for Monday.  

FRCC-   For Saturday we sold power to Florida in the morning but were cut due 
to TLR's starting HE11.  Bids in Florida got to as high as mid 60's.  FPL and 
FPC were the one's bidding in the mid 60's.  TLR's were not lifted until H/E 
1, for H/E 1 we sold FPL $22(100mw's) into JEA.  For Sunday FP&L and TALL 
were both on the BID @ $26-35 Hourly in the morning and  BOD @ $ 55-65.00.  
Sunday morning we began buying  power from CE  and selling it to FPL and 
TALL.  TLR's were called startng H/E 11.  Florida was bidding in the mid 40's 
for a 16-hour schedule for Monday.    Offpeak bids were in the mid teens for 
both Saturday and Sunday night.

ERCOT-  For Saturday bids were in the low to mid 30's.  Offers were in the 
high 40's(CSW and HLP) to mid 50's(TU).  We sold the City of GARLAND $54 for 
he 23 and 24.  Their bid was high due to trans. contraints from the south to 
north.  They had bought power from San Antonio and Reliant which ended up 
being cut.  We ended up buying from CSW(wtu-$48) thinking this was north 
enough.  The ISO killed the deal.  They told us that as of Friday WTU will 
not be allowed to send out any power when south to north transmission is set 
to -0-.  For Sunday bids were in the 30's again.  Reliant and TU told us they 
will be bidding for HE 14-21.  We purchased trans. into ERCOT for these 
hours.

Subject: Love Ya!

Did Anyone Ever Tell You,
Just How Special You Are
The Light that You Emit
Might even Light a Star

Did Anyone Ever Tell You
How Important You Make Others Feel
Somebody out here is Smiling
About Love that is so Real

Did Anyone Ever Tell You
Many Times, When They were Sad
Your E-mail made Them Smile a bit
In Fact It made Them Glad

For the Time You Spend Sending Things
And Sharing whatever You Find
There are No Words to Thank You
But Somebody, Thinks You're Fine

Did Anyone Ever Tell You
Just How Much They Love You
Well,  My Dearest " Online "  Friend
Today I am Telling You

 ++++++++++++++++++

I HOPE I GET THIS BACK

I believe that without a friend
you are missing out on a lot!!!
Don't be confused by friends and
acquaintances, there is a difference!

Because I care about you,

It's national care week . . .
and you get to send messages to 
all your friends telling them 
that you care about them and 
make them feel good about
themselves and if they write
back . . . (just once)
then that means that they care
about you too.

BUT, you have to send it right now!!
Send it to everyone you care
about and if they send it back . . . 
that means they care too.
but don't just send it back,
send it on to everyone..

Have a nice day, and I'm glad we
are friends!!!

Sent by: Enron Announcements

Subject: Organization Announcement

Given the growth in EES it has become apparent that it is time to consolidate 
the risk functions between EES and EWS.  This will provide EES with the 
systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups 
necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market 
opportunities.

With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk 
groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing, 
structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and 
back-office services.  These groups main function is to provide these 
services to EES.  We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice 
President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the 
Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will 
continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice 
President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the 
Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim 
Belden.

These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while 
ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading 
organizations.

These changes are effective immediately.  Please congratulate Rogers and Don 
on their new roles.

> >> From a woman who works in a police department:
> >>
> >>
> >>    I have to share some things I have learned in my job
> >>    with you.
> >>
> >>    In my job, I review criminal and psychiatric files of
> >>    imprisoned sex offenders who are approaching their
> >>    release date.  I decide if they are likely to re-offend
> >>    based on certain criteria and then civilly commit them
> >>    to a sex offender treatment facility if I decide that
> >>    they are at significant risk to re-offend
> >>
> >>    I have read hundreds and hundreds of files, and have
> >>    taken note of some of the mistakes women make.  Let me
> >>    preface this by saying that a woman is NEVER EVER EVER
> >>    at fault for being raped or attacked, but there are
> >>    definitely ways to reduce your risk of being a victim.
> >>
> >>    Here are the most common mistakes women make that
> >>    could result in them getting kidnapped, attacked,
> >>    and/or raped:
> >>
> >>    1.  Getting into the attacker's car when he pulls a
> >>    gun and orders you to get into his vehicle.
> >>
> >>    Most attackers don't want to shoot you ... they want
> >>    you to get into the car so that they can drive you to
> >>    a deserted place and torture you.  Don't comply.  Run
> >>    screaming.  It is MUCH more likely than not that he
> >>    will just move on to an easier target.
> >>
> >>    2.  Pulling over when a man drives alongside of you
> >>    pointing at your car pretending something is wrong.
> >>
> >>    If this happens, drive to the nearest well-lit and
> >>    populated gas station and look the car over yourself
> >>    (or ask an attendant).  Never pull over.  Believe it
> >>    or not, many women have fallen for this for fear of
> >>    their car spontaneously exploding in the middle of the
> >>    road.  Not likely.
> >>
> >>    3.  Not locking your doors while driving.
> >>
> >>    I have read several cases where the attacker simply
> >>    walks up to a woman's car while she's at a traffic
> >>    light and jumps in with his gun or knife drawn.
> >>
> >>    4.  Opening your front door when you have not
> >>    positively identified who is there.
> >>
> >>    If you don't have a peep hole, get one.  I've seen
> >>    countless cases where the attacker gains access to his
> >>    victims simply by knocking on their door.
> >>
> >>    Don't let an attacker get into your home.  He then has
> >>    a private, relatively soundproof place to attack you.
> >>
> >>    5.  Not being alert in parking lots.
> >>
> >>    If you go to the grocery store at night, don't be shy
> >>    about asking for an escort to your car.  Too many
> >>    women are abducted from parking lots or even raped in
> >>    the parking lot.
> >>
> >>    Look in your back seat before entering your car.  Cars
> >>    provide endless hiding places for attackers, both
> >>    inside them and in between them.
> >>
> >>    Be aware of your surroundings by looking to the left
> >>    and right and behind you with your head up all the
> >>    time.  You may appear paranoid and look funny to
> >>    others, but an attacker will think twice about
> >>    approaching someone who appears so aware of what's
> >>    going on.
> >>
> >>    6.  Trusting a clean cut, honest looking stranger.
> >>
> >>    I see mug shots of every sex offender in the state of
> >>    Florida.  They do not look like monsters.  They often
> >>    look like they could be your friendly grocer, bank
> >>    teller, waiter, neighbor, clergy, doctor, etc.  They
> >>    are every age between 15 and 90, and probably beyond.
> >>    Only a small minority actually look scary.
> >>
> >>    I just read a case yesterday of a man with only one
> >>    leg who beat up his victim with his crutch before he
> >>    raped her.  Who would have ever thought that a
> >>    one-legged man could be a rapist?
> >>
> >> 7.  Trusting people to be alone with your children.
> >>
> >> This is a difficult one, because child molesters end
> >> up being the LAST person the parents would believe is
> >> the molester.
> >>
> >> Most of the child molesting cases I see involve the

> >> mother's boyfriend, the grandfather, the baby-sitter,
> >> the neighbor, the family friend, the youth camp
> >> director, day care worker, etc.  Although rare, even

> >>
> >> In every case, the perpetrator is a nice guy,
> >> trusting, good with children, and the family is

This is a nice story, I hope you enjoy it.

> > A long time ago, there was a huge apple tree.  A little boy loved to

> > Time went by... the little boy had grown up and he no longer played
> > around the tree everyday.  One day, the boy came back to the tree and
> > he looked sad. "Come and play with me," the tree asked the boy.

> > replied, "I want toys. I need money to buy them."
> > "Sorry, but I don't have money...but you can pick all my apples and
> > sell them.  So, you will have money."  The boy was so excited.  He
> > grabbed all the apples on the tree and left happily.  The boy never
> > came back after he picked the apples.  The tree was sad.
> > One day, the boy returned and the tree was so excited. "Come and
> > play with me" the tree said. "I don't have time to play.  I have to
> > work for family. We need a house for shelter. Can you help me?"
> > "Sorry, but I don't have a house. But you can chop off my branches
> > to build your house." So the boy cut all the branches of the tree
> > and left happily. The tree was glad to see him happy but the boy
> > never came back since then. The tree was again lonely and sad.
> > One hot summer day, the boy returned and the tree was delighted.
> > "Come and play with me!" the tree said. "I am sad and getting old." the > 
> boy replied.  I want to go sailing to relax myself. Can you give me a
> > boat?"
> > "Use my trunk to build your boat. You can sail far away and be happy."
> > So the boy cut the tree trunk to make a boat. He went sailing and
> > never showed up for a long time.
> > Finally, the boy returned after he left for so many years.
> > "Sorry, my boy. But I don't have anything for you anymore. No more
> > apples for you..." the tree said. "I don't have teeth to bite" the boy
> > replied.
> > "No more trunk for you to climb on"
> > "I am too old for that now" the boy said.
> > "I really can't give you anything ... the only thing left is my dying
> > roots" the tree said with tears.
> > "I don't need much now, just a place to rest. I am tired after all
> > these years." The boy replied.
> > "Good! Old tree roots is the best place to lean on and rest.  Come,
> > Come sit down with me and rest."
> > The boy sat down and the tree was glad and smiled, with tears.......> >

> > This is a story of everyone. The tree is our parent.
> > When we were young, we loved to play with Mom and Dad...  When we

> > No matter what, parents will always be there and give everything they

If you are eligible for a 1999 annual bonus payment, you will receive your 
bonus on Thursday, February 3rd.  

The distribution of bonus funds (net amount after deferrals and taxes) will 
follow your normal semi-monthly payroll deposit method as follows:

If you normally receive a paycheck, your bonus will be in the form of a 
paycheck
If you normally receive a direct deposit, your bonus will be direct deposited 
to your bank account 
For those employees who have taken advantage of the multiple direct deposit 
functionality, your bonus will be deposited to your primary bank account
If you have deferred 100% of your bonus,  you will receive a letter 
confirming your deferral. A pay advice statement will not be delivered

Please call 713-853-9567 should you have any questions concerning the 
distribution of your annual bonus.

Subject: A little something for you!

Hi everyone, a good friend sent this to me today, and
I wanted to share it with all of you.  Have a great
semester!!

Maria


 Friend



When you receive this, say a prayer.  That's all you
have to do.  There
is
nothing attached.  This is powerful.  Just send this
to four people and
do
not break this, please.  Prayer is one of the best
free gifts we
receive.
There is no cost but a lot of rewards. Let's continue
praying for one
another.

Father, I ask you to bless my friends reading this
right now Lord, show
them

a new revelation of Your love and power.  Holy Spirit,
I ask You to
minister

to their spirit at this very moment.  Where there is
pain, give them
Your
peace and Mercy.  Where there is self-doubting,
release a renewed
confidence

in Your ability to work through them.  Where there is
tiredness, or
exhaustion, I ask You to give them understanding,
patience, and
strength as
they learn submission to Your leading.  Where there is
spiritual
stagnation,

I ask You to renew them by revealing Your nearness,
and by drawing them
into

greater intimacy with You.  Where there is fear,
reveal Your love, and
release to them Your courage.  Where there is a sin
blocking them,
reveal
it, and break its hold over my friend's life.  Bless
their finances,
give
them greater vision, and raise up leaders, and friends
to support, and
encourage them.  Give each of them discernment to
recognize the demonic
forces around them, and reveal to them the power they
have in You to
defeat
it.  I ask You to do these things in Jesus' name.

In Christian love,
Your Friend in Jesus.

Passing this on to anyone you consider a friend will
bless you both.
Passing this on to one not considered a friend is
something I know
Christ
would do.

A simple friend has never seen you cry. 
A real friend has shoulders soggy from your tears.
 
A simple friend doesn't know your parents' first names.
A real friend has their phone numbers in his address book.  

A simple friend brings a bottle of wine to your party.
A real friend comes early to help you cook and stays late to
help you clean.

A simple friend hates it when you call after he has gone to bed.
A real friend asks you why you took so long to call. 

A simple friend seeks to talk with you about your problems.
A real friend seeks to help you with your problems.

A simple friend wonders about your romantic history.
A real friend could blackmail you with it.

A simple friend, when visiting, acts like a guest.
A real friend opens your refrigerator and helps himself.

A simple friend thinks the friendship is over when you have
anargument.
A real friend knows that it's not a friendship until after
you've had a fight.

A simple friend expects you to always be there for them.
A real friend expects to always be there for you!

Pass this on to anyone you care about....if you get it back you
have found your true friends.

A ball is a circle, No beginning, No end.  It keeps us together,
like our circle of friends, but the treasure inside for you to see is
the treasure of friendship you've granted to me.

Today I pass the friendship ball to you.  Pass it on to someone
who is a friend to you.

Subject: A mother's thoughts


Hi ladies.  Even though mother's day has past, I thought you would enjoy 
reading this e-mail I received last week.  It's real good.

A Mother's Thoughts:

We are sitting at lunch when my daughter casually mentions that she and her 
husband are thinking of "starting a family." "We're taking a survey," she 
says, half-joking. "Do you think I should have a baby?"

"It will change your life, "I say, carefully keeping my tone neutral.

"I know," she says, "no more sleeping in on weekends, no more
spontaneous vacations...."

But that is not what I meant at all.  I look at my daughter, trying to
decide what to tell her.  I want her to know what she will never learn in 
childbirth classes.  I want to tell her that the physical wounds of child 
bearing will heal, but that becoming a mother will leave her with an 
emotional wound so raw that she will forever be vulnerable.  I consider 
warning her that she will never again read a newspaper without asking "What 
if that had been MY child?" That every plane crash,every house fire will 
haunt her.  That when she sees pictures of starving children, she will wonder 
if anything could be worse than watching your child die.  I look at her 
carefully manicured nails and stylish suit and think that no matter
how sophisticated she is, becoming a mother will reduce her to the
primitive level of a bear protecting her cub.  That an urgent call of "Mom!" 
will cause her to drop a souffl, or her best crystal without a moment's 
hesitation.  I feel I should warn her that no matter how many years she has 
invested in her career, she will be professionally derailed by motherhood.  
She might arrange for childcare, but one day she will be going into an 
important
business meeting and she will think of her baby's sweet smell.  She will have 
to use every ounce of her discipline to keep from running home, just to make 
sure her baby is all right.  I want my daughter to know that everyday 
decisions will no longer be
routine.  That a five year old boy's desire to go to the men's room
rather than the women's at McDonald's will become a major dilemma. That right 
there, in the midst of clattering trays and screaming children, issues of 
independence and gender identity will be weighed against the prospect that a 
child molester may be lurking in that restroom.  However decisive she may be 
at the office, she will second-guess herself constantly as a mother.
Looking at my attractive daughter, I want to assure her that eventually she 
will shed the pounds of pregnancy, but she will never feel the same about 
herself.  That her life, now so important, will be of less value to her once 
she has a child.  That she would give it up in a moment to save her 
offspring, but will also begin to hope for more years-not to accomplish her 
own dreams, but to watch her child accomplish theirs.  I want her to know 
that a cesarean scar or shiny stretch marks will become badges of honor.  My 
daughter's relationship with her husband will change,
but not in the way she thinks.  I wish she could understand how much more you 
can love a man who is careful to powder the baby or who never hesitates to 
play with his child.  I think she should know that she will fall in love with 
him again for reasons she would now find every unromantic.  I wish my 
daughter could sense the bond she will feel with women throughout history who 
have tried to stop war, prejudice and drunk driving.  I hope she will 
understand why I can think rationally about most issues, but become 
temporarily insane when I discuss the threat of nuclear war to my
children's future.  I want to describe to my daughter the exhilaration of 
seeing your child learn to ride a bike.  I want to capture for her the belly 
laugh of a baby who is touching the soft fur of a dog or a cat for the first 
time.  I want  her to  taste the joy that is so real, it actually hurts.  My 
daughter's quizzical look makes me realize that tears have formed in my eyes.

"You'll never regret it," I finally say. Then I reach across the table, 
squeeze my daughter's hand and offer a silent prayer for her,and
for me, and for all of the mere mortal women who stumble their way into this 
most wonderful of callings.  This blessed gift from God that of being a 
Mother.

Please share this with a Mom that you know or a future Mom you know.

FW:? A SERIOUS MEXICAN BIRTHDAY  PARTY!
?
You know you are at a SERIOUS MEXICAN BIRTHDAY  PARTY IF:
?
1.??? Some of the guests didn't  bring a gift, but brought extra uninvited 
kids.
2.??? When the cake says "Happy  Birthday Mijo" instead of the child's real 
name.
3.??? The party is at Chuck E.  Cheese, but they brought their own food, 
cake, and a pinata.
4.??? It's a party, but there are  more grown-ups than children.
5.??? It's "Mijo's" 1st Birthday and  the party food is carne asada, arroz 
con frijoles puercos, y 10 cases of  beer.
6.??? For entertainment, instead of  playing pin the tail on the donkey, 
there is usually a televised baseball,  football game, or a live fight.
7.??? They don't sing Happy  Birthday, instead everyone is salsa dancing.
8.??? The party was over at 5:00,  it's 10:00 and the party is just starting.
9.??? You find out from Abuela that  Abuelo is taking viagra.
10.??? The host calls someone who's  on their way and tells them to stop and 
get some tortillas and ice.
11.??? The guests start arriving and  the hostess disappears to get ready.
12.??? You hear someone go up to the  birthday child and say "Mira, tan cute!"
13.??? Someone else says? "I'm  going to have to get you something next week 
when I get paid.
14.??? The party is Saturday, and  you get a call from the hostess Friday 
night saying, "I'm giving Mijo a birthday  party tomorrow at 3:00."
15.??? Some guests bring gifts that  are still in the store bag unwrapped.
16.??? There always seems to be more  family than friends at the party.
17.??? You have the party over at  your's brother's because he bought a new 
house and he has a pool.
18.??? The cake didn't come from the  store; it came from the mother of the 
comadre of your friend's sister who makes  really good cakes.
19.??? You are told you have to save  your plate and fork you ate your food 
with, so you can eat you  cake.
20.??? Someone calls and says they  can't make it, but asks that you save 
them some cake.
21.??? Guests are wrapping up cake  to take to Madre, Tio, Abuela, Chata y el 
Junior.
22.??? The party music is coming  from a small boom box.
23.??? The birthday child is dressed  from head to toe in Tommy.
24.??? The birthday baby's Daddy  comes to the party and brings the kid he 
had before and after the Birthday  Baby.
25.??? It's "Mijo's" party, but  since his cousin Madonna is there and her 
birthday is in a few days, it becomes  Mijo's and Madonna's party.
?
Power to la Raza
?
I thought this was?something to share with all  you REAL Mexicans and those 
who are still trying to get to know  us..........

Subject: He's Crazy About You!


If God had a refrigerator, your picture would be on it.
If He had a wallet, your photo would be in it.
He sends you flowers every spring and a sunrise every morning.
Whenever you want to talk, He'll listen.
He can live anywhere in the universe, and He chose your heart.
What about the Christmas gift He sent you in Bethlehem; not to
mention that Friday at Calvary.
Face it, friend. He's crazy about you.

______________________________________________
Let's not forget.

Love Ya!

Something to think about....

> >>Maybe God wants us to meet a few wrong people
before meeting the right one so that when we finally
meet the right person, we will know how to be grateful
for that gift.
> >>
> >>When the door of happiness closes, another opens,
but often times we look so long at the closed door
that we don't see the one which has been opened for
us.
> >>
> >>The best kind of friend is the kind you can sit on
a porch and swing with,never say a word, and then walk
away feeling like it was the best conversation you've
ever had.
> >>
> >>It's true that we don't know what we've got until
we lose it, but it's also true that we don't know what
we've been missing until it arrives.
> >>
> >>Giving someone all your love is never an assurance
that they'll love you back!  Don't expect love in
return; just wait for it to grow in their heart but if
it doesn't, be content it grew in yours.
> >>
> >>It takes only a minute to get a crush on someone,
an hour to like someone,and a day to love someone, but
it takes a lifetime to forget someone.
> >>
> >>Don't go for looks; they can deceive.  Don't go
for wealth; even that fades away.Go for someone who
makes you smile because it takes only a smile to make
a dark day seem bright.  Find the one that makes your
heart smile.
> >>
> >>There are moments in life when you miss someone so
much that you just want to pick them from your dreams
and hug them for real!
> >>
> >>Dream what you want to dream; go where you want to
go; be what you want to be,because you have only one
life and one chance to do all the things you want to
do.
> >>
> >>May you have enough happiness to make you sweet,
enough trials to make you strong, enough sorrow to
keep you human, enough hope to make you  happy.
> >>
> >>Always put yourself in others' shoes.  If you feel
that it hurts you, it probably hurts the other person,
too.
> >>
> >>The happiest of people don't necessarily have the
best of everything; they just make the most of
everything that comes along their way.
> >>
> >>Happiness lies for those who cry, those who hurt,
those who have searched,and those who have tried, for
only they can appreciate the importance of people who
have touched their lives.
> >>
> >>Love begins with a smile, grows with a kiss and
ends with a tear.

The brightest future will always be based on a
forgotten past, you can't go on well in life until you
let go of your past failures and heartaches.
> >>
> >>When you were born, you were crying and everyone
around you was smiling. Live your life so that when
you die, you're the one who is smiling and everyone
around you is crying.
> >>
> >>
> >>
> >>Please send this message to those people who mean
something to you, to those who have touched your life
in one way or another, to those who make you smile
when you really need it, to those that make you see
the
brighter side of things when you are really down, to
those who you want to let them know that you
appreciate their friendship.  And if you don't, don't
worry, nothing bad will happen to you, you will just
miss out on the opportunity to  brighten someone's day
with this message........

Subject: A Man's Perspective


TO WOMEN EVERYWHERE FROM A MAN WHO'S HAD ENOUGH...

If you think you're fat, you probably are. Don't ask us. We refuse to
answer.

Learn to work the toilet seat. If it's up, put it down.

If you won't dress like the Victoria's Secret girls, don't expect us to act=
=20
like soap opera guys.

Don't cut your hair. Ever. Long hair is always more attractive than short=
=20
hair. One of the big reasons guys fear getting married is that married wome=
n=20
always cut their hair, and by then you're stuck with her.

Birthdays, Valentines, and Anniversaries are not quests to see if we can
find the perfect present yet again!

If you ask a question you don't want an answer to, expect an answer you
don't want to hear.

Sometimes, we're not thinking about you. Live with it. Don't ask us what
we're thinking about unless you are prepared to discuss such topics as
navel lint, the shotgun formation, or monster trucks.

Sunday =3D sports. It's like the full moon or the changing of the tides.
Let it be.

Shopping is not a sport, and no, we're never going to think of it that
way.

When we have to go somewhere, absolutely anything you wear is fine.
Really.

You have enough clothes.  You have too many shoes.

Crying is blackmail.

Ask for what you want. Let's be clear on this one: Subtle hints don't work.
Strong hints don't work. Really obvious hints don't work. Just say it!

No, we don't know what day it is. We never will. Mark anniversaries on
the calendar.

Peeing standing up is more difficult. We're bound to miss sometimes.

Most guys own three pairs of shoes-what makes you think we'd be any good
at choosing which pair, out of thirty, would look good with your dress?

Yes and No are perfectly acceptable answers to almost every question.

Come to us with a problem only if you want help solving it. That's what
we do. Sympathy is what your girlfriends are for.

A headache that lasts for 17 months is a problem. See a doctor.

Foreign films are best left to foreigners.

Check your oil.

It is neither in your best interest nor ours to take the quiz together.
No, it doesn't matter which quiz.

Anything we said 6 months ago is inadmissible in an argument. All comments
become null and void after 7 days.

If something we said can be interpreted two ways, and one of the ways
makes you sad or angry, we meant the other one.

Let us ogle. We're going to look anyway; it's genetic.

You can either tell us to do something OR tell us how to do something
but not both.

Whenever possible, please say whatever you have to say during
commercials..

ALL men see in only 16 colors. Peach is a fruit, not a color.

If it itches, it will be scratched.

Beer is as exciting for us as handbags are for you.

If we ask what's wrong and you say "nothing," we will act like nothing's=20
wrong. We know you're lying, but it's just not worth the hassle.

What the heck is a doily anyway?

Reason, Season and Lifetime


People come into your life for a reason, a season, or a lifetime.
When you figure out which it is, you know exactly what to do.
When someone is in your life for a REASON, it is usually to
meet a need you have expressed outwardly or inwardly.
They have come to assist you through a difficulty, to provide you
with guidance and support, to aid you physically, emotionally, or
spiritually.
They may seem like a godsend, and they are.
They are there for the reason you need them to be.
Then, without any wrong doing on your part or at an inconvenient time, this
person willsay or do something to bring the relationship to an end.
Sometimes they die. Sometimes they walk away.
Sometimes they act up or out and force you to take a stand.
What we must realize is that our need has been  met, our desire fulfilled;
their work is done.
The prayer you sent up has been answered and it is now time to move on.

When people come into your life for a SEASON, it is because
 your turn has come to share, grow, or learn.
They may bring you an experience of  peace or make you laugh.
They may teach you something you have never done.
They usually give you an unbelievable amount of joy. Believe it!
It is real!  But, only for a season.

LIFETIME relationships teach you lifetime lessons; those things
you must build upon in order to have a solid emotional foundation.
Your job is to accept the lesson, love the person/people (anyway); and put
what  you have learned to use in all other relationships and areas of your
life.
It is said that love is blind but friendship is clairvoyant.

Thank you for being a part of my life... Smile and stop here if you're not
into this final part: This is to show people you love them and to see how
many people love you!!
Don't feel embarrassed cause only you will get the results. Send it to every
friend
that you have online, including the person who sent it to you.

0 Replies = you may need to work on your people skills
2 Replies = you are nice but probably need to be more outgoing.
4 Replies = you have picked your friends well
6 Replies = you are downright popular
8 Replies or More = you are totally awesome (and probably know why you're on
MY list)!

When you receive this e-mail just recite the following prayer.
That's all you have to do. There is nothing attached. This is the power of
prayer
at work. Just send this to (4) people and see what happens on the fourth
day.
Do not break this, please. There is no cost, but lots of rewards.

PRAYER:
May today there be peace within you. May you trust God that you are exactly
where you are meant to be. May you not forget the infinite possibilities
that are born of faith. May you use those gifts that you have
received, and pass on the love that has been given to you. May you be
content
knowing that you are a child of God. Let His presence settle into your
bones, and allow your soul the freedom to sing, dance, and to bask in the
sun.
It is there for each and every one of you.

Send this to (4) or more people and witness the awesome power
of prayer.

God Bless.

FRCC-- For Saturday.   FPL and FPC were buying in the mid 40's for HE 9-12.  
For HE 13-17 they were bidding  mid 50's to low 60's. Starting HE 12 TLR's 
prevented any nf-h going into FRCC.   Our hourly sale to FPL was bumped  due 
to implementation of firm trans.  We were buying nf-h.   


SERC--For Saturday.  SOCO began to bid in the mid-30's starting HE 12.   For 
HE 13 TVA called a TLR and SOCO lost about 400 mw's that he was buying from 
TVA and others.  They did not change their bid after these cuts, they told us 
they were going to bring up their own units and would only buy for $35.  
DUK,SCEG,OPC and TVA were flat all day or selling a little each hour to 
SOCO.  No bids from these utilities for Saturday.  

ERCOT--For Saturday.  Very quiet day in ERCOT.   Bid's were in the 30's with 
offer's in the high $40's to low 60's.  TU claimed he was buying in the 
$35-$37 range for he 13-18.  HLP was flat for these hours.  CSW was a low 
30's bid with a mid 50's offer.   Smaller players were low 30's bid.

Subject: March Surveys

Hello,

We have prepared January and February data and will be scheduling meetings 
with you in the next few weeks.  For the month of March, please provide a 
completed "Hours" survey for each position within your group.  This survey 
will collect the  time your team spent on performing their activities in the 
month of March.   

NOTE: We are now collecting EOL related activities.  If you spend time 
directly supporting EOL, and your survey does not have an activity that you 
can assign these times to, please contact me as soon as possible so we can 
add the appropriate activities to your survey.

To fill out the survey:

At the top of the spreadsheet, you will see a box labelled "Select Your RC".  
Click on the box and input your RC number, which will need to be 4 digits.
Once you have done this, another box will appear with the message "Select 
Position from Drop Box!" You can then select the position (i.e., staff, 
specialist, etc.) and "OK". The choices for positions are based on 
information contained in the Org Database (i.e., if a position is not listed 
that should be, please call me to discuss as it would indicate that 
corrections need to be made to the database).  Once you have the list of 
activities, please input hours (for the entire month) for each activity 
listed in the column labelled "Hours".
If you're filling out the survey for your team, save a file for each of the 
positions you fill out for your team prior to filling out the next position.  
If you do not, the information will be lost.

We have included February compiled hours per position (if you had two 
specialists performing the same activity - 20 hours each, the "Last Month" 
column would show a total of 40 hrs for that month).  As with last month, you 
have the option to complete the survey on behalf of your entire group or send 
this survey to each of your team members, allowing each individual to fill 
out the time they spent on each activity.  If there are any activities you 
perform not included in your survey, please contact me as soon as possible 
for a copy of the Activity Dictionary.

Please return these surveys by end of day Wednesday, April 5th.  If this is a 
problem, please notify me or Lisa Cousino immediately.

Thanks,
Shari

Country Doctor

An old country doctor went deep into the woods to  deliver a
baby. The cabin was so remote that it had no electricity.
Upon  arriving, the doctor realized that the laboring mother
and her five-year-old  child were the only people there.
With no one else to help him, the doctor  finally instructed
the child to hold a lantern so he could see to deliver  the
baby.
The child was happy to help, and held the lantern high
while  the mother pushed. After a little while, the baby was
born, and the doctor  held the newborn by the feet and
spanked him on the bottom to get him to take  his first
breath.
With the excitement over, the doctor asked  the
five-year-old for an opinion about the baby.

"Hit him again," the  five-year-old said. "He shouldn't have
crawled up there in the first  place!"

ECAR
  
There was plenty of generation online for Sat. and Sun.  FE offered out 150 
mw's at $38 for a 16-hr. schedule for Monday.  No one had any interest at 
this price level.  There were no decent bids for saturday or sunday.   On 
saturday we moved  Ecar power down to Florida most of the day until TLR's 
were called.  On sunday during the evening peak Soco was on the bid($25), 
unfortunately TLR's prevented any energy from moving into Serc.  Most 
utilities will be sellers in the morning.   

 ECAR   FRI 16 hour average:  BID  $ 25.6   OFFER $ 27.5
   SAT 16 hour average:  BID  $ 10.5   OFFER $ 26.9
   SUN 16 hour average:  BID  $  9.9  OFFER $ 17.2 


MAIN

 TLR's were abundant over the weekend.  CE, Ameren and other Main members 
were not able to send power into Serc or Frcc.  No legitimate bids while 
sellers had plenty of power.  Ameren was an island due to TLR's.  CE will be 
selling hourly all day Monday.  CE quoted an offer of $36 for a 16-hr 
schedule, for he 7 they quoted $12, with no bids to move it to.   Ameren will 
also be selling hourly if TLR's do not kick in.  No one had any interest in 
picking up a preschedule. 


 MAIN  FRI 16 hour average:  BID  $ 19.7   OFFER $ 30.4
   SAT 16 hour average:  BID  $ 10.1   OFFER $ 20.7
   SUN 16 hour average:  BID  $ 9.4   OFFER $ 15.7

PRAYER WHEEL

When you receive this, say a prayer for the person that sent it to
you.... That's all you have to do....There is nothing attached....This
is powerful.... Just send this to four people and watch God answer
prayer to work in your life.

Do not break this, please.... Prayer is one of the best free gifts we
receive.... There is no cost but a lot of rewards.... Let's continue
praying for one another. Thanks for praying.

complain about things not going right.  Jesus, sitting
with his chin in His hand looks upward toward the building wishing He could=
=20
help me. By lunchtime - I'm flustered, regretting I work in this place and=
=20
sputtering bitterness all over folks. Jesus comes around to the side of the=
=20
building where my cubicle is located. He looks up from the ground trying to=
=20
get my attention but I can't hear him; my focus is on my problems. Jesus go=

back to the front of the building, sits down and continues to wait for me. =
He=20
thinks to
Himself as He looks up to the third floor, "They went in there defenseless.=

If only they had taken me in there with them.  When will they learn?" End o=
f=20
the day - I'm pooped, run down, no energy, irritable & frustrated.  I leave=
=20
the building & Jesus gets up happily to greet me but I'm in no mood for Him=
=20
now.  I've just been to hell and back and the last thing I want to do is be=

bothered with anyone.

God just actually showed me this is how I'VE been acting.  He showed me eac=
h=20
act and worst of all, He let me feel a small
portion of how grieved he was because of my actions and
attitude.  I left Jesus standing outside, almost let the door smack him in=
=20
His face.  From time to time our jobs overwhelm us and we completely forget=
=20
to  "take Jesus with us".  We may not go around cursing anyone out or=20
punching anyone in the face (hopefully not) but what are our actions saying=

about us and about whom or whose we are?

We are the salt of the Earth and the light of the world. A city on a hill=

cannot be hidden.  Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. =

Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the=20

This is really great, it was through my mother's death that I was blessed 
with meeting Tim. The Lord is faithful and so good to us !!


MOM'S LAST LAUGH.....

Consumed by my loss, I didn't notice the hardness of the
pew where I sat.  I was at the funeral of my dearest friend - my mother.

She finally had lost her long battle with cancer. The hurt
was so intense, I found it hard to breathe at times.

Always supportive, Mother clapped loudest at my school
plays, held a box of tissues while listening to my first heartbreak, 
comforted me at my father's death, encouraged me in college,
and prayed for me my entire life.

When Mother's illness was diagnosed, my sister had a new
baby and my brother had recently married his childhood sweetheart, so it fell 
on me, the 27-year-old middle child without entanglements, to take care of 
her. I counted it an honor.

"What now, Lord?" I asked sitting in church. My life
stretched out before me as an empty abyss. My brother sat stoically with his 
face toward the cross while clutching his wife's hand. My sister sat slumped 
against her husband's shoulder,
his arms around her as she cradled their child.

All so deeply grieving, no one noticed I sat alone.

My place had been with our mother, preparing her meals,
helping her walk, taking her to the doctor, seeing to her medication, reading 
the Bible together. Now she was with the Lord.

My work was finished, and I was alone.

I heard a door open and slam shut at the back of the
church. Quick footsteps hurried along the carpeted floor. An exasperated 
young man looked around briefly and then sat
next to me. He folded his hands and placed them on his
lap. His eyes were brimming with tears. He began to sniffle.

"I'm late," he explained, though no explanation was
necessary.  After several eulogies, he leaned over and commented, "Why do 
they keep calling Mary by the name of 'Margaret'?

"0h" "Because that was her name, Margaret. Never Mary. No
one called her 'Mary,'" I whispered. I wondered why this person couldn't have 
sat on the other side of the church. He interrupted my grieving with his 
tears and fidgeting.

Who was this stranger anyway?

"No, that isn't correct," he insisted, as several people
glanced over at us whispering, "Her name is Mary, Mary Peters."

"That isn't who this is."

"Isn't this the Lutheran church?"

"No, the Lutheran church is across the street."   "Oh."

"I believe you're at the wrong funeral, Sir."

The solemnness of the occasion mixed with the realization
of the man's mistake bubbled up inside me and came out as laughter. I cupped 
my hands over my face, hoping it would be interpreted as sobs.  The creaking 
pew gave me away. Sharp looks from other mourners only made the situation 
seem more hilarious. I peeked at the bewildered, misguided man seated beside 
me. He was laughing, too, as he glanced around,
deciding it was too late for an uneventful exit.  I imagined
Mother laughing.

At the final "Amen," we darted out a door and into the
parking lot. "I do believe we'll be the talk of the town," he smiled. He said 
his name was Rick and since he had missed his aunt's funeral, asked me out 
for a cup of coffee.

That afternoon began a lifelong journey for me with this
man who attended the wrong funeral, but was in the right place.

A year after our meeting, we were married at a country church where he was 
the assistant pastor. This time we both arrived at the same church, right on 
time.

In my time of sorrow, God gave me laughter. In place of
loneliness, God gave me love. This past June we celebrated
our twenty-second wedding anniversary.

Whenever anyone asks us how we met, Rick tells them, "Her
mother and my Aunt Mary introduced us, and it's truly a match made in heaven."

                       ------------------------

Jesus said, "if you are ashamed of me," I will be ashamed
of you before my  Father."

Not ashamed Pass this on . . . only if you mean it.

Yes, I do Love God.

 He is my source of existence and Savior. He keeps me
functioning each and everyday. Without Him, I would be nothing. Without him, 
I am nothing, but with Him I can do all things, through Christ that 
strengthens me.  Phil 4:13

If you Love God, and are not ashamed of all the marvelous
things he has done for you. Send this to ten people and the person who sent 
it to you!

The man whispered, "God speak to me" and a meadowlark sang. But the man
did not hear. 

So the man yelled "God speak to me" And the thunder rolled across the sky.
But the man did not listen. 

The man looked around and said, "God let me see you." And a star shined
brightly, but the man did not notice. 

And the man shouted, "God show me a miracle" And a life was born.  But
the man did not know. 

So the man cried out in despair, "Touch me God, and let me know you are
here" Whereupon, God reached down and touched the man. But the man brushed
the butterfly away and walked on. 

Don't miss out on a blessing because it isn't packaged the way that you
expect.  So many times we see miracles and do not recognize them for what
they are. 

My instructions were to send this to four or more people that I wanted God
to bless and I picked you. Please pass this to people you want to be
blessed.

Conformed to His Image
Romans 8:29-30
Faith Thoughts for February 3
by Pastor Carl Stevens

The transformed believer enjoys tremendous freedom. II Corinthians 3:17b
says, "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty." This liberty comes
as the Christian is freed from his natural disposition, with its inevitable
anxiety and loneliness, and is transformed into the image of his Lord. "But
we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are
changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the
Lord" (II Corinthians 3:18).
It is in this manner that the child of God is able to function in the Kingdom
of God. He is transformed by the image of Jesus Christ functioning and
operating in his human vessel, bringing every thought and imagination into
the obedience of Jesus Christ (2). As the believer presents his body as a
living sacrifice to the Lord, he will experience the good, acceptable, and
perfect will of God (3).

Rather than conforming to the world and its system, the believer is inwardly
changed and transformed to the image of Christ by the power of God (4).
Anxiety, cosmic loneliness, and its undefined consequences are dealt with and
resolved in the transformation.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
(1) Romans 8:29-30 For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be
conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many
brethren. (30) Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and
whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also
glorified.
(2) 2 Corinthians 10:5 Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that
exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity
every thought to the obedience of Christ.
(3) Romans 12:1-2 I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God,
that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God,
which is your reasonable service. (2) And be not conformed to this world: but
be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is
that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.
(4) Romans 8:29 For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be
conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many
brethren.

love and blessings

God bless and  have a nice day!

"Father, I ask you to bless my friends, relatives
and email buddies reading this right now.
Show them a new revelation of your love
and power.  Holy Spirit, I ask you to minister
to their spirit at this very moment.
Where there is pain, give them your peace and mercy.
Where there is self-doubt, release a renewed
confidence through your grace, In Jesus precious Name."
Amen

Something to think about....

> >>Maybe God wants us to meet a few wrong people
before meeting the right one so that when we finally
meet the right person, we will know how to be grateful
for that gift.
> >>
> >>When the door of happiness closes, another opens,
but often times we look so long at the closed door
that we don't see the one which has been opened for
us.
> >>
> >>The best kind of friend is the kind you can sit on
a porch and swing with,never say a word, and then walk
away feeling like it was the best conversation you've
ever had.
> >>
> >>It's true that we don't know what we've got until
we lose it, but it's also true that we don't know what
we've been missing until it arrives.
> >>
> >>Giving someone all your love is never an assurance
that they'll love you back!  Don't expect love in
return; just wait for it to grow in their heart but if
it doesn't, be content it grew in yours.
> >>
> >>It takes only a minute to get a crush on someone,
an hour to like someone,and a day to love someone, but
it takes a lifetime to forget someone.
> >>
> >>Don't go for looks; they can deceive.  Don't go
for wealth; even that fades away.Go for someone who
makes you smile because it takes only a smile to make
a dark day seem bright.  Find the one that makes your
heart smile.
> >>
> >>There are moments in life when you miss someone so
much that you just want to pick them from your dreams
and hug them for real!
> >>
> >>Dream what you want to dream; go where you want to
go; be what you want to be,because you have only one
life and one chance to do all the things you want to
do.
> >>
> >>May you have enough happiness to make you sweet,
enough trials to make you strong, enough sorrow to
keep you human, enough hope to make you  happy.
> >>
> >>Always put yourself in others' shoes.  If you feel
that it hurts you, it probably hurts the other person,
too.
> >>
> >>The happiest of people don't necessarily have the
best of everything; they just make the most of
everything that comes along their way.
> >>
> >>Happiness lies for those who cry, those who hurt,
those who have searched,and those who have tried, for
only they can appreciate the importance of people who
have touched their lives.
> >>
> >>Love begins with a smile, grows with a kiss and
ends with a tear.

The brightest future will always be based on a
forgotten past, you can't go on well in life until you
let go of your past failures and heartaches.
> >>
> >>When you were born, you were crying and everyone
around you was smiling. Live your life so that when
you die, you're the one who is smiling and everyone
around you is crying.
> >>
> >>
> >>
> >>Please send this message to those people who mean
something to you, to those who have touched your life
in one way or another, to those who make you smile
when you really need it, to those that make you see
the
brighter side of things when you are really down, to
those who you want to let them know that you
appreciate their friendship.  And if you don't, don't
worry, nothing bad will happen to you, you will just
miss out on the opportunity to  brighten someone's day
with this message........

* THE BEST THINGS IN LIFE *
 >> > >
Falling in love.
Laughing so hard your face hurts.
Hot shower.
No lines at the Super Walmart.
A special glance.
Getting mail.
Taking a drive on a scenic road.
Hearing your favorite song on the radio.
Lying in bed listening to the rain outside.
Hot towels out of the dryer.
Finding the sweater you want is on sale for half price.
Chocolate milkshake.
A long distance phone call.
A bubble bath.
Giggling.
A good conversation.
The beach.
Finding a $20 bill in your coat from last winter.
Laughing at yourself.
Midnight phone calls that last for hours.
Running through sprinklers.
Laughing for absolutely no reason at all.
Having someone tell you that you're beautiful.
Laughing at an inside joke.
Friends.
Falling in love for the first time.
Accidentally overhearing someone say something nice about you.
Waking up and realizing you still have a few hours left to sleep.
Your first kiss.
Making new friends or spending time with old ones.
Playing with a puppy.
Late night talks with your roommate
Having someone play with your hair.
Sweet dreams.
Hot chocolate.
Road trips with friends.
Swinging on swings.
Watching a good movie cuddled up on a couch with someone you love.
Wrapping presents under the Christmas tree while eating cookies and drinking  
eggnog.
Song lyrics printed inside your new CD so you can sing along without feeling 
stupid.
Going to a really good concert.
Making eye contact with a cute stranger.
Making chocolate chip cookies!
Hugging the person you love.
Watching the expression someone's face as they open a much-desired present 
from you.
Watching the sunrise.
Getting out of bed every morning and thanking God for another beautiful day.
 >> > >
PASS ON THESE NATURAL HIGHS TO AT LEAST 7 PEOPLE IN THE NEXT HALF HOUR AND 
GOOD-LUCK WILL COME TO YOU IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS!!

Many people will walk in and out of your life, but only true riends
will leave a footprint in your heart.

 >=====
 >"Deep inside the heart of every man there lies a deep, yawning chasm which 
can only be filled by the one true God."

This is 80% true.

You know you are at a SERIOUS MEXICAN BIRTHDAY  PARTY IF:
?
1.??? Some of the guests didn't  bring a gift, but brought extra uninvited 
kids.
2.??? When the cake says "Happy  Birthday Mijo" instead of the child's real 
name.
3.??? The party is at Chuck E.  Cheese, but they brought their own food, 
cake, and a pinata.
4.??? It's a party, but there are  more grown-ups than children.
5.??? It's "Mijo's" 1st Birthday and  the party food is carne asada, arroz 
con frijoles puercos, y 10 cases of  beer.
6.??? For entertainment, instead of  playing pin the tail on the donkey, 
there is usually a televised baseball,  football game, or a live fight.
7.??? They don't sing Happy  Birthday, instead everyone is salsa dancing.
8.??? The party was over at 5:00,  it's 10:00 and the party is just starting.
9.??? You find out from Abuela that  Abuelo is taking viagra.
10.??? The host calls someone who's  on their way and tells them to stop and 
get some tortillas and ice.
11.??? The guests start arriving and  the hostess disappears to get ready.
12.??? You hear someone go up to the  birthday child and say "Mira, tan cute!"
13.??? Someone else says? "I'm  going to have to get you something next week 
when I get paid.
14.??? The party is Saturday, and  you get a call from the hostess Friday 
night saying, "I'm giving Mijo a birthday  party tomorrow at 3:00."
15.??? Some guests bring gifts that  are still in the store bag unwrapped.
16.??? There always seems to be more  family than friends at the party.
17.??? You have the party over at  your's brother's because he bought a new 
house and he has a pool.
18.??? The cake didn't come from the  store; it came from the mother of the 
comadre of your friend's sister who makes  really good cakes.
19.??? You are told you have to save  your plate and fork you ate your food 
with, so you can eat you  cake.
20.??? Someone calls and says they  can't make it, but asks that you save 
them some cake.
21.??? Guests are wrapping up cake  to take to Madre, Tio, Abuela, Chata y el 
Junior.
22.??? The party music is coming  from a small boom box.
23.??? The birthday child is dressed  from head to toe in Tommy.
24.??? The birthday baby's Daddy  comes to the party and brings the kid he 
had before and after the Birthday  Baby.
25.??? It's "Mijo's" party, but  since his cousin Madonna is there and her 
birthday is in a few days, it becomes  Mijo's and Madonna's party.

SERC- For Saturday SOCO was on the bid  in the mid 40's during the afternoon 
peak.  They were buying up to 500mw from FPL.  The Florida utilities were 
sellers due the rains they were getting in the afternoon.  SCEG was a low 
30's bid during the afternoon bid.  Duke was flat all day.  OPC was also a 
hig 30's bid much of the afternoon.  We managed to sell SOCO 200 mws for 2 
hours until TLR's ended the sale.  

 -For Sunday SOCO was a low 20' bid in the morning and in the afternoon was a 
low 30's bid.  Duke was seller  in the mid 30's all day.  SCEG was also an 
hourly seller, unfortunately SCEG was limited to where they could go.  DUKE 
and VEPCO will have hourly to sell for Monday. 


FRCC-For Saturday Florida was a seller due to rains over much of the state.  
FPL was offering 60's much of the day.  They were a big seller to SOCO much 
of Saturday.  

 -For Sunday things were a little different.  FPL was a bid in the low 60's 
for the afternoon peak.  By afternoon time TLR's prevented any power from 
going into Florida.  


ERCOT- For Saturday an afternoon schedule traded for $75 and after this went 
through ERCOT prices went up.  WE sold $75  to Reliant for HE 16.  For HE 
17-19 no power was to be found in ERCOT.  HLP was $100 bid for these hours.  
TU would not show us bid for these hours.  

 -For Sunday power was offered out at $55 with no bids(low 30's bids).  No 
transmission avail. for HE 14-19 going up to the North.

Like any good mother, when Karen found out that another baby was on the way,
she
did what she could o help her 3-year-old son, Michael, prepare for a new
sibling. They found out that the new baby was going to be a girl, and day
after
day, night after
night, Michael sang to his sister in Mommy's tummy. He was building a bond
of
love with his little sister before he even met her.  The pregnancy
progressed
normally for Karen of Morristown, Tennessee. In time, the labor pains came.
Soon
it was every five minutes, every three ...every  minute.  But serious
complications arose during delivery and Karen found herself in hours of
labor.
Would a C-section be required?  Finally, after a long struggle, Michael's
little
sister was born. But she was in very serious condition.  With a siren
howling in
the night, the ambulance rushed the infant to the neonatal intensive care
unit
at St. Mary's Hospital, Knoxville, Tennessee.

The days inched by. The little girl got worse. The pediatrician had to tell
the
parents,  "There is very little hope. Be prepared for the worst." Karen and
her
husband contacted a local cemetery about a burial plot. They had fixed up a
special room in their house for their new baby but now they found themselves
having to plan for a funeral. Michael, however, kept begging his parents to
let
him see his sister. "I want to sing to her," he kept saying.  Week two in
intensive care looked as if a funeral would come before the week was over.
Michael kept nagging about singing to his sister, but kids are never allowed
in
Intensive Care.

Karen made up her mind, though. She would take Michael whether they liked it
or
not! If he didn't see his sister right then, he may never see her alive.
She
dressed him in an oversized scrub suit and marched him into ICU.  He looked
like
a walking laundry basket. But the head nurse recognized him as a child and
bellowed, "Get that kid out of here now! No children are allowed."
The mother rose up strong in Karen, and the usually mild-mannered lady
glared
steel-eyed right into the head nurse's face, her lips a firm line.
"He is not leaving until he sings to his sister!"
Karen towed Michael to his sister's bedside. He gazed at the tiny infant
losing
the battle to live.  After a moment, he began to sing. In the pure-hearted
voice
of a 3-year-old, Michael sang: "You are my sunshine, my only sunshine, you
make
me happy when skies are gray >>---"
>>Instantly the baby girl seemed to respond. The pulse rate began to calm
down
and become steady. "Keep on singing, Michael," encouraged Karen with tears
in
her eyes.
"You never know, dear, how much I love you, Please don't take my sunshine
away-"
As Michael sang to his sister, the baby's ragged, strained breathing became
as
smooth as a kitten's purr. "Keep on singing, Sweetheart!" "The other night,
dear, as I lay
sleeping, I dreamed I held you in my arms..."
>>Michael's little sister began to relax as rest, healing rest,seemed to
sweep
over her.  "Keep on singing, Michael."  Tears had now conquered the face of
the
bossy head nurse. Karen glowed. "You are my sunshine, my only Sunshine.
Please
don't, take my sunshine away..."
>>The next, day...the very next day...the little girl was well enough to go
home!  Woman's Day Magazine called it "The Miracle of a Brother's Song." The
medical staff just called it a miracle.
Karen called it a miracle of God's love!

 NEVER GIVE UP ON THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE. LOVE IS SO
INCREDIBLY POWERFUL.
Life is good. Have a Wonderful Day!

This is the power of prayer at work.  Let's continue to pray for
one another.

PRAYER:
May today there be peace within you. May you trust God that you are exactly
where you are meant to be. May you not forget the infinite possibilities
that
are born of faith. May you use those gifts that you have received, and pass
on
the love that has been given to you. May you be content knowing that you are
a
child of God. Let His presence settle into your bones, and allow your soul
the
freedom to sing, dance, and to bask in the sun. It is there for each and
every
one of you. Send this to others and witness the awesome power of prayer.
Also,
read Phil 4:13

A doctor was having an affair with his nurse. Shortly 
after this started, she told him she was pregnant. Not 
wanting his wife to know, he gave the nurse a large 
sum of money and asked her to go to Italy and have the 
baby there. 

"But how will I let you know the baby is born?" she 
asked. 

He replied, "Just send me a postcard and write 
'spaghetti' on the back." 

Not knowing what else to do, the nurse took the money 
and flew to Italy. Six months went by and then one day 
the doctor's wife called him at the office and 
explained, "Dear, you received a very strange postcard 
in the mail today and I don't understand what it 
means." 

The doctor said, "Just wait until I get home and read 
it and I will explain it to you." 

Later that evening the doctor came home, read the 
postcard, fell to the floor with a heart attack - and 
died. 

So the wife picked up the cord and read, "Spaghetti, 
Spaghetti, Spaghetti, Spaghetti - two with sausage and 
meatballs, two without."

Subject: Fwd: Prayer Request

   When you receive this e-mail just recite the following prayer.
That's all you have to do.  There is nothing attached.  This is the power of 
prayer at work.  Just send this to (7) people and see what happens on the 
seventh day.

      Do not break this, please.  There is no cost, but lots of rewards.
Let's continue to pray for one another.

      PRAYER::
      May today there be peace within you.  May you trust God that you are 
exactly where you are meant to be.  May you not forget the infinite 
possibilities that are born of faith.  May you use those gifts that you have 
received, and pass on the love that has been given to you.  May you be 
content knowing that you are a child of God.  Let His presence settle into 
your bones, and allow your soul the freedom to sing, dance, and to bask in 
the sun.  It is there for each and every one of you

Amen

Send this to (7) or more people and witness the awesome power of prayer.

M Deal #333292 A&B was sent to the file room to be faxed to the counterparty. 
After being faxed we are to track as sent to counterparty. This deal is not 
in the Tagg system. I  called and informed Ana Rizvi on this matter this 
morning. I checked Tagg again and this deal has not been entered at this 
time.

The Lord stood by to observe a baseball game. The Lord's team
was playing Satan's team, The Lord's team was at bat, the
score was tied zero to zero, and it was the bottom of the ninth inning
with two outs.

They continued to watch as a batter stepped up to the plate
whose name was Love. Love swung at the 1st pitch and hit a single,
because Love never fails.

The next batter was named Faith, who also got a single
because Faith works with Love.

The next batter up was named Godly Wisdom. Satan wound up
and threw the first pitch. Godly Wisdom looked it over and let it
ass.

Ball one.  Three more pitches and Godly Wisdom walked, because
Godly Wisdom never swings at what Satan throws.

The bases are loaded. The Lord then turns to Bob and told
him He was now going to bring in His star player. Up to bat
stepped Grace.

Bob said, "He sure doesn't look like much!"  Satan's whole team
relaxed when they saw Grace. Thinking he had won the game, Satan
wound up and fired his first pitch.  To the shock of everyone,
Grace hit the ball harder than anyone had ever seen.

But Satan was not worried; his center fielder let very few
get by.  He went up for the ball, but it went right through
his glove, hit him on the head and sent him crashing to the
ground; then it continued over the fence for a home run!

The Lord's team won. The Lord then asked Bob if he knew why Love,
Faith and Godly Wisdom could get on base but could not win the
game.  Bob answered that he did not know why. The Lord explained,
"If your love, faith and wisdom had won the game you would think you
had done it by yourself.  Love, faith and wisdom will get you on
base, but only MY Grace can get you home.

"My Grace is the only thing Satan cannot steal."

Subject: Enron Field/Houston Astros Tickets Announcement

As many of you know, the opening of Enron Field is quickly approaching.  
Enron Field, the new 42,000 seat retractable roof ballpark, will make its 
debut when the Astros play host to the World Champion New York Yankees on 
March 30th and 31st.  The defending American League West Champion Texas 
Rangers travel to Houston on April 1st.  The Astros open the 2000 
Championship Season on the road before playing host to the Philadelphia 
Phillies in the season opener on April 7th.

There have been numerous inquiries about how to secure tickets for Astros 
games at Enron Field.  A limited number of tickets have been allocated for 
Enron for these inaugural games.  However, we anticipate that the demand for 
tickets by employees will exceed this allocation.  In an effort to keep all 
of you informed, Astros tickets will be going on sale for the entire season 
to the general public for single-game tickets beginning this Saturday, 
January 29th at 9:00 a.m.  

 We recommend you secure personal tickets for the games of your choice 
through the traditional Astros ticket outlets listed below.  Enron will sell 
a significant portion of its allotted tickets to employees in late February; 
however, please remember that our supply of tickets is limited and will sell 
out quickly.

 March 30 vs. New York Yankees (Inaugural exhibition game)
 March 31 vs. New York Yankees
 April 1 vs. Texas Rangers
 April 7 vs. Philadelphia Phillies (Opening Day)

ADVANCED TICKET PURCHASES:
Tickets for all 84 home games, including three exhibition games, will be 
available at the Astrodome Box Office and the usual Ticketmaster outlets, 
including Houston-area Foley's, Fiesta and Kroger stores.  Those who wish to 
order by phone may do so by calling (713) 6-ASTROS.  Tickets are also 
accessible on-line at  www.astros.com and www.ticketmaster.com.

A detailed follow up e-mail will be sent to provide more information on when 
and where the Enron tickets will be sold.  In addition, Astros tickets will 
be available to Enron employees throughout the season, and we will notify you 
of these opportunities.

True Story - many of you probably already know about the pitfalls, traps, and 
predators on the internet, but this is something to consider for your 
children and families.  This story is something those of you with children 
who are home alone and/or enjoy chat rooms, talk groups, buddy lists etc 
should be aware of.  Share this with others you think would benefit.  Thanks.


>> Shannon could hear the footsteps behind her as she
>> walked toward home.  The thought of being followed
>> made her heart beat faster.  "You're being silly," she
>> told herself, "no one is following you."  To be safe,
>> she began to walk faster, but the footsteps kept up
>> with her pace.  She was afraid to look back and she
>> was glad she was almost home.
>>
>> Shannon said a quick prayer, "God please get me
>> home safe."  She saw the porch light burning and
>> ran the rest of the way to her house. Once  inside,
>> she leaned against the door for a moment, relieved
>> to be in the safety of her home. She glanced out the
>> window to see if anyone was there. The sidewalk
>> was empty. After tossing her books on the sofa, she
>> decided to grab a snack and get on-line.
>>
>> She logged on under her screen name ByAngel213.
>> She checked her Buddy List and saw GoTo123 was
>> on.  She sent him an instant message:
>>
>> ByAngel213: Hi I'm glad you are on!  I thought
>> someone was following me home today.  It was
>> really weird!
>>
>> GoTo123: LOL You watch too much TV.  Why
>> would someone be following you? Don't you live
>> in a safe neighborhood?
>>
>> ByAngel213: Of course I do.  LOL I guess it was my
>> imagination cuz' I didn't see anybody when I looked
>> out.
>>
>> GoTo123: Unless you gave your name out on-line.
>> You haven't done that have you?
>>
>> ByAngel213: Of course not.  I'm not stupid you know.
>>
>> GoTo123: Did you have a softball game after school
>> today?
>>
>> ByAngel213: Yes and we won!!
>>
>> GoTo123: That's great!  Who did you play?
>>
>> ByAngel213: We played the Hornets.  LOL.
>> Their uniforms are so gross!  They look like
>> bees. LOL
>>
>> GoTo123: What is your team called?
>>
>> ByAngel213: We are the Canton Cats.  We
>> have tiger paws on our uniforms.  They are really
>> kewl.
>>
>> GoTo123: Did you pitch?
>>
>> ByAngel213: No I play second base.  I got to go.  My
>> homework has to be done before my parents get
>> home.  I don't want them mad at me. Bye!
>>
>> GoTo123: Catch you later. Bye
>>
>> Meanwhile......
>> GoTo123 went to the member menu and began to
>> search for her profile. When it came up, he highlighted
>> it and printed it out. He took out a pen and began to
>> write down what he knew about Angel so far.
>>             Her name: Shannon
>>             Birthday: Jan. 3, 1985
>>             Age:13
>>             State where she lived: North Carolina
>>             Hobbies: softball, chorus, skating and
>>             going to the mall.
>>
>> Besides this information, he knew she lived in Canton
>> because she had just told him. He knew she stayed
>> by herself until 6:30 p.m. every afternoon until her
>> parents came home from work. He knew she played
>> softball on Thursday afternoons on the school team,
>> and the team was named the Canton Cats. Her
>> favorite number 7 was printed on her jersey. He knew
>> she was in the seventh grade at the Canton Junior
>> High School.  She had told him all this in the
>> conversations they had on-line. He had enough
>> information to find her now.
>>
>> Shannon didn't tell her parents about the incident on
>> the way home from the ball park that day. She didn't
>> want them to make a scene and stop her from walking
>> home from the softball games. Parents were always
>> overreacting and hers were the worst. It made her
>> wish she was not an only child. Maybe if she had
>> brothers and sisters, her parents wouldn't be so
>> overprotective.
>>
>> By Thursday, Shannon had forgotten about the
>> footsteps following her. Her game was in full swing
>> when suddenly she felt someone staring at her. It was
>> then that the memory came back. She glanced up
>> from her second base position to see a man watching
>> her closely. He was leaning against the fence behind
>> first base and he smiled when she looked at him. He
>> didn't look scary and she quickly dismissed the fear
>> she had felt.
>>
>> After the game, he sat on a bleacher while she talked
>> to the coach. She noticed his smile once again as
>> she walked past him.  He nodded and she smiled
>> back.  He noticed her name on the back of her shirt
>> He knew he had found her. Quietly, he walked a safe
>> distance behind her. It was only a few blocks to
>> Shannon's home, and once he saw where she lived
>> he quickly returned to the park to get his car. Now he
>> had to wait He decided to get a bite to eat until the
>> time came to go to Shannon's house.  He drove to a
>> fast food restaurant and sat there until time to make
>> his move.
>>
>> Shannon was in her room later that evening when she
>> heard voices in the living room. "Shannon, come
>> here," her father called.  He sounded upset and she
>> couldn't imagine why. She went into the room to see
>> the man from the ballpark sitting on the sofa.
>> "Sit down," her father began, "this man has just told
>> us a most interesting story about you." Shannon
>> moved cautiously to a chair across from the man
>> How could he tell her parents anything? She had
>> never seen him before today!  "Do you know who I
>> am Shannon?"  The man asked.
>>
>> "No," Shannon answered.
>>
>> "I am a police officer and your online friend, GoTo123."
>>
>> Shannon was stunned.  "That's impossible! GoTo is
>> a kid my age! He's 14 and he lives in Michigan!"
>>
>> The man smiled. "I know I told you all that, but it
>> wasn't true You see, Shannon, there are people on-
>> line who pretend to be kids; I was one of them.  But
>> while others do it to find kids and hurt them, I belong
>> to a group of parents who do it to protect kids from
>> predators. I came here to find you to teach you how
>> dangerous it is to give out too much information to
>> people on-line. You told me enough about yourself to
>> make it easy for me to find you. Your name, the
>> school you went to, the name of your ball team and
>> the position you played. The number and name on
>> your jersey just made finding you a breeze."
>>
>> Shannon was stunned.  "You mean you don't live in
>> Michigan?"
>>
>> He laughed. "No, I live in Raleigh. It made you feel safe
>> to think I was so far away, didn't it?"
>>
>> She nodded.
>>
>> "I had a friend whose daughter was like you. Only she
>> wasn't as lucky.  The guy found her and murdered her
>> while she was home alone. Kids are taught not to tell
>> anyone when they are alone, yet they do it all the time
>> on-line.  The wrong people trick you into giving out
>> information a little here and there on-line.  Before you
>> know it, you have told them enough for them to find
>> you without even realizing you have done it.  I hope
>> you've learned a lesson from this and won't do it again"
>>
>> "I won't," Shannon promised solemnly.
>>
>> "Will you tell others about this so they will be safe
>> too?"
>>
>> "It's a promise!"
>>

FRCC

 For the evening peak prices remained strong.  TLR's prevented any movement 
of power into Florida during the evening peak.  TVA was the culprit in 
calling for TLR's.  TLR's were not called off until He  22.  For He 23 and He 
24 we sold 100mw's  to FPL at $41 and $36.  For HE 1 they bought directly 
from their neighbors at $18.  FPC, JEA and TECO were flat for these hours.  
For hours 2-6 FPL was a  $15 bid.  Due to limited hourly trans. available and 
the likelihood of TLR's a short schedule sale to Florida was not possible.    
 


SERC

TLR's were still in place for the evening peak thus limiting the import of 
power into SERC from the North.  The eveving peak saw all of SOCO interfaces 
showing -0-.  Starting HE 23  the EES side of SOCO opened up with 150 mw's.  
We were able to move Cajn power into Florida staring HE 23.  We offered SOCO 
$45 for this hour and they passed on it.  Off-peak offers were in the low 
20's.  SOCO was a $16 bid.  No one would show a decent  bid for a 16-hr 
preschedule.  The guys on shift would not show a bid or offer for a 16-hr 
preschedule.  They will wait until the afternoon to start buying.  Most of 
the night guys in SERC believe that TLR's will once again be called by TVA 
starting in the afternoon.

This is a very good person to know.





[IMAGE]

Today I met  a great new friend
Who knew me right away 
It was funny how she understood 
All I had to say 

She listened  to my problems
She listened to my dreams 
We talked about love and life 
She'd been there, too, it seems 

 I never once  felt judged by her
She knew just how I felt 
She seemed to just accept me 
And all the problems I'd been dealt 

She didn't  interrupt me
Or need to have her say 
She just listened very patiently 
And didn't go away 

I wanted her  to understand
How much this meant to me 
But as I went to hug her 
Something startled me 

I put my arms  in front of me
And went to pull her nearer 
And realized that my new best friend 
Was nothing but a mirror.

True Friends are hard to come by. Your  first true friend should be yourself. 
Enjoy this poem about friendship  & pass it on to your friends.

ECAR
  
Prices for the evening peak were offered out in the high teens to low 
twenties.  Bids were in the low teens.  TLR's were called thus preventing 
power from moving down to the south.  Off-peak prices were just as ugly with 
offers in the mid teens and no one showing a bid.  PJM called for min. gen. 
for a couple of hours.  After he 23 LGEE began sending 365 mw's to TVA.  This 
was the only movement of power in Ecar per Oasis.  For Tuesday everyone will 
have hourly power to sell.  FE will have 200-300 mw's to move each hour.  No 
one had much interest in picking up a pre-schedule for Tuesday. 



MAIN

Prices in Main were a little lower than in Ecar.  Bids for the evening peak 
were in the low teens and for off peak bids were in the single digit's.  CE, 
Ameren, IP and Wepco will have hourly power to sell.  ALT bought 150 mw's on 
a preschedule for Tuesday.  They bought this preschedule from their neighbors 
in the low 20's.  They will be looking to pick up another 50 mw's beginning 
he 9.  They will be looking to pay in the low 20's again.  This was the only 
bid for a preschedule in Main.

>>Barbara was driving her six-year-old son, Benjamin,
to his piano
lesson.
>>They were late, and Barbara was beginning to think
she should
>>have canceled it.  There was always so much to do,
and Barbara, a
>>night-duty nurse at the local hospital, had recently
worked extra
shifts.
>>She was tired.  The sleet storm and icy roads added
to her tension.
>>Maybe she should turn the car around.  "Mom!" Ben
cried. "Look!" Just
>>ahead a car had lost control on a patch of ice. As
Barbara tapped the
>>brakes, the other car spun wildly rolled over, then
crashed sideways
>>into a telephone pole.
>>Barbara pulled over skidded to a stop and threw open
her
>>door. Thank goodness she was a nurse-she might be
able to help these
>>unfortunate passengers.  Then she paused.  What
about Ben?  She
couldn't
>>take him with her. Little boys shouldn't see scenes
like the one she
>>anticipated.  But was it safe to leave him alone?
What if their car
were
>>hit
>>from behind? For a brief moment Barbara considered
going on her way.
>>Someone else was sure to come along.  No!  "Ben,
honey, promise me
>>you'll stay in the car!"
>>"I will, Mommy," he said as she ran, slipping and
sliding, toward
>>the crash site. It was worse than she'd feared.  Two
girls of high
>>school age are in the car. One, the blonde on the

Please e-mail the policies that you consider too conservative.  If these 
issues affect your own personel life, then you have big problems.  Just keep 
in mind that your family lineage is very conservative.  And please remember 
that I supported G.W. "frat boy" Bush.

Hi,
This gives you some food for thought -- think before you react.
Love ya!
Barb

A Box Full of Kisses


The story goes that some time ago, a man punished his 3-year old daughter
for
wasting a roll of gold wrapping paper. Money was tight and he became
infuriated
when the child tried to decorate a box to put under the Christmas tree.
Never
the less, the little girl brought the box to her father the next morning
and
said, "This is for you Daddy". He was embarrassed by his earlier over
reaction,
but his temper flared again when he found that the box was empty. He
yelled at
her, " Don't you know when you give someone a present, there's supposed
to be
something inside it". The little girl looked at him with tears in her
eyes and
said, "Oh, Daddy, it's not empty, I blew Kisses into the box. All for
you,
Daddy" The father was crushed. He put his arms around his little girl and
begged
for her forgiveness. An accident took the life of the child only a short
time
later and it is told that man kept that gold box by his bed for many
years and
whenever he was discouraged, he would take out an imaginary kiss and
remember
the love of the child who had put it there. In a very real sense, each of
us, as
humans, have been given a gold container filled with unconditional love
and
kisses from our children, friends, family or God. There is no more
precious
possession anyone can hold.

Friends are angels who lift us to our feet when our wings have trouble
remembering how to fly.

Subject: A Man's Perspective


TO WOMEN EVERYWHERE FROM A MAN WHO'S HAD ENOUGH...

If you think you're fat, you probably are. Don't ask us. We refuse to
answer.

Learn to work the toilet seat. If it's up, put it down.

If you won't dress like the Victoria's Secret girls, don't expect us to act=
=20
like soap opera guys.

Don't cut your hair. Ever. Long hair is always more attractive than short=
=20
hair. One of the big reasons guys fear getting married is that married wome=
n=20
always cut their hair, and by then you're stuck with her.

Birthdays, Valentines, and Anniversaries are not quests to see if we can
find the perfect present yet again!

If you ask a question you don't want an answer to, expect an answer you
don't want to hear.

Sometimes, we're not thinking about you. Live with it. Don't ask us what
we're thinking about unless you are prepared to discuss such topics as
navel lint, the shotgun formation, or monster trucks.

Sunday =3D sports. It's like the full moon or the changing of the tides.
Let it be.

Shopping is not a sport, and no, we're never going to think of it that
way.

When we have to go somewhere, absolutely anything you wear is fine.
Really.

You have enough clothes.  You have too many shoes.

Crying is blackmail.

Ask for what you want. Let's be clear on this one: Subtle hints don't work.
Strong hints don't work. Really obvious hints don't work. Just say it!

No, we don't know what day it is. We never will. Mark anniversaries on
the calendar.

Peeing standing up is more difficult. We're bound to miss sometimes.

Most guys own three pairs of shoes-what makes you think we'd be any good
at choosing which pair, out of thirty, would look good with your dress?

Yes and No are perfectly acceptable answers to almost every question.

Come to us with a problem only if you want help solving it. That's what
we do. Sympathy is what your girlfriends are for.

A headache that lasts for 17 months is a problem. See a doctor.

Foreign films are best left to foreigners.

Check your oil.

It is neither in your best interest nor ours to take the quiz together.
No, it doesn't matter which quiz.

Anything we said 6 months ago is inadmissible in an argument. All comments
become null and void after 7 days.

If something we said can be interpreted two ways, and one of the ways
makes you sad or angry, we meant the other one.

Let us ogle. We're going to look anyway; it's genetic.

You can either tell us to do something OR tell us how to do something
but not both.

Whenever possible, please say whatever you have to say during
commercials..

ALL men see in only 16 colors. Peach is a fruit, not a color.

If it itches, it will be scratched.

Beer is as exciting for us as handbags are for you.

If we ask what's wrong and you say "nothing," we will act like nothing's=20
wrong. We know you're lying, but it's just not worth the hassle.

What the heck is a doily anyway?
=02=05---------------------------------------------------------------------=

para Blondi...errr  Charlie:

ogle:  mirar codiciosamente o insinuante
doily:  tapete

               From: THE BOSS
            Subject: YOURSELF
          Reference: LIFE


I am God.
Today I will be handling all of your problems.
Please remember that I do not need your help.
If life happens to deliver a situation to you that you cannot handle, do not
attempt to resolve it.  Kindly put it in the SFGTD (something for God to do)
box.
It will be addressed in My time, not yours.  Once the matter is placed into
the box, do not hold on to it.
If you find yourself stuck in traffic; don't despair. There are people in
this world for whom driving is an unheard of privilege.
Should you have a bad day at work;
Think of the man who has been out of work for years.
Should you despair over a relationship gone bad; Think of the person who has
never known what it's like to love and be loved in return.
Should you grieve the passing of another weekend; Think of the woman in dire
straits, working twelve hours a day, seven days a week to feed her children.
Should your car break down, leaving you miles away from assistance; Think of
the paraplegic who would love the opportunity to take that walk.
Should you notice a new gray hair in the mirror; Think of the cancer patient
in chemo who wishes she had hair to examine.
Should you find yourself at a loss and pondering what is life all about,
asking what is my purpose?
Be thankful. There are those who didn't live long enough to get the
opportunity.
Should you find yourself the victim of other people's bitterness, ignorance,
smallness or insecurities;
Remember, things could be worse.
You could be them!!!!
Let it go so God can do His job.

Subject: John 3:16



In the city of Chicago, one cold, dark night, a blizzard was setting in.
A
little boy was selling newspapers on the corner, the people were in and
out of
the cold. The little boy was so cold that he wasn't trying to sell many
papers. He walked up to a policeman and said,

"Mister, you wouldn't happen to know where a poor boy could find a warm
place to
sleep tonight would you?  You see, I sleep in a box up around the corner
there and down the alley and it's awful cold in there at night. Sure would be
nice to have a warm place to stay."

The policeman looked down at the little boy and said, "You go down the
street to that big white house and you knock on the door. When they come
out the door you just say John 3:16 and they will let you in."

So he did, he walked up the steps to the door, and knocked on the door
and a lady answered.  He looked up and said, "John 3:16."

The lady said "Come on in, Son." She took him in and she sat him down in
a split bottom rocker in front of a great big old fireplace and she went off.

He sat there for a while, and thought to himself "John 3:16....  I don't
understand it, but it sure makes a cold boy warm."

Later she came back and asked him "Are you hungry?" He said, "Well, just
a little. I haven't eaten in a couple of days and I guess I could stand a
little bit of food."

The lady took him in the kitchen and sat him down to a table full of
wonderful food. He ate and ate until he couldn't eat any more. Then he
thought to himself "John 3:16... Boy, I sure don't understand it, but it
sure makes a hungry boy full."

She took him upstairs to a bathroom to a huge bathtub filled with warm
water and he sat there and soaked for a while. As he soaked, he thought
to himself, "John 3:16... I sure don't understand it, but it sure makes a
dirty boy
clean. You know, I've not had a bath, a real bath, in my whole life.  The
only
bath I ever had was when I stood in front of that big old fire hydrant as
they flushed it out."

The lady came in and got him, and took him to a room and tucked him into
a big
old feather bed and pulled the covers up around his neck and kissed him
goodnight and turned out the lights. As he laid in the darkness and
looked out
the window at the snow coming down on that cold night he thought to
himself,
"John 3:16... I don't understand it, but it sure makes a tired boy rested."

The next morning she came back up and took him down again to that same
big table full of food. After he ate she took him back to that same big
old split bottom rocker in front of the fireplace and she took a big old
Bible and
sat down in front of him and she looked up at and she asked, "Do you
understand John 3:16?"

He said, "No, Ma'am, I don't. The first time I ever heard it was last
night when the policeman told me to use it."

She opened the Bible to John 3:16 , and she began to explain to him
about Jesus. Right there in front of that big old fireplace he gave his
heart
and life to Jesus. He sat there and thought, "John 3:16. I don't
understand it, but it but it sure makes a lost boy feel safe."

You know, I have to confess I don't understand it either, how God would
be willing to send His Son to die for me, and how Jesus would agree to do
such a
thing. I don't understand it either, but it sure does make life worth living..

Author Unknown

John 3:16
16.  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son,
that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting
life..

17.  For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but
that the world through him might be saved.

18.  He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth
not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the
only
begotten Son of God.

SERC

Evening peak prices remained strong until he 22.  OPC was a low 40's bid 
untill he 22.  We prescheduled 100 mw's to SOCO for $95 from he 20-22.  SCEG, 
DUKE  and SC were low 40's bids for the evening peak.  CPL was the only 
reasonable offer at $60.   TLR's prevented any new schedules from being 
started until he 23.    Off- peak bids were in the low to mid teen's.  SOCO 
was buying $15 from their neighbor's.  Vepco offered out $14.00 into TVA or 
into EES for off-peak.  This power ended up being sold to EES.  EES would not 
show us a bid for off-peak.   For Wednesday SOCO and SCEG will be buying 
hourly after the morning peak.  Duke and Vepco will be buying for economics.  
SOCO did not want to pre-schedule anything for Wednesday.  

 SERC    16 hour average:  BID  $ 50  OFFER $ 80


FRCC

Bids were not very strong in Florida for the evening peak.   Rain helped the 
Florida utilities cover their loads.  For he 21-22 TAL, FPL and FPC were mid 
40's to mid 50's bids for the evening peak.  The only offer for the evening 
peak was a $100 offer from FPL.   For off-peak, bids were in the mid teens, 
there was no real interest in buying off-peak.   FPC and FP&L  will wait 
until mid morning to look for preschedules.  
  
        
 FRCC   16 hour average:  BID  $ 90  OFFER $ 150

===== 
>> I have in my hands two boxes which God gave me to hold 
>> > He said, "Put all your sorrows in the black, 
>> > And all your joys in the gold." 
>> > I heeded His words, and in the two boxes 
>> > Both my joys and sorrows I stored 
>> > But though the gold became heavier each day 
>> > The black was as light as before 
>> > With curiosity, I opened the black 
>> > I wanted to find out why 
>> > And I saw, in the base of the box, a hole 
>> > Which my sorrows had fallen out 
>> > I showed the hole to God, and mused aloud, 
>> > "I wonder where my sorrows could be." 
>> > He smiled a gentle smile at me." 
>> > "My child, they're all here with me." 
>> > I asked, "God, why give me the boxes, 
>> > Why the gold, and the black with the hole?" 
>> > "My child, the gold is for you to count your 
>> > blessings, The black is for you to let go." 
>> > We should consider all of our friends a  blessing.

      ON A POSITIVE NOTE:
      On a positive note I've learned that no matter what happens,
or how bad
      it
      seems today,
      life does go on, and it will be better  tomorrow.  I've
learned that you
      can
      tell a
      lot about a person by the way he/she handles these three
things: a rainy

      day, lost
      luggage, and tangled Christmas tree lights. I've learned
that regardless
      of
      your
            relationship with your parents, you'll miss
them when they're gone from your life.
            I've learned that making a "living" is not
the same thing as making a "life."
            I've learned that life sometimes gives you a
second chance. I've learned
      that you
      shouldn't go through life with a catcher's mitt on both
hands. You need
      to
      be able to
            throw something back.  I've learned that if
you pursue happiness, it will elude you.
            But if you focus on your family, your
friends, the needs of others, your
      work and doing
      the very best you can, happiness will find you. I've learned
that
      whenever I
      decide
      something with an open heart, I usually make the right
decision. I've
      learned that even
      when I have pains, I don't have to be one.  I've learned
that every day
      you
      should
      reach out and touch someone.  People love that human touch,
holding
      hands, a
      warm hug,
            or just a friendly pat on the back. I've
learned that I still have a lot to learn.
      I've learned that you should pass this on to someone you
care about. I
      just
      did. Sometimes
      they just need a little something to make them smile.


            Note: people will forget what you said,
people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made
them feel.

Subject: Re: Fwd: Morning Blessing

You guys don't have to send this back to me because I know some of you don't 
have time, but I know you will ask the Lord to bless me anyway.  I am sending 
this to you because I think it is a nice prayer.  Let's keep each other in 
our prayers.

Love ya,

?? MORNING BLESSING
    I asked the Lord to bless you,
    As I prayed for you today.
??  To guide you and protect you,
    As you go along your way.
    His love is always with you,
    His promises are true,
    And when we give Him all our cares,
 ?? We know He'll see us through.
    So when the road you're traveling on
  ? Seems difficult at best,
    Just remember I'm here praying
    And God will do the rest.



 Forward this to at least 10 people whom you want God to bless and,
 don't forget to send it back to the one who asked God to bless you
 first.

 Subject: Empty Bird Cage
 
 There once was a man named George Thomas, a pastor in a small New
 England town. One Easter Sunday morning he came to Church carrying a
 rusty,bent,old bird cage and set it by the pulpit.  Several eyebrows were
 raised and, as if in response, Pastor Thomas began to speak...
 "I was walking through town yesterday when I saw a young boy
 coming  toward me swinging this birdcage. On the bottom of the cage were 
three
 little wild birds, shivering with cold and fright. I stopped the lad and
 asked, 'What you got there, son?'"
 "Just some old birds", came the reply.
 "What are you gonna do with them?" I asked.
 "Take 'em home and have fun with 'em," he answered. "I'm gonna
 tease 'em and pull out their feathers to make 'em fight. I'm gonna have a
 real good time." "But you'll get tired of those birds sooner or later. What
 will you do?"
 "Oh, I got some cats," said the boy -- "They like birds. I'll
  take'em to them."
  The Pastor was silent for a moment. "How much do you want
  for the birds, son?"
  "Huh??!!!   Why, you don't want them birds, mister. They're just
  plain old field birds. They don't sing -- they ain't even pretty!"
 "How much?" the pastor asked again.
  The boy sized up the pastor as if he were crazy and said, "$10,"
  The pastor reached in his pocket and took out a ten-dollar bill.
  He placed it in the boys hand. In a flash, the boy was gone.
  The pastor picked up the cage and gently carried it to the end of
  the alley where there was a tree and a grassy spot. Setting the cage
  down, he opened the door, and by softly tapping the bars he persuaded 
birds                       out, setting them free.
 
 Well, that explained the empty birdcage on the pulpit, and then
 the pastor began to tell this story....
 One day Satan and Jesus were having a conversation. Satan had just
 come from the Garden of Eden, and he was gloating and boasting.
 "Yes sir, I just caught the world full of people down there.  Set
 me a trap, used bait I knew they couldn't resist. Got 'em all!!"
 "What are you going to do with them?" Jesus asked.
 
 Satan replied, "Oh, I'm gonna have fun. I'm gonna teach them how
 to marry and divorce each other, how to hate and abuse each other, how to
 drink and smoke and curse. I'm gonna teach them how to invent guns and bombs
 and kill each other. I'm really gonna have fun!!"
 And what will you do when you get done with them?" Jesus asked.
 "Oh I'll kill 'em," Satan glared proudly.
 "How much do you want for them?" Jesus asked.
 Oh, you don't want those people. They ain't no good. Why, you'll
 take them and they'll just hate you. They'll spit on you, curse you and kill
 you!!   
 You don't want those people".
 "How much??" Jesus asked again.
 Satan looked at Jesus and sneered, "All your tears, and all your
 blood."
 Jesus said, 'DONE." Then he paid the price.
 The pastor picked up the cage, opened the door and walked from the
 pulpit.

The government recently calculated the cost of raising a child from birth
to
18 and came up with $160,140.00 for a middle-income family.  Talk about
sticker shock. That doesn't even touch college tuition. For those with
kids,
that figure leads to wild fantasies about all the things we could have
bought, all the places we could have traveled, all the money we could have
banked if not for (insert child's name here).  For others, that number
might
confirm the decision to remain childless.

But $160,140.00 isn't so bad if you break it down. It translates into
$8,896.66 a year, $741.38 a month or $171.08 a week. That's a mere $24.44 a
day.  Just over a dollar an hour. Still, you might think the best financial
advice says don't have children if you want to be rich.

It's just the opposite.  There's no way to put a price tag on:
Feeling a new life move for the first time and seeing the bump of a knee
rippling across your skin. Having someone cry, "It's a boy!" or shout,
"It's
a girl!" then hearing the baby wail and knowing all that matters is it's
healthy. Counting all 10 fingers and toes for the first time.  Feeling the
warmth of fat cheeks against your breast. Cupping an entire head in the
palm
of your hand. Making out dada or mama from all the cooing and gurgling.

What do you get for your $160,140.00?
Naming rights. First, middle and last.
Glimpses of God every day.
Giggles under the covers every night.
More love than your heart can hold.
Butterfly kisses and Velcro hugs.
Endless wonder over rocks, ants, clouds and warm cookies.
A hand to hold, usually covered with jam.
A partner for blowing bubbles, flying kites, building sandcastles and
skipping down the sidewalk in the pouring rain.  Someone to laugh yourself
silly with no matter what the boss said or how your stocks performed that
day.

For $160,140.00, you never have to grow up.  You get to finger-paint, carve
pumpkins, play hide-and-seek, catch lightning bugs and never stop believing
in Santa Clause.  You have an excuse to keep reading the adventures of
Piglet and Pooh, watching Saturday morning cartoons, going to Disney movies
and wishing on stars.

You get to frame rainbows, hearts and flowers under refrigerator magnets
and
collect spray-painted noodle wreaths for Christmas, hand prints set in clay
for Mother's Day and cards with backward letters for Father's Day.

For $160,140.00, there's no greater bang for your buck.  You get to be a
hero just for retrieving a Frisbee off the garage roof, taking the training
wheels off the bike, removing a sliver, filling the wading pool, coaxing a
wad of gum out of bangs and coaching a baseball team that never wins but
always gets treated to ice cream regardless.

You get a front-row seat to history; to witness the first step, first word,
first bra, first date, first time behind the wheel.  You get to be
immortal.
You get another branch added to your family tree, and if you're lucky, a
long list of limbs in your obituary called grandchildren.

You get an education in psychology, nursing, criminal justice,
communications and human sexuality no college can match.  In the eyes of a
child, you rank right up there with God.  You have the power to heal a
boo-boo, scare away monsters under the bed, patch a broken heart, police a
slumber party, ground them forever and love them without limits, so one day
they will, like you, love without counting the cost.

A VISITORS' GUIDE TO HOUSTON, TX

(To enable our many visitors to cope with life in
America's Fourth
Largest
City)

1. First you must learn to pronounce the city name. It
is YEWS-TUN and
it
does not matter how people pronounce it in other
places.

2. Forget the traffic rules you learned elsewhere.
Houston has its own
version of traffic rules. Never forget that downtown
Houston is
composed
entirely of one way streets. The only way to get out
of center of town
is to
turn around and start over when you reach Dallas,
Texas.

3. All directions start with, "Go down Westheimer..."

4. Westheimer has no beginning and no end.

5. It's impossible to go around a block and wind up on
the street you
started on. The Chamber of Commerce calls this a
"scenic drive".

6. The 8am rush hour is from 6:30 to 9:30am. The
5:00pm rush hour is
from
3:30 to 6:30pm. Friday's rush hour starts on Thursday
morning.

7. If you actually stop at a yellow light, you cannot
be from Houston.

8. Reversible Lanes are not understood by anybody.

9. Kuykendahl Road can only be pronounced by a native,
so do not
attempt the
phonetic pronunciation. People will simply tilt their
heads to the
right and
stare at you.

10. The falling of one raindrop or (God forbid) one
snowflake causes
all
traffic to immediately cease; so will daylight savings
time and a girl
applying eye shadow across the street, or a flat tire
three lanes over.

11. Construction on the Gulf Freeway is a way of life,
and a permanent
form
of entertainment.

12. Many bizarre sights can be explained simply by
uttering the
phrase,"Oh, we're in Montrose!!"

13. Construction crews aren't doing their job properly
unless they
close
down all lanes except one during rush hour.

14. If someone actually has their turn signal on, it
was probably left
on at
the factory where the car was made.

15. Understand that the 95 pound woman driving the
Ford Excursion (the
largest vehicle ever produced) absolutely MUST come to
a complete stop,
then
proceed at 2.5 mph over any railroad track. What's the
deal? This
vehicle
was built to invade small countries, and she's worried
about the
railroad
tracks!!!

16. All ladies with blue hair who drive Cadillacs or
Lincoln
Continentals have the right of way.

17. The above mentioned blue haired ladies also have a
legal right to
turn
right from a left lane or to turn left from a right
lane. YOU HAVE BEEN
WARNED!

18. White haired men driving red or silver sports cars
will not
obey any known traffic rule and cannot be expected to
stop for red
lights or
stop signs.

19. Buying a Houston street map is a waste of money
since there is
absolutely no way that you can route yourself in such
a manner as to
avoid
major road construction.

20. Buying a Houston street map is a waste of money
since the
termination or continuation of any street is entirely
at the discretion
of
the Streets Department of the City. It has been
determined that the
length
of any street on any given day is a mystery known only
to "Higher
Powers" in
the department, and it is rumored that they do not
speak to mere
mortals.

21. Asking directions will help you get acquainted
with the numerous
recent
residents of an amazing ethnic diversity. It will be
not help at all
for
finding the address you seek.

22. If searching for a street on the southwest side of
Houston, a
knowledge of Chinese, Korean, or Vietnamese is
somewhere between
helpful and
mandatory, since the street signs are printed in one
of these languages
along with English. However, often the English name
for the street has
been
removed.

23. Houston natives are so rare that they are listed
on the endangered
species list. The few remaining specimens are kept in
a controlled
environment for their own safety.

24 . "Sir" and "Ma'am" are used by the person speaking
to you if
there's a
remote possibility that you're at least 30 minutes
older than they are.
You
can safely address anyone as "Sir" or "Ma'am" in
Houston as in other
southern cities.

25 . "Sugar" is a more common form of address than
"Miss". So is
"Honey" Do
not take offence. This is how southerners address
grown women.

26 . In Houston we drink Coca Cola and Dr. Pepper. It
is rumored that
other
soft drinks are sold here, but no one will admit to
knowing anyone who
actually drinks them. So don't ask for any other soft
drink.

27 . What you need to know when arriving at Bush
Intercontinental
Airport:
Your arrival gate is at least 32 miles away from the
Main Concourse of
any
terminal. Walking heels on your boots or walking shoes
are advised.

28 . Wherever you are going will be on the other side
of town. When
attempting to cross Houston, assume the trip will take
a minimum of 4
hours
and can take as long as 24 hours.

29 . If attempting to cross Houston via the freeway
system, it is
advisable to carry a supply of Coca Cola, water, a few
sandwiches, and
something to read while waiting on the freeway for the
traffic jam to
clear.
Some moderately fast readers have been known to read a
1,000 page novel
during the course of one traffic jam. If attempting to
cross Houston
during
rush hour,
additional provisions are advisable.

30 . Never get on a Houston freeway without taking a
restroom break
first!
It may be a long time to the next break.

31 . Never honk your horn at another car in Houston
traffic. The
bumpersticker that reads, "Keep honking, I'm
reloading" is considered
fair
warning.

Attached is everything that you would want to know about our customer outing
this week.  If anyone has any problems with hotel rooms or anything else,
let me know.  Those of you that are coming in on Thursday, please make sure
that you have told the Sheraton on Highway 280 so they will hold your room
for Thursday night.  Please pass this information along to your co-workers
that are coming because I did not have everyone's e-mail.  The golf course
is over an hour away from the golf course that we are playing at so allow
plenty of time to return for those of you that are returning home Thursday
evening.  We will understand if you have to leave early but we should be
O.K.

We do have to see the Confirmation Letter if the Counterparty has made any 
changes what so ever, including strike throughs or trader name changes.

Subject: Love Ya!

Did Anyone Ever Tell You,
Just How Special You Are
The Light that You Emit
Might even Light a Star

Did Anyone Ever Tell You
How Important You Make Others Feel
Somebody out here is Smiling
About Love that is so Real

Did Anyone Ever Tell You
Many Times, When They were Sad
Your E-mail made Them Smile a bit
In Fact It made Them Glad

For the Time You Spend Sending Things
And Sharing whatever You Find
There are No Words to Thank You
But Somebody, Thinks You're Fine

Did Anyone Ever Tell You
Just How Much They Love You
Well,  My Dearest " Online "  Friend
Today I am Telling You

 ++++++++++++++++++

I HOPE I GET THIS BACK

I believe that without a friend
you are missing out on a lot!!!
Don't be confused by friends and
acquaintances, there is a difference!

Because I care about you,

It's national care week . . .
and you get to send messages to 
all your friends telling them 
that you care about them and 
make them feel good about
themselves and if they write
back . . . (just once)
then that means that they care
about you too.

BUT, you have to send it right now!!
Send it to everyone you care
about and if they send it back . . . 
that means they care too.
but don't just send it back,
send it on to everyone..

Have a nice day, and I'm glad we
are friends!!!

 Subject: Some armor for the daily battles of life


The only survivor of a shipwreck was washed up on a small, uninhabited 
island.  He prayed feverishly for God to rescue him, and every day he scanned 
the horizon for help, but none seemed forthcoming.  Exhausted, he eventually 
managed to build a little hut out of driftwood to protect himself from the 
elements, and to store his few possessions.  But then one day, after 
scavenging for food, he arrived home to find his little hut in flames, the 
smoke rolling up to the sky. The worst had happened; everything was lost. He 
was stunned with grief and anger.  "God, how could you do this to me!" he 
cried.  Early the next day, however, he was awakened by the sound of a ship 
that was approaching the island. It had come to rescue him.  "How did you 
know I was here?" asked the weary man of his rescuers.  "We saw your smoke 
signal," they replied.

It is easy to get discouraged when things are going bad. But we shouldn't 
lose heart, because God is at work in our lives, even in the midst of pain 
and suffering. Remember, next time your little hut is burning to the ground-- 
it just may be a smoke signal that summons the grace of God.  For all the 
negative things we have to say to ourselves, God  has a positive answer for 
it:

You say: "It's impossible"   --   God says:"All thing are possible" 
(Luke18:27)
You say: "I'm too tired"  --  God says:"I will give you rest" ( Matt11:28-20)
You say: "Nobody really loves me" -- God says:"I love you" (John 3:16 & 
John13:34)
You say: "I can't go on"  --  God says:"My grace is sufficient" (II Cor.12:9 
& Psalm 91:15)             You say: "I can't figure things out" -- God 
says:"I will direct your steps" (Proverbs 3:5-6)
You say: "I can't do it" -- God says:"You can do all things" (Phil 4:13)
You say: "I'm not able" -- God says:"I am able" (II Cor.9:8)
You say:"It's not worth it"  --  God says:"It will be worth it" (Romans 8:28)
You say: "I can't forgive myself"  --  God says:"I forgive you" ( I John 1:9 
& Romans 8:1)
You say: "I can't manage"  -- God says:"I will supply all your needs" (Phil 
4:19)
You say: "I'm afraid"  -- God says:"I have not given you a spirit of fear (II 
Tim. 1:7)
You say: "I'm always worried and frustrated"  --  God says:"Cast all your 
cares on ME" ( I Peter 5:7)
You say: "I don't have enough faith" -- God says: I've given everyone a 
measure of faith (Rom. 12:3)
You say: "I'm not smart enough"  -- God says "I give you wisdom (I Cor 1:30)
You say: "I feel all alone" -- God says:"I will never leave you or forsake 
you" (Heb. 13:5)

Pass this on, you never know whose life may be in need of this today.  I

Subject: FW: You will get a very pleasant surprise.

This is a very nice story.  You never know when Jesus will visit you so 
always be willing to give.  I don't consider this to be a chain letter, I 
just like the story and I thought you would too.


Ruth went to her mail box and there was only one letter.  She picked it
up and looked at it before opening, but then  she looked at the envelope
again. There was no stamp, no postmark, only her name and address.  She
read the letter:

Dear Ruth:

I'm going to be in your neighborhood Saturday afternoon and I would like
to visit.

Love Always,
Jesus

Her hands were shaking as she placed the letter on the table.   "Why
would the Lord want to visit me?   I'm nobody special.  I don't have
anything to offer."   With that thought,  Ruth remembered her empty
kitchen cabinets. "Oh my  goodness,  I really don't have anything to
offer.  I'll have to run down  to the store and buy something for
dinner."  She reached for her purse and counted out it's contents.
Five dollars and forty cents. "Well, I can get some bread and cold cuts,
at least."   She threw on her coat and hurried out the door. A loaf of
french bread, a half-pound of sliced turkey, and a carton of
milk...leaving Ruth with grand total of twelve cents to last her until
Monday.   Nonetheless, she felt good as she headed home, her meager
offerings tucked under her arm."Hey lady, can you help us, lady?"  Ruth
had been so absorbed in her dinner plans, she hadn't even noticed two
figures huddled in the alleyway. A man and a woman, both of them dressed
in little more than rags.   "Look lady, I ain't got a job, ya know, and
my wife and I have been living  out here  on the street, and, well, now
it's getting cold and  we're getting kinda hungry and, well, if you
could help us, lady, we'd really appreciate it." Ruth looked at them
both.  They were dirty, they smelled bad and frankly, she was certain
that they could get some kind of work if they really wanted to.  "Sir,
I'd like to help  you, but I'm a poor woman myself.  All I have is a few
cold cuts  and  some  bread, and I'm having an important guest for
dinner  tonight  and  I was planning on serving that to Him." "Yeah,
well, okay lady, I understand.  Thanks anyway."  The man put his arm
around the woman's shoulders,  turned and  he headed back into the
alley.  As she watched them leave, Ruth felt a familiar twinge in her
heart.  "Sir, wait!"   The couple stopped and turned as she ran down the
alley after them.  "Look, why don't you take this food.  I'll figure out
something  else to serve my  guest."  She handed the man her grocery bag
"Thank you lady. Thank you very much!"  "Yes, thank you!" It was the
man's wife, and Ruth could see now that she  was shivering. "You know,
I've got another coat at home.  Here, why don't you take this one."
Ruth unbuttoned her jacket and slipped it over the woman's shoulders.
Then smiling, she turned and walked back to the street...without her
coat and with nothing to serve her guest.

"Thank you lady! Thank you very much!"

Ruth was chilled by the time she reached her front door, and worried
too. The Lord was coming to visit and she didn't have anything to offer
Him.  She fumbled through her purse for the door key.   But as she did,
she noticed another envelope in her mailbox.  "That's odd.  The mailman
doesn't usually come twice in one day."   She took the envelope out of
the box and opened it.

Dear Ruth:

It was so good to see you again.  Thank you for  the lovely meal. And
thank you, too, for the beautiful coat.

Love Always,
Jesus

The air was still cold, but even without her coat, Ruth no  longer
noticed.

If you love Jesus, send this to ten people.   Do not keep this message.

The mantra must leave your hands within 96  hours. You will get a very
pleasant surprise.

The Biggest Mathematical Miracle in the World!

Moses and his people were in the desert, but
what was he going to do with them?
They had to be fed, and fed is what he did,
according to the Quartermaster General in the
Army.  It is reported that Moses would have to have
had 1500 tons of food each day.

Do you know that to bring that much food each
day, two freight trains, each a mile long,  would be required!
Besides you must remember, they were out in the desert, so they
would have to have firewood to use in cooking the food.
This would take 4000 tons of wood and a few
more  freight trains, each a mile long,  just for one day.

And just think, they were forty years in transit.
And oh yes! They would have to have water. If they
only had enough to drink and wash a few dishes,
it would take 11,000,000 gallons each day, and a
freight train with tank cars, 1800 miles long, just to bring water!

And then another thing! They had to get across
the Red Sea at night. (They did?) Now, if they went on
a narrow path, double file, the line would be 800
miles long and would require 35 days and  nights
to get through. So, there had to be a space in the Red Sea,
3 miles  wide so that they could walk 5000 abreast to get
over in one night.

But then, there is another problem. Each time
they camped at the end of  the day, a campground
two-thirds the size of the state of Rhode Island was
required, or a total of 750 square miles
long...think of  it! This space just for nightly camping.

Do you think Moses figured all this out
before he left Egypt?

I think not!

You see, Moses believed in God.

God took care of these things for him.

Now do you think God has any problem taking
care of all your needs?
I ASKED THE LORD TO BLESS YOU.......
I asked the Lord to bless you As I prayed for you today,
To guide you and protect you As you go along your way....
His love is always with you,
His promises are true,
And when we give Him all our cares,
You know He will see us through.
So when the road you're traveling on
Seems difficult at best,
Just remember I'm here praying
And God will do the rest.

Pass this to at least 10 people you want God to bless, don't
forget to send it back to the one who asked
God to bless you first.
A POSITIVE  ATTITUDE CAUSES A CHAIN REACTION OF
POSITIVE THOUGHTS, EVENTS  AND OUTCOMES!!

"I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me."
              -Philippians 4:13

>THE HAND
>--------------------------------
>My daughter, Kathleen, was 15... too young to seriously date but she had
>a boyfriend. One evening, when I was leaving to pick up my son, Paul,
>from baseball practice, she asked if she could just go with her
>boyfriend to pick up his little brother at a friend's house. She said
>they would come right back.
>I said, "All right, just make sure you wear your seat belt, and come
>right home." It was my father's birthday and my youngest
>daughter,Therese, was already at my father's house waiting for us to
>come over with the cake I had yet to pick up at the store. I left to
>pick Paul up at school, but decided to take the highway, rather than the
>shortcut along the back roads.
>After leaving the school, Paul and I ran in the store for the cake and
>some last minute goodies. As we were getting into the car, we heard and
>saw paramedics, fire trucks, three ambulances and of course a multitude
>of police cars. ? I got a sick feeling in my stomach and said to Paul,
>"Somebody needs our prayers, quick." ? I wondered if there was a fire
>or a bad car accident.
>At one of the intersections I had to stop to let more emergency vehicles
>through, and prayed, "Lord, those people need you right now, go to them
>and place your protective hand over them."
>We stopped at my parents to drop off the food, before going home to pick
>up Kathleen, but my father met me at the car and told us to postpone the
>Party because Therese had fallen asleep.
>"Which way did you go to the school?" he asked, "Because there was a bad
>accident on the back road, I heard someone was killed. It happened just
>about the time you had to pick up Paul at the school and I know you
>always go that way. I was so happy to see you pull in, I had a gut
>feeling it was you."
>As Paul and I drove the short distance home, I could see our house was
>dark and when Kathleen is home alone, she always burned every light. As
>I turned off the ignition, tears fell, "It was Kathleen," I told Paul,
>"I know it." I ran in the house and checked our answering machine, no
>one
>had called. I breathed a sigh of relief, thinking that someone would
>have called by now. "Paranoid," that's what Kathleen always called me,
>and that's what I was telling myself, "You're just paranoid!" Then, the
>phone rang. It was her friend's mother, who worked in the emergency room
>of our local hospital. She only told me that the three of them were in
>an accident and were being transported to the hospital.
>I didn't call my husband at work, or my parents. Paul and I just left
>for the hospital. As I pulled into the parking lot, one of the
>paramedics, someone we have known for years met us at our car.
>"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry," he said with tears streaming down his face.
>????The next thing I remember after was talking to the doctor in
>the hallway of the ER.
>He asked me if I believed in God, and with that my knees gave way.
>"No," he said, "you don't understand, do you believe in divine
>intervention? "I stammered, a weak, "Yes." ? Not having a clue what he
>was talking about. ? He smiled at me and asked, "Do you know what
>shirt your daughter was wearing, tonight?" Nodding no, he told me to go
>down the hall and look. "Your daughter is blessed with angels and so are
>you.
>From what the emergency personnel told me, there is no way that your
>daughter should be alive, let alone only have a few scratches." Kathleen
>was laying on a cart, waiting for more x-rays. When I got to her, we
>both sobbed. As I was hugging her I had the urge to check her shirt,
>unzipping her jacket. I read the words, "Jesus Saves." I knew then, what
>the doctor had meant.
>All three were treated and released. On the way home that night,
>Kathleen told this story: "It was really weird, about a quarter of a
>mile before the accident, I said, 'Wait, we forgot to put our seatbelts
>on, my Mother will kill me.' Then a car was coming towards us in our
>lane, he swerved, and I knew we got hit on the passenger side of the
>car, where I was sitting. We got hit a total of three times because the
>car kept spinning in a circle. I felt his little brother's hand on my
>shoulder, holding me lightly in place.
>"But Mom, after it was all over, I could still feel the hand on my
>shoulder. I looked and his little brother had flown out the back window
>of the car, as we later found out, on the first spin. "It was an
>angel,Mom,I know it!"
>I knew it too, especially when we went the next day to look at the car,
>it had been split in half, right underneath my daughter's seat. The
>driver of the other car, witnesses said, was traveling 90-95 miles Per
>hour and the point of impact at that speed was directly at Kathleen's
>door. The police report stated that the car door was found fifty feet
>away from the accident scene, with the seat belt attached. So when the
>door broke loose, "the hand" was the only thing that saved my daughter's
>life.
>The Lord, knew, long before I did that my child was in trouble, and I
>will always praise Him for saving her life and restoring mine. I have
>been meaning to write this story for the past couple years. ? Kathleen
>just turned 21. While I was writing this I smiled and cried, it's all
>true.
>
>
>
>Father, I ask you to bless my friend reading this right now!
>
>Lord, show them a new revelation of Your love and power.
>
>Holy Spirit, I ask You to minister to their spirit at this very moment.
>
>Where there is pain, give them Your peace & mercy.
>
>Where there is self-doubting, release a renewed confidence in Your
>ability to work through them.
>
>Where there is tiredness, or exhaustion, I ask You to give them
>understanding, patience, & strength as they learn submission to Your

>
>Where there is spiritual stagnation, I ask You to renew them by

>
>Where there is fear, reveal Your love, and release to them Your courage.

>Where there is a sin blocking them, reveal it, and break its hold over

>
>Bless their finances, give them greater vision, and raise up leaders,

>Give each of them discernment to recognize the demonic forces around

>I ask You to do these things in Jesus'name!
>In Christian love,

Subject: hourly checkout AECI HE 9 from 5-3-01

Kurt at AECI showed AECI purchasing 96 mws at $38 for HE 9.  The P&L showed 
this deal at $40.  I offered to meet in the middle at $39.  Kurt preferred to 
pull the tapes and review the deal with his day guy that did the deal.  This 
is a heads up on the situation.

TLR's were again the story in SERC.  TLR's were not lifted until 1:00 a.m.  
We could not move anything from ECAR into SERC.  This was not the case for 
the AEP marketers, TVA trans. made a mistake by allowing a new schedule to be 
started with an AEP to SOCO sink.  TVA admitted this mistake to us.   OPC and 
SOCO were the strongest bid across the evening peak.  OPC was an $80 bid for 
he 20.  SOCO was a $60 bid across the evening peak.  SCEG was the only other 
bid during the evenng peak and he was trying to buy under his gas units.  
VEPCO was a $50 offer, unfortunately, VEPCO was a bad source for SOCO and 
OPC.  For off-peak OPC was the strongest bid for he23 and 24.  We sold them 
$24 for he 24.  We also sold $15.50's to SOCO  for he 2-6.   CPL was the only 
 offer at $19.50.  SOCO had no offer for off-peak, they had to much 
maintenance to offer anything out.  For Thursday  SOCO, OPC and SCEG will 
again be buying hourly after the morning peak.  DUKE, CPL and VEPCO will have 
hourly to sell tomorrow.    

 SERC    16 hour average:  BID  $ 43.9  OFFER $ 60.2


FRCC

After the preschedule we sold FPC through he 19,  FPC was a $50 bid.   FPL 
would not show a bid for he 20.  FPL was a $70 offer beginning he 21.  FPL 
was the only offer for across the evening peak.  FPL showed $140 for he 20.  
FPL began  selling $60-$70 to SOCO for he 21-22.  Off-peak was the same as 
yesterday with bids in the mid teens,  there was no real interest in buying 
off-peak.   FPC and FP&L  will again be on the bid for b.o.d. schedules.

Subject: Fwd: Prayer Request

   When you receive this e-mail just recite the following prayer.
That's all you have to do.  There is nothing attached.  This is the power of 
prayer at work.  Just send this to (7) people and see what happens on the 
seventh day.

      Do not break this, please.  There is no cost, but lots of rewards.
Let's continue to pray for one another.

      PRAYER::
      May today there be peace within you.  May you trust God that you are 
exactly where you are meant to be.  May you not forget the infinite 
possibilities that are born of faith.  May you use those gifts that you have 
received, and pass on the love that has been given to you.  May you be 
content knowing that you are a child of God.  Let His presence settle into 
your bones, and allow your soul the freedom to sing, dance, and to bask in 
the sun.  It is there for each and every one of you

Amen

Send this to (7) or more people and witness the awesome power of prayer.

Subject: Best Education Money Can't Buy

Below are some "points to ponder" that will help anyone with the daily 
challenges we face getting through life, and choosing to enjoy life rather 
than just going through the paces.

 And, it most cases, this type of wisdom will do more for our lives than any 
degree could. 
                     From one who is "still learning"...... 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------

I Have Learned...
  I've  learned....
         that the best  classroom in the world
         is at the  feet of an elderly person.

  I've  learned....
         that when you're in  love, it shows.

  I've  learned....
        that just one person  saying to me,
         "You've made my  day!" makes my day.

 I've  learned....
        that I feel better  about myself when
         I make others  feel better about themselves.

  I've  learned....
         that having a child  fall asleep in your
         arms is one of  the most peaceful
         feelings in the  world.

  I've  learned....
         that what we have done  for ourselves
        alone dies with us.  What we have done
         for others and  the world remains and
         is  immortal.

  I've  learned....
         that one sincere  apology is worth more
         than all the  roses money can buy.

  I've  learned....
         that words harshly  spoken are as difficult
         to  retrieve as feathers in a gale.

 I've  learned....
         that being kind is  more important than
         being  right.

 I've  learned....
         that you should never  say no to a
        gift from a  child.
  I've  learned....
        that I can always pray  for someone when
         I don't have the  strength to help him
        in some other  way.

  I've learned....
          that no matter how serious your  life
         requires you to be, everyone  needs a
         friend to act goofy  with.

 I've  learned....
        that sometimes all a  person needs is a
        hand to hold and  a heart to understand.

 I've  learned....
         that simple walks with  my father around
        the block on  summer nights when I was
         a child  did wonders for me as an adult.

 I've  learned....
         that life is like a  roll of toilet paper.
         The closer  it gets to the end, the
         faster it  goes.

 I've  learned....
         that we should be glad  God doesn't
         give us everything we  ask for.

 I've  learned....
         that money doesn't buy  class.

 I've  learned....
         that it's those small  daily happenings
         that make life so  spectacular.

 I've  learned....
         that once a  relationship is over,
        if you  experienced more smiles than
          tears, then it wasn't a waste of time.

 I've  learned....
        that under everyone's  hard shell is
         someone who wants to  be appreciated
         and  loved.

  I've  learned....
         never to humiliate  another person.
         Always give him an  honorable way to
         back down or out  of something and
         still save  face.

  I've  learned....
         that the Lord didn't  do it all in one
         day. What makes  me think I can?

  I've  learned....
         that if you are still  talking about
         what you did  yesterday, you haven't
         done much  today.

  I've  learned....
         that to ignore the  facts does not
         change the  facts.

  I've  learned....
         that when you plan to  get even with
        someone, you are  only letting that
         person continue  to hurt you.


  I've  learned....
        that it is best to  give advice in only
         two  circumstances; when it is  requested
         and when it is a  life-threatening
         situation.

  I've  learned....
         that a good friend is  the one who tells
        you how you  really look in your jeans.

  I've  learned....
        that the less time I  have to work with,
         the more things  I get done.

  I've learned. . .
      That poetry is not just words but feelings

 I've learned. . .
      helping people in need is the best thing we
      ever could do.

 I've learned , , .
      life is not what you acheived, or winning
      but the many times you have lended an ear,
      a hand, and a heart.

 I've learned,
      that no matter what education you attain,
     how many diplomas you gained.
      doesnt mean you can understand everyhting.

 I'ver learned,
      that the more pain and hurt you experience
      the more knowledgeable and understanding you are.

 I've, learned. . .  I am learning

PRAYER WHEEL

When you receive this, say a prayer for the person that sent it to
you.... That's all you have to do....There is nothing attached....This
is powerful.... Just send this to four people and watch God answer
prayer to work in your life.

Do not break this, please.... Prayer is one of the best free gifts we
receive.... There is no cost but a lot of rewards.... Let's continue
praying for one another. Thanks for praying.
