I had a good "clear the air" talk with Art yesterday.  We came up with a 
couple things that will improve the process. 

1.  Citizens needs to subscribe to EOL so that Art can execute trades without 
calling me or anyone else at Enron.  This will improve execution.  Sean, 
please make this a priority.  Call the 800 number and make it happen.  Call 
me if you need help.

2.      Kim Ward will be the point person for gettting NYMEX and Basis 
quotes.  Kim's number is 713/853-0685.  I will be helping Kim, but she is in 
a better position to execute trades as she is on the desk.

3.  Citizens should consider getting swap contracts in place with 
counterparties other than Enron (and Enron as well) so that you can do fixed 
price deals with others in the event that you can obtain more attractive 
pricing than what Enron is offering at any point in time.

Please let me know if you want further follow-up re: your e-mail below.  
Also, please push forward on the 2 contracts (gas contract amendedment and 
power contract master).

Thanks

Would you kindly call me next week (Tues/Weds is  best) to discuss.? Thanks

Subject: NYMEX fixed prices obtained from Enron

Sean,
?
As we discussed on  the telephone today, I have a concern surrounding the 
pricing Enron gave  us?while establishing NYMEX fixed pricing for the months 
of April 2001, May  2001, June 2001, July 2001 and August 2001.
?
Today, we first  contacted Enron to obtain market quotes at 10:58 am cst.? In 
every month we  requested a quote on NYMEX, Enron gave a quote that was no 
less than two cents  higher than the offer on the floor of the NYMEX.? Gelber 
questioned the  quotes as being outside the market.? Gelber chose to end the 
telephone call  after questioning the quotes.? At 11:08 am, Gelber called 
Enron  again.? The election was made to proceed with execution of the 
necessary  positions.? For the months of April, May, June, and August we 
received  prices that were at the offer side of the NYMEX bid/offer spread.? 
However,  on the month of July the price received was not only outside of the 
then current  NYMEX bid/offer range but was indeed higher than the NYMEX high 
for the day on  the July contract.? Specifically, the Citizen's Arizona Gas 
price received  for July 2001 from Enron is $5.340, the high for the day on 
NYMEX was  $5.290.
?
I do not currently  feel comfortable with Enron's pricing methods.? My 
assessment after today's  transactions is only partially favorable.? It is my 
understanding that  Citizen's compensates Enron in other parts of your 
business relationship and  their should be no need for them to mark prices up 
when executing either NYMEX,  basis, or a combination of the two.
?
Citizen's may want  to consider pursuing alternative mechanism's?for securing 
fixed pricing via  other accessible markets.
?
Sincerely,
?

Kim, 
Citizens needs confirmation from ENA on deliveries to the TW/Griffith interconnect for the following: 
July 17 -  PPL claims that they bought gas after 8:30 AM from Enron.  Citizens has billed them for the deliveries, but PPL has the deal as a purchase from Enron in there system and desire to have Enron bill them.  Is this acceptable to Enron? 
July 26 - PPL claims that they bought gas after 8:30 AM from a third party, Texaco, in the basin and had it transported under the Citizens/PPL deal.  Does Enron agree with this transaction? 
Thanks,

Chris,

this looks good to me.  Stephanie is checking with Transwestern to see what their parking/lending fees would be for weekends, just for an idea.  I am also talking to the desk.  I will keep you posted.

Kim:

Please review and add anything you want and return.

John/Sean:

A few thoughts on the Griffith deal:

1.  Term:  PPL indicates they want to do the deal through 2003.  That is really 2003 - 2004 as it incldues Nov - Mar.  Extension until this time might require extension of our underlying deal.  This would be OK with us.
2.  Character of service:   The text indicates that PPL would have the right to request deliveries be made to an alternqate point on TW.  Why would they want this?  This could be a problem if we know the gas wouldn't flow as we would shut in puchases.  We would like to make this on a mutually acceptable basis.
3.  Pricing:  Does the reservation cahrge include variable transport?  I think that is what we proposed.  If not, then the Commodity rate flow needs to include the variable cost of  transport plus fuel.
4.  Conditions:  Noms must be in at 8:00 am.  This is very important and the a deal killer.  We need time to manage the position.  Also, the weekend issue needs to be addressed.  As we have discussed, weekends trade as the same quantity each day.  If they want to vary the daily amoount during the weekend and make Sunday higher than Sat or Monday, that is fairly ewaasy to deal with.  If they want to have lower takes on Sunday, this is more difficult ad increases costs.  We might be able to craft a solution to this however.

Chris

Good morning, 

Hope you had a great Easter weekend. 

Attached are two (2) word files for your review.  First, there is the latest  
draft of the Sales Proposal which reflects the best efforts and intra day  
provisions.  Second, there is the Alternate Nominations provisions.  I spoke  
with PPL this morning and said that I would try to get both of these  
documents to them today.  Your timely review and comments are greatly  
appreciated. 

The Alternate Nominations language is being separately provided at the  
request of PPL so that they can review it.  If they would like to have it  
incorporated, it can easily incorporated into the proposal and/or agreement. 

Chris, I used the working draft of the Enron/Citizens agreement from our  
meeting last Monday in Houston to draft the Alternate Nominations language.   
That draft did not provide for a price differentiation for nominations  
between 8:30 and 9:00 am CPT.  Should there be one? 

Best regard, 

John

Space on EP to Nogales out of Permian Keystone or Waha is not available.  It 
might become available in early Feb. We can watch it and look for a good day 
to do this.  If it absolutely needs to happen in Jan we might be able to do a 
flow day diversion from the SoCal border but that will add a significant 
amount to the price as it would cost SoCAl Border plus.  Can we wait?

Following our discussion of last Thur., we need to prepare the term sheet for 
Citizens. I want to focus on the TW deal first.  There are a number of things 
that I hope you can get from the desk by early afternoon my time, so we have 
time to do the term sheet.

I want to show them a structure that would give them right to call on gas 
each day.  What there be a demand charge?  What would be the Gas Daily 
adder?  High end of the range?  Mid point?  What would the demand charge be 
for mid-point of the range?  We would also compensate the desk to receive a 
demand charge equal to the full monthly cost of the lateral.  The desk should 
love that much of the structure.  Try to get some numbers from Janie.

 I have had numerous conversations with Citizens and TW.  TW will do the deal 
but want their liability limited to $140,000 year.  Citizens wants this 
liability increased to $1,000,000.  We could do this by buying insurance.  We 
might subcontract with TW to do this so the services deals is between ENA and 
Citizens. We would need to increase the demand charge to pay for this 
increase in laibility.

Once we know all our costs, we would bundle this together and then increase 
the demand charge for orig. 

Call me first thing on Monday

Kim,

Thanks for all your help today.  I apologize for my propensity to catch you
away from your desk.  We all have to be good at something, right?  Anyway,
here are the fixed-price volumes associated with a portion of the basis
transactions done in June and Q3.  I'm missing some deal numbers, but I'm
guessing you won't need those.

Deal Number  Month  Date  Volume Price

   June  12/28/2000 50,000 5.320
EU8529.X/67851 June  2/16/2001 50,000 5.530

   July  12/28/2000 50,000 5.340
EU8529.P/67851 July  1/19/2001 50,000 5.630

   August 12/28/2000 50,000 5.290

EU8529.G-L/67851 September 1/10/2001 60,000 6.020
QS5478.1/67851 September 2/16/2001 50,000 5.530


In other news, a few of us, including Art and I, are getting together for
drinks after work tomorrow if you or anyone else is interested.
Coincidentally, the State Bar is the location of choice, so I hope you
aren't State Bar-ed out.  Let us know.  I believe everyone will be swinging
by around 5 or so.

Thanks again,

some of their ideas but in a manner to make it more acceptable to us.  This 
is attached.  Please review and edit this document and return to me so I can 
forward to Citizens.

My number is 503/464-3822.

Darla,

I have completed reviewing your invoice revisions for October and November
1999 and January, February, June and July 2000.  I have found a couple of
discrepancies in the worksheets that you sent on December 22, 1999.  Those
discrepancies are as follows:

1) October 1999 - Transwestern - Commodity sale/purchase cost and pipeline
transportation cost do not equal the total Transwestern cost.  This is do to
not using the rounding option in the detail computations.  While this
difference is only $0.01, the spreadsheet should total correctly.

2) January 2000 - EPNG - Total transportation cost was not equal to sum of
details.  Use of rounding option corrects the discrepancy.

3) July 2000 - Transwestern - Transportation commodity charges were based
upon a volume of 153,272.  The net usage after deducting 3rd party deliveries
of 5,187 from measured city gate throughput of 160,650 is 155,463.  Net usage
should have used in calculating transportation commodity charges.

Attached are revised Enron worksheets for the above stated months that have
been modified to reflect these changes.

In an attempt to close the book on invoicing and payment issues, I have
extended Enron's "Citizens Revisions" worksheet to cover the period November
1998 through July 2000, file attached.  The data presented for the months
January through July 2000, were taken from Citizens' records.  I request that
you verify the accuracy of that data with Enron's records and advise me of
any discrepancies. It should be noted that all corrections that you made plus
the one stated above are reflected in the worksheet.

I will be in Houston next week and would like to meet with you to bring
closure to these invoicing issues.  I am scheduled to meet with Frank Vickers
and other Enron folks at 10 AM on Wednesday, January 10, 2001.  I have a
flight to return to New Orleans at 4:30 PM.  My morning meeting with Enron
should conclude by noon.  Please check your schedule and see if there is time
either before 10 AM or after noon, that you can meet with me.  I am willing
to meet before and after my morning meeting, if necessary.

Please advise on your availability to meet and should you have any questions,
please let me know.  Thanks for your assistance.

Sharen:

As we discussed, here is the Del. Pt. language for sales at NP and SP15.  For 
any sale beyond April 2002 (not purchases), we might want to use this 
language, but only if the trader requests it in a note on the deal entry.  If 
the trader does not request it, it is our understanding that you will try to 
catch it and notify us to make sure the new language is not desired by the 
trader (Use me as a contact and I will ask the trader).  It is understood, 
however, that if the trader does not request the language and you do not 
catch it the trader bears the risk.

Thanks

Chris

Gentlemen:
In an earlier communication, I had asked Gelber to forward a summary
spreadsheet of Citizens' forward purchases position monthly before the 10th
of the following month.  To avert potential problems, I would request,
instead, that the summary spreadsheet be sent out on or before the last
trading day of the current month. Kindly copy Chris Foster at Enron on these
transmissions.  Please call if you have any questions.  Thanks.

This is an example of the type of things I continue to manage for Citizens.  
At this point my role is customer service, making sure their questions and 
concerns are being addressed.  I work extensively with Patti Sullivan and 
Darla Saucier to keep things on even keel.  I would like to stay involved as 
I think that is in the interest of the client and EPMI. but continue to ramp 
down.  This has been occurring  as you have already taken over the 
transaction side of the deal.  If you want to take over everything that is 
fine too, and no offense will be taken, but doing so will take a significant 
investment of time on your part to get up to spped on the deal structure and 
the nuances of transport on El Paso.

As I discussed they want to get together next week to discuss the "new deal" 
and the TW operator transaction.  These deals are somewhat hairy and will be 
hard to close, but there is a significant amount of money that we could 
make.  I would like to help close that deal.  With respect to the orig 
question, my thought is I am very comfortable having you determine how much 
orig (if any) you think I deserve after the fact based on the value you think 
I added to the transaction if it gets done.  If you want to handle it 
yourself and use me as a consultant that is OK too.

Let me know what you think on Monday

John/Sean:

I am a little confused on how the pricing indicated in your term sheet would 
work.  I think if we review the attached it will clarify things.  Please call 
me later to discuss.  I want to make sure we understand how the pricing would 
work for Griffith as well as Enron to Citizens.  

Also, I think the Commodity section of your proposal term sheet has some 
missing words.  You don't seem to be adding the spread value of interstate 
transport to the Commodity charge.  

I will be out for an hour.  Back at 1:00 Portland time.

Chris

This note is in reference to our phone conversation  earlier today.? As a 
result of that conversation the following actions will  be taken:

Gelber will add to its deal tracking spreadsheet  a?column for Enron's 
transaction number and make sure the field is  maintained for all Enron 
transactions;
A copy of the deal tracking spreadsheet for  January 2001 will be sent to 
Enron;
Linking of Basis transactions with NYMEX  transactions will be done as 
follows for any particular transaction  month:

??? If fixed Basis volumes are less  than fixed NYMEX??volumes, Gelber will 
link Basis volumes to  an?equivalent?volume of fixed NYMEX gas;
??? If fixed Basis volumes  are?greater than fixed NYMEX volumes, all NYMEX 
transactions will be  linked to one or more?Basis transactions and the 
balance of Basis volumes  will be assumed to be linked to Index gas?
??? If there are no fixed NYMEX  transactions, any Basis transactions will be 
assumed linked to Index  gas.

Please contact me if any of this is unclear or you  have?issues.? Thanks.?

How are you planning on keeping track of all the trades you do for Citizens 
and communicating that info to them?  We need to make sure that all the 
billing people have this info so the bills are correct.  My suggestion is 
that you maintain a spreadsheet that has all trades and send it to me and the

agree.

Chris,

Thank you for the conversation the other day.  Gelber's intent is to sit on
the side of AZ Gas and that does not necessarily mean in opposition to
Enron.  I personally hope to work constructively for their benefit, and to
the benefit of Enron, Gelber and others who may be involved.  Sometimes
however, our interests may be contrary and I apologize up front when that is
the case.

I have urged Sean to move ahead on EOL and he is doing so.  Moreover please
provide your fax number and I'll fax you audited financials.

Thanks.

Art Gelber

      Chris H Foster)

I had a good "clear the air" talk with Art yesterday.  We came up with a
couple things that will improve the process.

1.  Citizens needs to subscribe to EOL so that Art can execute trades
without calling me or anyone else at Enron.  This will improve execution.
Sean, please make this a priority.  Call the 800 number and make it happen.
Call me if you need help.

2.      Kim Ward will be the point person for gettting NYMEX and Basis
quotes.  Kim's number is 713/853-0685.  I will be helping Kim, but she is
in a better position to execute trades as she is on the desk.

3.  Citizens should consider getting swap contracts in place with
counterparties other than Enron (and Enron as well) so that you can do
fixed price deals with others in the event that you can obtain more
attractive pricing than what Enron is offering at any point in time.

Please let me know if you want further follow-up re: your e-mail below.
Also, please push forward on the 2 contracts (gas contract amendedment and
power contract master).

Thanks

Chris

Subject: NYMEX fixed prices obtained from Enron

Sean,

As we discussed on  the telephone today, I have a concern surrounding the
pricing Enron gave  us?while establishing NYMEX fixed pricing for the
months of April 2001, May  2001, June 2001, July 2001 and August 2001.

Today, we first  contacted Enron to obtain market quotes at 10:58 am cst.
In every month we  requested a quote on NYMEX, Enron gave a quote that was
no less than two cents  higher than the offer on the floor of the NYMEX.
Gelber questioned the  quotes as being outside the market.? Gelber chose to
end the telephone call  after questioning the quotes.? At 11:08 am, Gelber
called Enron  again.? The election was made to proceed with execution of
the necessary  positions.? For the months of April, May, June, and August
we received  prices that were at the offer side of the NYMEX bid/offer
spread.? However,  on the month of July the price received was not only
outside of the then current  NYMEX bid/offer range but was indeed higher
than the NYMEX high for the day on  the July contract.? Specifically, the
Citizen's Arizona Gas price received  for July 2001 from Enron is $5.340,
the high for the day on NYMEX was  $5.290.

I do not currently  feel comfortable with Enron's pricing methods.? My
assessment after today's  transactions is only partially favorable.? It is
my understanding that  Citizen's compensates Enron in other parts of your
business relationship and  their should be no need for them to mark prices
up when executing either NYMEX,  basis, or a combination of the two.

Citizen's may want  to consider pursuing alternative mechanism's?for
securing fixed pricing via  other accessible markets.

Sincerely,

Art Gelber

I would argue that the physical premium should actually be ($.012/MMBtu) as you are displacing gas that would have to be sold as indexed.  That said, we have never done it that way.  My thought is that you would simply do it at the swap offer and have no physical premium arguing that that approach still leaves the desk better off compared to a sale at minus .012.  You could book it as a physical sale with no phyisical premium.

Chris, attorneys have indicated there is no affiliate problem with EAMR 
negotiating a contract with ENA for the operation of the Citizens assets as 
described in the contract I sent you Friday.   IF we can make it work it 
makes more sense this way and tells a good story in support of the "One

Please let me know what your availability is for Wednesday so I can set up a 
conference call with legal and marketing services to discuss the work to be 
done so we can flush out the liability issue.  You and I can continue our

the back fill price from California, can get done for $10.00 or less, Sean
has agreed that we can use the back fill option.

Kim:

Can you do this for Citizens?  Tom will be out of the office today, but back 
tomorrow, but please send the spreadsheet over to Tom today so we can be sure 
we understand each other on the arithmetic. 

Today's numbers will be indicative only.  He will call you tomorrow or later 
in the week at 713/853-0685 to see what the latest prices are and be in a 
position to give you a firm bid.  Tom's number is 520/226-2246.  Call me if 
you have any questions as to the format of the spreadsheet.

Thanks!

Chris

John:

Kim and I have been working on the spreadsheet to calculate the pricing under our new deal.  We have made some significant changes from the latest draft you prepared.  Here is.  The way we are thinking about this is a s follows:

1.  We will be selling the volume to Citizens at Thoreau.  The volume will be the Griffith City Gate volume, grossed up for fuel
2.  The price will be San Juan Gas Daily, divided by (1 - fuel), plus 100% of the lateral fixed and variable pipeline charges, plus $.075 times the "Spread Value"
3.  "Spread Value" = a - b where

	a = PG&E Topock minus the discount and

	b = San Juan index divided by fuel, plus lateral charges, that divided by mainline fuel, plus all mainline charges

Let me know if you agree.  We need to resolve this by close of business Friday so we can properly do month end close.  I will be out all day today, but working Friday.  The attached spreadsheet shows the arithmetic but the volumes and actual indexes are not correct.  Please check the arithmetic and call me Friday.

Also, what should we assume for July 1st?

Thanks

C

For April the indexes were as follows:

San Juan NGI - $4.51/MMBtu
SoCal:  $12.56
PG&E SoCal:  $7.71

So, PG&E is a  lot less valuable but still decent at $3.31 spread.  

Re: your question, the more I think about it the more I think PG&E is the 
relevant index.  A basket would be better for Citizens but less attractive to 
Griffith.  Can you sell them on the basket?

Thanks, Chris. 

What are your thoughts on using a basket approach to the index? ?As an  
alternative to just using either SoCal or PGE, we could use the average. ? 
Would any other index points be appropriate? 

See the attached file. ?I have provided for averaging the two indexes.

Subject:	PPL Proposal


Gentlemen,

I tried to reach both of you late in the evening, but was unsuccessful.  I
will be traveling starting at 7 am Las Vegas time back to NO.  I have a brief
layover in Phoenix and will try to contact you.

Initial reaction to our proposal during the day was that it looked pretty
good.  This I got from Terry Crupi.  At that time Terry had not seen the
proposal, but was relaying what he had gotten from Barbara Veety back in
Allentown. In the early evening I met with John Baileys, Terry Crupi, and Joe
Cammarano of PPL.  At that meeting they expressed concern for the reservation
charge and floor, especially since the Citizens' TW contract has no
alternative market.  I asked if a cap would help ease their concerns and they
said that they did not think so.  They are really struggling with the
reservation charge as we have currently proposed it.  They agree that we
should at a minimum recover all of our fixed pipeline fees in a reservation
charge.  We did not have a chance to get into discussions about other
potential cost that would be appropriately placed in the reservation charge.

They would prefer a pure index based deal and could agree to a load factor of
about 80%, but indicated that they could live with some monthly reservation
fee based upon the monthly index, but we did not get into much detail on
exactly how that would work.

Perhaps the biggest issue that came out of this meeting is that they do not
believe that the SoCal Border is the appropriate index.  They believe that
the PG&E City Gate is more reflective of what the market price is.  They
claim that the SoCal point reflects the El Paso cuts.

In a passing comment John Baileys indicated that they have gotten a number of
 proposals that are attractive on both El Paso and TW.

John Baileys wants to do something with Citizens and is interested in a term
that would go for a least 2 years.  I ask if going through September 03 had
appeal and he responded affirmatively.  He also said that a provision that
allowed for available capacity to move up or down would be acceptable.

PPL wants to keep this process on a fast track, as do we.

The next steps:

1) PPL will provide a counter proposal on Monday.

2) Chris, what insight can you provide on the index issue.  I do not have
much history on that point, but on Friday of last week PGE City Gate was
$9.08 while SoCal Border was $10.90.  What are the historical prices for PGE?
 What are the drivers for the price differences between PGE and SoCal?  Is
the PGE index mature?  I have not followed it.  Is it a more appropriate
index for TW?

Hopefully we can catch up in the morning from Phoenix.

John

Can you handle this?  Put a deal in the system to deliver a total of 3000 
MMBtu plus fuel into the Citizens IT agreement and schedule it to the Nogales 
delivery point.  Do it some time before the end of the month Citizens will 
pay the transport bill. They will pay us for the gas.

Lou,
Based on Jim's comments below, the attached revised version of the compromise proposal contains a change on the last page. 
 4444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444
Please let us know if any other changes need to be made to the document before sending it to Citizens.
We hope to send the proposal to Citizens tomorrow morning after you have returned to the office and had an opportunity to review this e-mail.
Also, to let you kinow, Citizens Communications as of the end of 2000 held $7 Billion in assets and had adjusted EBITDA of $509 Million on revenues of $1.8 Billion.
Question:  What percentage chance is there that a court might set the indemnity aside as Jim mentioned below in the previous e-mail?

Chris,
Jim mentioned that ENA might want to consider being an additional insured under the insurance policy.  Any thoughts or comments?

Best regards,
Sarabeth

Our liability should be limited to recoveries from the insurances required in the contract and specifically purchased for work under this contract. If covered by the policy, we will respond.  Losses, costs and expenses not recovered from the insurance, shall remain the obligation of Citizens. 

Once again, if they agree to the limitation, the continued concerns would be:
1. The indemnity would be set aside by a court.
2. The indemnity from Citizens does not hold or they are financially unable to respond.

Please advise if there are further questions.

1.  Complete Pooler Request Forms
2.  Provide historical load data

I will be out the rest of the week.  Kim will be back tomorrow (Wed.).  

Are you going to be handling these El Paso-related informational requirements for Citizens?  Please call Kim and let her know if there is anything we needs to do to help.

Patti Sullivan has cerated a new El Paso interruptible contract for 
delivering to Griffith.  It is an Enron contract.  This agreemnet is 9M52.  
For the gas we delivered yesterday, we will be invoicing Citizens based on 
deliveries as a special deal over and above our base deal.  You will have an 
imbalance at Griffith that will go to your OBA.  I will get you the price 
later today.

Nogales used some gas last month.  Citizens has an IT contract 989N that we 
can use to deliver to this point.  I am still a little uncertain as to how 
you want us to handle this.  Please advise if the following procedure is how 
you want it handled:

1.  EPMI will deliver gas to Nogales on 989N
2.  When gas is delivered, we will bill Citizens based on the price when gas 
is delivered rather then when used, as you want this account isolated.
3.  We should "0-out" any current imbalance position at Noglaes based on 1 
and 2 above.

Please call to discuss.

Chris

Chris, 

I hope that your voice is improving and that you are feeling better. 

I have attached a revised Citizens/Enron Griffith supply proposal and a  
redlined version to show the changes from your draft.  I have eliminated the  
$0.07 commodity add-on for Excess Utilities Volumes as we discussed  
yesterday.  I have also eliminated the late nominations provision since it is  
not in the Griffith proposal.  And, last, I have noted some pricing  
considerations for the Firm Peaking Requirements. 

Sean and I have not discussed this proposal so everything is subject to his  
agreement.  I hope to talk with Sean this morning. 

All the best, 

John

As a follow up to yesterday's meeting, below is a summary of the course of action to be taken in response to Citizens comments on the service agreement with EAMR.

Enron will work with Citizens to put an insurance policy in place, which meets the insurance provisions requested by Citizens and which names both Citizens and EAMR as policy holders.  See attached file for proposed policy details.
The cost for this policy (not to be revealed to Citizens) will be between $5,000 and $7,500 and will be paid for by ENA.
ENA will enter into a side letter agreement with EAMR, which will provide for the insurance premium payment.
Upon agreement with Citizens on the insurance policy details, EAMR is agreeable to executing a services agreement with Citizens, however, Citizens must agree to EAMR's indemnity and liability contract language as written in its original draft (see attached below). 


Attached is a file containing Citizens' comments on its draft services agreement with EAMR.  Article 8 of the draft agreement details the insurance provisions requested by Citizens.
 
For reference, the original draft sent to Citizens dated effective January 15, 2001 is attached below:

Chris,

This is to confirm our conversation this morning:

1)  Citizens has entered into a letter agreement that allows for it to sell
gas to PPL during the plant operations testing phase.

2)  Sales will be determined daily with the price being set at some discount
to the border, but in no event to be less than Gas Daily Mid Point San Juan
plus $0.50/MMBtu.  The discount level will have to reflect the we cannot
accept a put of any case back to us.

3)  Enron participation in the deal would be as follows:

    a) Enron would recover the cost of:
        1. Gas cost in the basin priced at Gas Daily Mid Point San Juan
        2.  TW fuel cost, currently approximately 4.75%
        3. Daily demand cost of moving gas down the TW San Juan Lateral
currently           approximately $0.10/MMBtu.
        4. Variable transportation cost on both the TW San Juan Lateral and
        Mainline.
    b) Enron would participate in the gross margins of any sale at 8.5%.
Gross margins would be determined by subtracting        the Enron's cost from
the sales price.

Chris, I hope that this properly reflects our conversation this morning.  If
it does not, please let me know.

As a follow-up item, we really need to complete the gas supply agreement for
the commercial operations and to also cover this arrangement during the
testing phase.  Citizens would appreciate a push on getting this done.  I
know that there may still be the issue with the operations agreement, but we
should be able to get a draft out that would reflect the deal assuming
concurrence on the operating agreement.

Best regards,

John Cogan
For Citizens

Subject: PPL Proposal


Gentlemen,

I tried to reach both of you late in the evening, but was unsuccessful.  I
will be traveling starting at 7 am Las Vegas time back to NO.  I have a brief
layover in Phoenix and will try to contact you.

Initial reaction to our proposal during the day was that it looked pretty
good.  This I got from Terry Crupi.  At that time Terry had not seen the
proposal, but was relaying what he had gotten from Barbara Veety back in
Allentown. In the early evening I met with John Baileys, Terry Crupi, and Joe
Cammarano of PPL.  At that meeting they expressed concern for the reservation
charge and floor, especially since the Citizens' TW contract has no
alternative market.  I asked if a cap would help ease their concerns and they
said that they did not think so.  They are really struggling with the
reservation charge as we have currently proposed it.  They agree that we
should at a minimum recover all of our fixed pipeline fees in a reservation
charge.  We did not have a chance to get into discussions about other
potential cost that would be appropriately placed in the reservation charge.

They would prefer a pure index based deal and could agree to a load factor of
about 80%, but indicated that they could live with some monthly reservation
fee based upon the monthly index, but we did not get into much detail on
exactly how that would work.

Perhaps the biggest issue that came out of this meeting is that they do not
believe that the SoCal Border is the appropriate index.  They believe that
the PG&E City Gate is more reflective of what the market price is.  They
claim that the SoCal point reflects the El Paso cuts.

In a passing comment John Baileys indicated that they have gotten a number of
 proposals that are attractive on both El Paso and TW.

John Baileys wants to do something with Citizens and is interested in a term
that would go for a least 2 years.  I ask if going through September 03 had
appeal and he responded affirmatively.  He also said that a provision that
allowed for available capacity to move up or down would be acceptable.

PPL wants to keep this process on a fast track, as do we.

The next steps:

1) PPL will provide a counter proposal on Monday.

2) Chris, what insight can you provide on the index issue.  I do not have
much history on that point, but on Friday of last week PGE City Gate was
$9.08 while SoCal Border was $10.90.  What are the historical prices for PGE?
 What are the drivers for the price differences between PGE and SoCal?  Is
the PGE index mature?  I have not followed it.  Is it a more appropriate
index for TW?

Hopefully we can catch up in the morning from Phoenix.

John

Jim:

As we have discussed, ENA is trying to close a gas supply transaction with Citizens Gas in Arizona to provide gas supply to Citizens for ultimate delivery to PP&L for the Griffith power plant.  As part of this transaction, Enron Asset Management Resources (EAMR) would provide services to operate a pipeline that interconnects El Paso and Transwestern to the pipeline header system that ultimately interconnects with the Griffith power plant. To date, it has been the reasonable position of EAMR that its liability for services provided to Citizens should be "capped" at the sum of its annual fee of $144,000.  Citizens wants a $1,000,000 limit.  Citizens and EAMR have agreed to all aspects of the services deal except this liability question.  Although it might be possible to close our gas deal without EAMR, this is far from certain.  I have been trying to come up with an approach that would bridge this gap so that the ENA gas deal can be closed. 

This e-mail is intended to indicate the value of this transaction to Enron and get your viewpoint as to the feasibility and cost of one of two deal structures:

1)  ENA buys insurance to cover the cost of our buying a policy to bridge th gap in liability from $144,000 to $1,000,000.
2)  EAMR decides to increase the laibiltiy to $1,000,000 in return for increasing their earnings on the deal by the amount ENA would pay fior the insurance product - about $120,000.

ENA's preference is clearly for approach 2.

The attached spreadsheet indicates the value of this transaction to Enron.  ENA will earn approximately $3 million on the deal.  Please keep this number in confidence.  In addition, we have budgeted about $120,000 for the insurance product to increase the liability of EAMR from $140,000 to $1,000,000.

Can you please advise me as to the feasibility of 1) or 2) above?  If there is no way we are going to get there, I need to know fairly quickly so I can explore other options.  If it is possible, which of the above 2 approaches is better from you perspective?

Citizens will be here today at 3:00 pm.  I would greatly appreciate some feedback from you by that time.

To contact me please call Kim Ward at 713/853-0685 and she will be able to find me.

Thanks very much for you time.

Chris

Upon agreement with Citizens on the insurance policy details, EAMR is agreeable to executing a services agreement with Citizens, however, Citizens must agree to EAMR's indemnity and liability contract language as written in its original draft (see attached below). 


Attached is a file containing Citizens' comments on its draft services agreement with EAMR.  Article 8 of the draft agreement details the insurance provisions requested by Citizens.
 
For reference, the original draft sent to Citizens dated effective January 15, 2001 is attached below:

Sara Beth called and said that she thinks EAMR and Citizens have resolved the insurance issue.  I am hopeful that is the case.  

Attached are drafts of the ENA/Citizens Confirmation Agreement and the ENA/Citizens/Cogan Agreement.  Please review them both for final changes.  Once you have given final approval we will forward original Confirmation Letters for your signature.  With respect to the Cogan Letter, we would like Citizens to send the letter to us.  Let me know if this is OK.

Thanks

Chris

Darla-
Here is the spreadsheet for Citizens/PPL Griffith for October.  I don't think that the pipe rates have changed for the month, but if they have, can you just change my numbers at the top of the sheet.  I would really appreciate it.  If you have any questions, call me.
Thanks,
Mara

John/Sean:

A few thoughts on the Griffith deal:

1.  Term:  PPL indicates they want to do the deal through 2003.  That is really 2003 - 2004 as it incldues Nov - Mar.  Extension until this time might require extension of our underlying deal.  This would be OK with us.
2.  Character of service:   The text indicates that PPL would have the right to request deliveries be made to an alternqate point on TW.  Why would they want this?  This could be a problem if we know the gas wouldn't flow as we would shut in puchases.  We would like to make this on a mutually acceptable basis.
3.  Pricing:  Does the reservation cahrge include variable transport?  I think that is what we proposed.  If not, then the Commodity rate flow needs to include the variable cost of  transport plus fuel.
4.  Conditions:  Noms must be in at 8:00 am.  This is very important and the a deal killer.  We need time to manage the position.  Also, the weekend issue needs to be addressed.  As we have discussed, weekends trade as the same quantity each day.  If they want to vary the daily amoount during the weekend and make Sunday higher than Sat or Monday, that is fairly ewaasy to deal with.  If they want to have lower takes on Sunday, this is more difficult ad increases costs.  We might be able to craft a solution to this however.

Sean/John,
We'd like to thank you for puttting together this offer for bundled supply to
our Griffith facility.  We are very agreeable to the structure and general
framework that you have laid out.  We did make a few modifications however and
you can find them in the attached redlined version of your proposal.  We will
available to discuss this proposal with Citizens.

Thanks

Check Case 2, it seems like the gas cost to Enron could excced the floor 
price as we would be charging pipeline costs.  Isn't the floor San Juan plus 
$07 plus fixed plus variable pipeline cost plus fuel?

It looks like we are done on the new Citizens deal effective July 1.  I have sent original contracts for execution.  We now have to put the deal in the system.  This is a little complicated.  

The attached spreadsheet indicates how this deal will work, using June as an example.  The only differences between June and future months are:

1)  In the future, we will collect a $.09/MMBtu demand charge with $.02/MMBtu of this going to EAMR (ENA gets $.07/MMBtu)
2)  In the future, the PG&E discount is $.10, not $.25.

Some of the complicated booking issues are:

1.  We need to show the John Cogan commission as a separate deal and a cost to ENA
2.  We need to show the payment to EAMR as a separate deal and a cost to ENA
3.  We will continue to bill Citizens for the TW Mainline cost on our utility deal

1 and 2 above are pretty straight forward and should not create any deal entry difficulties other than someone will have to enter the deals.  Number 3 is more difficult.  The complexities relate to where we are making the sale and what costs should be included.  

Can you get with the folks who can help us here and have them come up with a recommendation on how this deal should be booked?  Let me know if you have questions.  I also believe I can add value in speaking with Darren Giron or others.  I guaranty their initial recommendation will not be 100% workable.

Thanks!

Chris

Barry:

This is the insurance language that would appear in the contract between Enron Asset Management Resources (EAMR) and Citizens.  I will send you a second e-mail that summarizes the proposed deal between EAMR and ENA.  As we discussed I would like you to look at this insurance arrangement and see if ENA has any risk.  My view of it is that this creates no risk to ENA, but I have not structured a deal in this way before and would appreciate a second opinion. 

Thanks

Sean:  The attached spreadsheet indicates that for Feb., Citizens has 5 fixed 
price deals, 3 of which you have locked in NYMEX and basis, and 2 of which 
you locked in NYMEX but basis will go to the default which I think is IFGMR - 
NX1.

Kim:  Can you check to see if this matches the way the deals are entered into 
our system and that the prices match the spreadsheet?

Chris, attorneys have indicated there is no affiliate problem with EAMR 
negotiating a contract with ENA for the operation of the Citizens assets as 
described in the contract I sent you Friday.   IF we can make it work it 
makes more sense this way and tells a good story in support of the "One

Please let me know what your availability is for Wednesday so I can set up a 
conference call with legal and marketing services to discuss the work to be 
done so we can flush out the liability issue.  You and I can continue our 
discussion on price one on one.

Thanks,

Don

Thanks for the update.  Let's hope Citizens sticks with you guys for the full term.  Jeff Hodge told me yesterday that he has requested some changes in the ENA/EAMR contract from Lou, but that Lou hasn't called back.  I will assume that you will follow up on that contract and make sure it gets done.  With respect to the monthly fee, I am assuming you will be sending ENA an invoice each month.  Kim Ward at 713/853-0685 will be your contact person if the invoice isn't paid and she will coordinate with our settlements group until we get into a monthly routine.

Let me know if there are any other issues.

Chris

Lou, Chris and Jeff,
The services agreement between EAMR and Citizens for gas control and transaction management services is now executed.  
Yesterday afternoon, Citizens faxed the execution pages back to us.  EAMR's original of the agreement is expected in the mail shortly.
Full service under the agreement is beginning today.
Last week EAMR put the total insurance package in place that finally satisfied Citizens' requirements.

The West Gas Desk built up a negative imbalance on Citizen's TA (Transportation Agreement) 97ZH.  Citizens purchased 23,175 MMBtu to apply to this imbalance.  For the May invoice, we need to subtract this amount from usage.  Enter the volume into the area where we show transportation by others to the citygate.  This is logical as we otherwise would have to transport this gas in ourselves.

After this trade, the TA imbalance on 97ZH will be 30,688 MMBtu.  ENA is responsible for this imbalance.  It is my understanding that future imbalances will go to the 97ZH OBA rather than the TA.  Therefore, this current TA imbalance will be there until it is eliminated.

Call me with any questions.

Chris
