aegrotat (EE-gro-tat, ee-GRO-tat) noun

   An unclassified degree granted a university student who has fulfilled
   all requirements for graduation but was prevented by illness from
   attending the final examinations.

[From Latin aegrotat literally, he is sick, equivalent to aegrot(us) sick
(aeg(e)r sick + -otus adjectival suffix) + -at 3rd singular ending.]

   "Powell got a first in the exams he sat in the nursing home - his
   classics tripos finals. If he had not been able to sit them there, he
   would only have got an aegrotat degree - which might well have affected
   his future."
   Eric James, Deep rivers, indeed, New Statesman, Apr 24, 1998.

louche (loosh) adjective

   Of questionable character; dubious; disreputable.

[From French louche, cross-eyed, from Old French lousche, feminine of lois,
from Latin lusca, feminine of luscus, one-eyed.]

   "They wanted her to be a dancer, but the teenage Bardot fell in with the
   louche and devious film-maker Roger Vadim, and became the notorious Girl
   In A Bikini instead."
   Adam Sweeting, Channel Surfing: Zouzou Exposed, The Guardian (UK),
   Nov 7, 1998.

A popular admonition goes, "Don't judge a book by its cover." Yet we do it
all the time. We ascribe qualities of character to people based on their
physical characteristics. And our language takes shape to reflect that
attitude. Are cross-eyed people shady? I don't think so. At least not any
more than the straight-eyed ones. In this week's AWAD we look at more such
words.                                                               -Anu

Pyrrhic victory (PIR-ik VIK-tuh-ree) noun

   A victory won at a too great a cost.

[After Pyrrhus, the king of Epirus, who suffered staggering losses while
defeating Romans.]

   "With lawsuits multiplying like crazy and mutual accusations of stealing
   the election spiralling out of control, almost any result now looks as if
   it will be a Pyrrhic victory."
   United States: Whatever Will They Think of Next? The Economist (London),
   Nov 25, 2000.

"One more such victory and we are lost," exclaimed Pyrrhus, the king of
Epirus, as he described his costly success in the battle of Asculum in
Apulia. With these words he gave us a metaphor to refer to a victory so
costly, it's hardly better than defeat. Yet, if we talk to those who lost
their sons, husbands, or fathers to war, every victory is a pyrrhic victory.
A war is perhaps the only occasion when killing  a person is not only
accepted but rewarded. If only we could learn to do war with words, instead.
Till then, let's look at a few words of war.                         -Anu

I have discovered that all human evil comes from this, man's being unable

fata morgana (fata mor-GAH-nuh) noun

   An optical phenomenon that creates the illusion of water, often with

[Italian, mirage, Morgan le Fay (from the belief that the mirage was caused
by her witchcraft) : fata, fairy (from Vulgar Latin fata, goddess of fate)
+ Morgana, Morgan, probably from Old Irish Morrigain.]

   "It is too early in Go-Go to have predictable, controllable results, and
   a bonus based exclusively on a formula of controllable and achievable
   results is a fata morgana."

scart (skart) verb tr., intr.

   To scratch, scrape or scar.

[Metathetic variation of scrat, to scratch.]

   "But despite extensive renovation, traces of barbed wire still scart its
   walls."
   Lisa Nipp, Little Sisters, World & I, Jan 1996.

When you hear someone pronouncing "ask" as "aks" or "pretty" as "purty",
do you find yourself looking down your nose? Not so fast! What you're
witnessing is the English language busy at work, mutating, evolving, and
refurbishing its wordstock, making things easier to pronounce. Known as
metathesis, it is the same process that gave us dirt (from drit) and curd
(from crud!). If you ever used the word flimsy, you did it: the word is
the metathesized form of the word filmsy. It is somewhat like our friend
spoonerism, except that here the letters or sounds get transposed within
the same word. Many everyday words appear in a form created by such
interchange of letters: the word bird came from Old English brid, third
from thridda. Going back to "ask," here is an interesting twist. The word
"ask" itself came from Old English forms acsian and ascian that co-existed.
Eventually the former won over and became standard. So what we are seeing
here is history repeating itself. A few hundred years and who knows, we
may be exhorting, "Aks not what your country can do for you ..."

This week we'll look at a few more words that are metathetic forms of
former words.                                                  -Anu

[After Andr? Maginot (1877-1932), French Minister of War during World War II
who proposed a line of defense along France's border with Germany. Believed
to be impregnable, the barrier proved to be of little use when Germans
attacked through Belgium in 1940.]

   "France has no shortage of linguistic generals who seek to regiment
   French and see an enemy lurking behind every new word or phrase. Yet what
   security do they bring? Franglais continues to infiltrate French ranks,
   despite a Maginot line of laws, word-vetting committees and diktats from
   the Academie Francaise."
   Ado Cherche Appart, The Economist (London), May 11, 1996.

   "Absent some sober rethinking, forward engagement is likely to produce an

   2. A grossly immoral act; a sin.

[Middle English iniquite, from Old French, from Latin iniquitas, from

   the pledge by the party administering it. Another is to accept the
   interpretation of the weaker party, where there are two interpretations
   possible. Rejection of these two rules gives rise to strife and
   iniquity, which are rooted in untruthfulness."

Annie Oakley (AN-ee OK-lee) noun

   A complimentary ticket; pass.

[After Annie Oakley (1860-1926), U.S. markswoman, renowned for her skill at
shooting, from the association of the punched ticket with one of her
bullet-riddled targets.]

   "If you're lucky, you've got an Annie Oakley."
   Tom Rouillard, Big Top Goes Up Today, The Herald (Rock Hill, S.C.),
   May 1, 1996.

This is going to be an eponym week, where we'll see words derived from
people's names. In our quest for eponyms, we are going to visit, among
other places, 18th century England, World War II era, and the American
Wild West.

Phoebe Ann Moses, better known as Annie Oakley, showed sharpshooting
skills at an early age and earned the moniker "Little Sure Shot." Later
this shooting star and her husband appeared in the touring Wild West
Show, delighting audiences the world over. Annie was known for amazing
feats such as shooting a coin tossed in the air, and knocking the ashes
off a cigarette held between her husband's lips. I think it would have
been more spectacular if she had knocked bff the whole cigarette, not
just the ashes, but I digress. In another stunt, she would shoot at a
playing card thrown into the air, and before it touched the ground,
riddle it with holes. I wonder if chad came out. Someone figured this
matched the punched free ticket to an event, and soon all passes became
known as Annie Oakleys.                                           -Anu

ahimsa (uh-HIM-sah) noun

   The principle of noninjury to living beings.

[Sanskrit ahimsa : a-, not + himsa, injury (from himsati, he injures).]

   "As my conception of Ahimsa went on maturing, I became more vigilant
   about my thought and speech. The lines in the Anthem:
       Scatter her enemies
       And make them fall;
       Confound their policies,
       Frustrate their knavish tricks
   particularly jarred upon my sentiments of Ahimsa."
   M.K. Gandhi, The Story of My Experiments With Truth, 1927.

Today is October 2, the day Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born in the year
1869. A man born some two centuries ago may appear irrelevant to our age,
but in reality his life and message are still applicable to our lives today.
As opposed to being a tale of great achievements, as most autobiographies
are, his `Story of My Experiments With Truth' is a collection of
introspections and experiences in his search for truth. "Let us not reduce
the standards of truth even by a hair's breadth for judging erring mortals
like myself," he writes in the introduction.

In a world where success is measured by what kind of car one drives, how
lavish a house one lives in, can we learn something from a man who got by
with just a loincloth?

Subject: Syzygy

My father used to give me a word a day when I was little. Once he gave me
syzygy. In Kindergarten when Sister Mary Angela told us all about the
dictionary, she told us we could look up any word. Even Dog or perhaps Cat.
She asked for a word, and I, brave little 5 year old said "Syzygy!" She
smiled a controlled smile, and said, Ah, we don't know yet about a thing
called VOWELS. My dear, certainly you can think of another word." Nope,
it's in there. S-y-z-y-g-y, Sister, I promise!" It was, of course, and at
the early age of five I was branded a smart mouth.

So use the word carefully.
Thanks.

Subject: five or seven days

Since the poll was so close isn't there a possibility of arranging for those
who want to get your great service seven days a week to do so? Or would it
require too much work? For instance, what about newspapers which use AWAD?
Alternatively, those who want 'a dumb' weekend can just ignore AWAD or delete
it. And, also, is the majority always right?!
Bring back AWAD seven days a week, please!
Thanks,

   Since the announcement of the poll result, I've received a large
   number of messages expressing disappointment at the reduced frequency
   of AWAD mailings. I'm thinking about making AWADmail a regular weekend

Could you please give me the word that means a fear of 13 (the number 13)?

   Your question is timely as we just witnessed a Friday the 13th last week.

Your latest email arrived with a warning that it contained a picture. This
is the second time that this has happened. The first time I opened the email
and surprise! No picture. I did not open the second submission for fear of
vile (or viral) contamination. Has some dark force been diddling with your
server? Inquiring minds need to know.

   I've received similar messages from other AOL subscribers. We never send
   any attachments with the messages. Also we use a Linux server not Windows.
   You can't get a virus from us. AOL is not exactly known for following
   standards--it appears they are parsing text messages as HTML and then
   issuing spurious warnings about pictures. We'd rather send you a thousand

Peter Principle (PEET-uhr PRIN-suh-pal) noun

   The theory that an employee within an organization will advance to his
   or her level of incompetence and remain there.

[After Laurence Johnston Peter (1919-1990).]

   "To me, Randell personified the Peter Principle, a popular management
   theory of the 1970s which held that you rise to your level of incompetence
   - in other words, you keep getting promoted till eventually you find
   yourself in a job that's beyond you."

Stockholm syndrome (STOK-hom SIN drom) noun

   A phenomenon in which a hostage begins to identify with and grow
   sympathetic to his or her captor.

[After Stockholm where a hostage in a 1973 bank robbery became romantically
attached to one of her captors.]

   "Speaking of refugees, stories such as the Oct. 27 article reveal a sort
   of Stockholm syndrome among those imprisoned on our highways every day.
   We can only smile when we hear people explaining why they love their
   commute: `I focus on the day ahead,' `I listen to the radio,' or, our
   favorite, `I use the time to relax,' white-knuckle relaxation, no doubt!"
   Civilize our transport, The Providence Journal, Nov 5, 1999.

Consider the Stockholm syndrome if you have any doubt about the veracity of
the saying, `Fact is stranger than fiction'. In 1973, following a botched
robbery attempt, the perpetrator held four employees of a Stockholm bank
hostage in the bank vault. At the end of the five day captivity, police were
surprised to discover that the hostages were afraid of them and resisted
rescue. They had bonded with the robber, a prison escapee, and became
sympathetic with him. Later, they started a defense fund for him, testified
in his favor, and one of the female hostages even fell in love and became
engaged to him.

Of course, this phenomenon is not limited to the Swedes. Patty Hearst of the
US, heiress to the Hearst publishing fortune, was kidnapped in 1974 by the
Symbionese Liberation Army. She later joined her abductors and participated
in a bank robbery with them. More recently, an Indian Airlines flight was
hijacked and the passengers were holed up in the plane for more than a week.
At the conclusion of the drama, some passengers were heard saying about the
hijackers, `they were not bad people'.

Why do people turn around and begin to sympathize with their tormenters in
situations like these? It is one of the mysteries of the way the human mind
works. Perhaps it is a way for people to cope with the immense, immediate
stress of being in a situation where their lives depend on their captors. If
one threatens to shoot, and then doesn't, hasn't he done a favor to us the
mind apparently rationalizes. In a place devoid of external contact, the
view of reality becomes distorted and the victims may develop a fondness for
the only person in their life.

This week in AWAD we look at some of the syndromes, paradoxes, laws, and
principles that govern our minds.                                    -Anu

picayune (pik-uh-YOON) adjective

   1. Of little value or significance.

   2. Petty, small-minded.

noun

   1. A Spanish-American coin equal to half the value of a real (a silver
      coin).

   2. A small coin, especially a five-cent piece.

   3. Something or someone of little value.

[From French picaillon, from Proven?al picaioun, a small coin.]

   "One could criticize the book as having a progovernment bias, but such
   criticism would be picayune and, I believe, wrong."
   Hawley, F. Frederick, Terrorism in America: Pipe Bombs and Pipe Dreams.
   (book reviews), Social Forces, Mar 1, 1995.

   "Well, it is not supposed to be good form these days to dwell on the
   picayune personal problems, especially of Republicans, but, you know,
   I've never been much for form. So, of the speaker, Gingrich's three
   recent personal problems - his mother, his historian and his book -
   the book is potentially, I think, the most serious."
   Schorr - Reality Sets in for New Congress, Weekend Edition - Saturday
   NPR, Jan 14, 1995.

While Times, Journal, Post, Reporter, News, Voice, etc., are common as the
names of newspapers, there are many papers with rather offbeat words in their
titles, such as Crier, Bee, Pennysaver, and Reflector. The mergers and
acquisitions yield some remarkable names too. Q: What happens when the
Daily Reflector and the Sun News decide to merge? A: You get the Daily News,
and a sun reflector. The fact is stranger than fiction and there have been,
in fact, more peculiar fusions. In 1939, when two newspapers in Chattanooga,
Tennessee, combined, the result was perhaps a case of truth-in-advertising:
the News and the Free Press merged to become the News-Free Press. Well, maybe
it was a case of too-much-advertising.

In this week's AWAD, we have selected words from the names of newspapers.
Two examples of the newspapers with today's word in their names are the
Times-Picayune and the Picayune-Item. While the critics of some of these
newspapers may believe that they are so named because they deal in trifles,
we have different news. They are so named because they could then be bought
for a few cents, or because they originated from the town of the same name.
The former publication raises its flag in New Orleans, Louisiana, while the
latter calls Picayune, Mississippi its home. Incidentally, did you notice
the two newspaper names are near-anagrams?

While on this topic, let's clear a folk etymology along the way. No, the word
`news' didn't form from the initials of the four directions of the compass
(North, East, West, South). It came from the word `new' as in "What's new?"
-Anu

............................................................................
Don't discuss yourself, for you are bound to lose; if you belittle
yourself, you are believed; if you praise yourself, you are disbelieved.

indolent (IN-duh-lehnt) adjective

   1. Disinclined to exert oneself; habitually lazy. Conducive to inactivity
      or laziness; lethargic.

   2. Causing little or no pain. Slow to heal, grow, or develop; inactive.

[Late Latin indolens, indolent-, painless : Latin in-, not + Latin dolens,
present participle of dolere, to feel pain.]

   "Wherever it came from, the musical came with its hair mussed and
   with an innocent, indolent, irreverent look on its bright, bland
   face.
   Walter Kerr, On musical comedy, NY Herald Tribune, Sep 1, 63.

"I love mankind. It's the people I can't stand." Do you ever find yourself

   2. The fine payable to the king by the hundred where such a killing
      occurred, unless the killer was produced or the victim proved to
      be a Saxon.

ambiguity (am-bi-GYOO-i-tee) noun

   1. Doubtfulness or uncertainty as regards interpretation.

   2. Something of doubtful meaning.

[From Latin ambiguus, uncertain, from ambigere, to go about : ambi-, around +
agere, to drive.]

Ambigram: http://wordsmith.org/words/ambiguity.gif

AMBIGUITY
        Ambiguity is one of a handful of English words whose meaning
describes itself. In other words, "Ambiguity" is ambiguous. It refers, on
the one hand, to a situation of imprecision, of obscurity, because more
than one interpretation is possible. On the other hand, something ambiguous
can be understood perfectly well - but from more than one point of view.
        We are amused at the fable of the elephant and the six blind men,
each of whom understood the elephant to be a very different animal. But we
seem to lose that good-natured perspective just in time to assume that our
own point of view on the world is more accurate than that of many of the
other human beings on the planet. We avoid ambiguity as much as possible,
feeling threatened that it may expose our own point of view as merely an
option.
        But we should embrace ambiguity. After all, each of our eyes sees a
slightly different, two-dimensional, view of reality. Those two images are
synthesized by the brain into a single three-dimensional image, which we
think of as "more real" than a 2-D view. The more points of view we are able
to see, the more clearly we understand the world around us. Reality is
ambiguous. Ambiguity is synthesis.
        I like to think that looking at everything - not only words -
from alternate points of view, can enhance our understanding of the world
around us.

AMBIGRAMS
Ambigrams are words that can be read from more than one point of view.
I have been creating ambigrams as visual meditations on language--as
commercial graphics and as fine art pieces--for almost thirty years.
Anu has invited me to share my unique point of view on language with
his A.Word.A.Day audience. I certainly appreciate this opportunity. I
hope you will enjoy looking at words in this new way and find it both
entertaining and thought-provoking.

Each day this week, your AWAD regular mail will consist of an ambigram, a
paragraph or so about a particular word, exploring some unorthodox points
of view regarding its meaning.  As it really makes more sense to view the
ambigram first, and in a format that allows you to invert it, I suggest
that you print it out, so you can enjoy its symmetry and reversibility
before and while you read.          -John Langdon (langdojw@drexel.edu)

(This week's Guest Wordsmith, John Langdon, teaches in the College of
Design Arts at Drexel University in Philadelphia. For more information

Band-Aid (BAND-ayd)

   1. A brand of adhesive bandage with a gauze pad in the center, used to
      cover minor abrasions and cuts.

noun

   2. A makeshift, limited, or temporary aid or solution that does not
      satisfy a basic or long-range need.

adjective

   3. Serving as a makeshift, limited, or temporary aid or solution.

[From the trademark.]

   "A Maori health initiative to double immunisation numbers has been
   described as a band-aid solution by an Opunake doctor."
   Amy James, Maori health programme branded band-aid, Daily News (New
   Zealand), Sep 19, 1997.

"I'll FedEx you these documents today!" You have most likely heard people
say this when what they really mean is they will send the material by a
courier service, not necessarily the FedEx company. How many times have you
xeroxed documents without even checking whether the copier was made by the
Xerox company as it churned out the copies? Today I'm discussing a phenomenon
called genericide whereby a trademark becomes so popular that it is used as
a generic for the entire product category, not just as a specific brand name.

The success of a brand name is often a double-edged sword for the owning
company. Initially, a company's dream is to become so successful with its
product that customers use their brandname as a generic, "Need to ship your
documents overnight? Just FedEx them!" As the brand becomes more popular,
they struggle to protect it lest it gets watered down and becomes a generic--
a victim of its own success. Did you know the words adrenaline, aspirin,
celluloid, escalator, gramophone, granola, heroin, kerosene were all
trademarks once owned by companies? This week, AWAD will feature examples
of words that, once trademarks, now are dictionary entries: bona fide words
of the English language.                      -Stuti Garg (stuti@namix.com)

   Relating to declarations of war and treaties of peace.

[From Latin fetialis, a member of Roman college of priests, who performed
the rites in such matters.]

   fetial arts; therefore it may be Congress's place to dictate policy
   here."

   employed legalistic language and forms to demand reparations from the
   guilty party."

   Rome: War and Religion, The American Historical Review, (Washington, DC),
   Feb 1995.

bad tempered, unco-operative. Interestingly, it means something similar to

the new, weekend emptiness at AWAD. Beetle Bailey lectured Sarge about
"aglets" (shoelace ends), "bibcock" (faucet nozzle), "punt" (indentation at
bottom of wine bottles), and "duff" (decaying matter on forest floors). Was
this a subtle protest or perhaps divine intervention? And who will

sophomoric (sof-uh-MOR-ik) adjective

   1. Of or pertaining to a sophomore or sophomores.

   2. Suggestive of or resembling the traditional sophomore; intellectually
      pretentious, overconfident, conceited, etc., but immature.

[Alteration (probably influenced by Greek sophos, wise, and moros, dull),
of sophumer, from obsolete sophom, sophism, dialectic exercise variant of
sophism.]

   South Park: Bigger, Longer And Uncut, Cineman Syndicate Jul 6, 1999.
   "The story is too streamlined and dialogue is alternately sophisticated
   and sophomoric."

With back-to-school season here, it is appropriate to address learning and
the learned. While the study of science, math and history and other worldly
pursuits is worthwhile, it is also important to remember that what really
matters can hardly be taught. I'll part with the words of Kabir, a medieval
Indian mystic poet, who never set foot in a classroom. Here is one of his
couplets, rendered in my less than poetic translation:

  The world passes while reading tomes, none any wiser;
  Truly learned is the one who learns the meaning of love.

So welcome back to school with the thought that the true purpose of education
is to realize that love counts most. And remember that school never stops at
AWAD. This week let's learn words from the world of learning.           -Anu

hacker (HACK-uhr) noun

   1. A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems
      and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most users, who
      prefer to learn only the minimum necessary.

   2. One who programs enthusiastically (even obsessively) or who enjoys
      programming rather than just theorizing about programming.

   3. A person capable of appreciating hack value.

   4. A person who is good at programming quickly.

   5. An expert at a particular program, or one who frequently does work
      using it or on it; as in `a Unix hacker'.
      (Definitions 1 through 5 are correlated, and people who fit them
      congregate.)

   6. An expert or enthusiast of any kind. One might be an astronomy
      hacker, for example.

   7. One who enjoys the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming
      or circumventing limitations.

   8. [deprecated] A malicious meddler who tries to discover sensitive
      information by poking around. Hence `password hacker', `network
      hacker'. The correct term for this sense is cracker.

[Originally, someone who makes furniture with an axe.]

   "When Emmanuel Goldstein, who runs a hacker magazine called 2600, posted
   Johanssen's software on a website, eight media companies (including Time
   Warner, parent company of TIME) sued Goldstein ...."
   Lev Grossman, Digital Divisiveness, Time, Aug 28, 2000.

With the growing popularity of computers, the spread of the Internet and Web,
and the success of Linux, terms from hacker jargon are increasingly going
mainstream, though not always in the correct perspective.

The New Hacker's Dictionary is a fascinating compendium of words from the
worlds of computing, computer networks, and the people who inhabit them.
Last week's citation of Murphy's Law brought enthusiastic responses with
requests for more examples from this book which is available at
http://www.fwi.uva.nl/~mes/jargon .

This week we have terms from this lexicon that give us glimpses of the hacker
culture. Enjoy this geek-week and remember - hackers, though often maligned,
are good guys, they are not crackers.                                  -Anu

[Supposedly, a power other than the three estates (the Lords Spiritual, the

epizootic (ep-uh-zo-OT-ik) adjective

   Spreading quickly among many animals.

noun

   Such a disease.

[French epizootique, from epi- + Greek zoion animal.]

   "Nor can today's oldest oldster recall the `great epizootic' of 1872.
   This was a flulike disease that killed at least 20,000 horse-car horses
   in the nation. When the epizootic quit killing horses, inventive Americans
   sought new pulling power."
   Jack Goodman, 'Broadway Battleship's' Brief Run in New York, The Salt Lake
   Tribune, Jun 27, 1999.

   "Said Dr. Anthony Iton, director of health and social services for
   Stamford. 'We have window screens. We spend more time indoors. What that
   taught us was you can have a relatively intense epizootic in birds and
   mosquitoes and not have a human epidemic. Because of our behaviors, we
   protect ourselves from mosquitoes.'"
   Christine Woodside, Mosquitoes? Sure. Spraying? Unclear, The New York
   Times, May 27, 2001.

Author and humorist Mark Twain once observed, "The difference between the
right word and the almost right word is the difference between lightning
and a lightning bug." Open a newspaper or magazine and chances are you'll
read about the frightening "epidemic" of mad cow disease. Of course, it is
we who are mad when we feed these herbivore animals body parts of other
animals, including other cows, but I digress. With today's word we know
the right term to use when it comes to an animal disease. The root dem(os)
in the word epidemic, meaning `people' is the same root that gave us the
word democracy. Here are two other words with their animal equivalents:
endemic/enzootic and demography/zoography.

In this week's AWAD, we'll look at some other less-known counterparts of
everyday words.                                                    -Anu

Those who dream by day are cognizant of many things which escape those who

   Szumigalski, Essays on Canadian Writing, Fall 1998.

[After Thomas Addison (1793-1860), English physician.]

   "He (Murray Kempton) enjoyed being in a group of reporters; he liked to
   try out ideas for columns, dropping fully formed Addisonian sentences into
   conversation to see which ones got a nod or a laugh. The winners turned up
   in the next day's paper."
   David Von Drehle, A Journalist's Singular Voice, The Washington Post,
   May 6, 1997.

Erratum: Monsieur Maginot, the eponymous subject of yesterday's word, was

If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds

dol (dol) noun

   A unit for measuring the intensity of pain.

[From Latin dol(or) pain.]

   "Minutes later it was still a comfortable four dol--what did they do, shut
   off the steam? Finally I removed my hand and examined my fingers: great
   blisters on thumb and finger."
   Richard Kopperdahl, Bettervue hospital, Village Voice, Oct 3, 1995.

One doesn't have to know the unit of pain to realize that the unit of joy
is not the dollar, or any other currency for that matter. We don't have to
look far to discover that some of the richest people on this planet are
not the most happy ones. Having lived in two not only geographic but also
economically antipodal places, I've met persons who were blissful and those
who were miserable, but their conditions were hardly a function of money.
Certainly it is good to have the means to pay for basic necessities, but
after that it's only a series of zeros in some account.

English author Samuel Butler once said, "Words are like money; there is
nothing so useless, unless when in actual use." We can't do much about
circulating money (which I hope you have plenty of), but we do try our best
to put words in actual use. This week it is those words that make one say,
"I didn't know there was a word for that."                          -Anu

congeneric (kon-juh-NER-ik) adjective, also congenerous

   1. Belonging to the same genus.

   2. Of the same kind or similar in nature.

noun

   A company offering closely related services.

[From Latin, con- together + gener- race.]

   "Some taxonomists have considered Elephas and Mammuthus to be quite close,
   even congeneric; thus, an Asian elephant living today in Thailand is more
   closely related to the extinct mammoths of North America than to its
   African cousin."
   Paul Martin and David Burney, Bring Back the Elephants, Whole Earth,
   Spring 2000.

   "`Merely putting together a financial services congeneric with all the
   constituent parts does not guarantee success,' Mr. Cleghorn said in a
   speech."
   Jeffrey Kutler, First Union Chief's Assertions Rile Skeptics on Benefits
   of Size Series, American Banker (New York), Dec 10, 1997.

concern shows--a good number of people sent their votes for five to indicate
that we, the people at Wordsmith, should take some time off.

Here are some selections from the comments that came with the ballots.
(Ballot, from Italian ballotta, a small ball used to register a vote.
So for this poll, maybe I should call these emailots).          -Anu

   If you go to five, you'll have to change the name of this valuable
   mailing to FWAW. Scott Murphree-Roberts

   I'd vote with the Beatles - eight days a week! Please don't stop AWAD at
   weekends! Barbara Cooper, Rome, Italy

   With so many words to learn, we need at least seven days a week.
   Helen Slade

   Oh, Like I'd Just Stop BREATHING on Weekends?
   More work for you, more fun for me. Seems like a no-brainer to me!
   Thanks for the great service! Hampton G. Miller

   In the Middle East, Thursday and Friday are the weekend. Here in New
   Zealand, our Monday is your (North American) Sunday. The "weekend"
   therefore stretches from Thursday to Monday. Seen from a global
   perspective (which is the only reasonable view to take on a language as
   ubiquitous as English) the issue is therefore meaningless. Regards,
   Philip Gould

   I like 7. I enjoy the email, and use it to verify that my email is up and
   running. Audrey Calvo

   If, like the gallant little tailor, you're up to seven at a blow, so am I!
   Heartfelt thanks for 'A word a day' and AWADtalk -- the highlights of my
   day! Cheers, Paulb

   Take a break on weekends! Give me time to absorb all the wonderful new
   words you have sent during the week! Maddytg

   Take the weekend off. Although I will miss the extra two entries, I'd
   rather see you conserve your efforts. I would hate to see this wonderful
   service burn out because of fatigue. Jane Dinielli

   Have weekends free. I think AWAD is great, but I also think you deserve
   time off. I hope enough others agree! Art Funkhouser, Bern, Switzerland

   I say take a break but I really love your programme - even if it does
   spell the American way, eh? Rod Dawson, Canada

   I love wordsmith. I feel smarter, look smarter. But I want to be dumb on
   weekends and find that I don't pay attention as much. Please don't think
   that we don't love you as much as ever just because we want slightly less
   of you. Janice Heilmann

verboten (vuhr-BOHT-n) noun

   Not allowed; forbidden.

[From German, past participle of verbieten, to forbid.]

WordPix: http://wordsmith.org/words/verboten.gif

   "After his third surgery on the wrong side of the brain, Dr. Cerebrum was
   declared verboten anywhere near the operating room, and his practice was
   limited to treating toe-nail fungus."

so that they do their own show-and-tell. With each word this week, I'll
give you the URL of an image that shows its WordPix. Without further ado,
let's see some words and let them talk about themselves. Instead of giving
citations from newspapers, magazines, and books, this week I'll write usage

oniomania (O-nee-uh-MAY-nee-uh, MAYN-yuh) noun

  Excessive, uncontrollable desire to buy things.

[From Latin, from Greek xnios, for sale, derivative of onos, price, + -mania.]

   "Usually, oniomania leads to financial problems, such as overspending on
   credit cards and bad credit ratings."
   Just Ask Us, Current Health 2 (Highland Park, IL), Mar 2, 2001.

Oniomania is another word for the urge to shop till you drop, habit of the
debit, thrill of the bill. According to a pearl of ancient wisdom, we don't
acquire things, things acquire us. In the case of oniomaniacs, it is perhaps
the fun of acquiring things that acquires them. Imelda Marcos of the
Philippines could be one prime example of this category, also known as
shopaholics, though she could be better known as a shoeaholic.

This week we'll look at some more uncommon words with common suffixes. -Anu

Murphy's Law (MUR-feez law) noun

   The facetious proposition that if something can go wrong, it will.

[Americanism, after a fictitious Murphy, allegedly the name of a bungling
mechanic in U.S. Navy educational cartoons of the 1950s.]

   "In the original, Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis played the Kellermans from
   Ohio, a nice couple whose trip to the Big Apple becomes the ultimate
   fulfillment of Murphy's Law when they lose their luggage, their hotel
   room, their money and their good names."
   Dann Gire, Get out & stay out!, The Daily Herald, Apr 2, 1999.

Here is a second opinion on Murphy's Law. This one is from The New Hacker's
Dictionary, Third Edition, compiled by Eric S. Raymond.            -Anu

   Murphy's Law /prov./ The correct, *original* Murphy's Law reads:
   "If there are two or more ways to do something, and one of those ways can
   result in a catastrophe, then someone will do it." This is a principle of
   defensive design, cited here because it is usually given in mutant forms
   less descriptive of the challenges of design for lusers. For example, you
   don't make a two-pin plug symmetrical and then label it `THIS WAY UP'; if
   it matters which way it is plugged in, then you make the design
   asymmetrical.

   Edward A. Murphy, Jr. was one of the engineers on the rocket-sled
   experiments that were done by the U.S. Air Force in 1949 to test human
   acceleration tolerances (USAF project MX981). One experiment involved a
   set of 16 accelerometers mounted to different parts of the subject's body.
   There were two ways each sensor could be glued to its mount, and somebody
   methodically installed all 16 the wrong way around. Murphy then made the
   original form of his pronouncement, which the test subject (Major John
   Paul Stapp) quoted at a news conference a few days later.

   Within months `Murphy's Law' had spread to various technical cultures
   connected to aerospace engineering. Before too many years had gone by
   variants had passed into the popular imagination, changing as they went.
   Most of these are variants on "Anything that can go wrong, will"; this is
   correctly referred to as Finagle's Law. The memetic drift apparent in
   these mutants clearly demonstrates Murphy's Law acting on itself!

This week's theme: syndromes, paradoxes, laws, and principles.

Experience is that marvelous thing that enables you to recognize a mistake
when you make it again. -Franklin P. Jones

   2. A confused heap; a tangle.

[Italian, from Old Italian, from imbrogliare, to tangle, confuse : in- +

Risorgimento (ri-sor-juh-MEN-toh, ree-zor-jee-) noun

   1. The period of or the movement for the liberation and unification of
      Italy (1750-1870).

   2. risorgimento. Any period or instance of rebirth or renewed activity;
      resurgence.

[Italian, from risorgere, to rise again, from Latin resurgere.]

   "Interestingly, Saba believed that his poetry would be understood only
   when a new Risorgimento took place, that is when `Petrarchan values
   (which are related to death) ... once again give way to Dantean values
   (which are those of life).'"
   John Taylor, Songbook: Selected Poems, Poetry, Jun 1999.

Apart from its massively dominant importance in the world of music, where
directions for form and expression are customarily written in Italian
(concerto, allegro, andante, rubato, etc.) and, more recently, the
shallower domains of popular movies, TV and best-selling novels, which
have given us a host of Mafia-derived terms, the contribution of the
language of Dante to English is far more useful and subtle than many of
us may realize. Whether the subject is philosophy, politics, diplomacy,
religion, sport, or even chess, we may thank the Italians for having
coined the just-right words we lacked in English until they came along
to help us out. Like their wonderful food -- there's another word-subject
for you -- we have merrily gobbled these words up and incorporated them as
our own, as English always does. This week's theme thanks the Italians for
helping up express ourselves more colorfully and precisely. Maybe we should
put that in italics.  -Rudolph Chelminski (RudyChelminski@compuserve.com)

excelsior (ik-SEL-see-uhr) noun

   Slender, curved wood shavings used especially for packing.

[Originally a trade name.]

   "In a glint of needle light, of grass seeds, dew flecks, a friend is
   throwing her voice
   While far inside a grainy heaven a butcher's apron ripples its dried
   blood in the wind.
   The bark strippings, excelsior, the panicles of the garden. In the midst
   of summer a friend cuts greens and places them in a bowl as if they were
   fronds.
   A friend is a vinegar - and now, pearl-shaped, in clusters, faces among
   her face,
   A globes rise on the lawn, each above a root of recriminations."
   Garden solstice. (poem), The Antioch Review, 1 Jun 1996.

sextet (seks-TET) noun

   1. A group of six.

   2. A group of six singers or musicians, or a piece of music composed for
      them.

[Alteration of sestet, influenced by Latin sex, six.]

   "With the local hockey sextet locked in a Stanley Cup series it would be
   loyal to stop by and pick up a six-pack."
   Dick Kreck, Raise a Glass to Avs, The Denver Post, May 18, 2001.

The word sextet has nothing to do with sex, unless of course, the six people
in question engage in some questionable calisthenics. That's what the English
language does--often leading us on only to make things limpid in the end.
There we go again. Take the word friable, for instance. All evidence leads
us to suggest this word could be used to refer to raw potato chips. But in
truth, something friable is that which could be easily crumbled. Well, it
could be used to refer to potato chips, after all. This week's AWAD visits
these red-herring words, words with meanings that are not the first things
that come to mind.                                                    -Anu

full monty (ful MON-tee) noun, adjective; Also Full Monty, full Monty

   1. Everything that's needed or possible or appropriate: the whole nine
      yards.

[Origin unknown.]

   2. Complete nudity.

[Popularized by the 1997 movie of the same name where a group of unemployed
steel-workers turn to stripping.]

   "However, I found it easy to get comfortable with the toolkit by building
   a full-featured NT with all the goodies (the Full Monty configuration)."
   James Metzger, Using Windows NT Embedded 4.0, Dr. Dobb's Journal (San
   Mateo), Apr 2001.

A couple of weeks ago, the folks at the Oxford English Dictionary decided to
add a few hundred words to the dictionary. That would not be newsworthy in
itself -- the online edition permits incorporation of new words easily and
the editors of the dictionary continually assay new words alphabetically
and add them to the dictionary. What's unusual is that this time they decided
to add the words out-of-sequence, words that otherwise would have to wait for
their turn to be anointed into the lexicon.

Unlike French, the English language needs no nanny's nod to call a word
a word. If a word fills a need, it is a word, no matter whether it's in
a dictionary or not. Still, the inclusion of these words in the OED,
the most venerable around and a true lex icon, does help give writers
their editors' imprimatur to use these words. As can be expected, a
disproportionate number of these new words hail from the Internet. Many
of these terms may appear slang, but we should remember that today's
revolutionaries are tomorrow's conservatives. So use these words in your
writing and conversation with the official seal of approval from the OED.
This week's AWAD features five of these.                         -Anu

[From Latin anilis, from anus old woman.]

   "The desire of AngloSaxon Australians to avoid `giving offence' through
   the spoken word is amply seen in compulsory speech codes in the ABC and

   priggishness of the Puritan marm, lips pursed, seeking nits to pick.'"
   Andrew McIntyre, PC? Non merci!, IPA Review (Melbourne) 1996.

philosophaster (fi-los-uh-FAS-tuhr, fi-LOS-uh-fas-tuhr) noun

   A pseudo-philosopher.

[From Late Latin, philosopher + -aster, a pejorative suffix indicating
something that is inferior or mimics another.]

   "I allude more particularly to you, O stolid philosophaster, who presume
   to style yourself a practical chemist, a good philosopher, and yet are
   entirely destitute of all knowledge..."
   Arthur Edmund Waite, The Hermetic Museum, 1893.

The pejorative prefix -aster (meaning something that is inferior, small or
shallow) gives us some delightful words when it comes to name-calling. A
reviewer brands a poet a poetaster (an inferior poet) and the reviewee might
return the favor by calling the former a criticaster (an incompetent critic).
In the same vein, we can have a politicaster, an astrologaster, and the bane
of writers everywhere--a grammaticaster. Lest we get carried away here, let's
remember that a grandmaster is not an inferior grandma. Well, enough of the
pretend-people. For the rest of this week, we'll review some other words to
describe people.                                                      -Anu

pandect (PAN-dekt) noun

   1. A comprehensive digest or complete treatise.

   2. pandects. A complete body of laws; a legal code.

   3. Pandects. A digest of Roman civil law, compiled for the emperor
      Justinian in the sixth century A.D. and part of the Corpus Juris
      Civilis. In this sense, also called Digest.

[Latin pandectes, encyclopedia, from Greek pandektes, all-receiving : pan-,
 + dektes, receiver (from dekhesthai, to receive, accept).]

   "These phenomena were memorialized in the novels of Zola, themselves
   accumulations between covers of a vast aggregation of sedulously
   recorded trivia. Flaubert had his contemporaries' number, however.
   Looking askance at this pretence to pandects, the empirical mastering
   of all knowledge on a given topic and the boiling it down to easily
   swallowed doses, he reduced it to absurdity in his savant idiots
   Bouvard and Pecuchet."

excelsior (ik-SEL-see-uhr) noun

   Wood shavings used for packing fragile items.

[From a trademark. From Latin, literally higher, from excelsus, high.]

   "In a glint of needle light, of grass seeds, dew flecks, a friend is
   throwing her voice
   While far inside a grainy heaven a butcher's apron ripples its dried
   blood in the wind.
   The bark strippings, excelsior, the panicles of the garden. In the midst
   of summer a friend cuts greens and places them in a bowl as if they were
   fronds.
   A friend is a vinegar - and now, pearl-shaped, in clusters, faces among
   her face,
   As globes rise on the lawn, each above a root of recriminations."
   Garden solstice, The Antioch Review, Jun 1, 1996.

The word excelsior is also the motto of the New York state:
http://50states.com/flag/nyflag.htm
It is also the title of a poem by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow:
http://bartleby.com/102/62.html
Of course, here they are not exhorting us to take inspiration from wood
shavings. Rather these refer to the Latin sense of the word. -Anu

dewlap (DOO-lap, DYOO-lap) noun

   A loose fold of skin hanging under the neck of an animal such as cow,
   rooster, lizard, etc. In birds this appendage is also known as a wattle.

[From Middle English dewlappe; dew, of unknown origin and meaning, + lap,

avid (avid) adjective

   1. Having an ardent desire or unbounded craving; greedy.

   2. Marked by keen interest and enthusiasm.

[Latin avidus, from avere, to desire.]

   "Global Exchange, for instance, is an outfit of 40 people based in San
   Francisco, and an avid believer in street protest."
   Angry and effective, Economist, Sep 23, 2000.

A popular motivational saying goes, "Desserts is stressed spelled backwards."
This is an example of a reversible word, which when read from the right
yields another word. All of this week's words exhibit this quality. Just like
reversible clothing that changes pattern when worn inside out, reversible
words result in other usable words. A special case of reversible words are
palindromes, which spell the same when reversed. So palindromes are a subset
of reversible words which in turn are a subset of anagrams. Another name for
reversible words is semordnilap, a self-referential word coined by reversing
the word palindromes.

Some words coined in this manner have actually entered the dictionary. Here
are two examples: YOB (a rowdy youth), coined by reversing BOY, and MHO
(former unit of conductance), coined by reversing OHM, the unit of electrical
resistance.

Taking inspiration from the above desserts/stressed saying, can you coin a
pithy aphorism using some word and its semordnilap? Don your wordsmith hats
and send your gems to anu@wordsmith.org. Original entries only, please. I'll
publish selected ones here in a compilation next week. Here is a helpful
hint: you can elicit semordnilapic quality in many words by forming their
plural, past tense, etc. Also, semordnilaps are especially useful in creating
longer palindromic words. Here is a simple example, "Devil Dennis sinned,
lived." Can you come up with something more interesting? Email them to the
above address.                                                      -Anu

syzygy (SIZ-uh-jee) noun

   1. Astronomy. Either of two points in the orbit of a celestial body where
      the body is in opposition to or in conjunction with the sun. Either of
      two points in the orbit of the moon when the moon lies in a straight
      line with the sun and Earth. The configuration of the sun, the moon,
      and Earth lying in a straight line.

   2. The combining of two feet into a single metrical unit in classical
      prosody.

[Late Latin syzygia, from Greek suzugia, union, from suzugos, paired : sun-,
syn- + zugon, yoke.]

Ambigram: http://wordsmith.org/words/syzygy.gif

SYZYGY
This curious word comes from the Greek language, where it meant the yoking
of two oxen. Over the eons, it came to mean the joining of any two entities
without losing the individual characteristics of either one. This idea brings
the yin/yang symbol to mind, and also the ambigrammatic phenomenon of two
letters being joined into one shape without loss of their readability. In
astronomy, however, "syzygy" is defined as an alignment of three heavenly
bodies in the solar system, more like the periodic alignment of the three Ys 
in
the word. How could a word that once implied the pairing of two entities come
to refer to the alignment of three?

        The answer comes in the fact that in science, no phenomenon can be
investigated without taking into account the presence of the investigator.
And when two heavenly bodies are seen to be in alignment, they are being
seen from a third, which is necessarily in the same straight line. So
no matter which way you look at the syzygy ambigram, it satisfies both sides
of its ambiguous definition.

gravity (GRAV-i-tee) noun

   1. The natural force of attraction exerted by a celestial body, such as
      Earth, upon objects at or near its surface, tending to draw them toward
      the center of the body. The natural force of attraction between any two
      massive bodies, which is directly proportional to the product of their
      masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between
      them. Gravitation.

   2. Grave consequence; seriousness or importance.

   3. Solemnity or dignity of manner.

[French gravite, heaviness, from Old French, from Latin gravitas, from
gravis, heavy.]

Ambigram: http://wordsmith.org/words/gravity.gif

GRAVITY
If it weren't for gravity, we wouldn't know which way was was up. Without
gravity to pull things "down," there would be no such thing as up or down.
This is an excellent example of the yin/yang idea that nothing exists except
in relation to its opposite. The opposite of gravity is weightlessness. A fair
conclusion: Gravity is the soul of wt.

As a parent of a three-year old daughter, I'm constantly besieged with
questions. While on an after-dinner walk, the enquiry comes up,
"Where's the sun gone?"
"He's sleeping."
"Why?"
"Because his mommy put him to bed."
"Why?"
"Because he has to go to pre-school tomorrow."
"Why?"
"Because he likes playing with his friends and teachers."
"Why?"
...
A few more whys later, I'm ready to confess ignorance. Such a small
question -- Why? -- yet so hard to answer. Fortunately, the whats are
easier to tackle. As it happens, the English language has a word for
almost everything around: from the ball on the top of a flagpole (truck),
to the spot on a die or a domino (pip), to the little circle that comes
out of a punched paper (we all know it by now). This week we'll look

Ambigram: http://wordsmith.org/words/philosophy.gif

PHILOSOPHY
        My fondness for ambiguity in language and its graphic
representation hurtles me headlong into the hallways of heady philosophy.
Like ambiguity, philosophy tends to scare a lot of people, and it does so
for the same reason. Maintaining a single point of view on an issue is
often the easiest path, but it is not consistent with a philosophical
spirit. After all, "philosophy" is derived from Greek words meaning, "the
love of wisdom" not "stubborn entrenchment." In fact, if one loves wisdom
and searches after truth, then one is required to look at things from more
than one point of view.

This week's theme: words with ambigrams.

energy (EN-uhr-jee) noun

   1. The capacity for work or vigorous activity; vigor; power.

   2. Exertion of vigor or power. Vitality and intensity of expression.

   3. Usable heat or power. A source of usable power, such as petroleum
      or coal.

   4. The capacity of a physical system to do work.

[French energie, from Late Latin energia, from Greek energeia, from energos,
active : en-, in, at + ergon, work.]

Ambigram: http://wordsmith.org/words/energy.gif

ENERGY
        Philosophers search for truth in much the same way that artists
do. They don't really expect to find any definite answers. They mainly want
to provide and investigate more ways of looking at the world. But scientists
differ slightly. Science strives to provide very definite, measurable and
provable truths. In the back of their minds though, scientists understand that
those truths are only temporary, and that they may very well be replaced
someday by another truth. So they're really not so different from artists
and philosophers after all.

        Einstein's Theory of Relativity has been accepted as a scientific
truth. But it has so far not been found to mesh with quantum physics. It
may very well be that the 21st century will modify one or both of those
truths as well. So for the time being, we can look at energy as mass times
the speed of light times the speed of light. From another point of view,
energy is the capability of a body to do work or produce an effect. It's
possible that the second definition will outlast the first.

spoliation (spo-lee-AY-shun) noun

   1. The act of pillaging and plundering.

   2. Seizure of neutral ships at sea in time of war.

   3. The deliberate destruction or alteration of a document.

[From Middle English, from Latin spoliation, past participle of spoliare,
from spoil.]

  "For raids to have an effect, as the Allies quickly learned, they had to be
   directed not against specific industrial installations but against entire
   urban centers. The Allied attack on Hamburg in late July 1943 was typical
   of the kind of spoliation that could be achieved. Half the city's
   domiciles were destroyed, as were 60% of its water system, 75% of its
   electricity generation and 90% of its gas works. Forty thousand Germans
   perished."
