TURQUOISE: DECEMBER'S BIRTHSTONE
======================================
The highest ranking among all the opaque stones, turquoise-
the "Turkish stone"-is highly prized throughout Asia and Africa,
not for its particular hoe of blue (a beautiful robin's egg or
sky blue) but more important for its supposed prophylactic and
therapeutic qualities.  The Arabs consider it a lucky stone and
have great confidence in its benevolent action.  Used in rings,
earrings, necklaces, head ornaments and amulets, it protects the
wearer from poison, reptile bites, eye diseases, and the evil
eye.  It was also believed capable of warning of impending death
by changing color.  Buddhists revere the turquoise because it is
associated with a legend in which a turquoise enabled Buddha to
destroy a monster.  Even today it is considered a symbol of
courage, success, and love.  It has also long been associated
American Indian jewelry and art.

Turquoise is an opaque, light to dark blue or blue green stone.
The finest color is an intense blue, with poorer qualities
tending toward yellowish green.  The famous Persian turquoise,
which can be very intense and pleasing blue, is considered a
very rare and valuable gem.  The United States (Arizona and New
Mexico) is also an important source of fine turquoise, and is
now the major source of turquoise used in jewelry worldwide.

All turquoises are susceptible to aging and may turn greenish
or possibly darker with age.  Also, care must be taken when
wearing, both to avoid contact with soap, grease, or other
materials that might discolor it, and to protect it from abuse,
since turquoise scratches fairly easily.

But exercise caution when buying turquoise.  This is a
frequently simulated gem.  Very fine glass imitations are
produced that are difficult to distinguish from the genuine.
Very fine adulterated stones, and reconstructed stones (from
turquoise powder bonded in plastic) saturate the marketplace, as
does synthetic turquoise.  Make sure you are buying "genuine,
natural turquoise."


THE DRESDEN DIAMOND: GREEN GLORY
=================================
The legendary 40.70 carat Dresden green diamond is now on
display at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C.,
right next to the Hope diamond, until January 10th of next
year--thanks to Ronald Winston, son of the 20th century's
most famous jewel merchant, Harry Winston.

Today the Dresden is to green diamonds what the Hope is to
blues; the most famous gem of its kind.  Estimated to have
lost at least 60 percent of its original 100-carat-plus
weight during cutting, this green giant takes the prize for
size as well as beauty.

Keep in mind that beauty in green diamonds is nothing like
beauty in emerald, jade, or green grossular garnet.  Natural
green diamonds are extremely uncommon occurrences, the result
of irradiation deep within the earth.  And when they are found,
most are pale in color and light in tone, running a hue
spectrum from apple to algae green.  Don't expect these
diamonds to sport stop light or shampoo-green colors.

Nevertheless, the Dresden is a marvel--from a standpoint of
both shading and size.  True, there are green diamonds
without the vibrancy muting gray of the Dresden, but their
far smaller size makes them seem tiny in comparison.  The
Dresden is such a behemoth, at least as far as green diamonds go,
that it sets a standard that will likely never be challenged,
let alone beat.

DO YOU WANT A COLORED GEMSTONE?
==================================
If you have ever wanted a gorgeous colored gemstone but
never knew how to find one, this is your chance to have one
hand picked for you.  In Tucson, Arizona during the first
weekend of February, the country's largest colored gem
trade show brings gem wholesalers from all over the world.
We will be attending the show to hand select the nicest
gems possible for our customers.

There are hundreds of booths of gems including: ruby, emerald,
sapphire, garnet, amethyst, tourmaline, jade, peridot,
spinel, and tanzanite.  If you would like us to add your
name to our shopping list, give us a call and tell us what
you are looking for. Every year we make many customers'
dreams come true as we find terrific values on the highest
quality gemstones in the world.


MEN'S WEDDING BANDS
======================
While there are hundreds, if not thousands, of women's
wedding ring style, there are relatively few common style of
men's rings.  The vast majority of men prefer some type of
comfort fit wedding band.  The term comfort fit comes from
the rounded inside of the ring that helps eliminate the
sharp edges.  Comfort bands come in a variety of finishes
including polished, two tone, hand craved, and milgrain
edges.

For men, the choice seems to focus more on the width of the
band which can range from 2 millimeters wide alll the way
up to 12 millimeters.  Sometimes couples decide to get
matching bands and/or rings but generally each will pick
what they think looks best and is most comfortable to them.

While the current trend is for the use of platinum in
women's wedding rings, men are often surprised how heavy and
expensive a wide man's band is if it is done in platinum.
Yellow and/or white gold is still the preferred metal for men.

Because men tend to wear their rings all the time, the rings
tend to take much more abuse than a women's ring.  A women
will take her ring off to wash her hands, do the dishes,
or fix dinner.  Men leave their rings on to mow the yard,
fix the car, or participate in sports.  This is probably
why you don't see many diamonds in men's wedding bands--
plus the fact that men learn early that most families
can only afford one jewelry lover.

DIAMOND DISTRICT DANGERS
=========================
When we visit with customers, we often hear that they are
contemplating making a trip to the diamond district in New
York to shop for a diamond.  Many people have heard of the
major diamond trading center located on 47th Street in New
York and the myth is that you can get a good deal there.
In reality, the wholesale trading takes place high above
the street in high-security offices hidden from the public.

The vendors on the street are more skilled at taking your
money than anyone you will find in your community.  They
are fast taking, high pressure salesman who specialize in
letting tourist think they are getting a deal.  They often
sell uncertified diamonds and reply on the difficulty of
customers returning to the Diamond District as part of
their sales strategy.

We recommend you never buy from anyone in the Diamond
District in New York unless you are there with a trusted
retailer who takes you to the true dealers who are not
at street level.  Don't become another statistic of one
who got ripped off while trying to get a good deal in
the Diamond District.


ONLY BUY THE CLARITY YOU NEED
=============================
We see more and more customers being told they need
VVS clarity or they will be able to see inclusions in the
their diamond.  Why pay for something you can not see?

For all shapes except emerald, we suggest VS2 or SI1
as your minimum clarity requirement since with an SI1 you
can not see anything with your naked eye.  The truth is
that you can not see the difference between SI1 and all
the higher clarity grades except with a microscope.
Higher clarity than SI1 does not add to beauty of the
diamond, only the rarity and therefore the price.  By
starting with an SI1 clarity you will get a bigger
diamond and have a better selection for getting a great
cut.  The highest clarity grades cost more but are not
necessarily going to appreciate as much as the grades in
most demand such as VS2 and SI1 as explained at
http://www.dsourceva.com/investment.htm on our web site.
The reality is that the first speck of dust that settles
on the diamond has much more visual impact on the beauty of
the diamond than anything in a diamond that is at least a
certified SI1 clarity grade.


50% OFF SALE
========================
You have all seen the billboards and newspaper ads
advertising half off sale at your local jeweler.  It is
not uncommon for stores to mark up items 300-500% so they
can mark them half-price during a sale. It's no great deal
if you are paying 50%, let alone 150% over wholesale.

Don't fall for sales of any kind.  If a dealer can afford
to mark it down, then they marked it up too high at the
start.


PRICE CALCULATOR
================
Probably the most popular feature of our web site is the
diamond price calculator where shoppers can input a shape,
color grade, clarity grade, and carat weight to determine
an estimate of our price for that type of diamond.  If you
haven't tried it yet, check it out at:
http://www.dsourceva.com/cost.htm#calc


FAMOUS DIAMONDS
===============
Name The Star of Sierra Leone
Weight: 968.90 carats rough

Valentine's Day, 1972.   A routine workday at the diamond
mine in Sierra Leone.  Suddenly, a company engineer and a
plant security officer spot something big on the grease table
(grease sticks to diamonds and is used to separate diamonds
from ore).  At first, neither man could believe what they
saw.  There, trapped by the grease, is a huge diamond, the
size of a hen's egg.

When the stone is first offered for sale, none of the sealed
bids reaches the minimum price of more than $2.5 million set
by the government.  Finally, months later, Harry Winston
makes a deal for the Star.  Winston wants a world-class
diamond from his rough.  A 143.20 carat emerald cut is
fashioned, but upon close examination, it reveals inclusions.
Winston changes his mind, deciding that flawlessness is
more important than size.

The big diamond is recut into seven smaller stones, the
largest of which weighs 32.52 carats.  Besides these, the
rough yields 10 other stones ranging from 1.85 to 53.96
carats.  All told, Winston recovers only 238.48 carats, a
staggering loss of almost 75 percent.  But 13 of the 17
finished stones are reportedly flawless.

GEM OF THE DAY
==================================
Keep smiling.  Even when life knocks you flat on your back,
you are still in a good position to look up.

BEWARE OF FRACTIONS
==================================
The FTC (Federal Trade Commission) allows jewelers to round
off diamond weights.  For example, a diamond labeled 3/4 carat
in weight might actually weigh anywhere between .69 and .81
carat.  While these are small weights, the price difference
can be significant.  For instance, if you bought earrings with
G color, SI1 clarity and 3/4 carat in each ear for $5160, you
might have over paid by $1600 if they really weight .69 carats.

Note: Jewelers are also allowed to be off one color and one
clarity grade.  If you don't purchase a certified diamond,
you could find yourself at the short end on weight, color,
clarity and therefore, value.

INTERNET SALES
==================================
Internet shoppers are expected to spend almost $20 billion
online during the 2000 holiday season, nearly double last
year's total of $10.5 billion, according to a recent survey by
the Gartner Interactive Firm.  About half that revenue is
expected to go to U.S. and Canadian e-tailers, with the rest
distributed among firms in Europe and Asia.

Robert Labatt, principal analyst for Gartner's e-Business
Services Unit, credits the increased willingness to do
business online to the e-tailers' extensive efforts in
increasing the customer's comfort level.  Chat rooms and
opportunities to interact with the internet firms are
encouraging more people to try this form of commerce.

DIAMOND GRADING TIPS: FLUORESCENCE
==================================
Fluorescence, if present in a diamond, will be indicated on
a diamond grading report.  It will be graded very faint,
faint, medium, strong, or very strong.  Some reports
indicate the color of fluorescence as blue, yellow, white,
and so on.  A stone with yellow fluorescence should sell
less since it will appear yellower than it really is when
worn in daylight or fluorescent lighting.  The presence of
blue fluorescence will not detract, and in some cases may
be considered a bonus since it may make the stone appear
whiter than it really is in daylight or fluorescent
lighting.  However, if there is very strong fluorescence,
there may be an oily or milky appearance to the diamond.
We recommend avoiding medium or strong fluorescence since
it is just not worth taking the chance of lower value.


BOW TIE
=======
One of the most obvious indicators of poor proportioning
in fancy shaped diamonds is the bow tie, or butterfly effect,
a darkened area across the center or widest part of the
stone, depending upon the cut.  The bow tie is commonly
seen in the pear shape or marquise but may exist in any
fancy shape.  Virtually all fancy shapes cut today will
exhibit some minimal bow tie effect.  Nonetheless, the
presence or absence of a bow tie is an indicator of proper
proportioning.  In poorly proportioned stones there is a
pronounced bow tie; the more pronounced, the poorer the
proportioning.  The less pronounced the bow tie, the better
the proportioning.  The degree to which the bow tie is
evident is the first indicator of a good or poor make (cut).


DIAMOND AND JEWELRY BOOKS
=========================
One of the best ways to be a better shopper for diamonds and
fine jewelry is to read one or more of the great books
listed at the following web page:

Subject: Price Corrections for the 16 November 2000 Day-Ahead Market



PSEG shares the concerns that have been raised on this tie list concerning
the price correction to the November 16 DAM market.  In addition to clearly
explaining exactly what happened, we request the ISO address the following
issues at the November 30 BIC meeting:

1.  How, if this was an error, did it get so far into the SCUC process -
especially given the impact it had on system prices?
2.  Explaining exactly what authority the ISO is acting under in eliminating
the "problem" bid.
3.  Defining the time frame of all actions taken involving this transaction
(i.e., will you provide participants with a time-line from beginning to end
with these transactions)
4.  Outlining the security issues that will be taken to insure the data
integrity and time stamps associated with all levels of this transaction,
including MIS data and correspondence between the participant and the ISO.
5.  Assuring the market participants that the financial implications and
credit restrictions on the bidding entity were NOT the driving force behind
changing prices (the impact of this could bankrupt certain market
participants - we want to know that this is not a concern the ISO is
addressing).
6.  In Jim's notification he states:  "The NYISO experienced software
anomalies with respect to the submission of these transactions that may have
contributed to the difficulties experienced in confirming the initial bids."
The word "may" in this statement infers there may be a doubt that there was
a direct connection between the software problem and the bids.   Will you be
committing in this meeting to exactly what caused the problem?

Ray

Alert Posted: 2:15  PM November 18, 2000  RE- (REVISED) Demand Mismatch Order 
Notice
Effective Monday, November 20, 2000 at 10:00 a.m., and until further notice, 
AGLC is issuing a demand mismatch order for the following primary pools. This 
notice is revised to include the Ex- Atlanta Southern Group
ATLANTA, EX-ATLANTA SNG,  MACON, AUGUSTA , and ROME
Based on the current supply levels and expected demand levels, AGLC's system 
cannot manage the potential excess demand and the operational integrity of 
the system will be threatened. Therefore, it is essential that your 
interruptible customer's demand does not exceed the scheduled supply for your 
interruptible market for each primary pool under the demand mismatch order.
Each shipper/pooler/marketer is responsible for contacting their 
interruptible customers to curtail demand if necessary to meet this order. 
Marketers/Poolers are responsible for maintaining interruptible customer 
contact information. Any customer contact information in GOS is for AGLC 
internal use and is not intended to be marketers/poolers point of contact for 
curtailments.

Well, Boys-

Turn out the lights, the party's over...  

I just thought I'd drop you guys an "official" note telling you that I am 
leaving Enron to take another position at a "Tier II" shop.  Hopefully, I 
will be able to help turn it around and make it a "Tier I" shop like Enron 
(Dreamers can dream, can't they?).  Anyways, I wanted you guys to know that I 
really enjoyed working with ya'll over the past year or so and really wish 
things could have worked out with the contract, salary, etc...  I really hate 
to have to move on because ya'll are such a great group and I have enjoyed 
working here with you so much however, I must pay the bills, keep the wife 
happy and keep me fed so, Off I go...

Well, Good Luck to you Guys and I look forward to talking to you Guys soon.  

BTW, Keep in touch for Happy Hours, etc (I am still willing to drink with you 
guys even though I am not a member of the Lazy E employment troop...) and 
please forward this to anyone I missed.

Late.

"Kirkpatrick, Joe" <joe.kirkpatrick@nrgenergy.com> writes to the 
NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Chuck

I have a question or two with regard to the following "Operational
Announcements" (Below). These are a few examples of many that are requests
for generation being requested out-of-merit by the NYISO for NYISO security.

In my limited understanding of the way SCD works I had thought that the only
reason the ISO or a Transmission Owner would request generation out-of-merit
is to resolve for a constraint or system condition that SCD could not (set
me straight if I am off-base).
Requesting generation out-of-merit to resolve for system security is an
effective method of quickly resolving for an out-of-scope SCD system problem
and by definition will not set clearing price.

1. What are the rules and procedures in place to request generation
out-of-merit both for local (Transmission Owner) and ISO request.
2. What other control actions have to be exhausted prior to initiating a
request for generation to be called on out-of-merit.
3. Are the generation bids available to the requestor(s) prior to making the
request. (Is economics a consideration?)
4. When load is available to be dispatched, will it be considered as a
control action instead of generation?
5. Is generation called on out-of-merit to resolve for DNI constraints.
6. In particular for Gilboa it was my understanding that prior to requesting
additional generation from Gilboa that an emergency was to take place. Is
there another agreement in place between the NYISO and NYPA. Below is an
excerpt from the ICAP manual.

4.4.2 Energy Limited Resources

Energy Limited Resources that are ICAP suppliers must be able to provide the
Energy equivalent of their claimed ICAP for four (4) hours each day. Energy
Limited Resources must bid or schedule in the Day-Ahead Market for
twenty-four (24) hours each day in such a way as to enable the NYISO to
schedule them for the period in which they are capable of providing the
energy.
An Energy Limited Resource must also provide the NYISO with information
concerning the hours during which it will be recharging or replacing
depleted
resources. Once the resource has provided four hours of Energy equivalent
ICAP, the NYISO will not call on an Energy Limited Resource during its
recharge
hours, except in the case of an emergency.

As an aside to this did NYPA declare the hours that it was not running on
May 8, 9 as recharge hours and conversely the hours that it was dispatched
by the NYISO. Was an emergency declared (as defined by NPCC).


I am seeking to get further detail in the operational announcements for both
local and NYISO requests for generation out-of-merit. If there are further
enhancements required for SCD in order to reduce the number of requests for
generation out-of-merit; what are they and when will they be implemented?

Given the growth in EES it has become apparent that it is time to consolidate 
the risk functions between EES and EWS.  This will provide EES with the 
systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups 
necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market 
opportunities.

With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk 
groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing, 
structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and 
back-office services.  These groups main function is to provide these 
services to EES.  We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice 
President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the 
Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will 
continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice 
President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the 
Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim 
Belden.

These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while 
ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading 
organizations.

These changes are effective immediately.  Please congratulate Rogers and Don 
on their new roles.

"Depillo, Raymond V." <Raymond.Depillo@pseg.com> writes to the 
NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Certainly the problem Don identified is legitimate and can still occur.
However, with the implementation of the ECAs we have seen a change in
bidding behavior at the interfaces - HAMs no longer bid at or near the caps.
Thus, by changing HAM prices of accepted DAM transactions to something like
+/- $500, you can be reasonably sure your transaction will flow.  If it
doesn't you may be far better off that it didn't.

The big concern I have with this is that it can again lead to huge
scheduling problems with neighboring control areas (once DAMs and HAMs are
all competing for the same space).  How is the ISO planning on better
coordinating with its neighbors - will lead times on accepted transactions
change?  Does the ISO have any comments?  Do we remember the letters that
were received from PJM - and can we afford scheduling snafus going into the
summer?

pmorrison@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:


Dear Market Participants,

The NYISO is pleased to inform you about the following
enhancements to the MIS, OASIS and BAS that will be
implemented on May 29, 2001.

* Changes will be made to the Market Information System (MIS) to
make in-hour curtailment prioritization of transactions more
consistent with the BME scheduling process. Specific changes will
be made to:
- the NERC / ranked ordering,
- the addition of message for ICAP recall,
- the exclusion of Federal contracts from ICAP transactions
recalled, and
- the inclusion of exports from LBMP reference bus as ICAP
transactions.

* Also, for a transaction with an external source, the decremental
dollar will no longer be calculated. Please see Technical Bulletin
#61 for more information regarding transaction curtailments.

http://www.nyiso.com/services/documents/techbulletins/index.html

* Changes will also be made to the MIS to remove the $20,000 bias
from day ahead external transactions.

* New data will be posted to the NYISO OASIS web site to enhance
the presentation of real time data. The elements being added to
the web site include zonal real time (5 minute) load values and
zonal forecast load values. Consistent with a resolution passed by
the Business Issues Committee (BIC), zones J & K will be combined.

* The Shared Activation of Reserves (SAR) package on the real time
system will be enhanced to accommodate support for Hydro Quebec
(HQ) wheel-through transactions.

* The NYISO Day-ahead Price Responsive Load Program will be
implemented in both the MIS and the Billing and Accounting (BAS)
systems. The Day-ahead Price Responsive Load program offers
NYISO Customers the ability to supply a bid to the MIS indicating
the cost at which it will reduce its demand by a specified number
of MWs. The program will make use of the existing bidding and
scheduling web pages and upload / download templates.  However,
you must register for this program. Contact your Customer
Relations representative for details. Documents containing
instructions with more details will be issued soon.

* Other changes to the Billing & Accounting system (BAS) will
incorporate changes to the Daily Advisory Statements that will
provide additional columns of information on the Power Suppliers
section of the advisory. Also, new CSV reports will be provided
that give more detailed load information and static sub-zone
definition. More information will be provided soon about a
software tool to filter this new data.  It will be provided for
Market Participants whose automated data retrieval systems are not
prepared to receive the revised Daily Advisory statement.

Change #'s:
SWHE-4WQLHZ; KKIR-4WQLHE; VLEE-4WQQGL; RDEY-4WTLS6; DCUK-4WRGYU

If you notice any NYISO systems behave other than intended after
the scheduled implementation date, please let us know immediately.

It will be helpful if you refer to this notice if you communicate with
us about these changes.

Thank you,
Customer Relations

EMERALD: MAY BIRTHSTONE
==============================
Emerald is a green variety of the mineral beryl.  One of the
rarest members of the beryl family-only the red variety
(sometimes called "red emerald") is rarer-it is one of the most
highly prized of all the gems.  Aside from being the birthstone
for May, it was historically believed to bestow on its wearer
faithfulness and unchanging love, and was thought to enable
the wearer to forecast events.

The highest-quality emerald has the color of fresh young green
grass-an almost pure spectral green, possibly with a very faint
tint of blue, as in the finest emerald from Columbia, which is
considered by connoisseurs to be the world's finest.  Other
sources include Brazil, Zambia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Russia
and India.  Flawless emeralds are rare, so their "flaws" have
come to serve almost as "fingerprints," while flawless
emeralds are immediately suspect.  Although a hard stone,
emerald will chip easily since it tends to be somewhat brittle,
so special care should be given in wearing and handling.

Techniques to enhance color and reduce the visibility of flaws
are also frequently used.  A common practice is to fill
surface-reaching cracks with oil (sometimes tinted green), a
practice that goes back to early Greek times.  Today's
emeralds are oiled using a vacuum/heat technology.  This is a
widely accepted trade practice, since it is actually good for
the stone in light of its fragile nature.  Oiling hides some
of the whitish flaws, which are actually cracks, filling the
cracks so they become less visible.  The oil becomes an
integral part of the emerald unless it is subjected to some
type of degreasing procedure.  The development and use of
the ultrasonic cleaner has brought to light the extensive-
ness of this practice.  Never clean emeralds in an
ultrasonic cleaner.

While oiling is considered an acceptable practice, be sure
the price reflects the actual quality of the stone.  If
necessary, most emeralds can be "re-oiled."


FAMOUS DIAMONDS
=========================

Name:   Uncle Sam
Weight: 40.23 carats (rough) and 12.42 carats (cut)
Color:  M (very light brown)
Clarity:VVS1
Shape: Emerald Cut

The Uncle Sam diamond, which was discovered in the "Crater
of diamonds" in Arkansas in 1924, is the largest yet found
in the United States.  Peiken Jewelers of New York City,
owned the Uncle Sam for many years.  For a while, it was
on loan to the American Museum of Natural History.  In
1971, Sidney de Young, a dealer from Boston, bought the
diamond and then sold it to an unnamed collector.


SEA DIAMONDS
===========================================
An enterprising Texan called Sammy Collins drew worldwide
attention in 1962 when he announced that he'd recovered
50,000 carats of diamonds worth $1.5 million from the
seabed off the treacherous Diamond Coast of South West
Africa.  Collins figured that since diamonds had been
found in abundant amounts along the coast, most likely
carried there by the Vaal and Orange rivers from some
far inland deposit, they also ought to be found under
the ocean.

Over a period of three years, Collins used the equivalent
of huge vacuum sweepers to suck some 400,000 carats of
diamonds from the seabed.  His adventures set off a
mini-rush by others to try this new type of exploration
but terrible working conditions and uncertain diamond
deposits sent most into early obscurity.

Today, with improved technology, De Beers and others are
once again probing the waters of the South Atlantic,
bringing closer the prospect of viable undersea
diamond recovery.


LOOKING FOR SOMETHING REALLY SPECIAL?
============================================
We will be attending the annual JCK Jewelry Show in Las Vegas
the first week of June.  This is your opportunity to get access
to wonderful designer jewelry at a fraction of regular retail
prices.  With almost 3,000 booths of diamonds and jewelry from
all over the world, this trade show brings the most beautiful
jewelry in the world to one place.

If you have special piece of jewelry you've always wanted but
didn't think you could afford, give us a call so we can find
it for you.  The same goes for color gem stones since we can
hand pick from the most beautiful colored stones in the world
for your special ring, pendant or bracelet.

While the Diamond Source of Virginia does not have an inventory
of diamonds or jewelry, we have accounts with the leading
wholesalers and designers across the country and can special
order your custom jewelry or pick it out in person at this show.
We go with our shopping list for our customers and return with
the best of the best.  If you have a special request, please
give Anne a call at 888-477-8385 and tell us what you want.


SI2 CLARITY
=========================
While we recommend at least SI1 clarity for most
diamonds to ensure they are "eye clean," many consumers
think that SI2 means nothing visible with the naked eye.
The following comments define the official GIA position:

"SI stones contain noticeable inclusions which are easy
(SI1) or very easy (SI2) for a trained grader to see
under 10X. Typical inclusions are included crystals,
clouds, and feathers, normally centrally located and
noticed immediately. A stone with an eye visible
inclusion can still be graded SI. You must consider the
size, nature, position, number, and color or relief of
the inclusion. The size and shape of the stone are
important too. Characteristics in the SI1 grade usually
are not visible to the unaided eye face-up.
Characteristics in some SI2 stones can be seen with the
unaided eye."

We find that over half of the SI2 stones have visible
inclusions to the naked eye. Note the above comments
say "visible to the unaided eye face-up." With most
shapes of diamonds, inclusions are often easily visible
from the side where there are few, if any, facets to
hide them. We just sent a VS1 clarity princess back to
the wholesaler because the inclusion, while not visible
face-up, was easily visible with the naked eye from the
side. You can imagine what the SI2 diamonds look like
from the side if they are visible face-up. If the
mounting hides the side of the diamond, these side
visible inclusions are not a problem. But most mountings
show off the side of a diamond and make them easy to see.

INSURANCE QUESTIONS
==============================
Most people do not realize that insurers differ widely in
what they offer regarding coverage and reimbursement or
replacement.  Many insurance companies will not reimburse
the "full value" provided in the policy but, rather,
exercise a "replacement" option--and will offer a sum in
cash less than the amount for which the jewelry is
insured, or offer to replace it for you.  Therefore it is
important to ask some very specific questions to determine
the precise coverage offered.  We recommend asking the
insurer at least the following:

1) How do you satisfy claims?  Do you reimburse the insured
amount in cash?  If not, how is the amount of the cash
settlement determined?  Or do you replace the jewelry?

2) What involvements do I have in the replacement of an
item?  What assurance do I have that the replacement will be
of comparable quality and value?

3) What is your coverage on articles that cannot be
replaced?

4) Exactly what risks does my policy cover--all risks?
Mysterious disappearance?  Am I covered in all geographic
areas?  At all times?

5) Are their any exemptions or exclusions?  What if the loss
involves negligence?  What happens if the diamond falls out?

6) What are the deductibles, if any?

7) What documentation do you expect me to provide?

Every week we hear yet another story of a customer who paid
insurance premiums for years and were shocked to discover
how little protection they really had when they did have a
claim.  Check the small print before you need it.


FOUR C'S
===========================
Diamond quality and value are determined by four factors.
These factors are called the "Four C's."  If we were to rank
them based on their importance in determining the value of a
diamond, we would list them as follows:

1) Color
2) Clarity
3) Cut and proportion
4) Carat weight

In terms of determining beauty, however, we would rank them
in a different order:

1) Cut and proportion
2) Color
3) Clarity
4) Carat weight

When diamond shopping, it pays to put your focus on cut and
proportion since this is where you get the most impact on
beauty while paying little premium in price.  We recommend
investing your dollars in beauty you see rather than rarity
and higher "quality" not visible to your eye.

BOW TIE
=======
One of the most obvious indicators of poor proportioning
in fancy shaped diamonds is the bow tie, or butterfly effect,
a darkened area across the center or widest part of the
stone, depending upon the cut.  The bow tie is commonly
seen in the pear shape or marquise but may exist in any
fancy shape.  Virtually all fancy shapes cut today will
exhibit some minimal bow tie effect.  Nonetheless, the
presence or absence of a bow tie is an indicator of proper
proportioning.  In poorly proportioned stones there is a
pronounced bow tie; the more pronounced, the poorer the
proportioning.  The less pronounced the bow tie, the better
the proportioning.  The degree to which the bow tie is
evident is the first indicator of a good or poor make (cut).


PRICE CALCULATOR
================
Probably the most popular feature of our web site is the
diamond price calculator where shoppers can input a shape,
color grade, clarity grade, and carat weight to determine
an estimate of our price for that type of diamond.  If you
haven't tried it yet, check it out at:
http://www.dsourceva.com/cost.htm#calc


DIAMOND AND JEWELRY BOOKS
=========================
One of the best ways to be a better shopper for diamonds and
fine jewelry is to read one or more of the great books
listed at the following web page:
http://www.dsourceva.com/books.htm


INTERNET MARKETING

how to get more visitors, check out some of the tools we have
found to help with internet marketing at:

1. how can NY resolve in the DAM more imports from ISONE than their own
TTC or more than ISONE's transfer limitation?
> I understand that there is no restriction on a Participant selling DA
and taking the risk of being able to deliver, but surely the software
should recognize the TTC limit and cut/prorate schedules based on price,
down to the TTC limit.  And I would presume that the two ISO's would
agree daily on the TTC limits between their respective pools, thus
ensuring that the DA transfers are always equal to or less than TTC..

2. how can we get the ISO's to coordinate something as simple as
transfer limits?
> At one time in my past life, the limiting control area's limit was the
TTC value used for both CA's....this must be on the SEAMS agenda...

Inquirying minds want to know....

Guys,

A couple of things to consider as you make plans for the meeting (end of 
April to early May, 2002) in Flagstaff, AZ.  You should probably take a rough 
count on attendees and confirm with the hotel there the meeting dates.  You 
should factor in any meetings that might interfere in that time frame (i.e., 
Managers/Directors Meeting, etc.).  Possibly Amelia Alder can tell you when 
any meetings like that might occur.   If you don't reserve space at the 
Little America (example: the time slot, meeting room and 60 hotel rooms, 
etc.) - you may find yourself blocked out by a convention or some other 
gathering that has the hotel booked.

Also, you should check with Kim Ladish to make sure Randy does not have any 
blockage for the dates you select.  Before you know it the time slots will 
fill up for guys like Randy.  

Also, I would approve and supply funding for your conservative purchase of 
some gift item from the Signature Shop (with Enron logo) for the attendees to 
take away from the meeting (enough to share with our SW Operating Partners 
that will join us for the second day of the meeting).  We can discuss what 
will be appropriate.  

A little planning ahead may save you some headaches later on, especially if 
you don't tie down the hotel space you will need for the meeting.  I believe 
you will have to get pre-approval from the Enron group that has to approve a 
meeting of this magnitude.  

John Shafer

**IMPORTANT**

All,

I didn't catch the impact of this when I first saw it last week, but NYISO
is making a change that should cause real time prices to increase (relative
to historical prices) in cases where bid load is less than real time actual
load.  They will be committing GTs in the reliability pass of SCUC at an
incremental cost of zero (instead of committing a steam unit), which
increases the likelihood that GTs will run in real time under these
conditions, increasing real time prices.  The change goes into effect today
or tomorrow.  See below.

Scott

Scheduled for 11/29/00 & 11/30/00
Change type - Enhancement
Description:
Billing System changes will be deployed to implement 10 minute,
non-synchronous and 10 minute, spinning lost opportunity payments.

Also, billing software deployment to allow PURPA Class 2 units to
participate in the LBMP market and not have their transactions
adjusted after the fact.

MIS change will enable web posting (via Operational Announcement)
in the event of a reserve pick-up.

SCUC and BME software modifications will include the following:
- SCUC modeling of Gas Turbines as zero cost capacity resources in
  the Forecast Load Commitment Passes of SCUC.
- SCUC and BME pro-rata scheduling of external transactions with
  equal bids in the event multiple transactions are marginal.
- SCUC and BME non-distributed scheduling of reserve suppliers in
  the event multiple suppliers are marginal.

Alert Posted: 11:00 AM December 1, 2000: Demand Mismatch Order Notice
Effective Sunday, December 3, 2000 at 10:00 a.m., and until further notice, 
AGLC is issuing a Demand Mismatch Order for ALL Primary Pools.
Based on the current supply levels and expected demand levels, AGLC's system 
cannot manage the potential excess demand and the operational integrity of 
the system will be threatened. Therefore, it is essential that your 
interruptible customer's demand does not exceed the scheduled supply for your 
interruptible market for each primary pool under the demand mismatch order.
Each shipper/pooler/marketer is responsible for contacting their 
interruptible customers to curtail demand if necessary to meet this order. 
Marketers/Poolers are responsible for maintaining interruptible customer 
contact information. Any customer contact information in GOS is for AGLC 
internal use and is not intended to be marketers/poolers point of contact for 
curtailments.

Larry,

I spoke with Darron Blackburn regarding the Burger, Crane, and Sonora
accounts.  Darron has told me that the blue fee return sheets indicate that
EOTT submitted zero fees for these three accounts.  Darron indicated that
these sites had either NSPS sources or an active Title V permit.  Therefore,
fees would be required.  A fee would not be required if there was no
intention of operating the sites in the 2002 fiscal year (September 1, 2001
through August 31, 2002).

1. If a fee is owed but the site did not operate in 2000, then EOTT would
owe the minimum fee - $26.
2. If the Title V was not officially terminated prior to Nov.1, then the fee
is required if the source operates in the fiscal year.

Our database shows Burger and Sonora to be out of service.  Therefore, a
2002 fiscal year fee would not be required.  This needs to be communicated
to Mr. Blackburn in writing.  Our database shows Crane to have all
grandfathered tanks.  Therefore, the only trigger for a fee would be an
active Title V permit.  Do you know if the TNRCC has voided the Title V and
if so when?

rstalter@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:



The following message has been forwarded to the Tech Exchange at the request 
of
Steven Keller of the NY PSC:


Statement of the Department of Public Service Staff to the BIC
Regarding Shortening the ICAP Obligation Procurement Period from Six
Months to One Month


The ICAP Working Group has proposed Phase II tariff language that
implements the BIC/MC decisions to implement a monthly ICAP obligation
procurement period (OPP) instead of the current six-month OPP.  It is our
understanding that this proposal is largely supported by incumbent load
serving entities who are currently required to purchase their ICAP six
month's in advance even though they expect to lose load to new entrants
during that period.  The LSE's are concerned that they may lose money
trying to sell unneeded ICAP back into the market.  Staff of the New York
State Department of Public Service (Staff) understands those concerns.

A report by the Brattle Group suggests that the existence of price caps in
New York could lead to capacity migration from New York under a one-month
OPP scenario.  Brattle suggests that under such a system certain
"optimistic" suppliers might choose not to offer to sell their ICAP to NY
if they think they could do better by selling energy into external markets
where they could earn high revenues in high demand month.   If that
happens, even to a limited extent, we believe it will likely result in
increased purchase costs for ICAP purchased both on a bilateral basis and
through the ISO auctions, and could also push up energy prices.

In a subsequent study by KEMA it is suggested that in order to avoid
capacity migration ICAP deficiency charges should be increased as much as
six-fold.  The obvious result would be that all LSE's would be exposed to
significantly higher deficiency charges under a
one-month OPP.  Staff does not view this as an acceptable alternative to
retaining a six-month OPP even with its potential that LSEs may incur a
loss as a result of purchasing ICAP for load they expect to lose.

As of November 29, 2000, the ISO has been unable to estimate the level of
deficiency penalties that would be required to avoid capacity migration
under a one-month OPP.  As a result, the New York State Department of
Public Service has been unable to verify whether the current levels need
to be increased, decreased or left as they are.  Because of concerns about
capacity migration, and because there is very little convincing argument
about the costs/benefits that would result from moving to a one-month ICAP
OPP that cannot at least partially be obtained from the six month OPP with
monthly deficiency auctions, Staff is opposed to such a change at this
time.   Until the ISO and market participants work out how to ensure that
energy and ICAP markets will remain workably competitive even during peak
periods, we believe it is prudent to move cautiously with regard to
shortening the OPP.

Subject: New Options Model

Meeting on May 30 at 3:30pm regarding the new Option Model we (Steve Wang, 
Harry Arora, and Rob Stalford) use to make markets.  The old structuring 
model was created for marketer to give indicative pricing.  I have created 
this model especially for option market making.  As market makers we found 
the old model too slow as we are often making bid/offers in more than five 
strikes in more than five different months.  This model allows us to make our 
markets quicker and identify mispricings in the market before our 
competitors.  This is not to replace the old structuring model.  It is only a 
complement that will give everyone a better picture of where options are 
trading and where bid/offers are.  We will publish these prices weekly and 
will eventually have them on a daily basis.

You will need special permission to access the files located in 
M:\power2\Options.  Let me know if you want access to this folder.  The

Please log on today or tomorrow to set up those that will be providing me 
feedback on your performance.  A few notes:

1.  Make sure you include Kayne.
2.  Make sure you include the Cash/Term trader with whom you have had the 
most contact within the last 6 months.
3.  Include several other hourly guys.
4.  Include others from other groups (for example: scheduling, settlements, 
origination, etc), but only if you have had professional contact within the 
last 6 months.

Subject:  PJM Announces CSS Training Program



Message sent from the pjm-customer-info mailing list at
pjm-customer-info@majordomo.pjm.com:

On June 12, PJM will implement the Collaborative Scheduling System (CSS), a 
new
scheduling tool designed to facilitate transaction schedules between New York
and PJM.
CSS will become part of the EES tool now used to schedule transactions from 
and
to PJM neighbors.

PJM will offer several two-hour "virtual" workshops to introduce the new 
system.
Participants who now use EES and will use CSS are encouraged to attend one of
these workshops.  The dates for the workshops are: May 31 at 10:00 a.m., June 
5
at 2:00 p.m. or June 11 at 2:00 p.m. The workshops will be presented on the
internet with audio teleconference.

A complete description of the new tool, the training program, and a 
registration
form for the program are available on the PJM web site at
http://www.pjm.com/training/css/css.html

has agreed to notify SPP prior to the top of each hour whether or not
they will be making any attempt to restore the IP agreement at the top
of the next hour.  Once that designation has been declared, SPP will
open the market at the top of the hour for next-hour only service to the
BLKW DC Tie.  SPS has stated that 12/12/2000 HE 19 will be available for
service.  A similar notice will be posted to the OASIS and SPP will
follow this policy until further notice.

barkerde@nmenergy.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:



What if a product called External Transmission Reservation Rights (ETRR) was
conjured up that would allow a MP to reserve in/out ISONY transmission ?
MP's bid on 50 mw blocks for a month. The numbers of mws made available is
variable. The winners get the blocks with a bid block attached. For example 
,on
the PJM/NY interface 100 mws of ETRR's  for exports were sold in two blocks of
50. The winner's are given the bid blocks of 9999 and 9998 respectively. The
highest anyone not owning a ETRR could bid on the external interfaces is +/-
9900 thus insuring the assigned bid blocks first acceptance of their bids. 
Thus
the winners of the ETRR's (having already paid the ISO for the space) have the
ability to schedule the energy or not. Obviously this is an idea in the most
simplistic form that will allow the purchasing of long term transmission in a
financial transmission market. What do you think???

I spoke with Eduardo Acosta at the TNRCC.  He has stated that if a turbine
is not subject to any NSPS or 30 TAC 117 requirements you don't have to list
them on an OP-UA form.  I've prepared the renewals with an OP-UA11 form that
makes a negative Subpart GG applicability statement.  However, if you prefer
I can remove these forms.  Having the forms in the permit makes it clear to
an inspector that the turbine is "grandfathered" from GG.  What is your
preference?

There is one mistake in my email. The BIC meeting I refer to as "December 1"
is the November 30 BIC meeting.

Subject: 12/12 BIC Mtg Proposed ICAP Documents
Importance: High


Attached in support of Agenda Item 5B , ICAP, for the December 12, 2000
Business Issues Committee meeting, and pursuant to the motion passed at the
December 1, 2000 BIC meeting, are the following documents:

1. A clean version of proposed Tariff language on Stage 1A ICAP, consisting
of all those modifications made by the ICAPWG over the course of their
deliberations in the last few months with the exception of  (1) UCAP and (2)
one month OPP; and

2. A blacklined version of that proposed Tariff, marked to show changes from
the current Tariff.

The clean version includes a table of contents for ease of review.

Please note that, pursuant to the motion passed by BIC on December 1,
substantive changes not included in the ICAPWG November 21 Proposed Tariff
(considered by BIC on December 1) must be presented on separate motion at
the December 12 meeting.  The ISO has one such change, to Section 5.12.10;
the language was circulated prior to the December 1 BIC meeting and will be
recirculated tomorrow.

Please call or write with questions or comments. Many thanks.

Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total 
car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing 
provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value 
proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first 
choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract 
reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and 
low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, 
where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or 
Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate 
selected: 
1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or 
Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for 
any damage to it. 
2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. 
For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 
per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following 
contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded 
on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)

To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's 
preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in 
National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club 
membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the 
transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid 
return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron 
travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron 
American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on 
the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact Jeff Leath at 
713-646-6165.

Subject: It costs so little and means so much

As you are probably aware, if voting results in Florida stand as they
are now, George W. Bush will be our next President.
This will have catastrophic results in our vital -- no, indispensable

entertainment industry. Barbra Streisand, Martin Sheen, Susan Sarandon,
Whoopie Goldberg, Alec Baldwin -- among many others -- have sworn to leave
the country if George W. Bush is elected President.
And this is where YOU can help.  We need volunteers to help pack and
to
load moving vans.  We also need airfare for these irreplaceable national
treasures so they can relocate before they change their minds.
For the cost of a small SUV, you can sponsor one of these celebrities
and their unfortunate relocation.
You will know that your efforts are helping when you receive
postcards,
letters and pictures from your chosen "refugee" as they learn to become a

pmorrison@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:




Dear Market Participants,

- At about 6:30PM (1830) on November 22, 2000 the Production
Mainframe was restarted at the request of the Shift Supervisor
(for time not updating on screens).

- The Mainframe-Spider Data Exchange (DEX) did not initialize
correctly at that time causing a failure to send any 5-min data
(MWs and LBMPs)  to the MIS.

- The problem was finally corrected at approximately 7:15PM (1914)
which re-established the DEX.

- We have been able to reconstruct the LBMPs that were calculated
during this problem period, as well as the PTS data.

- This data was posted and the final billing for Nov will include this data.

Regards,
Customer Relations

"Pavo, Mike" <mike.pavo@nrgenergy.com> writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE 
Discussion List:

NRG respectfully requests a written clarification of the events and
consequences of the apparent schedule deviation on Phase I/II for December
08 HE21.  The data shows a schedule of 1100mw into NE and an actual flow of
450mw, a deficiency of at least 650mw for the entire hour.

Questions:
1. Is the data correct?  If no what was the error?  If yes see below;
2. Was there an emergency energy sale to HQ for this hour to cover the
deficiency?
3. What was the impact to energy and ancillary prices?
4. What was the impact on the NERC performance criteria (CPS1 and CPS2)?
5. Is the deficiency intended to be resolved thru inadvertent energy
account?


Below is the printout of the flow and schedule.

Thanks

Mike Pavo
NRG Power Marketing

Rao,
The P&L application has a error in it.  Discrepancies are occuring on the 
location of MDEA deal information within the P&L application.  

Deals entered on the hourly tabs on the sheet labled "MDEA-SVCE" are not all 
appearing on the sheet labeled "Checkout".  Alternatively, some deals 
appearing on the "checkout" sheet are not apppearing on the hourly tabs.  
Please take a look at this and make whatever corrections are necessary.

Meeting Planning Team,
This like it is on target at this point.  You should probably circulate the
draft to Pribble, after you are comfortable with it, to get his preliminary
buy-in.  Now, I do have a few questions.  Is someone talking with the
Little America Hotel in Flagstaff and blocking out enough rooms for our
meeting?  When can we get some preliminary dates (How about the week of
April 22, 2002?)???   If that week is not good, then go to the second week
in May as I will have serious conflicts with the first week of May.  Also,
who will be in charge of planning the evening dinners?  I would like to
talk with that person as I have a couple of "fun" ideas to offer about
where we might go for dinner.  Thanks to both the North Safety Team and the
SW Environmental Team for taking a lead role in this.  John

> confirmation pages, etc.) Future portal releases

Dear Market Participants,

Please help the NYISO "clean house" so we can start our
next year of operations with an up-to-date database of
active digital certificate holders.

You may receive multiple copies of this messages - if so,
it indicates you have multiple certificates.  No action is
needed in this case.

Please notify me of persons who may have had a
certificate but have left your company, or have other
responsibilities within your company such that they no
longer need or use their certificate.

Thank you,
Pete Morrison

Can someone shed any light on how much generation was on May 1 out of
merit?  I thought all such requests, whether by the Transmission
Provider or the ISO, were to be posted on the Dispatcher Notices.  There
were no notices posted between 04:03:58 and 21:50:53.  In that time
period I had gas turbines requested on by the ISO out of merit for 7
hours.  Was this done on a larger scale or was this an isolated
incident?

NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Not to be argumentative, but we all pay for studies done by the ISO for
various purposes such as interconnect etc. The rules as I understand them is
that things get posted and provided to everyone at the same time for all of
these studies. If there is a policy or process that is outside of this
structure that's fine, but I would like to know about it, and ask the ISO to
explain how that works so others can avail themselves of the same
opportunities for ISO studies that can be provided on an "advance" basis.

In response to Roy's comments.  NYPA is paying for all the work conducted by
the ISO staff.  NYPA defined the study objective and all the ISO staff did
was conduct the MARS studies and document the results in the write-up we
provided to the tech exchange.

"Roy J. Shanker" <royjshanker@worldnet.att.net> writes to the
NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

As a separate item to the concerns I had about the technical content, I was
a little confused on what was done here administratively. The last paragraph
says something about NYPA sharing the study. I didn't think they had
anything at all to say about it in the first place if it is an ISO work
product. If they do, could you explain why this is the case? If the ISO did
this, why wasn't this all posted on the OASIS at the same time NYPA got
this? The date on this shows a March 26 release.  Ignore these comments if
this was done, but I wasn't aware of this.

I am more than a little uncomfortable with a single market participant
having a month's lead time on ISO studies that can have significant
commercial impact. Think about the implications of this in the context of
people negotiating long term bi lateral ICAP agreements over the last month.
Depending on your take on the type of market changes that this type of
analysis might support, there could be enormous changes to the economics of
seasonal versus annual agreements, choice of equipment etc. This simply
isn't fair. Even if posted, this type of work by the ISO that can have large
potential commercial impacts should go out on all of the distributions at
the same time as release to anyone and OASIS posting.

Subject: NYPA study-Winter Locational ICAP requirements

At NYPA's request ISO staff conducted a limited analysis of
the winter locational ICAP requirements for Long Island and New York City
areas.  While such ICAP requirements have historically been set as a single
number for the entire year, it is NYPA's belief that this holdover from the
old way of doing business must be re-examined.  It is NYPA's belief that
most if not all of the contribution to loss of load risk occurs in the
summer months.  As such, some reduction in winter ICAP requirements should
be possible with no impact on the Loss of Load criterion of one day in ten
years.

NYPA requested that the ISO start with the database that
resulted in the locational requirements of 80% and 98% for New York City and
Long Island, respectively.   At NYPA's request the ISO modeled winter
ratings on the transmission interfaces into NYC and LI and determined how
much the 80% and 98% could be reduced in the winter before any impact on the
statewide Loss Of Load  occurred.  The report indicates that winter
requirements of 75% and 92% of the summer peak load resulted for NYC and LI,
respectively.

While this in no way reflects an exhaustive analysis of winter
locational requirements, the results from this study suggest that some
reduction in the winter         requirement may be warranted and a
consideration of seasonal requirements should be incorporated in future ICAP
requirement studies.   NYPA believes that       having an ICAP requirement
for summer and winter seasons based on the LSE's peak load for the
respective season would send the proper ICAP price signal.


NYPA is sharing the study results in the attached report in
an effort to begin a dialog which we hope will lead to a broader examination
of locational requirements when the issue is revisited again next year.  We
would appreciate hearing the views of other market participants.

Dear George
I trust all is well. In advance of Kemm's presentation to your team on
Wednesday, I am attaching our WEFA Energy Services brochure to better
familiarize your team with the WEFA services available to you. I realize
Kemm will be focusing on Power, the brochure simply provides additional WEFA
background as a courtesy.

"Kirkpatrick, Joe" <joe.kirkpatrick@nrgenergy.com> writes to the 
NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:



Is evening load pick up a security issue or an economic issue?
Loading a Gilboa to peak shave is outside of the market rules. There are
other bids that should have been accepted prior to this control action.

27-Nov-2000 15:45:59 ISO REQUESTS GILBOA___4 OUT OF MERIT FOR ISO SECURITY.
EVENING LOAD PICK UP AT 16:00 11/27/00

If the NYISO is under generated due to load pick up why are GTs not
dispatched instead of loading generation out-of-merit.
If the NYISO is loading Gilboa to satisfy 10 min spinning reserve why are
not 10 min non-spin generators or 30 minute non-spin generators dispatched
prior to dispatching generation out-of-merit.
Both 10 minute and 30 minute non-spin generators if generated could be
generated displacing 10 spinning reserve negating the need to dispatch
Gilboa out-of-merit.
As always due to limited info available conclusions are drawn based on info
available. If more info is available please post it.

Thanks

Joe

Subject: VaR Model

Attached below is the Excel-based VaR Calculator that allows VaR calculations 
for up to 5 different curves and/or products. The results may be different 
that those generated in the "official" VaR model, because it does not reflect 
all the intricacies. We have developed an Ad-hoc VaR model that allows quick 
calculations of VaR for a potential transaction, as well as the incremental 
VaR on a given portfolio (using the "official" VaR model). We will make this 
tool available to you via http://rac.enron.com/ in the near future (pending 
IT implementation).



TJ,

I do not have a list of names of all the traders on the desk (individuals who 
attended the VaR presentation). Could you please forward this e-mail to them.

Feel free to call me with any questions. Vlady.

As discussed at the recent DES meeting, whenever you need the RO's signature, 
please use the attached form filled out as appropriate.  I need to review 
permit applications and permit renewals only.  I do not need to review annual 
compliance certifications, semiannual monitoring reports, emission test 
results and any other air related documents prior to getting the RO's 
signature.  (Make sure you remove my approval from the form for these 
documents.)  I would like a copy of these documents (electronic or paper) 
however.

Ruth

Dear Market Participants,

Please disregard any messages sent from the NYISO to ICAP buyers
today; there is a problem with our automatic e-mail system.  We
anticipate that the problem will be fixed shortly and messages
sent tomorrow concerning the ICAP auction will be correct.

The ISO (K Robb) circulated the ISO's position on the Def Penalties this
PM. It is attached.

As it stands, what the ISO wants now (or previously wanted) is an issue to
be decided by the BIC. What is now proposed - empowering the ISO to change
the deficiency rates if an adjacent ISO modifies (presumably upward) their
caps - has one large problem: if such an action were taken in the midst of
a Capability Period it would cause all sorts of issues with participant
positions.

Having said that I offer the following:

The FERC staff report strongly indicated that caps would have to exist (if
at all) on a regional basis and at similar levels.

In order to de-list and be free to sell out, a generator must make that
decision for the following month by the 10th of the current month. That is
trading a sure ICAP revenue stream for the increased opportunity to sell
energy at higher prices - even if some disaster befell one of out
neighbors, the amount that can move is limited by the transmission
capability.

What is the likelihood that any of the 3 NE ISOs will be uncapped next
Summer?

The transmission system limits how much energy can flow regardless of price
considerations. NY-NE about 1500Mw and NY-PJM about 2000 Mw (pending return

BME, if faced with a reserve shortage (or inability to meet load), will
curtail exports to solve that problem.

       Period

The following message has been forwarded to the Tech Exchange at the
request of
Steven Keller of the NY PSC:


Statement of the Department of Public Service Staff to the BIC
Regarding Shortening the ICAP Obligation Procurement Period from Six
Months to One Month


The ICAP Working Group has proposed Phase II tariff language that
implements the BIC/MC decisions to implement a monthly ICAP obligation
procurement period (OPP) instead of the current six-month OPP.  It is our
understanding that this proposal is largely supported by incumbent load
serving entities who are currently required to purchase their ICAP six
month's in advance even though they expect to lose load to new entrants
during that period.  The LSE's are concerned that they may lose money
trying to sell unneeded ICAP back into the market.  Staff of the New York
State Department of Public Service (Staff) understands those concerns.

A report by the Brattle Group suggests that the existence of price caps in
New York could lead to capacity migration from New York under a one-month
OPP scenario.  Brattle suggests that under such a system certain
"optimistic" suppliers might choose not to offer to sell their ICAP to NY
if they think they could do better by selling energy into external markets
where they could earn high revenues in high demand month.   If that
happens, even to a limited extent, we believe it will likely result in
increased purchase costs for ICAP purchased both on a bilateral basis and
through the ISO auctions, and could also push up energy prices.

In a subsequent study by KEMA it is suggested that in order to avoid
capacity migration ICAP deficiency charges should be increased as much as
six-fold.  The obvious result would be that all LSE's would be exposed to
significantly higher deficiency charges under a
one-month OPP.  Staff does not view this as an acceptable alternative to
retaining a six-month OPP even with its potential that LSEs may incur a
loss as a result of purchasing ICAP for load they expect to lose.

As of November 29, 2000, the ISO has been unable to estimate the level of
deficiency penalties that would be required to avoid capacity migration
under a one-month OPP.  As a result, the New York State Department of
Public Service has been unable to verify whether the current levels need
to be increased, decreased or left as they are.  Because of concerns about
capacity migration, and because there is very little convincing argument
about the costs/benefits that would result from moving to a one-month ICAP
OPP that cannot at least partially be obtained from the six month OPP with
monthly deficiency auctions, Staff is opposed to such a change at this
time.   Until the ISO and market participants work out how to ensure that
energy and ICAP markets will remain workably competitive even during peak
periods, we believe it is prudent to move cautiously with regard to
shortening the OPP.

Chad.J.Wagner@dynegy.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:


This raises concerns about what functions any ISO should take on in the
long run.  Here the ISO used its limited resources, ones which many members
want directed to specific high priority projects... such as virtual
bidding, to perform a study on ICAP that we did not know about until a
flurry of emails arrive.  The point is, the ISO better serves by focusing
its talent and limited time on facilitating the operation of a workable,
reliable, cost effective and efficient power market and by performing
studies consistent with member priorities.  Not by performing studies at
the request of one member, unless they are part of a clearly defined and
approved process like that for interconnections.  The ISO should work as a
"market facilitator," and as such expend its talents on providing accurate
and timely pricing, billing, and tracking of energy transactions within,
into, and out of New York.

The NYISO's need to periodically address market reliability issues and to
initiate studies should continue, in the near term.   Market participants
can raise concerns about reliability issues or submit studies they perform
to the ISO and if the ISO believes that they have merit, we can all review
and debate them and not be advantaged or disadvantaged by some activities
that the ISO decided to undertake with one member.  The ISO should not
pirate market participants' opportunities to analyze the dynamics of
generation availability, transmission, ICAP, and demand to discover areas
for investment.

What better stimulus than ROI is there to seek out opportunities and
eradicate inefficiencies in the market?  Let the market work, and the ISO
facilitate.

Gentlemen:
?
We look forward to getting your Nov. 10 hourly  deals. If you would, please 
set up an email list with:

bobette.riner@ipgdirect.com
ellen.clardy@ipgdirect.com??  Phone # is 713/647-6603
suzanna.strangmeier.@ipgdirect.com?  Phone # is 713/647-7325
tradersnewsindexes@ipgdirect.com?  (The latter is our shared, group email  
address.)
?
Thanks so much for your cooperation and rest  assured, we're endeavoring to 
get the Cin index out by 9:15 a.m. each weekday.  Is that the optimum time, 
getting the index out after options  expire?
?
This will take some time, getting people to  cooperate, but we will prevail.
?
Also, please note we're collecting historicals for  ComEd, TVA and SPP, if 
you want to include those deals (no indicative necessary  at this time).
?
Thanks, guys! As always, call if we can be of  assistance--

NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Don,

There is no question you are right - this can happen.  You also know in
trading there is no transaction without risk (especially in NY).  Do you
trust the ISO and their software to effectively implement a whole new
settlement?  You may also be aware of some of the gaming opportunities that
arose when they looked into implementing the BME settlement.  The proposed
solution seems to eliminate most of the gaming, and yes, shifts more risk
over to the market participant.  Sometimes we have to take the bad with the
fair.  The 20k adder didn't fix anything - it only gave DAM transactions a
higher priority - if you want that security it is still open to you.  All
this does is give you the option to have the ISO evaluate your transaction
again the real-time . . . like any option, you don't have to exercise it.


Good luck,

Ray

Dear Mr. LARRY CAMPBELL:

The equity in your Datek Online trading account has fallen below our
margin maintenance requirements.  This results in a 'margin
maintenance call' that requires you to either make an immediate
payment or to close out some of your portfolio.  If your account
is not restored to its required equity by three business days from today,
portions of your portfolio may be liquidated.  Furthermore,
Datek Online reserves the right to take action at ANY time
with or without notice if market conditions warrant.

Your current margin call is as follows:

Userid =CAMPB54792
$1836.61

When funding your account, we strongly recommend that you send any payments by
overnight delivery.  Otherwise, your deposit may not be received in time to 
satisfy
this call.  Please make checks payable to Datek Online and please include your
username or account number on the face of your check before mailing to...

iClearing LLC
Attn: Margin Dept.
100 Wood Avenue South
Iselin, NJ 08830-2716

Thank you.

barkerde@nmenergy.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:



After going through the Representative, Hot Line, and finally turning to the 
TIE
(yes , last resort). I have all my questions and concerns addressed. MP's 
using
the forum helped tremendously. However the written and phone discussions with 
a
NYISO staff person who took a lot of time and patience helped me understand,
while not the ideal solution, the combination of bid guarantees, bid baby
sitting, ECA's, and a healthy dose of caution , the resulting procedures are 
the
best that can be crafted at this time. Because of all the resultant phone 
calls
that will be generated from those who want to know more details on how to work
their bids, I have definitely decided NOT to disclose that Bob Thompson was 
the
one who helped me. I don't want  Bob Thompson's workload increase if it got 
out.
So that is why I won't mention Bob Thompson's name in conjunction with this
subject....And that's final! Thanks Bob.

consists of two items, both of which involve MR 17: (1) Transmission
Congestion Compensation and (2) Structural Screen for OP-4 (bid cap) type of
conditions.

Attached is a file containing two exhibits that provide congestion
information that, hopefully, will aid in the group's discussion on the first

a conference call.  The dial-in number is as follows:

Telephone Number:  (212) 293-3100
Passcode:  7837367

Thank you.

Don.

Also, attached is the directions to the ISO which show where the Holyoke
Holiday Inn is located.  As you get off 91 North you will see it on your
left just past the gas station at the corner of Whiting Farms Road and Lower
Holyoke Road.  To your right is Holyoke Mall.  If you should have any
questions, please give Susan Dumond a call at (413) 535-4097.

We are pleased to present you with a 2001 Special Stock Option Grant Award.
As a participant in this grant you have the opportunity to share in the
ownership of Enron and the potential profit from increases in the value of
Enron's common stock.

The 2001 Special Stock Option Grant was made to let you know how valuable
you are and to recognize your contributions in making Enron the great
company it is today.   Although there are no guarantees as to Enron's
future stock performance, we believe that an Enron stock option has
tremendous future growth potential.  The value you ultimately receive from
your options will depend on the price of Enron stock at the time you
exercise your options.

You can access your 2001 Special Stock Option Grant Agreement and the Stock
Plan document governing the grant via your eHRonline account on the
intranet website at http://ehronline.enron.com.  Unlike stock options
granted in the past a copy of your grant agreement will not be mailed to
your home address.

Additionally, the following information regarding the 2001 Special Stock
Option Grant can be found on the HR website http://hrweb.enron.com.

Aaron Breidenbaugh <aaron@global2000.net> writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE 
Discussion List:

Greetings,

I was surprised today to learn that MSWG is recommending a delay in the
implementation of zonal price capped load bidding until the fall, when
it can be implemented simultaneously with virtual bidding.

The priority assigned to zonal PCLB is a settled issue and one that is
not properly before the MSWG or BIC at this time. The NYISO Management
and Board have already determined that implementation of zonal PCLB by
May is one of the ISO's highest priorities. Implementation of zonal PCLB
by this summer is even part of the NYISO Business Plan, Goal and
Objectives, and Incentive Compensation plan. In addition, the project
prioritization process adopted by the Management Committee has ratified
the priority assigned to this critical effort.

Apart from sporadic concerns raised by a few generators, there has never
been any indication that zonal PCLB should be delayed until virtual
bidding can be implemented. Indeed, it appears that the decision by the
MSWG to advance this proposal was decided upon at the last meeting of
the Virtual Bidding Task Force which does not even have official
standing as a NYISO subcommittee. That meeting's material did not in any
way indicate that such a major change was being contemplated, let alone
that it would be a recommendation to the BIC less than a week later.

The Price Responsive Load Coalition strongly supports the ISO's previous
decisions to implement zonal PCLB by this summer and views it as a
critical component of the state's efforts to engage loads' participation
in the market in a meaningful way. We will oppose any efforts to delay
implementation simply because some generators raise speculative fears of
"manipulation" of the markets by loads.

While there may well be merit to implementing zonal PCLB and virtual
bidding simultaneously, the proposal now before us threatens to throw
the baby out with the bathwater, depriving customers of one of their
only means of ameliorating the effects of markets that may not be
workably competitive.

>From both a procedural and substantive perspective, the proposal
presented to the BIC is fundamentally defective and must be rejected.

Sincerely,
Aaron Breidenbaugh
Executive Director

Subject: FERC Staff Investigations on Midwest and Southeast Bulk Power Systems


On 11/1/00, FERC Staff issued reports on its Investigation of Bulk Power 
Markets in the Eastern Interconnection.  These reports were the result of a 
Commission order earlier this summer.  Enron's Federal regulatory staff 
(Christi, Charles Yeung, and Sarah Novosel) provided a great deal of 
information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discussed 
many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff, Scott Miller 
(who recently joined FERC from PG&E Gen).    While the Commission is under no 
obligation to take any of Staff's recommendations, the Commission typically 
looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues.  Importantly, 
Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the 
Southeast and Midwest -- all of which Enron has been asking FERC to implement 
for several years:

Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by 
requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other 
transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to 
favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of 
interconnection requests.

While the Staff Hotline is used productively, the Commission can direct Staff 
to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of 
complaints.

The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a pro 
forma interconnection process specific to interconnection, rather than simply 
relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and 
procedures.

Require TPs to retain real-time transmission data on market functions 
pertaining to daily load, internal generation to meet that load, and imports 
and exports.

RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC, as well 
as standardized criteria for curtailment.  In addition, since even such 
standardized criteria might not "get to the root of the problem" -- that 
control area still control generation -- the Commission could require that 
each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area.  
Regardless of the implementation of these two options, the Commission could 
standardize ATC and TTC methodology.

Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics 
similar to many other commodities, it is still viewed as "different," with a 
reaction of price caps.  Staff encourages that basic decisions about the 
regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a 
traditional cost-of-service model to a model that uses markets to price the 
commodity and services.  

DETAILS  (Also, the reports contain good summaries of the generation, 
transmission, state retail, federal reg. and other issues for the region):

Midwest:  The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission 
Providers ("TPs") that control transmission, generation and load.  "As such, 
they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission service 
to third-parties and strong incentives to favor their own services."  Staff 
received numerous complaints; however, due to the lack of information 
available from TPs, Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated 
incidents or wide-spread.  At the very least, the complaints indicate a lack 
of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participants 
to rely on transmission access, thus harming the liquidity of the market.  

TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest, with an 
"enormous" increase in 2000.  The region showed a decline in peak load from 
1999 to 2000 and a growth in new generation since the 1998 price spikes.  
Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with 
virtually no price spikes, TLRs climbed to record numbers.  The TLRs were 
highly concentrated:  only 5 flowgates account for 41% of ECAR TLRs and 
another 5 flowgates in MAIN account for 42% in that region.  Notably, even 
though the NERC procedures for Level 3 TLRs mandate transaction curtailment, 
78 of the 191 TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount.  The 
total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are 
not posted.  Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC, whose 
procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties.  While the Commission 
has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open 
Access Transmission Tariffs ("OATT") where the Commission has the power to 
enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act, in practice the Commission 
has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions, 
including the propriety of TLRs.

TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market 
because load is not served by the least cost supplier.  TLR procedure is an 
inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints -- curtailment by fiat.  In 
addition, the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased 
loading on the affected flowgate.  The impact could be mitigated by one 
control area per RTO.

Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for 
price caps following the 1998 price spikes.  Some market participants believe 
that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction 
increased in the Midwest.  

Market participants must keep track of, and follow, a plethora of information 
in order to make energy deals, submit reservations and provide schedules for 
service.  Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission 
access, including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information and 
protocols, particularly for ATC and interconnection requests, and 
discriminatory conduct.  Unbelievably, key data was unavailable to Staff, 
such coincident peak load data, system-wide snap shots for days when TLRs 
were called, and import/export data.  This lack of data creates a market 
inefficiency, because neither market participants nor regulators can fully 
analyze market conditions in real time.  As such, the market is risk adverse, 
eschewing long-term deals for short-term transactions.  Staff also noted that 
because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU, there is a mixed 
incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the 
IOU.  (Staff cites Richard Tabors' paper, "Transmission Markets, Stretching 
the Rules for Fun and Profit.")

Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site, 
particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments.  Examples were provided 
to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improper 
implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss.

The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems; however, all 
three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and 
native load.  These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO 
exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security 
coordinator functions.  Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region 
of 61 control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM.  The 
result is that ATCs can be different on 2 different sides of an interface.  
Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staff's own ATC audit 
this summer was consistent with market participant complaints.  Staff is 
weighing follow-up options.  The result of these problems is a lack of 
liquidity.

Staff next noted the problems with unfiled "business practices," especially 
on the next hour market.  Staff's audit of OASIS sites revealed several areas 
of non-compliance.  

Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently, 
with equal and timely access to data, including ATC, CBM, TRM, and load flow 
input data.  TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information 
transparent because of native load.  This incentive will still exist under 
RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC.  ***  "As a 
consequence, the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption 
and have all transactions under the same tariff."  ***  The Commission could 
benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require the 
TPs to retain data, including current real-time network status.

Interconnection Issues:  IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support.  Also, 
Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits 
or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely.  One solution is to have 
the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities have 
against IPPs.  The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide 
variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the 
region.

Network service has inherent advantages over point-to-point, citing the 
Entergy source and sink order.  The Commission has relied on "passively" 
receiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory 
behavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants.  
While Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread, 
there is evidence of discriminatory instances.


Southeast:  The traditional vertically integrated utility ("VIU") model has 
largely persisted in the SE.  This continued control has vastly reduced the 
economic incentives to facilitate IPP activities.  In many cases, the VIUs 
have dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation due 
to the inherent flexibility of the current rules.

Staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies, 
transmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and 
manipulation of ATC.  TPs have shown little inclination to improve the 
transmission system and use many TLRs.

There is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development 
of markets in the SE.  ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and 
there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices.

TVA, despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets, has acted 
as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the 
SE.  This is significant because of TVA's size and location.  IPPs have 
reported TVA's discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to 
perform studies, excessive fees, and rejection of requests to perform 
interconnection studies.

In addition, Staff cites the Florida Sup. Ct. decision against merchant 
plants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida.

Staff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE this 
summer.  Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power, than 
the use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices.  Peak prices were 
radically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better 
prepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts, increased 
generation capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages.  

SE utilities reported that they have not used market-based rates to 
extensively increase sales.  (Less used than in the midwest.)

The SE region lacks information, which has retarded the Staff's efforts to 
discern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the SE 
(including ATC and TLRs).  Market participants seem to have less confidence 
in the SE market than in any other market region.  This appears to be 
justified based on Staff's investigations.  This lack of confidence 
discourages investment and participation in the markets.  Staff concludes 
that the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how 
transmission is allocated in the SE RTOs, since there are market concerns 
that the incumbents will continue to dominate operations.  The investigation 
found numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings.  In 
addition, several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data.  Staff 
thinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted.  
Staff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commission's lack of 
jurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access 
information.

The Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lack 
of adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits.  In 
addition, the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission 
capacity, much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to 
interconnect.  Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied 
Skygen's request for transmission stating that the only option was the 
construction of an 80 mile 500 kv line that would take 8 years to complete.  
Staff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting 
self-build capacity in the incumbent's territory.

ATC variations are a big problem in the SE.  SERC coordination of a 
standardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without 
direction from the Commission.  An improved method and improved communication 
are needed.

The SE experienced a 354% increase in TLRs this summer.  This increase raises 
the issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitive 
operation of the market in the SE.  Staff cites information provided by 
Charles Y. that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC 
criteria.  Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs do 
not generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented.  RTOs 
must have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints.  In 
addition, RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs.  
However, if control areas are retained, VIUs will retain mixed incentives.

*** As noted in the Midwest report, the manner in which load is calculated 
weighs heavily on the value of this information.  This is an issue that the 
formation of RTOs may not resolve.  Eliminating native load exceptions -- ie, 
treating all load equally -- and placing all transactions under the same 
tariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provision 
of transparent and standardized information.

Finally, Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FP&L, TVA is a 
"problem area" for the Eastern Interconnect grid.  TVA is a transmission 
bottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer.  The current federal law 
and lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of 
deep and robust power markets in this area.  TVA simply has no strong 
incentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service.  In 
addition, the Commission does not have full information on TVA.  Staff lists 
a number of complaints against TVA, including unjustifiably increasing the 
tag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing, but not others, to sink and park 
power.  Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the 
development of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential.

A Staff audit of FP&L revealed violations of standards of conduct, including 
confidential information on FP&L's transmission system (including interchange 
information for other entities) posted on EMS systems that were available to 
FPL's merchant function.  Staff's report found that FP&L does not have an 
established procedure for review of EMS to ensure that information is not 
displayed in error.  It is "up to individual Managers discretion."  ((FRCC 
web site report dated 9/8/00)).  Violations such as these undermine 
competition.

I won't repeat everything that Mark said. I agree with all of it. I
publically stated several times that it would be appropriate for parties to
consider these plus other risk elements in formulating bidding strategies
for upcoming ICAP.

However, it also appears that Steven has forgotten a major and fundamental
change in the ICAP markets. This is surprising as he characterizes ICAP as a
call on the resource. When ICAP was offered for last summer there was no
energy price cap, or effectively the price cap was $10,000, today it is
$1,000. This means that in the context of his analogy a call was offered
last summer with a strike price of $10,000 versus $1,000 today. An order of
magnitude change in strike price for the seller of a call seems pretty major
to me, particularly when coupled with all of the other new risk factors and
general "tightening" of supply versus demand.

"Stephen Fernands" <srfernands@cesolution.com> writes to the
NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Mark,
Thank you for your thoughtful response.  I think you raise some valid
points, but I do not think they change the end conclusion.

Fundamental Value of ICAP
The principle of the ICAP market, as in any market, should be to reflect the
value of the underlying product that is being sold to the market.  The
question is whether the product being sold, in this case ICAP, has truly
appreciated more then 400% since the previous ICAP auctions.  Maybe - but I
doubt it.

AMP and Expected Revenue
The premise that changing the existing market mitigation rules to catch rule
breaking on a real time basis instead of a one day lag basis, although
plausible, seems fairly weak.  It presumes that generation owners were
planning on violating the pre-existing screens and counting on the revenue
from those "golden eggs."  Likewise, the link between "expected energy
revenue" and ICAP prices is tenuous at best.  Generators are not limited to
receiving revenue from the spot market and may well choose to sell energy in
the bilateral market.  In either case the goal of the generation owner is to
maximize revenue through all markets.  The ICAP market, if functioning
properly, should reflect the value of the first call on the energy from the
generator by the NYISO and the ability of the NYISO to curtail external
transactions from that generator.  For example two generation owners owned
two plants with the same characteristics. One generation owner did a
relatively "good" job selling a forward energy contract for the 6 month
procurement period while the other owner did a relatively "poor" job selling
a similar contract.  In the ICAP auctions they both should have the same
strategy - maximize the revenue that each of them can receive out of the
ICAP auction.  Any other strategy by either of the plants will lead to
overall lower profits.

Price Cap Load Bidding (I won't comment on if Virtual Bidding were in place
because it isn't going to be)
Price Cap Load Bidding has been available in the past, only know it is
expanded slightly to Zonal Price Cap Load Bidding.  This is not a
significant change to the existing rules and would seem unlikely to account
for either a significant change in the expected energy revenue or the
underlying value of the ICAP product.

"...significant uncertainty to the New York market..."
I would agree that all of the rule changes including the Penalty and Public
Disclosure Proposal  made it difficult for generation owners to properly
evaluate the effects of selling ICAP into a 6 month market.  For this
reason, as well as the other possible reasons listed on my letter, I believe
that mitigating measures should be evaluated.  I am not passing judgment at
this stage, but feel that all parties should know that the prices that were
posted are in the process of being reviewed and that subsequent changes may
be required to some or all of the months.

Next Steps
If the MMU determines that there was economic and/ or physical withholding,
whether due to regulatory uncertainty in surrounding control areas or
internal uncertainty about the exact effects of the AMP, I believe that it
is most appropriate for the MMU to take immediate action and refer it to the
committees for longer term resolution.

At or before the May 16th meeting in Hicksville, there is some basic
information that is needed for marketers to determine their regulatory risk
in accepting capacity from KeySpan East and West. KeySpan must provide , in
detail, for all transportation contracts (East and West) the following
information:

 - Max. Daily Quantity
 - Telescoping (Receipt and Delivery Points/ Amounts available at
different delivery points)
 - Rate Schedules
 - Pipeline
 - Start Date
 - End Date
 - Current Rates (Demand, Variable, Fuel %, Surcharges)
 - Any proposed pipeline rate changes that take effect in the next
year (effective Date)
 - Map the gas flow of contracts, if transportation feeds into other
transportation contracts.
 - Identify contracts used for storage W/D or Inj.
 - Identify historical (past 24 months) geographic basis differential
to the NYMEX for each receipt point on the different transportation
contracts

KeySpan should explain the contractual and operational restrictions for not
releasing a slice of the system. The percentage of secondary delivery
capacity needs to be defined and KeySpan should inform marketers of any
preliminary negations for incremental purchases and the pricing terms to
serve the firm market.

The ICAP Deficiency auction results indicate a price for the Rest Of State
that I believe is equal to the ICAP deficiency price.  Likewise, the Long
Island price appears to be the deficiency price.  How much capacity
requirement in each region was unmet by the deficiency auction?

marketrelations@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Dear Market Participants

Many Market Participants recognized the mismatch in prices which were posted 
on
the NYISO website versus those which were used for billing in the settlement
statements.

The NYISO has identified the various differences and has modified software
necessary to update and / or correct the prices associated with the categories
listed below;

Upon completion of all the Historical LBMP updates noted below, the NYISO will
recompute and post new real time weighted files.  Information on what 
intervals
have been changed, as a result of a specific issue noted below, will be
provided.

Issue #1:  Prices and Postings During Reserve Pickup Intervals:
During instances where the dispatch interval is in response to a  Reserve 
Pickup
request, the price which will be used to bill a Reserve Pickup (RPU)  period 
is
the price associated with the most recent normal SCD execution interval
preceding the reserve pickup interval. There were limited instances during the
first 11 months of operation where an LBMP was incorrectly calculated and 
posted
for the reserve pickup intervals.

Solution Issue #1:  For the period 11/99 until the present, all RPU intervals
that were inadvertently posted with price calculations based on the reserve
pickup intervals will be replaced with the price from the dispatch cycle
immediately preceding the reserve pickup.  Any modifications made which result
in changes to the billing data will be corrected through the re-bill and 
true-up
process in future months.


Issue #2:  Posted Price Discrepancies Between Proxy Bus and Load Bus Prices:
During the process of correcting and reposting prices, the Generator or proxy
bus prices were updated, but not the Zonal or load prices.

Solution Issue #2: ALL proxy gen prices which are different from their
corresponding zonal prices, will be copied into the zonal bus prices to
overwrite any possible discrepancies between these two files, as these should 
be
identical. NOTE: The Billing & Accounting System (BAS) was coded to use the
generator proxy bus price.  Therefore the BAS calculations have been 
consistent
with the generator proxy price and should not affect any bills.


Issue #3:  Missing SCD Intervals In Pass of Data Between SCD and PTS- Due to
Loss of Communications:
At times there periods exist when communication links between operating 
systems,
namely SCD and Performance Tracking (PTS) in this case, have failed and have 
to
be manually reactivated.  During these sub-system failure periods, SCD 
intervals
are being saved and when communications are restored or through the price
correction process the SCD intervals are restored.  During these failure 
periods
the SCD Start/Stop signals are not being transferred to the PTS. Six-second
actual data continues to be received by PTS during these failure periods.  PTS
develops an average actual value over the SCD interval periods. During the
failure periods the PTS observations do not match the number of SCD interval
observations. The BAS is coded to ignore any intervals where there is not a
match between the price file and the metered MW files. For example, if SCD had
intervals for :05, :10 and :15 and the PTS integrated actuals covered the 
period
:05 - :15 then the BAS would calculate the billing based on the consistent 
sets
of data, The interval then becomes a 10 minute interval.

Solution Issue #3 The system will be programmed such that it will recognize 
when
an interval is missing in PTS and the PTS interval will be generated by
splitting the large interval,  with the assumption that the energy was 
delivered
uniformly over the entire interval.   Retroactive to Nov'99, the missing
intervals will be created.  Through the monthly rebill and true-up process,
these intervals will be used and billing results may change as a result.

Issue #4:  Dispatch Interval Type "R"
When SCD is in a reserve pickup, and the pick-up is unsuccessful after 10
minutes, an extra PTS interval is generated for performance tracking of units.
This interval is not an actual interval where basepoints are calculated and 
sent
to generators.  At the time the PTS intervals are sent to the MIS, an LBMP
interval is also sent.    These intervals were posted on the OASIS and then
ignored in BAS.

Solution Issue #4 Retroactively to Nov'99, all LBMP intervals generated as 
part
of the reserve pickup performance tracking process will be deleted.  In the
future, the intervals will not be sent to MIS for posting.

Issue #5:  Consistent Updated Price Postings
Prior to January 2000, intervals updated as part of price corrections were
posted to a different spot on the OASIS in a different format,  thus making it
difficult for market participants to locate the correct data.

Solution Issue #5 Retroactively to Nov'99, an update of the current LBMP 
posting
files will be accomplished to include the price corrections not originally
posted.


The intent of the NYISO is to have all corrections for retroactive price 
posting
discrepancies, and software enhancements completed by the end of Nov 2000.

To Market Participants

The official change from the 'Old' website to the 'New'
website will occur at 10:00 AM May 8.  We expect the
change to take about 10 minutes to complete.  The change
will only affect the public portion of the website and should
be transparent to most users.

If you are on the public website at the time of the switch, you
may need to reload/refresh the page you are viewing.  Also,
if you are downloading public data directly or through a script file,
errors may occur.  Simply reinitialize the download to correct
any errors that may have occurred.

If after about 10:10, 10:15 AM you are still experiencing difficulties,
please contact your Customer Relations Representative
or call 1-518-356-6060.

Thank You
The Website Refresh Team

On April 24, 2001, the NYISO deployed code changes affecting Class 1 PURPA
transactions in the billing system and modified bid status flagging in the
MIS.  These changes impacted settlements for 4/10, 4/11, 4/13, and 4/18 -
forward.

There was a code design problem with the PURPA code change that resulted in
an error in the computation of balancing energy for some class 1 units that
resulted in their purchasing their entire day-ahead schedules in the
balancing market.  There was also an oversight in the implementation of the
modified bid status flagging in the MIS such that those bids were not
transferred into the billing system, impacting bid production cost
guarantee settlements for the units with a modified bid status.

The NYISO will be posting supplemental invoices for April 2001 settlements
by 2300, today, Tuesday, May 15th to adjust for the aforementioned issues.
Funds due the NYISO for this supplemental invoice should be transferred
into the NYISO Clearing Account by close of business Wednesday, May 23,
2001.  Funds due Market Participants from the NYISO for this supplemental
invoice will be transferred into Market Participant accounts by close of
business Friday, May 25, 2001.

PLEASE NOTE THAT: Funds due the NYISO for the April 2001 settlements which
were invoiced on May 7, 2001 should be transferred into the NYISO Clearing
Account by close of business Wednesday, May 16, 2001, as scheduled.  Funds
due Market Participants from the NYISO for the April 2001 settlements
invoiced on May 7, 2001 will be transferred into Market Participant
accounts by close of business Monday, May 21, 2001, as scheduled.

Please be aware that as per the ISO Services Tariff any disputed amounts
are to be paid in full.  Upon resolution of the dispute, if it is
determined that an overpayment has been made by the Customer, a refund,
with interest, will be made by the ISO


In order to reconcile customer invoices for the supplemental April 2001
invoice, it will be necessary to net the following versions of the daily

The EDRP and DADRP manuals will be voted on at Thursday's BIC.  We will
start with the manuals as sent out by Kristen Kranz at 5:37 on 5/21.  If we
want to make changes, we will do so through the formal amendment process at
the BIC.  If anyone has changes that rise to that level, please let the rest
of us know very soon so we can review and coordinate possible amendments.
Thanks.

Some feed back so far...... There appears to be a problem brewing with the
planned implementation of the May 29 adjustment that removes the $20K bias 
from
the DAM external transactions.I am awaiting a call back on my concerns from 
the
NYISO. By occasionally settling hourly prices through BME or occasionally
settling after SCD sets RT prices, depending on the extistence or non 
existence
of congestion, a problem that we thought we fixed many months ago will 
reappear
with the removal of the $20K bias.Here is an example of my musings....

DAM bid gets accepted at  $50 ( Import from PJM)  .....  BME  then runs (No
constraints)  evaluating the import HAM bids and other items that have
BMEprovide a $40 price.... DAM gets cut  , looks like  a $10 profit  ( 
providing
your loss in PJM doesn't exceed $10) . Due to in hour operations the RT price
clears at $60. You loooooooose!!  Sound familiar? After getting beat up like
this the MP's went through the committee structure and had the $20,000 adder
used for DAM (except IS+) to protect against this. The clearing at BME for all
external  proxy busses removed the problem so the $20,000 adder was removed. 
Now
the external interfaces only clear at BME if they are constrained. Are we 
taking
a huge step back on purpose or was there a mistake in implementation?

Chad,

To answer your question - bid cost guarantees should be entered by you, Larry 
or Narsimha as soon as you calculate them.  I will watch them periodically 
throughout the month to be sure you are calculating them correctly.  Any time 
you have a question about what NY is showing just ask.

Here is the reconciliation for April to date.  Could you please take a look 
at your calculations for 4/5, 4/6, 4/10, 4/15 & 4/16 - the variances are 
quite large.
If you want details just ask. 

Thanks,

Rebecca

NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

There are still no answers to the questions (below).

In addition to this I am curious that when the NYISO requests generation for
ISO security it is only Transmission Owner generation that is dispatched,
undoubtedly avoiding merchant generation from being dispatched. I was
wondering where the tariff language is to justify this type of out-of-merit
generation dispatch.

What deficiencies are there in the SCD software that it cannot handle load
pickups?
What is an NYISO SCD reserve pickup, and how does it affect generation from
setting clearing prices?

Why do these questions go unanswered, if there is tariff language to support
this please point me in the right direction.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------

I have a question or two with regard to the following "Operational
Announcements" (Below). These are a few examples of many that are requests
for generation being requested out-of-merit by the NYISO for NYISO security.

In my limited understanding of the way SCD works I had thought that the only
reason the ISO or a Transmission Owner would request generation out-of-merit
is to resolve for a constraint or system condition that SCD could not (set
me straight if I am off-base).
Requesting generation out-of-merit to resolve for system security is an
effective method of quickly resolving for an out-of-scope SCD system problem
and by definition will not set clearing price.

1. What are the rules and procedures in place to request generation
out-of-merit both for local (Transmission Owner) and ISO request.
2. What other control actions have to be exhausted prior to initiating a
request for generation to be called on out-of-merit.
3. Are the generation bids available to the requestor(s) prior to making the
request. (Is economics a consideration?)
4. When load is available to be dispatched, will it be considered as a
control action instead of generation?
5. Is generation called on out-of-merit to resolve for DNI constraints.
6. In particular for Gilboa it was my understanding that prior to requesting
additional generation from Gilboa that an emergency was to take place. Is
there another agreement in place between the NYISO and NYPA. Below is an
excerpt from the ICAP manual.

4.4.2 Energy Limited Resources

Energy Limited Resources that are ICAP suppliers must be able to provide the
Energy equivalent of their claimed ICAP for four (4) hours each day. Energy
Limited Resources must bid or schedule in the Day-Ahead Market for
twenty-four (24) hours each day in such a way as to enable the NYISO to
schedule them for the period in which they are capable of providing the
energy.
An Energy Limited Resource must also provide the NYISO with information
concerning the hours during which it will be recharging or replacing
depleted
resources. Once the resource has provided four hours of Energy equivalent
ICAP, the NYISO will not call on an Energy Limited Resource during its
recharge
hours, except in the case of an emergency.

Dear Market Participants,

With regard to the change shown below:
FERC ruled that the implementation of Locational Reserve Pricing must be
delayed for a period of 5 months.
The literal interpretation of that would indicate a April 8th deployment.
I can't say for sure that we have committed to that date specifically, but I 
can
say it won't take place before then.
The specifications of the eventual change may look quite different in 5 months
time.

MEMO


Date:          December 8, 2000

From:          William J. Museler, President & Chief Executive Officer

To:       Steven J. Balser, Manager of Market Monitoring and Performance
James H. Savitt, Market Monitor

Re:       Extraordinary Corrective Action to Address a Market Design Flaw:
External Proxy Bus Prices During Transmission Constraints
(ECA 20001208B; re-issuance of ECA 20001006B)


Thank  you  for  the  presentation of the Market Monitoring and Performance
Unit  and  the Market Advisor regarding the progress that has been made with 
the
Market Participants in addressing the market design flaw in the Real-Time 
energy
markets  concerning  external  proxy  bus  prices during transmission 
limitation
periods.  I am pleased that the Business Issues Committee gave unanimous 
support
to  the  NYISO  to  re-issue  ECA  20001006B  until  the Market Participants 
can
consider  and  approve, and the NYISO can implement, a tariff change required 
to
permanently address the Market Design Flaw.

As  stated  in  my Memorandum to you of October 6, 2000, I agreed with your
conclusion that the conduct identified at that time constituted a 

?Market Design
Flaw?  as  defined  in  Attachment  Q  to  the ISO OATT, Temporary 
Extraordinary
Procedures  for  Correcting  Market  Design  Flaws  and  Addressing 
Transitional
Abnormalities (the ?TEPs?).  As further stated in that Memorandum, I agreed 
with
your  analysis that prices produced by exploiting this Market Design Flaw 
would,
absent  appropriate  action,  remain  different  from what would otherwise 
occur
during periods of efficient competition.

I  have  now  determined,  based  on  consultations  with ISO Staff and the
support  of the Business Issues Committee, that it is appropriate to maintain 
in
effect  the  corrective measures adopted as ECA 20001006B while consultation 
and
cooperation with the Market Participants and jurisdictional agencies is 
on-going
to  develop  and  implement appropriate rules or rule changes in accordance 
with
the ISO Agreement.

Please re-issue the text of the Extraordinary Corrective Action (?ECA?) and
post  it  on  the  OASIS,  for implementation effective at the expiration of 
ECA
20001006B.  The ECA shall be effective for a period of ninety (90) days.

Extraordinary Corrective Action 20001208B

Market Design Flaw Regarding Real-Time External Proxy Bus Prices


Applicability

This  Extraordinary  Correction Action (ECA) shall apply when the following
two conditions are met:

?    Transactions are proposed for an operating hour at an External Proxy Bus;
and
?    The Balancing Market Evaluation (BME) resolves transmission congestion
constraints at the External Proxy Bus for the operating hour, resulting in
transmission congestion charges in the Hour-Ahead Market (HAM).

Rationale

When BME solves for proposed transactions at an External Proxy Bus, and the
total  proposed  transactions  exceed  the available transfer capacity, BME 
will
resolve binding constraints at that External Proxy Bus using the decremental 
bid
price  or  the sink price cap bid indicated by the Market Participants 
proposing
the transactions.

In  the  operating hour, the transfer capability and scheduled flows at the
External  Proxy  Bus  are  fixed,  and  SCD  is  not  required  to  resolve  
for
transmission  congestion  costs  associated  with  the  scheduled  
transactions.
Therefore, in operating hours where an External Proxy Bus constraint is 
binding,
Real-Time  prices at the External Proxy Bus will be significantly different 
from
the  HAM  prices,  due  to  the  absence  of transmission congestion costs 
being
reflected  in  the Real-Time price.  Currently, scheduled HAM transactions at 
an
External  Proxy Bus are settled at the Real-Time price at the External Proxy 
Bus
during  the operating hour, and the import transactions receive a Bid 
Production
Cost Guarantee for the deviation in price between the HAM and Real-Time price.

The  Market  Design  Flaw  in  the  current  process  is  that transmission
congestion  constraints  present  when  BME  schedules  HAM transactions are 
not
reflected  in the Real-Time settlement prices.  Under the rules set forth 
below,
the  transmission  congestion  costs present in BME will be reflected in the 
SCD
prices, so that a Market Participant proposing a HAM transaction will be 
charged
the  full  cost of supplying that transaction, up to the decremental bid cost 
or
sink  price  cap  bid  indicated  by  the Market Participant at the time the 
HAM
transaction was proposed.

Implementation Rules

1.   These rules apply in hours that HAM import or export transactions are
constrained in BME at an External Proxy Bus (EPB) by a transmission limitation
or Desired Network Interchange (DNI) limit (an ?EPB Limit?).

2.   For each hour in which an EPB Limit constrains net imports to NYCA from 
an
External Proxy Bus in the HAM, the Real-Time settlement price at that External
Proxy Bus will be the lesser of the real-time LBMP or the BME price at that
External Proxy Bus.

3.   For each hour which an EPB Limit constrains net exports from NYCA to an
External Proxy Bus in the HAM, the Real-Time settlement price at that External
Proxy Bus will be the greater of the real-time LBMP or the BME price at that
External Proxy Bus.

Issued:  December 8, 2000, 3:00 p.m.
Effective:  January 10, 2001, Operating Hour Beginning 0000

As  you  know,  Enron  has  signed  a merger agreement by which Dynegy will
acquire  Enron.   We  expect the transaction to close following shareholder
and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even  though  Enron  has  entered  into  this  agreement,  U.S. and foreign
antitrust   laws   require  that  Enron  and  Dynegy  continue  to  operate
independently  of  each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and
Dynegy  are  competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective
activities  must  be  undertaken  at arm's length until the transaction has
closed.   Therefore,  for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you
would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In  addition,  all information, documents and communications related to the
merger  between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved
by  Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls
or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be
maintained.   To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to
Dynegy  under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved
by one of the foregoing individuals.

If  you  have  any  questions  concerning this notice, please contact Lance
Schuler  (713/853-5419),  Robert  Eickenroht  (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke
(713/853-6544)  or  Rob  Walls  (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in
this matter.

Alert Posted: 12:30 PM November 18, 2000: Demand Mismatch Order Notice
Effective Monday, November 20, 2000 at 10:00 a.m., and until further notice, 
AGLC is issuing a demand mismatch order for the following primary pools.
ATLANTA, MACON, AUGUSTA , and ROME
Based on the current supply levels and expected demand levels, AGLC's system 
cannot manage the potential excess demand and the operational integrity of 
the system will be threatened. Therefore, it is essential that your 
interruptible customer's demand does not exceed the scheduled supply for your 
interruptible market for each primary pool under the demand mismatch order.
Each shipper/pooler/marketer is responsible for contacting their 
interruptible customers to curtail demand if necessary to meet this order. 
Marketers/Poolers are responsible for maintaining interruptible customer 
contact information. Any customer contact information in GOS is for AGLC 
internal use and is not intended to be marketers/poolers point of contact for 
curtailments.

Mr. Campbell,

Attached is the PTE analysis for Martin Co. #1 using data provided by Ruth
Jensen.  The PTE for CO is approximately 99.38 tpy.  This is using the AP-42
factors for 4-cycle rich engines operating at less than 90% load.  This PTE
analysis is very close to the Title V limits.  CLose enough to warrant
verification of all parameters.  As you recall AP-42 factors for 4-cycle
rich burns used to be 10 g/hp-hr for equal NOx equal CO operations.  The
AP-42 engine factors were revised in 2000 which resulted in a big increase
in CO emissions.  If you use the current AP-42 factors for 90-105% load, we
bust 100 tpy for CO.

Brian_Grant@cargill.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

I have not had any response to questions about whether Don is right
about NYISO simply going back to the way things were, but making that
assumption, I offer the following solution:

In my mind the way the market should work is that there should be "bid
guarantees" in real time.  I do not agree with the fact that there are
production cost guarantees and not sink price cost guarantees.  If there
were guarantees to all HAM bids, that would in turn lead to a more
efficient northeastern marketplace.

An example of an export:

I bid in the DAM to export power from NYISO to PJM. I bid 50, DAM clears
40, so get accepted to export 100 mw's.  Before the HAM commitments take
place, prices in NYISO are 200 while prices in PJM are 20, so I decide
it would be economical to leave the power in NYISO.  I have the ability
to change the HAM bid created from my accepted DAM bid, so I change the
bid to 100...saying that if NYISO is willing to pay 100, then I am
willing to cut my schedule to PJM...NYISO is forecasting 200, so they
cut my schedule.  One of two things happens now, if realtime clears
above my 100 HAM bid, then I buy at 40(DAM) and sell at realtime...If
realtime clears at under my 100 HAM bid, then NYISO needs to provide the
difference between my HAM bid and the realtime px.  The logic here is
that in effect, I already owned power at 40(just like a 40 generator)
and was willing to sell back my "generator" at 100, so if someone
commits my generator at 100, then they should be responsible for
compensating me.

An example of an import:

I bid into the DAM to import power to NYISO from PJM.  I bid 50, DAM
clears 60, so I get accepted to import 100 mw's.  Before the HAM
evaluation, prices in PJM are 200 while prices in NYISO are 30.  So I go
into my HAM bid and change the price from 50 to 150...HAM predicts 30,
cuts my import...thereby I am selling the power at 60, and buying it
back real time...once again two things can occur here...realtime clears
under my 150 bid, so I sell 60(DAM) and buy realtime....or realtime
clears at over my bid...in which case I sell 60(DAM) and buy back at my
150 HAM bid....the logic here is that my power at PJM(my generator)
which had committed itself at 60 in the DAM, was willing to stay flowing
to NYISO at up to 150(my HAM bid)...ie I am willing to take the
financial risk between 60 and 150....NYISO did not commit me in HAM, so
my financial risk should be capped at what I am willing to risk, not
what NYISO says I should be willing to risk

barkerde@nmenergy.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:



Some feed back so far...... There appears to be a problem brewing with
the
planned implementation of the May 29 adjustment that removes the $20K
bias from
the DAM external transactions.I am awaiting a call back on my concerns
from the
NYISO. By occasionally settling hourly prices through BME or
occasionally
settling after SCD sets RT prices, depending on the extistence or non
existence
of congestion, a problem that we thought we fixed many months ago will
reappear
with the removal of the $20K bias.Here is an example of my musings....

DAM bid gets accepted at  $50 ( Import from PJM)  .....  BME  then runs
(No
constraints)  evaluating the import HAM bids and other items that have
BMEprovide a $40 price.... DAM gets cut  , looks like  a $10 profit  (
providing
your loss in PJM doesn't exceed $10) . Due to in hour operations the RT
price
clears at $60. You loooooooose!!  Sound familiar? After getting beat up
like
this the MP's went through the committee structure and had the $20,000
adder
used for DAM (except IS+) to protect against this. The clearing at BME
for all
external  proxy busses removed the problem so the $20,000 adder was
removed. Now
the external interfaces only clear at BME if they are constrained. Are
we taking
a huge step back on purpose or was there a mistake in implementation?

All,
?
Today, the FERC  issued an order rejecting NYISO's request to lift the 
$2.52/MW bid cap on its  non-synchronized reserve market and ordered that a 
technical conference be  convened to find solutions to the problems in the 
non-synchronized reserve  market and also the energy market and its design 
flaws (as requested by  EPMI).? The Commission rejected NYISO's request 
because of its failure to  implement changes in the non-synchronized reserve 
market ordered by the  Commission and because the changes that were made do 
not significantly reduce  concentration of that market east of the central 
east constraint, but said that  it would lift the caps once the market could 
be demonstrated to be workably  competitive.
?
Commissioner Hebert  disented, in favor of lifting the bid caps as well as 
the $1000 cap on the  energy market.? He continues to support modifications 
to NYISO's markets  that would allow other suppliers to participate.? Hebert 
feels that a  technical conference would be ineffectual.
?
Commissioners  Breathitt and Massey supported the order.? Chairman Hoecker 
expressed a  long list of apprehensions about the markets and the process in 
New York,  likening his concerns to those expressed recently by the 
Commission regarding  California.? He?cited the staff report on its 
investigation of the  northeast bulk power markets, finding problems with the 
balkanization of the  markets and supporting the formation of a single 
Northeast regional  operation.
?
The staff report can  be found at:

The "Rules, Procedures and Guidelines for the Summer 2001 Reconfiguration
Auctions of TCCs" will be posted on the NYISO web site on May 9th.  It can be
found on the NYISO web site by selecting "THE MARKETS" from the home page.  
Then
select "Transmission Congestion Contracts - TCC Market" and "Additional TCC
Auction Information".  The document is posted under the heading "Summer 2001 
TCC
Auction".  It is also provided as an attachment to this notice.

This document contains the "Sale Agreement" which must be completed and 
returned
to the NYISO via an overnight mail service by 5:00 PM on May 11th and the
"Purchase Agreement" which must be completed and returned to the NYISO via an
overnight mail service by 5:00 PM on May 11th.  The NYISO regrets any
inconvenience caused by the short notice.  Please note that these "Agreements"
are identical to those used for the Spring 2001 Initial Auction of TCCs except
for the relevant date references.

The revisions to these "Rules" are the following:

References to "Winter 2000/2001" were changed to "Summer 2001".
The address of the  Auctioneer was changed to the NYISO's Washington Avenue 
Ext.
facility.
The final version of the Time Line provided as Attachment C differs slightly
from the Preliminary Time Line posted on the NYISO web site.
Section 6.8 was revised and Attachment G was added to define the rules that
Buyers of TCCs using the HQ Proxy bus as a POI or POW must follow when
submitting their bids.

Fill YOUR Bank Account with our $420 Offer!

Build the future you want, with the index you can trust!
Are you looking to protect yourself from a market correction
or to protect your overall portfolio? Invest in something people
USE everyday and will continue to use everyday...COMMODITIES.

Don't just invest in stocks, diversify your portfolio with futures
and futures options and accomplish your investment objectives!
There has never been a better time, and the correct information
has never been more readily available!  Just look at the rise in
oil and and gas prices recently! Not to mention the information
available via the internet.

People were making money with commodities long before the internet
was even invented!  This an inexpensive alternative to "just stock"
ownership that can improve your overall portfolio by participating
in a broader worldwide market.

Can you imagine, for just one day, how people would react
if they thought could not have their first cup of coffee or
even some orange juice in the morning? What would happen to prices?

Do you watch the news and pay attention the signs around you?
At just a hint of a cold front, heating oil prices jump.
With just a hint of a frost in Florida or California,
orange prices jump. With just a hint of a hurricane heading
our way, plywood prices jump. Every year as vacation season
begins, gasoline prices jump.

This is the world of supply and demand...BUY LOW and SELL HIGH!
Do you remember when sugar prices shot up to $5 a pound?
A lot of early investors in sugar made absolute fortunes!

Commodities are used by people in literally every country
in the world. Such things as gasoline, heating oil, coffee,
sugar, corn, wheat, soybeans, apples, oranges, fish, beef,
and pork, are some of the more well known. You've probably
even heard of the infamous pork bellies! Let us show you
how you can participate and profit in this lucrative market
in the the new millenium!

Examples:
1) Due to oversupplies, combined the current lack of Asian demand,
the prices of corn wheat, and soybeans are at their LOWEST prices
in 20 years!  However, with a significant drought in some major grain
growing areas and early signs of economic recovery in Asia, grain
prices could increase substantailly soon. Learn how to speculate in
the grain markets by leveraging 25,000 bushels of corn,
wheat, or soybeans!

2) You can also profit NOW from today's high gas prices!
On a $5000 investment you can control over 420,000 gallons
of gasoline by using options. Just a 5 cent movement in your favor
means thousands of dollars of profit for you!

The Environmental Affairs Department is developing a list of ETS natural gas 
pipeline facilities where the  condensate throughput exceeds 30,000 
gallons/year.  In the coming weeks, the Division Environmental Specialists 
will be asking your operating teams for annual condensate throughput at all 
facilities.  Please impress upon the teams the importance of collecting and 
providing this information as we have committed to a first quarter 2002 
deadline to compile the list.  This request is especially critical in areas 
prior to processing as the likelihood of the annual condensate throughput to 
exceed 30,000 gallons/year increases in those areas.

Please  call me at (402) 398-7716 or email me if you have any questions about 
this request.  Thank you for your help!

HOLIDAY SAFETY REMINDER

The holiday season can mean an increased risk of fires and a higher potenti=
al=20
for criminal activity due to people taking advantage of convenient downtown=
=20
shopping and because of the increased number of special events and office=
=20
parties.  We would like to pass along a few safety and security tips from t=
he=20
City of Houston Fire Department and the Houston Police Department.

? Please do not prop open stairwell doors or doors to the freight elevators=
. =20
This defeats security.=20

? Use only artificial trees and greenery in decorating your office space. D=
o=20
not place cut trees or greenery within the building. Cut trees become major=
=20
fire hazards when they dry out.

? Office parties or the holiday mood may distract you.  Be alert for thieve=
s=20
who try to take advantage of the holiday season. Sometimes just having fewe=
r=20
people at work during the holidays creates an opening for thieves. If you s=
ee=20
someone that does not appear to belong in your work area, immediately call=
=20
the Enron Security Console at 713-853-5360.

? Keep your purse or wallet with you at all times or locked away in a drawe=
r=20
or closet.

? If you go shopping, invite a friend to go along. Try not to overload=20
yourself with packages.  When you return, lock your gifts away in a safe=20
place.

? Always be aware of your surroundings while in a public area. If things do=
n=01,
t look right, follow your instincts and avoid going into the area.

? When waiting for a ride home after hours, remain inside the building near=
 a=20
card-reader door until you see your ride arrive.=20

? If office parties are on company premises and involve alcoholic beverages=
=20
or public invitees, call security at 713-853-5360.  Security will advise yo=
u=20
as to company guidelines.

Attached in support of Agenda Item 5B , ICAP, for the December 12, 2000
Business Issues Committee meeting, and pursuant to the motion passed at the
December 1, 2000 BIC meeting, are the following documents:

1. A clean version of proposed Tariff language on Stage 1A ICAP, consisting
of all those modifications made by the ICAPWG over the course of their
deliberations in the last few months with the exception of  (1) UCAP and (2)
one month OPP; and

2. A blacklined version of that proposed Tariff, marked to show changes from
the current Tariff.

The clean version includes a table of contents for ease of review.

Please note that, pursuant to the motion passed by BIC on December 1,
substantive changes not included in the ICAPWG November 21 Proposed Tariff
(considered by BIC on December 1) must be presented on separate motion at
the December 12 meeting.  The ISO has one such change, to Section 5.12.10;
the language was circulated prior to the December 1 BIC meeting and will be
recirculated tomorrow.

Please call or write with questions or comments. Many thanks.

Hi Larry,

Since it's been two months since we have heard from you we wanted to check 
back with you and see if there is anything we can do to help you with your 
diamond buying decision? Our goal is to help you make an informed decision 
that you will be happy with for years to come.  Remember, since we don't own 
these stones, we are your personal diamonds consultants who will work to find 
the very best diamond for you at a great price.

Since you have not responded to any of our emails these past 8 weeks, we 
assume you are no longer shopping for a diamond and will remove your name 
from our active customer list.  We hope that if you are still shopping you 
will contact us so we can help you find a great diamond.

If you have any questions about diamonds or the diamond buying process please 
give Anne or me a call at the toll free number below or email us.  We take 
calls until about 9:00 p.m. EST since we are dealing with customers and 
suppliers on the West Coast.  We find that serious diamond buyers always want 
to call and visit with us so that we can better understand your needs and 
answer any of your questions.  Email works great for shopping, but the 
telephone is the better way to conduct business for such an important 
purchase.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon!

As this progresses please concentrate on spill history in excess of two years 
and any consent orders that apply to the assets.

From:  Campbell, Larry  
Sent: Thursday, May 03, 2001 4:30 PM
To: Belyeu, Randy
Cc: Kendrick, William; Richards, Joe
Subject: Environmental findings, Koch South Texas Records Review

Randy, this is a short summary of the environmental findings that were 
identified during the records review conducted at the Corpus Christi Koch 
facility offices on May 1st and 2nd of this year.

All environmental records which were available in the file data room at the 
Koch office  were reviewed.  Assumptions were made that the environmental 
records were complete for all assets included in the sale.  Primary emphasis 
was placed on those environmental issues which are normally associated with a 
sale or purchase of assets dealing with distribution and transmission of 
crude oil. In particular, pipeline and tank farms were the most critical 
assets which were reviewed. 

Based upon the data review, the Koch assets were in compliance with the 
following:

  Air permitting, permit by rule, standard expemtions, recordkeeping and fee 
payments were documented 

  NSPS recordkeeping and inspections for VOC control on large crude oil tanks 
were documented 

  Oil Pollution Act-OPA 90 plans had been prepared and were up to date

  SARA compliance and reporting had been completed

  SPCC plans had been prepared for each site which qualified under 40 CFR 112

  Spill reporting history and notifications to the state agency were 
available for review

   There are ongoing groundwater and soil remediation activities at one site 
included in the asset for sale
     (permits for the remediation activity is in place)

  Hazardous waste notifications, annual reportings and fee payments were 
documented

Based upon the above review, there were no issues which could be identified 
which would be condsidered a major environmental limitation or would be a 
considered a major environmental  liability.  This statement is again based 
upon the assumption that all environmental information was present in the 
data room for the assets in question.  It should also be stated that this 
analysis of Koch's environmental compliance is based upon the fact that Koch 
has not held back or provided false or misleading information or knowledge 
during their presentation or informaiton contained in the facility files.

Pending further development and interest of this potential purchase, a 
recommendation is made to conduct a phase I due diligence and site visit to 
each location to verify findings from the records review.   Also, due to the 
past history of Koch's operating practices, it is recommended that contract 
conditions be implicitly stated that EOTT will not be held liable for 
discoveries of past deficiencies or releases of contamination which have 
occurred on any of the Koch assets purchased.

Dear Market Participants,

With regard to a prior posting of Changes to OASIS/MIS/CSS Systems
(please refer to original at bottom) implementation of the item:

*  A new internal application for Operations to manage units
placed out of merit will improve coordination between Operations
and Grid Accounting for the purposes of accurate billing.

caused some visible changes in the MIS web pages
that were not explained in the original notice.

The screens which have changed are:

- Gen Bid Query Page - New value of 'MODIFIED' in the Bid Status
dropdown.  This will allow a user to select only bids that have a
status of 'MODIFIED'.

- Gen Bid Query Results Page - The status for a particular bid may
have a value of 'MODIFIED'.  Clicking on the bid status link will
list a message page with more information about the meaning of the
status.

- Gen Bid Page - The schedule information at the bottom of the page
may list a bid status of 'MODIFIED'.

- Gen Outage Page - Once fixed, the outage information will be
listed on an hourly basis since the outage information is now tied
to the bids.

- For the upload/download, the templates for submission and results
have not changed.  Retrieval of generator bids may have some
records with a bid status of 'MODIFIED', along with a message tied
to the meaning of the status.  The outage schedule information
(once fixed) will have the information listed on an hourly basis.

All of these screens have not changed in terms of layout or
functionality, etc.  There are just new possible values for some
of the query parameters and query results.

Thank you,
Customer Relations

5/16 - Trans Id. 5062820 shows 1033 mw R/T but we do not show this in 
EnPower.  However, deal 613492 in EnPower for 1270 mw does not go with 
anything with NY. The comments are not helping in identifying what 
transaction it goes with. Could you please advise.

Thanks,

What follows is a memorandum from William J. Museler to me invoking the
Temporary Extraordinary Procedures and requesting me to reissue ECA20000907A.
Immediately following the memorandum is the ECA itself.  It now carries the
number ECA20001208A.  The memorandum and the ECA are also being posted on the
OASIS.



MEMO


Date:          December 8, 2000

From:          William J. Museler, President & Chief Executive Officer

To:       Steven J. Balser, Manager of Market Monitoring and Performance
James H. Savitt, Market Monitor

Re:       Extraordinary Corrective Action to Address a Market Design Flaw:
HAM Transactions Failing Checkout (ECA 20001208A; re-issuance of ECA
20000907A)


Thank  you  for  the  presentation of the Market Monitoring and Performance
Unit  and  the Market Advisor regarding the progress that has been made with 
the
Market  Participants  in addressing the market design flaw concerning import 
and
export   transactions,  including  wheel-through  transactions,  that  fail  
the
check-out procedure between the completion of BME and the SCD operating 
hour.  I
am  pleased  that  the  Business  Issues Committee gave unanimous support to 
the
NYISO  to  re-issue ECA 20000907A until the Market Participants can consider 
and
approve,  and  the  NYISO can implement, a tariff change required to 
permanently
address the Market Design Flaw.

As  stated in my Memorandum to you of September 6, 2000, I agreed with your
conclusion that the conduct identified at that time constituted a 

?Market Design
Flaw?  as  defined  in  Attachment  Q  to  the ISO OATT, Temporary 
Extraordinary
Procedures  for  Correcting  Market  Design  Flaws  and  Addressing 
Transitional
Abnormalities (the ?TEPs?).  As further stated in that Memorandum, I agreed 
with
your  analysis that prices produced by exploiting this Market Design Flaw 
would,
absent  appropriate action, remain at levels different from what would 
otherwise
occur during periods of efficient competition.

I  have  now  determined,  based  on  consultations  with ISO Staff and the
support  of the Business Issues Committee, that it is appropriate to maintain 
in
effect  the  corrective measures adopted as ECA 20000907A while consultation 
and
cooperation with the Market Participants and jurisdictional agencies is 
on-going
to  develop  and  implement appropriate rules or rule changes in accordance 
with
the ISO Agreement.

Please re-issue the text of the Extraordinary Corrective Action (?ECA?) and
post  it  on  the  OASIS,  for implementation effective at the expiration of 
ECA
20000907A.  The ECA shall be effective for a period of ninety (90) days.

Extraordinary Corrective Action 20001208A:

Market Design Flaw Regarding HAM Transactions Failing Checkout


Applicability

This Extraordinary Correction Action (ECA) shall apply to:

?    Import and export transactions;
?    that are scheduled for an operating hour in the Hour-Ahead Market (HAM) 
by
the Balancing Market Evaluation (BME); and
?    that fail checkout for reasons within the control of the Market
Participant, or that are cancelled at the request of said Market Participant.

Wheel-through transactions shall be treated as both an import and an export
transaction, and the relevant Market Participant shall be billed the sum of 
both
financial impacts, as provided below.  This ECA shall not apply to import,
export, or wheel-through transactions that fail checkout due to NYISO error or
action, or neighboring control area operator error or action.

Rationale

Import Transactions: During the HAM resolution, BME reduces commitments for
energy  resources  within  NYCA  to  accept  scheduled  import transactions 
at a
specific  proxy  bus  indicated  by the Market Participant.  Where the 
scheduled
import  transaction  fails checkout following BME, the real-time energy price 
at
the  proxy  bus  may  be  elevated  above the HAM price due to the failed 
import
transaction.   The  difference  between the real-time price and the BME price 
at
that  proxy  bus is currently charged to all purchasers in the real-time 
market.
Under  this  ECA,  this  amount  (when  positive),  multiplied  by the number 
of
megawatts  of  the  transaction  for  that  hour,  shall be billed to the 
Market
Participant that scheduled the failed import transaction as the financial 
impact
of causing the failure to complete checkout of the transaction.

Export  Transactions:  During the HAM resolution, BME makes commitments for
energy  resources  to  supply  scheduled  export transactions up to the 
purchase
price  indicated  by the Market Participant at the appropriate proxy bus.  
Where
the  scheduled  export  transaction  fails checkout following BME, the 
real-time
energy  price  at  the proxy bus may be depressed below the HAM price due to 
the
failed  export  transaction.   The  difference  between  the  BME  price and 
the
real-time  price  at that proxy bus is currently charged to all loads as part 
of
Schedule  1  costs.   Under this ECA, this amount (when positive), multiplied 
by
the number of megawatts of the transaction for that hour, shall be billed to 
the
Market Participant that scheduled the failed export transaction as the 
financial
impact of causing the failure to complete checkout of the transaction.

Wheel-Through   Transactions:  During  the  HAM  resolution,  BME  includes
scheduled wheel-through transactions up to the transmission congestion cost 
that
equals  the  decremental  bid  indicated  by  the Market Participant.  Where 
the
scheduled  wheel-through transaction fails checkout following BME, the 
real-time
energy  price  at  both  the  import  and export proxy busses may be elevated 
or
depressed,  respectively,  due  to the effects on transmission congestion of 
the
failed wheel-through transaction.  Under this ECA, the effects of the import 
and
export  portions  of  the  failed  wheel-through  transaction will be 
calculated
separately,  as though they were separate failed transactions.  The sum of 
those
impacts  shall  be  billed  to  the Market Participant that scheduled the 
failed
wheel-through  transaction  as  the  financial  impact of causing the failure 
to
complete checkout of the transaction.

Implementation Rules


1.   An External Transaction for the delivery of energy to the NYCA at an
external Proxy Generator Bus that is scheduled in BME but for which no energy 
is
delivered to the NYCA in real-time, will be settled by the scheduling entity
selling the amount of energy scheduled in BME into the LBMP Market at the
scheduling entity?s BME Bid Price, and buying the energy that was not 
delivered
from the LBMP Market at the Real-Time LBMP prevailing at the external Proxy
Generator Bus.  No payment will be required of the scheduling entity if it is
shown that the External Transaction was properly scheduled in each Control 
Area
and the energy was not delivered due to an error or action by the NYISO or the
delivering Control Area.  No payment will be required of, or made to the 
Market
Participant if the Real-Time LBMP at the external Proxy Generator Bus is lower
than the BME Bid Price of the entity that failed to deliver scheduled energy.

2.   An External Transaction for the receipt of energy from the NYCA at an
external Proxy Generator Bus that is scheduled in BME but for which no energy 
is
received from NYCA in real-time, will be settled by the scheduling entity 
buying
the amount of energy scheduled in BME from the LBMP Market at the scheduling
entity?s BME Bid Price and selling the energy that was not taken into the LBMP
Market at the Real-Time LBMP at the external Proxy Generator Bus.  No payment
will be required by the scheduling entity if it is shown that the External
Transaction was properly scheduled in each Control Area and the energy was not
taken by the scheduling entity due to an error or action by the NYISO or the
receiving Control Area.  No payment will be required of, or made to the Market
Participant if the Real-Time LBMP at the external Proxy Generator Bus is 
higher
than the BME Bid Price of the entity that failed to take scheduled energy.

3.   An External Transaction for the delivery of energy to the NYCA at one
external Proxy Generator Bus and the delivery of energy from the NYCA at a
different external Proxy Generator Bus that is scheduled in BME but for which 
no
energy is delivered to or received from the NYCA in real-time, will be settled
by applying rules 1 and 2 of this ECA separately to the failed delivery of
energy to the import Proxy Generator Bus and the failed receipt of energy at 
the
export Proxy Generator Bus, and summing the total of the two amounts for 
payment
by the scheduling entity.  No payment will be required by the scheduling 
entity
if it is shown that the External Transaction was properly scheduled in each
Control Area and the energy was not taken by the scheduling entity due to an
error or action by the NYISO or the delivering or receiving Control Area.  No
payment will be required of, or made to the Market Participant for the import 
or
the export portion of the External Transaction if no payment would have been
required had that portion of the transaction been a separate transaction under
rule 1 or 2 of this ECA.

A TRUE FRIEND

When you are sad ...
I will get you drunk and help you plot revenge
against the scum sucking bastard who made you sad.

When you are blue ...
I'll try to dislodge what ever's choking you.

When you smile ...
I'll know you finally got laid.

When you are scared ...
I will rag you about it every chance I get.

When you are worried ...
I will tell you horrible stories about how much worse it could be and tell
you to quit whining.

When you are confused ...
I will use little words to explain it to your dumb ass.

When you are sick ...
Stay the hell away from me until you're well again, I don't want whatever
you have.

When you fall ...
I will point and laugh at your clumsy ass.

This is my oath ...
I pledge till the end. Why you may ask? ...
Because you're my friend.

Alert Posted: 1:45 PM November 19, 2000 Demand Mismatch Order Notice
Effective Tuesday November 21, 2000 at 10:00 a.m., and until further notice, 
AGLC is issuing a Demand Mismatch Order for these three additional primary 
pools; VALDOSTA, SAVANNAH, BRUNSWICK
Therefore , starting  Tuesday November 21, 2000 at 10:00 am ALL primary pools 
will be under A Demand Mismatch Order.

Based on the current supply levels and expected demand levels, AGLC's system 
cannot manage the potential excess demand and the operational integrity of 
the system will be threatened. Therefore, it is essential that your 
interruptible customer's demand does not exceed the scheduled supply for your 
interruptible market for each primary pool under the demand mismatch order.
Each shipper/pooler/marketer is responsible for contacting their 
interruptible customers to curtail demand if necessary to meet this order. 
Marketers/Poolers are responsible for maintaining interruptible customer 
contact information. Any customer contact information in GOS is for AGLC 
internal use and is not intended to be marketers/poolers point of contact for 
curtailments.

"Kirkpatrick, Joe" <joe.kirkpatrick@nrgenergy.com> writes to the 
NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:



Generators are supposed to be dispatched in the DAM in accordance with
their generator commitment parameters, many of these parameters are not
respected.
The minimum runtime is the one that is garnering the most attention, but
there is another parameter that would appear to be modeled incorrectly
which can have a significant impact on both the penalties applied to
generators and also on the issue of system security as it is applied to
system reserves.

Generators are loaded in the DAM in accordance with their loading rates,
the minimum loading rate for generators is 1% of their maximum rating. A
500 MW unit will have a loading rate of 5 MW/minute.

As an example of how SCUC loads generators I will use actual dispatch
data from Arthur Kill 2.

Arthur Kill 2 has a maximum rating of 359 MW and therefore has a loading
rate of 3.6 MW/minute.
The unit minimum is 90 MW and when dispatched from one hour to the next
should be constrained to what the unit can actually load.

We have received dispatches on our unit that would have the unit loaded
to 90 MW on average for one hour and then loaded to 241 MW for the next
hour. If the unit started loading at the end of the hour and loaded at
its loading rate of 3.6 MW/minute the unit would have loaded to 306 MW
by the end of the next hour. the unit would have loaded 3.6 MW/minute *
60 minutes or 216 MW. The increase of 216 MW represents an average of
108 MWhrs for the hour. Add the 90 MW from where the unit started from
its previous hourly dispatch and you will have an average for the next
hour of 198 MWhrs, this represents the maximum hourly average this unit
can perform and yet SCUC has the unit loaded to an average of 241 MWhrs.
This is impossible for the unit to load to and should represent a
deficiency for this hour in the DAM.

To further increase this problem SCUC has accepted the reserve bids from
this unit for both 10 minute spin and 30 minute spin for the hour that
the unit was already loading at its maximum loading rate. Since the unit
is already loading at its maximum rate, the unit should not be
considered for reserve since it cannot participate.

This problem is not isolated to this particular unit and is replicated
on our other units also.
If generators cannot follow their DAM schedules they must buy this
energy from the R/T even though it is impossible for them to match their
physical capabilities against their financial obligations as they are
dispatched to in the DAM. Add this to the fact the unit(s) are unable to
provide reserve to the system when they are already loading at their
maximum rate represents a system security problem.

I would suggest that SCUC only load generation at what the generation
can actually load to and be restricted to a maximum change hour over
hour of 30 minutes times their loading rate and if the unit is already
loading at its maximum rate then it should not be able to participate in
the reserve market.

I may be missing something but then again maybe not, hence the note to
the TIE list if other generators are affected in a similar fashion.

I might offer another simplistic solution that makes a whole lot more
sense in my mind:

Why doesn't the NYISO just separate their energy and transmission
markets?

barkerde@nmenergy.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:



What if a product called External Transmission Reservation Rights (ETRR)
was
conjured up that would allow a MP to reserve in/out ISONY transmission ?
MP's bid on 50 mw blocks for a month. The numbers of mws made available
is
variable. The winners get the blocks with a bid block attached. For
example ,on
the PJM/NY interface 100 mws of ETRR's  for exports were sold in two
blocks of
50. The winner's are given the bid blocks of 9999 and 9998 respectively.
The
highest anyone not owning a ETRR could bid on the external interfaces is
+/-
9900 thus insuring the assigned bid blocks first acceptance of their
bids. Thus
the winners of the ETRR's (having already paid the ISO for the space)
have the
ability to schedule the energy or not. Obviously this is an idea in the
most
simplistic form that will allow the purchasing of long term transmission
in a
financial transmission market. What do you think???

Mark, Thanks very much for your observations in response to my environmenta=
l =20
memo. I think I understand some of your concerns about the role of the ISO=
=20
in  general and, in particular, with regard to conservation programs. There=
=20
are  several ways in which I think the NYISO is inextricably involved with=
=20
energy  efficiency:=20

The current competitive market the NYISO is overseeing is quite simply not =
=20
working when it comes to demand or load responding to prices. Supply or =20
generators are responding to price=01*imperfectly, but there is significant=
 =20
response. So we have "half a market." We should be seeking to put demand on=
=20
a  par with supply=01*treating load equally with generation. We are moving =
in=20
the  direction of facilitating that, but with basically all consumers on fl=
at=20
or  average rates, and with almost all LSEs (the regulated distribution=20
companies)  able to pass along their energy costs, there is little basis fo=
r=20
responding to  high prices even when we have the software mechanisms in pla=
ce=20
to do so.  Someone needs to find a way to have consumers confronting real=
=20
prices=01*or at  least paying a risk premium for not having to do so. Someo=
ne=20
needs to find a  way to have LSEs have a financial incentive to keep prices=
=20
down=01*they don=01,t  now. One way LSEs could do so would be to encourage =
their=20
(fixed price)  customers, through incentives, to reduce their use when pric=
es=20
are high.  Environmentally, there is a lot at stake in getting the market t=
o=20
work right,  and the ISO plays a major role in that, even when it is not it=
s=20
immediate  responsibility.=20
The emergency measures the ISO is considering have very significant =20
environmental impacts. Small diesel generators may be needed to avoid the =
=20
significant social costs of outages. One environmental concern here is that=
 =20
such generators be restricted to emergency conditions, and not become a new=
 =20
breed of economic peak clippers. And also, it seems reasonable that the =20
emergency program "clean up after itself" by having offsets or mitigation =
=20
associated with it. Actual demand reductions are a preferable alternative =
=20
since they do not have health and environmental impacts=01*and help lower=
=20
market  prices at the same time.=20

I don=01,t mean to suggest that the NYISO is responsible for all of the iss=
ues =20
raised here=01*clearly the PSC, DEC, NYSERDA and others have very important=
=20
roles.  I think the NYISO needs to work with these other agencies to get=20
competition to  work more or less right, and pull down prices and protect t=
he=20
environment at the  same time.=20

Sorry if I have fallen into the trap of repeating myself=01(at length. Than=
ks =20
for your comments.

Larry

In addition to adjustments to billing units due to the receipt of billing
quality
metering data, this settlement adjustment includes the following billing code
modifications/corrections:

   Billing code was modified to model scheduling & dispatch of grouped
   generators
   for settlement of energy & bid production cost guarantee payments.
   Generators
   affected by this modification should see proper payment of those 
quantities.
   Any
   costs incurred by the NYISO will be recovered from transmission customers
   through
   their OATT Schedule 1 residual & BPCG adjustments
   For the December settlement adjustment, billing code was modified to ensure
   that
   appropriate prices corrections resulting from ECA-B were captured in the
   billing.
   This may impact transmission customers whose transactions were subject to
   ECA-B
   treatment, resulting in transmission usage charge adjustments.  Any costs
   incurred
   by the NYISO will be recovered from transmission customers through their 
OATT
   Schedule 1 residual adjustment.
   For the December settlement adjustment, a number of grandfathered rights &
   TCC
   configurations were corrected.  Customers affected by this would see either
   their
   TCC's converted back to grandfathered rights, or vice versa.  Any excess or
   deficiency
   in cost recovery will be balanced with the Transmission Owners, based upon
   their
   respective megawatt-mile coefficients.
   There was a code modification to allow for Class 2 PURPA generators to sell
   all
   over-generation to the real-time market.  This would result in payment to
   those
   affected suppliers.    Any costs incurred by the NYISO will be recovered 
from
   transmission customers through their OATT Schedule 1 residual adjustment.

Not that many of you care.? But since I am  moving to Tulsa, my computer will 
be down for awhile and my email is going to be  shut off this Friday.? 
Therefore, I am going to have to move over to my  hotmail account.? The 
address is scotlilly@hotmail.com? However,  because of the limited space on 
hotmail, I will have to ask you not to send  (large) forwards for awhile.? I 
will write everybody when I get a new ISP  and tell you guys the new 
address.?

should be paid for personally.

To order photos taken at the 2000  EES Holiday Party you will
need to go to www.enron.photofete.com.

   not need either of these)

On the right hand side of the home page it says "search events".

   Click on this link.

   This will bring you to a search screen.

The easiest way to locate the pictures from Saturday night is to search by

There were three photographers present and the photos taken have been posted
separately to help speed up the process of finding your photo among the many

Vince - 

I certainly appreciate the opportunity to have our group attend
a session given by Enron Research.  While afternoons are typically
the best time to meet, we do have a trader's meeting each Mon & Wed
at 3:30.  If we can accomodate this regular meeting either by scheduling
an earlier meeting on Monday or going for Tue/Thurs, that would be 
great.  Otherwise we can go ahead with the Mon @ 3:30 with an audience
that might be a bit smaller.

Thanks again

George

Subject:  Cancellation of May 1, 2001 BS&P call on credit policy

We previously agreed to hold a conference call meeting May 1 in
anticipation of having sufficient progress from the Credit Policy Working
Group (CPWG) to review.  After speaking with Andy Ragogna this afternoon, I
do not believe the CPWG is close enough to a detailed proposal to have a
productive conference, after all.  Consequently, I am canceling the May 1 
call.

Additionally, it appears unlikely at this point we will have a proposal
ready for the May 10 Management Committee  meeting. My report will simply
be a progress report on the Credit Policy issue, and a report on our plans
to develop this year's budget and goals recommendations.

FREE                             SHIPPING on all  orders over $100, through 
November                             22.

7.

We've                             teamed  up with Toysrus.com  to offer you 
toys and savings so massive, even  our                             North Pole 
competitors are envious. 
?

6.
Create                           a Wish List      at Amazon.com and you just 
might win everything on  it--up                           to $5,000. Woo-hoo!
?
5.
By                           shopping early at  Amazon.com,  you eliminate 
stress. Carolers won't seem nearly  as                           irritating. 
?
4.
Though                           reindeer are  cute, our delivery service is 
more reliable.                           And  no fog delays. 
?
3.
                           You can browse through all 17 of our  stores 
without                           being accosted by a persistent  perfume 
sales clerk.
?
2.
                           Free parking. 
?
1.
SHIPPING                           IS FREE on  orders of $100 or more. (Our

Kayne,

I've noticed some confusion lately on which CP name to use in EnPower for 
Ameren transmission - Ameren Services Company (ASC) is the right one.  If you 
could pass this along I would appreciate it.

Thanks,
Michael

Today is the last day for the discount subscription  price for our indexes. 
When you subscribe, you get our historical data to date.  Contact Jeff Maack,

To meet your needs, we are now posting the Cin and  Ent indexes each weekday 
by 9:15 a.m. If you send us prices, please do  so by 6:30 a.m. each day.

WILL YOU PLEASE INFORM YOUR NIGHT CREW that we're  calling each night to get 
deals? Some have been reluctant to divulge prices, not  realizing we've 
cleared their participation through the heads of the trading  desk/hourly 
desk.
?
Feel free to pass along the following (in  bold):

To: 24-hour desk crew
From: (hourly trading  manager)

TradersNews is now posting the hourly indexes each day at 9:15  a.m. CPT, to
facilitate financial swaps off the indexes. Please provide them  (Ellen 
Clardy,
Suzanna Strangmeier and Bobette Riner) with prices and  volumes, as well as 
the
source and sink for each hourly peak deal that  day.

They are indexing Cinergy, Entergy and AEP, and are collecting  prices to 
build
historical data for TVA, ComEd and SPP. The information will  not be published
until the NEXT day, and at no time will TradersNews identify  who did what or 
for
how much.

Thank you for your  cooperation.

If you or your crew have any questions (for  example, re: hub definitions),
please contact us. We thank  you!

There are numerous emails floating around with suggested changes to the
EDRP and DADRP Manuals. This makes it very difficult for BIC members to
know what is to be voted on Thursday.

Either those wanting changes should come to BIC with motions to modifiy or
we put off the approvals at the moment until there is a better fix on what
it is we are voting for...(or hold revisions for later).

The list I have is years old.  Fortunately, the names in Deal Entry and Deal 
Blotter are alphabetical so you do not need to know the codes.  The power 
short codes are not consistent with the NERC codes so this would probably not 
help you.  Attached is a list of CPs with whom we deal.

Dean Laurent mentioned that you had a list of all counterparties with their

hourly power desk can be sure to enter deals correctly in Enpower.  Thanks.

My house is finally ready for its first party!  Please join me for some 
cocktails, finger foods, music, and overall good spirits!

It's going to be Saturday, May 19 starting anytime after 6:00PM until Sunday 
7:30AM.  (That's when I go to church.)  May 19 is not this weekend.  It's 
next weekend.

I'll have a mix a domestic beers (including light), with some hard liquor, 
soft drinks, vegetable tray, and munchies.  (Feel free to bring any 
'specialized' booze that you may desire.)  Join in me in the fun!  Bring a 
friend.

Please RSVP so I can get an idea of how of you rapscallions will show up.  
Email me or call me at the phone numbers at the bottom.


What? Party at Mike's townhouse

Why?  Any of the following reasons:
   The start of spring
   Celebration of your tax refunds
   To meet Moz and Josie, my 89-year old neighbor
   It'll be a great time

Where? On Bellefontaine Street, just South of the intersection of Buffalo 
Speedway and Holcombe.     (Holcombe is the same street as Bellaire.)

Address? 3200 Bellefontaine   #72   (Zip: 77025)

Directions:From 59-North
  Exit at Buffalo Spwy.  Take right on Buffalo Spwy heading south.  I live in 
the Grammercy Park complex.      Grammercy Park is the first complex on the 
right-hand side of Buffalo Spwy immediately after the church (St. Vincent     
De Paul ) on the corner of the intersection.
  You can park in the following places:

intersection.
   C)  in the parking lot on the left-hand side of Buffalo Spwy by 
Blockbuster.
  You'll see balloons or something pointing you in the right direction when 
you get close.  Look for       garage with the # 72 over it.  It's easy to 
find.

Dear Datek Online Customer,

The equity in your account has fallen below margin maintenance
requirements, creating a Margin Maintenance Call (or "House Call") as of
November 8, 2000.

Amount Due: The house call is for $ 1836

Date Due: This call is due by the close of business on Monday, November
13, which will be Day 3 of the house call.

Please be aware that Friday, November 10, 2000 is a bank holiday.  Banks
will not be open to wire transfer funds.  If you plan on funding your
account to meet your margin call, please wire funds to Datek Online
prior to Friday.  Once you have wired your funds remember to have your
bank provide you with a wire receipt containing a federal reference
number.

Datek Online only accepts a faxed copy of the wire receipt including the
federal reference number as proof of funds forthcoming.  Please fax your
wire receipt to 732-744-9143.

If you choose to overnight a check to Datek Online, please confirm with
the carrier that they will be delivering on Friday.  U.S. Post Offices
will not open and will not be delivering mail on Friday November 10,
2000.

The call requirements can be satisfied by:

1.  Depositing sufficient funds into your account to satisfy the entire
amount of the call.
2.  Selling sufficient securities in your account to satisfy the entire
amount of the call.
3.  The market value of your portfolio appreciating above equity
requirements.

What you should do:

A margin call requires you keep a watchful eye on the value of your
portfolio.  Be mindful of market fluctuations in your portfolio and how
they affect your account.  A margin call is payable on demand, and
rapidly depreciating market conditions may require immediate action
involving liquidation of sufficient securities in your account to
satisfy the call without further notice from us to you.  Taking the
necessary steps to satisfy the house call can avoid this.

This margin call must be satisfied by the close of the market on Monday,
November 13.  You should immediately decide which call payment method is
best for you.  Do not delay in satisfying the call.  Please take
immediate action to satisfy this call prior to the close of the market
on Monday, November 13, 2000-DAY 3. If your account does not meet margin
equity requirements as of the market open on November 14-DAY 4 we will
be forced to take action to satisfy the call by selling some or all of
your portfolio.

Sending Additional Funds to Meet Your Margin Call

The amount stated above is the amount of the call that may be met by
depositing additional funds (cash) into your account.   The fastest way
to deposit funds is to send a wire.

If you choose to wire funds you must:

1.   Fax a copy of the wire receipt
2.   Include the federal reference number of the wire
3.   Fax to 732-744-9143

Important Note
Datek Online only accepts a faxed copy of the wire receipt including the
federal reference number as proof of funds forthcoming.


If you choose to send a check by overnight mail you must:

1.   Include your UserName and account number on your check
2.   Mail to:
Datek Online
Attn: Cashiering Department - Margin Call
100 Wood Avenue South
Iselin, NJ 08830-2716

Important Notes:

? We do not accept an air bill number, a copy of a check or phone or
email confirmations as proof of funds forthcoming.
? We must receive and credit funds sent by overnight check by the close
of business on Day 3 for your margin call to be met.

Liquidating Positions to Meet Your Margin Call

In order to liquidate enough stock to meet the initial amount of your
margin call you must do the following:

1.   Determine the margin requirement for the position you wish to
liquidate.   Stocks with special margin requirements can be found on our
HelpDesk under "Your Portfolio" and "Margin Maintenance" or by using the
following link:

http://www.datek.com/helpdesk/margin.html

2.   Divide the amount of the margin call by the margin requirement for
the position you wish to liquidate.  This is equal to the dollar amount
of the security you must sell to meet the initial amount of the margin
call.

Example:

The amount of the margin call is $1500.  To determine the dollar amount
of a security you must sell to meet this margin call divide $1500 by the
margin requirement for the stock you wish to liquidate.  If the margin
requirement is 30% (.30) you must sell $5000 worth of the
position.  If the margin requirement is 40% (.40) you must sell $3750
worth of the stock.

Your Call Could be Satisfied Through Market Fluctuation

Margin calls are calculated after the close of business on a daily basis
using the closing prices for each day.  In order for you to meet your
margin call through market fluctuation your account must close the
traditional trading day above the minimum margin maintenance
requirements.  This must be done by the close of November 13-Day 3 in
order for the call to end.  Intra-day market fluctuation will not
suffice in meeting your margin call.

Please do not assume your call will be satisfied because stocks in your
portfolio are "bound to go up". All stocks are subject to market
volatility. There are no guarantees that a stock price will rise or
assurances that a stock will not decline. Furthermore, your stocks could
decline further, creating an even larger margin call. Once again, do not
"bank" on market fluctuation. Consider all factors, including your risk
tolerance, to take a realistic view of how to handle the margin call.


Account Equity and Additional House Calls

Depending on the securities you are holding in your portfolio and their
market fluctuations, additional funds may be due or actions that are
separate from this margin call may be required.  This may result in a
second house call.  The key is to understand the equity requirements and
ensure that your account is meeting them.  We may request additional
margin maintenance due to:

? A further decline in the market value of your positions.  At that time
you may meet a margin call only to be issued a second one because the
equity in the account has declined below a point where the initial
margin call no longer brings the account to the acceptable equity level.
In these instances, meeting the initial call may give you additional
time to meet the second call but the account must be returned to the
required equity ratio.
? Any undue concentration of one security in your account.

Needless to say, selling out an account is something we don't like to do
at Datek Online.  We want you to be aware of the status of your margin
account at all times, and be prepared to take action as soon as
conditions warrant.  Be fully aware that if at any time your account
value falls to approximately 10% equity, or if market conditions
warrant, we reserve the right to close out some or all of your positions
with or without notice, at our sole discretion.  You should review our
HelpDesk to check equity requirements.

If you have any questions please send email to support@datek.com or call

rbowers@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

On April 24, 2001, the NYISO deployed code changes affecting Class 1 PURPA
transactions in the billing system and modified bid status flagging in the
MIS.  These changes impacted settlements for 4/10, 4/11, 4/13, and 4/18 -
forward.

There was a code design problem with the PURPA code change that resulted in
an error in the computation of balancing energy for some class 1 units that
resulted in their purchasing their entire day-ahead schedules in the
balancing market.  There was also an oversight in the implementation of the
modified bid status flagging in the MIS such that those bids were not
transferred into the billing system, impacting bid production cost
guarantee settlements for the units with a modified bid status.

The NYISO will be issuing a supplemental invoice for April 2001 settlements
on Tuesday, May 15th to adjust for the aforementioned issues.  Funds due
the NYISO for this supplemental invoice should be transferred into the
NYISO Clearing Account by close of business Wednesday, May 23, 2001.  Funds
due Market Participants from the NYISO for this supplemental invoice will
be transferred into Market Participant accounts by close of business
Friday, May 25, 2001.

PLEASE NOTE THAT: Funds due the NYISO for the April 2001 settlements which
were invoiced on May 7, 2001 should be transferred into the NYISO Clearing
Account by close of business Wednesday, May 16, 2001, as scheduled.  Funds
due Market Participants from the NYISO for the April 2001 settlements
invoiced on May 7, 2001 will be transferred into Market Participant
accounts by close of business Monday, May 21, 2001, as scheduled.

MAPP OASIS WILL BE DOWN TONIGHT, for 1 HOUR!

Dear MAPP Transmission Providers and Customers,

On Wednesday, May 16th at 11:30pm CDT the MAPP OASIS NODE will be taken
off-line for approximately 1 hour for database maintenance.  At the same
time the latest version of OASIS software will be installed , v2.7.0d.

How does this effect MAPP Transmission Providers:

The new version of OASIS software allows for specific redirect service
types.  Two new option fields have been added to the service types, "Allow
on Redirect" and "Account on Reduction".

These two fields can be changed by selecting "Transmission Services" under
Provider Maintenance, and then click on the ID to update the transmission
service.

The "Allow on Redirect" option determines whether the service type appears
in the drop down box on the REDIRECT transmission request template.

The "Account On Reduction" determines whether REDIRECT request types appear
in the "Query for Reductions".

All services types will default to "No" for
the two new fields for existing transmission services.

Requirements:
Before the upgrade
1.  All "Capacity Type" entries must be unique for each transmission
provider.  Please change your "Capacity Types" so that they are unique.

 The "Capacity Type" will be changed by the MAPPCOR staff at the time of
upgrade if the unique "Capacity Type" for each provider is violated.

After the upgrade
1.  If you do have Redirect transmission service types then select "Yes" for
the "Allow on Redirect" field.

The MAPP OASIS Test node is available for testing version 2.7.0d.  The test
node can be accessed at:
http://mappb3.oasis.mapp.org/OASIS14/NODE/MAPPB3

How does this effect MAPP Schedule F Customers:

MAPP Schedule F Transmission Customers should select "HNF Secondary" as the
Service for redirecting a CONFIRMED MAPP Schedule F Firm reservation as
Non-Firm.

In addition, to redirect a CONFIRMED MAPP Schedule F Firm
reservation on Firm basis then one of the following services should be
selected "FCTS Daily", "FCTS Weekly", "FCTS Monthly", "FCTS Seasonal", "FCTS
Yearly", and "FCTS Monthly 1 Month" depending on the remaining duration.

Please try to have your business needs concluded prior to this outage.  We
apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

Please contact the MAPP Transaction Coordinator if you have further
questions at 651.632.8508 or at transcoords@mapp.org.

Thank you in advance for your cooperation.

Sincerely,

MAPP Transaction Coordinator

Romance in Paradise!

Dear Larry,

Everyone has their own definition of paradise. For some it's 
unspoiled beaches and lush tropical jungle. For others it's a more 
developed resort. For others, it's not about the outdoors at all--if 
you're one of those people who thinks a place called "Sin City" 
sounds just about perfect, we can help you, too. However you like it, 
Travelocity can help make it happen. Whether you're traveling with 
your sweetie, or just into the romance of traveling, Travelocity can 
help you plan and book the perfect trip. And that sounds like 
paradise to us.

Ann,
Please read the note below related to one of our guys who participates on the 
SW Environmental Team.  Does this really present a problem for the PRC 
process (when I believe there are forms available through the SDWT Manual for 
review purposes)?  I hope Roger Sumlin will correct me if I am too far off 
base on this.  At a minimum I wanted to give you a heads-up that this was a 
problem for the Bakersfield Plant folks and Scott Jones in particular.  John

John/Bill I was speaking with Scott Jones in Bakersfield and he wanted me to 
pass along to you that the server for Bakersfield has been down for the last 
two weeks and is expected to be down for an additional two more weeks.   He 
has been very limited in receiving his email and even less limited in sending 
anything out.   I know this will impact his PEP and interim review responses 
that he is to complete by the May deadline, but he's become a victim of 
circumstance.    His telephone number is 661-765-4087x9 if you should need to 
discuss anything with him.

Dear Market Participants,

On November 15, 2000, the New York Independent System Operator,
Inc. filed a reformatted version of the NYISO Open Access Transmission
Tariff (OATT).  The new version is entitled New York Independent System
Operator, Inc.,  FERC Electric Tariff,  Original Volume No. 1.

This filing was made to comply with the FERC's Order No. 614, issued
March 31, 2000 in Docket No. RM99-12-000, 99 FERC   61,352 (2000).
Order 614 amended the FERC's regulations concerning the designation
of electric rate schedule sheets. This order changed the titles and
other administrative information to be shown at the top and bottom of
each tariff sheet, thus necessitating that the NYISO modify the information
included on the NYISO's tariff sheets.

The tariff filed on November 15, 2000 does not include any change in
the content of the tariff.  It does include the administrative changes
described above and a repagination and reformatting to facilitate
existing and future changes.  This tariff includes all tariff modifications
that were filed before September 1, 2000, and have been approved by the
FERC.  The tariff does not reflect filings made on or after September 1, 2000.
The tariff also does not reflect the NYISO's February 11, 2000 compliance
filing in Docket No. ER97-1523-029, which still awaits Commission action.

Once this tariff has been approved by the FERC, the NYISO will create and
post a consolidated version of the OATT that shows all approved and
proposed changes.  This new consolidated version will be comparable to
and replace the current consolidated OATT posted on the NYISO website.

The November 15, 2000 filing can be found on the NYISO website at:

With all that has been going through about the price change for the
16th, I have one question that I would like to have clarified for
future reference.  Suppose that I had bid to export power from NYISO to
PJM and put in a sink price cap of -900.00.  Suppose that then I got
accepted as the price cleared at less than -900.00.  The power was then
scheduled with NYISO and subsequently scheduled with PJM, creating
financial obligations on both ends.  What would happen to the economics
of this schedule in this case?

Given the sale, etc of the units, don't sell any power off the units, and 
don't run the units (any of the six plants) for any reason without first 
getting my specific permission.

Thanks,

Mitch

Outage:  eol net change
Environments Impacted:  EOl
Purpose: 
We have found that IP multicast storms on the EOL internal subnet 172.16.21.0 
briefly incapacitate the EOL firewall eolfw1.  To solve the problem, we will 
insert a new VLAN/subnet 172.16.23.0 between 172.16.21.0 and the firewall so 
that no IP multicast traffic will reach the firewall interface.  Physical 
work includes running two copper cables from trd-cx[12]-3405 port 6/7 to 
eolfw1 and logical work entails defining the new VLAN on the 
switches/routers, enabling interface vlan23 and changing

ip route 192.216.56.0 255.255.255.0 172.16.21.4
ip route 192.216.57.0 255.255.255.0 172.16.21.4

			How 'Bout Some Tonic With That Gin?
			The game of Gin was Hollywood's game. When it stormed through that town in 
the '40s, you could see Gin being played on the silver screen by all types of 
movie stars. Refined in the early 1900s at the Knickerbocker Whist Club in 
New York, Gin is the perfect social card game. It's not so strategic as to 
preclude chatting, but it still provides real competitive kick and a gleeful 
way to gloat when the cards are laid down, and "Gin" is scored. Not every 
online gaming site has Gin. But it's taking off on PlaySite. Take a break 
from your day and try it!

			Tournament Time
			What better way to test your gaming skills than to compete in an online 
tournament with other top-ranked competitors? PlaySite offers automatically 
scheduled tournaments in seven games: Backgammon, Checkers, Chess, Go-Moku, 
Hex, Mancala and Reversi. Some games have tournaments geared for the 
beginning player. Backgammon has tournaments for those rated Under 1500 and 
an Open class. Checkers and Chess both have tournaments for those rated Under 
1300 and a separate Open class. 
			
			Playing in a tournament is easy and fun. Go to your favorite game page, and 
click to enter the tournament room. You'll see areas for tournament info, 
signups, games, a history of prior tournaments and a schedule for upcoming 
tournaments. PlaySite tourneys run throughout the day. Get a complete look at

I hope you're able to do the same at your summertime events 
this year.  We've included some tips in this newsletter to 
make sure you're prepared to capture those memorable 
moments.  Have fun!  

Cheers,

"Stephen Fernands" <srfernands@cesolution.com> writes to the 
NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Mark,
Thank you for your thoughtful response.  I think you raise some valid
points, but I do not think they change the end conclusion.

Fundamental Value of ICAP
The principle of the ICAP market, as in any market, should be to reflect the
value of the underlying product that is being sold to the market.  The
question is whether the product being sold, in this case ICAP, has truly
appreciated more then 400% since the previous ICAP auctions.  Maybe - but I
doubt it.

AMP and Expected Revenue
The premise that changing the existing market mitigation rules to catch rule
breaking on a real time basis instead of a one day lag basis, although
plausible, seems fairly weak.  It presumes that generation owners were
planning on violating the pre-existing screens and counting on the revenue
from those "golden eggs."  Likewise, the link between "expected energy
revenue" and ICAP prices is tenuous at best.  Generators are not limited to
receiving revenue from the spot market and may well choose to sell energy in
the bilateral market.  In either case the goal of the generation owner is to
maximize revenue through all markets.  The ICAP market, if functioning
properly, should reflect the value of the first call on the energy from the
generator by the NYISO and the ability of the NYISO to curtail external
transactions from that generator.  For example two generation owners owned
two plants with the same characteristics. One generation owner did a
relatively "good" job selling a forward energy contract for the 6 month
procurement period while the other owner did a relatively "poor" job selling
a similar contract.  In the ICAP auctions they both should have the same
strategy - maximize the revenue that each of them can receive out of the
ICAP auction.  Any other strategy by either of the plants will lead to
overall lower profits.

Price Cap Load Bidding (I won't comment on if Virtual Bidding were in place
because it isn't going to be)
Price Cap Load Bidding has been available in the past, only know it is
expanded slightly to Zonal Price Cap Load Bidding.  This is not a
significant change to the existing rules and would seem unlikely to account
for either a significant change in the expected energy revenue or the
underlying value of the ICAP product.

"...significant uncertainty to the New York market..."
I would agree that all of the rule changes including the Penalty and Public
Disclosure Proposal  made it difficult for generation owners to properly
evaluate the effects of selling ICAP into a 6 month market.  For this
reason, as well as the other possible reasons listed on my letter, I believe
that mitigating measures should be evaluated.  I am not passing judgment at
this stage, but feel that all parties should know that the prices that were
posted are in the process of being reviewed and that subsequent changes may
be required to some or all of the months.

Next Steps
If the MMU determines that there was economic and/ or physical withholding,
whether due to regulatory uncertainty in surrounding control areas or
internal uncertainty about the exact effects of the AMP, I believe that it
is most appropriate for the MMU to take immediate action and refer it to the
committees for longer term resolution.

> NYISO markets. There also had not been the broad range of price control
> measures proposed and adopted for this summer.  Compared to last summer,
> ICAP bids for this summer would have incorporated better understanding of
> the expected profits in the energy market as well the expected impacts of
> the price control measures.  Second, he also uses the results of this
> summer's strip/monthly auction and the deficiency auction as an indication
> of there being problems in the ICAP market.  Because the entire ICAP
> requirement is not cleared in a single auction, the prices that are bid
into
> the earlier auctions are essentially an ICAP providers estimate of its
> opportunity cost of selling in the earlier auction rather than selling in
a
> later auction.  This requires the ICAP providers to guess the likely bids
of
> the marginal ICAP providers.  The results of this years auctions merely
> indicate that those who sold in the early auctions apparently did not do a
> very good job of guessing the lost revenue associated with selling in the
> earlier auctions.
>
> Mr. Fernand's provides a set of proposed measures for addressing the ICAP
> issue.  If any of them are worthy of be considered then they should be
aired
> through the committee process.  Nonetheless, one of the proposals should
be
> killed at the outset.  Because being an ICAP provider to New York includes
> an obligation to bid into the energy market, no ICAP owners should ever be
> "automatically bid into the Deficiency Auction" or any other auction.  Mr.
> Fernand's suggests that that the automatic bidding requirement be relieved
> if a Long ICAP Owner exclude itself.  The act of choosing not to bid into
> the ICAP auction is in itself an indication that the ICAP provider has

Dear Santa: 

Listen you fat little troll, I've been  helping you out every year, playing 
at 
being the perfect Christmas present,  wearing skimpy bathing suits in frigid 
weather, and drowning in fake tea  from one too many tea parties, and I hate 
to break it to ya Santa, but IT'S  DEFINITELY PAYBACK TIME! There had better 
be some changes around here this  Christmas, or I'm gonna call for a 
nationwide meltdown (and trust me, you  won't wanna be around to smell it). 

So, here's my holiday wish list,  Santa: 

1. A nice, comfy pair of sweat pants and a frumpy, oversized  sweatshirt. I'm 
sick of looking like a hooker. How much smaller are these  bathing suits 
gonna 
get? Do you have any idea what it feels like to have  nylon and Velcro 
crawling up your butt? 

2. Real underwear that can  be pulled on and off. Preferably white. What 
bonehead at Mattel decided to  cheap out and MOLD imitation underwear to my 
skin? (It looks like  cellulite). 

3. A REAL man... maybe GI Joe. Hell, I'd take Tickle-Me Elmo  over that 
wimped-out excuse for a boyfriend Ken. And what's with that  earring anyway? 
If I'm gonna have to suffer with him, at least make him and  me anatomically 
correct. 

4. Arms that actually bend so I can push  the aforementioned Ken-wimp away 
once he is anatomically correct. 

5.  Breast reduction surgery. I don't care whose arm you have to twist, just 
get  it done. 

6. A sports bra. To wear until I get the surgery. 

7. A  new career. Pet doctor and school teacher just don't cut it. How about 
a  
systems analyst? Or better yet, an advertising account executive. 

8.  A new, more '90s persona. Maybe "PMS Barbie," complete with a miniature  
container of chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream and a bag of chips;  
"Animal Rights Barbie," with my very own paint gun, outfitted with a fake  
fur 
coat and handcuffs; or "Stop Smoking Barbie," sporting a removable  Nicotrol 
patch and equipped with several packs of gum. 

9. No more  McDonald's endorsements. The grease is wrecking my vinyl. 

10. Mattel  stock options. It's been 37 years, I think I deserve it. 

OK, Santa,  that's it. Considering my valuable contribution to society, I 
don't think  these requests are out of line. If you disagree, then you can 
find yourself  a new bimbo doll for next Christmas. It's that simple. 

Yours truly,

Attached are a clean and blacklined revised version of Attachment J to the
proposed ICAP Manual that will come before BIC on May 24. The Attachment J
circulated last week had some glitches in it. This Attachment J has been
blacklined against the one circulated last week so you can readily see the
differences.

I apologize for any inconvenience.

Hi Larry,

Since it's been a month since we emailed you our list of recommendations, we 
wanted to check back with you and see if there is anything we can do to help 
you with your diamond buying decision? Our goal is to help you make an 
informed decision that you will be happy with for years to come.  Remember, 
since we don't own these stones, we are your personal diamonds consultants 
who will work to find the very best diamond for you at a great price.

If you have any questions about diamonds or the diamond buying process please 
give Anne or me a call at the toll free number below or email us.  We take 
calls until about 9:00 p.m. EST since we are dealing with customers and 
suppliers on the West Coast.  We find that serious diamond buyers always want 
to call and visit with us so that we can better understand your needs and 
answer any of your questions.  Email works great for shopping, but the 
telephone is the better way to conduct business for such an important 
purchase.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon!

P.S.
If you have already purchased, please let us know in a reply to this message 
so we will know not to send any more follow up messages.

Denny Reinke - Vice President

     s)  You go to the drugstore for Ibuprofen and antacids, not condoms
     and pregnancy test kits

     t)  A $4.00 bottle of wine is nolonger "pretty good stuff."
       (could this be Boone's Farm)

     u) You actually eat breakfast foods at breakfast time.

     v) Grocery lists are longer than macaroni & cheese, diet Pepsi, and

     y)  You don't drink at home to save money before going to a bar

Dear Sir or Madam :

=20
accordance with the highest ethical standards.  Accordingly, employees of=
=20
Enron and its subsidiaries are required to comply with Enron's Business=20
Ethics Policy which requires an employee to conduct himself/herself in a=20
manner which is not detrimental to the best interests of Enron and which do=

not bring to the employee financial gain separately derived as a direct=20
consequence of his/her employment with Enron.  Further, Enron's Business=20
Ethics Policy states that no lavish entertainment or gifts are to be given =
or=20
received by Enron employees for special position, price, or privilege.

 Not only is it incumbent upon our employees to follow this policy, but you=
r=20
cooperation in respecting these standards is also critical.  Enron expects=
=20
each of its vendors and contractors to maintain adequate records that=20
document its work relationship with Enron.  Enron's auditing department wil=

routinely conduct business ethics compliance audits of certain vendors and=
=20
contractors with whom Enron does business.  Your recognition of our ethical=
=20
standards allows Enron employees to work with you via arm's length=20
transactions and avoids potentially embarrassing and unethical situations. =

If you ever become aware of variances from our policy, please advise:

I've emailed my friend my review for Finding Forrester, starring Sean
Connery, Anna Paquin and newcomer Rob Brown.  You can wait until he posts
the review on his website or just email me for the review.  I think he's
pretty busy since he hasn't posted my review for Unbreakable yet.

In any case, the url for the movie review site is:
http://users.ev1.net/~solt/movie_menu.html

book mark it and check back for reviews of future movies.

Here's a listing of the permits expiring over the next year or so:

 GW-90  Portales C.S.  Expires 2/27/02
 GW-89  Corona C.S.  Exprers 3/9/02
 GW-95  Laguna C.S.  Expires 3/9/02
 GW-109 Carlsbad C.S.  Expires 5/18/02
 GW-110 Mountainair C.S. Expires 5/18/02

 GW-283 Jal C.S.   Expires 6/24/02
 GW-285 Bisti C.S.  Expires 9/24/02

As you know, if you get your renewal applications in 120 prior to the
expiration date, the permit will not expire on the dates above, but will
extend until all paperwork is done on my end.

We need to go out and look at all of these at some point in time, but I will
get back with you to set up a schedule.

Take care and have a good Thanksgiving.

Repayment Procedure  

I called MAPP to get a better understanding of the pending Dec. 18th LRP 
changes as explained in detail below.
Currently the "source" generator is responsible for the Losses.  The new 
policy states that the Scheduling customer is now responsible for Losses.  
MAPP is implementing this change as a requirement under their tariff.  
Changes to software and systems has delayed this change from being 
implemented any earlier.
What it means to Enron as a Schedule F customer:
 1)  Enron (or any Schedule F customer) is responsible for  losses based on a 
yet to be published Loss Matrix that MAPP will provide on it web page.  The 
loss  calculation matrix and methodolgy will not change, just the party 
responsible for providing the losses.  When scheduling energy, Enron must  
either schedule physical losses or buy losses from a designated Source 
Scheduling participant (SSP).  The SSP will then be responsible for 
disbursing the losses to each designated CA a week later.
The identity of the SSP will be the Source of power (if a MAPP member), or 
the POR on your Schedule F (If Source is outside MAPP).

Subject: Notice of Pending Changes (effective 12/18/2000) to MAPP's Loss 
Repayment Procedure


Notice of new MAPP Loss Repayment Policies and Procedures

At the direction of the Regional Transmission Committee of MAPP, new Loss
Repayment Policies and Procedures will be implemented on December 18, 2000.
These changes make the transmission customer, as identified on the OASIS
reservation, responsible for paying energy losses on MAPP Schedule F
transmission service.  Previously, the MAPP Source entity has been
responsible for paying these losses.  These changes do not modify the
application of MAPP's Loss Repayment Procedure (LRP) to MAPP Member Open
Access Transmission Tariff (OATT) customers.  Changes to the administration
of Schedule F loss repayment include:
o The Schedule F transmission customer will now be responsible for the LRP
losses on their energy schedules.
o Payment of third party impacts due to "through flowing" Schedule F
transactions (where the Source and Sink are both outside MAPP) will be
included in the LRP.
o To facilitate the payment of third party losses, the Customer will make
arrangements with the Source Scheduling Participant (SSP), as defined on the
transmission reservation, to pay for energy transaction losses at the onset
of a schedule.
o The SSP will bank the losses for repayment of third party losses, one week
later, to the day. The repayment is done, as it is today, according to a
schedule sent out by the MAPP Center.
For additional information please see the business practices section of
MAPP's Schedule F OASIS:
http://mapp.oasis.mapp.org/documents/MAPP/practices.html

Questions may be e-mailed to Tom White at the MAPP Center:
ts.white@mapp.org

Answers to frequently asked questions will be posted at the URL given above.

A copy of the revised section five of the policies and procedures document
is attached.

After reading Pete's update on MIS changes that will go into effect May 29,  I
have tried the phone route with the NYISO and haven't found a live person to
answer a question I have regarding the $20,000 day ahead adder. The removal of
the $20,000 adder was supposed to be in conjunction with the proposal passed 
by
BIC and MC back in Sept, where the external proxy busses would clear at BME
instead of LBMP. Subsquently it was determined that due to soft ware 
limitations
and the study that long term prices indicated that the BME clearing prices 
would
have big uplift impact since BME averaged higher then the LBMP. The answer was
to automate ECA06B so that when there was congestion that only the proxy bus
effected would clear at BME, in effect eliminating the need for the $20,000
adder. Soooo the question is: Is the automated ECA06B going to be in place May
29?
Another thought along these lines...Will the removal of the $20,000 adder to
non constrained proxy busses pose a problem for those who don't want their DAM
schedules bumped by HAM schedules? Will simply babysitting your schedules by
changing the HAM bids be sufficent?
Since I'm on a roll, what about the fact that according to Tech Bull. 61 that
IS+ is still changing Export Sink Price Caps to a -$100 Dec Bid in spite of 
the
fact that BIC and MC back in Sept passed a motion to change this so that the 
Dec
bid would be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign from the SPC Bid? Which 
is
wrong, Tech Bull 61, IS+ or me? Please only pick one, and it must pertain to
this narrow question.

Dear Market Participants:

The NYISO back-up dispatch system is scheduled to be tested on Tuesday,
December 5.    The test will begin at about 10:30 a.m. and last for
approximately one hour.

Security Constrained Dispatch (SCD) will be stopped, but the mainframe 
computer
will
continue to operate, allowing the NYISO to monitor security.  If a situation
occurs, the
Shift Supervisor will be able to re-start SCD and take appropriate action.  
The
Market
Information System (MIS) and Balancing Market Evaluation (BME) will remain
available
during the test.

If you have any questions, please call Customer Relations  at 518-356-6060.

Hey Guys,

We have been researching PJM transmission settlement and have found an 
inconsistency in how deals are settled in PJM and 
how they are getting into Enpower.

I would like to propose that any deal for transmission be entered into 
Enpower as documented below.  Please come to me if you 
have any questions.

Volume Management is attempted to set up a process to reconcile these volumes 
on a daily and monthly basis, so bear with us 
until the process is in place and everyone is up to speed.

Thanks,

Rebecca


PJM TRANSMISSION PROCEDURE

Every time an OASIS request is accepted in PJM a deal is entered into 
Enpower...  

 1)  with a demand volume equal to the amount reserved
 2)  demand price of $0.67
 3)  trans volume equal to the volume FLOWED (or expected to flow)
 4)  trans price of $0.48
 5) Comments with the PJM OASIS number for reference (buy and sell 
transaction ids if available)

Examples:

A) If EPMI reserve 100mw of transmission on peak for the whole month, but we 
are not sure if or when we are going to use it, enter 
demand volume of 100mw and trans volume of zero, and then when it is used 
change the trans volume in Scheduling to the amount 
that actually flowed.

B)  If EPMI reserves 50mw for HE8-12 and expects to use it, enter demand 
volume of 50mw and trans volume of 50mw, and then of it 
is cut change the trans volume in Scheduling to the amount that actually 
flowed.

When the corrected generator prices were posted for the 5 May 2001
real-time market, the zonal prices were inadvertently left at their
uncorrected levels.  The updated file for the 5 May 2001 prices posted
today -- 14 May 2001 -- contains the corrected zonal prices as well as the
originally corrected generator prices for 5 May 2001.

Alert Posted: 2:45  PM November 18, 2000  RE- (REVISED) Demand Mismatch Order 
Notice
Effective Monday, November 20, 2000 at 10:00 a.m., and until further notice, 
AGLC is issuing a demand mismatch order for the following primary pools. This 
notice is revised to include the Ex- Atlanta Southern Group and The Ex- 
Atlanta Transco Group. We apologize for the confusion the previous alerts may 
have caused.
ATLANTA, EX-ATLANTA SNG,  MACON, AUGUSTA , Rome and EX-ATLANTA TRANSCO.
Based on the current supply levels and expected demand levels, AGLC's system 
cannot manage the potential excess demand and the operational integrity of 
the system will be threatened. Therefore, it is essential that your 
interruptible customer's demand does not exceed the scheduled supply for your 
interruptible market for each primary pool under the demand mismatch order.
Each shipper/pooler/marketer is responsible for contacting their 
interruptible customers to curtail demand if necessary to meet this order. 
Marketers/Poolers are responsible for maintaining interruptible customer 
contact information. Any customer contact information in GOS is for AGLC 
internal use and is not intended to be marketers/poolers point of contact for 
curtailments.

 Organization Announcement (Correction) 

I apologize for the confusion and inconvenience my mistake caused.  I had 
indicated that Kenneth Lovejoy would be supporting EES, but this is not 
correct.  Ken will be supporting  OEC.  Corrected announcement is provided 
below. 

 It is my pleasure to announce that Kenneth Lovejoy has joined Enron Corp. 
EH&S Asset Operations.  He will be reporting directly to Donnie Willmann and  
will support Central America, Caribbean and OEC.  Ken has over 25 year 
experience in environmental, health and safety for the oil and gas 
industry.   He has been working for Enron since 1996 and has extensive 
international experience.    We are excited to have Ken in our team so, 
please welcome Ken in his new role.

Henry  Van

Steve Fernand's comments on the recent ICAP deficiency auction results are
based upon a fundamental misunderstanding of the ICAP market.  This
misunderstanding is summarized in his statement that "Unlike the electric
commodity, there have been no significant changes in the underlying costs
for suppliers of ICAP."  Since last summer there have been very significant
changes in the factors that affect the ICAP markets in New York.

The basic principle of the ICAP market is that it provides the generator (or
external ICAP provider) a mechanism to recover costs that are not adequately
recovered from the energy market.  In return for this revenue the generator
accepts an obligation to bid into the NYISO day-ahead energy market every
day that the generator is not out of service due to either maintenance or
forced outage.

The basic theory on developing a bid into the ICAP market for an internal
generator is that the generator should estimate the total revenue it
requires from the ICAP market to continue operating. This calculation is
based upon its total cost of remaining in business less its expected profits
from the energy market (expected revenues less expected fuel costs).  For
external suppliers the ICAP bid is based upon the opportunity cost of being
obligated to the New York energy market rather than being either obligated
to another market or having no obligations to any market.

Clearly, in each case, the bid into the capacity market is dependent upon
the expectations of the New York energy market.  There have been several
adopted and proposed changes in the New York energy markets that make them
both less desirable than last year and less desirable than the energy
markets surrounding New York.  These include:

The Circuit Breaker/AMP - The Circuit Breaker/AMP creates both a concern
that the day-ahead market prices will be depressed from the levels that
should exist.  The implementation of the circuit breaker raises concerns
that the market prices in New York energy price will be depressed.  The
potential ways in which the DAM prices could be depressed include failure to
incorporate changing unit operating parameters, fuel costs, or emissions
costs.  Additionally, while opportunity costs are a part of an acceptable
bid, there is no methodology to keep the circuit breaker from effectively
removing the opportunity costs for a circuit broken bid.  Finally, the
design of the circuit breaker may result in numerous individual bids by
different market participants being circuit broken when they are not
exercises of market power.  Every time a bid is improperly circuit broken it
affects all sellers because all sellers end up being paid less in the DAM
then they should have received.

In addition to these questions about whether the AMP will improperly depress
prices, there is still uncertainty to how  a generator that has been
improperly mitigated is supposed to be able to be compensated.  This was
part of the original circuit breaker design but as of this point the NYISO
has failed to provide any description of how this process will work.  There
is also uncertainty about the reference prices and the process that
generators will follow in getting changes or exceptions to the reference
prices accepted.  The uncertainty raises the cost of being obligated to the
New York market.

Price Capped Load Bidding - The price capped load bidding mechanism that is
being implemented this summer provides a sophisticated tool to a small
subset of market participants to determine whether they want to purchase at
the DAM market prices.  This provides the possibility that day-ahead market
prices will systematically be depressed relative to the real time market if
this mechanism is abused.  Virtual load bidding has been blocked for the
summer.  If virtual load bidding were implemented it would provide a
potential check on this market manipulating behavior.  The only check
allowed in our market design is the inclusion of opportunity costs in the
generator day-ahead market bids.  As addressed above, the application of the
Circuit Breaker/AMP is likely to impede the generators including opportunity
costs in their bids thereby eliminating the only check on using the price
capped load bids to manipulate the market.

Penalty and Public Disclosure Proposal -  This proposal will penalize market
participants that are mitigated for exceeding the NYISO Market Mitigation
Measures. There have been issues raised related to this proposal regarding
due process and fundamental fairness.  The penalties only apply to
generators and other suppliers.  The penalty is not based upon a
determination that the market participant has exercised market power.
Finally, the ADR process can determine whether mitigation was properly
applied by the NYISO but cannot determine whether the penalty that was
applied was appropriate.

Each of the above measures has resulted in a potential reduction in energy
market revenues and added significant uncertainty to the New York market.
The above price control measures are not in place in the surrounding
markets.  Each of these makes the New York market less desirable than its
neighbors and raises the price of being obligated to the New York market.
Interestingly, the Penalty and Public Disclosure Proposal was approved by
the NYISO Management Committee between the ICAP Monthly auction and the ICAP
Deficiency auction.

The above are not the only price control proposals that have been made for
the NYISO energy market.  Most notably, there have been proposals for $150
price caps in the energy market and retroactive price authority.
Fortunately, both of these ill-considered proposals were ultimately
withdrawn.  However, the mere fact that they were proposed inflicts
uncertainty on the energy market and therefore increases the expected prices
in the ICAP market.

Two final points need to be clarified regarding Mr. Fernand's argument that
the results of the auction indicate a problem.  First, he lists the change
in ICAP market clearing prices between last year and this year as indicating
there is a problem in the ICAP markets.  When generators bid into last
summer's auction they had not yet experienced summer operation under the
NYISO markets. There also had not been the broad range of price control
measures proposed and adopted for this summer.  Compared to last summer,
ICAP bids for this summer would have incorporated better understanding of
the expected profits in the energy market as well the expected impacts of
the price control measures.  Second, he also uses the results of this
summer's strip/monthly auction and the deficiency auction as an indication
of there being problems in the ICAP market.  Because the entire ICAP
requirement is not cleared in a single auction, the prices that are bid into
the earlier auctions are essentially an ICAP providers estimate of its
opportunity cost of selling in the earlier auction rather than selling in a
later auction.  This requires the ICAP providers to guess the likely bids of
the marginal ICAP providers.  The results of this years auctions merely
indicate that those who sold in the early auctions apparently did not do a
very good job of guessing the lost revenue associated with selling in the
earlier auctions.

Mr. Fernand's provides a set of proposed measures for addressing the ICAP
issue.  If any of them are worthy of be considered then they should be aired
through the committee process.  Nonetheless, one of the proposals should be
killed at the outset.  Because being an ICAP provider to New York includes
an obligation to bid into the energy market, no ICAP owners should ever be
"automatically bid into the Deficiency Auction" or any other auction.  Mr.
Fernand's suggests that that the automatic bidding requirement be relieved
if a Long ICAP Owner exclude itself.  The act of choosing not to bid into
the ICAP auction is in itself an indication that the ICAP provider has
chosen to exclude itself.

FOR SETTLEMENT DISCUSSIONS ONLY

Summary of Customer Comments and Southern's Responsive Proposals
Docket No. RP00-476

I.  OFOs AND PENALTIES

Comment 1:  Provide objective criteria for issuing and lifting OFOs
including information that will help customers better understand operational
situation being addressed

Response:  SNG does or will post warnings and forecasts in advance
of OFOs and will work with customers to clarify tariff language on a
mutually agreeable basis

Comment 2:  A $15.00 penalty for Type 3 Alert Mode OFO is not reasonable;
$7.50 is more reasonable

Response:  In the spirit of compromise, SNG would be willing to
decrease the penalty to $10.00 per dth as part of a settlement package.

Comment 3:  The short notice and harsh penalty of the Type 3 Emergency Mode
OFO is unreasonable for the following reasons:
- Customers need more time to make adjustments
o Only implement if a Type 3 Critical Mode OFO
is already in place
o 12 hours notice would be more appropriate
- Limit application to abusive shipper behavior
- Clarify tariff that penalty only applies at start of gas day
and not intraday
- Shorter notice is not justified because if implemented too
late, a firm shipper cannot bump IT on last nomination cycle
- Justify adding the gas price to the penalty
- The increased penalty price is really an increase in
imbalance charges without other benefits
- Use Gas Daily's "Midpoint Louisiana - Onshore South" daily
index price instead of the one proposed

Response:  As part of a settlement package, SNG is willing to make
the following changes to its Type 3 Emergency Mode OFO.
- Type 3 Emergency Mode OFO can be implemented at the start of
the gas day on (i) 20 hours prior notice, or (ii) 4 hours prior notice ONLY
if a Type 3 Alert or Critical Mode OFO is in effect for the previous day;
telephone notice will be given when the penalty is upgraded to Emergency.
- Language limiting the application of each OFO is set forth
in Section 41 of the tariff's general terms and conditions.  SNG is willing
to repeat this language in this specific OFO section of the tariff, however,
so that customers feel comfortable that implementation of this penalty will
be targeted to the operational problem areas on the system or specific
offenders whenever possible.
- SNG will clarify that penalties only apply at the start of a
gas day and can be cancelled during a gas day if not needed due to a change
in conditions.
- Since advance notice must always be given prior to the start
of a gas day (9:00 a.m. CCT), shippers can adjust nominations on the
Intraday 1 nomination cycle (10:00 a.m. CCT) and bump IT.
- At the meeting, SNG will further discuss the reasons its
penalties (including the higher penalty for Type 3 Emergency Mode) are
needed to preserve the operational integrity of the system.

Comment 4:   The change to Type 5 OFOs could result in a shipper in a group
being penalized even if it is within tolerance at a point

Response:  At the meeting, SNG will review an example of how the
proposed changes to the Type 5 OFO will actually avoid shipper-specific
penalties at a point when the point or group of receipt points is within
tolerance.  This provision will only help, never hurt, a shipper.


II.  SEGMENTATION

Comment 1:  SNG currently allows firm shippers to segment their capacity by
rate zone.  It should be operationally feasible to provide more
segmentation, especially along Southern's two main trunklines.

Response:  SNG has reviewed its operational model and has isolated
two "long line" segments of its pipeline along which it could allow
intrazone segmentation in an operationally feasible manner.  At the meeting,
SNG will review the physical attributes of its system that led to this
model.  To be able to provide this level of intrazone segmentation, the
program would have the following attributes:
- SNG will retain its existing segmentation program, but will
layer on top of that the ability for a shipper to fully segment along
identified long line segments of its north or south system up to the firm
capacity that the customer has on the long line being segmented.  For
example, if a customer has north system capacity into zone 2, it can do
intrazone segmentation along the long line portion of the north system
through zone 2 up to its contract quantity on the north system.
- On the long line on which the shipper has firm capacity, the
shipper can nominate to primary or secondary delivery points so long as the
nominations do not overlap along the long line segment.
- The shipper will have to path its receipts and deliveries
for the portion of its nomination where it wishes to do intrazone segments.
This allows SNG to verify that segments do not overlap.  The first delivery
point being segmented can be served by an upstream supply pool or storage,
but all downstream segments must be served by physical receipt-to-delivery
combinations.
- Allocated receipts serving an intrazone segmented delivery
would have to meet or exceed the segmented delivery to avoid overlapping
segments and qualify for the FT commodity rate.
- SNG is in the process of determining the programming
requirements to add this new, more complex model and will provide an
estimate at the meeting.

III.  CAPACITY RELEASE AND SCHEDULING EQUALITY

Comment 1:  SNG should allow customers to offer and bid on capacity release
deals before each of the four nomination cycles.  (In its filing, Southern
has offered to enhance its capacity release procedures to allow prearranged,
non-biddable deals to be awarded prior to each nomination cycle, but keep
biddable deals awarded according to the GISB standards prior to the Timely
Nomination Cycle.)

Response:  While Southern is not required to offer these additional
options under Order No. 637, it would be willing, as part of a settlement,
to add an offer/bid capacity release opportunity prior to the Evening
Nomination Cycle.  GISB is developing standards for intraday capacity
releases, and Southern proposes to wait until the standards are approved to
offer more flexibility due to the programming complexity.

Comment 2:  Changes that require programming should be implemented as soon
as possible if ready prior to the time estimated by SNG in its filing.

Response:  Southern will implement all changes as soon as the
programming is ready, and it will give 30 days advance notice of the
implementation date.

Comment 3:  Southern should allow releases of FT-NN service on a no-notice
basis as soon as possible.

Response:  As noted in its filing, Southern is in the process of
programming this functionality and proposes to implement it on March 1,
2001.  Southern plans to make its tariff filing in mid-January 2001, and
will host a conference call to discuss the tariff filing in early December
2000.

IV.  IMBALANCE MANAGEMENT AND MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS

Comment 1:  Customers need more than 3 business days to elect to trade
imbalances because imbalances are not final at the time of the election
deadline.

Response:  Effective December 1, 2000, for November imbalances,
Southern has filed to implement the new GISB standard that gives customers
17 business days after the end of the month to elect to trade imbalances and
to complete the trades.

Comment 2:  Southern should allow customers to use other customers' CSS/ISS
storage accounts to resolve imbalances at the end of the month.

Response:  While Southern is concerned that this may increase the
level of imbalances, in an overall settlement, it would be willing to add
this option, subject to active confirmation by the other customer whose
storage account is used to resolve the imbalance.

Comment 3:  Imbalances and overrun penalties should be based on the lesser
of operational or actual data.

Response:  Southern calculates both an estimated imbalance
percentage (on the last day of the month) and an actual imbalance percentage
and uses the lesser of the two percentages when cashing out imbalances.  On
the overrun comment, Southern bills all volumes actually metered, but fills
up a customer's firm transportation service within a zone prior to billing
IT overrun.

Comment 4:  Cash out revenues in excess of the index prices, less expenses
incurred by SNG for cash out gas, should be credited to the SCRM account.

Response:  Southern does credit all revenues received for cash out
and will provide an overview of the items that affect the SCRM account at
the meeting.

Comment 5:  Southern received comments in support of and in opposition to
the collection of injection or withdrawal fees on the net imbalance resolved
with storage at the end of the month.  It was suggested that Southern should
go further and collect the fee on the daily (instead of net) imbalance
resolved through storage.

Response:  Southern believes that its proposal is reasonable and
equitable for the reasons given in its filing.

Comment 6:  Southern should be required to honor discounts to alternate
delivery points within the capacity path of the point receiving the
discount.

Response:  Generally, FT reservation charge discounts continue to
apply even when alternate delivery points are nominated.  Any limitations on
the applicability of the discount to specific points will be agreed to as
part of the discount and will be set out in the discount exhibit.

ddechiaro@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:


The Credit Policy Working Group, which has been assigned by the Budget,
Standards, and Performance Subcommittee to address the details necessary to
develop a NYISO Credit Policy, I believe is converging on a proposal that I
expect will be drafted and available from NYISO staff by May 18.  Since the
BSP has been assigned by the Management Committee to recommend a credit
policy, the full BSP needs to review this proposal and attempt to reach a
consensus position to recommend to the Management Committee at its June 6
meeting.  Absent that, we need to able to present majority and minority
proposals.

In anticipation of this proposal being available May 18, and consistent
with the goal of presenting a recommendation to the Management Committee
for a vote at its June 6 meeting, I am scheduling two BSP meetings (in
addition to the May 21 which is to address business planning goals).

The first meeting will be Tuesday, May 22, 2001, starting at 9:30 AM in
Conference Room "WA" at the NYISO offices on Washington Avenue Extension in
Albany.  You are encouraged to participate in person since NYISO staff will
be presenting the details of the proposal, however, the following call-in
number is available for those who cannot be there:

Dial In Number:          (505) 242-2420

Participant Code:   265727

A second meeting is scheduled for Wednesday, May 30, 2001, starting at 9:30
AM in Conference Room "WA" at the NYISO offices on Washington Avenue
Extension in Albany to finalize our recommendation(s) to Management
Committee.  (If we can achieve this on May 22, this meeting will not be
needed.  I've been at this too long, however, to expect that will be the
case.)  Again, in person attendance is preferred, however, the following
call-in number will be available.  Same number as the first meeting:

Dial In Number:          (505) 242-2420

Participant Code:   265727

Subject: New Options Model

Meeting on May 30 at 3:30pm regarding the new Option Model we (Steve Wang, 
Harry Arora, and Rob Stalford) use to make markets.  The old structuring 
model was created for marketer to give indicative pricing.  I have created 
this model especially for option market making.  As market makers we found 
the old model too slow as we are often making bid/offers in more than five 
strikes in more than five different months.  This model allows us to make our 
markets quicker and identify mispricings in the market before our 
competitors.  This is not to replace the old structuring model.  It is only a 
complement that will give everyone a better picture of where options are 
trading and where bid/offers are.  We will publish these prices weekly and 
will eventually have them on a daily basis.

You will need special permission to access the files located in 
M:\power2\Options.  Let me know if you want access to this folder.  The

CB Working Group,

Attached is the memo that was requested during last week's conference call.
As an aside, we still need to come up with a new and more accurate name for

Please contact me if you have any questions, otherwise I will speak with you

Regards,

David

Alert Posted: 1:50 PM November 18, 2000 (REVISED) Demand Mismatch Order Notice
Effective Monday, November 20, 2000 at 10:00 a.m., and until further notice, 
AGLC is issuing a demand mismatch order for the following primary pools. This 
notice is revised to include the Ex- Atlanta Group.
ATLANTA, EX-ATLANTA,  MACON, AUGUSTA , and ROME
Based on the current supply levels and expected demand levels, AGLC's system 
cannot manage the potential excess demand and the operational integrity of 
the system will be threatened. Therefore, it is essential that your 
interruptible customer's demand does not exceed the scheduled supply for your 
interruptible market for each primary pool under the demand mismatch order.
Each shipper/pooler/marketer is responsible for contacting their 
interruptible customers to curtail demand if necessary to meet this order. 
Marketers/Poolers are responsible for maintaining interruptible customer 
contact information. Any customer contact information in GOS is for AGLC 
internal use and is not intended to be marketers/poolers point of contact for 
curtailments.

Hi Larry,

We haven't heard from you for a while and wanted to check back with you.  
Have you made a purchase yet?  If so, we would appreciate a reply to this 
message telling us you have already purchased so we will know not to send any 
more follow up messages.

If you are still shopping, is there anything we can do to help you with your 
buying decision?  Our goal is to help you make an informed decision that you 
will be happy with for years to come.  Remember, since we don't own these 
stones, we are your personal diamonds consultants who will work to find the 
very best diamond for you at a great price.

If you have any questions about diamonds or the diamond buying process please 
give Anne or me a call at the toll free number below or email us.  We take 
calls until about 9:00 p.m. EST since we are dealing with customers and 
suppliers on the West Coast.  We find that serious diamond buyers always want 
to call and visit with us so that we can better understand your needs and 
answer any of your questions.  Email works great for shopping, but the 
telephone is the better way to conduct business for such an important 
purchase.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon!

T.J. Please forward to the group.  Thanks.



Please join me in welcoming Susan Scott.  Susan will be assisting East Power 
as a regulatory attorney.  Her phone is 30596.  She is currently sitting near 
the fundamentals group, but will be spending time near me by the real time 
desk learning the "ropes."

The first quarter of 2001 was a record quarter for the performance of the=

Hi Larry,

We are sending this quick note to our diamond customers who are still 
shopping to let you know that the holiday rush has begun.  If you are hoping 
to present your special gift before Christmas, be aware that while we can get 
diamonds in quickly the calendar is getting short for getting a custom 
mounting made.  In another week it will become difficult to get diamonds 
quickly set in mounting.  What normally takes 2-3 days suddenly turns into a 
week long process as the setters are buried with ring sizing, diamond setting 
and other jewelry preparation for the big gift giving days.

If you are planning on presenting your gift after Christmas, you'll have 
plenty of time but the supply of diamonds is as good now as it will be until 
early February.  Unlike cars, TV sets and computers that come down in price 
when the snow falls or following Christmas, we have yet to see diamond prices 
fall.  They tend to keep going up year after year which is good if you own 
them, but a challenge if you are waiting to buy.

If you have any questions about diamonds or the diamond buying process please 
give Anne or me a call at the toll free number below or email us.  We take 
calls until about 9:00 p.m. EST (Mon-Sat) since we are dealing with customers 
and suppliers on the West Coast.  We find that serious diamond buyers always 
want to call and visit with us so that we can better understand your needs 
and answer any of your questions.  Email works great for shopping, but the 
telephone is the better way to conduct business for such an important 
purchase.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon!

Attached is an additional motion to support the Stage 2 ICAP proposed
Tariff, which is Agenda Item 5B for the May 24 BIC meeting.

As you may know, the translation of the In-City price cap from ICAP to UCAP
is a pending item from the proposed ICAP Manual. The ICAP Working Group
concluded at its last meeting that, if the parties could not agree upon a
translation number, the matter should be taken to FERC for a decision.

FERC Staff has agreed that FERC will take up the issue if no consensus is
reached. Alternative positions on the translation issue will be laid out in
the cover letter to the Tariff filing; comments from any party interested in
filing on the translation issue would be due ten business days after the ISO
files the proposed Tariff. The attached motion seeks approval for this
approach.

The ICAPWG may withdraw the motion if consensus is reached before the BIC
meeting.

If you have any questions, please contact Howard Fromer, chair of the
ICAPWG, or me.

The BS&P Subcommittee is scheduled to meet Monday, May 21, 2001 starting at
9:30 a.m. in conference room "WA" at the NYISO offices on Washington Ave.
in Albany.  A conference call number has also been set up as follows:

(601) 354-1086  Participant Code 616484

Our agenda will be as follows:

1.  Review Management Committee meeting of May 10, 2001 regarding the
proposed budget revision and action by the NYISO Board.

2.  Meet with Chuck King and review the details of the Market Services
Budget for 2001 and expectations for 2002.  We will also take advantage of
this opportunity to meet with Chuck to help us develop better 2002 goals
for customer service responsiveness.

3.  Review the comments received from market participants on the draft
goals we sent out to the tie list, and finalize a list of goals to serve as
input to the NYISO internal business planning process.



The BS&P Subcommittee is also scheduled to meet Tuesday, May 22, 2001
starting at 9:30 a.m. in conference room "WA" at the NYISO offices on
Washington Ave. in Albany.  A conference call number has also been set up
as follows:

(505) 242-2420  participant code 265727

As described in a previous e-mail, the purpose of this meeting is to review
the progress of the Credit Policy Working Group (CPWG) in developing a
comprehensive proposal to take to the Management Committee.  Based on
discussions of the CPWG this week, it does not appear a consensus proposal
to the BS&P will be achievable for this meeting, however, the CPWG, Andy
Ragogna, and I believe a detailed presentation to the full BS&P by NYISO
staff of the work accomplished to date, identification of open issues, and
a discussion of how to proceed is appropriate at this time given the
complexity of this issue.  In-person attendance at this meeting is
encouraged.

"Mark Younger" <mdy@slater-consulting.com> writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE 
Discussion List:

Your discussion is based on a misunderstanding.  The $150 price is the
lowest point at which the AMP will check for whether there needs to be any
mitigation.  This price was picked to avoid the AMP running when it is
highly unlikely that any mitigation will in fact be needed.

The $150 price will not trigger mitigation in and of its.  Whenever one of
the zones has a price that is above $150 the AMP will run to determine if
any units have crossed the conduct threshold.  If there are any units that
have crossed the conduct threshold then those units will be set at their
reference bids and the market will be rerun to determine if the impact
threshold has been triggered.  If the impact threshold is triggered in any
zone then the final runs will be done with the mitigated (i.e. reference)
bids for those units that triggered the conduct threshold.  If the impact
threshold is not triggered then the original bids for all units will be
used.

"Kirkpatrick, Joe" <joe.kirkpatrick@nrgenergy.com> writes to the
NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

The NYISO has chosen $150 as representative of a level to trigger market
mitigation. I believe the basis for this was a determination of a price
that was calculated to be representative of the statewide price of $50.
A 300% increase or an increase of $100 is $150, coincidently the same
price.

I am questioning the determination of this price ($50) and its
application in the market mitigation plan.

In determining market power according to the market mitigation plan
specific generator or unit bids are examined to identify economic
withholding. How does the $50 price reference a specific unit, I am not
sure where in the Market Mitigation Plan it says to examine the entire
statewide price and then compare it to a generator's bid.

If a generator's fuel costs (without fixed cost recovery) is $150 that
unit would presumably never bid below its cost, it would always bid as a
minimum $150. How could that generator exceed the thresholds identified
in the market mitigation plan. A 300% increase would be $450 and an
increase of $100 would be $250, and yet using the AMP interpretation of
the mitigation plan the threshold for identifying economic withholding
is $150.
It would seem that the AMP methodology is improperly applying the Market
Mitigation Plan. The Mitigation Plan is supposed to identify generator
conduct and clearly in the application of the AMP it is not.

The simple question would be is the $150 threshold representative of
every generator's bid to determine economic withholding. The answer can
only be no, how can it be?

The Market Mitigation Plan was intended to determine whether a generator
was exercising market power. The determination of whether a generator
was exercising market power would and should take into consideration all
of the prevalent market, unit and system conditions to determine if that
unit was in fact exercising market power. The more complex the system
the more complex the analysis of whether marker power was exercised.

How does a price trigger (or any automatic threshold) take all of the
complexities of a situation into account? It cannot, I suspect that is
why due process is required whether it is a court case or a market power
determination. The full facts are presented and evaluated, every case is
unique and requires deliberation and analysis of every supporting fact.
In other words automatic judgement is not an option and yet under the
NYISO AMP it is offered as a solution.


I do agree that prices should not be posted in the DAM if they are high
as a result of market power. A better solution would be to delay the
prices or hold them in reserve until a proper determination is made. In
the same way that prices are held in reserve for software flaws they
should be held in reserve for determination of market power. Prices can
be posted and flagged subject to change pending review of market power,
at least then due process can be followed. Market participants can be
consulted in accordance with the Plan and if required SCUC can be rerun.

External proxy bus prices may need to be frozen to ensure that flows are
consistent with the orginal DAM posting if a longer period of time is
required for market power evaluation. The AMP is still in place but is
only used to identify potential market power until a "human" evaluation
is done.

 As a follow-up to the recent Enron Corp. memorandum forming Enron Wholesale 
Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services 
Legal Department.

 The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the 
legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed 
the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve 
greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

 To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will 
include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor, 
Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron 
Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, Enron Global Assets.

 The organization chart for the EWS Legal Department is attached.  More 
comprehensive organization charts will follow for each group.

In addition to adjustments to billing units due to the receipt of billing
quality
metering data, this settlement adjustment includes the following billing code
modifications/corrections:

   Billing code was modified to model scheduling & dispatch of grouped
   generators
   for settlement of energy & bid production cost guarantee payments.
   Generators
   affected by this modification should see proper payment of those 
quantities.
   Any
   costs incurred by the NYISO will be recovered from transmission customers
   through
   their OATT Schedule 1 residual & BPCG adjustments
   For the December settlement adjustment, billing code was modified to ensure
   that
   appropriate prices corrections resulting from ECA-B were captured in the
   billing.
   This may impact transmission customers whose transactions were subject to
   ECA-B
   treatment, resulting in transmission usage charge adjustments.  Any costs
   incurred
   by the NYISO will be recovered from transmission customers through their 
OATT
   Schedule 1 residual adjustment.
   For the December settlement adjustment, a number of grandfathered rights &
   TCC
   configurations were corrected.  Customers affected by this would see either
   their
   TCC's converted back to grandfathered rights, or vice versa.  Any excess or
   deficiency
   in cost recovery will be balanced with the Transmission Owners, based upon
   their
   respective megawatt-mile coefficients.
   There was a code modification to allow for Class 2 PURPA generators to sell
   all
   over-generation to the real-time market.  This would result in payment to
   those
   affected suppliers.    Any costs incurred by the NYISO will be recovered 
from
   transmission customers through their OATT Schedule 1 residual adjustment.

Dear Market Participants:

There will be a short disruption to the telephones at the NYISO
due to the conversion to a new telephone system tonight.  The
Customer Relations Helpdesk and critical Operations lines will
be the last ones disconnected and the first ones reconnected.
We anticipate the outage for these lines will be short.

If you cannot get through, please try again in 10 - 15 minutes
or you can send an email to market_relations@nyiso and we will
use one of our back-up cell phones to contact you.

Our apologies for the inconvenience but it is unavoidable as
we switch to the improved telephone system.


Regards,

Customer Relations, NYISO

Subject: Removing impediments to electric generation in western states - w 
hat's in it for the pipelines


Attached is a Word  version of the FERC EL01-47 order, Removing Impediments 
to Electic  Generation  in the Western US.  The order  was issued May  16.  
The order:
 
         (1) Temporarily waives  blanket certificate regulations toincrease 
the dollar  limitations for natural gasfacilities under automatic 
authorization to  $10 million 
        and for prior notice authorizations to $30 million for  all pipelines 
that deliver gas in the WSCC http://www.wscc.com/;
        
        (2)  Temporarily waives blanket certificate regulations to allow 
construction of  mainline facilities, including temporary compression and 
facilities  that alter         mainline  capacity;
 
        (3)Allows  pipelines to roll-in costs costs of facilities constructed 
under  waived blanket certificate regulations until April 30,  2002..
 
The FERC did NOT find it  appropriate to provide a greater rate of return for 
pipelines into the western  US.  The FERC stated that the demand in the 
Western US market is an  adequate rate incentive for the short term.  In 
addition, there are other  rate incentives, according to FERC, albeit more of 
a long-term nature, in  esistence and at the disposal of the pipelines that 
deliver gas in the  WSCC.  Pipelines have the right to propose market-based 
or negotiated  rates.  Pipelines can propose incentive rates.  In addition, 
pipelines  can design incremental rates for projects which propose rates of 
return and  depreciaiton rates that differ from those used on a system wide  
basis.
 
The areas of interest to  the pipeline industry are highlighted on pp. 29-38 
of the attached  order.

On May 24, 2001 the Business Issues Committee will consider proposed Stage
2 modifications to the NYISO Market Administration and Control Area
Services Tariff, including changes to reflect a conversion from ICAP to
UCAP, and from a six-month to a one-month Obligation Procurement Period.
The Department of Public Service offers the attached comments on the
proposal and on the need for a "hard look" at ICAP rules, in general.

hey Larry,
?
What's the name of the junkyard?where you sold  Megan's car?? I'm thinking 
about selling Grace's car (96 Nissan 200SX SE  2dr) to the junkyard b/c it 
was hit by someone else and I don't think it's worth  repairing.
?

TOP 10 WAYS TO BE THE FUNNIEST GUY IN YOUR OFFICE

10. Keep telling the same person they have bad breath
      even if they don't, and then punch them in the face.

  9. Announce in a meeting that you have AIDS. After
      everyone gives you the sympathy remarks, tell everyone
      you were kidding and call them a bunch of queers.

  8. Before a meeting, fill your mouth with custard. In the
     meeting pretend you're hocking up a loogie, spit it into
      a glass and hand it to the person next to you and say
      "BEAT THAT!"

  7. Inform a male co-worker that he would make a good
      hooker, then piss in his coffee and tell him he needs a
      good ass fucking.

   6. Always walk around with a big smile and keep one hand
       down the front of your pants.

   5. Answer every question with " Fucked if I know...",
       then call the person a racial slur that doesn't even match
       their race

   4. Brag about the fact that you carry a gun, and keep
       playing with your nuts. Get them really sweaty and go
       around shaking everyone's hand.

    3. Run down the hall with your dick out spraying piss
        everywhere yelling "It wont stop! God help me it wont
        stop!" Then when it does, look down and say, "Oh! I must have
        broke it."

     2. Ask to borrow a co-worker's expensive pen- Bring it
         to the bathroom and stick it up your ass- return it to
         the person and tell them that it smells bad and tell them to
         smell it- when they say that it smells, say "It should - - I
had it up
         my ass!"

     1. Shit on your office floor and when someone comes in
         and sees it tell them it's the fake rubber kind. When they try
         to pick it up and realize that their hand is full of real shit
- - laugh
         and embarrass him in front of everyone.

Aaron Breidenbaugh <aaron@global2000.net> writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE 
Discussion List:

Sorry about that.

Those who know me, know that the missing zero in my previous email was
probably a Freudian "wishful thinking" slip. FERC of course approved the
continuation of the existing $1000 (not $100) bid cap.

A question for the ISO and Penalty/Disclosure proponents: given the
close linkage between the AMP and the Penalties proposal now being
appealed to the Board, is the MC going to have to revisit the Penalties
motion as well? If so, will the two proposals stay separate or go up to
the MC and Board as a package?

Solar is having problems tracking the information down.  It appears that the 
turbine was manufactured after 1977 (1989) and is subject to subpart GG, but 
I do not have confirmation of this information yet.  This turbine was 
installed at Keystone in 2000.  Did we do all the notifications and testing 
required by GG?  Do you know when the first turbine subject to GG was 
installed at Keystone?  We should be very careful about exchanging turbines 
that are not subject to GG.  We should try to get Solar to exchange pre 1977 
turbines with pre 1977 turbines.

Ms. Jensen,

The turbine power section serial #0921-97-P was installed at Keystone.  It
appears to be a 1997 model but can you confirm this through your Solar

Hi Larry,

finance function at a manager level and some of the general responsibilities
include interest and foreign exchange risk management, long-term cash

The list I have is years old.  Fortunately, the names in Deal Entry and Deal 
Blotter are alphabetical so you do not need to know the codes.  The power 
short codes are not consistent with the NERC codes so this would probably not 
help you.  Attached is a list of CPs with whom we deal.

April 20, 2001

To Market Participants:

On April 24, 2001, the NYISO will premier its

? new website design. The visual
presentation of the site is
being refreshed to convey a bold presence on the Internet and present a clear,
consistent, hi-tech look and
feel to the site. This represents the completion of phase I of the web refresh
project and is part of the
NYISO Strategic Initiatives.

For a period of two weeks (until May 8, 2001), both the new and old websites
will be operated in parallel.
On May 8, 2001 (unless notified differently), the old site will be 
discontinued.
The NYISO has planned
the transition to be as seamless as possible for our Market Participants and
Guests.

Several paths are available to access the new site. Direct links will be 
placed
on the NYISO home page
and on the What?s New page under Hot Topics. PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE BOOKMARKS OR
SCRIPT FILES!!!!!!!!!!!! Once the transition period is ended, the NYISO will
rename the server
containing the new website to the address of the old website. With this plan,
Users will NOT be required
to modify bookmarks and/or script files.

The URL addresses for the MIS portion of the web site, the billing statements,
and the LBMP data HAVE
NOT and WILL NOT change. Access to these areas of the site will not change and
Users will not need to
modify any procedures.

What Users can expect to see is consistent fonts, style rules, symbols, 
colors,
etc. This will enhance
navigation and improve the functionality of the site. Phase II of this project
will address site architecture,
file structure, and make substantial improvements to site navigation and data
content. Information
gathered from onsite interviews with Market Participants from each sector will
be used in the
implementation of Phase II changes.

Market Participants should contact their Customer Relations Representative if
they have any questions,
comments, concerns, and/or problems. All others may contact Customer Relations
at (518) 356-6060.

Thank You
The Web Refresh Team

In an effort to protect Enron's e-mail system from harmful viruses, the 
Global Messaging Team has implemented an inbound and outbound cluster of 
MAILSweeper servers. What does that mean to you, the user? All inbound and 
outbound Internet mail is passed through a set of servers that will scan each 
message for viruses, malicious code, business related-content and 
inappropriate content. Inbound Internet mail that contains the following 
attachment types will be quarantined (held for delivery): *.vbs, *.exe, 
*.com, *.bat, *.cmd. If you are the intended recipient of one of these 
e-mails, you will receive an automatic notification with instructions on how 
to get your legitimate e-mail released from quarantine.

We have taken these measures to protect our e-mail environment from harmful 
e-mail viruses. We believe that these protections will result in less down 
time for your e-mail, in the event that Enron gets hit with a virus or 
malicious code.

barkerde@nmenergy.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:



Ray,
What if you want your transaction to be cut if the economics support it? You
change your DAM ( or leave it at the original bid) to a price sensitive bid 
and
the BME promises you that price you wanted in your bid, then SCD runs and the
real time (no constraints thus no BME clearing) runs up due operational
restrictions and the price you get clobbers you? Like it did before the $20 K
adder. All these problems would go away if the BME clearing at the Proxy
busses,passed by BIC and MC ,was implemented. Baby-sitting your DAM bids would
solve the " schedule and forget deal" but if you have any arb or price 
sensitive
schedules then you run into the risk above.  Given the apparent limitations of
the NYISO (software ?) we might have to pick and choose which band aid 
approach
is more palatable.

NewPower to offer another pilot program to Houston employees


Free remote energy management solution helps you to manage rising energy 
bills.
NewPower is launching a revolutionary technology pilot to the first 500 
people to sign up in the Houston area.  The NewPower Connections Remote 
Energy Management Solution is a pilot program designed to give consumers 
control of their thermostat via the Internet.  The program will allow 
thermostats to be adjusted from anywhere, with any Internet-enabled device, 
including computers, web-enabled cell phones, palm OS devices, or pocket 
PCs.  Sears Home Central will install and service the Remote Energy 
Management Solution at no charge throughout the duration of the pilot 
program.  For a typical household, the three-month pilot could result in up 
to 10 percent to 15 percent utility bill savings, based on personal usage and 
the size of your home.  


Be among the first to participate absolutely free.
Enrollment with the NewPower Connections Remote Energy Management Solution 
pilot program starts May 14 and continues through the end of the month.  For 
more information about this offer, visit NewPower's table located in the 
Plaza of the Enron Building near the down escalator from 11:00 a.m. to 2 p.m. 
during the week of May 14.  To become a pilot participant you need only to be 
a homeowner in the Houston area and have Internet access.  You do not even 
have to be a NewPower electricity customer to participate.  For more 
information about NewPower Connections, send an e-mail to 
connections@newpower.com.

rbowers@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

On April 24, 2001, the NYISO deployed code changes affecting Class 1 PURPA
transactions in the billing system and modified bid status flagging in the 
MIS.
These changes impacted settlements for 4/10, 4/11, 4/13, and 4/18 - forward.

There was a code design problem with the PURPA code change that resulted in an
error in the computation of balancing energy for some class 1 units that
resulted in their purchasing their entire day-ahead schedules in the balancing
market.  There was also an oversight in the implementation of the modified bid
status flagging in the MIS such that those bids were not transferred into the
billing system, impacting bid production cost guarantee settlements for the
units with a modified bid status.

The NYISO will be issuing a supplemental invoice for April 2001 settlements on
Tuesday, May 15th to adjust for the aforementioned issues.  Funds due the 
NYISO
for this supplemental invoice should be transferred into the NYISO Clearing
Account by close of business Wednesday, May 23, 2001.  Funds due Market
Participants from the NYISO for this supplemental invoice will be transferred
into Market Participant accounts by close of business Friday, May 25, 2001.

PLEASE NOTE THAT: Funds due the NYISO for the April 2001 settlements which 
were
invoiced on May 7, 2001 should be transferred into the NYISO Clearing Account 
by
close of business Wednesday, May 16, 2001, as scheduled.  Funds due Market
Participants from the NYISO for the April 2001 settlements invoiced on May 7,
2001 will be transferred into Market Participant accounts by close of business
Monday, May 21, 2001, as scheduled.

Houston Ballet gives free performances of Copp,lia
at Miller Outdoor Theatre in Hermann Park
8:00 p.m. Friday May 11, Saturday May 12, & Sunday May 13, 2001 
sponsored by AZURIX and ENRON

Considered the great comedy of classical ballet, Copp,lia  tells the story of 
a doll so enchantingly lifelike that she mesmerizes an entire village, 
captures the heart of a young swain named Franz and inspires the eccentric 
toymaker Dr. Copp,lius to attempt to transform her into a living, breathing 
human being. 

AZURIX and ENRON are Corporate Sponsors for Houston Ballet's Miller Theatre 
performances, helping to present these free performances of Copp,lia to the 
people of Houston.  Houston Ballet has a limited number of tickets for the 
seated area each night for employees of AZURIX and ENRON.  These tickets are 
available on a first-come, first-served basis by calling William at 
713-535-3235 no later than 5 PM today .  (Please be aware that all unoccupied 
seats are released at 10 minutes before curtain.)

Other, free, general public tickets for the seated area (max 4 per person) 
are available at the Miller Theatre 11:30 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. on the day of 
performance; for more information call 713-284-8351 for the Miller Theatre 
ticket information line.  Tickets are not required for the lawn area.  

About Coppelia
Copp,lia was first performed on May 25, 1870 at the Th,atre Imp,rial de 
L'Op,ra, featuring choreography by Arthur Saint-L,on and music by L,o 
Delibes. The work maintains a special place in the history of dance, serving 
as a kind of bridge from the glory of the French Romantic ballet in the early 
nineteenth century to the masterpieces of the Russian Imperial Theater at the 
turn of the century. Writing in The International Dictionary of Ballet, 
critic Karen Dacko analyzes the unique characteristics of the piece as 
follows: "Copp,lia owes its longevity to its inspired, very danceable score. 
But the ballet is also remarkable for its perennial appeal and for its 
historical significance as Romanticism's grand finale and classical ballet's 
prologue."
Copp,lia first entered Houston Ballet' repertoire in October 1974, in a 
staging by Frederic Franklin (who also performed the role of Dr. Copp,lius), 
and featuring scenery by Peter Farmer. In November 1979, former Royal Ballet 
ballerina Anne Heaton re-staged the work for the company. When Houston Ballet 
premiered its new production of the work in March 1992 featuring breathtaking 
d,cor by Desmond Heeley, Carl Cunningham of The Houston Post wrote, "It would 
be hard to imagine anything to cap the joyous, gentle, and glorious looking 
new production of Copp,lia the splendidly prepared company of dancers and 
musicians put forth Thursday evening on Wortham Center's Brown Theater 
stage."    (The Houston Post, March 21, 1992)
Heeley's designs for Copp,lia never fail to enchant, most notably in the 
second-act depiction of Dr. Copp,lius's workshop. The sampling of dolls on 
display pay homage to the era when automatons, or mechanical toys, were the 
rage in Europe -- and to Heeley's inexhaustible creativity. Among the 
eye-popping toys featured in  the workshop are a huge astrologer with a 
pointed hat and a robe covered in shooting stars and moons; a strongman with 
a handlebar mustache and barbells; Puss n Boots; an acrobat hanging from a 
trapeze holding the man in the moon; and a small ballerina dancing on the 
back of a goat. In the first act, the vibrant reds, golds, and oranges of the 
costumes worn by the peasants in the village conjure up a wonderfully 
picturesque vision of nineteenth century Bavaria.

The Enron stock price has been pretty cruel.
I hope you and the others did not get hurt to bad.
If I had not left I would have been there with you
guys from now on.
How is Butch doing?
I have not had a report on him in some time.
Keep your chin up and do make contact from time to
time.

Dear Amazon Music Customer,

As someone who's bought music gifts from us in the past, you might
like to know about our box sets special. From now until December 18,
every box set in our Music store (that's thousands of them) will be
on sale at prices up to 30% off the list price.

Box sets make a great gift for music lovers, but with so many titles
to choose from, it isn't easy to know what to buy. That's where we can
help. To help you sift through the many choices, we've created a list
of our most popular box sets. Featuring artists like The Eagles, Elton
John, Jimi Hendrix, Bob Marley, Miles Davis, and others, it's a pretty
impressive list--and, at up to 30% off, the prices can't be beat. To
view our top boxes, follow the link below:

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/feature/-/125730/

If you don't find what you're looking for on this list, don't worry.
We've got an entire Box Sets Store packed with thousands of box sets
in every style of music. (If you come across a box set you just have
to have for yourself, we won't tell.) To check out our Box Sets
Store, follow the link below:

http://www.amazon.com/boxset/

Hope you take advantage of our box sets special (remember, it only
lasts until December 18).

Happy holidays,

Andy Bartlett
Senior Editor, Music

We will be releasing new version of the Stack Manager and the EnronOnline=
=20
website tonight . The following are the changes

1. Changes to Stack Manager:

1.1 Changes to toolbar icons:
To facilitate further development of the system, it has been found necessar=
y=20
to change the toolbar icons at the top of the Stack  Manager. The attached=
=20
file shows the old icon and its new replacement. Next to each image below i=
s=20
the description of the function that is executed as well as the short cut k=
ey=20
that is mapped to the same function:



1.2 New Functionality - Auto Suspend
The Auto Suspend function allows traders to set an absolute price change fr=
om=20
a price level at which you would like the system to automatically suspend a=
=20
specific product. This function is useful if your products use automatic=20
price resets.

To activate this feature:
1. Select a product and click on Product Properties
2. Check the Enable box
3. Enter the Price Check and Suspend at +/- values
4. Click Update
Example: a trader Enables Auto Suspend and selects a $35.00 Price Check and=
 a=20
suspension level of +/- $5.00: The system will suspend the product when the=
=20
mid price is above  $40.00 or below $30.00

You will need to enter a new Price Check or disable the Auto Suspend functi=
on=20
to reactivate this Product if the Auto Suspend is triggered. =20
Please note the system checks for any products that need to be suspended on=
ce=20
a minute.


2. Changes to EnronOnline Website
 (These changes will be rolled out in phases over the next week and will be=
=20
available to all customers only by Friday 5/4/01)

The following enhancements have been made to the EnronOnline Website:

2.1 Today=01,s Transactions

Float Window:  In order to float the window, right click on the Today=01,s=
=20
Transactions section, click on the Float Window option.

Sort Ordering: Click on the column heading to change the sort order.=20

Linked Transactions: You can display the linked Transactions in an expanded=
=20
or collapsed view. To do so, right click in the Transaction display area an=
d=20
select full Expand or Full Collapse.

2.2 Submission Box

The submission box has been modified in order to show a space between each=
=20
set of =01&zeros=018 for the volume the customer wants to sell/buy.

"Kirkpatrick, Joe" <joe.kirkpatrick@nrgenergy.com> writes to the 
NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Mark

Thanks for the clarification, regardless of what triggers mitigation it
is still an automated process that bypasses due process. System, unit
and market conditions are dynamic and therefore the circumstances to
determine market power are dynamic, you would assume that they are
fixed. Reference prices are dynamic based on many of the complexities of
the system. As a simple example I would offer gas basis as a complexity
that is not even taken into consideration.
Gas basis can have the result of increasing costs to a generator by as
an example $20/MMbtu, who at the NYISO is monitoring this on an hourly
basis?

If the most expensive unit on the system is given a reference price of
$150 what would be the highest clearing price you would expect to see
that would be set by an internal generator?

Since the NYISO reference bids for generators involved approximately
zero discussion with generators would you consider that following the
Market Mitigation Plan?

The default reference price for a generator's energy is based on
recently accepted bids for energy from that generator. In the event that
such data are unavailable a default reference price is either(1) by
negotiation with the generator, or (2) by an estimate of cost.

What defines an accepted bid? Is it the dispatch of a generator with
payment being either its bid or the LBMP price at the bus whichever is
higher. This is not clear to me.
What happened to the negotiation part?

In training material provided by the NYISO they clarify that a generator
must include all of its costs in its bid to ensure cost recovery, part
of those costs are fixed cost recovery. None of the default reference
bids assigned by the NYISO include any these costs.


Thanks

Joe

"Mark Younger" <mdy@slater-consulting.com> writes to the
NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Your discussion is based on a misunderstanding.  The $150 price is the
lowest point at which the AMP will check for whether there needs to be
any
mitigation.  This price was picked to avoid the AMP running when it is
highly unlikely that any mitigation will in fact be needed.

The $150 price will not trigger mitigation in and of its.  Whenever one
of
the zones has a price that is above $150 the AMP will run to determine
if
any units have crossed the conduct threshold.  If there are any units
that
have crossed the conduct threshold then those units will be set at their
reference bids and the market will be rerun to determine if the impact
threshold has been triggered.  If the impact threshold is triggered in
any
zone then the final runs will be done with the mitigated (i.e.
reference)
bids for those units that triggered the conduct threshold.  If the
impact
threshold is not triggered then the original bids for all units will be
used.

"Kirkpatrick, Joe" <joe.kirkpatrick@nrgenergy.com> writes to the
NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

The NYISO has chosen $150 as representative of a level to trigger market
mitigation. I believe the basis for this was a determination of a price
that was calculated to be representative of the statewide price of $50.
A 300% increase or an increase of $100 is $150, coincidently the same
price.

I am questioning the determination of this price ($50) and its
application in the market mitigation plan.

In determining market power according to the market mitigation plan
specific generator or unit bids are examined to identify economic
withholding. How does the $50 price reference a specific unit, I am not
sure where in the Market Mitigation Plan it says to examine the entire
statewide price and then compare it to a generator's bid.

If a generator's fuel costs (without fixed cost recovery) is $150 that
unit would presumably never bid below its cost, it would always bid as a
minimum $150. How could that generator exceed the thresholds identified
in the market mitigation plan. A 300% increase would be $450 and an
increase of $100 would be $250, and yet using the AMP interpretation of
the mitigation plan the threshold for identifying economic withholding
is $150.
It would seem that the AMP methodology is improperly applying the Market
Mitigation Plan. The Mitigation Plan is supposed to identify generator
conduct and clearly in the application of the AMP it is not.

The simple question would be is the $150 threshold representative of
every generator's bid to determine economic withholding. The answer can
only be no, how can it be?

The Market Mitigation Plan was intended to determine whether a generator
was exercising market power. The determination of whether a generator
was exercising market power would and should take into consideration all
of the prevalent market, unit and system conditions to determine if that
unit was in fact exercising market power. The more complex the system
the more complex the analysis of whether marker power was exercised.

How does a price trigger (or any automatic threshold) take all of the
complexities of a situation into account? It cannot, I suspect that is
why due process is required whether it is a court case or a market power
determination. The full facts are presented and evaluated, every case is
unique and requires deliberation and analysis of every supporting fact.
In other words automatic judgement is not an option and yet under the
NYISO AMP it is offered as a solution.


I do agree that prices should not be posted in the DAM if they are high
as a result of market power. A better solution would be to delay the
prices or hold them in reserve until a proper determination is made. In
the same way that prices are held in reserve for software flaws they
should be held in reserve for determination of market power. Prices can
be posted and flagged subject to change pending review of market power,
at least then due process can be followed. Market participants can be
consulted in accordance with the Plan and if required SCUC can be rerun.

External proxy bus prices may need to be frozen to ensure that flows are
consistent with the orginal DAM posting if a longer period of time is
required for market power evaluation. The AMP is still in place but is
only used to identify potential market power until a "human" evaluation
is done.

To: NYISO BIC,

Last month I produced a BAWG Status Report presentation for the April 24,
2001 BIC meeting but unfortunately was not able to give that presentation
"in-person" because of a scheduling conflict with a sub-working group
meeting to discuss metering for the EDRP.  This status report is available
on the NYISO Web Site under April 24 BIC Meeting Materials and it is my
understanding that Garry Brown directed market participants to read that
presentation and contact Wes Yeomans or attend a BAWG meeting with
questions.

The last slide in that presentation did require action from the BIC
pertaining to direction on what to use for generation payments when the
NYISO orders a generator on line but the generator bid price expired.
Attached please find the last slide from the April 24, 2001 presentation.
I will be available by conference call on May 24 at 3:00 PM to lead the
discussion on this issue.

Wes Yeomans

Dear Market Participants,

It has been brought to our attention that a mistake was made on the Bid Form 
for
ICAP Auctions.  A corrected version of the Bid Form will be posted to the 
NYISO

Larry:

A couple of comments:

1. I recommend that the 150 MW limit be managed by NYISO Operations.  They
are going to understand the problems in real time and should have complete
authority of which generators get run based on the situation. Trying to
fairly rotate which units get called at this late date, given the hours of
operation are completely unknown would be a waste of time, in my opinion.

2. We all should be very grateful that the DEC has taken the action they
have on expanding the exempt generator definition.  If people are not happy
with the 150MW cap then they should get a registration or state facility
permit and notify the ISO that the their site is not to be counted in the
150 MW cap calculation.

3. Not paying full ICAP for these resources would be a disaster.  If we want
to kill the emergency program, this is the best way to do it.  Again,
calling of generators should be based on the NYISO Operations assessment of
the emergency situation.  A special case resource generator standing ready
to serve, even if DEC has placed some limits on the number of MW running at
one time, should not be penalized by this cap.  We may find situations where
some of the SCR "exempt" generators called can not start or limit their
generation hours for some reason.  In this case we need as many SCR
resources ready to fill the void as possible. Limit payments really hurts
the credibility and effectiveness of the programs we have all worked so hard
to develop.

4. I do not think the EDRP manuals need to say anything on this subject.
This should strictly be an internal NYISO operation matter on which
generators get called in each zone.  If the Operations manual needs to be
updated to reflect the 150 MW exempt generator class of EDRP generators lets
do it here not in the EDRP manual.

Looking forward to Monday's discussion. Have a great weekend.

Subject: 150 mW DEC Cap for "Emergency Exempt" for EDRP

Colleagues,
This is a "heads up" that there are several issues we will need to look at
on Monday with respect to the new NYS DEC expanded definition of "emergency
exempt" when participating in the EDRP.  The problems needing solving that I
am aware of so far concern the 150 mW cap that DEC placed on the ISO's call
for emergency customer generation.  Our understanding is that more than that
amount can be signed up for the program--but only 150 mWs can be called at
any one time.

Some have suggested that the DEC does not have the right or power to
regulate the NYISO.  I don't know.  But I do know that DEC would revoke this
in heart-beat if they thought we were going to ignore it--especially after
all these different parties, including the ISO and the self-generation
developers, bargained with NYS DEC to do what they have done.  Also, the
individual participating customers would be more than some upset if they
found out that DEC was revoking their emergency exempt status because they
were deemed to have been the ones who were over the 150 mW limit in an
emergency call.

There are two problems that I have seen, both related to enrolling more than
150 mWs of emergency exempt EDRP participants.  First, if there is more than
150 mWs in the region being called, we need to determine a method for who
gets called--it could rotate in an equitable fashion.  But our manual should
probably speak to this.

The other problem is that we probably shouldn't be paying full ICAP to 300
mWs of emergency exempt EDRP participants if we know that no more than half
of them can respond to any ICAP call.  We might derate them in percentage to
the subscription over the 150 mWs.  Or some other system.

My purpose here is to alert you to the issue and suggest that we want to
come up with a solution on Monday.  I spoke with Mollie Lampi about it and
hope the ISO has a chance to work on it today.  We want all EDRP and DADRP
manual matters to go before the BIC on May 24th.

Have a great weekend and thanks for all of the creative thinking and
constructive participation on getting these programs as right as we can as
quickly as we can!

150 MW cap calculation.

3. Not paying full ICAP for these resources would be a disaster.  If we want
to kill the emergency program, this is the best way to do it.  Again,
calling of generators should be based on the NYISO Operations assessment of
the emergency situation.  A special case resource generator standing ready
to serve, even if DEC has placed some limits on the number of MW running at
one time, should not be penalized by this cap.  We may find situations where
some of the SCR "exempt" generators called can not start or limit their
generation hours for some reason.  In this case we need as many SCR
resources ready to fill the void as possible. Limit payments really hurts
the credibility and effectiveness of the programs we have all worked so hard
to develop.

4. I do not think the EDRP manuals need to say anything on this subject.
This should strictly be an internal NYISO operation matter on which
generators get called in each zone.  If the Operations manual needs to be
updated to reflect the 150 MW exempt generator class of EDRP generators lets
do it here not in the EDRP manual.

Looking forward to Monday's discussion. Have a great weekend.

Subject:        150 mW DEC Cap for "Emergency Exempt" for EDRP

Colleagues,
This is a "heads up" that there are several issues we will need to look at
on Monday with respect to the new NYS DEC expanded definition of "emergency
exempt" when participating in the EDRP.  The problems needing solving that I
am aware of so far concern the 150 mW cap that DEC placed on the ISO's call
for emergency customer generation.  Our understanding is that more than that
amount can be signed up for the program--but only 150 mWs can be called at
any one time.

Some have suggested that the DEC does not have the right or power to
regulate the NYISO.  I don't know.  But I do know that DEC would revoke this
in heart-beat if they thought we were going to ignore it--especially after
all these different parties, including the ISO and the self-generation
developers, bargained with NYS DEC to do what they have done.  Also, the
individual participating customers would be more than some upset if they
found out that DEC was revoking their emergency exempt status because they
were deemed to have been the ones who were over the 150 mW limit in an
emergency call.

There are two problems that I have seen, both related to enrolling more than
150 mWs of emergency exempt EDRP participants.  First, if there is more than
150 mWs in the region being called, we need to determine a method for who
gets called--it could rotate in an equitable fashion.  But our manual should
probably speak to this.

The other problem is that we probably shouldn't be paying full ICAP to 300
mWs of emergency exempt EDRP participants if we know that no more than half
of them can respond to any ICAP call.  We might derate them in percentage to
the subscription over the 150 mWs.  Or some other system.

My purpose here is to alert you to the issue and suggest that we want to
come up with a solution on Monday.  I spoke with Mollie Lampi about it and
hope the ISO has a chance to work on it today.  We want all EDRP and DADRP
manual matters to go before the BIC on May 24th.

Have a great weekend and thanks for all of the creative thinking and
constructive participation on getting these programs as right as we can as
quickly as we can!

Larry

According to my fancy ciphering we made $310,037.50 for the month of 
November.  This figure does not include Buck o 5's New York p&l.  We made 
&127508.45 moving power incrementally and $62497.05 in NEPOOL and PJM.  Mitch 
made $120,032.00 in his December position that was closed out in the month of 
November.  Great job by everyone.  

On another note Russell Ballato has been accepted into the new ENRON trading 
program that will start in January.  No further details as of yet.  Everyone 
should congratulate and support his efforts.  Way to go Russell  and remember 
the peasants.  We expect you to check in with us on a daily basis.  We expect 
a monthly happy hour at your expense.

Also with the Holidays coming up and the reorganization it is very important 
that we communicate with the utmost importance.  We are all responsible for 
what happens on this desk.  I will be out of town from the 23rd of December 
until the 1st of January.  I will have my mobile with me 713-859-1713, any 
questions please call.  Once again great job in November and let's take 
December by the horns.

Thanks

As a separate item to the concerns I had about the technical content, I was
a little confused on what was done here administratively. The last paragraph
says something about NYPA sharing the study. I didn't think they had
anything at all to say about it in the first place if it is an ISO work
product. If they do, could you explain why this is the case? If the ISO did
this, why wasn't this all posted on the OASIS at the same time NYPA got
this? The date on this shows a March 26 release.  Ignore these comments if
this was done, but I wasn't aware of this.

I am more than a little uncomfortable with a single market participant
having a month's lead time on ISO studies that can have significant
commercial impact. Think about the implications of this in the context of
people negotiating long term bi lateral ICAP agreements over the last month.
Depending on your take on the type of market changes that this type of
analysis might support, there could be enormous changes to the economics of
seasonal versus annual agreements, choice of equipment etc. This simply
isn't fair. Even if posted, this type of work by the ISO that can have large
potential commercial impacts should go out on all of the distributions at
the same time as release to anyone and OASIS posting.

Subject: NYPA study-Winter Locational ICAP requirements

At NYPA's request ISO staff conducted a limited analysis of
the winter locational ICAP requirements for Long Island and New York City
areas.  While such ICAP requirements have historically been set as a single
number for the entire year, it is NYPA's belief that this holdover from the
old way of doing business must be re-examined.  It is NYPA's belief that
most if not all of the contribution to loss of load risk occurs in the
summer months.  As such, some reduction in winter ICAP requirements should
be possible with no impact on the Loss of Load criterion of one day in ten
years.

NYPA requested that the ISO start with the database that
resulted in the locational requirements of 80% and 98% for New York City and
Long Island, respectively.   At NYPA's request the ISO modeled winter
ratings on the transmission interfaces into NYC and LI and determined how
much the 80% and 98% could be reduced in the winter before any impact on the
statewide Loss Of Load  occurred.  The report indicates that winter
requirements of 75% and 92% of the summer peak load resulted for NYC and LI,
respectively.

While this in no way reflects an exhaustive analysis of winter
locational requirements, the results from this study suggest that some
reduction in the winter         requirement may be warranted and a
consideration of seasonal requirements should be incorporated in future ICAP
requirement studies.   NYPA believes that       having an ICAP requirement
for summer and winter seasons based on the LSE's peak load for the
respective season would send the proper ICAP price signal.


NYPA is sharing the study results in the attached report in
an effort to begin a dialog which we hope will lead to a broader examination
of locational requirements when the issue is revisited again next year.  We
would appreciate hearing the views of other market participants.

Discussion List:

Greetings,

Take note of these recent developments.....

http://www.nyiso.com/services/documents/filings/index.html

Note Commissioner Massey's Statement that the first decision effectively
precludes implementation of the AMP for most of the summer period.

Content

On April 4, 2001, we issued a memorandum which included information from
EPA regarding the Agency=01,s current thinking on the draft MACT standards =
for
IC engines and combustion turbines located at major sources of HAP
emissions (see Attachment A of attached file).  Since the distribution of
that memorandum, EPA has provided corrections regarding the compliance
monitoring requirements for the IC Engine MACTs.  The MACT information
provided by EPA, including the latest corrections regarding compliance
monitoring are included in this memorandum.  Clearly, this is preliminary
information and should not be construed as the content of the final rules.
This content could change before these rules are submitted to OMB,
subsequently issued as proposed standards, or promulgated as final rules.

Tired of the 40 X 40 X 40 Plan? You know:

Work 40 hours per week for someone else for 40 years, then receive a 40% 
reduction in pay!

Is working for a "boss" too demeaning and unrewarding?

Are you sick of depending on a job with too little pay and too many hours 
with no personal reward and even less future?

If you're determined to retire in the next 2 - 5 years with enough income to 
have REAL Financial Independence and Freedom, and are not afraid to work for 
it, I can help you.

I am looking for people with a Good Work Ethic and extraordinary Desire to 
Earn at Least $10,000 per Month Working From Home!

NO SPECIAL SKILLS OR EXPERIENCE REQUIRED. We will give you all the training 
and personal support you will need to ensure your success!

This LEGITIMATE HOME-BASED INCOME OPPORTUNITY can put you back in Control of 
your Time, Your Finances, and Your Life!

If you've tried other opportunities in the past that have failed to live up 
to their promises, THIS IS DIFFERENT THAN ANYTHING ELSE YOU'VE SEEN!

THIS IS NOT A GET-RICH-QUICK SCHEME!

YOUR FINANCIAL PAST DOES NOT HAVE TO BE YOUR FINANCIAL FUTURE!

CALL ONLY IF YOU ARE SERIOUS!

While it would benefit the organization for me to go on this trip,  I don't 
think it is wise to participate given the current project load.

Thanks, Bill

Sarita, were all set for rooms and meals.  The itinerary is as follows.  
John, Bill and Randy will fly into Flagstaff, sometime in the PM of Monday, 
June 18th.  Rich, Tiny and or  I will either pick them up at the airport or 
there is shuttle service to Little America, the hotel in Flagstaff for the 2 
night stay.  We plan on visiting stations 3 and 4 on Tuesday.  Then 1 and 2 
on Wednesday.  I dont think that we will need rental cars as Rich, Tiny and I 
will have our company cars.  John had indicated that he needed to make a 
Thursday meeting in Houston, so I only made reservations at Little America 
for Monday and Tuesday night.  Should Randy and or Bill decide to stay over 
on Thursday, we can make reservations for Wednesday also.  Let me know.   I m 
not sure what Louie is doing, he had stated that he would take care of his 
accomodations should he decide to make the trip.   Ive  got business at 
Stations 1 and 2 on Thursday and Friday, so Ill be there the whole week.  As 
for Tiny, Im sure he will be carrying Rich's luggage any where Rich needs to 
go...... Sarita, what else?

Dear Larry Campbell,

Welcome to edition 3.7 of Investors Insite--an editorial 
co-production of Datek Online and The Motley Fool. 

The long-awaited news in this edition is Datek Online's introduction 
of option trades for qualified customers. Backed by an easy-to-grasp 
online trading system and real-time option price chains, Datek 
Online's commission is $9.99 per online option trade plus $1.75 per 
contract. Compare that price to the commissions charged by other 
brokerages. If you've decided that options may be an appropriate part 
of reaching your financial goals, apply now to trade options at 
Datek Online.* 

Wonder how quickly stock markets are making the move to fully 
decimalized trading? Links to an Insite follow-up article identifies 
the more than 100 stocks listed on the New York and American Stock 
Exchanges that became eligible for decimalized trading on September 
25, 2000. Qualified investors can now make decimalized equity and 
option trades of these stocks at Datek Online. 

A provocative article from Motley Fool shows how a Bear Market might 
just be the ticket to that level playing field you've been dreaming 
of. Want to learn about books that some people actually have time to 
read? Check out the Motley Fool's reviews of Peter Bernstein's 
Against the Gods: The Remarkable Story of Risk and Robert Shiller's 
Irrational Exuberance. And if you've got the urge to dust off your 
thinking cap, this month's installment of Motley Trivia offers three 
tough-but-fair corporate ID challenges. 

And be sure to check out the next generation of Streamerc. A free
download from Datek Online can put the newly expanded capabilities of 
this real-time quote system right on your desktop. 

Thanks for joining us again. Please read on!

ARE BEAR MARKETS GREAT NEWS? 
Most people don't think so. But the pros at Motley Fool point out 
that a bearish dip in prices can make stocks more affordable for the 
average investor. If you missed the boat on the bulls, or want to go 
back for affordable seconds then, ironically enough, a downturn in 
your future might be something to cheer about. more>>

ENW is already static routing 10.0.0.0/8 to EBS and EBS is static routing 
172.16.0.0/12 and 192.168.0.0/16 to ENW, the impact should be nil.
Backout: Remove eigrp process 5 from iah-ecn44-rtr3.enron.net

Chat with the Producer of Mechcommander 2
FASA's five-star general of game development, Mitch Gitelman, will field your 
questions May 31 in the Zone Theater chat room. With the sequel to the 
groundshaking Mechcommander RTS less than a month away from going gold, we're 
sure the conversation will be lively, especially when Mitch gets going on 
"spanking." As Mitch says, it's a topic "for mature readers, so don't show it 
to the reporter for Highlights magazine."

Dear Market Participants,

On Saturday May 12, 2001, the NYISO experienced higher than
normal LBMP's in real-time operation for those zones east of the
Central-East interface.
A scheduled maintenance outage of the Edic-New Scotland 345kV
transmission facility, in addition to unanticipated generating
resource outages, resulted in higher than normal congestion
associated with the Central-East interface.

Subject:  PJM Announces CSS Training Program



Message sent from the pjm-customer-info mailing list at
pjm-customer-info@majordomo.pjm.com:

On June 12, PJM will implement the Collaborative Scheduling System (CSS), a 
new
scheduling tool designed to facilitate transaction schedules between New York
and PJM.
CSS will become part of the EES tool now used to schedule transactions from 
and
to PJM neighbors.

PJM will offer several two-hour "virtual" workshops to introduce the new 
system.
Participants who now use EES and will use CSS are encouraged to attend one of
these workshops.  The dates for the workshops are: May 31 at 10:00 a.m., June 
5
at 2:00 p.m. or June 11 at 2:00 p.m. The workshops will be presented on the
internet with audio teleconference.

A complete description of the new tool, the training program, and a 
registration
form for the program are available on the PJM web site at
http://www.pjm.com/training/css/css.html

"Mark Younger" <mdy@slater-consulting.com> writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE 
Discussion List:

The 150 MW limitation on ICAP eligibility should only apply to SCR resources
that would fall within the DEC cap.  Any SCR resource that is exempt should
not be limited in its ability to sell ICAP (I never meant to imply they
should).

As to whether the cap is enforceable or whether the NYISO will comply, it
seems the fastest way to have the exemption yanked is for the NYISO to not
comply with the DEC's wishes.

We can talk about this at the PRL meeting on Monday but ultimately this is
an issue for ICAP working group and possibly the NYSRC.

Subject: Re: 150 mW DEC Cap for "Emergency Exempt" for EDRP

We can flesh this discussion out next week, but from the outset, Mark's
and Roy's comments are overly simplistic and overly restrictive.

First of all, not all SCR resources are impacted by the DEC cap. Many
will now be forced to go the route of obtaining Registration or State
Facility status, either of which allows then to operate above the 150 MW
cap. Lacking any DEC-imposed limit, all such permitted facilities must
be allowed to sign up for full SCR value. Obviously, other SCR
resources, not tied to emergency generation are also unaffected and
cannot be limited.

Even with respect to the Centrally Dispatched Emergency Power Generating
Units (CDEPGs), as John Prunkl points out, it is ISO Operations staff
that will need to decide on a real-time basis which SCR units should be
called. Due to the locational nature of the EDRP calls, a unit called
one day, may or may not be needed the next. Only in the case where there
will always be a clear overlap should any consideration be given to
precluding an SCR resource from participating and even then, as with
generators, there is no guarantee that all SCR-certified units will be
there when called upon.

The proper approach is not to limit who can sign up for SCR, but to
decide what protocols will be used to allocate activations during
emergencies. SCR resources that get signed up, but cannot be called due
to the limit would be analogous to generating units that sell ICAP, but
cannot operate when needed due to air permit or manufacturer warrantee
limitations. I think this would mean a UCAP "hit" for future sales.

As a more fundamental matter, I do not believe that DEC's ill-advised
150 MW limit (which was not agreed to by the NYISO) is currently
enforceable as a practical matter.

Only the NYISO knows when the 150 MW cap is being approached and
therefore the ISO's failure to adhere to that limit should not be held
against the affected generators. Nevertheless, the DEC ruling appears to
revoke the CDEPG status of ALL emergency generators upon a finding that
the NYISO has violated the 150 MW limit.

The DEC Emergency Ruling is not enforceable on the NYISO, which does not
hold permits or exemptions regulated by DEC. If NYISO agrees to abide by
the 150 MW limitation it will apparently be because it volunteers to do
so. I am unaware that the ISO has so agreed.

Consider the following: NYISO is faced with an emergency situation where
the lights would go out in New York City with 150 MW of CDEPGs but could
stay on with 160 MW. I believe that the ISO operators might have no
choice but to order the 160 MW on and preserve reliability,
notwithstanding the DEC limitation.

By placing CDEPGs in the position to be penalized for actions over which
they have literally no knowledge, let alone control, DEC's action
currently forces all emergency generators to seek Registration or State
Facility Permits.

The only apparent alternative is that CDEPGs must be given ironclad
assurances in SOAS-approved Operating Manuals that operations staff can
NEVER call on more than 150 MW of CDEPGs at any given time. Even then,
it is unclear how the ISO can provide generators with conclusive
assurances that they will not find their emergency exempt status
revoked. CDEPGs may be forced to seek real-time certifications from the
NYISO at the time they are called that their activation will not exceed
the 150 MW limit.

I would be interested in the ISO's opinion on whether it can, and will,
limit activations of CDEPGs to less than 150 MW, no matter what the
circumstances.
