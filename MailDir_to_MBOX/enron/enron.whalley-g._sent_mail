We tried all day to sell this volume below.  Market is extremely illiquid, 
given Annex V uncertainty and other regulatory issues: generators believe 
Parente will help them out in May, while LDCs look at their contracts and 
reduced demand.  However AES Sul accepted to buy this volume at 25% discount 
to May spot price, payment on June 25th.  We will net about R$600,000 
(US$250,000) between sale and purchase prices.  Credit is OK.

We will keep a very small, long position at MAE settlement for May.

This is to inform that we have closed 2.200 MWh for May to AES Sul at 25% 
discount rate against spot price at southeast sub-market to be paid on Jun 
25th.

don't know about the relationship with dave,  you'll have to work on that one.

i will talk to stan, but i can't believe he has any interest in developing 
power plants anywhere.

Portland General did just get a dash approved for building about 45 mw in 
oregon.  Stan Horton called me about it, and he was going to have someone in 
Portland (i'll remember the name in a minute)  call tim belden about our 
fundamental analysis of the region.
Stan also mentioned the there is an unregulated side of PGE that is enterring 
into these transactions.  He wondered if that part of PGE should belong in 
EWS.  Talk to tim and we'll decide how to approach that next week.

John,

I hate to whine, but...

EES:
Duran and I talked with Delainey yesterday.  It seems as though we are 
setting up one centralized trading/risk function but we will have overlapping 
origination functions.  I am sure I can work with whatever arrangement you 
make with Dave, but it seems as though we will be tripping over each other in 
the market.  Industrial coverage seems easy, but they want to call on IOU's 
and Munis in order to buy customers.  These are fundamentally large, 
structured short positions that are very similar to what we have been and are 
pitching.  

Transport/Operations:  
Eric Gadd came back from London and reports to Stan Horton.  He heads up an 
Asset Development group that is focusing on, among other things, power plant 
development in the southwest.  This sounds crazy - do you want to call Stan 
or should I?

Portland General:
They are developing generation in Oregon that is competing with one of our 
projects.  No one in RAC has heard of this yet.  Not a big deal, I will call 
Peggy Fowler, but thought you should be aware.

Regards,

Chris

your volume comparison chart is off by a factor of 10.  each contract is 1000 
bbls.

you should look into this.  not that there are necessarily violations, but 
there have to at least be questions.  i used to get a curve report that 
showed curve graphs on a volume bar chart.  have you looked at anything like 
that lately?  you can find problems with a pretty quick scan.

This person hasn't found a violation in a year.  I find that hard to believe.

this announcement has not gone out for that reason.  we have had a number of 
discussions about it since this was drafted and there seems to be some 
concern about it being inside one of the business units since it is supposed 
to handle investments across the company and would be bringing the EBS assets 
with it.  your suggestion that it might report to andy has some merit, but 
there may be other options.  what would you think if we established an 
investment committee consisting of me, rice, and delainey and made garland 
responsible to that group.  we would have all of the relevent business units 
represented and the p&l would ultimately be allocated to the one in which the 
investment originated.  do you think that would work?  it might go a long way 
to satisfying all constituents.

Announcing the Formation of One Corporate Equity Investing Unit

To better develop and manage equity investment opportunities related to our 
core businesses, Enron has formed one corporate equity investment unit.  This 
new unit, Enron Principal Investments, will combine the existing investment 
units of ENA, EBS and Enron Investment Partners.  Additionally, the Enron 
Wholesale Restructuring Group will also become part of Enron Principal 
Investments.  The strategy of Enron Principal Investments will be to work 
with the all the business units of Enron to identify, execute, and manage 
equity investments, which leverage the Enron's unique and proprietary 
knowledge.   These investments may be in the form of venture capital, LBO's, 
traditional private equity and distressed debt positions.   

Kevin Garland will serve as Managing Director of Enron Principal Investments, 
overseeing all of its activities.  Gene Humphrey, Michael Miller, Richard 
Lydecker, and their groups, will join Kevin and his group to form this new 
investments unit.

This new investment unit will report to Greg Whalley, in his capacity as an 
Enron Policy Committee member.  Please join me in congratulating and 
supporting Kevin, Gene, Michael, Richard and the other members of this group 
in this effort.

Jeff Skilling
