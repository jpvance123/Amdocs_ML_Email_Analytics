Kim,
 The language is awkward but okay.  Question, for weekends, Sat, Sun & Mon 
you probably want to use the Gas Daily Midpoint Price published on Tuesday. 
Otherwise, the Tues price is published wednesday, etc  and the friday price 
is published on Monday.  Or do you want to use and average of the price 
applicable for Friday flow and the price applicable for Monday flow for the 
weekend period.  Just questions to consider.  Please call if you need to 
include any of the above concepts in the offer.

I just spoke with Kim and she updated me that her credit manager is very
satisfied with the creditworthiness of United Technologies (he thoroughly
reviewed the website and all available information).  He reports UT has an
A+ rating.  However, he can find no link to CalPeak Power, and could we
please provide that.  Kim would also like some additional specifics on the
mechanisms that are envisioned for credit support from UT to CalPeak.

CalPeak Power, LLC is a project company and is now a wholly owned subisdiary

available at www.utc.com, and from the commercial rating services.

It is not invisioned that CalPeak will benifit from an absolute gurantee
from UTC; however, some credit suport mechanism will be built into the
project and into the fuel supply agreements.

Chris, Frank

Below the notes on the Phelps Dodge meeting of last week. Chris, I would like 
to discuss later today if possible. Frank, thanks for your input. You will be 
glad to hear that nothing much has changed there. If I didn't think PD was 
such a strong take-over candidate, I would be shorting their stock massively.

--CM


The meeting with Phelps Dodge to further discuss their energy/metals 
situation accomplished little. During the course of a 2 1/2 hour meeting with 
Bill Brack (Head of Engineering, and therefore of energy 
management/procurement) and Tim Summers plus Mike McElrath (two of his Energy 
Managers) the following points were covered:

PD will build two new power plants, one in cooperation with Duke and the 
other with BP Amoco. Both to be located in AZ, NM. Coal fired, ca 300 MW, gas 
fired ca 250 MW. They will enter long term contracts for power off-take from 
these power plants to meet their needs. Discussions with potential partners 
have been on-going since last summer. PD sees investment in power plants as 
the only answer to the power crunch. Gas has not yet been sourced. Enron not 
consulted back then due to our non-asset strategy. Details deliberately vague 
on their side.
PD's energy group is unable to discuss any transaction structures which 
involve copper plays. We have probed this to death, and Summers finally 
admitted that their board will not tolerate any suggestions that copper 
upside be "sacrificed" to secure lower/stable priced power. The clear problem 
they are experiencing--that energy price relative to copper price is killing 
them--is being addressed as an energy price problem only. There is interest 
but no mandate within PD's energy group to attempt to address the spread 
issue. 
Medium and long term energy risk management is limited to physical solutions. 
Financial and cross commodity solutions "would never be approved by the 
board".
PD continues to search for "5's and low 6's" on baseload power in a market 
showing 7's and 8's. They remain 100 MW short, which is driving their 
decision to curtail production. We put 5 year indicative low 6's on the table 
through a combination of clipped profiles and calls on copper (at 90 cts/lb) 
but the copper element in the structure sent them running.
After Brack left the room, Summers admitted that the energy group has done no 
deals directly with ENA since Enron almost won the beauty contest to be their 
energy partner two years ago, but included power procurement as an area of 
value add in our presentation to their board, against the wishes of their 
energy team. This clearly rubbed the energy guys the wrong way, and they 
haven't forgotten it--too close to home, clearly.  I can only conclude that 
PD's board would be in a much better position today had they taken Enron's 
advice then. 
A bit of insight (Frank, you'll enjoy this)--PD claims Enron offered "their 
ideas, sold back to them" and "no upside" in our final energy partner 
proposal to them two years ago. When I asked how their counter-proposal to 
Enron back then (identified projects first put to tender--if Enron is low 
bidder, Enron wins project) differed from free consulting, they had no answer.

Summary:
It is clear how PD got into their current energy fix. By admission of the 
energy group, nothing much has changed in the last few years there, either in 
terms of personnel or in terms of mandate. This, despite the fact that the 
viability of a number of PD facilities is in doubt due to energy 
mismanagement. Without top-down involvement, we will get no further with 
their energy team.

We are currently finalising the energy-copper structure we discussed during 
the meeting as I think it is the best option for them. I will also work 
further with Foster in Portland to give them the straight commodity offer. 
Perhaps this can serve as a focal point for future higher level discussions 
outside the sphere of PD's energy group. Joe/Michael-- I will make sure you 
get this, as Kalidas may yet have a role to play. It is unfortunate that the 
approach PD uses to manage their copper position seems much more 
sophisticated than their approach to energy. Results notwithstanding, the 
meeting was surprisingly open and candid on their part--no harm done to the 
metals part of the business.

Attached find quick-look results of our site analysis. Toured the Sierrita 
mine, no easy indication it will be closed end of this month. Personnel 
tight-lipped, though their head of environmental affairs lost little time in 
asking for a job. I have asked Bucky to keep you informed of developments in 
West Coast power, as I suspect their decision on facility closure (at least 
Sierrita) will be determined by power price developments between now and end 
March.

Tim,

Further to our discussion this morning, I have attached a draft of a term 
sheet regarding the development of generation at REU's Clear Creek site with 
the intent of marketing the output to DWR under a 3-6 year tolling agreement.


We think this summer will afford us a great opportunity to negotiate with DWR 
to obtain significant value substantially offsetting the installed cost of 
the unit.  To that end, we want to position ourselves so that we can move 
quickly should DWR make a strong bid for capacity and energy.  
Notwithstanding, we appreciate Redding's obligations regarding its load and 
think that there will be a lot of flexibility with DWR in structuring a 
transaction that meets everyone's needs.

If you are interested, we propose entering into an MOU that summarizes the 
general terms of the transaction and roles and responsibilities.  Let's talk 
after you have reviewed the attached term sheet.

Thanks for your time and interest regarding this opportunity.

Laird

Ken:

Please take a look at this deal summary sheet.  As we discussed, our goal is 
to come up with a structure that we can use for all of our "pool" sales 
behind SoCal and PG&E.  CAn you get with the key folks and see if they like 
the approach and to set the index premiums and discounts?

	Thank you for the information.

	We only have about 1 week to get a long-term energy and gas deal
signed.  Additional information I need to have reviewed by Hampton and
Houston are a copy of the guarantee and a copy of any another collateral or

	Hampton / Houston will need several days to review the terms.
Therefore, I need to get something to them as soon as possible.

	Please call to discuss.

This should probably be researched further.  If they can really build this 
many plants it could have a huge impact on the Cal border basis.  Obviously 
it is dependent on what capacity is added on Kern, PGT and TW but it is hard 
to envision enough subscriptions to meet this demand.  Even if it is 
subscribed it will take 18 months to 2 years to build new pipe therefore the 
El Paso 1.2 Bcf/d could be even more valuable.

Kim, the attached e-mail is from John Gregg.  He is a lawyer from Washington 
DC.  His firm represents alot of the Muni's across the country.  He 
represents Mesa and others in the West.  It appears that Enron is having some 
problems with WIlcox.  Did we give that account to EES ?  Do you know this 
JAmie Bellamy ?  If possible we need to get this cleared up so that John does 
not take it out on us in the furture.

Good to talk with you Frank.  Funny you called when you did.

While you were "gone," the mighty City of Wilcox, AZ signed up with Enron.  I 
got a call today from a frantic city clerk because Enron has fallen a few 
months behind in billing after many months of fine service.  This is bad for 
several reasons, not the least of which is that Enron is paying the pipeline 
for Wilcox.

The reps name is Jamie Bellamy.

Could you kick him in the butt for one of the smallest munis in the country?

Kim -

A couple of thoughts regarding Charles Hinckley's email and your pending trip to San Diego:

1.  I have scoured all of United Technologies' filings and even their website.  I found exactly ZERO references to CalPeak Power, LLC.  I'm not saying that CalPeak ISN'T a wholly-owned subsidiary of United Technologies, but I find it strange that I can't find anything on CalPeak in United's filings/online info.  

2.  If CalPeak is indeed a subsidiary and WILL guarantee CalPeak's obligations, then we are in great shape.  United Technologies is A+ rated, with lots of liquidity available in the form of unused lines of credit.

3.  If CalPeak will not benefit from a United Technologies guaranty, then we definitely need to see their financials/management notes.

Will they send you the financials/notes before you leave for San Diego?

What's your take on this?  They want to meet with me on friday in San Diego to discuss a potential deal as we were short listed on the RFP to supply gas to the Calpeak power plants.  If we can't get credit established and contracts in their hands, I don't know if we want to waste our time - or money.  Let me know what you think ASAP.

It is not invisioned that CalPeak will benifit from an absolute gurantee

Jeff Brown called me today asking for the following:

1.  A contract
2.  Updated pricing for 1 and 2 years out of Jan 1/02 @ PG&E City-gate.

I indicated that you were out until Monday and would get back with him then.

Hope that is okay.

Kim,

We are responding to an RFP from the City of Riverside.  They are looking to install 40 MW of gas fired generation by January 1, 2002 (the actual installation date will probably be April 1, 2002) and require a gas supply.  Their expected capacity factor is only 15% however.  As such, they need a Gas Daily priced supply - up to 12,200 MMBtu/d - which they can call upon with short notice.

Can you provide me the pricing and terms under which ENA would provide this service?

1.  Can we deliver the gas to their plant-gate on SoCal's system?
2.  Would the gas be priced off Gas Daily at SoCal's border + as-billed transport to plant-gate?
3.  What notice period do we require to effect delivery?
4.  What index based price are we willing to do?  High end of the common range, etc...?

Have I missed anything?

The response is due April 18th.  Sorry for the short timeframe.

Laird

Do we hold any material past due receivables for gas supply against specific 
California QFs?   If so, what action are we planning to take?  With the 
prospect of getting 15 cents on the dollar for old receivables and a 
mechanism in place for future QF payments, this might be a time to consider 
forcing the QFs hand.  May be there is an origination opportunity with a 
contract restructuring or purchase of the plants.

I received a call from Mike Danielson today.  He works for the West Power 
Origination group under Chris Calger.  He was interested in learning more 
about what has been transpiring  with PD.  He recently met with Ariz. Elect. 
Power Coop, (AEPCO) who floated the idea of Enron selling them fixed price 
power at Palo Verde and AEPCO selling phyiscal to meet PD needs after the 
AEPCO contract with PD expires.  

We got Joe Robertson on the telephone who indicated you are meeting with PD 
perhaps today.

As we have discussed, our strategy is to not call PD and allow you guys to 
work your magic and let us know when you need assistance on gas or energy 
pricing or physical delivery.
 
Can you give us an update of your efforts so far?  Is there anything that we 
should be doing at this time?

Thanks!

Chris

Barb,

No problem for a July 01 start date on the gas supply we discussed this
morning.  The offer would remain the same whether June is included or not.
Also, we would make a reasonable best efforts to take and/or remarket your
gas when the Griffith plant is down.  Of course, if we couldn't do anything
with it, we would be held harmless.  Pricing would be based on a San Juan
Gas Daily Index minus $.02.  If we have to designate the plant as the
primary delivery point on the capacity, we wouldn't be able to flow the gas
to the border on a firm basis.  We may only be able to sell it back in the
basin.

Give me a call if you have any questions -

Thanks,

Kim Ward

CalPeak was formed as a project company, and is being funded by UTC.

CalPeak was formed less than two months ago, and has no financials.

We will provide a pro forma balance sheet should the bidder be selected.

Types of typical project support are things like a UT gurantee for one
month's fuel supply, etc.

Tim,

Further to our discussion this morning, I have attached a draft of a term sheet regarding the development of generation at REU's Clear Creek site with the intent of marketing the output to DWR under a 3-6 year tolling agreement.
 

We think this summer will afford us a great opportunity to negotiate with DWR to obtain significant value substantially offsetting the installed cost of the unit.  To that end, we want to position ourselves so that we can move quickly should DWR make a strong bid for capacity and energy.  Notwithstanding, we appreciate Redding's obligations regarding its load and think that there will be a lot of flexibility with DWR in structuring a transaction that meets everyone's needs.

If you are interested, we propose entering into an MOU that summarizes the general terms of the transaction and roles and responsibilities.  Let's talk after you have reviewed the attached term sheet.

Thanks for your time and interest regarding this opportunity.

Laird

Kim,

Mike McDonald and I are meeting with the President of Knauf next week.  The 
topic for discussion is energy supply to their facility currently under 
construction in Shasta Lake, CA.  We have previously bid power supplies to 
Shasta who, in turn, sell the power to Knauf.  Knauf wants to meet directly.  
They also want us to look at providing their gas needs - about 2.5 MMcfd.

Can I get your help in getting quotes for natural gas supplies to their 
facility.  I need PG&E city-gate prices for a 1, 4 and 9 year, 2.5 MMcfd 
baseload supply starting July 1, 2001.  I will ask Tracy Ngo about credit.

We are meeting with Knauf next Thursday in Indianapolis, so I need pricing by 
late Tuesday.  We need to leave at the crack of dawn on Wednesday to get to 
Indy.

Thanks,

Laird

The memo attached summarizes a structured deal that the market has shown some interest.  

Essentially, this deal allows an LDC to defer payment for gas and avoid carrying costs (which may result in a dollar for dollar benefit to your customer's bottom line).  

We have done two of these deals to date.  ENA has interest in additional deals (albeit not an infinite appetite) if the structure allows us to move them off the balance sheet.

Please review the memo and target any of your customers that may have an interest.  

Each deal will require a new quote from credit and from the cost of funds group.  Gas structuring is set up to structure these deals and develop them through to execution.  

Please call me with any questions at x36751

Kim:

I spoke to Andrew Gregoricj of Asarco today.  He is an EP Full Requriementst 
customer.  I used to sell him gas when he was at BHP.  He is the energy 
manager at Asarco, gas and power.  He buys about 3,500 MMBtu/d.  He is 
contracted through Sep.  I will be working with him on power.  Please make a 
note of his information so you can work with him in the future.

Kim,

I have attached a draft of a term sheet regarding the provision of gas procurement services to Riverside.  Can you look at this and help me with the pricing, terms, delivery, etc....

The RFP is due on the 20th; however, we have to get it buttoned up by Wednesday the 18th.  Hope this is not a problem.

 

Thanks,

C:

I spoke to Choi Lee today.  It is hard for me to remain professional with him 
as his arrogance and illogic is very frustrating, but our discussion was very 
cordial.  He indicated that Enron has not brought forth any proposal of 
substance.  This apprarently means we have not offered them energy at below 
market prices.  I indicated that should he find some of that energy in the 
"$50 - $60" range to give me a call as we would be willing to buy in the "70s 
and the 80s."  I was not able to learn when he would be in the market to buy, 
but I encouraged him to give me a call if he wanted a price quote.  I don't 
have much confidence that he would call even if he was buying.  I will leave 
it up to him to call rather than make this a priority to chase as the 
opportunities with PD seem to be limited.  If they do need energy I expect 
they will keep the term short and shop it pretty hard.  There mining 
operation plans seem tenuous and they think prices are going to fall.  With 
APS and Salt River out there in the shorter duration markets we wouldn't make 
much money anyway.

Please do not hesitate to call if the situation changes and you need a 
electricy price quote for a structure you are working on.

Thanks!

Chris

Kim -

A couple of thoughts regarding Charles Hinckley's email and your pending trip 
to San Diego:

1.  I have scoured all of United Technologies' filings and even their 
website.  I found exactly ZERO references to CalPeak Power, LLC.  I'm not 
saying that CalPeak ISN'T a wholly-owned subsidiary of United Technologies, 
but I find it strange that I can't find anything on CalPeak in United's 
filings/online info.  

2.  If CalPeak is indeed a subsidiary and WILL guarantee CalPeak's 
obligations, then we are in great shape.  United Technologies is A+ rated, 
with lots of liquidity available in the form of unused lines of credit.

3.  If CalPeak will not benefit from a United Technologies guaranty, then we 
definitely need to see their financials/management notes.

Will they send you the financials/notes before you leave for San Diego?

J. -

What's your take on this?  They want to meet with me on friday in San Diego 
to discuss a potential deal as we were short listed on the RFP to supply gas 
to the Calpeak power plants.  If we can't get credit established and 
contracts in their hands, I don't know if we want to waste our time - or 
money.  Let me know what you think ASAP.

CalPeak Power, LLC is a project company and is now a wholly owned subisdiary

It is not invisioned that CalPeak will benifit from an absolute gurantee
from UTC; however, some credit suport mechanism will be built into the
project and into the fuel supply agreements.

Kevin:

My lack of response this week has not been because I have not been thinking about a possible structure.  It is because the new FERC cap is making it difficult to figure out how a project like this is going to operate.  A few thoughts:

I.  CDWR Dispatch Issues:  It remains unclear to me how the communication with GWF/CDWR will work each day.  What time will we get an indication of the volume they want?  If the communication occurs late, it will be difficult to obtain much value from the capacity they do not need.  Even if the communication occurs late, with the current cap there is little value in the "extra" MWs at your heat rate, given the current FERC cap and gas prices.  Given that there could be very little value on the "extra" MWs, we would ask for a monthly fee in the neighborhood of $10,000 to schedule the CDWR volumes.  To fine tune this number we need to clarify a few things.  Will we be invoicing CDWR?  What is the scheduling timing?  What is the Enron liability for failure to submit the schedule?  Do you want us to submit supplemental bids for your "extra" capacity on your behalf to abide by the FERC order?  What happens if you are dispatched at a loss when we forget to put in Supplemental Energy Bids.

2.  Gas Pricing:  Here is a summary of possible gas pricing for you.

1.		GWF pays demand charge equal to Maximum Daily Quantity (MDQ) times $.05/MMBtu.
2.		GWF schedules gas each day with the Enron up to the MDQ.  The Daily Contract Quantity (DCQ) is the amount GWF schedules each day.
3.	Quantities above the DCQ can be made available on a mutually acceptable basis.
4.  	GWF pays variable charge equal to DCQ times Gas Daily Mid-Point for PG&E City gate, plus $.05/MMBtu.  
5.	GWF can substititue for the Gas Daily price with a NGI PG&E City Gate Price or a Fixed Price upon mutual agreement..
6.	GWF responsible for any imbalance charges resulting from using a volume different than the DCQ.
7.	Enron responsible for imbalance charges when they deliver a quantity other than the DCQ.
8.	The Monthly Consumption Quantity (MCQ) is the sum of daily usage.
9.	If GWF does not want to be in the Enron Enron Contracted marketer Pool, GWF will be responsible for managing imbalances between the DCQ and actual 	usage.
10.	If GWF wants to be in the Enron Enron Contracted marketer Pool, differences between the MCQ and the sum of the DCQs shall be cashed out as follows 	provided Imbalance Charges are not incurred. EPMI will purchase the volume by which the sum of the DCQs exceeds the MCQ at the average of the 5 	highest days Gas Daily Mid-Point and sell the volume by which the sum of the DCQs is less than the MCQ at the average of the 5 lowest days Gas Daily Mid-	Point. If Imbalance Charges are incurred then either 6 or 7 would apply.  
 
In conclusion, I recognize that you might think $10k/Month is steep.  However, Scheduling Coordination is labor intensive and risky, particularly with the FERC cap and the political quagmire.  That said, I definitely think we can help you guys optimize your generation, but .  At a minimum we can buy your energy from time to time.  We can also set you up with Enron Online for no cost, providing the most transparent price information available in the industry today.  For these reasons, I want to get Master Agreements in place.  The first step in this process is for you to provide financial statements.  Can you send those to me?

Something that might work for you guys is to use the APX to be your SC.  This will require more work  on your part, but it is a low cost option.

Another thing is to watch out for firms offering low prices for SC services without giving you a clear indication of what they will pay you for your "extra" MWs.  They will  make their $ somewhere.Do not limit yourself to one counterparty.  IN this age you need multiple trading partners to optimize your generation.

I will call to discuss.

Thanks

Chris

    Chris, by giving this a quick look, it appears your fees of 5$/mw-hr
   would
   add up to be quite a large number for a 100 MW block of power for say
   8000
   hours a year.  Are we reading this correctly?

   Please copy your response to Duane, Rob, Casey and myself.

   Thank You,

   Kevin

      Chris;

      Attached are the talking points we have prepared for what we are
   looking
      for
      with an SC/Gas Supplier/Energy Marketer.  We are in the process of
      establishing a confidentiality release with California Department Of
      Water
      Resources (CDWR) so we can share aspects of our contracts with Enron.
      Until
      then, I can only be vague.  But in a nut shell we are in the process
   of
      installing 2-LM 6000 in the Hanford California area that will be
      operational
      9/01 (Phase I).  Phase II is also in the Hanford area, again 2-LM
      6000's.
      Phase III is located near Tracy California and this will consist of 2
   GE
      7EA's.  Initially all of these units are simple cycle.  There is an
      option
      for Phase III to be converted to a combined cycle unit.  The combined
   MW
      capacity of the simple cycle is 340MW.  If we close the loop at
   Tracy,
      this
      will increase by approximately 90 MWs.  CDWR has dispatch rights of
   so
      many
      hours per year, and they have first pick.  In a rough cut, assume we
      will
      have about 1/2 a year in hours for the first three phases that could
   be
      in
      the market.

      The option we are exploring is can we establish a win-win relation
   ship
      with
      a company like Enron that would supply our gas needs, be able to
      schedule
      our power (both for CDWR and our own account), and be able to market
   our
      power (outside of CDWR's requirements).  Potentially a incentive
      fee/tiered
      structure would be workable.  We are open to ideas.

      Based on our initial conversation, it sounded like you may be
      interested.
      We would like to get together to discuss our options with you.  As I
      said in
      my voice mail, I will be out of the office until next Thursday
   (6/21).
      Thursday afternoon or Friday (6/21 or 22) would work for us to have
   this
      first meeting.  I will have to check the following week availability.

      I will be in the office the rest of today and will be periodically
      checking
      both e-mail and voice mail while I am out.

      If you have questions about the gas side our this transaction, please
      contact Jeff Hosfelt at (925) 431-1422.

      Thank you for your consideration,

Kim, thank you so much for organizing the conference call last Friday, and
for taking part in our RFP process.  But based upon our meetings/call with
shortlisted suppliers, CalPeak has decided to proceed with other
supplier(s). I sincerely appreciate your participation in our process - it
was great to get to know you in person, especially since Jeff Fuller up in
our Bellevue office enjoys working with you.  I and others at CalPeak look
forward to continued opportunities to work with you and Enron in the future.

Ann,

Attached is a draft of Enron's response to your request for proposals for
gas supply to power generation plant in development by Calpeak Power, LLC.
As requested, Enron has provided indexed pricing with the option to convert
to various fixed priced products during the term of the agreement.

The  options  presented  are  not  intended to represent a complete list of
opportunities,  but  are representative of the different pricing structures
Enron  offers.   There  are several additional structures available  and we
look forward to discussing these options with you.

Please call me with any questions you might have regarding the proposal.  I
look forward to hearing from you soon.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

Mark,

The best person to talk to about the ISDA is me.  I discussed an ISDA with
Tim Roberts when I was in the Salt River offices on March 23rd.  A draft
ISDA was sent to Bill Abraham on November 17, 1999.  I requested for a new
legal review on 3/28/01.  Let me know if you need a new draft and I can
send you or Tim a copy.  My number is 713-853-0685.

Thanks for your inquiry -

Kent,

Attached is a draft copy of our Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical
natural gas transactions.  As I mentioned before, we can enter into
transactions for less that one year out.  However, for those outside of a
year and for longer terms, we need to have a master in place.  Hopefully,
we can get this one in place so that we will be prepared when/if we get
ready to transact.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I will have our legal guys standing
by to help, too.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

Kim and Barry -

I had a couple of thoughts with respect to our meeting yesterday on 
municipals.  It appears to me that with the California municipals especially, 
accellerating the entire sales process will be critical.  I'm thinking about 
how we can get in place as much of the required paper as possible prior to 
negotiating deal terms.  Much of the required documentation (proof of 
authority to transact, outside legal opinion, etc.) will be difficult to push 
until you are actually negotiating with these counterparties, as there won't 
be any incentive on their part to drive these issues.  However, from our end, 
we can prepare all of the required contracts prior to any meetings with these 
counterparties so that we don't lose any time on that front.

With that in mind, do you have a list of target counterparties that you will 
be attacking in the near term?  If so, please forward to me and I will begin 
the process of reviewing from a credit standpoint and putting together draft 
Master contracts to put in front of the counterparties.  It will take me some 
time to get through reviews/contracts/etc., but if you have a list of 
targets, I can at least get started.

If you have any thoughts on how I can help you develop some of this business, 
please let me know.


Thanks,

Jay

Kim:

This is a gas generator with whom we are working.  We have an EEI.  Ed Sacks has been the credit point person.  They have a cogen plant, Yuba City Cogen, that is looking at a five year energy sale to PG&E and want to back it with a 5 year gas purchase.  Can you give him a call to discuss?  (Paul - Kim's number in Houston is 713/853-0685.

Chris,

Thanks for the discussion today. As we discussed, Our Yuba City project is
exploring and very interested in a long term (3 to 5 year) gas supply deal
with Enron.  We would like to speak with someone in your Houston office about
this.

Also, we would like to further understand the path to access of Enron Online.
 I'll call soon to discuss.

Sincerely,
Paul Cummins

Barry,

Attached is a copy of the CPUC order changing the SRAC payment formula from 
SoCal to Malin.  Also attached is a diagram showing how we could structure a 
hedge for those QFs buying term gas at SoCal index (or simply sell SoCal 
priced at Malin).

Walter,

I was out sick most of the day yesterday.  Sorry.  These volumes are
really small for me to work with since I am on the Wholesale side of
Enron.  However, I have passed the information and your name on to Derek
Kelly who works with our retail customers out of the San Francisco
office.  If he is not able to help you - please let me know.

Thanks,

Kim
