Rick - Linda is tied up with Rick and Mark.  She asked that John and I get with you today so we can get final approval for the transparency language.  Leon with the Committee called us this morning seeking our thoughts.  Give us a ring when you have a chance and then we can follow up with Loiuse.

Thanks - Chris
 


Attached reflects our efforts to further tighten the language on transparency.

Hi Don,

the investment climate out there is very harsh, as you probably know. For me to raise VC money I need to show client business.
If you could confirm to me on a non-binding basis that Enron Americas is looking to continue to use DealBench datarooms and that a platform lease of a substantial value could be reached, that would help me a great deal in the process. Please feel free to amend in any way you feel fit and be as specific or unspecific as you see appropriate.

Please reply to my Enron e-mail as well as my private e-mail

tobiasmunk@yahoo.com

Thanks very much and I will be in touch (after the quarter and your successful divestitures :-)

Well...

Due to calendar conflicts at Utilicorp, their President, Jim Miller and the Vice-President of the Utilicorp Utilities, Gail McMinn, will not be together and execute documents until next Monday, October 8.  The have an internal approval process similar to our DASH and they could not get all parties to execution by today.  

None of us like delays, but I remain extremely positive and assured on this transaction.

Laura

Hi Louise,  

As a followup from yesterday, this spreadsheet contains a comparison from June 1 - mid July.  The Q3 comparison from yesterday only contains two weeks of data, so this might give a more meaningful comparison.

Thanks!

Thanks for taking time this morning to go over some goals for EnronOnline.  As far as I'm concerned, the platform we have is astonishing, and I agree that the more we lengthen our lead over the competition (in both trading and technology) the better our chances of landing some private marketplace sales.  To that end, Jay and I will begin hounding the trading heads and rounding up development needs and potential enhancements to boost trade volume and revenue.  Also, we'll get Kal focused on periodic face-lifts of the GUI.  Then we will devote Origination attention to third party sales which will validate our contention that the platform has value outside of its considerable worth to Enron.  If resources become constrained, it will simply mean that we are finding traction in the right places.

Yes, I am excited about this job, and yes, I want to be in the hot seat you and Greg are describing.  I hope I can run ideas past you from time to time and I trust you will let me know when you have comments or concerns.

Thanks,
Brad

Now lets see what the future holds........

Please keep in touch. You can reach me under 001-936-271-0770 for at least another month and my private e-mail is

It would be great if you fired me a quick mail with your contact details so that I can keep in touch.

Take care y'all

Louise,

I believe that if we want the Broker Client Contracts to be a source of $$ then we will need to wait and negotiate new contracts in several months after we reestablish a dominant position.

If we want the Brokers to help us build liquidity immediately, we should give them the contracts for free - and pay them brokerage.

Your thoughts?

Dave

Louise,

Sorry to bother you with this request, but I'm not sure who else to ask:

A number of people have expressed an interest in the details of the auction process and any insight it might provide as to what a final deal might look like.

Are there publically available documents covering the auctions process and descriptions of compliant bids?

Dave

Louise/Rahil -- I wanted to ask your artistic opinion on this agency's site.  I am thinking about hiring them to update the look and feel and tour for EnronOnline.  They have done some very interesting things with movements within photographs, 3-D, layers and typography.  I'll work through the proper approval channels (Greg Piper, Jay Webb and Brad) before doing anything, but I just wanted your artistic opinion.

This spreadsheet shows trade counts by counterparty for the month of October.  Each column represents a date, starting from today going back to October 1.  Only counterparties with at least 500 trades in all of October are shown.  The yellow highlighted rows are those counterparties that appear to be off their typical trading pace.

Thanks so much for the kind words and support. I'm very sad to see Kal moving on, he's been such a wonderful mentor.

Hello

I know Kal is moving on to pastures new, I am sure both of you continue will to do the outstanding work you have done working with Kal without him.  With him leaving you both jump up one level.  Brad is a good guy so get to know him and see how it works out - I'm sure it will.  If you have any problems come and see me and I'll get Kal back! (joke!) but seriously my door is always open for a chat.

Hi Savita,
 
Attached is the ugly first cut at data for Canada. The sheets are a jumble of information, but the jist of it is this:
 
*Canada did a lot more activity on their NIT term physical products during the peak May-July00 period than they did during the low Nov00-Jan01 period. (3000 trades vs 1550 trades). 
 
*The only significant product offering difference between the two periods was the GD/D Sumas product, which was offered in May-July, but not Nov-Jan. (accounts for relatively few trades)
 
* Enron North America did a higher percentage of the trading on Canadian Gas products in Nov00-Jan01 than they did during the earlier months.
 
* There are a handful of counterparties such as Murphy Oil and Dynegy Marketing which conducted business with Canada on EOL before and since the Nov-Jan lull period, but did not do online transactions with us during the three months where our trade volumes and deal counts were lowest.

I have your EOL budget numbers.  Also, we really need to talk about this credit idea soon.  FSA and VMAC are anxious to do a deal, and I really think it can work.

Brad,

I had a conversation with Wally Turbeville from VMAC at around 11 AM. From his conversations with the main players in the industry he got feedback that "they are very enthousiastic about negotiating a deal that would free cash for Enron" (his words). He offered his support to negotiate with the industry players and wants to set up a meeting sometimes this week.

We have a potential deal with Allegheny for them to post a coal product on EnronOnline.  The total value is thin but the desk is supportive and Dan Diamond has been charging ahead.  In light of Enron's position currently, do we gain or lose media points by announcing in the near future that EOL is allowing third parties to post on their site?  If you are against this, we need to crawfish our way out of the deal with Allegheny and put an all-stop on the 1 or 2 others we've been pursuing.  If you think it can be spun in a good way for Enron, give me your thoughts and we'll close the deal.

I know you're underwater right now, but I don't want to close this deal on the assumption that you're OK and find out later you weren't.

I hope this isn't too late.  If you need to reach me, I'm in the London office today and tomorrow.

I think the correct approach is to revise the functionality and add a line or two to the description of how limit orders work, an answer in the FAQ section, a line for the 'Failed Transaction' screen and a script for the help desk.  I'm thinking of something to the effect of:

Once a limit order has been placed by a counterparty, that counterparty will not be able to complete a transaction with Enron in that product on the other side of the market at the price specified in the limit order.  For example, if a counterparty enters a limit order to sell to Enron at price x, that counterparty may not buy from Enron at price x while the limit order is active.

Note that this needs to be done on a counterparty basis, not at the sub user level.  That needs to be clear from the language we use so I have avoided the chattier 'you' and used counterparty.

The 'Failed Transaction' screen could show the failure reason as:

'Your company has an active limit order in effect at the price at which you attempted to transact.  The limit order system does not allow you to transact with Enron on both sides of the market at the same price simultaneously.'

If you want to keep it short, the second sentence is optional as long as the necessary descriptive language appears somewhere on the web site.

If you want ENW to work in the same direction as you, let us know what the goal is beforehand.  You know I've tried to communicate.

Talk with richter and louise together if possible. Initially newco would only get an exclusive license for gas and power and not the code but I think creditors should have options so brad is still looking at determining eol value outside of a newco deal.

Can Brad Richter and Savita Puthigai attend the next trader meeting you have to let all the traders know that Savita and her organization (call center, product control, business analysis, trader support, etc.) now report officially to Brad Richter going forward and not Jay Webb?  

Savita and I discussed this today and we both agree that this is best and that explicit change should occur now.  Savita is still committed to staying until the end of 2001, getting in some new talent in her group, training Brad, working with Webb, taking care of the traders, etc.  I will talk with her in December or January about what might be next for her.

Jay Webb is also supportive of this.  When he and I agreed that Savita reporting to him was taking him away from a large, complex development job, he said Brad should take the role.  Jay works well with Brad and thinks Brad, with time, will work well in Andy Zipper's old role.  Jay also signed a new contract recently and is committed to leading all technical and operational issues for EnronOnline and will be working closely with Brad and Savita.

Let me know your thoughts.

Thought you might be interested in these.

My instructions to the team have been: "Same, but different", i.e. a freshening, without any real functional changes, so as to both (a) Reinforce that it is a new entity behind NETCo Online and (b) ensure an easy transition for customers who are used to how EnronOnline works.

Hi Dave, 
    We are putting together a new look and feel for the re-launch of the website pending a deal.  We have a designer on Teresa Smith's team who developed these concepts.  There is a lot of preliminary work we can do in preparation, once we've chosen a design. Kal and I both liked the first one.  Please let me know what you think.

I spoke to Mark and he outlined 2 potential fixes to the spread dilemma.  We can leave it the way it is (with some clarifying changes to the descriptions) or we can ask either the gas or the power desk to completely change their products.  Neither one is a very elegant solution.  Jay and I are scheduling meetings with each of the desks over the next few weeks, and I would like to take that opportunity to diligence the issue in person with the traders.  In short, we're working on it.

Subject:	Spread

We have some inconsistency in the way we are doing spreads it was OK when it was US and UK but now we are doing it different ways here.   Andy will tell you that this was sort of forseen.  We do need to sort out something - maybe more in the short description which helps to indentify what you are buying and what you are selling.

Mark Taylor is the guy to talk to .

Assume ENW is doing for you what you need done during this difficult time.  
 
I know what Sally and her team have been doing for the effort for the last few weeks as well as systems and EOL.  I have been working with Jay Webb, Brad Richter, Sally, Bob Hall, Pickering, etc. constantly on many issues, including EA, and they tell me you are getting what you need.
 
I assume you will call directly if you are not getting anything you need or are concerned or need me personally for anything.
 
Thanks.

Louise, 

I want to make sure we are on exactly the same wavelength here:

EnronOnline (i.e. the people on the list you gave me) now reports to you through me and therefore is no longer a part of Enron Networks.

Right?

I shoulda learned to get out on the web

I shoulda learned, they have it hyped in the press

Look at that volume, they are the market share leader

I can't understand why the stock's under distress

And he's 50000 up there, what's that, no nymex noises

Every one wants one, even Dynegy.

Oh, that ain't workin' that's the way you do it

Buyin' for nothin' get your commissions forf ree

Where do you stand on Broker Client?  As you can see below, some of the European desks are supportive of getting deals done, but I am leery of continuing Broker Client roll-out if there remains a chance that we will pull back from this offering in the near future.  Also, I ran into Presto and he said he hadn't yet spoken to you about his issues with the product.  Let me know what your position is and we'll go from there.

Thanks,
Brad

Brad,
It looks like I have taken back control of the TFS Europe deal.  I have received confirmation from each of the different desks that this is something they are willing to pursue.  I went back to Alan Kurzer (president of TFS) with 300,000 Euros (about $265k USD) for Continental Power, UK power and Int'l. Coal.  He didn't bite so I told him to show me a bid.  I'll let you know how it goes.  I've got a call into Mark Greenberg about the contractual issues.  It should be something we can address in the amendment.

OK-- level set.  The tone of my message was not meant to be confrontational.  I had a number of meetings with Tobias to discuss his plans, which as of Thursday had not panned out.  I simply wanted to make sure that Ross and I were getting the latest news from ENA especially if you were considering using the platform in any longer-term manner, which is new information.  Don has been one of our biggest supporters, and I certainly want to make sure he gets some input on the direction of DealBench.  I just didn't want it to go through Tobias first.
 
Sorry for the confusion,
Brad

Sorry this is getting a bit messed up.  As I said on Friday, Tobias came to see me to say goodbye and sated that he may consider buying DealBanch if he can raise the money (this would obviously be great for ENW).  I told hiim we (ENA) would be a customer of DealBench (as we intend to continue using it next year or find another method).  I intorduced Don and Tobias and said that we could give him some sort of contract if he were to pitch a DealBench buyout..  As you all know he only left Friday and has had no discussions with anyone and this is purely conceptual, my guess is he gets another energy trading job in Europe.
 
I only forwarded the note to you for information post our Friday discussion to ensure you were happy with us replying and what you wanted us to say.  The response to Don is somewhat inappropriate as it wasn't Tobias contacting Don out of the blue but following the conversation I relayed to Greg.
 
Let us know whether you are happy for ENA to agree to a contract or not  should he ever buy it from you - its that simple and a really long shot.  As discussed on Friday, ENA will not support DealBench on an allocated basis, the economics of being the only customer simply do not work.  If we continue on the same charging basis with perhaps a minimum that's fine.
 
No idea how we got down this path.

Since Tobias Munk is no longer an employee of Enron as of last week, please direct all correspondance concerning DealBench to either me or Ross Mesquita.  We will then contact potential purchasers or investors at the appropriate time.  As you know, we are currently formulating our plans for the platform and we would appreciate any input you have to that end.  If you have any questions, please feel free to give me a call.

Hi Don, 

the investment climate out there is very harsh, as you probably know. For me to raise VC money I need to show client business.

If you could confirm to me on a non-binding basis that Enron Americas is looking to continue to use DealBench datarooms and that a platform lease of a substantial value could be reached, that would help me a great deal in the process. Please feel free to amend in any way you feel fit and be as specific or unspecific as you see appropriate.

Please reply to my Enron e-mail as well as my private e-mail 

tobiasmunk@yahoo.com 

Thanks very much and I will be in touch (after the quarter and your successful divestitures :-) 

Tobias Munk

Louise -

What I'm proposing is that when someone visiting the EnronOnline site clicks on a link to a market page (i.e., US Natural Gas), a new browser window will open taking them to www.enron.com/wholesale/(whatevercommodity).  The EnronOnline page from which they came will also remain open.

The markets pages migrated to enron.com will include a prominent link back to the EnronOnline homepage (we'll work with B. Rigney here), but Jay feels we should not allow a login to EnronOnline from the enron.com pages as that may send users 'scary' security alerts, depending on the security settings of their browsers.

Regards,
Erica

Per Mark Palmer's instruction, I am forwarding this report issued by Dr. Phil Verleger on Monday, October 29 regarding EnronOnline.  Verleger is often used a source by the New York Times, so we would like to refute his claims.  Do we have someone who can analyze his claims and create a point-counterpoint document to his comments about EnronOnline?  Please advise.

John Arnold asked me this morning about individuals on EOL.  Apparently,. John was told that I had a problem with this.  I haven't had a conversation on this since 1999,. At that time I sidelined the issue as it was complex, bearing in mind everything else that was going on.  I would suggest you and Mark address tis together.
I have no idea who told John this as I haven't had a dizcussion on this issue since 1999.

FYI. Aquilla's plan is described below.  

I talked with Martin Chavez at Kiodex and he confirmed as well.

I think the bigger issue is that other enterprises are starting to try to build businesses around their systems and operations.  I think we have a good head start with CommodityLogic and Kiodex but we have to run even faster now.

Brad,

You are right, Aquila's Risk180 is similar to Kiodex's offering. It is a web-based Reporting and Valuation Tool (no software downloads are needed). The difference is that Risk180 focuses on reporting and valuation. In other words, Risk180 does not offer Pricing Calculators as does Kiodex's. It seems to me that Kiodex's Risk Workbench is a more robust solution because it provides decision tools to price opportunities before transacting while Risk180 is "after the fact" reporting and transacting. It looks to me that when Commodity Logic launches its Risk Valuation modules  it will become more of a direct competitor to Risk180. 

In its initial phase, Risk180 is offering services to the Gas market only. Soon, they will offer the tools for the power markets.

Risk180's products:
OTC Trade Preview - details of transactions as entered into system
Daily/Monthly Futures and Forwards Reports - position exposures and daily Pal's based on mark-to-market accounting
Options Valuation Report - measures exposures due to options plus volatility calculations (i.e. Greeks)
Daily / Monthly Total Position Summary - total picture of risk exposure in the portfolio

Risk180's target market:
Similar to Commodity Logic's market. They will target medium to small shops that do not have the technology, staff, or resources to run sophisticated reporting and valuation in-house.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Leonardo

See below.  Could you take 10 minutes and go to the Risk180 site and give me a brief download on what they're offering?  It seems like a "Kiodex-lite" product (talk to Brandon is you don't know Kiodex) but I want to make sure we're not in the same space.

Thanks,
Brad

Aquila Launches Cost-Effective Energy Risk Management Service
KANSAS CITY, Mo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 27, 2001--Aquila, Inc. (NYSE: ILA <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ila&d=t> - news </n/i/ila.html>), one of the largest North American wholesalers of natural gas and electricity and risk management organizations, today launched Risk180(SM), a product that provides clients with full-service management of their commodity transactions, delivered to them daily, weekly or monthly via the Web. 
Risk180 will be marketed to utilities, municipalities, energy aggregators and small energy marketers, as well as large industrial firms. These clients typically are low-volume traders that use spreadsheets to manage their energy transactions. The product was designed to meet the deal capture and portfolio valuation needs of clients who do not wish to purchase or build an expensive, enterprise-wide risk management software system. 
Using a password-protected Web-interface, clients send Aquila their transactions or trades, which are then processed through the company's proprietary system. The client then receives daily, weekly or monthly risk analysis and deal pricing reports. 
``What we are doing is making it possible for these clients to have access to a highly sophisticated trading organization, its skills and most important, its collective knowledge,'' said Jennifer Fisher, Aquila vice president and head of the Radius Group. 
Aquila's Radius Group jointly developed Risk180 with SunGard Trading and Risk Systems, a leading energy risk management software firm. A key component of the Risk180 package is its use of SunGard's Epsilon software for risk analysis and client reporting. 
Risk180 will initially handle only natural gas transactions. Power transaction capabilities will be added in the near future. Data available to clients includes detailed portfolio valuation, evening over-the-counter trade previews, mark-to-market income reports, total position reports as well as forward curves, deal capture and value-at-risk calculations. Additional information is available at www.aquila.com <http://www.aquila.com>, or www.risk180.com <http://www.risk180.com> 
Based in Kansas City, Aquila is one of the top wholesalers of electricity and natural gas in North America and is an innovative provider of risk management products and services. The company also owns and controls a diverse portfolio of merchant assets, including power plants, gas storage, pipeline, and processing facilities, and other complementary merchant infrastructure facilities. Outside North America, Aquila provides wholesale energy services in the United Kingdom, Scandinavia and Germany. Aquila is 80 percent owned by UtiliCorp United (NYSE: UCU <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ucu&d=t> - news </n/u/ucu.html>), a multinational energy company based in Kansas City with more than 4 million customers. It operates in the United States, Canada, New Zealand and Australia.

Louise,

I am trying to prepare a set of contract templates for NewcoOnline, which will give us a starting position to show to the new buyer.

There is an alternative for the GTC's, which I would like to address in advance:

a) Master Agreements which appear online and can therefore be accepted online for online or offline business.

b) The existing GTC principle (derived from the long form confirms)

I have spoken to several people in trading and opinions are evenly split.

I prefer the simple GTC as it will help us to do more business sooner (full masters will take longer for companies to review, and they're going to want to negotiate the full master, anyway).

What is your preference?

Dave

The enclosed spreadsheet shows the net online position by product, by counterparty, for a number of liquid gas products.  Each column represents the life-to-date position generated on that product, for that customer, through the date in the heading of the column.  

I don't see an immediate indication of these customer closing out of positions.  

If I can put this into a more convenient form, let me know what would help.

Thanks!
 -jay

After reviewing calenders, etc., I recommend the following:

Launch on August 6th (assuming the launch checklist is complete and we have all signoffs). Next week is final PRC for me, Whalley etc. early in the week and I am out Thursday and Friday next week.  Therefore we can show the entire checklist and functionality to Whalley the following week, hopefully around August 1st or so, and then you can roll from test into production on that weekend and go out Monday the 6th.

Can we meet on this Friday to review? 

Next Monday and Tuesday are all day PRC and then Wednesday at noon I go out of town for the rest of the week.

I would like to hold any official launch until the week of July 30 - August 3.  We also need to review it early that week so I can tell Whalley we are all good to go.

Greg:

Sending this update in lieu of today's 11:00 meeting.  In summary, all departments are working with a finalized 
checklist, which is attached.  Of the 8 functional areas involved here, only one has a potential issue that would 
delay a launch past the July 23rd scheduled date.  This is ConfirmLogic.  Some minor "bugs" were identified by 
users.  The Confirm IT group has made modifications and will retest today or tomorrow.  If the testing does not 
go well, there could be a production delay.

Other noteworthy item is from PR.  They have decided to delay any press release until the market conditions 
are appropriate.

As I have been given responsibility for completion of this list, please feel free to contact me regarding any 
issues or comments.  If I am unavailable, you might try Doug Feuhne at 5-3992.

THIS EMAIL CONTAINS THE OLD PA AND ETA VERSIONS. NEW VERSIONS ARE BEING DRAFTED.



Louise,

As discussed, there are a few items for which we will need the approval of the new Buyer as soon as possible, in order to ensure we are able to proceed with a relaunch of EnronOnline (NETCoOnline) without delay.

Two of the items for which we need approval as soon as possible are the Password Application (PA) and Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA), which work together to provide electronic trading access to the products available on NetcoOnline.

Following is a brief description of the EnronOnline contractual framework and copies of the proposed ETA and PA, which have been revised from the initial EnronOnline versions to reflect experience of the last two years.


Contracts Structure

There are three key documents that create the contractual environment for NetcoOnline: the 'Password Application' (PA), the 'Electronic Trading Agreement' (ETA) and the commodity contracts in the form of 'General Terms and Conditions' (GTCs) (or, alternatively, a Master Agreement). The PA is the only document which needs a written signature from the customer. The other documents are accepted online.


PassWord Application (PA)

The PA is a one-page document and is the only document that has to be physically signed by the counterparty (as opposed to any of the other documents, which are accepted online by clicking acceptance). The PA is the document by which the customer agrees to be bound by the terms of the ETA and the GTCs.  

The PA, signed by an authorized person in the counterparty company, and approved by Netco, allows the customer to obtain a Master User ID. The Master User will be able to set up all traders and administrative users within his/her company and administer their access to various products in NetcoOnline. 

We will send copies of the PA to likely customers of NetCoOnline before we launch the site. The document will also be available to be printed from the website after we launch. Customers will specify their Initial Password in the PA and must change it in the first log-in session. Upon receipt of signed PA, Netco will under normal circumstances enable the Master User Passwords within 24 hours for pre-approved customers. For counterparties with whom we are not familiar, more time is needed to run credit, legal, contracts, regulatory and tax check.


Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA)

The ETA binds counterparties to completed transactions through NetcoOnline. When the counterparty accesses NetcoOnline for the first time, he/she will be prompted to read and accept the ETA in order to proceed. The ETA states that all trades done via NetcoOnline will be governed by the General Terms and Conditions (GTCs) posted online for a particular product, unless there is a Master or any other Agreement between Netco and the counterparty in place.


General Terms and Conditions (GTC)

When a customer offers to transact in a Product type for the first time, he/she will be presented with the relevant GTC. The GTC's are similar to a streamlined Master Agreement, in that they provide the general contractual framework for multiple transactions in a given commodity. GTC's identify termination rights, provisions for security (as appropriate), operational conventions (nominations, etc.), payment periods, tax treatments, force majeure, penalties for non-performance, etc. 

Customers must accept the terms of the relevant GTC online in order to proceed with a transaction, unless the company has a Master Agreement in place with Netco. Only one acceptance of GTC per Product Type per company is required. If there is a valid Master Agreement, then the system will not display the GTC, and the Master Agreement will apply.


Password Application:  

 

Electronic Trading Agreement:

Hi David.  This is the popup that we displayed until today:


EnronOnline is now available to our customers to transact only in order to provide a means to manage 
Enron credit exposure.  While transactions may be available, customers entering into transactions
should carefully evaluate their positions and Enron's current credit status before transacting.
By entering into a transaction, customers are agreeing that the foregoing shall supercede any
inconsistent representations made by Enron in any agreements between Enron and such customer.

Louise,

I took a meeting with this guy from Bloomberg at Whalley's request.  Attached is Bloomberg's idea to set up a power trading company/platform in Europe.  They would want us to commit trades in exchange for equity.  I am not interested in the equity, but I told them I would distribute the idea to the proper people.  It is also being floated around the London office.  If you want, you can respond to this guy directly or I can take care of it.

Has anyone given any thought to the potential Enron NYSE delisting date relative to the date when the NETCo deal might be announced?

I think there might be some "spin" implications.

Once we have a buyer, subject to their approval, I would like to offer Broker Client contracts to the existing Brokers, with the first x months free with no obligation to continue (but hopefully they will, and will pay us). I think this will help us to rebuild volumes.

Please let me know if you disagree.

Mark Taylor and Brad Richter discussed this Friday and Brad and I will stay on top of it with Mark and Richard Sanders.  Pickering checked with Webb and he felt it was probably without merit.

Just spoke to Mark Taylor.  He is having a copy of the lawsuit sent down to you.  Richard Sanders, our litigator will handle this case.  Mark's and Richard's initial opinion based on a quick review is that it's not a big deal.

Hi everyone - in spite of today's terrible news,   Rahil reminded me that tomorrow is EOL's 2nd birthday so I wanted to take the opportunity to congratulate everyone from the 'original' skeleton crew (though I know I've missed many people - apologies).   We are so incredibly close to 1 trillion in notional revs. -- $944 bn or so last time I checked -- that it's even more frustrating to see the company going down the tubes when this should really be a time of massive celebration.  In any event, congratulations to all of you, it's been a privilege working alongside all of you, and more importantly, becoming friends with you.  I hope some of us get a chance to work together again going forward, but regardless, please stay in touch all of you whatever happens next, and make sure you track me down if you are planning to be in Toronto at any point as well.

Same data by counterparty, also showing percentage today versus last-two-week average, is in the enclosed spreadsheet.  Most counterparties are at or near typical rate.  Many of the larger counterparties are trading at a faster pace (Aquilla, Dynegy, Reliant in particular).  AEP, Calpine, Cinergy Marketing, Sempra and Mirant are at least 50% off their typical pace, particularly AEP and Calpine.

Have we thought of letting traders access EOL via WAP or having a more friendly format for hand held devices,  Thereby keeping more eyeballs and keeping ourselves as the platform of choice due to convienience?  No more having to stop trading when at Henley or Wimbledon!

Hi Louise,

With the copy of the procedures that I gave you I think we have covered who can suspend George. However I am still trying to figure out who is responsible for determining when to shut it down. I was wondering if you know whether Greg Whalley is still going to be responsible for managing the product or has it been turned over to the crude group.

Also were you serious when you said you wanted the suspend trading button back. Thanks.

Louise,

I don't think we have much value in assigning the broker client deals. Most contracts have automatically terminated or have been terminated by the brokers on account of not having access to the submission screens.

There is very little outstanding money left in these contracts, anyway - most of them have monthly payments and those which do not are paid to only Q1 2002, anyway.

Therefore, I think there is little value in pursuing assignment of these and I recommend we instead pursue new contracts (at the appropriate time), perhaps with the first few months free to soothe any bad feelings on their part.

Do you agree?

Dave

Bob Shults and I will be attending an eNYMEX reception this Thursday, and John and Greg are still trying to coordinate a meeting with Bo and Vincent.  Short answer-- we've got it as covered as possible for now.  

Another item:  I got a call from Stephen Thome in ENA who wanted us to post something like an advertisement for your turbines on EnronOnline.  Jay confirmed that it was technically feasible to craft a pop-up that targets certain customers with information and links to documents and spec sheets.  I'm told we have resisted this approach in the past because it has the potential to get out of hand once the genie gets out of the bottle, so to speak.  I think it fits well for the turbines, but I wanted to make sure you were behind this idea before we launched into development.

I am assuming that Greg Piper is going to handle this - you may want to talk to John Arnold as he has some good ideas for a deal with Nymex.

I would be happy to meet with them so feel free to set something up.  We have had contact in the past with NYMEX on some of these issues and I can explain the story later.

My asistant is Tina Spiller and I am in next week (I am in London this week) so maybe we can get together and discuss.

thanks.

I recently met Robert "Bo" Collins, the new President of the NYMEX and formerly with El Paso. Bo is keenly aware that the NYMEX has fallen down in two areas--first, catering too much to the locals, while ignoring their true customer base and secondly, not following through with the eNYMEX rollout. Bo along with Vincent Viola, the new Chairman of the NYMEX are dedicated to correcting these two problems immediately. Personally, I think there is a chance that EnronOnline could partner with the NYMEX and it could benefit both. Obviously, they need us far more than we need them, but there is a window of opportunity due to the recent change in the NYMEX management. Is this something of interest and if so, should we follow up? Bo and Vince will be in Houston in late August for a NYMEX cocktail party at ROCC and I could arrange a meeting at Enron.

Louise--

In response to some considerable concern voiced by Presto, we are re-evaluating our Broker Client relationships.  I'm planning to send the following email to each of the desk heads.  It is intended primarily to generate feedback from the desks, but my ultimate plan is to shut down the relationships and essentially start over with the desks making the transaction decisions instead of EOL.  Before I launched it, I wanted to get your thoughts.

Thanks,
Brad



Earlier this year, Enron executed deals with certain Broker's which allows the broker to execute transactions for their clients via a Broker Client which is linked to the EnronOnline platform.  All executions done on Broker Client are free of brokerage charges.  To date, about 80% of the 3,400 broker trades executed on-line have been in the US Power segment.  The companies that have access to read and execute transactions using the Broker Client are as follows:

APB Energy, Inc. (Canadian Nat Gas, Canadian Power, US Nat Gas, US Power, US Coal, US Emissions, US Weather, US Crude, US Bandwidth)
Natsource LLC (US Nat Gas, US Power, Canadian Nat Gas, US Coal, US Emissions)
Amerex Natural Gas I, Ltd. (Asian Crude, Bandwidth, US Crude, US Nat Gas, Belgian Nat Gas, Canadian Nat Gas, European Crude)
Amerex Power, Ltd. (Australian Power, Austrian Power, Bandwidth, Canadian Power, Dutch Power, German Power, Nordic Power, Spanish Power, Swiss Power, UK Power, US Power)
Power Merchants Group, LLC (US Financial Nat Gas)
Prebon Energy, Inc. (US Nat Gas, Canadian Nat Gas, US Power, Canadian Power, US Coal, US Emissions, US Crude)
Prebon Marshall Yamane (UK) Ltd (UK Gas, UK Power, Continental Power, Continental Gas, European Crude, European Weather, Asian Weather, Asian Crude, European Bandwidth)
Natsource Tullett Europe Limited (UK Nat Gas, UK Power, Continental Gas, Continental Power, European Coal)
GFI EnergyNet LLC (US Nat Gas, US Power, Canadian Gas, Canadian Power)
TFS Energy, LLC (US Nat Gas, US Power, Canadian Nat Gas, Canadian Power, US Bandwidth)

A significant concern has been raised that these relationships have amounted to a free option on the part of the brokers, who will transact with Enron on long-dated product only if they can't find an equal or better price from a supplier who will pay brokerage.  While I am confident that this possibility was discussed when the deals were struck, the current situation calls for some changes.  Accordingly, our plan would be to exercise our right to shut down all Broker Clients immediately.  As a result, we would be forced to return approximately $1.2 MM in fees paid by the brokers listed above.

Let me be clear that this does not preclude future Broker Client arrangements.  The decision to engage in future deals should be made on a commodity-by-commodity and region-by-region basis.  In other words, we can grant access to whichever product types the desks feel comfortable with.  If particular desks have broker relationships that they would like to move on-line in support of their market, the technology and resources are available to make this happen.  What we are currently seeking is simply a reset on the Broker Client product so that we are not employing a "one-size-fits-all" solution.

I would welcome your thoughts and comments on this course of action before we decide to proceed.

Thanks,
Brad Richter

Hi Mark, Barbara,

Can we work something out with AEP whereby we don't change the online GTC for sometime? We do have language in the Product Long Description that adresses the sale of HPL. Is there any other way we can allay AEP's concern that counterparties logging onto EnronOnline are confused about the actual ownership of HPL. Thanks.

Savita

Let's also check Lavo on this. He wanted to voice his opinion at the end before we do anything.

I think Whalley might have an opinion too but let's decide as ENW and EA first.

Thanks.

Subject:	Broker Client

Louise--

In response to some considerable concern voiced by Presto, we are re-evaluating our Broker Client relationships.  I'm planning to send the following email to each of the desk heads.  It is intended primarily to generate feedback from the desks, but my ultimate plan is to shut down the relationships and essentially start over with the desks making the transaction decisions instead of EOL.  Before I launched it, I wanted to get your thoughts.

Thanks,
Brad



Earlier this year, Enron executed deals with certain Broker's which allows the broker to execute transactions for their clients via a Broker Client which is linked to the EnronOnline platform.  All executions done on Broker Client are free of brokerage charges.  To date, about 80% of the 3,400 broker trades executed on-line have been in the US Power segment.  The companies that have access to read and execute transactions using the Broker Client are as follows:

APB Energy, Inc. (Canadian Nat Gas, Canadian Power, US Nat Gas, US Power, US Coal, US Emissions, US Weather, US Crude, US Bandwidth)
Natsource LLC (US Nat Gas, US Power, Canadian Nat Gas, US Coal, US Emissions)
Amerex Natural Gas I, Ltd. (Asian Crude, Bandwidth, US Crude, US Nat Gas, Belgian Nat Gas, Canadian Nat Gas, European Crude)
Amerex Power, Ltd. (Australian Power, Austrian Power, Bandwidth, Canadian Power, Dutch Power, German Power, Nordic Power, Spanish Power, Swiss Power, UK Power, US Power)
Power Merchants Group, LLC (US Financial Nat Gas)
Prebon Energy, Inc. (US Nat Gas, Canadian Nat Gas, US Power, Canadian Power, US Coal, US Emissions, US Crude)
Prebon Marshall Yamane (UK) Ltd (UK Gas, UK Power, Continental Power, Continental Gas, European Crude, European Weather, Asian Weather, Asian Crude, European Bandwidth)
Natsource Tullett Europe Limited (UK Nat Gas, UK Power, Continental Gas, Continental Power, European Coal)
GFI EnergyNet LLC (US Nat Gas, US Power, Canadian Gas, Canadian Power)
TFS Energy, LLC (US Nat Gas, US Power, Canadian Nat Gas, Canadian Power, US Bandwidth)

A significant concern has been raised that these relationships have amounted to a free option on the part of the brokers, who will transact with Enron on long-dated product only if they can't find an equal or better price from a supplier who will pay brokerage.  While I am confident that this possibility was discussed when the deals were struck, the current situation calls for some changes.  Accordingly, our plan would be to exercise our right to shut down all Broker Clients immediately.  As a result, we would be forced to return approximately $1.2 MM in fees paid by the brokers listed above.

Let me be clear that this does not preclude future Broker Client arrangements.  The decision to engage in future deals should be made on a commodity-by-commodity and region-by-region basis.  In other words, we can grant access to whichever product types the desks feel comfortable with.  If particular desks have broker relationships that they would like to move on-line in support of their market, the technology and resources are available to make this happen.  What we are currently seeking is simply a reset on the Broker Client product so that we are not employing a "one-size-fits-all" solution.

I would welcome your thoughts and comments on this course of action before we decide to proceed.

Thanks,
Brad Richter

In these troubled times, it's nice to get a blast of good news.  Check out Swerzbin's EOL from today.  He set a personal best of 130 transactions totalling 1.3 million MWhs.  I guess he can do it if he wants to.

EnronOnline started to see message delivery slow down drastically at 8:40am.  At 8:50 updates were so slow that all products were suspended from trading.  At 8:56 we brought the site offline to insure that trading would NOT continue, as our traders could not manage their products.

At 9:10 we were able to isolate the issue to a single disk, in a brick of storage, that was responding extremely slowly, but not failing over like it should.  We removed the storage from the configuration and brought the database back online.  Once we verified the database was healthy we brought EOL back online at approximately 9:28am.  At this point all our users, both internal and external, started logging back in.

The issue was caused by a bug in the firmware on the disk.  The vendor of the disk has already provided us with a patch for this bug.  We will be applying this patch to all of our storage, one brick at a time starting this evening.

We had to take EOL offline for a second time at 11:17am due to a failure on another brick of storage.  This failure was caused while we were verifying the root cause of the issue we experienced earlier.  We brought the site back online at 11:56.  During this outage we verified that there was NO corruption or loss of data, due to either of the outages.

Regards,
Bob Hillier

I hope you are having fun.  Tom

Dave,
 
I first want to thank you for extending to me the opportunity to come back to Enron and with you.   Dave, your offer is very tempting, however, I have decide that it would be best that I search elsewhere for new employment.  
 
If I may ask you, I would very much appreciate if I can give your name as a professional reference during my job search and if you can write me a letter of reference to help me along with my search.  If so, I will be ever so grateful.  Once, again thank you.  
 
I wish you and Avril warm and Happy Holidays.
 
Sincerely,
 
Lydia Cannon

Has Tobias shown us who is backing him and how much money he can get?  We still need to, in parallel, deal with the business units on if they will support it through an allocation processs in 2002.
 
Thanks.

Don--
 
Since Tobias Munk is no longer an employee of Enron as of last week, please direct all correspondance concerning DealBench to either me or Ross Mesquita.  We will then contact potential purchasers or investors at the appropriate time.  As you know, we are currently formulating our plans for the platform and we would appreciate any input you have to that end.  If you have any questions, please feel free to give me a call.  Thanks in advance for your help on this.

Hi Don, 

the investment climate out there is very harsh, as you probably know. For me to raise VC money I need to show client business.

If you could confirm to me on a non-binding basis that Enron Americas is looking to continue to use DealBench datarooms and that a platform lease of a substantial value could be reached, that would help me a great deal in the process. Please feel free to amend in any way you feel fit and be as specific or unspecific as you see appropriate.

Please reply to my Enron e-mail as well as my private e-mail 

tobiasmunk@yahoo.com 

Thanks very much and I will be in touch (after the quarter and your successful divestitures :-) 

Tobias Munk

How about this for the banner on EOL
 
All posted prices are read only. If you are interested in discussing a possible transaction, contact the Enron trading desk.  Please be advised that Enron Corp. and other subsidiaries of Enron have made filings under Chapter 11 of  federal bankruptcy laws.
 
After further consideration, I think it is important to make clear (1) that we will not automatically agree to the trade if a counterparty calls and (2)  that Enron has filed for bankruptcy protection.

Louise -- Here's a draft of the answer for this guy (David Zaccour).  I didn't get to spend a lot of time on it.  This should give him some good stuff to combine with his own research.  If you think we need to give him more, please let me know.

Subject:	MBA Question for Louise

Liz,

	I work for Anthony Dayao as part of the EES IT group but formerly was in Enron Net Works under Steve Stock and met Louise briefly in 1999.  I'm in the middle of the Rice University Executive MBA program and for one of our final exam questions, we are permitted to consult internal resources.  The question is regarding how we (Enron)  have used the Internet to differentiate ourselves from other organizations (Competitors) in the industry.  During our Rice MBA classes, EOL was brought up several times so it's considered very highly by the school.  I would be remiss if I didn't mention its strengths during our exam.

	My professor has provided me assurance in writing (Email) that any answer will not be published.

	I appreciate Louise' and your time in helping me on this school exam paper.

	Regards,
	David Zaccour

Exam Question:

2.	Working with whomever you deem is appropriate in your organization, identify the three organizations in your industry, which in your opinion, use the Internet and World Wide Web the best.

If your organization is not one of the top three, what does it need to do on the Internet and World Wide Web to move to the "best" category? If your organization is among the top three organizations in your industry, what uses of the Internet and World Wide Web have differentiated your organization from other organizations in your industry?

Formal approval no, but your opinion matters for sure.
 
We will move forward and be ready before the analyst meeting in January (assuming there is one at the regularly scheduled time).
 
Brad is working with PR to make sure anything we do on that side is appropriate as well.

To be honest, I really do not think my sign off on this.  
 
It looks like the money is already mostly spent on the new design (I like it if that helps) - if you get delayed there obviously will be timing issues.  The added functionality is definitely something beneficial which we want whichever the outcome is.

I would like to move forward with what we are calling Phase III for EOL.  Most of the work is done but in this environment, I don't want to prepare to roll it out in January without your views.  However, if we are to roll it out in mid-January, we need to agree soon.
 
Richter has sent you the outline/presentation on e-mail and he and Savita and Jay can describe it all in greater detail if you like. 
 
Savita discussed the presentation and the plan with John Arnold and he is supportive of the rollout and the new look and functionality. 
 
Basically it will include a new home page and a new garden page, but the key parts are the expanded quotes screen and the order manager which are a much better use of real estate than the static Reuters content down the side (which will be put in a MyContent button).  This isn't expensive, most of the work is done anyway, but it is a new look and the quotes screen will now be expanded.
 
I think it would be positive to do.  It looks better, the Reuters content can be found in a MyContent button and we can use the entire quotes screen to enhance order flow and improve the counterparty experience.  It also shows business as usual with EnronOnline.
 
Your thoughts?

I am running out to my daughter's school, but I think we are done.

Jay Webb is fine with the new set up with Savita reporting to me on a temporary basis and Brad working to get ready to take the job like Andy used to have it and the reporting going to Brad eventually.  I think he is actually relieved and really wants to focus on building a larger career in technology and Pickering is very supportive of giving Jay a larger ENW role in eCommerce. Jay is also committed to signing a new contract.

Savita is talking to Jay right now and if that goes OK, Savita is done as well.  I told Jay that I was doing this so there should not be any issues.  Jay told me he would absolutely support Savita as he did when Andy was in charge.  She is ready to support the deal until year end and help me hire and train the next wave of EOL folks as well as get Brad ready.

Richter is committed as well.  He feels the origination part is tactical and a short run project and wants to run the system like Andy used to.

Savita will get with me tomorrow first thing and I think seal it.  We all want to wait until next week when Pickering is here to make it public knowledge.

Have no idea if EGM knows any of this.

Your thoughts?

Louise,

- It has come to my attention that some groups (back office) have been told that each individual within their group can elect to be part of the Estate or of NewCo. This is surprising to me. No such election has been offered to anyone in EnronOnline (nor do I think it would make sense to offer that), but before I tell people they do not have a choice, I wanted to check with you.  - ?

- On the issue of bonuses: The numbers we put together made sense to me in the context of an annual  bonus with some element of retention mixed in. According to the auctions documents I looked at, retention is identified as being for a 1 year period, with 1/2 of the amount paid up front and 1/2 one year later. If this is the case, it significantly changes the complexion (i.e. more like a retention payment with an element of bonus, rather than bonus with an element of retention) and we should revisit the numbers.

Dave

Louise did look at this, but she's not involved in EOL anymore.  The new head of EOL is Jay Webb and he's over here next week.  I'll ask him whether it's still on the agenda.

Have we thought of letting traders access EOL via WAP or having a more friendly format for hand held devices,  Thereby keeping more eyeballs and keeping ourselves as the platform of choice due to convienience?  No more having to stop trading when at Henley or Wimbledon!

Louise,

Just wanted to let you know that the account for C. Fradas has been created and the pages have been customized for US Gas and Power.  Furthermore, I have tried to reach Christopher twice but have not been able to do so. I have left him a voice mail with his ID and Password. Also, we are monitoring his ID to see if he logs in.

Let me know if you have any questions,

UPDATE 1-EnronOnline energy e-trade resumes after halt.

08/09/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Aug 9 (Reuters) - EnronOnline, the Internet arm of energy marketing
and trading giant Enron Corp. , said Thursday that trade in its online energy
products was resuming after a brief halt at about 10 a.m. EDT (1400 GMT).

"Most people should be able to log on now. We've been slowly bringing it
back," a company spokesman told Reuters.
He said the cause of the outage was still not known.

With an average of $3.5 billion in trades every day, EnronOnline enjoys the
highest volume of all energy electronic platforms.

The company posts bids and offers for a variety of energy products, including
crude oil, heating oil, gasoline, natural gas and electricity.

Enron Corp. is the No. 1 natural gas and electricity marketer in the United
States, and about 60 percent of its transactions are captured through the
electronic platform.

Savita,

 As we have discussed, when Enron sold HPL to AEP, Enron specifically agreed that all rights to the name "Houston Pipe Line Company" as of June 1,2001, were the sole property of AEP/HPL and that no Enron Entity would use that name.
 On or about the first of June, the EOL Long Product descriptions were modified to provide that notwithstanding that the GTC's for physical natural gas provided that all Enron transactions in Texas were to be deemed HPL transactions, that such language was overridden by the Long Product description.
Notwithstanding this modification to the Long Product description, AEP is claiming that the continued use by EOL in EOL's GTC's violates the Purchase and Sale Agreement and impinges on its trademark "HPL".  As we discussed last week, we have  received a letter from AEP threatening a lawsuit if we do not immediately remove the references to HPL from the EOL GTC's.

Based on what has been happening in the past several days, I completely concur that we should not require that any EOL Counterparty "re-accept" the physical natural gas GTC's in order to trade with ENRON.

I advise that we either (i) do nothing and risk being sued by AEP, or (ii) that we forget about making any other "cleanup" changes requested by Stacy and merely notify the applicable Counterparties that as evidenced by the Long Product description for physical natural gas transactions, all such transactions will continue to be with Enron, not HPL, and that the EOL GTC will be modified as of [date] to eliminate any reference to HPL.

I would suggest that this notification be done as innocuously as possible....such as on the remittance statements in/on our checks to these Counterparties or on our invoices.  We should not ask any Counterparty to sign or return anything to reflect this, nor should we request any reacceptance of out EOL GTC .

You have inquired as to the possibility of getting AEP to enter into an agreement with Enron to not change our online GTC at this time.  Frankly, at the present time the relationship between Enron and AEP is quite antagonistic..... we have several matters pending which need to be resolved.......in order to reach some type of agreement with them regarding use of the HPL name we would need to "make it worth their while"..... and due to some of the positions Enron is currently taking, AEP would probably refuse to enter into any such side agreement with or without costly concessions . 

Thus, as I stated earlier, we should either "do nothing" and wait for the lawsuit....or go the "innocuous notice" route.

I have spoken with Mark Taylor and he concurs that under the current circumstances, these are preferable routes to the POP-Up and reacceptance  route which had been in the works for the past few months.

Please fell free to call me with any questions or comments.  If we decide to go the "notification route", I will promptly draft the exact language to be used.

Best Regards
Barbara

Hi Mark, Barbara,

Can we work something out with AEP whereby we don't change the online GTC for sometime? We do have language in the Product Long Description that adresses the sale of HPL. Is there any other way we can allay AEP's concern that counterparties logging onto EnronOnline are confused about the actual ownership of HPL. Thanks.

Savita

Market Forces - ENymex still on launchpad.

09/07/2001
Energy Compass
(c) 2001 Energy Intelligence Group. All rights reserved

The New York Mercantile Exchange has been thinking about shifting some of its
business online since early last year - - and possibly before that - when it
was invited to join the electronic IntercontinentalExchange (ICE). It rejected
the offer - which rival International Petroleum Exchange has since gladly
accepted - instead unveiling plans last May to build its own electronic
trading platform for over-the-counter and smaller futures contracts. But its
cyberspace initiative is still on the launchpad.

Called eNymex, the online system was supposed to launch in October 2000, at
the same time as the Big Oil-backed ICE. But October came and went, and while
ICE appeared, eNymex failed to show. Its start date was pushed back to late
2000 - and then to the first quarter of 2001, and then to the second quarter
of this year. Nymex held to that second-quarter target for months, before
again failing to deliver. It's now given up on the third quarter as well, and
exchange executives have stopped trying to predict when the electronic trading
platform will be ready to go.
That's not the only blow to Nymex's e-trade strategy. Delays are also plaguing
an internet version of its existing Access after-hours electronic trading
system, although it remains available as a proprietary, dial-up system to
existing customers.

Late last month, Nymex announced plans to make Access available over the
internet - at www.nymexaccess.com - in a move designed to widen its customer
base. But just a few days before the planned Sep. 3 start date, the exchange
pulled back (EC Aug.31,p3). As with eNymex, a new date has yet to be
scheduled. Launched in 1993, the dial-up version of Access handled 2.1 million
contracts last year, equal to 2% of Nymex's total trading volume. Nymex
executives say that putting Access on the web could triple the volume of
business completed on the platform. The exchange's new Brent crude oil futures
contract and other existing pit-traded contracts are available on Access.

Compared with ICE - which is steadily unveiling new services and products on
its e-trade system - the New York exchange's path to building an electronic
platform has been bumpy. Earlier this year, Nymex ended its relationship with
Accenture (formerly Andersen Consulting), which had been involved in managing
the exchange's transition to an electronic trading platform almost from the
start. Some observers characterized the move as a cost-cutting measure; Nymex
says Accenture was dismissed because its work was done.

Nymex blames many of the delays on GlobalView Software, one of its technology
partners, with which it is involved in a bitter legal dispute. In April, Nymex
filed a breach of contract lawsuit in a New York court against GlobalView,
alleging that the Chicago-based software firm had stopped work on eNymex, and
seeking unspecified damages. GlobalView chief executive Jon Olson admits that
his company did indeed stop work, but says it was because Nymex stopped
paying. It is countersuing, seeking around $26 million for fees and damages.
Nymex president Bo Collins is also claiming that GlobalView has gone bankrupt.
But Olson says business is good for the 20-year-old company, which has around
150 clients in the energy industry.

With GlobalView off the project, Nymex has decided it will build the
"front-end" piece of eNymex - the part that GlobalView was working on.

When it's all complete, Nymex will have an e-trade platform for derivatives
and smaller futures contracts, and a separate e-trade service for its
after-hours customers. It will also have its existing pit-traded contracts,
which it has no intention of ditching.

With so many different pieces, some observers wonder what Nymex is up to.
Collins, a one-time natural gas trader at US-based El Paso, responds that
Nymex aims to build an "electronic cloud" around its successful pit contracts.
Rather than disrupt a successful business, Collins says the exchange is
creating new, electronic trading opportunities around its pit-traded products.

"The reality is we have a system of pit trading that provides immense
liquidity to the market," he says. "So I have got to figure out a way to marry
the technology to the humanness of the process."

For example, Nymex's Henry Hub natural gas futures contract is successful, and
several types of contracts trade on other exchanges based on the Henry Hub
price. That's where eNymex will come in, Collins says: The e-trade platform
will offer spread and basis swaps contracts based on prices of Nymex's pit
contracts - thus marrying technology and the trading pit.

Some observers suggest that the eNymex roll-out has taken a back seat to the
exchange's newest product, a Brent crude oil futures contract challenging the
IPE. The new contract, which started trading on Sep. 5, was joined the
following day by a new Brent options contract. On Sep. 7, the New York
exchange started offering a Brent-WTI spread options contract.

The battle for the hearts and minds of Brent traders will rage in the
traditional trading pits of New York and London for another year, at least.
But over the next 12-18 months, all of the IPE's business will be shifted
online to a futures trading platform being built by ICE.

The IPE's strategy is clear. By agreeing to be acquired by ICE, the London
exchange obviously sees a future where commodities trading takes place in
cyberspace - not in a trading pit. Nymex is betting that its "electronic
cloud" strategy - whereby e-trade is married with pit trading - will pay off.

In the end, though, the e-trade versus pit trade battle being waged by the
world's two biggest oil futures exchanges may become secondary to the battle
for Brent. If Nymex can create liquidity in its new Brent contract, its bumpy
path toward e-trade may be forgotten.

Hi Louise,

I told Jay about this yesterday and so you may have heard from him already but I wanted to make sure you knew that the metals deal count has gone up from an average of about 450 per day to aproximately 1200 per. I see J Aaron and EDF Mann being the primary counterparties doing the trading.

I am assuming that Greg Piper is going to handle this - you may want to talk to John Arnold as he has some good ideas for a deal with Nymex.

I would be happy to meet with them so feel free to set something up.  We have had contact in the past with NYMEX on some of these issues and I can explain the story later.

My asistant is Tina Spiller and I am in next week (I am in London this week) so maybe we can get together and discuss.

thanks.

I recently met Robert "Bo" Collins, the new President of the NYMEX and formerly with El Paso. Bo is keenly aware that the NYMEX has fallen down in two areas--first, catering too much to the locals, while ignoring their true customer base and secondly, not following through with the eNYMEX rollout. Bo along with Vincent Viola, the new Chairman of the NYMEX are dedicated to correcting these two problems immediately. Personally, I think there is a chance that EnronOnline could partner with the NYMEX and it could benefit both. Obviously, they need us far more than we need them, but there is a window of opportunity due to the recent change in the NYMEX management. Is this something of interest and if so, should we follow up? Bo and Vince will be in Houston in late August for a NYMEX cocktail party at ROCC and I could arrange a meeting at Enron.

Louise,

Subject to final legal confirmation, it looks like I will need to terminate the Participation Agreement with BPUB by Dec. 31, or Enron could be obligated to proceed with building the HVDC tie. 

>From what you know about the potential purchaser/s, Is there any point in my negotiating an extension of this date, or should I simply terminate?

Please advise.

Thanks,

Dave

Louise -- Can I respond to Deloitte with the following or would you like me to break out top four (Gas, Power, Crude/Products, Metals)?
 
"Mike -- The most popular commodities on EnronOnline are consistently energy and metals.  For competitive reasons, we do not disclose transaction volume information for EnronOnline commodities.  Please call or e-mail me if you have any other questions."

Kal, 

I'm following up on a note that David Gautschi, of Deloitte & Touche, sent to you.  I am working with David on a book about B2B.  David wanted to see if we could get some detailed information from you about Enron Online.  Would it be possible to get information about the top five products traded?  In a period of a week, what are the top five products traded?  How many transactions do they account for during that period and what is the total transactional value of those trades?

I appreciate your assistance with this.  If you need to reach me to get clarification, please give me a call at the number listed below.

Thanks, 

Mike

First of all, thanks for doing all the things nobody will ever know about over the last two weeks that saved our company.

Second, I need to get your OK on our designs for Phase 3 so we can go to production in the next few days.  The increased functionality and screen changes are important, and the look and feel re-design is low cost.  We need some good news for our customers anyway.  The attached presentation shows what it will look like and details some of the changes.  

Let me know what you think and hang in there, Louise.

Brad

Hi Louise,
	We've made some great headway with the agency in terms of concepts for the new look of EnronOnline.  We have one week left to lock down the design before we start building it and I would love to take a few minutes to show you the designs.  Would you happen to have some time this week to go over the concepts? 

Take care,
Heather Alon

How do you feel about offering clearing services on EOL?  It would be a tricky cash issue for Enron, but given our credit situation, it might become more necessary in order to keep large counterparties on the site.  Our discussions with Nymex have touched on the idea, and I wanted to get your thoughts.

Brad

Enymex slowed by Access Internet launch

08/29/2001

  It looks to be another four to six months before NYMEX launches its
electronic trading platform enymex, designed to provide a neutral
trading platform for traditionally over-the-counter products. The delay
comes in part as NYMEX begins offering its after-hours Access electronic
trading system via the Internet next week.

  The introduction of Access to the Internet poses some new questions
for NYMEX, especially how it will integrate Access with enymex, NYMEX's
Nachamah Jacobovits explained. The two platforms will remain separate,
but the idea is to allow easy trading between the two, she noted.
  NYMEX had to delay an anticipated second-quarter launch for enymex
this year after canceling a contract with a software provider that was
developing the link between the order matching system and screen layout
for the new platform. The exchange has been working with the remaining
software vendors and staff to complete the platform.

  As it stands now, enymex would offer a variety of gas swap contracts
related to the Henry Hub and other pricing points, as well as crude oil,
heating oil and gasoline calendar swaps.

  Enymex promises to be a neutral, open trading platform without
counterparty credit risk, offering standardized basis products tied to
the exchange's most liquid benchmark products. Its development was first
announced in May 2000.                                             SGS

I've expanded the counterparty list to all those that typically do more than 50 trades per day.  Additionally, liquid power products have been added in.  One final note:  on the previous spreadsheet, the position under a particular column indicated the starting position for that day rather than the ending position for that day.  In this version, each number represents the end-of-day position for the given date.  Effectively, all the numbers slide over 1 column.

EnronOnline/NetCoOnline status update:

- "NetCoOnline" will be distinct from EnronOnline, with much the same functionality and a refreshed look.

- We will carry data to support the same gas and power products as were on EnronOnline. Please contact us if you will need different products from what was on EnronOnline.

- We have prepared a list of top customers in CDN and US Gas and Power (copy attached), which we will be using as a guide in chasing signed Password Applications.

- To speed the registration process, top customers will be preloaded into the system for activation as soon as we receive their Password Application. 

- We are intending to use a simple, online GTC, which can be superceded by a negotiated Master Agreement, as with EnronOnline.

- Internal trader names have been circulated to each desk head for approval.

Subject:	Re-start/Integration Planning

We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integration Plans for Netco.  So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Several plans are in the final stages of completion including:-

+	Infrastructure		Jenny Rub
+	Development		Jay Webb
+	EnronOnline		Webb / Forster
+	HR			David Oxley
+	Cash Management	Tom Myers
+	Credit			Debbie Brackett

The rest will be completed shortly.

We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans "Re-start/Integration"  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually.

Customer Side	
+	Customers		Phase  1 - First Week (eg top 10)
				Phase  2 - First Month (eg top 50)
				Phase  3 - First Quarter (eg top 100)
+	Action Plan		Phase  1 Customers
				Phase  2 Customers

Greg mentioned today that you had asked about Paul Goddard and his continuing interest in Canada.  I've been offering Paul the chance to do much more outward-facing commercial work digging into things like Huberator and PowerITS (from this morning's articles) as well as any potential sales of our platform technology in Europe.  He expresses keen interest, but his heart seems to be in Canada.  He has committed to come to some career conclusions within the next week or two.

We've also been speaking with Heather Kendall, a director who works for Gary Hickerson in London helping to roll-up the Ag business.  I've worked with her before, and she would be great for EnronOnline's efforts at gaining traction in new products, marketing and origination out of London.  Her issue is wanting to come back to Houston at some point.  I suppose I need your help in 2 ways.  First, if you know Heather and are comfortable nudging her toward our shop, I think it would go a long way.  Second, if you are familiar with anyone else in London with deep Enron background and broad commercial shoulders who's looking for an open lane, we need to talk to them.  Clearly Paul and Lara are doing a great job, but we need even more firepower over there to iron out some of the issues the desks are facing, both internally and externally.

Thanks in advance for any help you can offer,
Brad

Version 2 - with Kal's input as well:

EnronOnline is currently not available.		

Enron is working to sell its trading and E-Commerce expertise to a strong, highly rated company by January 10. Shortly after deal closure, the new company is expected to launch a new, dedicated website for North American Gas and Power.

We will provide more information on this site as it becomes available. Please check back for future updates.

OK - here's the sort of thing I am thinking of (still needs Kal's magic).

I suspect you were thinking of a pop-up notice. Given that we aren't really showing anything on EnronOnline at the moment, I suggest we take down EnronOnline entirely and replace it with a splash page which says something like the following:


					COMING SOON

Enron is working with potential industry partners to assemble a new venture which will combine Enron's trading and market - making expertise with the financial strength and reliability of an A rated entity.

Upon formation of this new company, we anticipate that we will be able to announce the launch of a new trading platform for North American gas and power, providing services similar to those previously available on EnronOnline.

Please check back with this site for future updates on plans for the new trading platform.

I've been spending a fair bit of time sitting with the troops, sharing information with them, getting a sense of the mood and basically just trying to be visible, accessible and supportive. I think for the most part, people are trying to give us time for things to settle out, while trying also to ensure they have an escape route in case things go pear-shaped.
 
Kal and Heather were both out last Friday and will be out until Wednesday, so we have not done anything yet to modify the designs. I did send them both an email on the subject, though, so we should be on the case on Wednesday. 
 
Christmas was great - thanks for asking. We had a quiet Christmas with just the two of us. I repainted the helicopter (have pictures, if you're interested).
 
Have you been having a good visit with your Mom and Dad? Hopefully you've been able to put this place out of your mind when you go home. . .
 
Dave

We just need people to give us a week.  Surely they'll give us that long.
 
How are the new designs coming?
 
Did you and Avril have a nice Christmas - I am trying to reconnect my UK cell phone - I have been on the phone for 1 and half hours.

Jennifer doesn't know it yet, but when I submitted final numbers to HR, I kept her suggested increases and did not apply her suggested decreases (which she did to balance the increases).
 
I expect we are going to lose some people. I hope the ones that go are not the best ones. Obviously, the more we are willing to spend in bonus, the fewer the people we will lose. 
 
When would you like to get together to discuss?
 
Dave

Louise,
I am sorry to bother you at such a critical time, because I know you are doing everything you can to salvage the remaining pieces at Enron and are working long & tiresome hours to achieve this difficult matter. 
However, I felt like I had to at least let you know my thoughts on the following.
 
Dave Forster & I met a couple of weeks ago on his initiative to discuss the proposed retention bonuses for my group. I was asked to review the preliminary numbers by individual. I was allowed to move dollars but NOT allowed to increase the total dollar figure for my group. Frankly, the numbers seemed pretty low. 
 
Assuming the goal is to retain key employees for Netco, I am not confident these numbers will achieve this. 
I know several people in my group are interviewing outside of the company. I have asked them to be patient, not make any quick decisions, and give us a chance to see this through.
 
Dave told me the figures were based on mid year evaluations. As you know, mid year evaluations are typically lower than year end. The mid year evaluation allows the employee time to improve in order to get to the desired level by year end. I understand the need for a reference point of some sort and mid year was the latest figure available. However, because the retention numbers were based on this, they are significantly lower.
 
My intentions are not to show any disrepect to Dave by discussing this with you but I wanted to make sure my thoughts /opinions were communicated to you. If Dave has already discussed this with you, I apologize for the duplication. 
 
If you have any questions, please feel free to call me. I am on holiday & will be traveling today but can be reached on my cell at 713-446-9669.
 
Thank you for your time.
Jennifer

Hi Louise,

I was wondering when you would be comfortable with us changing the GTC. Apparently AEP is threatning us with breach of contract if we don't remove the language right away. Thanks.

Amy Fitzpatrick sent me a list and asked me to estimate bonus numbers for EOL employees destined for Netco.  I'd like to talk to you before I work on this.

Calling it an error is unfair.  I am not prepared to offer her AND her husband a job by Friday.  She concedes that her role on the power side may be project-like and therefore short-term.  I will keep in touch with her and open the door later.  London is being freaky about people finding homes ASAP, and it doesn't match my timeframe.

As I said in the note of yesterday - I have no interest in having the meeting. My assistant is away so its just a  misunderstanding.   See yesterday's note, we are going in on Monday.

I think losing Amita is a  major error.  There are no other candidates in the organisation with her expertise apart from Zipper, Forster and Savita.  

Thanks

I saw that our Friday meeting got rescheduled until next week, after your budget meeting with OOC.  I'd be interested to know what number you'll be assuming from EOL in those discussions.  I got your email, by the way... we're putting a little more thought into it than that.

Also, Amita is going to accept a project job with UK power.  She needs an answer by Friday on her and her husband's jobs.  Having not spoken to any other candidates but her at this point, I can't commit that soon.  We'll keep in touch with her on the off chance that her power job is short term and she still wants to come to Houston.

Stacey and Ellen:

	In light of current circumstances, if a counterparty has both a Master Firm and a GISB, please confirm all firm physical transactions (both telephonic and EOL) under the Master Firm and not the GISB.

	Additionally, could one of you provide me a list of EOL counterparties who have a GISB contract listed as their master agreement for EOL.

Thanks,

Jeff

Hello 

I know Kal is moving on to pastures new, I am sure both of you continue will to do the outstanding work you have done working with Kal without him.  With him leaving you both jump up one level.  Brad is a good guy so get to know him and see how it works out - I'm sure it will.  If you have any problems come and see me and I'll get Kal back! (joke!) but seriously my door is always open for a chat.

Hi Louise,

Attached is the Q3 2000 vs. Q3 2001 information you requested. Since we are only two weeks into Q3, though, we have included the month of June as well to get a better set of numbers. Just let me know if this is what you need.

Thanks,
Torrey

Hi Louise, 

I have a comparison for the first two weeks of Q3.  It is still so early, of course, that it is hard to say much.  We are going to add June to this to make it a little more meaningful.  But this is the Q3 stuff alone.

Thanks!

This story appeared in Bloomberg today.  It's true that we were served today.  Based on Vance Meyer's (PR) conversation with legal, our current media response is that we don't comment on litigation.  Mark Taylor, Richard Sanders, Travis McCullaugh and an attorney from V&E are working on the matter.  I will follow up when I know more.

Enron Accused of Infringing Patent for Electronic Trading

Enron Accused of Infringing Patent for Electronic Trading

     Marshall, Texas, Sept. 21 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the
largest energy trader, and its online unit are accused in a
lawsuit of infringing a Texas company's patent for an electronic
trading system.

     Bid/Ask LLC of Baird, Texas, formerly called Auction Source
LLC, said it is the sole rights owner of a patent issued in May
2000 for a ``Real-time Network Exchange with Seller Specified
Exchange Parameters and Interactive Seller Participation.''

     Houston-based Enron and its EnronOnline unit are improperly
using that patented technology through its Internet-based
electronic trading facility, according to the lawsuit filed Sept.
17 in federal court in Marshall, Texas. Enron trades commodities
such as natural gas and electricity on that trading network.

     Bid/Ask seeks a court order blocking Enron from infringing
the patent, and is asking for damages.

     EnronOnline began trading electricity and natural gas in
November 1999. Between then and the second quarter of 2001, it's
handled more than 1 million transactions valued at more than $685
billion, the company has said.

     Enron, which also trades space on fiber-optic networks, coal,
paper and other commodities, had net income of $979 million on
revenue of $100.8 billion in 2000.

     An official with Enron couldn't immediately be reached for
comment.

     Shares of Enron rose 13 cents to $28.52 in midafternoon
trading.

Louise,

Since our conversation today, I have discovered that by terminating the Reuters contract, we will lose the entire Headline News category, as well as the Stock Quotes, Sports News and Weather News.

Reuters costs over $80,000 per month. This pushes the cost of content for NewCo to over $360,000 for relatively little benefit.

Therefore, contrary to what we agreed earlier, I would like to drop all of the content on the right side of the quotes screen. We will adjust screen size or insert graphics accordingly to get things looking right until our Phase 3 expansion.

Please advise if you agree.

Dave

Do the innocuouss route and send them a letter stating you will change it at the next available/scheduled GTC change would be my suggestion.

Also just to confirm no GTC  changes on anything for the near future.

Subject: RE: GTC Change for removal of HPL language


Savita,

 As we have discussed, when Enron sold HPL to AEP, Enron specifically agreed that all rights to the name "Houston Pipe Line Company" as of June 1,2001, were the sole property of AEP/HPL and that no Enron Entity would use that name.
 On or about the first of June, the EOL Long Product descriptions were modified to provide that notwithstanding that the GTC's for physical natural gas provided that all Enron transactions in Texas were to be deemed HPL transactions, that such language was overridden by the Long Product description.
Notwithstanding this modification to the Long Product description, AEP is claiming that the continued use by EOL in EOL's GTC's violates the Purchase and Sale Agreement and impinges on its trademark "HPL".  As we discussed last week, we have  received a letter from AEP threatening a lawsuit if we do not immediately remove the references to HPL from the EOL GTC's.

Based on what has been happening in the past several days, I completely concur that we should not require that any EOL Counterparty "re-accept" the physical natural gas GTC's in order to trade with ENRON.

I advise that we either (i) do nothing and risk being sued by AEP, or (ii) that we forget about making any other "cleanup" changes requested by Stacy and merely notify the applicable Counterparties that as evidenced by the Long Product description for physical natural gas transactions, all such transactions will continue to be with Enron, not HPL, and that the EOL GTC will be modified as of [date] to eliminate any reference to HPL.

I would suggest that this notification be done as innocuously as possible....such as on the remittance statements in/on our checks to these Counterparties or on our invoices.  We should not ask any Counterparty to sign or return anything to reflect this, nor should we request any reacceptance of out EOL GTC .

You have inquired as to the possibility of getting AEP to enter into an agreement with Enron to not change our online GTC at this time.  Frankly, at the present time the relationship between Enron and AEP is quite antagonistic..... we have several matters pending which need to be resolved.......in order to reach some type of agreement with them regarding use of the HPL name we would need to "make it worth their while"..... and due to some of the positions Enron is currently taking, AEP would probably refuse to enter into any such side agreement with or without costly concessions . 

Thus, as I stated earlier, we should either "do nothing" and wait for the lawsuit....or go the "innocuous notice" route.

I have spoken with Mark Taylor and he concurs that under the current circumstances, these are preferable routes to the POP-Up and reacceptance  route which had been in the works for the past few months.

Please fell free to call me with any questions or comments.  If we decide to go the "notification route", I will promptly draft the exact language to be used.

Best Regards
Barbara

Hi Mark, Barbara,

Can we work something out with AEP whereby we don't change the online GTC for sometime? We do have language in the Product Long Description that adresses the sale of HPL. Is there any other way we can allay AEP's concern that counterparties logging onto EnronOnline are confused about the actual ownership of HPL. Thanks.

Savita

Don--
 
Since Tobias Munk is no longer an employee of Enron as of last week, please direct all correspondance concerning DealBench to either me or Ross Mesquita.  We will then contact potential purchasers or investors at the appropriate time.  As you know, we are currently formulating our plans for the platform and we would appreciate any input you have to that end.  If you have any questions, please feel free to give me a call.  Thanks in advance for your help on this.

Hi Don, 

the investment climate out there is very harsh, as you probably know. For me to raise VC money I need to show client business.

If you could confirm to me on a non-binding basis that Enron Americas is looking to continue to use DealBench datarooms and that a platform lease of a substantial value could be reached, that would help me a great deal in the process. Please feel free to amend in any way you feel fit and be as specific or unspecific as you see appropriate.

Please reply to my Enron e-mail as well as my private e-mail 

tobiasmunk@yahoo.com 

Thanks very much and I will be in touch (after the quarter and your successful divestitures :-) 

Tobias Munk

The old Andrew Hasuman meeting - it happens to all of us.

We have proabably had 20 meetings with this guy.  Believe me we should not waste our time, we did pursue Europe in the discussions too.
If you want further details ring Andy.

Thanks anyway,

Louise,

I took a meeting with this guy from Bloomberg at Whalley's request.  Attached is Bloomberg's idea to set up a power trading company/platform in Europe.  They would want us to commit trades in exchange for equity.  I am not interested in the equity, but I told them I would distribute the idea to the proper people.  It is also being floated around the London office.  If you want, you can respond to this guy directly or I can take care of it.
