Time is not on the side of SoCal right now.  Sources suggest they need some form of MOU to pass at least one chamber of the California legislature in order to show at least a  little momentum to creditors.  The legislature appears commited to closing the session for a one month recess on Thursday night and is currently sorting through three bailout plans and the state budget.  Senate Republicans appear to remain opposed to all three bailout plans, meaning that at best, any bailout plan would pass on a non-emergency basis with a 90 day delay for implementation.

Call if you have questions.

1.	AB82xx and AB83xx--Dueling Bailouts

Expect another lively day in California.  Two bills will be heard in committee at 10am Sacramento time--AB82xx and AB83xx.  AB82xx we tipped you about on Friday--the 80 page "tough medicine" bill for SoCal sponsored by Speaker Hertzberg.  AB83xx is sponsored by Rod Wright, Chairman of the Utility committee and a moderate Republican Keith Richman.  AB83xx is much more generous to SoCal and indeed Wright calls it a "straight bailout with nothing hidden."

2.	Budget Bill and Imminent Legislative Recess Could Sidetrack Both Bills
On top of this dynamic is the Budget Bill and the State Senate. According to my contacts, Senator Burton, the Senate President, is hoping to keep the published schedule and adjourn for a month's recess on Thursday evening. Speaker Hertzberg is reportedly not thrilled with leaving until the Edison issue is resolved. But talk is that once they recess, whether on Thursday or not, they plan to adjourn the Second Extraordinary session, meaning all xx bills passed and signed will go into effect in 90 days, and all others will be dead. 
As for the Budget, it is unlikely that Sen. Burton will recess the Senate on Thursday unless the Senate passes the budget that the Assembly passed last night. However a key Democrat, Sen. Sheila Kuehl, is in Italy and she has a 16 hour flight to return. No one knows if she has been told to return yet. Her vote is crucial to passage of the Budget, though, and she will be needed if they take that bill up tomorrow or Thursday. 
3.	A Third MOU Proposal?
Also, the Sen. Byron Sher proposal for Edison has still not been seen in print, but most people expect it to appear tomorrow, so the Senate can vote on it tomorrow or Thursday. It is likely to receive a waiver to hold an impromptu Senate Energy Committee hearing off the Floor on the , since no Energy committee hearing has been scheduled. This is the proposal that Sen. Burton has said he favors and is seen as the least like a bailout of any current proposals. 
4.	"Price Manipulation" Committee to Meet Today
The one Senate committee that is scheduled to meet tomorrow is the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market - at 9:30 AM -- which is scheduled to review compliance with subpoenas for Duke, Reliant, AES, NRG and Williams. (Interestingly, the hearing notice does not mention Enron, which the committee charged with contempt.)

What people know:

Hertzberg (et al's) bill (82XX)was heard in an "informational" hearing today and still sits in the Assembly Energy Committee.  It will be heard again tomorrow (perhaps beginning at 10 AM) , at which time parties will have a chance to support/oppose and ask for amendments.  Most, including us, oppose unless significantly amended.
The Wright (D) -Richman (R) bill (83XX)was heard in an "informational" hearing today and still sits in the Assembly Energy Committee.  It will be heard again tomorrow, at which time parties will have a chance to support/oppose and ask for amendments.  From our perspective, this is the best bill out there yet, though it still has serious problems---it isn't available electronically yet, but should be tomorrow, and I'll distribute then.  The chances of the joint D-R bill being successful are slim, however, since it's up against the Speakers competing bill.  There is talk that the Speaker will try to negotiate with Wright/Richman tonight and include any agreement in his bill (82XX).
The original version of the Governor's MOU bill sits in the Senate.  Most believe that Burton will put it up for a vote this week and it will fail.
The Senate's version of the MOU (Sher-Peace-Kuehl) (78XX)came out today.  It will likely be heard in the committee tomorrow or the next day.  Notably, it kills Direct Access completely and makes Edison shareholders responsible for that portion of Edison's debt owed to suppliers.  In short, a very bad bill.
Burton's 18XX, which would de-link the bond issuance (to pay back the General Fund) from the DWR contracts is likely to pass the Senate tomorrow or the next day.  Many--including Enron--support the bill (though we are supporting it behind the scenes).

What people don't know:
Whether there's the time or the will in the Assembly and Senate to achieve by Friday a single, comprehensive bill that can be sent to the governor for his signature. 
Whether the Legislature would postpone its month-long recess if the Legislature hasn't finished a bill by Friday (most folks think they will not postpone).
Whether it's true that, irrespective of the energy issue, the Legislature will fail to get the budget completed by Friday and therefore have to postpone their recess anyway, in which case they might continue to work on the energy legislation at the same time.

Odds-makers still say it's better than 50-50 that the Legislature does not get the Edison bills done by Friday and leaves on on its 30-day vacation.

Best,
Jeff

Sacramento is one goofy place.

Senator Burton spoke with the Speaker  Wednesday  night and urged him not to convene an Assembly session during the scheduled recess, since the Senate is not going to interrupt their vacation. Burton's request, in conjunction with the Speaker's trouble in getting enough of his members to return on their own dime (he didn't want the Assembly to pay for people to fly back from European vacations for 48 hours - and few members were willing to pay for it themselves), means there will probably not be a hearing on Hertzberg's Edison bailout plan tomorrow.
Since Hertzberg plan is different from the bill the Senate passed, Burton wants Hertzberg to include the Senate in discussions on a solution that can get passed in both houses. Since  there is not expected to be any hearing on any bills/Edison bailout before both houses return from the summer recess on August 20th - we look  for negotiations to occur on extending the MOU's Aug 15th deadline.


 State of the Negotiations-- Issues to Be Covered 

Below are the current provisions Keeley and Hertzberg are wanting to pass into legislation (when they return from recess).  Currently, they are not sure if all of these amendments would be wrapped up into one bill or if they would just amend bill SB78XX while introducing a new bill SB_XX.  Working under the assumption that they would amend bill 78XX and introduce a new one, the following issues are a reflection of their current positions.  If they decide to introduce one new bill than the issues below would be included into one piece of legislation.  Please remember, these issues are only their current thoughts and are such to change.  There are important differences in the proposals with significant implications for a SoCal voluntary filing--these include whether to include a bond bailout; conservation easement; a rate-payer benefit account; neither bill offers a transmission line purchase or any kind of trust to assist SoCal. 

SoCal Debt
SB _XX
No provision for debt.
SB 78XX (amended)
Approximately $2.9B through corporate bond financing supported by a Dedicated Rate Component (DRC) over a period of time sufficient to pay the bonds (10-15 years).  Final debt amount to be established by the PUC and the State Auditor.

Core vs. Non-Core
SB _XX
For purposes of paying the SoCal debt, creates a Core program for consumers with a peak demand of less than ?Kw and Non-Core customers of ?Kw or more.  They would share in the cost of SoCal debt retirement: (1) all consumers share pro rata for the first two years, (2) Non-Core pay 100% after two years.
SB 78XX(amended)
No Provisions.

Transmission System Purchase
SB _XX and SB 78XX
No purchase of transmission assets.

Conservation Easements
SB _XX
No conservation easements.
SB 78XX(amended)
Specific conservation easements and other land arrangements described in bill for about 24,000 acres per the Governor's MOU.

Direct Access
SB _XX
Removes regulatory constraints on a Direct Access program effective January 1, 2002 and permits customers to buy power if there is a net short after SoCal native generation, bilateral contracts, and DWR contracts.  Residential and small commercial customers may use direct access from renewable energy sources.
SB 78XX(amended)
No provisions for Direct Access.

Ratepayer Benefit Account
SB _XX
Deposits in the account any refunds or net cash resulting from (a) any refunds ordered by FERC or from litigation, and (b) any positive DWR Power Fund revenues; all to be refunded to ratepayers through either bill credits or rate reductions in proportion to the March, 2001 PUC rate increase.
SB 78XX(amended)
Does not create a Ratepayer Benefit Account.

Electric Supplier Claims Settlement Trust
SB _XX and SB 78XX
Does not create a Trust or trustee to negotiate reductions.

Renewable Energy
SB _XX
Creates a Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) to achieve a target of 10% of all new generating capacity additions through 2010 and overall 20% of statewide total generating capacity by 2010.  Munis have been exempted from the RPS.
SB 78XX(amended)
No provisions for renewable energy.

*. The state budget passed the Assembly last night at approximately 6:55 p.m. PDT.  The MOU hearing, which was supposed to take place following the budget debate, was cancelled due to the late hour.  The Senate is on call to take up the budget (SB 739 [Peace]).  There are rumors that Senator Burton will not accept the large amount of pork put into the budget by the Assembly.  The budget must pass both houses before the legislature can adjourn, so it takes priority over the MOU.

*. The Senate Energy Committee is on call of the chair (Bowen) to discuss the original MOU, sponsored by Polanco.  This is expected to happen sometime today.

*. An Assembly vote on AB 82XX is likely to occur in its floor session on Wednesday or Thursday.  An Assembly floor session is scheduled for Friday on the call of the Speaker.

*. Two Republican votes are now needed to pass any urgency measure or the budget on the Senate side because Senator Kuehl (Dem) has gone on vacation to Italy.  Sen. Perata (Dem) may also go on vacation shortly, meaning that 3 Republican votes would be needed.

Please forward to others who need this information.

As you know, Enron's been involved with a group of business customers, small customers, labor and enviros trying to hammer out a core/noncore proposal that would act as a key modification to Edison's MOU with the Governor.

Today, the Assembly leadership released a bill (AB 82XX) that modifies the MOU but does not follow the core/noncore proposal negotiated by the group.  The bill just came out, is about 80 pages long, and thorough analysis has not yet been completed.  The URL for the bill is attached.  Based on a meeting attended this morning in Sacramento,the key features of the bill( which is attached) are:

Direct Access suspended until 1.1.2003 (suspension presumably effective on the effective date of the bill)
Transmission sale at 2X book.
Approximately 90% (or greater) of Edison's undercollection absorbed by customers 20KW and above.
Create a Trust to address the money owed to the generators and offer the generators 70 cents on the dollar (but does not do away with the suits, investigations, etc.)
The bill is completely silent regarding who will pay for the DWR contracts and what the payment structure will look like.

Reaction and Timetable
Very chaotic, with considerable uncertainty about where (if anywhere) the bill will go, leaving many to believe that bankruptcy remains a strong possibility.
Business customers (and of course Enron) are strongly opposed
Republicans are strongly opposed
Labor has big problems with the Tx sale unless they get assurances that TX labor jobs are guaranteed, which is not yet included in the bill
We are working with business to remove the Direct Access suspension
We are also working on the Senate side to attempt to get the Senate to include Direct Access in their version of the modified MOU, but the Senate has been more hostile than the Assembly to Direct Access.
Senate Democrats still intend to run a bill that delinks payment of the bonds to repay General Fund for power already purchased from the DWR contracts. AB82XX does not address this issue.
Senate Democrats also intend to craft their own version of a "modified MOU."  Word is that the Senate will release their bond language and their "modified" MOU this weekend or early next week.
The Assembly will hold an "informational" hearing on the bill tomorrow (Saturday) to get members up to speed
The Assembly will have a committee hearing and vote on the bill on Monday, with the intent of sending the bill to the full Assembly for a vote on Tuesday.
The Legsilature is supposed to have a month-long recess beginning Friday, July 20th, which requires that both the budget and the energy issue get resolved by then, or suspend the recess and continue working

Will continue to provide updates as events unfold. If folks have additional comments on the bill, please direct them to Harry Kingerski and Leslie Lawner, who will ensure that they get into the hands of our lobbyists in Sacramento.

If there are any questions, my pager is 888.916.7184.

Best,
Jeff

Senate approves Edison rescue deal, Assembly measure stalled
By Jennifer Coleman 
Associated Press Writer 
SACRAMENTO (AP) -- The state Senate approved a bill that significantly alters the plan negotiated by Gov. Gray Davis to help the struggling utility Southern California Edison. 
The bill approved Friday, authored by Democratic Sens. Richard Polanco and Byron Sher, lets Edison issue $2.5 billion in revenue bonds to pay debts amassed when prices for wholesale electricity reached record-high levels in the last year. 
"I believe it's a measure that gets us to the goal of getting the state out of the business of buying electricity ... and to bring this entity to creditworthiness," said Polanco, D-Los Angeles. 
Approved 22-17, the bill now goes to the Assembly. The Assembly adjourned Friday night without voting on a similar measure. 
The Polanco-Sher plan shifts the burden of repaying the bonds to commercial and industrial power users and has been opposed by business interests and by Edison, which says it won't help the company escape bankruptcy. 
Davis' plan, announced in April, offers Edison $2.76 billion for its transmission system and lets it sell revenue bonds to repay the rest of its estimated $3.5 billion worth of debt generated when it had to pay skyrocketing wholesale power prices. 
Under the plan by Polanco, and Sher, of Stanford, the state has a five-year option to buy Edison's grid. 
That, said Republican Sen. Ross Johnson of Irvine, gives Edison a bailout it "neither needs nor deserves. 
"I am tired of this projection of Edison as a victim. They have their legion of lobbyists here telling us ad nauseam that they didn't support deregulation," Johnson said during floor debate. "The idea of Edison as the victim goes down in the annals of real whoppers. Edison paid their lobbyists bonuses for the successful passage of deregulation." 
During the 1995-1996 deliberations that led to deregulation, Edison officials helped create the current system in meetings with business interests and then-Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican. 
Lawmakers are set to go on summer break Friday night until Aug. 20, a schedule that conflicts with the deadline in the Memorandum of Understanding between Davis and Edison. That says the Legislature must approve the deal by Aug. 15. 
"It's a firm deadline, which means this issue has to be fully resolved prior to the end of the legislative recess," Davis said Friday. 
For that to happen, either the Senate bill or a proposal by Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, and Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, has to reach Davis. 
"I have problems with both bills," Davis said. "I am heartened by the fact that there's a bill moving in each house." 
The Keeley-Hertzberg plan trims at least $300 million from the governor's offer. It also allows Edison to issue the bonds, which would be repaid by Edison ratepayers over 10 years. 
The plan also attempts to increase the state's use of "green" energy resources and allow Edison customers to opt for cheaper direct-access energy service. 
The Assembly didn't vote on the Keeley bill Friday, because Hertzberg is considering forming a working group with the Senate and the administration to "iron out the bills' differences," said Hertzberg's spokesman Paul Hefner. 
Davis said he wanted any working group to continue working over the summer break to devise a compromise by the Aug. 15 deadline. 
"I don't want people to go out fishing for 30 days and come back and worry about it on Aug. 20 because I know we're going to have reapportionment and other major issues to deal with in that last month," the governor said.

The Bond Legislation
The Democrats in the Assembly and Sentate have agreed to language to create a Dedicated Rate Component to repay the budget and de-link the bonds from the DWR contracts. 
But the Republicans have still not agreed to go along.  
The bill would require a 2/3's vote to keep the bond issuance on schedule, so Republican votes are necessary. 
The Republicans are trying to meet tonite or tomorrow to determine whether to go along.

The Conference Committee
Senator Burton does not like the idea of a conference committee and at this point prefers to use the existing committee structure to hear the core/noncore proposal.
Using the existing committee structure could take longer to produce a bill than using the conference committee structure, but how much longer is uncertain.
No sense yet of when hearings on the core/noncore proposal---in conference committee or otherwise--will take place, though Burton continues to say that he wants to "give it a chance."

The Core/Noncore Legislative Language
The negotiating group continues to work on the language.
The language was supposed to be delivered to Hertzberg by COB today, but more work needs to be done and it is now scheduled to be delivered first thing tomorrow morning.

Senator Dunn's Investigative Committee Hearing
The hearing's been moved from tomorrow to Wednesday.

Best,
Jeff

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
?	More Revenue Bonds Sought in California
?      MOU Developments

BONDS

State Controller Kathleen Connell has requested $5.7 billion in revenue anticipation bonds with a term of one year or less.  These bonds do not require legislative approval; there does exist blanket legislative authority to issue them, and they have been issued in previous years when there has not been a budget surplus.  They are considered a fairly routine instrument and would be secured against the general revenues of the state.  However, while this is theoretically not the same revenue stream as the larger revenue bond issuance, in reality these bonds will likely (if issued) be repaid with the proceeds from the revenue bonds.  

It is not surprising that Connell made this request (rather than Angelides), given that she is frequently seen as "off the reservation."  Connell is clearly concerned about cash flow problems in the General Fund and wants to repay it as quickly as possible.  Whether she really needs $5.7 billion to do this is debatable.

The real signal that Connell is sending here is that she has no confidence that the larger revenue bond issuance will take place in a timely manner.  Specifically, there is growing concern in Sacramento regarding the utilities' court challenges to the PUC and DWR and the impact they may have on the revenue bonds' ability to sell.  These court actions (and the associated appeals) could be a serious barrier to the larger revenue bond issuance, which now will likely take place in October at the earliest.

While Connell is seen as a "difficult" person, she is not seen as irresponsible; her "demand-request" (as Angelides described it) has not provoked outrage in Sacramento, meaning that others share her concern about the need to pay back the general fund in a timely manner.

The bonds requested by Connell will likely somewhat dilute the market for the larger revenue bond issuance, in that they will be sold on the California tax-exempt bond market.

MOU Developments

The legislature still appears to be no closer to putting together a modified MOU that will pass both houses and bailout SoCal.  Now that the transmission asset sale has been dropped on the Assembly side, there will be no "hot dog for the dollar," which is what the Senate (and Burton in particular) has advocated.  With nothing tangible given in return for the bailout, the Senate will be even more unlikely to pass an Assembly bailout.  This is commonly known as a "legislative lob"; one side passes something it knows the other side will reject.

Since the legislature recessed, two things have become apparent to observers: 1) The wrong deals were made earlier in the crisis to secure power.  Things were rushed, and the state is now paying the price.  2) Corruption and conflicts of interest exist in the crisis, particularly on the governor's side.  Some parties involved stand to benefit from bailing out SoCal.

Both of these issues will likely serve to signal legislators to slow down and carefully consider any move they make when they return from recess, regardless of pressures put on them by the utilities or the governor's office.

SoCal hopes that AB82xx at least passes the Assembly this week so it gets into Conference Committee prior to the recess.  Even though the current form of the bill is unfavorable, SoCal believes that if they can get the bill into conference committee, then "anything can happen" and more favorable terms could be restored.  At a minimum, the bill buys time.  As such, the Senate vote may not be as critical for SoCal and its creditors as long as the bill passes the Assembly.

The following points highlight legal/regulatory recommendations to the business team on the DA suspension issue.

All intelligence indicates that the CPUC will act on this issue at its June 28, 2001 meeting (and there are sufficient votes for the decision).
Existing Contracts - It is our recommendation that EES should submit any and all DASRs to initiate DA service  to the appropriate Utility no later than June 29, 2001 for all customers that have existing contracts if we want to ensure DA service.
New Contracts - All new contracts should be signed by both EES and the customer no later than June 30, 2001 (July 1, 2001 is a Sunday).  DASRs for these contracts should be submitted to the appropriate Utility as soon as possible, but in no event later than July 6, 2001.  The July 6 date is our estimate of the last date the Utility would accept DASRs for new contracts.  It is important to note that the CPUC is keeping the clock on contract execution timing.
Switching Option - Customers that are on DA service can be returned to the Utility per the tariff process.  Once the customer has been returned to Utility service after July 1, 2001, our expectation is that there will be no ability to have this customer receive DA service in a future timeframe.  In addition, returning to Utility service may incur a "re-entry fee".
Contract Extensions - EES should consider amending all current contracts that terminate after July 1, 2001 with a Evergreen Provision that provides for Index pricing with 30 day cancellation notice provisions.  These amendments should be signed prior to June 30, 2001.  It is possible that the CPUC will require marketers to detail the termination dates of their DA customers.  One additional thought - EES may consider having the customer assign any Negative CTC receivable to EES as compensation for the Evergreen provision (to overcome the CPUC language that indicates that the customer is due the Negative CTC credit).

We intend to set up a call for 5pm Houston time today to discuss (call-in number to follow).

The train wreck known as California utility crisis continues along.  Democrats are turning on one another in the aftermath of the Assembly's failure to pass a SoCal bailout plan.  Meanwhile, talk of direct access is threatening to undercut the PUC's ability to hike rates, Davis' plans to issue bonds for a SoCal bailout, and the California state budget.

RJ

1.	Bryson and Davis Moving To Unseat Burton

There is a serious effort currently underway in California to unseat Senator Burton (D-San Francisco), President Pro Tem.   Even though the chances of this happening are relatively low, John Bryson, CEO of SoCal, with the support of the Governor, are making huge efforts to oust Burton and replace him with one of two potential candidates - Richard Alarcon (D-San Fernando Valley), Majority Whip or Sheila Kuehl (D-Los Angeles).  Alarcon has already stated that he would not accept the position.  However, at minimum, Bryson, Governor Davis and/or other Senators hope that Burton will rethink his position on the MOU and a SoCal bailout.

2.	Direct Access Talk a Serious Problem for SoCal and California Budget

Additionally, behind the scenes, things are looking very grim for California due the implications of Direct Access.  "Direct access," or the right of large companies and municipalities to buy power directly in the wholesale market, is fast emerging as a new and serious issue that could make a rescue of SoCal more difficult. It could also complicate existing state plans for the California electricity market and the proposed municipal bond sale, well placed Sacramento sources tell us. 
The biggest opponent of Direct Access comes from the Governor's office as they realize the potential effects of direct access and how it could undermine the revenue stream supporting the bond issuance for SoCal.

For those interested in more on Direct Access keep reading:

Trying to stop municipalities from opting out of the state power plans will be extremely difficult, as it runs against some of the most entrenched and long-standing privileges in California politics. Under California law, it is very difficult to stop many cities doing what they please. Most older and larger cities are "charter cities" rather than "general law cities" subject to the California Municipal code. Under the California Constitution, charter cities can "pretty much do anything or provide any service short of printing money and raising an army," says one source. The League of California cities - a weighty organization representing every one of California's cities - is already swinging into action to support direct access. Most Assembly Democrats started out as City councillors and have some sympathy with local independence. And the resistance within the Assembly is already building against Hertzberg's attempts to stop even large companies getting direct access. 

Some city leaders will not wish to fight the Governor and the state legislature on the issue. But if municipalities do not opt out, they may have to explain to their local business and voters why they are paying far more for electricity than a city next door which chooses to set up its own power company. Cities are beginning to realize they might potentially lose major employers. Politicians are also beginning to realize that local companies stand to gain or lose a fortune on the matter, and this could affect campaign contributions. 

State power plans at risk

If municipalities do move to set up their own power companies, it could undermine at least three key elements of the State of California's power plans: 
?	First, the rate hike already approved falls mostly on businesses and other large users. But municipal power would unpick this structure, allow large regions of California to ignore the PUC, leaving the rate structure to be determined city by city. Many municipalities may be unable to resist pressure from local businesses to protect them from disproportionate rate hikes. Others might cave into irate voters; 
?	Second, the plans laid out by Governor Davis' and State Treasurer Angelides' for a California State Public Power Authority would also be badly damaged if large regions avoid having anything to do with it. "It is possible that long-term power contracts might also face an additional hurdle if municipalities opt out of higher long-term rates by buying on the open market," one source says. "It could mean the state is left with excess power that it would have to sell at a loss;" 
?	Third, revenues to back the proposed power bonds could be imperilled, if municipalities opt out of the rate structure and revenue stream needed to repay the bond. And if the momentum for direct access develops among the cities and municipalities across the state, it could make it much more difficult to launch the bond in the first place as investors may take fright at potential threats to the viability of repayments. 

The issue is at an early stage -- the PUC had a general workshop on the matter at its offices in San Francisco on Friday. So far, the matter has been seen as a micro technical issue rather than as one of the biggest hurdles the state will have to face. State legislative leaders are likely to use every political and legal means available to stop municipal secession, or at least smother the issue until the power bond is successfully away. But stopping the municipalities if they choose to follow this path could prove to be difficult

The Southeast RTO orders are out and have followed through with what we exp=
ected from the discussion at the FERC meeting.

The SPP and Entergy RTO proposals have been rejected because they fail to s=
atisfy the scope and configuration requirements of Order No. 2000.  The Com=
mission  notes that the required discussions between SPP and Entergy and it=
s neighboring RTO/TOs has led to no increase in the original scope and conf=
iguration.  The filings by SPP and Entergy were brief, indicating only a la=
ck of interest by other RTOs or utilities in joining to enlarge scope; they=
 failed to specify any details of the talks, what changes could be made or =
what could be fixed to accomodate combination with other RTOs.  The order s=
tates that the Commission favors the development of large, regional transmi=
ssion organizations reflecting natural markets.  The Commission indicates t=
hat they favor four RTOs - NE, SE, MW and West.  Therefore the order requir=
es the participants in SPP and Entergy to participate in settlement discuss=
ions as set out in the mediation order.  Note that these meetings will star=
t next Tuesday, July 17 before a FERC ALJ.

The Southern Company RTO is also found by the FERC to fail the scope charac=
teristics of Order No. 2000.  The order finds that Southern's approach to f=
ocus on MOUs and seams issues with its neighbors is inadequate.  The order =
states, "We reiterate: the Commission's goal is to have a single RTO in the=
 Southeast, and to have that single RTO operational as soon as possible."  =
The Commission recognizes that start-up costs in forming a larger RTO may b=
e more, but that over the longer term, large RTOs will foster market develo=
pment, will provide increased reliability and will result in lower wholesal=
e electricity prices.  The order therefore directs the parties to the media=
tion as stated above.

The Grid South participants are also directed to the mediation which is sta=
rting on next Tuesday.  It is a lengthier order with more details on other =
aspects of RTOs, including Independent Board requirement, congestion managm=
ent, interconnection procedures, planning process and CBM.  Therefore, I am=
 attaching a summary of the order.  One of the important findings of the or=
der is that GridSouth is not sufficiently independent; the Applicant TOs ar=
e making policy decisions that should be made by an independent board.  The=
refore, the order requires GridSouth to install an independent board and fi=
le a compliance filing within 90 days.

If anyone wants copies of the orders, let me know.

Below is a brief summary of the main issues regarding Direct Access.  We wi=
ll continue to follow the progress on these issues and keep you updated.=20

Summary:
Direct access was designed to break utility monopolies and was a key compon=
ent of California's 1996 deregulation law.  Under this concept, all custome=
rs could directly access an energy provider other than their regulated util=
ity.  The debate over direct access is at the heart of a complicated attemp=
t to solve California's costly power crisis.  It will determine whether bus=
inesses, with residential customers, pay for the bulk of the state's future=
 energy purchases. It also could determine whether Southern California Edis=
on, the state's cash-strapped No. 2 utility, will avoid bankruptcy, and whe=
ther deregulation will survive in any form.

Report:

Big businesses, free-market advocates and alternative energy providers have=
 lobbied state legislators to find a way to keep so-called "direct access".=
  Now, as the state prepares to sell $13.4 billion in bonds to begin paying=
 off its debt, legislators and energy officials say they must prevent big b=
usinesses from wiggling out of that obligation by closing off their direct-=
access escape route.  Regulators are concerned that if businesses flee the =
system, the state will be stuck with too much electricity under long-term e=
lectricity contracts through 2021.  That would mean residential ratepayers =
would be stuck paying the bulk of the $43 billion in future power costs, a =
point that has enraged consumer groups.  Currently, only about 88,000 custo=
mers buy their energy through direct access (per CEC statistics), including=
 about 10,000 large commercial/industrial customers, and about 78,000 resid=
ences.  Alternative service providers shifted most of their customers back =
to California's primary utility suppliers (SoCal Ed., PG&E, SDG&E) earlier =
this year when prices skyrocketed and they could no longer compete with uti=
lity rates capped by the Legislature. =20

California legislators argue that direct access is the keystone of the late=
st Edison bailout plan, sponsored by Assembly Speaker Pro Tem Keeley. Under=
 the plan, the 3,600 largest businesses would agree to pay $3.1 billion of =
Edison's debts over 15 years.  In exchange, businesses would be allowed to =
secure their own power contracts by 2003, but not without first paying an "=
exit fee."  The fees and which parties would be exempt remain undetermined,=
 however, they would include a surcharge or a complicated calculation in wh=
ich businesses would pay a percentage of future energy purchases.  It is li=
kely that whatever compromise legislators are able to reach regarding direc=
t access, California's business community will have extreme difficulty acce=
pting the terms.

To ensure their efforts at resolving the direct access dilemma and abate fe=
ars of a collapsing state budget, lawmakers have gone so far as to introduc=
e two bills, (one sponsored by Sen. Bowen and defeated in July, and a secon=
d by Assemblyman Dave Kelley,) that would rescind language in previous legi=
slation that authorized the Public Utilities Commission to block direct acc=
ess.  The California PUC has thus far stayed a decision on the matter, but =
is expected to rule by August 23rd.

Complicating the issue is Wall Street.  The state's bankers, led by J.P Mor=
gan, are nervous about selling as much as $13.4 billion in planned state bo=
nds if businesses (currently the largest ratepayers in the state, after gov=
ernments) find a way out of the system.  The bonds are meant to repay the s=
tate for $8.2 billion in power-buying costs so far this year and to cover s=
ome future costs.  Business and residential electricity customers would rep=
ay the bonds through a surcharge on their utility bills.  If businesses wer=
e allowed to sign on with outside energy providers, that revenue stream wou=
ld be in jeopardy.

Events in California take a bearish turn for SoCal but expect several more twists and turns this week, as there are other more SoCal-favorable bills still in circulation.

RJ

The former bill carrying the original MOU, SB 78XX (Polanco), has now
been gutted and replaced with what appears to be the Senate plan (crafted by Sher) for the MOU.  IN other words, the original MOU crafted by the governor and SoCal in April no longer has a bill carrying it.

*. The newly amended SB 78XX calls for the following:

- There is an option for the state to purchase SoCal's transmission assets at book value.
- Revenue from the rate stabilization bonds may be used as follows:
	- No more than $1.2 billion for bank creditors
	- No more than $1.3 billion for debts owed to QFs
	- Any debts for power purchased from non-QF generators before 1/31/01 is the responsibility of SoCal and its parent company.

*. This deal seems very likely to be seen as unacceptable by SoCal,
especially this final point.

University of California, California State University and Enron Reach Settlement Agreement 

ATTENTION: State, Business editors 

OAKLAND, Calif., July 11 (AScribe News) -- The University of California, California State University and Enron Energy Services announced today a settlement agreement that will extend their contract for two years and return the two university systems to direct access service from Enron.

As part of the agreement, UC and the CSU will drop their lawsuit against Enron and Enron will dismiss its appeal. The two university systems had brought suit in federal court seeking to retain their status as direct access Enron customers after Enron had resourced their power procurement to the Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas&Electric utility companies.

"We are delighted that our negotiations with Enron have ended with retention of the two university systems as direct access Enron customers," said Joseph P. Mullinix, UC senior vice president for business and finance.

"The California State University is pleased that we have been able to resolve our differences with Enron and retain our direct access status," said Richard P. West, CSU executive vice chancellor and chief financial officer. "This agreement means considerable savings for the universities and allows us to continue with our energy conservation efforts."

"Enron has always been a strong advocate of the benefits of direct access, and we are pleased to be able to extend our contract for two years with UC/CSU," said Marty Sunde, vice chairman, Enron Energy Services.

"Separately, with the potential elimination of direct access for California customers, Enron is once again directly serving its commercial customers in California, including UC and CSU. As more and more customers in California see the importance of managing their price risk in power markets, commercial energy users have increased interest in our product offerings."

The current four-year contract with Enron is scheduled to end on March 31, 2002. The two-year extension, approved in principle, would continue the two university systems as direct access Enron customers until March 31, 2004.

Enron and the universities will negotiate price and other terms of the extension between now and Dec. 1, 2001. Both parties have the right to terminate the extension if an agreement is not reached by Dec. 1.

The agreement covers all UC campuses and the UC Office of the President, with the exception of UCLA and UC Riverside, which have agreements with their local municipalities. All CSU campuses, except Los Angeles, Northridge, Sacramento and Stanislaus, are part of the Enron contract, as is the CSU Office of the Chancellor.

Together, UC and CSU rank as the largest single user of electricity in California. UC's systemwide peak load is 332 megawatts, and CSU's is 117 megawatts. One megawatt powers approximately 1,000 homes.

In the same Decision that the CPUC is considering voting out on suspending Direct Access, the CPUC is considering a SoCal Edison recommendation to suspend further payment of the Negative CTC to marketers.

The Decision would find that the earlier Stipulation does not require SCE to make a cash payment in lieu of a bill credit (even though SCE has already paid cash in previous periods for the Negative CTC).
The Decision orders SCE to not make cash payments to satisfy the Negative CTC credit.
The Decision is unclear as to whether or not this is simply a suspension of payment or would be permanent.
The Decision would apply the same findings and rulings to PG&E and SDG&E.

The key issue is that rather than having a cash receivable, EES would now have a bill credit receivable.  In addition, because EES re-sourced its customers, the Utility account that holds the bill credit is EES, not the customer account.  The only method to obtain the economic value of the bill credit is to utilize the Utilities' services.  Even if EES physically serves the customers going forward, it may not be the same account that has the bill credit.  

The outcome of this case would impact our current Complaint, but it is unclear exactly how the CPUC would apply this Decision to that case.

We are intending to (a) try to remove this issue from the CPUC Decision, (b) trying to clarify the suspension is not meant as a vehicle to deny us payment, and (c) trying to determine that the Utilities' tariff would allow us to be paid if our account became "inactive".

One other option to consider (at least for SCE) would be to contact SCE management to work out a bill credit application process to allow EES to route the economic value to our DA customers.  

If anyone has any questions, please call me to discuss.

Jim

This is a long one... Let me know if you have specific follow-up.

RJ   

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
California Senate's MOU Debated in State Assembly
Coordinating the California Legislature 
CPUC's Rate Setting Authority In Question
Highlights from the SoCal Investor Conference Call

MOU
As reported earlier, SB 78XX (the leading SoCal rescue adopted by the CA Senate) has undergone minor amendments by the California Assembly.  Three important revisions on the bill are:
In regard to commercial rates, the assembly has now left open the definition of large or "industrial users" by eliminating the previous 500 kWh+ usage requirement.  This change could enable the Assembly to categorize either smaller or larger consumers into the industrial/commercial user status 
The bill would not become effective unless SB 39XX is signed into law.  SB 39XX  (authored by Sen. Speier) is regarding the CPUC's authority over utilities and generators in California; it places certain generation that was purchased by Reliant, Dynegy, etc. from the utilities after deregulation under PUC authority.
The State's purchase of the SoCal Ed. transmission lines has been removed.

AB 82XX was also revised by the Assembly with many of the deleted provisions duplicate in SB 78XX, such as the conservation lands and the option to buy the transmission lines.  Additionally, AB 82XX can not be enacted unless SB 1XX (the windfall profits bill) is signed.  The joining of 78XX to SB 39XX and of 82XX to 1XX is very likely a method by which the Assembly is pressuring the governor to sign these other bills, which otherwise might not have been enrolled.  However, the joining of these bills makes their passage more difficult.  The remaining provisions of AB 82XX are as follows:
Renewables Portfolio
Direct Access
Ratepayer Refund Account (changed the name to Ratepayer Benefit Account)
Balancing Account for SCE procurement of power
DRC replaced with non-bypassable charge option for MOU.  This includes reference to balancing account, recovery of reasonable procurement costs, and the prohibition of reasonableness review on contracts by PUC.

Putting the MOU to a Vote
The Speaker feels that everything in these bills has been discussed already, so nothing is really new. Hertzberg met with advisors Wednesday night (10:00 pm) to decide if the Assembly will convene on Friday. It probably has a lot to do with the ability to get enough members' support of these measures and willingness to go back to Sacramento. Many are vacationing; some in other countries. If there is an Assembly session on Friday, he plans to have an informational hearing on the measure today.  If the Assembly's session fails to convene Friday, it is unclear what he intends to do.  On the other side of the equation, it is unlikely that Senator Burton will bring the Senate back into session to approve this bill.  The Senate won't even consider it until it comes back from recess, but the Assembly feels it is their responsibility, thereby putting the onus back on the Senate. Apparently there is really no coordination between the leadership of the different houses.
While SB 78XX and AB 82XX are the most publicized bills, neither bill will be the actual legislative vehicle for these provisions.  The proposed content of these bills will be amended into other bills which are further along in the process, thereby eliminating the need to waive a number of rules and hold numerous hearings.  This will speed up the process. Apparently the Speaker's office has not yet identified the actual bills that will be used. But they hope to find bills that are so far along in the legislative process that if the Assembly passes the bills they will not be able to be amended in the Senate.  It does appear that the Assembly does intend to send these through as two separate bills, though, with the SB 78XX provisions in one bill and the AB 82XX provisions in another.

CPUC, Rate Setting Authority or Rate Setting Minority
Recently, the California Assembly has pursued a legislative provision that would enable lawmakers to abrogate the CPUC's rate-setting authority and hand over that power to the California legislature.  Politically, this gives the Governor the ability to say, if rates increase automatically, that he did not approve of the rate increase, and there is nothing he can do about it.  But it also gives Wall Street buyers of California's revenue bonds assurances that no matter what the need, there will always be enough revenue to back revenue bonds payments; thus deniability to ratepayers and certainty for bondholders.  

Were this provision to pass, the CPUC would still retain oversight of rates for the investor owned utilities.  As for DWR, under the draft rate agreement proposed by the CPUC, it contains a mechanism for the Commission to use in setting electricity rates that satisfy DWR's "revenue requirement." DWR's revenue requirements include bond-related costs, operating costs (such as power purchase costs), and administrative costs.  AB1X provided for energy-related bonds to be sold by the state to support DWR's power purchases.  Because power contracts require DWR to pay for power before it makes bond payments, and DWR must sell power to obtain revenues, the rate-setting mechanism in the rate agreement also applies to DWR's power purchases not just its bond payments. Note that if the Commission adopts a rate agreement, it becomes irrevocable. 
-The draft agreement also includes a provision stating that the CPUC will take the DWR at its word as to its retail revenue requirements.
The agreement would require that the CPUC set rates meeting DWR's requirements in either 30 or 90 days. The 90-day mechanism applies whenever DWR submits a revenue requirement. The 30-day mechanism applies when DWR anticipates or actually draws on its reserves. 
The rate agreement includes an enforceable covenant by the CPUC specifying how the Commission will set rates to meet DWR's revenue requirements (which includes both bond costs and operating costs).  

If the CPUC's draft rate agreement is approved, there will be no legislative or PUC oversight of any of those costs, and no opportunity for public comment for as long as bonds are outstanding.  If a rate agreement can be avoided, there will be opportunities to review and alter the agreement's demand management and administrative costs.  Either way, power contract costs remain an obligation of DWR and cannot be altered except by mutual consent of DWR and the contractor.

SoCal Edison Investor Conference Call
The following are notes from the SoCal Edison conference call with holders of defaulted debt, 24 July 2001, 1:30 PDT:

In order for California to sell their revenue-bonds with an investment grade rating, two criterion must be met; 1) there must be a rate-supported, dedicated revenue stream in place and 2) the legislature must have the power to override of the CPUC's rate setting authority and raise rates if necessary.  The second criterion, however,  faces significant opposition from the California State Constitution.
Regarding the DWR rate requirement, Craver, the spokesperson for SoCal,  stated that SoCal is evaluating the numbers, particularly on the DWR side.  He stated that if you accept their output of models and numbers, it appears this requirement would fit within the existing rate structure.  However, "we need to remember that deregulation started with forecasts that proved to be wrong".  Therefore, this is "risky" in that SoCal is faced with "fixed revenues and floating costs."  Unlike DWR, SoCal has no ability to adjust rates based on costs, making floating natural gas prices a risk.
Prudential asked, if based on the Hertzberg legislation, the sale of the transmission assets is now off the table.  SoCal responded that this is correct.  Prudential asked if SoCal could then anticipate more securitization, i.e., be securitized for all but $500 million with an option to buy the transmission assets at book for 5 years.  SoCal responded that it was "unclear what the pricing [of the transmission assets] would be, but there would be an option" for the state to purchase the transmission assets.
Prudential asked about the status of the remaining (non-legislative) implementing decisions on the MOU and if the legislation (78XX and 82XX) contains them.  SoCal responded that there are 3 outstanding issues remaining for implementing the MOU:
	1) Ratemaking for the utilities' retained generation:  The PUC is holding hearings on this issue this week.  These hearings have slowed the process. A decision is expected by the end of August.
	2) A procurement plan for the utility: This plan is before the PUC.  SoCal suggested the PUC may be waiting to see what passes the legislature before acting on this point.  Regardless, the company needs an "adequate balancing account with an automatic rate trigger."
	3) Clarification on the utility holding company's position regarding 1st priority:  On this front, the PUC asserted its jurisdiction over all three utilities and their holding companies.  The three holding companies have challenged this decision.  Commissioner Bilas has written a draft decision in favor of the challenge; a final decision is expected as soon as Thursday. This would clarify that the utilities have first call on investment from the holding companies, but that the holding companies are not obligated to pay the debts of the utilities.
Deutsche Bank asked if, in SoCal's numbers reported to date, it was assuming the charges for ancillary services.  SoCal responded that DWR had confirmed as of 18 January that it would pick up these charges.  These charges would otherwise amount to $800 million - $1 billion in additional revenue requirement for the utility.  Based on FERC rulings, SoCal had not been counting on paying these charges, so they are not reflected in the company's numbers.  However, SoCal will be paying grid management and uplift charges.  They anticipate paying "some portion" of these charges.  This could potentially require an amended URG filing.
Citigroup asked where Edison stands on the Edison Mission Energy issues.  Edison responded that they are "working on new facilities on the bank side." The current facilities expire on October 10th or 11th.  Edison indicated it is in the process of finalizing sales of approximately 1,000MW of non-strategic assets.  They are in negotiations with the final bidders except for Hopewell, which is done.  There is no specific timeline on when the deals will be announced, but it is a matter of days to a week.
Appalucia Management asked if, on SoCal's generation, DWR is assuming a cost-plus or retail rate.  SoCal responded that it uses cost-of-service based rates.  The return on the 12/31/00 rate basis is approximately 4 1/2 cents.  The $72.77 stipulated covers SoCal's generation, its contracted generation, QF costs (which were quoted as the most significant portion) and uncollectables.  This is driven by gas costs for the QFs.  Revenue is fixed at $73.00.

Attached is a summary of the New York RTO Order issued by FERC late yesterday. I apologize for the length, but I wanted to include a number of quotes from the Order that repeat arguments that we have been making over the past few years. In a procedural Order issued today, FERC has scheduled the Northeast mediation process to begin next Thursday, July 19th.

Summary of the activities since Friday:

Overall, it's 50-50 or better that the Legislature will finish up the budget and recess until August 20th, without having passed some form of an "Edison MOU." Will have a better view of the chances of getting an MOU agreed to and passed through both houses by COB Monday.  

In the Senate:
The "Edison MOU":
As previously reported, on Friday, SB 78---the Senate's version of the Edison MOU--passed out of the full Senate and was sent to the full Senate.
The bill sticks 100% of suppliers' debts with Edison's shareholders but pays QFs and other creditors.
The authors believe that suppliers can't force Edison into bankruptcy because the claims are with the PX, not Edison, which in their view means that the suppliers can't reach Edison.  Our lawyers need to assess whether the tactic is strong from a legal perspective. 
The bill creates an option to buy the transmission system, but rejects the Goernor's MOU, which buys it outright.
Though there's some uncertainty, the bill appears to end Direct Access.
Information we have indicates that the Assembly does not support and will not pass SB 78 in its current form.
Enron (and the marjority of market participants) opposes 78.

The "Dunn Investigation":
Dunn released his report regarding contempt charges against Enron on Saturday.
The report recommends that the Senate fine us, beginning with $1,000 the first day, and doubling everyday thereafter until Enron "complies."
Dunn announced on Saturday that he would attempt to bring the report to the full Senate for a vote on Saturday.
In response, our lobbyist in Sacramento spoke to a leader of the Republican party in the Senate (Ross Johnson), and persuaded Johson to negotiate the date of the vote with Burton and Dunn.
She was successful---Johnson went to Burton and got him and Dunn to agree not to vote on the report until the Senate returned from its recess on August 20th.
If the Senate returns early, it could vote prior to the 20th, but the likelihood of that happening appears low at this time.

The budget:
The Senate passed the budget at about 1 AM Sunday morning.
The Senate adjourned for recess after the vote and is not expected to return until August 20th.
That leaves the Assembly alone in Sacramento to do its part regarding the budget and the Edison MOU.

The Assembly
In short, leadership within the Assembly is extremely weak and without much influence over its own party--the Democrats.  
The Speaker is viewed as having botched both the budget and the energy issue.
Unable to do a deal, the Assembly recessed Saturday night and has not reconvened. 
It has therefore not taken the votes needed to finish up with the budget.
The Assembly also has not passed its version of an Edison MOU, which it says it intends to do.
Best information we have right now is that the Assembly does not plan to go back into session until Tuesday morning.
Late Saturday night, the Assembly Speaker released yet another version of his Edison MOU (AB 82XX), but it does not appear at this time that he has enough votes among Assembly Democrats to pass it.
Enron--together with business customers--opposes the version of 82XX released on Saturday night because it does not adequately ensure Direct Access.

Best,
Jeff

FYI.  Fairly accurate account of the activities in California.   Assembly released new version of Hertzberg's bill late last night.  Another update to follow shortly.

State Senate OKs bailing out Edison from bankruptcy 
Assembly plans own version for utility 
Lynda Gledhill and Robert Salladay, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau 
Saturday, July 21, 2001 
?2001 San Francisco Chronicle  
URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/07/21/MN133267.DTL  
Sacramento -- The state Senate approved a plan yesterday to keep Southern California Edison from falling into bankruptcy, but the bill crafted as an alternative to the pact between the utility and Gov. Gray Davis faces an uncertain future. 
The bill by Democratic Sens. Richard Polanco of Los Angeles and Byron Sher of Palo Alto would give the state a five-year option to buy the utility's transmission lines and would have the state guarantee no more than $2.5 billion of the utility's debt. Edison amassed an estimated $3.5 billion in debt as wholesale electricity prices increased but retail rates remained frozen. 
The Assembly was also attempting to craft its own version of a deal last night, but political maneuvering and fears of repeating the same kind of mistakes that led to California's botched 1996 deregulation legislation haunted lawmakers. 
Davis continued to apply pressure on lawmakers to put a bill on his desk before Aug. 15, a date set in the original agreement between Davis and Edison. 
Lawmakers were scheduled to start their monthlong summer recess last night, but failure to pass the state budget meant no one was leaving town. 
"It's a firm deadline, which means this issue has to be fully resolved prior to the end of the legislative recess," Davis said of the Aug. 15 date. 
Davis suggested that a conference committee or working group could be used to iron out differences between the two bills, but it is unclear whether that could be accomplished in the next few days. 
"I have problems with both bills," Davis said. "I am heartened by the fact that there's a bill moving in each house." 
Both houses struggled to garner enough votes to get their respective bills to a floor vote, and many lawmakers indicated that they were not happy with the process. 
In the Senate, 22 Democrats voted for the Edison plan, while four Democrats and all 13 Republicans voted no. 
Sen. Jackie Speier, D-Hillsborough, said she would vote for the bill in its current form, but not if any substantial changes are made. 
"The Legislature is ill-equipped to try to craft a deal," she said. "This particular measure -- and only this one -- has the intent and clarity to protect ratepayers. I'm leery of the bill going to the Assembly and being cannibalized." 
The Senate bill authorizes Edison to issue $2.5 billion in bonds to pay off alternative energy producers and their banks. The bonds would be paid off through increased rates charged Edison's largest customers and would not cover the $1 billion Edison owes out-of-state generators. 
Edison maintains that the Senate bill will not make the company creditworthy, which would put it back in the position of buying power. 
The state has been spending upward of $50 million a day on power since January, and Davis and lawmakers want the rescue plan in place so that the utility can once again begin buying power. There is also hope that any deal would be used as a way to get Pacific Gas & Electric Co. out of bankruptcy. 
In the Assembly, two competing measures put pressure on leaders to change their bill. The rescue plan by Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg of Sherman Oaks and Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, was undergoing changes to garner more support. 
Some of the changes included eliminating the purchase of transmission lines and taking municipal utilities out of the deal. 
Assemblywoman Elaine Alquist, D-San Jose, one of the undecided members on the Edison agreement, said the original bill was too complex. 
"It's a cleaner bill," Alquist said. "I think it comes down to whether this does not affect our constituents and there is not a link to PG&E. I would say I'm tentatively satisfied." 
Alquist and other Democrats said they were concerned about the rushed nature of the Edison negotiations. Only a few members of the Assembly -- all former state senators now in the lower house -- voted to approve the 1996 legislation, AB1890, that brought deregulation to California. 
Assemblyman Joseph Simitian, D-Palo Alto, said he gave a courtesy vote to the Hertzberg-Keeley plan in the Appropriations Committee, in order to get the measure to the Assembly floor and continue debate. 
"As we've learned from the experience of AB1890, the devil is in the details. I have a lot of questions," Simitian said. "The difficulty is that very little gets done here until there is a deadline, and then once there is a deadline, too much gets done." 
Hertzberg acknowledged that some Assembly members were afraid the bill was getting rushed, but he said lawmakers are well-informed about the energy crisis and its details. He said they have had 200 hours of caucus meetings and countless hearings on the crisis. 
A wild card in the Assembly's plan was a bill by Assemblyman Rod Wright, D- Los Angeles, that garnered Republican support. The so-called "straight bailout" would give Edison its $3.5 billion through a $2-a-month fee levied on utility ratepayers. It was stuck in the Assembly Appropriations Committee.

Having failed to resolve either the budget or the energy issues, the Legislature is likely to postpone its recess and work through the weekend, at a minimum.
In sum, though many claim that the Legislature will "vote for something," it still doesn't appear that the "something" will include a measure that will keep Edison out of bankruptcy.
The Senate and Assembly remain extremely far apart in their approaches to amending the Governor's original MOU (which is dead).
The ranks of politicians that view bankruptcy as the best alternative is growing.


In the Senate:
SB18XX---Bill to de-link the bonds from the DWR Contracts
In the only bipartisan move to date, SB18XX passed out of two committees yesterday, but has not yet been voted on by the full Senate.  
The bill de-links payment of the bonds needed to backfill the state budget from payment of DWR contracts.
The bill is being driven by increasing concerns over the volume and price of the DWR contracts.
The DWR contracts are being held up as the reason California must suspend, or end, Direct Access.
Republicans on the Assembly side are supportive of 18, but Hertzberg--the Speaker--has joined with the Governor's people in the view that the bill would impair the contracts, consititute a breach, and expose the State to substantial damages.
As a result, when the bill passes the Senate and gets over to the Assembly, its chances of passage there are low.
SB72XX---The Senate's MOU
The Senate's version of the MOU--SB72XX--limped out of its final committee yesterday before going to a vote by the full Senate, but its chances of passing the full Senate at this point are 50-50.
The problem is that many democrats believe they will be attacked for voting for a bill that will likely drive Edison into bankruptcy, while many other democrats fear it will look like they bailed out Edison----the courage and leadership is awesome.

In the Assembly:
The Assembly two versions of the MOU---AB 82XX and AB 83 XX (now AB 50XX)
The Assembly is severely divided over how to address the energy issue.
The Speaker is having a very difficult time getting democrats to support his own bill (82XX).
Many moderate democrats support a bipartisan bill developed by a democrat (Rod Wright), who has broken ranks with Repbublicans, and Assembly Republicans.
In the end, the Speaker's bill is likely to prevail.
Things are complicated by the fact that the Assembly is having a very difficult time getting a budget passed.
As noted above, the Assembly democractic leadership opposes SB 18XX and is trying to cobble together an alternative to 18.

Just got a call from Hertzberg.
He pulled the plug last night on trying to get an Edison MOU finished by this weekend.
Too complicated; too rushed; he couldn't pull it off, but intends to  continue working with folks.
He said that likelihood now is that the Assembly will recess, come back on the 20th, and try again.
Since the Legislature has adjourned without resolving the Edison/energy issue, the focus will now be at the CPUC, which is scheduled to rule on a rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC, Direct Access suspension, etc. at its August 23rd meeting.

Best,
Jeff

Please forward to anyone else who needs to receive this.

Connell: Power cost twice Davis' figure 
July 6, 2001 
By JOHN HOWARD
The Orange County Register 
SACRAMENTO -- The average cost of electricity purchased under $43 billion of worth of state contracts is actually more than double the amount reported by Gov. Gray Davis' administration, state Controller Kathleen Connell said Thursday. 
Connell said her staff's analysis put the per-megawatt average at $170, compared with $69 to $79 estimated by Davis. 
Connell stopped short of suggesting that the higher cost could drive another increase in rates, although consumer groups said the higher amount likely would require some future increase. 
The controller, who writes the state's checks, said her figures assume fixed prices for natural gas over the duration of the contracts, which range from a few months to 20 years. 
The administration, noting that nearly half its contracts are pegged to the fluctuating market price of natural gas, said costs on many of the contracts would decline over time. 
Consumer groups were skeptical of the administration's numbers. 
"You could cut these numbers in various ways and make different averages, long-range or short-range contracts, peak power or nonpeak, and probably either average could be defended mathematically," said Nettie Hoge of The Utility Reform Network. "We can't tell you whether it's $69 or $170 - the contracts are very convoluted and complex."

Incrementalism seems to be the continuing strategy for SoCal.  Both the Assembly (AB82xx) and the Senate (SB 78xx) will pass MOU bills, but different versions that will not be reconciled until after the 30 day recess, if then.  Disaster is once-again put off until later, as both bills will pass on a non-urgency basis (as predicted yesterday) meaning that there is a 90 day delay for implementation.  This means another round of amendments, redrafts, negotiations, etc.

Sept.15 remains the key deadline.  Bank creditor forbearance will expire and in our view has only a small chance of being extended.  Moreover, FERC will have made its refund ruling by then and it is unlikely to be generous to California.

The worst case scenario for SoCal is that Burton continues to push SB78xx after the recess. For those who want to know why, keep reading. Otherwise, look for more updates later today as the full Assembly and Senate meet to vote on the MOU bills and the budget.

In committee, SCE detailed their opposition to SB 78XX.  Bob Foster (VP External for SCE) testified to  the following:

There are three problems with the legislation:
1.  Amount of haircut that SCE can sustain - cannot sustain $1 billion. (Note that many California politicians think that SoCal can get this from FERC refunds)
2.  Framework going forward for regulatory process on procurement is absent in the bill.
3.  The bill does not get the state out of the procurement of power.

Foster stated that even with the bill there is still the threat of litigation and involuntary bankruptcy. He stated that faith in the regulatory process is gone and that there needs to be an understanding that operating costs will be recovered and that a procurement framework is in place.  There also needs to be clarification on the reasonableness review process.

Question from Senator Dunn:  What would be necessary in the bill to get SCE to creditworthy status?

Response:
- Operating costs will be recovered
- Procurement framework
- Balancing account for over and under collection
- The amount of the haircut

SCE was asked how much of a haircut they could sustain and still be
creditworthy; Foster said that amount was $400 million.

Sen. Speier asked if the rating agencies had a chance to review the
legislation and if they said it was okay would SCE be in support. Foster stated that the bill does not meet the creditworthy test and he would be surprised if the ratings agencies did approve of the bill.  However, SCE probably would not be in support.

Sen. Morrow asked about the rating agencies and whether they have reviewed this type of legislation. SCE responded that the ratings agencies participated in a conference call with their lead bank and indicated that this type of proposal would not get SCE to creditworthiness.

Other problems with the bill outlined by SCE:
- Sunrise Plant:  It has been proven that the rates charged are cost-based and SCE opposes any PUC oversight of these rates.
- Transmission Lines:  SCE has problems with just charging book value of the trans lines in SB 78XX.  The debt is backed by a trust indenture and the trustee would not approve of the transfer without compensation.
- 125 kwh customers:  SCE does not break customers at this level and it
would be difficult for SCE to make this determination.
- Conservation lands:  Some lands provided in the bill are part of SONGS and are pledged for mitigation.
- The bill needs to be clarified regarding SCE vs. the parent company
references in SB 78XX.

Foster stated that, because the bill does not cover the PX liability, SCE could find itself in involuntary bankruptcy if the bill passes and is signed - he does not know.

Sen. John Burton said that SB 78xx is the bill that is going to be considered in the Senate. He said it wasn't going to be AB 82xx or Ab 83xx. 
He said to the representatives of Edison at the hearing: "I want to disabuse Edison of the notion that it is going to get a good deal at the end of the rainbow, because it is not going to happen...You will get the ability to sit down with the generators, who are your creditors, to cut a deal...This is what I kept telling people was going to happen, and this is what is happening. I am about the only person for the bill. Many of my members don't really want it. But God forbid Edison doesn't want it."

We are told by a private source that Sen. John Burton has promised that he "can prevent anything with a rate increase for consumers from passing the Senate--I can make that stick, I have done the head count."

He will push SB78xx, which puts all rate increases on the business sector.  Bad news for all the bills (supported by SoCal) that spread the rate increases more widely.  When the legislature resumes in August, a continued push for this bill by Burton could push SoCal into bankruptcy.
