In advance of the video conference tomorrow amongst the Houston and London 
personnel involved in the Pulp & Paper deals, I now attach a final draft 
version of a "schematic" which sets down the trade flow structure on the 
deals sourced by EEFT for ECTRIC.  If you have any comments on this, please 
let me know.

Sara / Carol / Dale:  Please see fit to let any other appropriate personnel 
in Houston have a copy of this document at your discretion.

Kind regards

Mark

Edmund,

My understanding is that your understanding is correct.  I shall speak with 
Sara on this issue and then inform all interested parties to avoid further 
confusion from certain quarters in 
London........................................................

Kind regards

Mark

Mark,

This needs to be cleared up.  

My understanding is that ECTRIC through EEFT does the trade.  The deal is 
backed to back with ECT and booked in the ECT book.  The deal number for the 
original trade should also therefore be from the Houston book.  I've already 
told this to Lee - correct me if my understanding of the position is 
incorrect.

Best, Ed.

Jeff

Given the apparent confusion about how European trades ought to be booked and 
monitored, can we arrange a conference call/ video conference in the near 
future to iron out any anomalies and ensure that all parties are satisfied 
with the arrangements.

Thanks
Tom

Tanya

I thought that all Pulp & Paper deals were booked in Houston?

 It would seem that this deal has been booked incorrectly from ECTRIC, when 
it should have been booked from Houston (ECT?)

I have looked at Inapa from a credit perspective.

I am assuming that this deal was approved by someone in London Credit, i.e. 
Lee Munden,etc. My understanding of this deal is that it is bewtween a London 
legal entity and the counterparty. ECT's involvement is an intercompany back 
to back position. This deal should be confirmed out of the London office, and 
exposure monitored there. 

Thanks,
Tanya

Sara,

Per my last e-mail on the Papeis Inapa deal, herewith for your complete 
information a copy of the final form of Deemed ISDA Confirmation very 
helpfully drwan up by Edmund Cooper in London to document the trade between 
EEFT (for ECTRIC) and Papeis Inapa.

May be when you get a few minutes, we can have a chat just to confirm the 
Enron entities involved in paper deals in Europe as there appear to be 
certain people in London who are a little confused on this issue.

Kind regards

Mark

Tom,

Here's the final version, subject to:

1. Need to insert the Trade Date at the top of page 2
2. Need to insert the Houston deal number.

Let me know if you have any queries.

Regards, Edmund.
