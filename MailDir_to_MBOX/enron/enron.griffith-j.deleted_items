Hey John,
 
Clearly having any job is better than  none, but I am curious how y'all are viewing the UBS acquisition.  If a  clear break from Enron can be achieved quickly, that would be a beautiful  thing.  However, it is hard to imagine that will be possible.   Thoughts?  I have been talking with Fairley, but I am curious if there was  anything that left a bad taste in your mouth from your meetings with him.   My resume has already been sent to most of the energy companies, but I have  received zip responses.  The Enron Effect has really confused the  market.  I have not lost hope, but if I do not start seeing some movement  by the end of February I will begin to worry.  I still hope to stay in  energy and to stay in Houston, but if February proves to be a dead month, I will  start considering relocating.  What a friggin' mess.  Where are y'all  going to be located?
 
Hopefully, you have been able to put  some of this behind you and enjoy the forced "slow time".  I played golf  last week, but I had to use someone's clubs and it completely screwed me (I  wouldn't even consider what I was doing "golf").  Oh well, back to the  range.
 
Keep in touch,
Mathew

i am doing ok this morning.  
i went to see the apt and i didnot like it.  too small.    but i saw a few others that i  want to take a look at today.    
i did not get to speak to shelly last night.   i got home about 8:30 pm.  i just went driving around montrose and i found some duplexes and fourplex apts.  
then i had dinner late with my cousin and my friend mike and came home and went to bed.    i have just been in this funky mood - dont know why...

You do not have to apologize to me.  I understand completely.  It is stress=
ful for me as well.  I hope your little friend doesn't bother you too much.

By the way, if you don't feel like picking me up at the dealership I unders=
tand.  It is a fairly long drive for you.  Just let me know.  Thanks.

i dont know why, but at first it felt a little awkward yesterday when we we=
re going into my house.  it felt as though i was sneaking a boy into my roo=
m.  i hope i didnt make you feel uncomfortable.  i was so happy that you ca=
me by and that i was able to see you and hold you comfortably at last.  i g=
uess i didnt really know how to react b/c my roommates were home.  dont get=
 me wrong.  they are really awesome people.  they dont care who comes over.=
  i think it has been quite a while since i brought "male"company over thou=
gh.  they probably would have been excited for me.  i think it was just me =
who was feeling strange.  i am really really close to my cousin shelly, but=
 i dont really want her to know what is going on between us.  i guess i sti=
ll feel somewhat awkward with you being married and all and then being at m=
y house - and with things progressing as they are between us.  i just feel =
strange.   like this "feels right", but it "is not right".  i really enjoy =
being with you,  but i guess i'd be much more at ease if you were not attac=
hed.  i am sorry to mention this all over again.  i know it is the last thi=
ng you need to hear on a monday morning.  i dont know what your plans are -=
 and you probably dont know what your plans for the future are as your marr=
iage is concerned.  and you dont  need to answer me.  i am not asking for a=
n answer or explanation - just venting i guess.   i hope you understand whe=
re i am coming from.   do you ever experience this?   this odd feeling that=
 i am experiencing?

i dont know.  maybe i dont know what i am talking about.   maybe b/c "my li=
ttle friend" is visiting i tend to be a little more sensitive than usual.  =
 i feel so uncomfortable today - maybe that is more info than you need to k=
now, right now.   sorry......i guess its a female thing.......  : - (

well i hope that the rest of your day goes well.=20

Hey what is going on?  How did you sleep last nite.  I didn't sleep well.  =
I had weird dreams.  Anyway, I had a wonderful time yesterday.  I hope you =
did as well.  You have a very nice room.  Everything a person needs.  A nic=
e soft bed, a tv, a closet, a computer and a nice soft bed, oh did I mentio=
n that already, I guess that is on my mind. =20

Have a wonderful day and I will talk to you soon.

I might need a ride today, are you still okay with that?  I have to call th=
e dealership when they open.  Thank you for offering.

Sorry it has taken me so long to respond, I don't think I will have a chance to have drinks with you.  I have to work a little late then I will have to go home.  I am sorry.  I sure do wish I could join you.  What are you doing tonite?  what are your plans for the weekend?  I hope to see you this weekend.  I will call you and let you know.  

Did you talk to your cousin shelly about the new apt?  Have you decided what you are going to do?  I hope everything works out.  

It has been a very busy day.  I am beat.  I think when I get home I will collapse.  I need a body massage.  Do you know anyone that could give me a good body massage?  I need someone with a strong but gentle touch.  What do you think?  I think I would probably return the favor as well.

What time are you leaving today?

John,
 
You are absolutely right. I have advised Tom Barkley to call Larry May before the new Ostrip was pushed out,  making sure it would not affect his book.  For some reason, it was not carried
out correctly. 
 
In the future, I will make sure this will not happen again.
 
 
Zimin
 
PS: I am on a business trip.  I will talk to you more when I come back.

Subject: OStrip Function



As you know, the Ostrip Functionality has been altered.  This change has affected the way the larryoptmodel values the gas daily options.  The reason the larryoptmodel is affected is because the larryoptmodel was defining the inputs to the Ostrip model differently than the documentation asked.  Let me explain.  The Ostrip Model has the following date inputs:

NowToSet        - Fixed Price = zero 
                - Forward Start = days from now until strike is set 

BegDays - Fixed Price = days from now until start of option 
                - Forward Start = days from when strike is set until start of option 

EndDays - Fixed Price = days from now until end of option 
                - Forward Start = days from when strike is set until end of option 

FwdStFlag       - Fixed Price = 0 
                - Forward Start = 1 

The Ostrip model should overlook the NowToSet days if the FwdStFlag = 0 (fixed price option).  It assumes the option is set right now.  The "Old Ostrip Model" did not overlook this input.  This is the problem.  In Larryoptmodel, the NowToSet is the same for Fixed Price options and Forward Start Options, the BegDays is the same and the EndDays is the same.  Thus when the "Old Ostrip Model" incorrectly used the NowToSet days, this made the Larryoptmodel value the option correctly.  When the "New Ostrip Model" was put into production, this model overlooks the NowToSet date, thus giving an incorrect value in Larryoptmodel.

Larryoptmodel has to be changed to reflect the above inputs.  It is actually only a change to one date.  This date will be used in calculating the three days above.  If the option is a fixed price option then the date will be today and NowToSet will be Today minus Today (zero), BegDays will be Start of Option minus today, EndDays will be End of Option minus today.  If the option is a forward start option, then the date will be when the strike is set and the NowToSet with be the strike setting date minus today, BegDays will be Start of Option minus the strike date, EndDays will be the End of Option minus strike date.

It is important to note that it is unexcusable to make any changes to the models without consulting the traders first.  If there was a problem with the "Old Ostrip Model" then the trader should have been notified right away.  This could have meant that the options were being misvalued when trading.  In this case, however, Larry had figured a way around this problem and he was valuing correctly.  When the model was changed, that changed the larryoptmodel valuation and now it was being valued incorrectly.  Either way, any problems with the models should be communicated with the traders right away.  Any changes to the models should be communicated to the traders before they are made.

Please let me know if any have any questions or concerns.  Thanks. 

John

Weather Headlines
Thursday January 31, 2002
The Great Lakes and New England see the full effects of a winter storm.
Colder air settling South and East over the next several days as storms
remain active.
It is a very active weather map with extremes on it. For example, Tucson,
AZ saw snow yesterday, Kansas City Ice, Chicago has seen almost a foot of
snow the last 24 hours and Washington DC was around 80 degrees yesterday.
This storm has been a slow mover, but should start to accelerate to the
Northeast today. The next system in the short term is a quick clipper
system coming through the Great Lakes and heading out to sea. It may
rapidly intensify off the coast late in the period, but probably too far
offshore for any real problems. The air behind all of this is cold, but not
arctic. Even though the five day numbers remain below normal in the West
and above in the East due to current extremes, the overall pattern will be
relaxing for a few days allowing many areas to gravitate to close to
seasonal norms this weekend.
More active weather is expected in the 6-10 day period. Winter storm
enthusiasts may see a couple of major storms the first two weeks of
February if the MRF is correct. These will likely track farther to the
South and East than recent storms opening up the East coast to some
potential snow and ice. The Canadian once again hints at a real cold
surface high coming down next weekend. It does not show up in the others,
but the overall pattern would be supportive of a colder pattern. I don't
see the numbers more than a few degrees below normal. The main story could
be the storms rather than the cold if the models verify.
For the period Thursday January 31 through Monday February 4, expect the
following temperature trends:
Average 4 to 9-degrees below normal: Rockies, Southern and Central Plains,
All of the Western US...
Average 1 to 3-degrees below normal: Northern Plains...
Average 1 to 3- degrees above normal: Mississippi and Ohio Valleys, Great
Lakes..
Average 4 to 6-degrees above normal: Northeast ...
Average 7 to 12-degrees above normal: Mid-Atlantic, Gulf Coast,
Southeast...

good morning.    i know this sounds corny, but as soon as you said good morning and smiled at me - i felt 10 times better!  you always brighten my day.  i mean it.
i am doing ok this morning.  
i went to see the apt and i didnot like it.  too small.    but i saw a few others that i  want to take a look at today.    
i did not get to speak to shelly last night.   i got home about 8:30 pm.  i just went driving around montrose and i found some duplexes and fourplex apts.  
then i had dinner late with my cousin and my friend mike and came home and went to bed.    i have just been in this funky mood - dont know why...

Good morning, you look very nice today.  How are you doing?  How was the apt?  Any problems at home because of Shelly?

Anyway have a great day.  I really love seeing you each day.  Thanks for the ride yesterday.  I really appreciate it.

Talk to you soon.

good morning.    i know this sounds corny, but as soon as you said good morning and smiled at me - i felt 10 times better!  you always brighten my day.  i mean it.
i am doing ok this morning.  
i went to see the apt and i didnot like it.  too small.    but i saw a few others that i  want to take a look at today.    
i did not get to speak to shelly last night.   i got home about 8:30 pm.  i just went driving around montrose and i found some duplexes and fourplex apts.  
then i had dinner late with my cousin and my friend mike and came home and went to bed.    i have just been in this funky mood - dont know why...

Good morning, you look very nice today.  How are you doing?  How was the apt?  Any problems at home because of Shelly?

Anyway have a great day.  I really love seeing you each day.  Thanks for the ride yesterday.  I really appreciate it.

Talk to you soon.

Hi John,

I'm the one who's working with eric on the spread option price. Jared indicated you'd get him something today....could you tell me what your using for you vols (FGT/MKTAREA and correlations (between Z2/Z3, and between (Z2/Z3) and FGT/MKTAREA)? Also, once I've plugged in the numbers if you'd like to see my results, let me know.

thanks, 

cjc

During the course of their investigation, Special Agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation will be taking documents they believe may be important for their investigation from employees' offices.  The FBI has agreed to return copies of such documents. 

In addition, should you have an immediate need for a document requested by the FBI, please make a copy of the specific document and give the original to the FBI. Thank you for your cooperation.

Weather Headlines
Tuesday January 29, 2002
A very healthy spring/winter storm to deal with in the short term. This
storm will bring about a pattern change, though still nothing severe in
terms of cold.
A mixed bag of precipitation has developed today over the Central Plains. A
healthy combination of shallow cold air in the North and record warmth in
the South will help spin up a sizeable storm in the Southern Plains later
today that will turn to the NE. There are a variety of winter weather
watches out from Kansas, Missouri , Nebraska, Iowa, and Illinois. More can
be expected through the Great Lakes and New England later in the week.
There will be snow with this, but also some potential for significant
freezing rain as well. The storm track is expected to run from NW Texas to
just South of Chicago then Western New York. To the South, this is a rain
event with some thunderstorms as well. This storm will serve to collapse
the strong ridge that has been in place over the Eastern U.S. I certainly
expect a drop from the record highs of recent days, but nothing in the
earth shattering cold category. In fact, the raw numbers from the MRF have
trended warmer the last few runs. Since we don't have a thick snow cover to
tap from, I believe the period of cold setting up will not be as harsh as
what we saw in late December. As all of this is going on, some of the chill
that has invaded the West will be lifting out. I don't see a big run to
above normal with a surface high still sitting over the plateau region, but
it should not be as cold as the last couple of days.
While the talk in recent outlooks for the 6-10 day period has centered on
cold, it is interesting to note the new 6-10 and 8-14 day outlooks from the
NWS still have a warm bias to them. There is not a big snow cover on the
ground, a split flow in the jet stream is expected and the polar vortex in
Canada continues a slow retreat. With all of that as a backdrop, the slight
positive departures look reasonable to me. We may however crank out a
"Clipper Type" storm next week in the Great Lakes and New England. These
can sometimes be more prodigious snow makers than the big "Plains type"
counterpart we are currently seeing. This is especially true if the air
flows over the Lakes at the right angle, something I won't even try to
predict this far out. Other than this system, I don't see much action in
the 6-10 day period. However, there is some potential for another storm to
emerge out of the SW just after this.
For the period Tuesday January 29 through Saturday February 2, expect the
following temperature trends:
Average 4 to 6-degrees below normal: Intermountain West, Desert SW,
California, Pacific NW...
Average 1 to 3- degrees below normal: Plains and Rockies...
Average 4 to 9-degrees above normal: Great Lakes, Mississippi Valley...
Average 10 to 15-degrees above normal: Ohio Valley, Mid-Atlantic,
Northeast, Gulf Coast, Southeast...

"Attention Taliban! You are condemned. Did you know that? The instant the terrorists you support took over our planes, you sentenced yourselves to death. The Armed Forces of the United States are here to seek justice for our dead. Highly trained soldiers are coming to shut down once and for all Osama bin Laden's ring of terrorism, and the Taliban that supports them and their actions. 
"Our forces are armed with state of the art military equipment. What are you using, obsolete and ineffective weaponry? Our helicopters will rain fire down upon your camps before you detect them on your radar. Our bombs are so accurate we can drop them right through your windows. Our infantry is trained for any climate and terrain on earth. United States soldiers fire with superior marksmanship and are armed with superior weapons. 
"You have only one choice ... Surrender now and we will give you a second chance. We will let you live. If you surrender no harm will come to you. When you decide to surrender, approach United States forces with your hands in the air. Sling your weapon across your back muzzle towards the ground. Remove your magazine and expel any rounds. Doing this is your only chance of survival."

We are testing the new version of the Asian model from Research, and there are a couple of issues
we need to resolve with Paulo.  We should have a version ready for your testing by the end of this week.  
I will inform you and Errol when we complete our testing.

Here is the file for the Asian function. I am sorry about changing the comments to a C++ style. 
You may easily change it back to C style by using the replace function in MS-Word or from any other editor.

John,
When you get a moment...

Offer for CAL03, volumes are in the attached spreadsheet.
$5.00 strike.

And if they wanted to spend $500,000, where would the strike be?

Many thanks,

I will try to drive.  Probably not tomorrow, but maybe Wednesday or Thursday.  

Could we meet?  I wish I could pick you up, but that would take long.

What time will your cousin bring you to work this week?  I would really like to meet sometime, whether it be in my car or just at work early.

Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

We will be releasing new version of the Stack Manager and the EnronOnline website tonight . The following are the changes

1. Changes to Stack Manager:

1.1 Changes to toolbar icons:
To facilitate further development of the system, it has been found necessary to change the toolbar icons at the top of the Stack  Manager. The attached file shows the old icon and its new replacement. Next to each image below is the description of the function that is executed as well as the short cut key that is mapped to the same function:

 

1.2 New Functionality - Auto Suspend
The Auto Suspend function allows traders to set an absolute price change from a price level at which you would like the system to automatically suspend a specific product. This function is useful if your products use automatic price resets.

To activate this feature:
1. Select a product and click on Product Properties
2. Check the Enable box
3. Enter the Price Check and Suspend at +/- values
4. Click Update
Example: a trader Enables Auto Suspend and selects a $35.00 Price Check and a suspension level of +/- $5.00: The system will suspend the product when the mid price is above  $40.00 or below $30.00

You will need to enter a new Price Check or disable the Auto Suspend function to reactivate this Product if the Auto Suspend is triggered.  
Please note the system checks for any products that need to be suspended once a minute.


2. Changes to EnronOnline Website
 (These changes will be rolled out in phases over the next week and will be available to all customers only by Friday 5/4/01)

The following enhancements have been made to the EnronOnline Website:

2.1 Today's Transactions

Float Window:  In order to float the window, right click on the Today's Transactions section, click on the Float Window option.

Sort Ordering: Click on the column heading to change the sort order. 

Linked Transactions: You can display the linked Transactions in an expanded or collapsed view. To do so, right click in the Transaction display area and select full Expand or Full Collapse.

2.2 Submission Box

The submission box has been modified in order to show a space between each set of "zeros" for the volume the customer wants to sell/buy.

We have made the  following modifications to the EnronOnline applications.

Stack Manager Changes

Fill Order Enhancements - (Effective Tuesday September 25)
?	To fill a Top of Stack order in Stack Manager, Right click on the pink shaded order in the depth window of Stack Manager and select fill.
?	The trader now has the ability to fill limit orders that appear at the top of the trader's stack on both sides. 
?	The order will now be filled at the full order volume regardless of the trader's stack volume.
?	Filling an order will not move the trader's price or cause a hedge to occur.

Resize floated stack windows- (Effective Tuesday September 25)

You will now have the ability to resize the stack window to the desired extent.

Website Changes ( Effective Monday September 24)

Limit Order Restrictions on Physical Transactions -
?	Customers will not be allowed to transact with themselves on physical transactions. If a top of stack limit order has been placed on a physical product the counterparty or desk that placed the order will not be allowed to transact on it.
?	If a customer or desk has top of stack limit orders at different prices on both the bid and offer and subsequently moves the price of one so that they are at the same price, both orders will be cancelled. The customer would have effectively transacted with himself.

Please call me if you have any questions. Thanks.

We know you have questions about recent events impacting Enron and our plans for the future.  Ongoing investigations and pending litigation have made it difficult, if not impossible, to share information in a timely manner.  While we can't address certain issues, we can tell you about our initial plans to move Enron forward and emerge from bankruptcy, and we are eager to do that.

We had planned to hold an all-employee meeting tomorrow, January 23, at the Hyatt Regency.  However, we don't want to subject you to the media frenzy that would certainly surround such a meeting, so we've decided to postpone it.  We are currently making arrangements to hold a series of employee meetings within the building to protect your privacy.  We will provide the date and times to you as soon as the logistics for those meetings are finalized.

Prior to the employee meetings, we will provide an overview of Enron's new organizational structure.  You can expect that memo shortly.

Here is your data. 

 
I think the problem with the curve fetching is related to the ODBC configuration in your computers.

A woman in a hot  air balloon realized she was lost.  She lowered altitude and spotted a man  below.  She descended a bit more and shouted, "Excuse me, can you help  me?  I promised a friend I would meet him in an hour ago, but I don't know  where I am..."
The man consulted  his GPS and replied, "You're in a hot air balloon approximately 30 feet above a  ground elevation of 2,346 feet above sea level.  You are 31 degrees, 14.97  minutes north latitude, and 100 degrees, 49.09 minutes west  longitude."
"You must be a  Republican," said the balloonist.
"I am," replied  the man.  "How did you know?"
"Well, answered  the balloonist, "everything you told me is technically correct, but I still have  no idea what to make of your information, and the fact is I am still lost.   Frankly, you haven't been much help so far."
The man responded,  "You must be a Democrat."
"I am," replied  the balloonist, "but how did you know?"
"Well," said the  man, "you don't know where you are or where you are going, you have risen to  where you are due to a large quantity of hot air, you made a promise which you  have no idea how to keep, and you expect me to solve your problem...  The  fact is, you are in exactly the same position you were in before we met, but  now, somehow, it's my fault!"

good morning.    i know this sounds corny, but as soon as you said good morning and smiled at me - i felt 10 times better!  you always brighten my day.  i mean it.
i am doing ok this morning.  
i went to see the apt and i didnot like it.  too small.    but i saw a few others that i  want to take a look at today.    
i did not get to speak to shelly last night.   i got home about 8:30 pm.  i just went driving around montrose and i found some duplexes and fourplex apts.  
then i had dinner late with my cousin and my friend mike and came home and went to bed.    i have just been in this funky mood - dont know why...

wearing those heels yesterday was a bad idea.   they were killing me all night.  i had to take them off.   and then when i woke up this morning my ankle was swollen and bruised.  went to the dr earlier and she said i most likely injured a tendon or ligament.    great.  no heels for a while.

Weather Headlines
Monday October 15, 2001

*** Very fast pattern continues over the Eastern half of the country.
Models show tropical POTENTIAL for the Southeast/Gulf. They also continue
their insistence of a Western US trough in the extended period. ***

     This past weekends storm did not disappoint as a large heavy rain
shield developed. In the storms wake a sharply cooler airmass has descended
upon the Eastern half of the country. Reinforcements are on the way as rain
has broken out on the Plains. This next storm is quite dynamic, but does
not have the heat and moisture of its predecessor. However, it does have a
quick Canadian cold punch that will dominate the midweek period. The West
was quite warm this weekend, particularly the California coast. This above
normal air should largely remain in place through the next several days.
The region should start to cool late in the period if forecast changes
start to take place.

     Hurricane Karen was named North of Bermuda this weekend. I say named
because it actually struck Bermuda Friday as an unnamed storm with 90 mph
winds. It is now a Tropical Storm in the Canadian maritimes. There is a
disturbance in the NE Caribbean this morning. It does not have short term
potential to develop, but late this week there is a possibility. It bears
watching in terms of Gulf interests, but Florida looks more likely and it
may not even acquire tropical characteristics.

Model solutions continue to favor the development of a Trough in the West
and Ridge in the East. I accept it for now, but still feel we are in a
progressive pattern. Another interesting feature is the forecast
development of some legitimate arctic air in NW Canada by Day 10. Both the
Canadian and American solutions show this. The Canadian also shows a
classic "blocking" pattern developing over the Northern latitudes. This is
what most winter forecasts are alluding to and MAY offer a clue as to what
winter has in store. I suspect a piece of this will come down the last week
of the month, but for now I'll leave the 6-10 day warmer than normal South
and East and cooler in the West.

For the period October 15 through October 19, expect the following
temperature trends:
Average 4 to 6-degrees below normal: Great Lakes, Northern and Central
Plains, Ohio and Mississippi Valleys...
Average 1 to 3 degrees below normal: Pacific NW, Gulf Coast, Southern
Plains, Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Southeast...
Average 1 to 3-degrees above normal: Intermountain West, Rockies ...
Average 4 to 6-degrees above normal: California, Desert SW...
Unspecified areas will average close to normal...

Weather Headlines
Tuesday January 8, 2002
Thaw underway for the short term. Longer range models continue to insist
(as I continue to resist) that real arctic air arrives later in the month.
There is some potential for yet another winter storm in the East late in
the five day period. The point in question is how much cold air is
available or is it just another cold rain for many folks. That will be
answered later in the week. The overall pattern definitely looks warmer for
now though some of this energy goes into melting snow cover rather than
warming the air. The absence of snow in the Plains is one reason why they
are so much warmer relative to normal than areas farther East. But, most of
the country goes warmer than normal before the end of the week. The last to
catch on to this trend is the Southeast.
I am not as bullish as the charts (and some forecasters) in regards to cold
air developing in the medium range period and beyond. I am not saying next
week and the week after will not be colder than this week, they likely will
be. But, I continue to have questions as to intensity and Southern extent
of whatever develops. First, we have yet to see any real polar flow so far
this winter. Second, lack of deep snow cover in the Northern U.S. tends to
inhibit bitter cold. Third, and perhaps most important to me is the lack of
high surface pressures developing over Canada. Now, they may develop
eventually, but I want to see it first. Finally, most models have more of a
West to East configuration at the jet stream level rather than a NW to SE
orientation straight out of the arctic. Given these conditions and recent
history I am just not ready yet to pronounce any major cold developing. In
fact, I would expect the Gulf Coast and SE to actually run warmer than
normal through the 20'th of the month. The Plains, Lakes and NE probably go
back to below normal levels, but not excessively so. It looks comparable to
the past couple of weeks. The West is expected to take on a temperature
profile that closely resembles normal Mid-January levels.
For the period Tuesday January 8 through Saturday January 12, expect the
following temperature trends:
Average 1 to 3-degrees below normal: Southeast?
Average 1 to 3-above normal: Gulf Coast, Mid-Atlantic...
Average 1 to 3-degrees above normal: Northeast, Ohio Valley...
Average 4 to 9-degrees above normal: Northeast, Great Lakes, Ohio and
Mississippi Valleys, Southern Plains and Rockies, California, Intermountain
West, Desert SW, Pacific NW?
Average 10 to locally 20-degrees above normal: Central and Northern
Rockies, Central and Northern Plains...

In order to continually develop and make improvements to the functionality of EnronOnline we are rolling out several changes tonight, which will be in effect on Monday August 20, 2001. Some of these changes will affect Stack Manager while others affect the Website. A summary of these changes is listed below.

Stack Manager Changes

Top of Stack limit orders - This feature will allow the price submitted via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader's stack price. Stack Manger will list the price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the  floated stack window.  Orders will be queued by price and time stamp. When a counterparty trades on a " Top of Stack Entry" it will create back to back transactions; one between Enron and the counterparty submitting the order, and the other between Enron and the counterparty clicking on the website.

In order to turn on this functionality select the " Allowed Top of Stack" option, in the Orders section of the product properties page.  If regular limit order functionality is desired the "Allowed"  option should be selected.

Please note that this feature will be released in a disabled mode and will be turned on sometime next week after determining which business units want to roll this out.

Restricted Top of Stack limit orders - This feature will allow the price submitted only by internal traders via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader's stack price. Stack Manger will list price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the  floated stack window.  Orders will be queued by price and time stamp. When a counterparty trades on a " Top of Stack Entry" it will create back to back transactions one between Enron and the counterparty submitting the order, and the other between Enron and the counterparty clicking on the website.

In order to turn on this functionality select the " allowed as Restricted Top of Stack" option, in the Orders section of the product properties page.  If regular limit order functionality is desired the "Allowed"  option should be selected. If a product has active orders against it you will not be able to select the "Restricted Top of Stack" feature.

Advanced Filtering Ability on All Products Tab -  Drop down filtering capability is now available for each field in the All Products tab in stack manager. In order to filter click on the arrow next to the field title. A drop down box with a list of attributes will appear. Highlight the attribute by which you wish to filter. To turn off the filter click on the arrow and select the " All" option from the drop down box.


Website Changes

New Submission Screen for Restricted Top of Stack Limit Orders -  The submission screen for  products that allow  Top of Stack or Restricted Top of Stack limit orders is as follows.
 

The submit button on the left makes a submission for a normal transaction, while the button on the right will submit as a limit order.  In case of the Restricted Top of Stack limit orders only internal traders will see the new submission box. 

Price of Limit Orders 

Modify Limit Orders
 Customers now have the ability to modify the price of any active order. In order to do so highlight the order to be modified and use the plus or minus sign next to the price field on  at the top of the "Today's Orders" section. The price will move up or down in the same increments as the tick size for that product. Once the price is at the desired level click the "Set" button and the price will be modified. Another way to modify the price on a limit order is to click on the price field on a particular limit order.  You will see a box with plus, minus and set buttons that allow you to modify that order.

Expiration time for Limit Orders
Customers can now place limit orders with expiration times of up to 30 days. Currently they may place orders for only up to 12 hours.

Float the Today's Orders Section
You can now float the " Limit Order " section. In order to do so, right click in the "Today's Orders " section and select the float window option. In order to make the window " Stay On Top " right click on the floated window and select the stay on top option.

Mid Market Client - Mid market originators will now have the ability to transact on behalf of their customers, while including their desired margin on the trade, on EnronOnline products. In order to do so Click on the bid or offer price, a customised submission window will appear.  Select the counterparty for whom you wish to transact from a drop down list , enter the desired customer price and margin and click submit. For example if a customer wants to buy Nymex Sep 01 at 3.36 and you wish to have a 1 cent margin, please enter 3.36 as the desired price and 0.01 as the margin. The system will trade the order when the EnronOnline offer for Nymex Sep 01 is at 3.35, book the trade at 3.36 and record the 0.01 origination amount.

In order to be set up to use this functionality. Please call the EnronOnline Product Control Group.

Changes to Website Passwords - As an added security measure, which has been requested by many customers, some new password rules have been instituted. First, the password cannot be equal to the login ID. Second, each user will be prompted to change his password every 90 days. These rules apply to all website passwords for both internal and external users.


Please note  Stack Manager changes will be available all traders as of Monday August 20, 2001. The changes to the website will be rolled out to a few internal users on Monday with the rest of the internal users being upgraded Monday night, and external users by the end of the week.  Over the next couple of weeks all users will be prompted to change their website passwords.

If you have any questions regarding these changes please contact me at 713-853-1787.

DEAR MR. GRIFFITH,

Continental Airlines is committed to meeting new federal requirements regarding checked baggage and airport security fees. In an effort to keep you informed, below are the most recent changes that will affect your travel:

POSITIVE BAG MATCH
Effective January 18, 2002 the Federal Aviation Administration will require a positive bag match for travel within the U.S., its territories and commonwealths. Bags cannot be transported on the aircraft without confirmation that the customer has boarded the aircraft.

DOMESTIC CHECK-IN/ARRIVAL TIME
To ensure compliance with the Positive Bag Match policy without delays or inconvenience, Continental Airlines has changed the boarding time for domestic flights for tickets purchased on or after January 18, 2002. Customers checking baggage must do so at least 30 minutes prior to departure. All customers must be checked in and at the boarding gate no later than 15 minutes prior to scheduled departure. Customers who buy tickets on or after January 18, 2002 who are not at the boarding gate 15 minutes prior to departure are subject to having their reservations canceled, seats released and checked baggage removed from the flight.

SECURITY FEE
The Transportation Security Administration is requiring that airlines collect the September 11th Security Fee of $2.50 per enplanement, not to exceed $5.00 each way or $10.00 per round-trip ticket. This security fee goes into effect for tickets purchased on or after February 1, 2002. It applies to qualifying enplanements from airports in the U.S., its territories and commonwealths. This fee applies to all tickets including frequent flyer reward tickets, two-for-one tickets, tour conductors and infants for whom a fare has been collected.

Continental Airlines continues to make safety our number one priority. Be sure to stay informed with continental.com at:
http://continentalairlines.rsc01.net/servlet/cc4?JHEVCV*qhogEnkpMMpmoQLgkhgEJht*z*UA
before leaving for the airport. We're looking forward to welcoming you onboard!

Sincerely,
Mark F. Bergsrud
Vice President, Marketing
Continental Airlines, Inc.

Read this my sugar, pretty intense.  I believe that this was actually sent to the Taliban.

Anyway, call me when you get a chance to see what we will do with the car.

"Attention Taliban! You are condemned. Did you know that? The instant the terrorists you support took over our planes, you sentenced yourselves to death. The Armed Forces of the United States are here to seek justice for our dead. Highly trained soldiers are coming to shut down once and for all Osama bin Laden's ring of terrorism, and the Taliban that supports them and their actions. 
"Our forces are armed with state of the art military equipment. What are you using, obsolete and ineffective weaponry? Our helicopters will rain fire down upon your camps before you detect them on your radar. Our bombs are so accurate we can drop them right through your windows. Our infantry is trained for any climate and terrain on earth. United States soldiers fire with superior marksmanship and are armed with superior weapons. 
"You have only one choice ... Surrender now and we will give you a second chance. We will let you live. If you surrender no harm will come to you. When you decide to surrender, approach United States forces with your hands in the air. Sling your weapon across your back muzzle towards the ground. Remove your magazine and expel any rounds. Doing this is your only chance of survival."

Eric,

This is to update you on the current situation with the OSTRIP function in Exotica. After some lengthy analysis of the function, its inputs and the documentation associated with it, it was brought to our attention in the Research Group that the OSTRIP function was being utilized in different manners by different people within Enron. In order to remedy this situation, the documentation of Exotica was revised and more details were added, so as to make explicitly clear the distinctions between the fixed price options and forward start options. (You will find attached a copy of the most recent version of the Exotica documentation.)

In addition to discussions with Santiago Garcia in structuring, it was seen to be important to ensure that those responsible for booking the options in ERMS (specifically, Jeremy Wong) be updated on the changes. By pure coincidence, the two ways that inputs were made for fixed price options gave the same values for the premiums. However, one methodology is really incorrect as far as the documentation is concerned, and the attempt has been made to rectify this. The forward start option pricing has not changed in any way.

I would like to arrange a meeting tomorrow afternoon (Thursday) between all those parties concerned to ensure uniformity of pricing across the board. If you are available, I would appreciate it if we could meet at around 4:00 PM.

Regards,

Tom Barkley

Yes I think my position would still be maintained if the trade group is acq=
uired, however, I don't know if that is a definite thing.  I have heard tha=
t one company that is bidding on us (I don't know which one) would want to =
cut 250 more people.  Who knows who those people will be.  I just keep thin=
king about the retention bonuses and I was not one of the lucky recipients,=
 so what keeps a company from coming in and keeping only the people that we=
re deemed important in the first go round.  Also, if I find another oppurtu=
nity what would make me stay here when I get overlooked in the area of impo=
rtance (retention bonuses).  I want to work with John Arnold and Mike Maggi=
 as long as I can because I think I could learn alot more from them, but I =
do not want to work for people that don't see my importance, does that make=
 since?  I am not trying to treat this like grade school or anything, but I=
 think I add alot to the group and I know that there are places that would =
see that and reward me for that.  Anyway, I am here for now. =20

I think I told you but maybe not, I have an offer from Tractebel.  It is a =
good offer but not a great one.  I have to think about it.  Have you talked=
 to them?  Have you talked to Fairley?  If not, you need to, they are beefi=
ng up.  Also, RWE, have you talked to them?  You need to talk to them as we=
ll.  Let me know if I can help in any way.

I would love to play golf with you anytime.  Just let me know, I can leave =
here pretty much whenever I want.  Also have a wonderful time in Florida, h=
ave a few drinks for me, make a few double bogeys for me and chase a few wo=
men for me.  Call me anytime, my home number is (713) 527-8743 and work is =
(713) 853-6247.

Good Luck and I look forward to talking to you.

John

Johnny,

What do you mean you are there "for the  time being"?  Wouldn't your positi=
on be maintained when the trading group  is acquired?  I would think that a=
s long as J Arnold has a say you would be  included.  Am I incorrect?  Thin=
gs in Unemployment Land are pretty  surreal.  When I stop and think about t=
he hours that I put in only to be  laid off...go figure.  However, I try no=
t to dwell in areas where I had no  control.  I have been flooding my resum=
e throughout the Houston-based  energy companies to no avail.  There is no =
telling when the "Enron Effect"  will wear off on the capital markets, so I=
 might have to consider a different  industry (know of any good antique sho=
ps that need a full time  cashier?)
=20
I tried to enjoy the holidays, but I  constantly kept an eye on my inbox an=
d carried my cell phone everywhere just in  case.  As you can imagine, not =
completely relaxing.  The good news is  that I am going to Florida Sunday t=
o visit a friend, run on the beach, drink  heavily and hopefully play golf.=
  Have you been able to play?  When  all of this gets resolved, you and I d=
efinitely need to hit the links (as long  as you don't mind me wandering th=
rough the woods most of the time).
=20
Please keep me posted on your plans and  I look forward to getting together=
 sometime soon.
=20
Mathew

John,

The Id that I gave you is for EnronOnline website, if you already have a website Id not to worry, the one I issued you is a read only Id.  I show no record of an Id in your name, do you mind forwarding back to me the Id you are using and I will put into our records.

Thanks,

Kathy

Since the Pledge of  Allegiance and The Lord's Prayer are not allowed in
most public schools  anymore because the word "God" is mentioned....a kid in
Arizona wrote the  attached NEW School prayer.  I liked it....
	Now I sit me down  in school
	Where praying is against the rule
	For this great nation under  God
	Finds mention of Him very odd.
	If Scripture now the class recites,
	It violates the Bill of Rights.
	and anytime my head I bow
	Becomes a Federal matter now.

	Our hair can be purple, orange or  green,
	That's no offense; it's a freedom scene.
	The law is specific, the law is precise.
	Prayers spoken aloud are a serious vice.

	For praying in a public hall
	Might offend someone with no faith at all.
	In silence alone we must meditate,
	God's name is prohibited by the state.

	We're allowed to cuss and dress like freaks,
	And pierce our noses, tongues and cheeks.
	They've outlawed guns, but FIRST the Bible.
	To quote the Good Book makes me liable.

	We can elect a pregnant Senior Queen,
	And the 'unwed daddy,' our Senior King.
	It's "inappropriate" to teach right from wrong,
	We're taught that such "judgments" do not belong.

	We can get our condoms and birth controls,
	Study witchcraft, vampires and totem poles.
	But the Ten Commandments are not allowed,
	No word of God must reach this  crowd.

	It's scary here I must confess,
	When chaos reigns the school's  a mess.
	So, Lord, this silent plea I make:
	Should I be shot; My soul please take!
	Amen
If you aren't ashamed to do this, please pass this on.  Jesus said, " If you
are ashamed of me," I will be ashamed of you  before my Father."
Not ashamed. Passing this on.

If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

It is good to hear from you Bilal.  I hope things are going well.  Good luck with talking to everyone.  I guess the only advise I have is to keep sending out resumes.  Go to all the web based recruiting sites and send out your resume to anything that looks interesting.  Also, talk to a recruiter as well.  Are you working with one now?  

Anyway, nothing is going on here.  Just waiting around.  I hate it.  I guess I feel lucky to have a job.  They are not communicating very well with the employees.  I can't wait until all of this is over.

Take care and let me know if you need anything.

John

Hi John,
Hope you had great holidays. I just wanted to update you on my progress. I
returned on Jan 6th after taking some time off from job search and have been
in active discussion with MRE Consulting and Dynegy. Although I have not
received an offer from either I am hopeful.

At Caminus I emailed Debbie and unfortunately I could not set up a time to
meet her before New Years. She has been on vacation since then and i am
looking forward to meeting her when she gets back. I think after Caminus I
would feel comfortable making a decision.

Do you have any suggestions/thoughts? Once again thanks a lot for looking
out for me!
Bilal

Weather Headlines
Tuesday November 13, 2001

*** Current pattern should hold through the five day period. I will now buy
a significant pattern change in the 6-10 day period with near unanimous
model support.***

     Most of the country remains very quiet (and very mild) in terms of
sensible weather. There are a few areas of highlight however. The system
that brought rain to California yesterday is weaker today and will break up
somewhat is it goes through the Southern Rockies. It may still emerge as a
moisture producer for West Texas. The last of the chill will be exiting the
Northeast today as winds turn more towards the SW bringing the center of
the nation warmth in. Five day temperatures will still have to be
considered as above average for most of the country.

 After more than a week of delays, it looks like we can finally hone in
with some detail to the change in the weather pattern. I still have some
question as to the degree of arctic air involved and how far South it can
go. Where I am very confident though is we will sweep away the widespread
60 and 70 degree temperatures Thanksgiving week. Changes in the Pacific
should show up in North America in about a week. The current zonal flow in
the jet will amplify allowing a full latitude ridge to build up and into
the Canadian Rockies. Downstream then, the jet comes in from the NW carving
out a trough. The most severe case comes from the Canadian models which
spin up quite the storm for Thanksgiving. It has some support from its
ensembles. The others are less aggressive, but certainly sharply colder.
Going from double digit above to double digit below normal will be a
dramatic change for sure. The continental divide will likely be the cutoff
for how West this air goes. As for timing, I would look for the Plains on
Tuesday of Thanksgiving week getting to the East Coast on Friday.

For the period Tuesday November 13 through Saturday November 17, expect the
following temperature trends:

Average 1 to 3-degrees below normal: Southeast, Mid-Atlantic ?

Average 1 to 3-degrees above normal: Northeast, Gulf Coast, California,
Pacific NW?

Average 4 to 6-degrees above normal: Great Lakes, Ohio and Mississippi
Valleys, Southern Rockies and Plains, Intermountain West?

Average 7 to 12-degrees above normal: Northern and Central Rockies and
Plains?

Weather Headlines
Wednesday January 23, 2002
Record warm temperatures may develop over much of the East this period
while a few cold records could be set in the West. Highly energetic pattern
continues into the medium range period.
The short term temperature forecast looks very straight-forward. A broad
ridge off the Atlantic Coast and the subsequent SW flow of air into the
Eastern half of the country assures a continuation of unusually warm air.
It may peak this weekend with a lull in the storm activity promoting less
precip and more sunshine. Widespread 20-30 above normal temperatures may
occur for a day or two. It would be that warm now if not for the large area
of clouds and rain showers in the East today. Another wave of low pressure
will develop on this weak front adding additional rains to the mix. Farther
South into the Tenn and Ohio Valleys this rain may get heavy. You will have
to go well North into New England to find any measurable snow. Or, you
could head West where a Pacific onshore flow and enough cold air reside for
snow that could be measured in feet in the higher elevations. The trough to
develop in the West looks quite strong. Most models seem to indicate the
current moderate chill will be enhanced late in the period. This may set
the stage for a few record lows through the interior by early next week.
Some of the more extreme solutions bring enough cold air to the coast for
snow in Seattle and Portland. Its possible, but I am not ready to commit to
that yet.
I continue to see private forecast indications of a turn to colder weather
in the 6-10 day outlook and just beyond. The latest NWS 6-10 and 8-14 day
outlooks keep the current regime going. Frankly, I see little to argue with
there. The models do seem to edge some arctic air into the Interior NW and
Northern Plains which seems reasonable. I also believe some cooling is in
order for the East given the potential for record breaking warmth in the
short term. Any front should accomplish this. The storm track from the
Pacific into the Southern Plains and NE still appears active during the
period. January can still produce snows in our Northern latitudes even if
the period averages out above normal. But, these systems still have more
rain in them than snow. Most of the signals I look for to bring a
meaningful cold deep into the U.S. just aren't there. About the only one
that is there is arctic air itself lurking across the border. Some years
that would be enough to forecast it Southward, but this is not one of those
years. As a result, I'll keep an above normal bias for now into the first
week of February for the East while a below normal bias remains in the
West.
For the period Wednesday January 23 through Sunday January 27, expect the
following temperature trends:
Average 4 to 6-degrees below normal: Intermountain West, Desert SW,
California...
Average 1 to 3- degrees below normal: Pacific NW...
Average 1 to 3-degrees above normal: Southern Plains and Rockies...
Average 4 to 9-degrees above normal: Gulf Coast, Southeast, Central Plains,
Mississippi Valley, Northern and Central Rockies...
Average 10 to 15-degrees above normal: Northern Plains, Great Lakes, Ohio
Valley, Mid-Atlantic, Northeast...

You may have received an e-mail from out PEP system asking you to provide feedback on certain employees. Please disregard. This was sent in error and it is not necessary at this time to complete the evaluations. These employees are on vacation and entered their reviewers into the system before they left.  Since then the business has decided to postpone the evaluation process and the opening of PEP. Please feel free to call me if you have any questions. Thanks!

To All Employees:

This morning Enron took a series of actions designed to stabilize our situation and preserve the value in our businesses:

-- We filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Contrary to popular belief, this does not mean we are out of business. What it does mean is that we have entered into a court-supervised process by which we can continue to operate most of our businesses, reorganize our finances, and explore various strategic, operational and financial alternatives, including the sale of non-core assets, in an orderly manner.


-- In connection with our filing for Chapter 11 reorganization, Enron is in active discussions with leading financial institutions for debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing and expects to complete these discussions shortly. Upon the completion and court approval of these arrangements, the new funding will be available immediately on an interim basis to supplement Enron's existing capital and help the Company fulfill obligations associated with operating its business, including its employee payroll and payments to vendors for goods and services provided on or after today's filing.

-- We filed a lawsuit against Dynegy, alleging breach of contract and other causes of action for Dynegy's wrongful termination of our proposed merger. We are asking the court for damages of not less than $10 billion.

-- We also announced this morning that we are in active discussions with various leading financial institutions about providing financial support to recapitalize and revitalize the company's wholesale energy trading operations under a new ownership structure. As contemplated, this recapitalized entity will be staffed with people from Enron's current wholesale energy trading team, and will conduct counterparty transactions through EnronOnline.

These are the first steps in a strategic restructuring process that will allow Enron to meet its obligations to its creditors and preserve the value in our core wholesale energy trading business. From an operational standpoint, our energy businesses - including our pipelines, utilities and other energy assets - are conducting safe and normal operations around the world, and will continue to do so.

As you know, the second and unavoidable part of our restructuring is to improve our financial position by implementing a comprehensive cost-savings program. This will entail a significant reduction in our work force. This is painful for all of us and our goal is for as many of you as is possible to know where you stand by the end of the day Tuesday, though in some cases notification will take longer.

For our friends and colleagues who will lose their jobs as part of this process, you will remain on the company payroll for now. In addition, we will submit a severance pay plan to the Bankruptcy Court for approval. This approval must be received before we can begin paying severance benefits. We will be providing more information about this plan as soon as the Court has made its determination.

I know these actions raise new questions about our company's future and what this means for each of us. Your business unit leader will be holding floor meetings on Monday to discuss these events with you. In addition, you can access a copy of the press release on  <http://home.enron.com/>. We will also have a Q&A and other materials for you on Monday. While there is a great deal we simply don't know yet, we hope these materials will help answer at least some of your questions.

When decisions are made affecting our company, people, and operations, we will let you know as quickly as possible. There is still considerable value and opportunity in our business. The strategic restructuring process that we are beginning will allow us to preserve that value and those opportunities.

On behalf of the Board and entire management team, we greatly appreciate your patience, your professionalism and whatever support you can offer each other as we navigate through these tough times to a better future.

Ken

We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. 

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your "native" desktop (stand alone computer).

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding "1" or a "2" in the subject field.

If you're not sure which one you have, please contact myself x39673, Teresa Mandola x39807 or Jennifer McQuade x53614 and we'll come by your desk to help you.

Thank you,

Oh by the way, I am going to take my car in on Monday, so maybe you can give me a ride on Monday.  I will let you know, thanks for the offer.  I do not know what I am doing this evening yet.  Probably not have time to do anything, I thought I would.  I am sorry.   I would like to meet for breakfast though.  Hope you have time.  

I miss you today.

Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

FROM:  Enron Property & Services Corp

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee.  

For employees who park in the Allen Center, Met, or Enron Center garage, new parking rates are in effect beginning with the January 31st paycheck.  Rates for 2002 have increased by $5 for unreserved and $10 for reserved spaces.  This increase is consistent with first of the year rate increase obligations in Enron's parking lease agreements with the garage operators.  Enron is continuing to subsidize employee parking for Enron lease garages.  

Direct parking costs to employees are as follows:
Enron Center Unreserved	2001 Employee Cost - $94 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $99 per month	
Enron Center Reserved 4th Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $215 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $225 per month	
Enron Center Reserved 3rd & 5th Floors	2001 Employee Cost - $165 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $175 per month	
Allen Center Unreserved	2001 Employee Cost - $94 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $99 per month	
Allen Center Reserved 3rd Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $215 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $225 per month	
Allen Center Reserved 4th Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $165 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $175 per month	


Please note that effective January 31st only the Enron Center and Allen Center Garages will be available for Enron employee parking.  To request parking or to switch to these garages please call Parking and Transportation at ext. 37060 or ext. 36399.

If you have any questions about Bus Passes or Parking, please call Martin Katz at ext. 59322.

Hey what is going on?  I haven't talked to you in a few days and I feel los=
t.  First day at work in a while.  It feels weird.  I miss you very much.  =
I hope you have had a wonderful holiday season.  Mine has been okay.  Very =
long.  Not as good as it could have been.  I think about you every second o=
f the day.  I am sorry I haven't called but the times I did call and I only=
 had a limited amount of time, it didn't end good and I didn't want that to=
 happen.  I want you to know that out of sight does not mean out of mind.  =
You are always on my mind.  I can't get by without thinking of you.  I have=
 thought alot about my situation over the last couple of weeks.  I don't kn=
ow how I am going to manage it but I need to make a change for myself.  I f=
eel like I am in some sort of prison.  I need more freedom, I need more lov=
e, I need more affection, I need more life.  You probably try not to think =
about us because of the situation, I understand that, but I hope I haven't =
left your mind completely.  You are so special, so beautiful, wonderful, fu=
n and I haven't even got to know you that well yet.  Have a wonderful New Y=
ear and please be careful.  Think about me.  I cherish the day I can see yo=
u again. =20

John

The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

John,

On the O drive you will not be allowed to create folders, as this is a common drive -- so all folders are created by IT (it was this way at Enron). The exception to this rule is if you are the owner of the "main" folder ... which in this case you are.

So ... to make a long story short, YOU will be able to create folders under this path that we have requested, but your team members won't. They will have to request access to do so.

Again, it's the same process as we used at Enron

thank

spc

Weather Headlines
Friday January 25, 2002
No changes to my earlier thinking. Near record warmth in the short term to
replaced by sharply colder weather in the 6-10 day period.
The short term outlook is pretty simple, not to mention quiet. Any action
to speak of is confined to the extreme Western U.S. To be sure, a healthy
storm comes in off the Pacific spreading moisture all the way down the
coast. The higher elevation should see some significant snows. With the
deepening trough in the area, we can expect the cool bias of recent weeks
to continue. It has also become apparent that the Pre-Christmas ridge has
reappeared in the Eastern U.S. Well above normal temperatures through the
weekend are expected nearly everywhere to the right of the Rockies. Most of
this occurs with little or no precipitation. Early next week the Western
U.S. storm starts to emerge in the High Plains. The Gulf of Mexico starts
to open up and a moderate intensity Canadian High pushes into the Northern
Plains. This initiates a turn to colder air that lasts into the medium
range.
There are so many weather models to choose from these days that picking one
to be right is very difficult. I'll look at trends and opportunities for
consensus, but more and more the forecaster who hits has to look at the big
picture rather than an individual model solution. So it goes with the 6-10
day period. I am confident of a colder turn in the East during the period
with some cooling well South into Florida. I remain comfortable with going
below normal for most of the country and double digit below remains a
possibility, especially in the Plains which would make this overall colder
than late December. The Gulf Coast and SE may still see 5 day numbers
average above normal as the cooling really won't take hold until late. But,
I dont expect one big Canadian high to plunge South. It will likely only go
as far South as the Great Lakes. The Southern stream may also get more
active this period dumping some snows in the Midwest that really haven't
seen it this winter. As mentioned yesterday, I still expect this to be a
transitory cold, but the warm up after Day 10 may not be as pronounced as
recent warm ups, at least not right away.
For the period Friday January 25 through Tuesday January 29, expect the
following temperature trends:
Average 4 to 6-degrees below normal: Intermountain West, Desert SW,
California...
Average 1 to 3- degrees below normal: Pacific NW...
Average 1 to 3-degrees above normal: Southern Plains and Rockies...
Average 4 to 9-degrees above normal: Northern and Central Plains,
Mississippi Valley, Northern and Central Rockies...
Average 10 to 15-degrees above normal: Great Lakes, Ohio Valley,
Mid-Atlantic, Northeast, Gulf Coast, Southeast...

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Ken Lay

John,
Well i am glad that you are still with the firm. I know how you feel cause i
have friends at Enron who tell me the same thing. Infact my brother works
for UBS Warburg in London and he does not know whats going on also.

I am working with a few recruiters but have not received good leads from
them. Actually I never thanked Andy Zipper for referring me to MRE so i
would appreciate if you could let him know how much that helped me out.

Hope things turn out for the best for you!
Bilal

hello
in the last week we recived some mail with  the virus attached.
the virus is strange because one window was opening  automaticaly when we
opened  the connection.
probably some mail  leaved from our pc with the virus attached (the virus is
autoreply) but  nothing appear  in our  exit-mail list
in this days we  recived  other mails with the some problem.
in this days we are checking  better our pc with one antivirus and for one week  we don't reply at any mail
probably the name of the virus is:   Virus  W32/Badtrans.B          
so,please,pay attention   and sorry for this  disadvantage
best regardswww.zebramodernariato.com

Toppling Arafat?
Jan 22nd 2002 
>From The Economist Global Agenda


Israel's latest military actions in the West Bank have deepened the Palestinian conviction that Ariel Sharon, Israel's prime minister, has decided to topple Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestinian Authority, and reoccupy all the areas it controls. Many Israelis now share this analysis






AP
AP
Going...?
YASSER ARAFAT'S shrivelled dominion is under daily attack. Early on January 22nd, tanks entered the West Bank town of Nablus, controlled by his Palestinian Authority (PA). Four Palestinians, suspected militants from the Islamist group Hamas, were killed-in a gun battle, according to Israel; assassinated in cold blood, in the Palestinian version of events. At the same time, the Israeli army was withdrawing from the centre of nearby Tulkarm, which it had occupied the day before, placing its 34,000 residents under curfew, arresting several people and engaging in sporadic shoot-outs with residents of a Palestinian refugee camp.
The invasion of Tulkarm was condemned by Terje Roed-Larsen, the UN's special co-ordinator for the Middle East peace process as a "dangerous escalation". Like the incursion into Nablus, it was part of a series of Israeli reprisals for a Palestinian attack on a Bat Mitzvah reception in the town of Hadera on January 17th. Six Israelis were killed and 30 wounded in a suicide attack, the first armed Palestinian operation inside Israel since Mr Arafat declared a ceasefire on December 16th. On the afternoon of January 22nd an unidentified gunman opened fire on a rush-hour crowd in central Jerusalem, injuring at least 20 people before being shot dead by police. 
The al-Aqsa Brigades-a militia linked to Mr Arafat's Fatah movement-claimed responsibility for both incidents, calling them revenge for Israel's unacknowledged assassination of Raed Karmi, one of its leaders, in Tulkarm, on January 14th. In response to the Hadera slaughter, Israel used F-16 jets to destroy the PA's main police station in Tulkarm on January 18th. One Palestinian police officer was killed and 40 people were wounded, including civilians. Then came the invasion. 
Shortly after the deaths in Nablus, Hamas too said it would reconsider the pause in its own suicide attacks in Israel. Popular support for Hamas was shown the same day in a thousands-strong demonstration in Nablus, which led to the release of one of its members, the brother of one of the dead men, from a PA jail.
 

 
So it looks as if Israel and the Palestinians are back to the politics of the last atrocity-the endless cycle of murder and retribution that characterised the intifada in the pre-ceasefire era. But Palestinians say this time it is different. "Israel is now implementing its plan to topple President Arafat, undermine the PA and reoccupy the PA areas," says Marwan Barghouti, the West Bank leader of Fatah. Mr Barghouti himself could soon be a target. Israel insists that he is the commander in charge of militias like the al-Aqsa Brigades. His head will soon be on the same block as Mr Karmi's, predict Palestinians (and several Israeli analysts), but fewer and fewer of them would disagree with his prognosis.
On January 18th Israeli tanks moved to within spitting distance of Mr Arafat's presidential offices in Ramallah. They are digging in permanent positions, suggesting the longest of stays. The army also reconquered 55% of the town, Mr Arafat's "temporary capital", and dynamited the PA's main radio station, a symbolic act aimed at silencing Palestinian "incitement". Palestinians fought back, first with stones and slingshots, then with guns, shooting randomly at nearby Jewish settlements and staging the occasional ambush on the tanks that now patrol Ramallah's streets. 
Worse will almost certainly come. Groups such as Hamas, Islamic Jihad and radical factions of the Palestine Liberation Organisation are already vowing "martyrdom" in response to the invasions. And Fatah-affiliated outfits like the al-Aqsa Brigades declared the ceasefire "a hoax" the moment Mr Karmi was killed.

The rubble in Tulkarm
As for their leader, Mr Arafat remains confined to his Ramallah headquarters, literally under the barrels of Israeli guns. He will neither flee nor resign, insist his aides. But all Palestinians are aware that, if there is one more operation like Hadera, Israel will be tempted to kick away the remaining stools on which their leader stands. 
Palestinian fears about Mr Sharon's intentions are increasingly converging with Israeli suspicions. Both on the Israeli right and the left, it is now widely assumed that the prime minister is determined to remove Mr Arafat from the picture. The main difference between the two camps' assessments is over whether Mr Sharon proposes to do away with the entire structure of the PA, or rather to engineer a more palatable leadership to replace Mr Arafat. Significantly, this analysis of Mr Sharon's intentions is provoking little outcry, or even much sustained criticism, within Israeli mainstream politics.
It is true that there was a good deal of embarrassed comment in the press over the army's large-scale destruction of Palestinian homes at a refugee camp on the Gaza-Egypt border earlier this month. Doveish voices also questioned the wisdom and timing of the assassination of Mr Karmi. Even Dalia Rabin-Pelossof, the Labour Party deputy defence minister and daughter of Yitzhak Rabin, an assassinated prime minister and peacemaker, suggested on January 21st that the government (of which she is a fairly central member) may have missed an opportunity to move from violence to negotiations by failing to capitalise on the relative calm that prevailed between mid-December and early January.
But such criticism is not having big political repercussions. On January 17th the Labour Party's central committee crushed a motion by Yossi Beilin, a former minister and indefatigable peace negotiator, to secede from the coalition government. Speaker after speaker pointed out that to quit now would inevitably be seen as support for Mr Arafat, and would be electoral suicide.


Green lights?
Reuters
Reuters
Tear gas for Israel
Mr Barghouti, the Fatah commander, believes that, in its plan to topple Mr Arafat, Israel has received a "green light" from the Americans. Mr Arafat has written to President George Bush asking him to send Anthony Zinni, America's Middle East envoy, back to the region. But the Americans say Mr Zinni's mediation efforts are presently "on hold". This silence worries Palestinians far more than Israeli tanks do. 
On the Israeli side, the idea that "Bush has had it with Arafat" has become axiomatic among aides to the prime minister. These Israeli officials say the episode of the arms-smuggling ship that Israel apprehended in the Red Sea three weeks ago convinced the Bush team of Mr Arafat's perennial perfidy.
Israeli gloating over Washington's purported or imminent dumping of Mr Arafat is probably unfounded, or at any rate premature. But Mr Sharon expects-and undisguisedly hopes-that the American administration will decide this week not to send Mr Zinni back to the region for the time being. Briefing the leadership of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the most important pro-Israeli lobby in Washington, the prime minister said the envoy's return would only "give the Palestinians hope that they can keep on shooting and also negotiate at the same time."
But if Mr Zinni's absence is indeed taken as American endorsement for a plan to oust Mr Arafat, and the plan succeeds, what then? The forecast of Ahmed Abdul Rahman, one of Mr Arafat's aides, may be biased, but at the moment it is hard to argue with: "suicidal armed chaos".

Most of you already know, but the move is taking place this Friday 11/16/01.  Please be sure you are packed by 3:00 PM on Friday and  have everything labeled.  They are moving both Power and Gas, so I am not sure what time the building will be open on Sunday or if it will be open at all.  I will get back to you with that information by Thursday.  If you have any questions or need help with anything, please let me know.

Thanks!

Weather Headlines
Friday February 1, 2002
The last of the warm air will be scoured out of the East today with near to
below normal temperatures for most of the country by early next week. A
very active Southern jet stream could spin up two more significant winter
storms through next weekend.
>From the looks of the models today, the pattern is about as active as it
gets. Imagine the possibilities if only there was more cold air in the mix.
While brutal air is still not expected, the potential for winter farther
South is on the increase next week. We will see a temporary break from the
storminess over the weekend. The current storm now in Pennsylvania will
move out to sea and drive colder air into the region. A cool and dry
weekend seems to be shaping up for most areas, but a weak low will drop out
of Canada, across the Lakes and toward New England on Sunday. The current
storm will probably drive out most of the available moisture, but some lake
effect is possible so some light snow amounts should occur. The next
Pacific wave comes ashore in a fairly harmless fashion initially. However,
the set up looks favorable for some sort of Low pressure to develop in the
vicinity of the Gulf coast early next week. It would head toward the SE US
and could be an interesting factor. As far as temperatures go, the high
pressure over the Western Plateau (Colorado and Utah) is keeping that
region in a trapped cold air mass. The Plains will slowly modify from the
current shallow arctic air in place while the East undergoes a rather
pronounced cooling to near if not slightly below normal levels, a far cry
from the record highs of the past two weeks.
The 6-10 day period looks colder for the nation as a whole than recent
weeks. I still don't see us bringing in any real brutal arctic air, but the
SE ridge that has been in place for much of January is no more. In all
cases, the models suppress the storm track to the Southern U.S. which opens
the door to another potentially major winter storm, but quite a bit farther
South than the last one. The solutions are all over the place which one
would expect this far out. One aspect that struck me as noteworthy was the
Canadian's depiction of a large arctic high over the Northern U.S. It has
had it for three runs in a row, but given the high surface pressures does
not look as cold as I would have expected. It's just another product of a
strange winter I suspect. So, while I still am not in any kind of arctic
camp on this, I do believe the areas of above normal temperatures will be
very limited. I look for most areas to run near or slightly below normal.
For the period Friday February 1 through Tuesday February 5, expect the
following temperature trends:
Average 4 to 6-degrees below normal: Central and Southern Rockies, Southern
and Central Plains, Intermountain West, Desert SW, California...
Average 1 to 3-degrees below normal: Northern Rockies, Pacific NW, Ohio and
Mississippi Valleys...
Average 1 to 3- degrees above normal: Great Lakes, Northeast..
Average 4 to 6-degrees above normal: Mid-Atlantic, Gulf Coast, Southeast...

Hi John,

I'm the one who's working with eric on the spread option price. Jared indicated you'd get him something today....could you tell me what your using for you vols (FGT/MKTAREA and correlations (between Z2/Z3, and between (Z2/Z3) and FGT/MKTAREA)? Also, once I've plugged in the numbers if you'd like to see my results, let me know.

thanks, 

cjc

Good morning my sugar, how are you.  I love and miss you very much.  I had a wonderful weekend with you.  You are so special.  I love you.  

I am feeling a little better, probably because I got up and around.  I am still a little weak but I think I will be okay.  

Have a great day and I will talk to you later.

The Piggy

You called me the other night.....on my mobile and at home....you also left
a message that you would
call back sometime this weekend...I called your house not 1 minute after you
called my mobile...you wouldn't answer....
I also left messages several times after that....If that is the best you can
do...then I don't need it....
Someone has to stand up and say that's not good enough!!!!!    Family
doesn't treat family that way!!!!!
Enough is enough!!!!!!!!!       My kids don't even know who Uncle  Johnny
Boy is any more...and that is a shame!!!!
I love you more than a real brother and I am truly sorry if this hurts your
feelings...hell, you might decide to even not talk to me any more....but it
sorta seems like you alraedy decided that...so I don't have anything to lose
by sending this...
I still love you whether you want to love me back or not.....Mike

Do you have time?  I have to call to see if it is ready.  I thank you for the offer.  I might take you up on it.

Did you listen to the CD?  Did you like it?  I saw them in concert in 92 at Fitzgeralds.  I stayed after the show and talked to them.  I was a big fan at the time.  I also saw them a couple of times at Numbers.  Have you ever been to Numbers?

call you, I do love and miss you as well, I do have some issues but they do
not involve you or the family, just some work mainly also some others as
well, I am sorry I didn't talk earlier, just real busy today, I will call
you around noon when things slow down.  Please forgive me.

I am sorry about the kids not knowing their uncle as well.  I will have to
change that.

Due to the change of servers and moving of all ERMS  databases to the new locations old curve fetch files are not working properly.

I got our IT guys to fix the file you gave me. Everything looks OK now.

I got the new file attached.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Enron debt sinks on credit crunch fears


By Nancy Leinfuss 

NEW YORK, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Bonds of Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ene&d=t> - news <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/e/ene.html>), which is trying to curb fears that it faces a credit crunch, fell sharply on Friday after The Wall Street Journal reported the energy giant on Thursday drew down about $3 billion from a credit line and is in talks with its banks about obtaining a new multibillion dollar credit line.

	

Houston-based Enron's new chief financial officer, Jeff McMahon, said late on Thursday that the company, the largest U.S. energy trader with $67.3 billion of assets, had drawn down from its credit lines to obtain more than $1 billion in cash to alleviate concerns about its liquidity. 

``There's been a lot of downward pressure on Enron following the negative news,'' said an investment-grade bond trader. ``Investment-grade accounts have been trying to exit those bonds, but there hasn't been any support from either high-yield or hedge funds.'' 

Enron did not immediately return calls seeking comment. 

Enron's investment-grade 6.40 percent notes due in 2006, which just two weeks ago were quoted to yield 2.3 percentage points more than five-year U.S. Treasuries, are now quoted at a dollar price, like junk bonds. They were bid Friday at 80 cents on the dollar, with a yield to maturity of 12.09 percent, or 8.34 percentage points more than Treasuries. 

Enron's 8.31 percent issue due 2003 fell a similar amount on Friday, and also trades at 80 cents on the dollar, traders said. 

The company's stock, meanwhile, has lost more than half of its value in the last two weeks as investors began questioning off-the-balance-sheet transactions between the company and two limited partnerships run by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. 

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is now looking at those transactions for possible conflicts of interest. 

Enron ousted Fastow on Wednesday. 

The shares were down $1.09, or 6.7 percent, at $15.26 in afternoon New York Stock Exchange trade. 

CREDIT RATINGS AT RISK 

On Thursday, credit rating agency Standard & Poor's revised Enron's outlook to negative while affirming its long- and short-term credit ratings of ``BBB-plus'' and ``A-2.'' 

S&P said it is closely monitoring Enron's capital needs and liquidity position, which it considers crucial to the success of the company's core business operations. 

``Assurances from the top levels of Enron management that the company will maintain its commitment to its credit quality and that no steps are being taken to support the company's common stock price at the expense of credit quality provide further support for Enron's ratings,'' S&P said. 

S&P said it revised its outlook after the big drop in Enron's market capitalization this week, which it said has hurt the company's financial flexibility and may impede management's ability to rebuild the balance sheet and sell assets in a timely manner. 

``The negative outlook acknowledges the potential for erosion of the company's credit quality as investor confidence in the company's management has waned,'' S&P said. 

Another credit rating agency, Fitch, on Thursday warned it may downgrade Enron's debt, saying the erosion of consumer confidence could block the company's access to capital markets.

Hey sugar, how are you doing?  Did you sleep okay?  I had weird dreams, I think because I ate then went straight to bed.  I am a puffy frog today.  Need to be popped.

I forgot about the option class that John is giving today @ 2pm, I don't know how long it will last, but I do want to join them.  I will probably learn something.

I hope you have a wonderful day, tell the crazies hi.  

Talk to you later my sugar, IT IS THE WEEKEND, YEAH.  I get to spend time with my baby.  Love you very much.

The Puffy Froggy Piggy

Just received this.  

Subject:	Highlights from this morning's ENE/DYN analyst conference call

Listened in on the analyst call this morning.  Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order.

The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  

Specific points:
EES will be a part of the new company.  
Enron assets will be revalued at closing.  
The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  
Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%.
Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  
ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  
Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  
In what was termed a "new approach", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  
Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.  
Lay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'.
All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.
Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure.
Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  
Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.
Dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there.
Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash.  
Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.
Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.
With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.
ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  
BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.
McMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.
Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won't be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.
Watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.
Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger.
Watson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. 
The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron's assets or businesses.  Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.
McMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements.
ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.
The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.
Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.
Initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities.  
McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.
Dynegy's earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.
Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.
ChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'.  (No further clarification given).
Whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the Enron traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.'
Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.
Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.

How do you like you new space?  is it okay?  I like being able to peak over and see you.  The table has turned.  You have to get up and look back to see me now.  Ha.

I bought you something small this weekend.  I will give it to you later.  It is nothing that important but I thought it was cute. 

Oh well, I guess I better work.

Have a great day and I hope to talk to you later.

Many of you have asked whether you should come into the office next week, especially if there is no guarantee of being paid for time worked after today.  We want to encourage you to come to work.  We continue to consider every option available to us as a company; and unfortunately, restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options.  Your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process.

I still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy.  But you should be aware that, in general, the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $4,650 per employee.  I want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices.  Additionally, Enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing. For Enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority.

We are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue.  Of course, until we finalize those business decisions, we cannot make that determination.  I know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you.  I can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so.

While terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment, we hope to do what we can to assist them.  We will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search.  We have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in Enron alumni.  We will share more information on these efforts soon.

I appreciate your continued patience and cooperation.

Ken

      didn't
      call you, I do love and miss you as well, I do have some issues but
   they

      not involve you or the family, just some work mainly also some others
   as
      well, I am sorry I didn't talk earlier, just real busy today, I will
      call
      you around noon when things slow down.  Please forgive me.

   up.

As you know, the U.S. government is investigating hundreds, if not thousands, of relatives, acquaintances and associates of the individuals who may have been involved in the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11.  We believe that the media will soon be reporting that one of the many individuals being questioned is an Enron employee in Houston.  It is appropriate for us to withhold judgment and to continue to cooperate fully with federal authorities.  Because this is a matter in the hands of the federal authorities, we cannot provide additional information at this time.   However, we will keep you informed, to the greatest extent possible. 

Please keep in mind that thousands of people who may or may not have any information about the terrorist attacks are being questioned as part of this investigation.  We continue to have every reason to believe that our employees and facilities are safe.  If you have concerns, please call Corporate Security at (713) 345-2804.  If you receive any media or external inquiries about this matter, please call Public Relations at (713) 853-5670.

At Enron, diversity is one of our strengths, and we respect and embrace all people of all faiths and beliefs.  Please continue to keep our employees who have been impacted by this tragedy in your thoughts and prayers.

*** Models continue to show a significant change just past the short range
period. The next few days can be used to prepare.***

     The current pattern is quite unusual to say the least. While it is
true that temperatures in the 60's and 70's are not uncommon in November
for a day or two at a time, some areas that would normally be in the 40's
this time of year have seen an almost uninterrupted streak of this for the
past two weeks. Look for several more days of occasional  20 to in some
cases 30 degree above normal temperatures in the North. The warm air will
rapidly spread into the NE as well and take up residence into early next
week. Most of the country is absent of any significant storminess, but the
periphery of the country is seeing some rain. It could get significant in
West Texas and Florida over the next couple of days.

     The 6-10 day period still looks to be on target for a significant
pattern change. Say goodbye to the zonal flow which is well North of its
normal November position. The models are targeting Monday-Tuesday for this
change to really get underway. A ridge sets up over the Western continent
which promotes a trough in the Central and East allowing Canadian air to
flow Southeast. My concerns to magnitude and duration remain, however a
change from 20-30 above normal to perhaps 5-10 below normal still must be
deemed "significant" in its own right. Even if my concerns are realized, I
would highly doubt that the widespread 60's and 70's in the North would
return. The Canadian model is most aggressive with developing some sort of
a "winter storm" for next week. I think the more likely scenario at this
time is a drier turn to colder weather. Lake effect snows are certainly a
possibility and some rain with the passage of the front could occur, but I
am not ready to jump upon the big storm bandwagon... not yet anyway.

For the period Wednesday November 14 through Sunday November 18, expect the
following temperature trends:

Average 1 to 3-degrees below normal: Southeast, Desert SW ?

Average 1 to 3-degrees above normal: Mid-Atlantic, Gulf Coast, California,
Pacific NW?

Average 4 to 6-degrees above normal: Northeast, Mississippi Valley,
Southern Rockies and Plains, Intermountain West?

Average 7 to 12-degrees above normal: Ohio Valley, Great Lakes, Central
Rockies and Plains?

Average 13 to 18-degrees above normal: Northern Rockies and Plains?

Hey sugar, good morning how are you doing?  Thanks for the ride into work.  I love and miss you very much.  I can't wait until this next weekend.  I found the car charger and it fits the phone, so we are set to keep the phone in the car.  That will be good for you.  I worry about you when you are alone.  Have a wonderful day and I will talk to you later.  Don't work too hard.  

Love you

Weather Headlines
Friday October 19 , 2001
***  Zonal flow keeps the short term quiet. Major jet stream amplification
expected in the medium range with arctic outbreak possible.***
     A weak cold front is crossing the Midwest today, but with very little
change in sensible weather. The only significant storminess over the next
several days would be a heavy rain threat over the Southern half of Florida
and a moderate rain threat in the Pacific NW. When I last wrote on Monday,
I discussed the potential for a trough to form in the Western U.S. It
clearly has not happened though I mentioned that a zonal flow would also
accomplish the forecasted warm up. This milder air should stay in place
into the middle of next week. The Western Atlantic ridge has also
strengthened in recent days which should force Gulf and East coast
temperatures to go above normal by early next week after a couple of more
coolish days. There are no named storms in the tropics at this time. A
couple of flare-ups in the Caribbean bear watching, but likely would not
develop until Monday at the earliest, if then.
Weather patterns in the 6-10 day range should become much more interesting
and bullish. All of the models forecast a strong dip of the polar jet to
occur into the Plains late next week. There are some discrepancies in the
intensity and how fast it moves East. However, given some very strong winds
in the Pacific and some very cold air now over the Arctic, I expect this to
be significant. Persistence also should pay off in this forecast. These
troughs have not had any problem digging into the Eastern U.S. since Labor
Day while troughs into the West have been non-existence. This could be
giving us clues on how the winter will go. The good news is that will aid
in verifying my winter outlook, the bad news is it could result in a long
season in the East. Specifics can wait until next week as the event gets
closer. A couple of highlights though would likely be accumulating snows in
the Northern U.S. and double digit below normal temperatures invading the
Plains and spreading East. As is usually the case, a strong trough in the
East results in significant ridging(with warmer, drier air) in the Western
U.S.
For the period October 19 through October 23, expect the following
temperature trends:
Average 1 to 3 degrees below normal: Gulf Coast, Ohio Valley, Northeast,
Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, Northern Rockies, Pacific NW...
Average 1 to 3-degrees above normal: Plains, Mississippi Valley,
California,  Central Rockies...
Average 4 to 6-degrees above normal: Desert SW, Intermountain West,
Southern Rockies...
Unspecified areas will average close to normal...

John,
 
We haven't had the chance to talk the last 2-3 days (only briefly today), so I just wanted you to know I haven't forgotten about you and I am doing what I can to get your stuff finished alongside my other to-do items.  
 
As we discussed this evening, I know I still owe you your desired modifications to the input screens.  I believe we are functionally there, you just want some "look and feel" modifications.  Let me know if this you think of something different.
 
Also, if you begin using the valuation model again tomorrow morning, let me know how it goes (accuracy, morning macro, etc).  I really want this in production and I want it to be successful for you.
 
Hopefully things go well with the mods I've done to the valuation stuff.
 
Greg

Trade press, recruiting firms and others recently have made numerous calls to Enron employees seeking information about the company, its employees and other matters.  In some cases, these callers have used false identities, as in, "I'm from the SEC and I need you to provide me with?"

If you receive a call from someone identifying themselves as part of a government organization, please refer the caller to the legal department.  Please refer calls from the trade press and other media inquiries to the Public Relations group.  And otherwise, please treat Enron information as confidential.

Thank you.

I hope that you foot is okay.  You need to be careful.  I liked the shoes though.  It is too bad you can't wear heels.  You look really good in them.  I guess no more hoochi wear for right now huh?

wearing those heels yesterday was a bad idea.   they were killing me all night.  i had to take them off.   and then when i woke up this morning my ankle was swollen and bruised.  went to the dr earlier and she said i most likely injured a tendon or ligament.    great.  no heels for a while.

Weather Headlines
Thursday October 25, 2001
*** Powerhouse storm is about to exit. The coldest air of the season is
about to enter. A significant warm up will commence late in the period.***
     The "storm of the century", "Superstorm", or whatever you want to call
yesterdays event was over-hyped a bit in my opinion, but significant in
some respects. There were some large tornadoes in Northern Indiana and the
surface low pressure center had one of the lowest readings I have seen in
an October storm. Otherwise, it was a squall line of t-storms with a turn
to colder and windier weather, things we have certainly seen before and
will see again. The cold front should reach the Atlantic coastline later
today and another line of t-storms may certainly go up along it. We also
have some measurable snow in Minnesota this morning and could see "some"
lake effect snows through Friday. Once this storm is off the field, the
only inclement weather threats appear to be the PNW from a trough in the
Gulf of Alaska and in Florida from something tropical. I do not mean from a
named storm or hurricane, but merely that the disturbance originated in the
Caribbean. A large polar air mass has swept in behind this storm insuring a
drier and cooler than normal pattern from the Mississippi River and East
through the weekend. The Plains start to warm early next week is ridging
starts to evolve in response to troughing off the West Coast. Neither of
these features look particularly strong in the short term and overall
weather in the West has a benign look to it.
I don't have a lot of change from yesterdays 6-10 day outlook other than
advancing things by one day. Warming that kicks in for the Plains advances
East. Relative to normal this will be more pronounced initially in the
North than the South though by late in the period all will share. I
mentioned an atmospheric turnaround yesterday and still feel there is
potential by the middle of next week to become almost as warm as the recent
warm episode. The pattern remains progressive, but not as volatile as
recent weeks. Charts show another trough pushing through the Plains and
Eastern U.S. but it does not have the amplitude that the current one does.
Therefore, it can't tap the arctic air and bring it down. I have a fairly
high confidence level that the first week of November will be mild for the
nation as a whole.
For the period October 25 through October 29, expect the following
temperature trends:
Average 7 to 9-degrees below normal: Great Lakes,  Ohio and Mississippi
Valleys...
Average 4 to 6-degrees below normal: Plains, Northeast, Mid-Atlantic...
Average 1 to 3 degrees below normal: Gulf Coast, Southeast, Rockies,
Pacific NW...
Average 1 to 3-degrees above normal: California, Intermountain West, Desert
SW...
Unspecified areas will average close to normal...

Weather Headlines
Friday November 16, 2001

*** Another mild November weekend in store before changes occur to usher in
Thanksgiving.***

     Folks in West Texas or perhaps along the SE coast may disagree with
their rain and/or wind of recent days, but the pattern over the Lower 48
remains remarkably quiet and warm. It should remain that way until the end
of this five day outlook period. However, changes are brewing in Canada
that will send a cold front down the Plains and East for early next week.
True arctic air still appears limited in my view, but a sizeable
temperature drop East of the Rockies is still expected. It begins in the
Northern Plains late Sunday and gets to the East coast by Thanksgiving.

There is suddenly a lot of model spread in regard to the middle and end of
next week. I am not going to make any changes to my thinking until perhaps
next week because if I average the extremes I am seeing the result is close
to my earlier forecast. As for the extremes, the Canadian continues to be
in the winter camp. The second cold shot it develops by Thanksgiving in the
Plains looks way overdone to me. On the other hand the European and MRF
have a rapid warming underway in the Plains. I have said repeatedly that I
think the upcoming cold is a fairly quick shot in its extreme, but clearly
the main jet stream will be suppressed farther South making a rapid warming
suspect as well. So, until I see more evidence to the contrary, a general
forecast in the near to slightly below normal camp still looks good to me.
Some models suggest a winter storm of some significance is possible for the
East next week. I can sure see some potential of Lake effect and Interior
Mountain snows, but I am not ready to forecast this event for the I95
corridor.

For the period Friday November 16 through Tuesday November 20, expect the
following temperature trends:

Average 1 to 3-degrees below normal: Southern Plains ?

Average 1 to 3-degrees above normal: Southeast, Mid-Atlantic, Desert SW,
 California, Pacific NW?

Average 4 to 6-degrees above normal: Gulf Coast, Mississippi Valley,
Southern Rockies, Intermountain West?

Average 7 to 10-degrees above normal: Northeast, Ohio Valley, Great Lakes,
Central Rockies and Plains?

Average 11 to 15-degrees above normal: Northern Rockies and Plains?

Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. 

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An "Alliance MX turret quick reference guide" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as "Caller ID" and "Voicemail Indication".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:
 
Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	
Weather Channel	12401	801	
CNN Headlines News	12402	802	
CNN Financial News	12403	803	
CNBC	12404	804	
MSNBC	12405	805	
Bloomberg	12406	806	
Financial News Network	12407	807	
CNN	12408	808	
Fox Sports	12409	809	
ESPN1	12410	810	


Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network "in-building" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible "Plug n Play" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.

Keeping an Open forum
We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com

Hey sugar, what is going on?  I love and miss you.  Today is the
weekend.  Yippee.  I cant wait.  Enron stock is now below $5.  I think
that that is not good, however, as long as our credit rating stays where
it is, then we are okay.  We will see.
By the way sugar, Mike just asked me to play golf at 7:40 am friday
morning.  Do you mind if I play?  It is not a big deal but I would like
to spend some time with mike outside of work, especially in light of
what is going on.  Just let me know.
Love you
The Pigs

In order for UBS Warburg to timely process your paycheck, I am requesting that all employee's accepting offers return any outstanding forms to my new desk location at  05852 on the 5th floor of ECS (Look for the Hamburg Flag) by noon this Friday  2/01/02.  This will prevent any benefit deductions from having to be "Double Deducted" on future checks.  Please attach a deposit slip or voided check stub to your direct deposit form.  Attached below are the forms needed for payroll/benefits, in case you did not turn these in at Orientation.  Lastly, please verify that your EHRonline home address is showing your current home address because all live checks will be mailed to your home residence. 

    

Thanks, Tony Jarrett

Hi John,
I hope things are going well for you. Sorry I could not contact you earlier
- had been really busy wrapping up things. Thanks for stopping the other day
and inquiring about me. I have an H-1 visa and have 6 weeks to find a job
after which I will be required to leave the country.

I am attaching a copy of my resume for you to review. I would appreciate
greatly if you could go over it and offer any suggestions on how I can
improve my chances of finding a job.

Thanks,
Bilal

Sure of course I understand Angelica.  I love your Lacoste vintage also!  As for the Fila warm-up, I've been looking long time for one and can never find right size/cond.  This one seems it.  So perhaps I will be lucky in the end.  My offer would be for $400 + if you're wondering........or change your mind this one little time.
Best,
Todd

Thanks Todd.  Appreciate your interest.  Once I pulled an auction and hurt a very good customer's feelings who wanted the item.  Don't want to do that again, thus my policy of never ending auctions early, even if the offers have been very tempting : )  Take care.

Hey sugar, I am still at work, just waiting on the IT people to set up a new
folder in the UBS directory so that I can move all my files over.  Once that
is done I will be leaving.  I will probably go directly to the Container
Store.  Just let me know if that is okay.

Are you getting hungry?  Do you want me to bring something?  Or do you want
to eat at home.

Love you

The Pigs

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee. However, because these buses passes are fully subsidized they must be treated as "taxable" income. Excluding the first $65 of the bus pass, the remaining value is subject to taxation, collectively referred to as "imputed tax". See example below

Example: A $100 pass is chosen by an employee. 

Subsidy for Bus Pass		$100.00
Exclusion amount			$  65.00

Taxable Income amount		$  35.00

Hi John,
Hope you had great holidays. I just wanted to update you on my progress. I
returned on Jan 6th after taking some time off from job search and have been
in active discussion with MRE Consulting and Dynegy. Although I have not
received an offer from either I am hopeful.

At Caminus I emailed Debbie and unfortunately I could not set up a time to
meet her before New Years. She has been on vacation since then and i am
looking forward to meeting her when she gets back. I think after Caminus I
would feel comfortable making a decision.

Do you have any suggestions/thoughts? Once again thanks a lot for looking
out for me!
Bilal

Hey sugar, what is going on?  I love and miss you.  Nothing happening here
just yet.  John and Mike are out until 1 or 1:30, hopefully I will find
something out then.  I bet that I won't find anything out for a couple of
days though.  Anyway, have a great day.  Talk to you soon.

Love you

Subject: Just sending a Parachute your way..........
Parachute 
Charles Plumb was a U.S. Navy jet  pilot in Vietnam. After 75 combat missions, his plane was destroyed by a  surface-to-air missile. Plumb ejected and parachuted into enemy hands. He was  captured and spent 6 years in a communist Vietnamese prison.  He survived  the ordeal and now lectures on lessons learned from that experience. 
One  day, when Plumb and his wife were sitting in a restaurant, a man at 
another  table came up and said, "You're Plumb! You flew jet fighters in 
Vietnam from  the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk.  You were shot down!" 
"How in the  world did you know that?" asked Plumb. "I packed your parachute," 
the man  replied. Plumb gasped in surprise and gratitude. The man pumped his 
hand and  said, "I guess it worked!" Plumb assured him, "It sure did. If your chute  
hadn't worked, I wouldn't be here today." 
Plumb couldn't sleep that  night, thinking about that man. Plumb says, "I kept wondering what he might have  looked like in a Navy uniform: a white hat, a bib in 
the back, and  bell-bottom trousers. I wonder how many times I might have seen 
him and not  even said 'Good morning, how are you?' or anything because, you see, 
I was a  fighter pilot and he was just a sailor." Plumb thought of the many hours the  sailor had spent on a long wooden table in the bowels of the ship, carefully  weaving the shrouds and folding the silks of each chute, holding in his hands  each time the fate of someone he didn't know. 
Now, Plumb asks his  audience, "Who's packing your parachute?" Everyone has 
someone who provides  what they need to make it through the day.  Plumb 
also points out that  he needed many kinds of parachutes when his plane was shot 
down over enemy  territory-he needed his physical parachute, his mental 
parachute, his  emotional parachute, and his spiritual parachute. He called 
on all these  supports before reaching safety. 
Sometimes in the daily challenges that  life gives us, we miss what is really important. We may fail to say hello,  please, or thank you, congratulate someone 
on something wonderful that has  happened to them, give a compliment, or just do something nice for no reason. As  you go through this week, this month, this year, 
recognize people who pack  your parachute.  I am sending you this as my way of thanking you for your  part in packing my parachute !!!    And I hope you will send it  on to those who have helped pack yours! 
Sometimes, we wonder why friends  keep forwarding jokes to us without writing a word, maybe this could explain:  When you are very busy, but still want to keep in 
touch, guess what you do -     --you forward jokes. And to let you know that you are still  remembered, you are still important, you are still loved, you are still cared  for, 
guess what you get? --- A forwarded joke. 
So my friend, next  time if you get a joke, don't think that been sent just another forwarded joke,  but that you've been thought of today and your friend on the other 
end of  your computer wanted to send you a smile.

John,

just as a heads-up, my prelim. results, using a correlation of .75 and vol of 1.5 X of NYMEX gives me:

put: $0.515/MMBtu
call: $0.818/MMBtu

I used $0.06 as the strike.

Hi John,

I'm the one who's working with eric on the spread option price. Jared indicated you'd get him something today....could you tell me what your using for you vols (FGT/MKTAREA and correlations (between Z2/Z3, and between (Z2/Z3) and FGT/MKTAREA)? Also, once I've plugged in the numbers if you'd like to see my results, let me know.

Sure of course I understand Angelica.  I love your Lacoste vintage also!  As for the Fila warm-up, I've been looking long time for one and can never find right size/cond.  This one seems it.  So perhaps I will be lucky in the end.  My offer would be for $400 + if you're wondering........or change your mind this one little time.
Best,

Thanks Todd.  Appreciate your interest.  Once I pulled an auction and hurt a very good customer's feelings who wanted the item.  Don't want to do that again, thus my policy of never ending auctions early, even if the offers have been very tempting : )  Take care.

WSJ(1/14) UBS Emerges As Top Bidder For Enron Trading Unit 		

01/14/2002
Dow Jones News Services
(Copyright ? 2002 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)


  By Mitchell Pacelle and Rebecca Smith 
  Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal 

UBS AG, the giant Swiss financial firm, emerged the apparent victor to acquire Enron Corp.'s North American energy-trading operation. Enron hopes the deal will breathe new life into its dormant trading business, once the generator of 90% of the Houston company's profit. 

But obstacles to resurrecting the business remain formidable, as indicated by the fact there were only two serious bidders -- UBS and Citigroup Inc. Enron wouldn't see any serious money from the UBS deal for at least a year, indicating how difficult it will be for the energy company's creditors to recover what they are owed. Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court protection on Dec. 2, the largest such filing ever, shielding the company from creditors as it seeks to reorganize. 

Under the terms of the deal, which is subject to bankruptcy-court approval, Enron would transfer to UBS Warburg, the investment banking arm of UBS, its wholesale energy-trading operation, including a staff of roughly 800 people and computer systems and hardware that comprised its once-mighty EnronOnline Internet-based trading platform. UBS wouldn't be acquiring any of Enron's huge book of trading positions which gradually would be unwound. It also wouldn't provide any cash upfront to Enron. 

Instead, UBS would pay royalties to Enron amounting to one-third of the energy-trading enterprise's pretax profit for a 10-year period, according to Enron. UBS would have an option to eliminate the royalty payments through the payment to Enron of money in years three, four and five. UBS would pay Enron 5.75 times Enron's prior-year payment for each one-third share of royalty eliminated. As such, it could completely eliminate Enron's royalty payments by the end of the fifth year. 

As incentive to buy out Enron, UBS's royalty payments otherwise would increase by 10% from years five through 10, up to a maximum of 44% share of pretax profit. 

Enron Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon said yesterday that he felt it was a "grand-slam great deal" for creditors since new life is being breathed into a "perishable commodity." Enron's staff had been kept together largely on the basis of retention bonuses that expire at the end of February. The trading operation effectively suspended operations prior to Enron's Chapter 11 filing last month. 

Enron had hoped to bring in a credit-worthy partner to take a 51% stake in a new trading joint venture, leaving the energy company with a 49% stake. But Mr. McMahon said no bidder was interested in that deal. There also were no bids for the trading operation from rival energy or energy-trading companies. One possible reason was that resuscitating Enron's vast trading business would require a top credit rating, lots of capital to back trading operations and an expert credit-risk department to keep track of what traders are doing and to constantly revalue the trading book. 

Since the Enron debacle, other energy-trading firms have taken pains to show they are de-emphasizing commodity-like trading of electricity, which Enron pioneered, and are instead concentrating on selling their own output of energy products and entering into contracts to protect themselves against price volatility. 

Mr. McMahon said he feels that "by virtue of a AA-plus bank purchasing this business, it changes the landscape of the energy-merchant business forever" by putting more clout in the hands of institutions with top credit ratings. UBS apparently hasn't committed to provide any set level of capital. There is no determination, yet, for how royalty payments would be divided among Enron's thousands of creditors. 

The largest question, though, is whether the trading business can truly be revived. Although Enron's global wholesale division, which included as its biggest component the North American energy-trading operations, generated about $3 billion in pretax profit during the first nine months of 2001, it has been dormant now for more than a month. Martin Bienenstock, Enron's lead bankruptcy lawyer, characterized the deal as "the sale of something that was dead that we are trying to bring back to life." 

Competitors say they think a certain amount of Enron's trades were conducted at very thin margins in order to build volume, and that such trading practice likely will disappear. "You'll see the churn going away," says Michael McNally, chief financial officer of TXU Corp., now the biggest electricity trader in Texas. He thinks EnronOnline has "significant value but there's only a limited number of people who would know how to use it." Scaled to transact trades on hundreds of types of contracts, the platform is oversized for most uses. 

UBS Warburg, which bought PaineWebber in 2000, has looked to expand its U.S. market share, and the Enron deal would provide entry into energy trading. John Costas, chief executive of UBS Warburg, said Friday the Enron unit would be "a valuable extension of our world-wide trading activities." 

The winner of the auction, held under the bankruptcy court's supervision, was announced shortly after noon Friday in a packed Manhattan courtroom, less than an hour after the two bidders had submitted final offers. Enron's advisers and its creditors committee, which endorsed the UBS deal, had negotiated nonstop for more than 24 hours. In addition to Citigroup, which Mr. McMahon said competed "neck and neck" with UBS, BP PLC, the British oil company, had submitted a $25 million bid for the computer settlement support system of the Enron unit. 

The proposed UBS transaction is subject to approval by Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York, who officially closed the auction to new bidders Friday. A hearing is set for Thursday at which creditors will have an opportunity to voice objections. 

Separately Friday, Judge Gonzalez declined to transfer the bankruptcy case to Houston, denying motions from several creditors who had argued that Enron's headquarters city was a more suitable venue.

If you're receiving this email its because we're still waiting on a response from you.  Please reply to this message ASAP.  See below for details.

Thanks,

We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. 

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your "native" desktop (stand alone computer).

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding "1" or a "2" in the subject field.

If you're not sure which one you have, please contact myself x39673, Teresa Mandola x39807 or Jennifer McQuade x53614 and we'll come by your desk to help you.

Thank you,

Dan Diamond

John,

Can you be my reviewer for the Performace Evaluation Process. I worked on adding Asian model (calendar days) into PortCalc. 

I know you are very busy. But I'll have to have several reviewers from users we support... I'd appreciate it very much. Thanks a lot.

Best regards,

Shouan

The post id is 1119231.  Please let me know what the value is currently and then what the value is with the change.  Will these values be based on last nights prices, volatilities, skew ...?  

Thanks and let me know if you have any questions.

Hi John,

I'm the one who's working with eric on the spread option price. Jared indicated you'd get him something today....could you tell me what your using for you vols (FGT/MKTAREA and correlations (between Z2/Z3, and between (Z2/Z3) and FGT/MKTAREA)? Also, once I've plugged in the numbers if you'd like to see my results, let me know.

thanks, 

cjc

As you know, the Ostrip Functionality has been altered.  This change has affected the way the larryoptmodel values the gas daily options.  The reason the larryoptmodel is affected is because the larryoptmodel was defining the inputs to the Ostrip model differently than the documentation asked.  Let me explain.  The Ostrip Model has the following date inputs:

NowToSet 	- Fixed Price = zero
		- Forward Start = days from now until strike is set

BegDays	- Fixed Price = days from now until start of option
		- Forward Start = days from when strike is set until start of option

EndDays	- Fixed Price = days from now until end of option
		- Forward Start = days from when strike is set until end of option

FwdStFlag	- Fixed Price = 0
		- Forward Start = 1

The Ostrip model should overlook the NowToSet days if the FwdStFlag = 0 (fixed price option).  It assumes the option is set right now.  The "Old Ostrip Model" did not overlook this input.  This is the problem.  In Larryoptmodel, the NowToSet is the same for Fixed Price options and Forward Start Options, the BegDays is the same and the EndDays is the same.  Thus when the "Old Ostrip Model" incorrectly used the NowToSet days, this made the Larryoptmodel value the option correctly.  When the "New Ostrip Model" was put into production, this model overlooks the NowToSet date, thus giving an incorrect value in Larryoptmodel.

Larryoptmodel has to be changed to reflect the above inputs.  It is actually only a change to one date.  This date will be used in calculating the three days above.  If the option is a fixed price option then the date will be today and NowToSet will be Today minus Today (zero), BegDays will be Start of Option minus today, EndDays will be End of Option minus today.  If the option is a forward start option, then the date will be when the strike is set and the NowToSet with be the strike setting date minus today, BegDays will be Start of Option minus the strike date, EndDays will be the End of Option minus strike date.

It is important to note that it is unexcusable to make any changes to the models without consulting the traders first.  If there was a problem with the "Old Ostrip Model" then the trader should have been notified right away.  This could have meant that the options were being misvalued when trading.  In this case, however, Larry had figured a way around this problem and he was valuing correctly.  When the model was changed, that changed the larryoptmodel valuation and now it was being valued incorrectly.  Either way, any problems with the models should be communicated with the traders right away.  Any changes to the models should be communicated to the traders before they are made.

Please let me know if any have any questions or concerns.  Thanks.

John

We are getting ready for the launch of "NetcoOnline" and have been preparing new documentation, a refreshed site design and cleaned products to reflect our Gas and Power focus.

The following timetable could change, but the general sequence should apply in any case:

Week of Jan 14:

Upon approval by the new buyer of the PA and ETA formats, we will contact the Master Users at our Top 50 customers and send them copies of the final PA and ETA forms with our new buyer's name filled in. During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have an approved PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch "NetCoOnline".

A Splash page will be available within two business days of knowing our new company name, on a web page reached via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of "NetCoOnline" and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub users.

The Splash page will look something like the following:

 


A Press Release will be issued which will include the planned launch date of "NetcoOnline"

Week of Jan. 21:

If all goes well, "NetcoOnline" will be launched on Tuesday, January 22, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues).

We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for NetcoOnline. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.

General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.
		

Trading/Origination Coordination

Certain individuals in the Trading and Origination groups will be contacting customers on our Top 50 list to introduce the new company and begin the process of getting signed PA's. The NetcoOnline marketing team will work with Trading and Origination groups to make sure that all Master Users that previously had EnronOnline North American Gas and Power execution rights are contacted within one week of the PA and ETA being approved by the new buyer.  NetcoOnline Marketing will follow up with the Master Users to make sure PA's are signed and returned.


NetcoOnline Marketing Contacts:

For Marketing-specific questions, please use the following contacts. For other questions, please contact Bob Shults (30397) or Dave Forster (31861).

Weather Headlines
Monday January 28, 2002
Summer-type ridge in the SE to get beaten down by approaching U.S. storm.
Trough to develop in the East turning the pattern to a normal to below
normal temperature regime.
We are looking at a deep trough in the West and strong ridge in the East on
this mornings weather maps. Dozens of record highs were set this weekend
from the Plains eastward while it was cold enough in the NW for snow in
Seattle. Things are on the move now which should end the warmth for most
areas by the end of the week. Relative to recent weeks, it certainly looks
a lot colder, but when one considers the time of year and steps back, well
most areas just don't get that cold. This looks to me to be the type of
situation where it will be colder in the Plains and then modify as it heads
East. This has a similar feel to what happened in late December. At the
moment, we are devoid of snow cover, so I have a difficult time getting too
pumped up over all of this. Speaking of snow, the Western U.S. system may
produce some moderate snows over the far North and Lakes as it pushes from
the High Plains NE to Canada. This does not appear to be a situation that
favors any East Coast winter storm development. Short term numbers will
still show warmth in the East, but that is a function of the next couple of
days. The Western and Central U.S. temperature departures are already below
normal and that trend will shift East later this week.
The 6-10 day period looks chilly, but hardly cold and also may be very
quiet. The SE ridge is replaced by a trough in the means so we should not
see the recent spring regime. The trend over the Western part of the
continent ( US and Canada) is for Pacific zonal flow. The real bitter cold
that has been in Canada the last several weeks should gradually modify. We
will likely see two distinct branches in the jet stream, an arctic branch
in the North and subtropical branch in the South. We get our big storms and
bitter cold outbreaks when they phase(come together). Most of the extreme
forecasts you see come together when this phasing occurs. I can not rule
out in the future, but it looks unlikely to me for now. To me the bottom
line for this period( and beyond) is for a slight cold bias East and a
close to normal look elsewhere.
For the period Monday January 28 through Friday February 1, expect the
following temperature trends:
Average 4 to 6-degrees below normal: Intermountain West, Desert SW,
California, Pacific NW...
Average 1 to 3- degrees below normal: Plains and Rockies...
Average 4 to 9-degrees above normal: Great Lakes, Mississippi Valley...
Average 10 to 15-degrees above normal: Ohio Valley, Mid-Atlantic,
Northeast, Gulf Coast, Southeast...

The Will to Persevere (Abraham Lincoln) 2.012

Next time you want to quit, remember this chronology from the life of one of
America's greatest Presidents, Abraham Lincoln:

In 1831, he failed in business.
One year later, he was defeated for state legislator.
In 1833, he tried again in business. And failed again.
In 1835, his fianc?e died.
In 1836, he had a nervous breakdown.

In 1843, Lincoln ran for congress and was defeated.
In 1848, he tried again, and lost again.
In 1855, he ran for the Senate, and lost.
One year later, he ran for Vice President, and lost.
In 1859, he ran again for the Senate, and was defeated.

And in 1860, he was elected President of the United States.

"The difference between history's boldest accomplishments, and its most
staggering failures is often, simply, the diligent will to persevere."

Weather Headlines
Thursday January 24, 2002
The pattern looks more springlike than winter in the short term. Models
converging on an arctic air invasion next week. I am nibbling, but not
quite biting yet.
There is no denying the recent warmth. Temperatures overnight in parts of
the East approached 40 degrees above normal. While we do have a cold front
moving in, the cooling is moderate at best and very short in duration.
Temperatures are already rebounding in the Plains and will blow East this
weekend into next week. Five day numbers will remain well above normal. I
believe the West remains in a below normal mode. The flow is wet and
alternating between zonal off the Pacific and NW out of Western Canada.
Either way it is chilly and rain could come deep into Southern California
with very heavy Intermountain Snows.
I am once again nibbling at some arctic cold in the 6-10 day period. It is
encouraging to see the models in pretty good agreement. The cold has been
in Canada all along and the trough may finally migrate into the Plains and
become deep enough. Stopping me is recent history and the fact the Canadian
and European solutions do not bring the center of high pressure across the
border. The MRF brings it well South, but I find that unlikely. I also
believe a split flow will develop in the jet stream with two distinct jets.
One will run across the Southern U.S. with the polar jet across the North.
This may help to spin up a winter storm during the period. Its my opinion
we will finally see the coldest air of the season invade the Northern
Plains with subzero cold from Nebraska northward. This may expand East to
the Great Lakes by the end of the period and to the Eastern U.S. in a
modified form after Day 10. I do not anticipate a significant arctic cold
to go into the Pacific NW at this time though they will remain below
normal. The SE ridge should hold until just after this period so much of
the Southern and Eastern U.S. will grade out above to well above normal
this period. I should also point out that overall I am considering this a
glancing blow of cold air, not an all out pattern change. My winter
forecast from October indicated a feeling on my part that one or two
significant arctic airmasses would invade. Its certainly taken awhile and
this will definitely be a factor farther North, but this appears to be one
of those airmasses. A quick attempt to quantify this: I could see readings
as low as -25 along the Canadian border (ND and MN) with subzero lows to
Omaha and Chicago. This would be the middle or latter part of next week. I
hesitate to go that cold farther South because this is still 5+ days away
and we are absent of snowcover.
For the period Thursday January 24 through Monday January 28, expect the
following temperature trends:
Average 4 to 6-degrees below normal: Intermountain West, Desert SW,
California...
Average 1 to 3- degrees below normal: Pacific NW...
Average 1 to 3-degrees above normal: Southern Plains and Rockies...
Average 4 to 9-degrees above normal: Gulf Coast, Southeast, Central Plains,
Mississippi Valley, Northern and Central Rockies...
Average 10 to 15-degrees above normal: Northern Plains, Great Lakes, Ohio
Valley, Mid-Atlantic, Northeast...

With the filing of the Hart-Scott-Rodino application last week, it looks like our updated launch timeline is as follows. Note that it is still possible that this timeline could shift:

Week of Jan 28:

We will distribute a packet to each of the Originators/Traders who have volounteered to call customers and assist in getting signed Password Applications. The packets will contain:

Key Messages
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Top Counterparty Checklist 
External Customer Cover Letter
Password Application (PA)
Registration Form
Fax Cover Sheet for PA/Registration 
Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA)
Internal online Marketing Contact List

Each person receiving a pack will contact the Master Users at the companies they have volounteered for and send them copies of the Password Application (PA) and Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA). During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have a signed PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch the new site.

A Splash page will be available at www.UBSWenergy.com or via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of www.UBSWenergy.com and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub Users.

The Splash page will look something like the following:

 


Week of Feb. 4:

We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for the site. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.

Week of Feb. 11:

The site will launch, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues). 

General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.
		

Trading/Origination Coordination

The Top 50 customers will have at least an initial contact within the first two days of starting the marketing effort and that all customers who previously traded either gas or power will receive a mailing within the first 10 days. An online marketer has been assigned as coordinator for each company and will assist each Trader/Originator in following up with Master Users as necessary to make sure PA's are signed and returned.

You do not have to apologize to me.  I understand completely.  It is stress=
ful for me as well.  I hope your little friend doesn't bother you too much.

By the way, if you don't feel like picking me up at the dealership I unders=
tand.  It is a fairly long drive for you.  Just let me know.  Thanks.

i dont know why, but at first it felt a little awkward yesterday when we we=
re going into my house.  it felt as though i was sneaking a boy into my roo=
m.  i hope i didnt make you feel uncomfortable.  i was so happy that you ca=
me by and that i was able to see you and hold you comfortably at last.  i g=
uess i didnt really know how to react b/c my roommates were home.  dont get=
 me wrong.  they are really awesome people.  they dont care who comes over.=
  i think it has been quite a while since i brought "male"company over thou=
gh.  they probably would have been excited for me.  i think it was just me =
who was feeling strange.  i am really really close to my cousin shelly, but=
 i dont really want her to know what is going on between us.  i guess i sti=
ll feel somewhat awkward with you being married and all and then being at m=
y house - and with things progressing as they are between us.  i just feel =
strange.   like this "feels right", but it "is not right".  i really enjoy =
being with you,  but i guess i'd be much more at ease if you were not attac=
hed.  i am sorry to mention this all over again.  i know it is the last thi=
ng you need to hear on a monday morning.  i dont know what your plans are -=
 and you probably dont know what your plans for the future are as your marr=
iage is concerned.  and you dont  need to answer me.  i am not asking for a=
n answer or explanation - just venting i guess.   i hope you understand whe=
re i am coming from.   do you ever experience this?   this odd feeling that=
 i am experiencing?

i dont know.  maybe i dont know what i am talking about.   maybe b/c "my li=
ttle friend" is visiting i tend to be a little more sensitive than usual.  =
 i feel so uncomfortable today - maybe that is more info than you need to k=
now, right now.   sorry......i guess its a female thing.......  : - (

well i hope that the rest of your day goes well.=20

Hey what is going on?  How did you sleep last nite.  I didn't sleep well.  =
I had weird dreams.  Anyway, I had a wonderful time yesterday.  I hope you =
did as well.  You have a very nice room.  Everything a person needs.  A nic=
e soft bed, a tv, a closet, a computer and a nice soft bed, oh did I mentio=
n that already, I guess that is on my mind. =20

Have a wonderful day and I will talk to you soon.

I might need a ride today, are you still okay with that?  I have to call th=
e dealership when they open.  Thank you for offering.

We are working on an EnronOnline Website Audit.  We have noticed that many traders have duplicate ID's and are not using some of them.  In an effort to reduce risk, we would like to inactivate all ID's that are no longer valid for traders.  Please note that inactivating these ID's will not effect matrix trades.  Please review the following information and let us know if this is a valid book and ID.

Natural Gas Price (Non-Affiliate) book
User ID:  ADM10158

Thank you,

Karen O'Day

Good morning my sugar, how are you.  I love and miss you very much.  I
had a wonderful weekend with you.  You are so special.  I love you.  
I am feeling a little better, probably because I got up and around.  I
am still a little weak but I think I will be okay.  
Have a great day and I will talk to you later.
The Piggy

Gearing up for first move-in to the new building. My mom also had a stroke in the spring and that's taking huge amounts of time. I'm hanging in there. Certainly can't complain in these times.

Hope you're doing well.

John,
 
I found the error.  It was a small logic error.
 
You can easily fix the problem if you go into the visual basic editor for the blotter file.  In the editor, you will see several modules listed on the left of the screen under the file.  You will need to edit the "Main_Query" module.
 
Once in the "Main_Query" module, you will need to search for the routine named "VerifyManualInputs".  The actual start of the routine looks like this:
 
Function VerifyManualInputs(FromDate As String, ToDate As String, PutCall As String, Lots As String, Strike As String, Price As String, CParty As String, sType As String) As Boolean

 
Within this routine, about 15-20 lines down, you should see the following two lines :
 
  If (isdate(FromDate) And isdate(ToDate)) Then
    If (ToDate < FromDate) Then
 
You need to change the second line to :
    
    If (CDate(ToDate) < CDate(FromDate)) Then
 
This should fix the problem.  The intent of the line is to prevent the "To Date" of a deal from being earlier than the "From Date".  In the original line of code, it does a TEXT based compare (like comparing is "ABC" < "DEF") instead of comparing the two values as DATES.  The modification I've laid out converts the from and to dates to date values before comparing.
 
I have tested the fix here and it should work fine.
 
I hope everything runs smooth for you next week.
 
Have a good Thanksgiving.
 
Greg

Not much going on over here.  Just hanging out waiting on the sale of the trade group.  I have interviewed with a couple of people.  I have one offer, not taking it yet though.  I think I would be giving up too much over here at Enron at this time.  Anyway, things are okay.

No I do not know Cassandra Shultz.  Is she from Enron?

Happy New Year and take care.  Tell Debby hi.  Talk to you soon.

John

I hope that you foot is okay.  You need to be careful.  I liked the shoes though.  It is too bad you can't wear heels.  You look really good in them.  I guess no more hoochi wear for right now huh?

wearing those heels yesterday was a bad idea.   they were killing me all night.  i had to take them off.   and then when i woke up this morning my ankle was swollen and bruised.  went to the dr earlier and she said i most likely injured a tendon or ligament.    great.  no heels for a while.

A backup seat and a backup computer have been assigned to you.  Please read this communication in detail.


Purpose:  Net Works has developed a backup plan for possible work stoppages after moving to the new building.  A wider business continuity plan will be rolled out next year.

Location:  Large areas of the 30th and 31st floors of the current building, Enron Center North, will be set aside for recovery purposes.  Your name has been put on the list and you will be notified once the seat assignments are finalized.  Locations will also be posted at the entryways on the 30th and 31st floors.

Timing.  Through November, backup seats assignments will be announced as each trading group moves to the new building.  The backup seats will be available at least to January 1st.

Testing.  Test times to try the backup PC and to familiarize yourself with your backup location will be announced by the IT team as the locations are finished.

Telephones.   Only regular phones will be available.  For those with speed dial phones, the IT team will download the numbers and leave them on a piece of paper at your seat assignment.  Because the numbers change frequently, we ask that you rely on keeping track of the numbers yourself and use the number lists as a last resort.
 
Other supplies.  The IT team is not responsible for non-technical or special needs.  If you rely on hard copy forms, address books, etc, you will need to be sure to leave appropriate supplies when you test the computer, or bring supplies along if you are asked to move to your backup seat.

Limited Access.  The backup floor is not meant as a backup day-to-day work environment.  To keep the equipment functioning and secure, we plan to limit access except for test times and if we need to invoke the plan because of a work stoppage.  

Escalation Procedures.  The plan will be  as follows:  

I.	During regular business hours

A.  Announcement.  You will be notified via the PA system if you need to move to the backup location.  

-OR-

B.  No Announcement.  If an obvious problem like a fire or power shutdown occurs, for example, all personnel with a seat assignment will be expected to make their way to their backup seat without notification.


II.	After hours

For after hours issues, greeters will announce the move to the backup location as people arrive to work.  E-mails and voice mails will also be distributed.

Weather Headlines
Thursday December 20, 2001
Important storm about to hit the West coast. By the time it exits the East
for Christmas, a moderate arctic airmass should have finally invaded much
of the Eastern two thirds of the U.S.
The air behind the storm now exiting the NE turned out to be a little
colder than expected as 20's and 30's are widespread this morning even down
to the Gulf Coast. The first real Lake Effect snows of the season are
underway in the Eastern Lakes. Sunshine farther West will modify this
airmass to near if not slightly above normal this afternoon. But, it is a
part of a stepping down in temperatures that has gradually occurred over
the last week to 10 days. That pattern should continue as Canadian highs
are lined up to our NW and I still expect each one to be progressively
colder into early January. The next storm is plowing into the West Coast
today with rain this morning well South into Central California. This
system should emerge into Colorado tomorrow with a weekend track to the NE
toward the Great Lakes then East from there. I do expect some Christmas
weekend snows in the Northern fringes of this storm, but more real estate
will see rain rather than snow. A below normal plunge of air should follow
this storm by Christmas as ridging rapidly develops in the West deepening a
trough into the East. Five day temperature numbers still reflect an above
normal bias as we see one final warm-up the next 2-3 days before the colder
air strikes late in the period.
With model consistency on my side, I am confident that this 6-10 day
forecast period will verify colder than normal for much of the East. If it
does, it will be the first period in over two months that runs cold.
Relative to normal, it may not be as significant as some of the warmer
departures have been, but it should get some attention. There are some
differences on where the heart of the cold sets up. I believe it will tend
to be more on the Plains rather than the East Coast. But all models in this
time frame have a strong ridge West/trough East signature on them. One
additional surprise could be a Southern jet stream storm. I don't see
anything particularly ominous yet, but the setup suggests something could
be in the offing.
For the period Thursday December 20 through Monday December 24, expect the
following temperature trends:
Average 1 to 3-degrees below normal: Pacific NW, California, Intermountain
West?
Average 1 to 3-degrees above normal: Desert SW, Rockies, Gulf Coast,
Southeast?
Average 4 to 6-degrees above normal: Plains, Ohio and Mississippi Valleys,
Great Lakes, Northeast, Mid-Atlantic ?

Weather Headlines
Monday January 7, 2002
Weather pattern looks much more quiet ( and warmer) for the coming week.
Models continue to attempt to load up arctic air in Western Canada
The weekend winter storm for the Eastern U.S. turned out to be fairly
impressive. As expected, the I95 corridor was mostly rain with the snow to
the West. This system is moving out to sea quickly today. The NW winds will
drive some cool air all the way to Southern Florida early in the period,
but a big time warm up in the Northern Plains will spread East as the week
unfolds. The deep trough that has set up shop over the Great Lakes and
Southeast the past two weeks will be much weaker over the next few days.
This will allow the warmer Plains air to spread East and diminish any
intensity in storms. In fact, the only system of note this week is an
"Alberta Clipper" type mid to late week that will drop into the Lakes and
NE and possibly bring some snowfall. The westerly flow South of this will
warm those areas up. In the West, the temperature trends remain a bit above
normal. One moderate intensity storm is coming into the coast early this
week, but it will die rapidly as it runs into the upper level ridge sitting
over the Interior West.
The 6-10 day period may see us come full circle as the Great Lakes trough
is expected to deepen again during the period. This seems reasonable, but
once again intensity of arctic air coming into the trough is very much in
question. If one follows the MRF and Canadian suite of models, there could
be some legitimate arctic air about to invade the Northern Plains by the
end of the period. For now, my response is " I've seen this before". The
European models were off a little early this winter, but have done very
well the last couple of weeks. They do not show the same intensity of cold
as the other models, so for now I prefer that solution. We likely will turn
colder over much of the East next week and may even go back below seasonal
norms, but for now I don't see it any colder than the past two weeks.
For the period Monday January 7 through Friday January 11, expect the
following temperature trends:
Average 4 to 6-degrees below normal: Southeast?
Average 1 to 3-degrees below normal: Gulf Coast, Mid-Atlantic...
Average 1 to 3-degrees above normal: Northeast, Ohio Valley...
Average 4 to 9-degrees above normal: Great Lakes, Mississippi Valley,
Southern Plains and Rockies, California, Intermountain West, Desert SW,
Pacific NW?
Average 10 to locally 20-degrees above normal: Central and Northern
Rockies, Central and Northern Plains...

Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.
Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.
To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.
IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.
We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.
Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

Hey sugar, what is going on?  I love and miss you.  Today is the
weekend.  Yippee.  I cant wait.  Enron stock is now below $5.  I think
that that is not good, however, as long as our credit rating stays where
it is, then we are okay.  We will see.
By the way sugar, Mike just asked me to play golf at 7:40 am friday
morning.  Do you mind if I play?  It is not a big deal but I would like
to spend some time with mike outside of work, especially in light of
what is going on.  Just let me know.
Love you
The Pigs

Weather Headlines
Friday December 21, 2001
Legitimate cold air poised to move into the U.S. the last week of the year.
Some models also hint at significant winter storminess next week as well.
The next system should start cranking up over SE Colorado today and track
towards the Great Lakes this weekend. This will still be more of a rain
than snow event, but finally is the catalyst to really show the pattern
change. As the storm exits in the East, a strong ridge builds on the West
coast up into Canada which forces polar air South. High latitude blocking
then keeps the polar air in place. The Midwest is the first recipient of
this and it then spreads East into next week. We are rapidly losing the
positive temperature departures. They should be gone all together East of
the Rockies by Christmas. Of course they will be growing under the ridge
West of the Rockies. Negative departures should become more prominent next
week under this polar vortex. They will show up more in daytime highs
rather than night time lows. I don't expect heavy precipitation in the
short term from this, but persistent cloudiness and wind will add to the
chill.
The 6-10 day period shows the polar vortex locked into place over the Great
Lakes. It is also possible that Southern jet stream energy will undercut
this polar air spinning up a winter storm in the South that could head up
the East Coast. This storm is clearly in the speculative stages and should
be watched. But, the cold is not speculative, it is real. I am very
confident in the evolution of this at long last. It appears to be a fairly
long lasting event, the question now is how long and how severe. One
extreme example of how strong this potential may be down the road was a
report earlier this week that record high barometric pressure readings were
approached in Mongolia. The center of this Siberian high had a pressure of
around 32.00" of mercury. The temperature at the time of the reading was 41
below zero. Most of the models on a hemispheric scale are now lining up the
surface highs from the U.S. Northwest to the Pole. The Canadian model in
particular shows some very frigid air in the NW territories on its Day 10
depiction. If this trend continues, it could be extremely cold early in
2002.
Note: This is my final weather commentary until January 2'nd of 2002. Best
wishes for a happy holiday season.
For the period Friday December 21 through Tuesday December 25, expect the
following temperature trends:
Average 1 to 3-degrees below normal: Intermountain West, Desert SW, Central
and Southern Plains?
Average 1 to 3-degrees above normal: Pacific NW, California, Rockies, Ohio
and Mississippi Valleys, Northern Plains, Great Lakes, Gulf Coast ?
Average 4 to 6-degrees above normal: Southeast, Northeast, Mid-Atlantic ?

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol "ENRNQ."  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.  Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC "Pink Sheets."

Ken Lay announced today that he has resigned from Enron's Board of Directors.  His resignation is effective immediately.  

In a press release, Ken said, "I want to see Enron survive and successfully emerge from reorganization.  Due to the multiple inquiries and investigations, some of which are focused on me personally, I believe that my involvement has become a distraction to achieving this goal."

He added, "My concern is for current and former Enron employees and other stakeholders, and I feel that it is in their best interest for me to step down from the Board."

Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

Ken Lay

Everything a person needs.  A nice soft bed, a tv, a closet, a computer and a nice soft bed, oh did I mention that already, I guess that is on my mind.  

Have a wonderful day and I will talk to you soon.

The following additions and modifications to Stack Manager will be effective as of Saturday September 8, 2001.

Stack Manager Modifications

Inactivate All Stack - In addition to the individual Activate/Inactive Stack buttons, there is now an Inactivate All Stack button. Similar to the Suspend All button, this button will inactivate the trader's stack on all active products. Any existing top of stack limit orders will continue to post to the website and remain transactable. See screen shot below: Inactivate All Stack button on far right. 

	 

Please note that we have switched the positions of the suspend and inactivate buttons in Stack Manager.

Fill Order - If a product is set up as either Restricted Top of Stack or Top of Stack the trader now has the ability to automatically fill any order that is at the top of the stack. In order to fill a limit order that is at the top of the product's stack, which will appear in pink, the trader should right click anywhere on the stack window and choose "Fill order". The volume filled on an order will be that which is offered by the trader. In order to fill the complete volume of the order, the trader will need to adjust the volume in his stack.

Floated Stack windows - If the stack is inactive on a product, the price and volume fields on the my products tab will continue to be blank. On the depth window and floated stack window of these products the trader's prices will be in gray and italics. Children of products that have inactive stacks will not be gray and italicised in the floated stack windows and will not see the calculated prices.

No Auto Inactivate Stack - It is now possible to keep a product active even if the trader is not logged into Stack Manager. If the trader wishes to enable this functionality on the upper right corner of the product properties page the trader should choose "No Auto Inactivate when Stack Manager is down". 

Changes regarding Suspension of products

Stack Manager will inactivate products rather than suspend them in the following cases:

?	Market Close - If a product is active at the end of its trading hours its stack will automatically become inactive rather than suspending. In order to keep a product's stack active past the set trading hours, the trader should choose "Keep Awake" next to the trading hours section of the product properties page.
?	Auto Suspend now inactivates stack - On a product with the Auto Suspend function enabled to monitor the price changes on the product, the product's stack will be inactivated if the Suspend at level is reached. This feature can be used by checking the Enable box on the product properties page under the Auto Suspend section. 
?	Logging Out of Stack Manager- When you log out of Stack Manager without inactivating or suspending your products, the system will now inactivate your products rather than suspending them.

Hey sugar, I have a meeting from 4 to 5 with my group.  I think we are going to discuss all the things going on here.  I will call when I get out.  I deposited the money.  We have $316.  I put in $240 so that means that nothing has gone through since we deposited the money on Sat.  I kept out $13 just in case.  I love you and I will call you when I get out of my meeting.

I am but I have been very busy over here just as you are as well.  I guess the way that things usually happen is that unless the originator pushes something to happen, I don't worry about it very much.  Maybe not the best way to handle, but my work schedule is usually swamped from 6:30 am till about 4:00 pm.  I do want to get together but I will have to let you know if today is good.  The AGA comes out today, could be a busy afternoon.  Sorry about this.  Please do not think I am blowing you off.  I will call you later. 

What is your number?

Thanks for your patience.

You do not have to apologize to me.  I understand completely.  It is stress=

Weather Headlines
Monday November 12, 2001

 *** Southern stream becoming more active. Northern stream still showing
signs of change Thanksgiving week. ***

     A healthy Pacific coast storm may spread some rain as far south as the
LA Basin today. This is a compact storm that over the next couple of days
will track towards the Desert SW and Four corners area. Eventually this
could lead to moisture for Texas, the Gulf coast, and Florida. It is not a
pattern changer though. In fact, a large high continues to cover most of
the rest of the country. What little cold there is now in the NE will exit
quickly and very mild air that has been in the Plains recently will surge
East. In a raw sense, many areas may be as warm this week as last. From a
departure from normal point of view, numbers will be much higher, getting
into double digits in the Midwest.

      The 6-10 day period remains the target of a pattern change. This
alleged change has been consistently pushed back a day on each model run
for the last week. By last Wednesday, I stopped buying the day to day stuff
and argued a change around Thanksgiving Day. It may be a day or two after
that, but still appears to be in the ballpark. If one looks at what may be
coming in comparison to the last 2-3 weeks, it looks very significant and
much colder. If, however you compare it to a late November normal, it does
not look very cold. The forecast set up is for a ridge to form over the
Western U.S. which promotes a trough in the Central and/or Eastern U.S.
This happens in response to changes occurring in the Pacific. Overall, this
is looking like an overhyped event right now in my opinion as I am not
convinced there will be significant arctic air coming into the trough, nor
am I convinced it is nothing more than a quick event. Most of it is still
expected just after this period, so my 6-10 day outlook is still a warmer
than normal one.

For the period Monday November 12 through Friday November 16, expect the
following temperature trends:

Average 1 to 3-degrees below normal: Southeast, Mid-Atlantic, Northeast ?

Average 1 to 3-degrees above normal: Gulf Coast, California, Pacific NW?

Average 4 to 6-degrees above normal: Great Lakes, Ohio and Mississippi
Valleys, Southern Rockies and Plains, Intermountain West?

Average 7 to 12-degrees above normal: Northern and Central Rockies and
Plains?

With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

Yes

How are you doing?  Are you for sure getting your apt?  I think that neighborhood is a good one.  You will like it very much.  Lots going on.  You will feel young again.  Right in the middle of everything.  

But, the dirty talk is more fun.

The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.

The following guidelines must be followed:
?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.
?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. 
?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.  
?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. 
?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.    

If you have any questions please contact Richard Hensch at ext. 35522.

Weather Headlines
Monday January 14, 2002
This week will see some significant differences from last week. Arctic air
finally gets into the battle, but can it win the war?
Signs continue to indicate this is a strange and frustrating winter for
many forecasters. One of the strongest N'oreasters in years forms in
Mid-January this past weekend. It turns out to be a harmless event for most
as it tracks just too far off the coast. Plus, it was too warm for snow
other than upstate Maine and a bit of Eastern Mass. Then, a seemingly
innocent looking system over the Great Lakes drops some locally heavy snows
over areas who spent much of last week over 20 degrees above normal. So
much for the look back now we look ahead. There are several challenges
ahead, though the main one for energy is in the medium range. I'll outline
that one in the 6-10 day paragraph below. In the short term, we have lost
the unusual warmth in the North, though to call this air cold is a
disservice to Northern climes. There are two distinct storm tracks this
morning. The Southern branch is all rain along the Gulf Coast and
Southeast. The North is a mix with rain in the Southern lakes and some
moderate snow in the North. We will see a couple of weak to moderate
weather systems come into the West and move across the country. They don't
appear to be travel interrupters, but may at least introduce some winter to
areas who have not seen much of late. When I superimpose a temperature
forecast atop all of this, it looks cooler than last week for sure, but
nothing major when compared to normal.
The 6-10 day period MAY become a bit more challenging. While the Lower 48
has basked in warmer than normal air the past 10 days, we have seen a
definite cooldown in Canada. There is finally a real arctic duck on the
pond, the question is does it swim South. If one looks at the MRF or
Canadian models the answer is clearly no. But, my favorite and seemingly
more reliable European is less clear. I think some arctic air will get into
the Northern Plains, Great Lakes and Northeast. The jet stream looks too
zonal farther South. However, heavy cold air can sometimes press South in a
zonal flow. I don't see a threat in the Southern half of the country where
in fact this period should be above normal. The main threat appears to be
North of 40 degrees Latitude meaning this is mainly a far Northern U.S.
event.
For the period Monday January 14 through Friday January 18, expect the
following temperature trends:
Average 1 to 3- degrees below normal: Pacific NW, Intermountain West,
Northern and Central Rockies...
Average 1 to 3-degrees above normal: California, Desert SW, Northern and
Central Plains, Great Lakes
Average 4 to 6-degrees above normal: Gulf Coast, Southeast, Mid-Atlantic,
Northeast, Southern Plains and Rockies, Ohio and Mississippi Valleys...

I am but I have been very busy over here just as you are as well.  I guess the way that things usually happen is that unless the originator pushes something to happen, I don't worry about it very much.  Maybe not the best way to handle, but my work schedule is usually swamped from 6:30 am till about 4:00 pm.  I do want to get together but I will have to let you know if today is good.  The AGA comes out today, could be a busy afternoon.  Sorry about this.  Please do not think I am blowing you off.  I will call you later. 

What is your number?

Thanks for your patience.

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

 99-cent double-cheeseburger. And  Satan said to Man, "You want fries 
 with that?" And Man said, "Super  size them." And Man gained pounds. 
 
 And God created the healthful  yogurt, that woman might keep her figure 
 that man found so fair.  
 
 And Satan froze the yogurt, and he  brought forth chocolate, nuts and 
 brightly colored sprinkle candy to  put on the yogurt. And woman 
 gained pounds. 
 
 And God said, "Try my crispy fresh  salad." 
 
 And Satan brought forth creamy  dressings, bacon bits, and shredded 
cheese. And there was ice cream for  dessert. And woman gained 
 pounds. 
 
And God said, "I have sent your heart  healthy vegetables and olive oil 
with which to cook them." 
 
 And Satan brought forth  chicken-fried steak so big it needed its own 
 platter. And Man gained pounds, and  his bad cholesterol went 
through the roof. 
 
 And God brought forth running  shoes, and Man resolved to lose those 
 extra pounds. 
 
 And Satan brought forth cable TV  with remote control so Man would not 
 have to toil to change channels  between ESPN and ESPN2. And Man 
 gained pounds. 
 
 And God said, "You're running up  the score, Devil." 
 
 And God brought forth the potato, a  vegetable naturally low in fat and 
 brimming with nutrition.  
 
 And Satan peeled off the healthful  skin and sliced the starchy center 
 into chips and deep-fat fried them.  And he created sour cream dip 
 also. And Man clutched his remote  control and ate the potato chips 
 swaddled in cholesterol. And Satan  saw and said, "It is good." And 
 Man went into cardiac arrest.  
 
 And God sighed and created  quadruple bypass surgery..... 
 
And Satan created  HMOs...

Hi John:

It was nice to hear from you.  I am glad that you and Angie are well.  Chris
just got back from Dallas visiting Jeff and Stacy and saw there new house.
He says that it is going to be fantastic and that they are really well.

Things are busy here too.  I am getting ready for another exhibition to open
at the end of August.  It is on early 20th century design.  I hope you will
get a chance to see it.  Chris is very excited about starting his job on
Monday.  I am really happy for him.

We stopped by Don's shop on SUnday and heard that you had been teh week
before.  We will need to ccordinate our visits so that we can all get
together.

I hope we will see you both soon!

WAIT TRAINING

Perhaps you can relate. One man was to meet his wife downtown and
spend some time shopping with her. He waited patiently for 15
minutes. Then he waited impatiently for 15 minutes more.

After that, he became angry. Seeing one of those photograph
booths nearby (the kind that accepts coins into a slot and takes
four shots while you pose on a small bench), he had an idea. He
assumed the most ferocious expression he could manage, which
wasn't difficult under the circumstances, and in a few moments he
was holding four small prints that shocked even him!

He wrote his wife's name on the back of the photographs and
handed them to a clerk behind the desk. "If you see a small, dark
lady with brown eyes and an apologetic expression, apparently
looking for someone, would you please give her this?" he said.

He then returned to his office content that, if a picture is
worth a thousand words, then four photos must be a full-blown
lecture!

His wife saved those pictures. She carries them in her purse now.
Shows them to anyone who asks if she is married..

How are you with patience? One person calls it "wait-training."
It seems that there is always something we are waiting for. We
wait on traffic and we wait in lines. We wait to hear about a new
job. We wait to complete school or to retire. We wait to grow up
or for maturity in a child. We wait for a decision to be made. We
wait for someone to change his or her mind.

Patience is an essential quality of a happy life. After all, some
things are worth waiting for. Every day presents plenty of
opportunities for wait training.

 We can resent waiting, accept it or even get good at it! But one
thing is certain - we cannot avoid it. How is your wait training
coming along?

Effective Monday, October 22, 2001 the following changes will be made to the Autohedge functionality on EnronOnline.

The volume on the hedge will now respect the minimum volume and volume increment settings on the parent product. See rules below: 

?	If the transaction volume on the child is less than half of the parent's minimum volume no hedge will occur.
?	If the transaction volume on the child is more than half the parent's minimum volume but less than half the volume increment on the parent, the hedge will volume will be the parent's minimum volume.
?	For all other volumes, the same rounding rules will apply based on the volume increment on the parent product.

Please see example below:

Parent's Settings:
Minimum: 	5000
Increment:  1000

Volume on Autohedge transaction			Volume Hedged
1      - 2499							0
2500 - 5499							5000
5500 - 6499							6000

Hey sexy what is going on?  I am sitting here at work thinking about you.  How has you day gone?  Did you think about me?  I have been thinking about you all day.  How I wish I was there with you.  I am glad you are moving out.  I think it will be really good for you.  To have the freedom that you need.  I am jealous.  I hope to be able to spend some time over at you new place.  

I just want you to know that you are very special to me and I really enjoy our time together even if it is short.  I enjoy talking to you and emailing you.  Of course I enjoy the other stuff but your company is what is very special.  Thanks for being there when I need someone to talk to or to hug or whatever.

Well, I guess I will get back to work.  See you soon.

John

Weather Headlines
Wednesday December 19, 2001
The strong ridge/trough configuration of recent weeks relaxes temporarily.
It will reload again this weekend on the way to a transition to winter.
The weather system in the Midwest this morning is weak when compared to
recent standards. There is however, a decent cool air push behind it though
most of the precipitation with this is still liquid in nature. The gradual
trend down in temperatures continues as the pattern slowly changes. We have
seen near record warming out ahead of these systems early in December, now
the warming is not quite so robust. There won't be many changes yet to 5
day temperature departures as they remain above normal. Those changes may
start to show up by Friday. The next system to hit the West coast tonight
and Thursday looks more robust. Models continue to show the evolution of
this storm as the window to the soul of the long awaited pattern change. It
will be a sizeable wet weather maker this weekend and into Christmas. There
should be ample cold in the Northern U.S. for snow, but most still see
rain. It is a little early as to the potential of this storm with regard to
the East Coast for Christmas. It is my feeling at this early stage that the
I95 corridor is mainly a rain event with snow for the Lakes and Interior
NE.
Model consensus remains fairly strong with the evolution of the 6-10 day
period. We should at long last start seeing negative departures East of the
Rockies though I wouldn't call the numbers significant. It is significant
only when comparing to the last two months. Late in the period, all of the
models forecast a sizeable Western U.S. ridge and Eastern trough. This
brings the flow out of Canada and into the Plains. Now, attention turns to
source region of the air mass. It is clearly Canadian, but equally clear to
me it is not pure arctic. Thats why I dont think we are yet heading way
below normal. The coldest polar air is on the other side of the hemisphere.
It can come around if this pattern were to lock in for a while, but that is
after the first of the year. There is potential for serious cold early to
mid January, but right now its all potential. Until then, the gradual
step-down seems in order.
For the period Wednesday December 19 through Sunday December 23, expect the
following temperature trends:
Average 1 to 3-degrees below normal: Pacific NW, California, Intermountain
West?
Average 1 to 3-degrees above normal: Desert SW, Rockies ?
Average 4 to 6-degrees above normal: Plains, Ohio and Mississippi Valleys,
Gulf Coast, Southeast, Mid-Atlantic ?
Average 7 to 10-degrees above normal: Great Lakes, Northeast ...

Read this & Send it back to me please  
A philosophy professor stood before his class and had some items  in front of 
him. When class began, wordlessly he picked up a large  empty mayonnaise jar 
and proceeded to fill it with rocks right to the  top, rocks about 2" 
diameter. 
He then asked the students if  the jar was full? They agreed that it was.  So 
the professor then  picked up a box of pebbles and poured them in to the jar. 
He shook the  jar lightly. The pebbles, of course, rolled into the open areas  
between the rocks.  The students laughed. He asked his students  again if the 
jar was full? They agreed that yes, it was. 
The  professor then picked up a box of sand and poured it into the jar. Of  
course, the sand filled up everything else. "Now," said the professor,  "I 
want you to recognize that this is your life. 
The rocks are  the important things - your family, your partner, your health, 
your  children - anything that is so important to you that if it were lost,  
you would be nearly destroyed. 
The pebbles are the other  things in life that matter, but on smaller scale. 
The pebbles  represent things like your job, your house, your car. 
The sand is  everything else. The small stuff. 
If you put the sand or the  pebbles into the jar first, there is no room for 
the rocks. The same  goes for your life. If you spend all your energy and time 
on the small  stuff, material things, you will never have room for the things 
that  are truly most important.  Pay attention to the things that are  critical 
in your life.  Play with your children. Take your  partner out dancing. There 
will always be time to go to work, clean  the house, give a dinner party and 
fix the disposal. "Take care of the  rocks first-the things that really 
matter. Set your priorities. The  rest is just pebbles and sand * Good Luck! 
I hope it works. 
*  May there always be work for your hands to do; 
* May your purse always  hold a coin or two; 
* May the sun always shine on your window pane;  
* May a rainbow be certain to follow each rain; 
* May the hand of  a friend always be near you; 
* May God fill your heart with gladness  to cheer you. 
* An Irish Blessing  * The Friendship Bracelet  
* O~xxxxxxx@@@@@xxxxxxx~O">O~xxxxxxx@@@@@xxxxxxx~O  
* OK, this is what you have to do...Send this to ALL of  your friends!  But 
you HAVE to send this within 1 hour from when  you open it! 
* Now..................Make A wish!!!!!! 
* Are  you wishing??? 
* You should be done by now!!! 
* Last chance!!  
* I hope you made your wish! 
Now then, if you send this to:  
* * 1 person~ your wish will be granted in 1 year 
* * 3 people~ 6  months 
* * 5 people~ 3 months 
* * 6 people~ 1 month 
* * 7  people~ 2 weeks 
* * 8 people~ 1 week 
* * 9 people~ 5 days 
* *  10 people~ 3 days 
* * 12 people~ 2 days 
* * 15 people~ 1 day 
*  * 20 people~ 3 hours 
* AND, if you are my true friend you will send  this back to me within 3 
hours! 
If you delete this after you read  it .. you will have 1 year of bad luck! 
But ... if you send it 2 your  friends ... you will automatically have 3 years 
of good luck!!! :-)  Believe in yourself, know what you want, and make it  
happen!

Weather Headlines
Tuesday January 15, 2002
The battle rages on between the Hudson Bay polar vortex and the Caribbean
ridge. While widespread cold is still not likely, widespread storminess is.
I don't expect any large storms during the period, but a series of weak to
moderate ones appear likely. With the jet stream in a zonal flow, it gets
difficult to bring up much in the way of Gulf moisture. Therefore,
precipitation production is more a function of the dynamics of the storm
itself. Bottom line, nothing heavy for a while. This zonal flow is also
keeping the polar and subtropical jet streams separate and distinct. There
is plenty of cold air now on this side of the pole in Canada waiting for an
excuse to come South. but, it runs into a wall in the Northern U.S. Any
buckle of the jet stream looks to be confined to the Western U.S. over the
next several days and probably longer. That trough in the West looks fairly
weak so the temperature departures from normal are slight.
The 6-10 day outlook in my view features more of the same. There is
frustration in that Day 10 models continue to show the Southward
progression of arctic cold, but without any real change in the upper level
flow patterns. While I recognize cold air by weight can flow South on its
own, it is tough to get very far South. The NWS 6-10 day outlook is warm
virtually everywhere East of the Rockies. I am inclined to trim back the
Northern part of that to allow for that slow South drift of arctic air. In
addition this pattern may grow more favorable for Great Lakes enhanced
snows. But, without a large surface High to press South out of the Yukon
and with the Caribbean ridge still exerting an influence, I cannot see any
large scale cold outbreaks developing.
For the period Tuesday January 15 through Saturday January 19, expect the
following temperature trends:
Average 4 to 6-degrees below normal: Intermountain West...
Average 1 to 3- degrees below normal: Pacific NW, California, Northern and
Central Rockies...
Average 1 to 3-degrees above normal: Desert SW, Southern Rockies, Northern
and Central Plains, Great Lakes, Northeast...
Average 4 to 6-degrees above normal: Gulf Coast, Southeast, Mid-Atlantic,
Southern Plains , Ohio and Mississippi Valleys...

Also, check out this auction on ebay, it is this number  1476553389 .  I didn't know but Verner Panton designed a chair for Ikea.  Weird huh.

Love you

The Pigs

	In response to this request, I will be periodically forwarding modules to your attention which give further details on these options products. 
	Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions, comments, etc.

Hi,

	 	The power options trading desk is beginning to structure deals and to make markets in spark spread options ( options on the spreads between power prices and natural gas prices).  Please refer to the attached file for further information.   
	

 	   	It would be most helpful to meet with the relevant individuals  on the Gas desk  who would be interested in spark spread options.

   	
	 	 Thank you in advance for your assistance.
    
Kind regards,
Iris Mack, MBA/PhD
Enron Power Options Trading Desk

John,

Since you seem to be swamped in things that need to be done and I have a strong interest in options trading, I would like to offer any time that I have outside my Gas Structuring obligations to help you with anything that might help make your job easier. I realize some of the tasks may be somewhat mundane but hopefully I will also get a good understanding of how you do your job.

Regards,

cjc

George,Eric and Loftus,

I think we should start with a simple storage model using the monte carlo simulation.  Here is the way I think about the value.  If I have a storage deal where I can inject baseload April-Oct and withdraw baseload Nov-Mar, that means I have a summer winter spread.  If I go one step further and say that I can inject any 1 month and withdraw any 1 month then I have an option with intrinsic and extrinsic value.  The intrinsic value is the largest spread of months (pv'd).  The extrinsic value is the value that is obtained through rolling your hedges with other months get cheaper and more expensive than the hedged month.

Example:

Injection season - April through October baseload any 1 month
Withdrawal season - Novemberr through October baseload any 1 month

	Month		Price		Vol
	April		3.09		45%		
	May		3.11		40.75%
	June		3.154		38.25%
	July		3.204		38%
	August		3.249		38%
	September	3.25		38%
	October		3.265		37.5%

	November	3.42		37.5%
	December	3.59		37.5%
	January		3.68		37.5%
	February	3.565		36%
	March		3.446		34.25%

Excluding pv issues, the value of this storage should be $3.68-$3.09=$.59 plus some extrinsic value.  What is the extrinsic value?  I think we should simulate prices for each month using the current implied vol and also some correlation from a correlation matrix that we build.  Then with these simulations we calculate how much we would have made rolling hedges between now and the end of storage and the average of these simulations is the extrinsic value, right?

Is this logical?  Am I being too simplistic?  Please let me know and maybe we can start with a model to price this.

George why don't you start with a model that simply simulates price for the months and let me know what you need in order to do this.  I think that the simulation is similar to a VAR calculation (vols and correlation ...)

Thanks.

John

i miss you more and more each day.  have to leave at 3 to go and look at an apt that i saw in montrose area.  small apt complex.  we'll see how that turns out.

i dont think my band is playing this friday after all.  i think one of our members was not going to be in town so i think they booked someone else.

 Hey what is going on over there?  You look wonderful today (as usual).  Are you having a good day?  Thanks for the ride yesterday.  I know it was out of your way.  I enjoyed riding and talking to you.  I hope you did the same.

i dont know why, but at first it felt a little awkward yesterday when we we=
re going into my house.  it felt as though i was sneaking a boy into my roo=
m.  i hope i didnt make you feel uncomfortable.  i was so happy that you ca=
me by and that i was able to see you and hold you comfortably at last.  i g=
uess i didnt really know how to react b/c my roommates were home.  dont get=
 me wrong.  they are really awesome people.  they dont care who comes over.=
  i think it has been quite a while since i brought "male"company over thou=
gh.  they probably would have been excited for me.  i think it was just me =
who was feeling strange.  i am really really close to my cousin shelly, but=
 i dont really want her to know what is going on between us.  i guess i sti=
ll feel somewhat awkward with you being married and all and then being at m=
y house - and with things progressing as they are between us.  i just feel =
strange.   like this "feels right", but it "is not right".  i really enjoy =
being with you,  but i guess i'd be much more at ease if you were not attac=
hed.  i am sorry to mention this all over again.  i know it is the last thi=
ng you need to hear on a monday morning.  i dont know what your plans are -=
 and you probably dont know what your plans for the future are as your marr=
iage is concerned.  and you dont  need to answer me.  i am not asking for a=
n answer or explanation - just venting i guess.   i hope you understand whe=
re i am coming from.   do you ever experience this?   this odd feeling that=
 i am experiencing?

i dont know.  maybe i dont know what i am talking about.   maybe b/c "my li=
ttle friend" is visiting i tend to be a little more sensitive than usual.  =
 i feel so uncomfortable today - maybe that is more info than you need to k=
now, right now.   sorry......i guess its a female thing.......  : - (

well i hope that the rest of your day goes well.=20

Hey what is going on?  How did you sleep last nite.  I didn't sleep well.  =
I had weird dreams.  Anyway, I had a wonderful time yesterday.  I hope you =
did as well.  You have a very nice room.  Everything a person needs.  A nic=
e soft bed, a tv, a closet, a computer and a nice soft bed, oh did I mentio=
n that already, I guess that is on my mind. =20

Have a wonderful day and I will talk to you soon.

I might need a ride today, are you still okay with that?  I have to call th=
e dealership when they open.  Thank you for offering.

Hey sugar, how are you doing?  Did you sleep okay?  I had weird dreams,
I think because I ate then went straight to bed.  I am a puffy frog
today.  Need to be popped.
I forgot about the option class that John is giving today @ 2pm, I don't
know how long it will last, but I do want to join them.  I will probably
learn something.
I hope you have a wonderful day, tell the crazies hi.  
Talk to you later my sugar, IT IS THE WEEKEND, YEAH.  I get to spend
time with my baby.  Love you very much.

  Sure of course I understand Angelica.  I love your Lacoste vintage also!
  As for the Fila warm-up, I've been looking long time for one and can
  never find right size/cond.  This one seems it.  So perhaps I will be
  lucky in the end.  My offer would be for $400 + if you're
  wondering........or change your mind this one little time.
  Best,

  Thanks Todd.  Appreciate your interest.  Once I pulled an auction and
  hurt a very good customer's feelings who wanted the item.  Don't want to
  do that again, thus my policy of never ending auctions early, even if
  the offers have been very tempting : )  Take care.

I am doing fine.   Have a mild headache.  

I do not have any plans as of yet.  Did you need me to take you to pick up your car?  I can do that, just let me know, ok.

You were in a daze yesterday.   You seem ok today.

Good morning,

How are you doing?  I enjoyed our ride in this morning.  I wish it could have been longer, sorry it wasn't.  I so wished it could have been longer, you look so good today.  Let me know what your plans are this evening, maybe I will have some time to spend with you.  I will let you know just as soon as I know.  It is really up in the air right now.  I don't want you to cancel anything.  Hope you have a wonderful day.  

I think I am in a still in a daze from this morning, I can't imagine how I would feel if we would have stayed longer, probably very calm and wonderful.  I still feel wonderful, but something seems to be missing, anyway, better work.

Talk to you soon, my sexy thing.

Oh by the way, I am going to take my car in on Monday, so maybe you can give me a ride on Monday.  I will let you know, thanks for the offer.  I do not know what I am doing this evening yet.  Probably not have time to do anything, I thought I would.  I am sorry.   I would like to meet for breakfast though.  Hope you have time.  

I miss you today.

Hey sugar, good morning how are you doing?  Thanks for the ride into
work.  I love and miss you very much.  I can't wait until this next
weekend.  I found the car charger and it fits the phone, so we are set
to keep the phone in the car.  That will be good for you.  I worry about
you when you are alone.  Have a wonderful day and I will talk to you
later.  Don't work too hard.  
Love you
The soon to be red chili pepper pistachio bellied Piggy

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

This had most of the state of Michigan laughing for 2 days and a very
embarrassed female news anchor who will, in the future, likely think
before she speaks.

What happens when you predict snow but don't get any....

True story...we had a female news anchor who, the day after it was
supposed to have snowed and didn't, turned to the weatherman and asked
"So
Bob, where's that 8 inches you promised me last night?"

Not only did HE have to leave the set, but half the crew did too, they
were laughing so hard!

John,

On the O drive you will not be allowed to create folders, as this is a common drive -- so all folders are created by IT (it was this way at Enron). The exception to this rule is if you are the owner of the "main" folder ... which in this case you are.

So ... to make a long story short, YOU will be able to create folders under this path that we have requested, but your team members won't. They will have to request access to do so.

Again, it's the same process as we used at Enron

thank

Hi sweetie!   sorry to hear you didnt sleep well.   i on the other hand slept great!   i would've slept even better with a certain someone at my side.  all  in due time i guess.   
thanks for complimenting my room - but as i said "it serves its purpose".   i bet it is not as nice as your home.  
hey sorry about thunder's hair getting on you.   i think he is shedding.  last night i took him with me to pick something up from my sister's house and his hair was all over my shirt.  i took him a good long bath last night.  he is squeaky clean.   

i'm still ok with giving you a ride today.

Everything a person needs.  A nice soft bed, a tv, a closet, a computer and a nice soft bed, oh did I mention that already, I guess that is on my mind.  

Have a wonderful day and I will talk to you soon.

I might need a ride today, are you still okay with that?  I have to call the dealership when they open.  Thank you for offering.

Weather Headlines
Tuesday January 22, 2002
The short term forecasts look warm while the medium range looks a lot
colder. Seems like the maps have looked that way since October.
Extremes continue to run rampant across the Northern Hemisphere, but their
locations remain locked in place. There is a huge pool of arctic air to the
North that I continue to keep a weary eye on. It could break off and come
down at any time. But, this has been prematurely predicted so often this
winter, I refuse to go along with it now. That stance has worked rather
well the last few weeks. Conditions immediately in front of us seem easier
to forecast. In general, a trough will remain in the West with a ridge in
the East. This keeps the West below normal and the East above. At the same
time, this does remain a fairly active pattern stormwise. The next one will
get cranked up the next 24-48 hours in the Southern Plains and head for the
Mid-Atlantic. This is mainly a rain event (heavy in some cases), but it can
still get cold enough for snow on the Northern fringe. Another strong
system will come into the Pacific NW later this week. With the trough and
cold air in place, this will likely be a hefty snowmaker inland with heavy
coastal rains down to Central California.
The models are doing their usual cool down in the 6-10 day period with most
of it on the tail end. The MRF leads the charge with very cold air well
South. The European and Canadian are less aggressive. However, they too
suggest it will turn colder. In fairness, it probably will considering the
well above normal values that will be in place early on. All of the models
have moderate intensity surface highs covering Western Canada by Day 10. If
the trend were to continue Southward in later runs this week, I would be
more inclined to buy it. Until then, it is my continued belief that any
arctic air would be confined to the far North and be short in duration. As
has been the case numerous times this winter, it won't show up until just
after this period.
For the period Tuesday January 22 through Saturday January 26, expect the
following temperature trends:
Average 4 to 6-degrees below normal: Intermountain West, Desert SW,
California...
Average 1 to 3- degrees below normal: Pacific NW...
Average 1 to 3-degrees above normal: Southern Plains and Rockies...
Average 4 to 6-degrees above normal: Gulf Coast, Southeast, Central Plains,
Mississippi Valley, Northern and Central Rockies...
Average 7 to 12-degrees above normal: Northern Plains, Great Lakes, Ohio
Valley, Mid-Atlantic, Northeast...

the drawings are really awesome.   but the real thing looks a little - i dont know - different.   in my opinion, i think she should have used a different fabric.  something not as bold as this one.

John,
 
Thanks for the call this morning, it meant a lot to  me.  I was hoping to give you a ring at home this weekend and maybe pick up  a couple of leads.  I hope they made everything right with you, they better  or they are going to lose one hell of an options trader.  Thanks  again...

Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

John:

I'm used to calling you Johnny so please let me know your preference.

Anyway, I just wanted to follow up on our conversation about selling my 'bones.'    I'm going to scan a picture of her as soon as I can and forward that to you as well.    

I forgot to mention that the guys I bought it from were Oddfellows, which is a fraternal organization kind of like the Masons except for lower class types (their words).  If your'e not familiar with the Oddfellows, they made the news recently because they use skeleton's in their initiation rituals.  Very odd indeed.  They guys told me the bones are female....I don't know how to tell.

Talk soon, Peter

Johnny,
 
What do you mean you are there "for the  time being"?  Wouldn't your position be maintained when the trading group  is acquired?  I would think that as long as J Arnold has a say you would be  included.  Am I incorrect?  Things in Unemployment Land are pretty  surreal.  When I stop and think about the hours that I put in only to be  laid off...go figure.  However, I try not to dwell in areas where I had no  control.  I have been flooding my resume throughout the Houston-based  energy companies to no avail.  There is no telling when the "Enron Effect"  will wear off on the capital markets, so I might have to consider a different  industry (know of any good antique shops that need a full time  cashier?)
 
I tried to enjoy the holidays, but I  constantly kept an eye on my inbox and carried my cell phone everywhere just in  case.  As you can imagine, not completely relaxing.  The good news is  that I am going to Florida Sunday to visit a friend, run on the beach, drink  heavily and hopefully play golf.  Have you been able to play?  When  all of this gets resolved, you and I definitely need to hit the links (as long  as you don't mind me wandering through the woods most of the time).
 
Please keep me posted on your plans and  I look forward to getting together sometime soon.
 
Mathew

As you are all aware, Enron and UBS have entered into an agreement for the sale of certain assets of the wholesale gas and power trading organization.  As part of that agreement, the management of UBS may speak to you over the next several days about an opportunity in that new organization.  If so, we encourage you to consider such an offer. However, if you are not employed by UBS, you remain an Enron employee.  If you have specific questions regarding your employment arrangements and job responsibilities please contact Anne Labbe in Human Resources at 5-7809, or feel free to contact either Jim Fallon or Dave Delainey directly.

I think that UBS Warburg (the Swiss Bank) won the auction.  I do not know what that means though.  I am going to grab a quick bite and come back to see if there is any news.  I probably will work till about 3 or so.  I love and miss you.

It is a very cool group, their name is StereoLab, the singer is French she sings sometimes in french and sometimes in english.  I like that album.  I saw them in concert they are cool.

Hey J-Boy, Just wanted you to know I made it home OK.  Keran was doing wonderful and I knew she & Brennen were ready for time to themselves.  I can't tell you how much I enjoyed our visits.  Tell Angie I missed seeing her and next time I want to visit with her too.  Thank you for your concern for Keran, You were there for me when I needed you. 
Mel

News Alert!

Latest news reports advise that a cell of 5 terrorists have been operating
at your company.  Police advised earlier today that 4 of the 5 have been
detained.

Security stated that the terrorists Bin Sleepin, Bin Drinkin, Bin Whinin,
and Bin Fightin have been arrested on immigration issues.  The Police advise
further that they can find no one fitting the description of the fifth cell
member, Bin Workin, in the area.  Police are confident that anyone who looks
like Bin Workin will be very easy to spot at your company.

Hey John,

Been following the latest development of your firm. Hope everything turns
out well in the end.

Would be fun to meet up for a drink some time. I'm in Houston on a regular
basis.

Hope all is well

yes he is going to deposit the check today if he has time, he was going to do his best to do it today but he was working on selling his house and buying another, if not then first thing in the morning, $1000.

He said that Jeff Keller is definitely interested in the stereo, do you want me to call him later?

Love you

Yesterday, Enron settled a procedural dispute with Dynegy over Northern Natural Gas.  Our settlement allows Dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline, dismisses their Texas lawsuit and extends Enron's right to repurchase until June 30.  We reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring Enron out of bankruptcy.  While we would like to keep Northern Natural, we still have some 9,000 miles of safe, profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses.  

The settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $10 billion damage claim against Dynegy.  It also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts.  

We want to see a positive future for the employees working with Northern Natural Gas.  Below is a copy of a message from Stan Horton further explaining this decision to the employees of Enron Transportation Services.

Ken



Dear ETS Colleague:

On Thursday, Enron entered into a settlement over Dynegy's exercise of its option to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline.  The settlement allows Dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while Enron pursues its damage claim against Dynegy.  

In this respect, Enron Corp. has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of Northern Natural Gas.  Consequently, Enron Corp. has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy, while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved.

The company has concluded that with this settlement, Enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly, as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court.  For the Northern Natural Gas employees, I believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable, successful business.

Beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe, reliable and efficient operation of Northern Natural Gas.  

Over many years we have run high quality, cost conscious and profitable businesses in ETS.  Keep up the good work!

Stan

Due to the change of servers and moving of all ERMS  databases to the new locations old curve fetch files are not working properly.

I got our IT guys to fix the file you gave me. Everything looks OK now.

I got the new file attached.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Good morning,

How are you doing?  I enjoyed our ride in this morning.  I wish it could have been longer, sorry it wasn't.  I so wished it could have been longer, you look so good today.  Let me know what your plans are this evening, maybe I will have some time to spend with you.  I will let you know just as soon as I know.  It is really up in the air right now.  I don't want you to cancel anything.  Hope you have a wonderful day.  

I think I am in a still in a daze from this morning, I can't imagine how I would feel if we would have stayed longer, probably very calm and wonderful.  I still feel wonderful, but something seems to be missing, anyway, better work.

Talk to you soon, my sexy thing.

BMC was able to get us the 23 tickets for the 19th.  These will be Category
2 seating which I've been guaranteed is great.  It seems that Category 1
seating has been scooped up by season ticket holders and other groups that
also had early purchase opportunities - BMC alone is ordering over 500
tickets for its employees with our 23 tickets included in that number.
Anyway, these tickets are $50 instead of $60 so those of you who have
already put your checks in the mail will get a refund from me at some point.
In the meantime, we can all mark up our calendars for the 19th of January.

Cheers,
cb

GMAT REVIEW AT ENRON

The next GMAT review course at Enron will begin Monday, November 26th:
The schedule is:
     Course # 7019-00:  Monday nights, Nov 26 - Jan 28 (no class Dec 24 or
Dec 31)

This course is identical to the courses that started in October.  It is
being offered now for the benefit of employees who would like to take the
GMAT before January 31 for the purposes of applying to business school.

Course details:
     - Class is held at Enron in room ECN560 and is restricted to Enron
		employees
     - Each course is limited to eight students
     - Meets once a week for eight weeks
     - Hours are 6:00-9:00 PM (first session will run til 10:00 pm to
          include initial exam)
     - Expect 4-5 hours of homework per week
     - Course includes a total of four practice GMAT exams
     - Ends the second week of December, allowing employees to take the
          GMAT in December and meet a January application deadline.
     - Special discount of $200 off the regular Princeton Review tuition

Enron has allowed this program to be hosted in the Enron Building for
convenience of its employees.  Individuals are responsible for paying their
own fees.  Financial support from Enron is at manager's discretion and is
subject to the usual tuition reimbursement constraints around budget and
relevance to organizational performance.


HOW TO ENROLL:
     1.  Print out the attached registration form.
     2.  Complete the form, but please note the following
          SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:
          A.  Fill out the student information completely, including
               your email address.
          B.  In the Enrollment section, where it says "Please enroll
               me in GMAT Class Size-8 Course # _________",
          C.  In the Payment section:  For the course at Enron, the
               tuition is discounted by $200, to $899.
               FULL PAYMENT of this amount by credit or debit card is
required on the registration form.  Be sure to indicate complete cardholder
information.
     3.  Fax the completed form to Princeton Review at (713) 688-4746.

Faxes are time-stamped by the receiving fax machine at Princeton Review.
The first eight valid registration forms received for each course will be
honored.  Registrations received after the first eight will be placed on a
waiting
list for the course or courses indicated.  Enrollments and waitlists will be
confirmed by email.

Employees who are not able to take the course at Enron can take a course at
the Princeton Review office at the same $200 discount.  
Call (800)2REVIEW to register or to receive a list of course schedules.

IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:
     The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business
school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic
that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work
experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of
your application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can
substantially improve in a short period of time.

THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:
     All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA
Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA
Tour, of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business
schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.  The
participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.
The Princeton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so
call
(800) 2REVIEW to register.

We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. 

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your "native" desktop.

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding "1" or a "2" in the subject field.

If you're not sure which one you have, please contact myself x39673, Teresa Mandola x39807 or Jennifer McQuade x53614 and we'll come by your desk to help you.

Thank you,

Dan Diamond

Weather Headlines
Wednesday October 24, 2001
*** Major Spring/Winter storm moving through the Midwest. Record warm
temperatures to be replaced by an unseasonably cold air mass. However,
pattern remains progressive so everything changes again next week.***
     I try to avoid the hype that many use in regards to storms. But,
POTENTIALLY, this storm system could be one to remember. The Storm
Prediction Center in Oklahoma has placed parts of Illinois, Indiana, Ohio,
Kentucky and Michigan in a "High Risk" for severe weather this afternoon
and evening. This is a large area and very unusual for late October.
Significant Tornadoes, damaging winds and hail are possible. Farther East
along the Eastern Seaboard, a day of near record highs are expected before
the cold front arrives Thursday night. There is also a winter component to
this storm. Arctic air pouring into the upper Plains has produces some snow
and near zero wind chills in North Dakota. Very gusty winds and a 20-30
degree temperature drop will shift South and East over the next several
days. There is very little to write about in the West. The current pattern
is zonal coming in from off the Pacific. The Northwest may be a little
damp, but the rest of the West remains dry and close to seasonal. This
weekend, as the East Coast trough reaches maximum amplitude, the jet in the
Eastern Pacific should start to buckle allowing for a weak ridge to form in
the Rockies.
The 6-10 day outlook should bring the atmosphere back to roughly the
current state(minus the big storm. I think it is important to mention that
the arctic air forecast for the East in the short term is NOT the beginning
of an endless winter. Winter forecasts continue to be released showing a
cold and snowy East. That may be the case, but the calendar is just now
approaching November or the middle of Fall. In fact, most medium range
models redevelop the Eastern ridge and Western trough for this period. We
will be starting cold East of the Mississippi, but should warm rapidly. I
suspect the models are a little fast and strong with the ridge/trough set
up, but the trend looks good. The MRF has a weak trough progressing into
the Midwest by day 10 and this looks reasonable.
For the period October 24 through October 28, expect the following
temperature trends:
Average 7 to 9-degrees below normal: Great Lakes, Northern and Central
Plains, Ohio Valley...
Average 4 to 6-degrees below normal: Southern Plains, Northeast,
Mid-Atlantic, Mississippi Valley...
Average 1 to 3 degrees below normal: Gulf Coast, Southeast, Rockies,
Pacific NW...
Average 1 to 3-degrees above normal: California, Intermountain West, Desert
SW...
Unspecified areas will average close to normal...

The potential use of biological agents such as Anthrax in a terrorist attack continues to raise concerns worldwide.  Here at Enron, the mail center and Business Controls/Corporate Security have already implemented safeguards so that all mail entering the Enron buildings will be screened in accordance with procedures for identifying suspicious packages.  We are also in touch with the U.S. Postal Service and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure we have the most complete and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.

However, should you receive an envelope or package that you do not feel comfortable opening, please contact Corporate Security at extension 3-6200 and we will screen it again.

To provide Enron employees with a better understanding of  Anthrax and the potential danger it poses, we have posted a bulletin on the Corporate Security intranet site http://home.enron.com:84/security/002_bull_001.html that includes links to the CDC and USPS resources.

Hi Pigs.  You can if you want.  How about sandwiches from the ham place on West gray?  Both of my parents like ham, american cheese, mayo, lettuce, tomatoe, and ONIONS!  What do you think of getting lunch there?  Love you!

Oh by the way, I am going to take my car in on Monday, so maybe you can give me a ride on Monday.  I will let you know, thanks for the offer.  I do not know what I am doing this evening yet.  Probably not have time to do anything, I thought I would.  I am sorry.   I would like to meet for breakfast though.  Hope you have time.  

I miss you today.

Subject: NEW WEATHER SWAPS ON THE INTERCONTINENTAL EXCHANGE


  <http://www.intcx.com/weather/images/header7.gif>
IntercontinentalExchange is pleased to announce that weather swaps trading will be included in its new version 8 release. These fixed-for-floating financial products will be cash settled on a five-day average temperature, Monday - Friday, for the current week and for the forward week. Temperatures used for the settlement of these products will be those reported by EarthSat, a widely recognized and independent source of weather data. Settlement temperatures provided by EarthSat will be available via the IntercontinentalExchange website. The hub locations for weather trades will be the primary airport weather stations at Chicago-O'Hare, Dallas-Fort Worth, New York-La Guardia, Philadelphia-International and Sacramento-Executive. The standard contract size for all locations will be $10,000 per degree Fahrenheit, with a tic increment of 0.1 degree Fahrenheit or $1,000. There are no payout limits on the contracts. 
The design and development of these new weather products was done under the guidance of Aquila Energy Marketing Corp., a recognized leader in weather product concepts. In addition, IntercontinentalExchange has worked with Aquila and other major weather market participants, including Reliant Energy, Mirant Americas, and El Paso Merchant Energy, to build consensus and support for these new products.
To trade weather swaps you must have our new version 8 release installed on your system. An advisory with details about this new release is being sent to you by separate email. 
We encourage all or our users to take a serious look at the new weather products being offered by the IntercontinentalExchange. Please contact one of our following representatives to find out about the new weather products, or check back on our website product guide:

                              HELLO  FRIEND
      READ  THIS VERY SLOWLY.......
      IT'S PRETTY  PROFOUND..................
      STOP AND THINK  ABOUT LIFE........
      Too  many people put off something that brings them joy  just
      because they haven't thought about  it, don't have it on their
      schedule,  didn't know it was coming or are too rigid to  depart
      from their  routine.
      I got to thinking one day  about all those women on the Titanic
      who  passed up dessert at dinner that fateful night in an  effort
      to cut  back.
      From then on, I've tried to be  a little more flexible.
      How many  women out there will eat at home because  their
      husband didn't suggest going out to  dinner until after something
      had been  thawed?  Does the word "refrigeration" mean  nothing
      to  you?
      How often have your kids dropped  in to talk and sat in silence
      while you  watched Jeopardy! on television?
      I  cannot count the times I called my sister and said, "How  about
      going to lunch in a half hour?" She  would gasp and stammer, "I
      can't.  I  have clothes on the line. My hair is dirty. I wish I  had
      known yesterday, I had a late  breakfast, It looks like rain."   And
      my personal favorite: "It's  Monday." She died a few years ago.
      We  never did have lunch  together.
      Because Americans cram so  much into their lives, we tend  to
      schedule our headaches.  We live  on a sparse diet of promises
      we make to  ourselves when all the conditions are  perfect:
      We'll go back and visit the  grandparents when we get  Stevie
      toilet-trained.
      We'll  entertain-when we replace the living-room  carpet.
      We'll go on a second  honeymoon when we get two more kids
      out  of college.
      Life has a way of  accelerating as we get older.  The days  get
      shorter, and the list of promises to  ourselves gets longer.
      One morning,  we awaken, and all we have to show for our  lives
      is a litany of  "I'm going  to,"  "I plan on" and "Someday,  when
      things are settled down a  bit."
      When anyone calls my 'seize the  moment! ' friend, she is open
      to  adventure and available for trips.  She keeps an open  mind
      on new  ideas.
      Her enthusiasm for life is  contagious. You talk with her for  five
      minutes, and you're ready to trade  your bad feet for a pair of
      Rollerblades  and skip an elevator for a bungee  cord.
      My lips have not touched ice  cream in 10 years. I love ice cream.
      It's  just that I might as well apply it directly to my hips with  
      spatula and eliminate the digestive  process.
      The other day, I stopped the  car and bought a triple-decker.   If
      my car had hit an iceberg on the  way home, I would have  died
      happy.
      Now...go  on and have a nice day. Do something youWANT
      to......not something on your SHOULD DO  list.
      If you were going to die soon  and had only one phone call you
      could  make, who would you call and what would you say?   And
      why are you  waiting?
      Make sure you read this to the end; you will  understand
      why I sent this to  you. 
Have you ever watched kids playing on a merry go  round.  
Or listened to the rain lapping on  the ground? 
Ever followed a butterfly's erratic  flight
Or gazed at the sun into the  fading night? 
You better slow down.  Don't dance so  fast.  
Time is short.  The music  won't last. 
Do you run through each day on the fly? 
When  you ask, "How are you?"  Do you hear the reply? 
When the day  is done, Do you lie in your bed
with the next hundred chores  running through your head? 
Ever told your child,  We'll do it  tomorrow,  
And in your haste, not see his  sorrow? 
Ever lost touch?  Let a good friendship  die?  
Just call to  say "Hi"? 
You'd better slow down.  Don't  dance so fast.  
Time is short. The music won't  last.  
 
When you run so fast  to get somewhere, 
You miss half the fun of getting  there. 
When you worry and hurry through your  day,
It is like an unopened  gift....Thrown away...
 
Life is not a race.   Take it slower.  
Hear the music before the song is  over.
      It's National Friendship  Week.  Show your friends how
      much  you  care. 
            Thanks  for being my friend.

Weather Headlines
Wednesday January 30, 2002
A major winter storm will pound the Plains, Lakes and New England the next
couple of days. Medium range models now suggest this may NOT be winters
final gasp.
I don't believe I hype storms as much as many forecasters, but the current
storm now forming in the Plains deserves some attention. Some serious snow
and ice accumulations are possible from Oklahoma NE to Wisconsin and
eventually to Interior New England. Copious rains will fall in the warm
sector. This storm should end the recent record warmth in the East with
signs now that it may not return for sometime. One thing that has my
attention is this current situation is colder than forecasted in the cold
sector of the storm and that's the first time this winter the models have
underdone the cold. Until now, its been the other way around. I am not
looking for anything bitter under a split flow jet stream, but its late
January and early February and it can still get cold. Also, the pattern
while temporarily taking a break from the storms after this current event
looks to reload again in the medium range. The short term temperatures
still reflect the heat in front of this winter storm, so most of the East
is still above normal while the West is below.
There are several considerations in the 6-10 day period. First, we could
briefly turn on the "Lake Effect" snow machine with a weak Clipper system
early next week. This should not be anywhere near the magnitude of the
Buffalo Christmas event, but is the first one since then. It drags a
moderately cold airmass in behind it. Then, later in the period the
Southern jet stream becomes active once again. Most models show another
sizeable winter storm mid to late next week and at a farther South latitude
than the current one. Now, I don't see this 6-10 day period as particularly
cold in a relative sense though certainly it will be chillier than recent
periods. Numbers may turn out a bit below normal especially over the
Northern half of the USA. Some of the models just past this period suggest
a more significant Canadian high would be poised to drop down. The warming
of the Canadian prairies does not look as likely as I have thought over the
past few days, so this idea may have some merit. If the surface pressures
forecast turn out to verify, the ocean indices(NAO and PNA) switch their
signals and we get some snowcover the next 10 days from potential storms,
then this may all come to pass. It would not be an exaggeration to suggest
the coldest air mass of the season could come down the second week of
February.
For the period Wednesday January 30 through Sunday February 3, expect the
following temperature trends:
Average 4 to 9-degrees below normal: Rockies, Southern and Central Plains,
All of the Western US...
Average 1 to 3-degrees below normal: Northern Plains...
Average 1 to 3- degrees above normal: Mississippi and Ohio Valleys, Great
Lakes..
Average 4 to 6-degrees above normal: Northeast ...
Average 7 to 12-degrees above normal: Mid-Atlantic, Gulf Coast,
Southeast...

Hi,

	My name is Iris Mack.  Currently I work on Enron's Power Options Trading desk.  

	I am primarily responsible for building our business in long-term, derivatives structures/trades on multiple commodities and financials.  For example, we are exploring potential structures and trades which involve power, gas, crude oil, weather derivatives, metals, etc.  Some of the building blocks for these multi-commodity derivatives products may be found in the attached document.

 	We are looking to build this business via utilizing as many of Enron's internal resources as possible.  Hence, it would be most helpful to meet with the relevant individuals in Gas Trading who would be interested in the development of multi-commodity derivatives trades/structures which may used to develop customized risk management tools for our clients.
	
	Thank you in advance for your assistance.
    
Kind regards,
Iris Mack, MBA/PhD
Enron Power Options Trading Desk

Probably not have time to do anything, I thought I would.  I am sorry.   I would like to meet for breakfast though.  Hope you have time.  

I miss you today.

i did not get to speak to shelly last night.   i got home about 8:30 pm.  i just went driving around montrose and i found some duplexes and fourplex apts.  
then i had dinner late with my cousin and my friend mike and came home and went to bed.    i have just been in this funky mood - dont know why...

Hi my little piggy.  Don't be sad, ok?  Everything is going to be great,

Is it possible to make me more pink forms?  Are you out of pink paper?  It
can wait until tomorrow.  Just let me know.

What time do you think you will be home?  Love YOU!

IntercontinentalExchange is pleased to announce  that weather swaps trading will be included in its new version 8 release. These  fixed-for-floating financial products will be cash settled on a five-day average  temperature, Monday - Friday, for the current week and for the forward week.  Temperatures used for the settlement of these products will be those reported  by EarthSat, a widely recognized and independent source of weather data. Settlement  temperatures provided by EarthSat will be available via the IntercontinentalExchange  website. The hub locations for weather trades will be the primary airport weather  stations at Chicago-O'Hare, Dallas-Fort Worth, New York-La Guardia, Philadelphia-International  and Sacramento-Executive. The standard contract size for all locations will  be $10,000 per degree Fahrenheit, with a tic increment of 0.1 degree Fahrenheit  or $1,000. There are no payout limits on the contracts. 
The design and development of these new weather  products was done under the guidance of Aquila Energy Marketing Corp., a recognized  leader in weather product concepts. In addition, IntercontinentalExchange has  worked with Aquila and other major weather market participants, including Reliant  Energy, Mirant Americas, and El Paso Merchant Energy, to build consensus and  support for these new products.
To trade weather swaps you must have our new version 8 release installed on your system. An advisory  with details about this new release is being sent to you by separate email.  
We encourage all or our users to take a serious  look at the new weather products being offered by the IntercontinentalExchange.  Please contact one of our following representatives to find out about the new  weather products, or check back on our website product guide:

John-
Thanks for asking- i am glad you try to get more information before forming opinions. I have also posted an article of the fundy website due to requests by Hunter which you might find informative.

The anti-west opinion is definitely a minority opinion. However, as we have seen in the past even in U.S minorities like KKK, terrorists, mass murderers, religious fanatics pose the biggest threat and try to get the most publicity and unfortunately they are succeeding for right now.  I think the educated population felt betrayed by the west in fighting fundamentalism uptil now but they support this move. But you have to understand that most of the big cities in Pakistan are within the range of the Taliban Scud missiles. Thats why support is a very relative term here.

The general does not have any political mandate- he came into power through a military coup. However, the previously democratically elected governments were notorious for corruption(including the government of Benazir Bhutto- the first women head of state of Pakistan who was educated in Harvard and Oxford). So people by default support any other alternative and military is probably the ony institution that is relatively untouched by corruption. Most of the cabinet and ministers right now are liberals and among them are some that gave up extremely lucrative jobs in U.S in order to try to help put the country back on track economically.

Let me send you an article from the TIME mag. that kind of explains why the President of Pakistan is in a fix. 
http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,175058,00.html


Also below is part of an article from a Pakistani newspaper explaining how the President met with all the political and religious parties and explained to them why he supports the U.S - In the article the PPP and PML are the two major parties in Pakistan. Just like the Democrats and Republicans here... and the Jamati-i-Islami and the other parties are the religous parties.
He apprised the political leaders that the US administration had demanded concrete actions as a proof of friendship. 

The measures that Washington wanted Islamabad to take included allowing American troops to use Naval facilities and airspace and sharing of all intelligence reports about Osama bin Laden's movement inside Afghanistan. Otherwise, the president told the politicians, Washington had warned that it would treat Pakistan as a country harbouring terrorists. 

In that case, the president said, no strategic installations would have remained safe. "I could not take that risk," the source quoted President Musharraf as having said. The president said that he could risk his life but he could not put the whole country at risk. 

The US authorities had also conveyed to President Musharraf that they had the technological capability to smoke out the Taliban or Osama out of their holes. This was interpreted by the politicians as a threat to use chemical or biological weapons in Afghanistan. 

Having received these explanations, main stream political parties, including the PPP and the PML (like-minded), backed the president's decision and said the country should rally round the government, the source said. 

However, Jamaat-i-Islami and Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (both Maulana Sami and Maulana Fazl groups) opposed the decision and asked the government to review its policy. They insisted that the government should demand for a credible evidence of Osama's involvement in the Sept 11 attacks on the US soil. 

Hope this helps you understand the cuurent situation without confusing you too much....
Bilal

Hey Bilal,

How are you doing?  I just wanted to ask you some questions about Pakistan if you don't mind.  I see some articles about protestors in Pakistan, protesting the US.  I can understand that, however, do you think this is the mijority opinion of Pakistan people, or are these protests happening in areas that are predominately backing the Taliban.  What do the educated population think?  Does the general have any backing from the people themselves?  

What is your opinion?

I understand that these things are very personal to you.  Please let me know if I am prying.  I just wanted to get someone's opinion that actually knows what is going on and not from the news.

Thanks.

John

Weather Headlines
Thursday January 10, 2002
It still appears we will lose the unseasonable warmth in the Plains this
weekend, but the true arctic remains bottled. Models tone down any East
Coast storm for the weekend and show signs of shifting a trough into the
West.
A cold front will push through the Northern Plains ending the record warmth
of recent days. But, I still do not see any brutal cold heading into the
region in the short term(and longer) so numbers will continue on the warmer
side of normal. This warm air continues to spread out to the East and
slowly redeveloping to the South as well. Weak to moderate weather systems
will traverse the Plains and East with light amounts of rain and snow,
nothing significant here. A stronger system crashes into the Pacific NW
this weekend only to fall apart into the Great Basin high that has been
anchored the last couple of weeks. My five day numbers for temperatures
remain above normal almost coast to coast though again the Plains will be
cooler than recent days.
The NWS 6-10 and 8-14 day outlooks continue to indicate some cold air
potential. I continue to disagree on the magnitude and southward extent. As
I mentioned yesterday, they can verify correctly if you are one degree
below normal as their forecast is a probability scheme. I can't totally
rule out some arctic air in the normally frigid northern U.S. this time of
year, but current patterns and charts convince me it would be extremely
difficult to send this air very far South. The MRF and its ensembles remain
in the camp of a trough East and ridge holding in the West. The European
and Canadian models hint in the 6-10 day period of a pattern reversal with
more of a trough in the West and ridge in the East. This ridge would not
have near the amplitude of the one that produced the record warm November
and December, but it would effectively choke off any cold air East of the
Mississippi. I think the European/Canadian combo has done a much better job
than the MRF this year and may be a believable solution. The one change it
does result in though is an opportunity to drive some cold air into the
sparsely populated areas of the Interior NW and Rockies.
For the period Thursday January 10 through Monday January 14, expect the
following temperature trends:
Average 1 to 3-degrees below normal: Florida?
Average 1 to 3-above normal: Southeast, Pacific NW...
Average 4 to 6-degrees above normal: Gulf Coast, Mid-Atlantic, Southern
Plains and Rockies, Desert SW, California, Intermountain West...
Average 7 to 10-degrees above normal: Northeast, Great Lakes, Ohio and
Mississippi Valleys?
Average 11 to locally 20-degrees above normal: Central and Northern
Rockies, Central and Northern Plains...

Good morning, how are you?  Quite a change huh?  I like it here.  The only problem is the heat from the monitors.  The heat, My god the heat (a Seinfeld episode).  Anyway, I like it over here.  Really nice.  

How do you like you new space?  is it okay?  I like being able to peak over and see you.  The table has turned.  You have to get up and look back to see me now.  Ha.

I bought you something small this weekend.  I will give it to you later.  It is nothing that important but I thought it was cute. 

Oh well, I guess I better work.

Have a great day and I hope to talk to you later.

John

Hello friends. I'm engaged in yet another bizarre art event. I hope 
to see you there. Details below >>>
00> Cockfight Arena <00
C-level, Chinatown Los Angeles
Saturday Nov. 10th
7pm - 11pm
The creators of Tekken Torture Tournament are proud to bring you 
Cockfight Arena. A one night parade of sweat and adrenaline pitting 
viewer against viewer in brutal virtual cockfighting theatre. After 
entering our dimly lit basement space, audience volunteers will don 
custom-made wireless game controllers with full sized wings and 
feathered helmets. Combatants will step into an arena to control 
their life size game avatars through vigorous flapping and pecking, 
competing for blood and birdfeed while rapaciously inflicting 
onscreen bodily harm.
:::
Cockfight Arena is free and open to the public. Gambling and smoking 
will be permitted. No animals or humans were injured in the 
production of this event.
:::
C-level is a cooperative public and private lab formed to share 
physical, social and technological resources. Its members are 
artists, programmers, writers, designers, agit-propers, filmmakers 
and reverse-engineers. Part studio, part club, part stage and part 
screen; C-Level is located in a basement in Chinatown Los Angeles and 
plays host to various events such as screenings, performances, 
lectures, debates, dances, readings and tournaments.

John,

Since you seem to be swamped in things that need to be done and I have a strong interest in options trading, I would like to offer any time that I have outside my Gas Structuring obligations to help you with anything that might help make your job easier. I realize some of the tasks may be somewhat mundane but hopefully I will also get a good understanding of how you do your job.

Regards,

cjc

John,
 
I tried to call you at work a little while ago, but they said you were gone for the day.  My cable modem has been out all day long and just came up 2-3 minutes ago.  
 
Sorry for not getting you a solution before you left.  I will look at the file (I see it in my inbox) and if I can tell you how to apply the fix, I'll send you a note.
 
Greg

   I am sorry, I did get your message the next day, Angie was on the

   and she got off for me to call you, then she got back on, that is our
   only
   line, she is on the computer most of the time working, I am sorry I
   didn't
   call you, I do love and miss you as well, I do have some issues but they
   do
   not involve you or the family, just some work mainly also some others as
   well, I am sorry I didn't talk earlier, just real busy today, I will
   call
   you around noon when things slow down.  Please forgive me.

   I am sorry about the kids not knowing their uncle as well.  I will have
   to
   change that.

   Please forgive me and give me another chance I will not screw things up.

   Love you very much

John,

My name is Adrian Clark, I am an executive recruiter in the energy industry.
One of my industry sources gave me your name but was not specific as to what
you do for Enron.  My firm, First Call Associates, is currently doing a
search for qualified front office personnel to present to our clients.  I
would like to know more about your background so I can discuss potential new
job opportunities if you are interested.  If the timing is not right for you
at this time, I've included my contact information for future reference.

You can find more information about my firm at www.firstcallassociates.com.
We are very familiar with the nuances of the energy trading business and
have built relationships with many energy companies in North America
enabling us to present qualified employees for their consideration.  Be
assured that any information we discuss will be completely confidential.  My
apologies for sending this to your email at work but I have not been able to
reach you by telephone during business hours.

Hey sugar, how are you doing?  Did you sleep okay?  I had weird dreams,
I think because I ate then went straight to bed.  I am a puffy frog
today.  Need to be popped.
I forgot about the option class that John is giving today @ 2pm, I don't
know how long it will last, but I do want to join them.  I will probably
learn something.
I hope you have a wonderful day, tell the crazies hi.  
Talk to you later my sugar, IT IS THE WEEKEND, YEAH.  I get to spend
time with my baby.  Love you very much.

Weather Headlines
Wednesday January 9, 2002
Bismarck, North Dakota was warmer yesterday than Miami, Florida! Overall
weather pattern still finds bitter cold arctic air lurking... in the NW
territories.
Bismarck was 38 degrees above normal yesterday at 63 while Miami was about
12 degrees below normal at 61. Its all a product of the jet stream pattern
which has taken modified Canadian air deep into the South while allowing a
downslope wind off the Rockies to really warm up the Plains. This warm air
is heading East and will attack the Ohio Valley and East Coast snow cover
with a vengeance the next couple of days. I do see a reversal of
temperatures gradually occurring in the South the rest of the week as the
deep trough weakens. The current quiet pattern will become a little more
active in the storm department later in the week. There is a benign looking
system on the West Coast today which may redevelop over the Lower
Mississippi Valley this weekend. While I would not give this a "major
storm" designation, it could provide the East some snow late in the period.
In addition, another moderate cold front in the Northern branch will end
the unseasonable warmth in the Plains this weekend, but I would hardly call
it cold. The five day numbers will still grade out well above normal. The
stagnant pattern in the West looks to continue as high pressure remains
anchored over the Great Basin. Storms coming in off the Pacific have a
small punch as they hit the coast, but rapidly weaken once inland. Overall,
temperatures there look to remain a bit above normal.
My mid range forecast continues to disagree with many who are calling for
much colder air to invade the Northern U.S. The NWS 6-10 and 8-14 day
products seem to be leading this charge with strong probabilities of below
normal temperatures over much of the country especially in the 8-14 day
time frame. I think a mistake is being made in equating a large area of
below normal probabilities with very cold air. Keep in mind that in a
probability forecast one degree below normal grades out the same as 30
degrees below normal. There are two distinct branches of the jet stream
right now, but clearly the Pacific branch is more dominant in the U.S. than
the arctic branch. Repeated efforts at reversing that have not yet
materialized and I won't forecast that occurrence without more evidence. I
am not arguing against cooler than current weather or even the return to
below normal temperatures in the North next week. I just don't see the
whole motherlode of arctic air coming down. This outlook will bust big time
if I am wrong though if one looks at the extreme cold being predicted on
the end panels (days 14-16) of the MRF in NW Canada. Those readings are as
cold as anything I have ever seen. But, they are at the end of the long
range and in NW Canada. I think it has been proven several times already
this winter it is very premature to bring that air down though if you
hammer at it often enough it may eventually happen.
For the period Wednesday January 9 through Sunday January 13, expect the
following temperature trends:
Average 1 to 3-degrees below normal: Southeast?
Average 1 to 3-above normal: Gulf Coast, Mid-Atlantic...
Average 1 to 3-degrees above normal: Northeast, Ohio Valley...
Average 4 to 9-degrees above normal: Northeast, Great Lakes, Ohio and
Mississippi Valleys, Southern Plains and Rockies, California, Intermountain
West, Desert SW, Pacific NW?
Average 10 to locally 20-degrees above normal: Central and Northern
Rockies, Central and Northern Plains...

Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

Weather Headlines
Friday January 11, 2002
Big Storm may form off the New England coast this weekend. Energy from the
Pacific criss crosses the country next week. Arctic air gets closer but
remains North of the border.
The New England storm will be a near miss it appears this weekend as it
bombs out to sea. Perhaps Eastern Mass. gets a brush by but otherwise its a
light rain/snow wind event. The next system of note comes in to the NW this
weekend and develops low pressure in the Central Plains by Tuesday. North
of the track even though temperatures remain above normal, they won't be of
the record warmth this week. It will be cold enough to lay down some snow
North of 35 degrees Latitude. The SE then starts to warm up relative to
normal as high pressure slips off the coast. While it may be a seasonably
active period, five day temperature numbers will likely average above
normal nationwide.
I continue to see forecasts in the 6-10 day period calling for cold
weather. The NWS outlook is below normal almost nationwide. But, notice
they go near normal in the Northern Plains. That is significant as it
refers to source region of air masses. If the North is above normal short
term and near normal mid term then where is the alleged arctic air coming
from? What may actually happen is a re-development of the broad trough
occurs over the Eastern half of the country next week. That is straight out
of the MRF playbook. The operational runs of the Canadian and European do
not concur. I certainly accept no ridge in the Eastern U.S. but the bottom
line in my view is this still is not a very cold pattern. The NWS had NO
ONE , not one location above normal in their 6-10 day period. I think most
of the South and East will run above normal during the period, just not
excessively so. The North and West will run close to normal. Interestingly
enough, the European day 10 looks to be the coldest of the medium range
models. Since it seems to be my favorite this winter, there could be some
credibility to some arctic air the last 10 days of the month. But, even its
appearance makes it difficult in my view for any real cold to get very far
South.
For the period Friday January 11 through Tuesday January 15, expect the
following temperature trends:
Average 1 to 3-above normal: Southeast, Pacific NW, California...
Average 4 to 6-degrees above normal: Gulf Coast, Mid-Atlantic, Southern
Plains and Rockies, Desert SW, Intermountain West...
Average 7 to 9-degrees above normal: Northeast, Great Lakes, Ohio and
Mississippi Valleys?
Average 10 to 15-degrees above normal: Central and Northern Rockies,
Central and Northern Plains...

Actually sugar what I need is a copy of my resume.  Mike Heffner wants it.  If you log into my computer at home and go to the email you can send me an email from there and attach my resume.  It is in the C:\drive under Documents and Settings under Resume and I think it is called Resume1.  If you get a chance.  I love you.

As things begin to calm down somewhat after events of last week, we wanted to update all employees of certain organizational and personnel changes that have occurred recently.

Organizational Matters
The Creditors' Committee was formed last week by the United States Trustee.  This committee is comprised of 15 individuals representing various creditor groups including: banks, bondholders, insurance companies and employees.  The Creditors' Committee will be the key point of contact as we reorganize the company and emerge from Chapter 11.  Initially, they will send financial advisors to our offices to monitor any asset liquidations as well as review our cash flow projections.  Ultimately, they will be responsible for approving our reorganization plan as to which assets or businesses we sell and which ones we retain.

>From an Enron perspective, the plans for reorganization have already begun.  Overhead has been reduced dramatically, certain employee retention programs have been put in place and a wider retention program is currently being developed.  We hope to share the wider retention program with you in the very near future.  Furthermore, detail cash flow projections are in their final stages of preparation and will be reviewed by senior management this week.  This will be the critical first step in formulating our reorganization strategy to emerge from Chapter 11 as a healthy company.

By now, you must have heard of "NETCO." This company was formed as a means to maximize the value of Enron's most valuable business, the wholesale energy business.  Certain Enron North America employees have been assigned to NETCO to re-build the North American gas and power business under different ownership.  We will be filing with the bankruptcy court this week proposed auction procedures to allow bidders to bid for NETCO.  It is our expectation that Enron would retain a 49 percent (or perhaps less) non-controlling interest in NETCO.  The NETCO employees would become employees of the winning bidder.  We anticipate this process to reach closure sometime in January.

As for the remaining businesses of Enron, they are all under review as to which ones will be proposed for sale and which ones will be proposed for retention.  This review process will take time as it will require approval of the Creditors' Committee.  We will update you periodically on our process.

Personnel Matters
As a result of our current situation, we have made many personnel changes over the past several months to maximize the value of the organization.

Office of the Chairman - Enron Corp
Jeff McMahon, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has been added to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Corp along with Ken Lay and Greg Whalley.  Among other things, Jeff has been working on the business plan for reorganization in Chapter 11 and is the primary contact with the newly formed Creditor's Committee.

Treasurer - Enron Corp
Ray Bowen was elected to Executive Vice President, Finance and Treasurer of Enron Corp recently.  In this role, Ray is responsible for all finance activities of Enron Corp.  Ray also has the lead role in managing the cash activities of the company on a day to day basis.

Corporate Development
Mark Muller has been appointed Executive Vice President - Corporate Development.  In this role, Mark will work with Enron's various business units on all asset disposals, which will be a key element in Enron's reorganization plan and value preservation.

Wholesale Services
The Wholesale Services group has been reorganized under the leadership of Jim Fallon.  Included in this group are the following businesses, ENA, EBS, EIM and EGM.  As part of the Chapter 11 reorganization, efforts in these businesses will be directed at maximizing value for the creditors as well as determining which businesses or assets will be part of Enron's reorganization plan.

Management Committee Departures
Unfortunately, due to the current financial condition of the company, the following members of the management committee have left the company or will be leaving the company by the end of December:

Michael Brown
Mark Frevert
Steve Kean
Mike McConnell
Jeff Shankman

Additionally, John Lavorato and Louise Kitchen have resigned from the Management Committee to arrange for the joint venture energy activities of NETCO.

We know as employees the uncertainty surrounding the future of the company is unsettling.  Unfortunately, that aspect will not change in the near term.  We ask for everyone's patience and continued support as we move forward through the Chapter 11 process.  We are committed to reorganizing into a strong company once again and will need the help of all the employees to achieve that goal.

As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

All:

Attached you will find a list that reflects your seat assignments for Business Continuity Planning (BCP).  These seats are located on the 30th and 31st Floors of Enron Center North (ECN).  As previously communicated, you will report to these designated seats in the event of an outage in ECS.

The exception to this is as follows:
If your seat assignment is located on the 31st Floor, you will report to your original location that you occupied prior to your move into ECS.  This will hold true until the Monday after Thanksgiving, as we will have the 31st floor seats set up at that time.

Testing:
Once you have moved to ECS, if you would like to test your BCP location, you will be able to test your seat for functionality every Thursday from 3-6pm.  Testing is not required, but is highly recommended.

If anyone has any questions or concerns about these procedures, please feel free to contact me at any time.

I hate to have to say this, but there will be no more Mark Report in the year 2002.  I have decided not to stay on with the new UBS/Enron trading company.  It has been pleasure working with everyone and provided interesting and sometimes humorous commentary on the energy markets.  I hope to continue to stay in touch with some of you, but I will be moving on to a crude trading position at a major oil company here in Houston.  Good luck and keep hedging!

Subject:	**IMPORTANT** Stack Manager Users
Importance:	High


We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. 

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your "native" desktop.

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding "1" or a "2" in the subject field.

If you're not sure which one you have, please contact myself x39673, Teresa Mandola x39807 or Jennifer McQuade x53614 and we'll come by your desk to help you.

Thank you,

Dan Diamond

During the next 60 seconds, stop whatever you are  doing, and take this 
opportunity. (Literally it is only  1 minute) All you have to do is the 
following:  
You simply say an "Our Father" for the person that sent you  this message: 
Our Father who art in Heaven, Hallowed be Thy Name, Thy Kingdom  Come, Thy 
Will be done, on Earth as it is in Heaven.  Give us this day our daily 
bread and forgive us our  trespasses as we forgive those who trespass 
against us,  and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil. For 
Thine is the Kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever,  Amen. 
Next, you send this message to everyone you know. In awhile,  more people 
will have prayed for you and you would have  obtained a lot of people 
praying for others. 
Next, stop and think and appreciate God's power in your life,  for doing 
what you know is pleasing to him. If you are  not ashamed to do this, 
follow the instructions. Jesus  said, "If you are ashamed of me, I will be 
ashamed of  you before My Father" 
If you are not ashamed, send this message...only if you believe.  "Yes, I 
love my God. He is my fountain of Life and My  Savior. He keeps me going day 
and night. Without Him, I  am no one. But with Him, I can do everything. 
Christ is  my strength." This is a simple test. If you love God and you are  
not ashamed of all the great things that He  has done for you, send this to 
everyone you know, and  the person who sent it to you. Thanks!!!

Hey sugar, good morning how are you doing?  Thanks for the ride into
work.  I love and miss you very much.  I can't wait until this next
weekend.  I found the car charger and it fits the phone, so we are set
to keep the phone in the car.  That will be good for you.  I worry about
you when you are alone.  Have a wonderful day and I will talk to you
later.  Don't work too hard.  
Love you
The soon to be red chili pepper pistachio bellied Piggy

I just wanted everyone to know that I begin my new radio shift tomorrow
morning.  For those who are able to tune in on the radio, it's 91.7.  For
those who plan to listen over the Internet, it's www.ktru.org.  I'll be on
every other Tuesday morning from 7-9 AM until December.  Feel free to call
up and make requests or just to say "hi".  Also, if you're interested in
checking out set lists from my previous shows, go to the Web site and search
by ChrisB.

Rock on,

Chris Ballou
aka DJ Grils Baloy

This article kind of explains the sentiments of the people seen protesting against the current attacks. Also the article touches briefly on the disastrous effects of siding with America, during cold war, on Pakistan but i think with a lesson from previous experience both countries can do much better this time. Also the government is firmly behind the U.S coalition

Here is an update of some recent Enron developments.

Enron Europe Closes Certain Operations

Following Enron's credit rating downgrade yesterday and the impact that had on Enron Europe's ability to trade, Enron Europe has asked a court to appoint an Administrator.  What this means is that PricewaterhouseCoopers has been appointed the Administrator to handle the liquidation of the company's major physical assets and trading positions.  This action does not include Enron Credit, Enron Direct, Enron Metals, Teesside Power Station or the utilities and service businesses at the Wilton chemical complex.  It also does not include Wessex Water or power plants in Turkey, Italy and Poland.

Efforts are being made to preserve as much of the business as possible.  There is already interest by outside parties to buy Enron Europe's metals business, and negotiations are expected to lead to a successful deal in the near term.

This action will impact a significant number of Enron Europe's employees.  Every effort is being made to retain as many employees as possible who are part of businesses that may be preserved.

Enron Appoints New Board Member

Yesterday, Enron announced the election of Raymond S. Troubh to the Board of Directors.  Mr. Troubh will chair a newly-formed Special Litigation Committee of the Board to evaluate claims in shareholder and other derivative lawsuits.  He will also serve on the Special Committee set up to investigate all of the SEC-related matters.  Mr. Troubh is a financial consultant in New York City and has been a non-executive director of more than 25 public companies.  Board member William C. Powers, Jr. will also serve on the Special Litigation Committee.

Enron Evaluates Dividends

Today Enron announced that it is evaluating whether previously declared dividends will be paid on Enron common stock and other Enron equities.

New Enron Employee Q&A

A new Q&A has been posted to <http://home.enron.com/updates/> based on recent developments and employee concerns.

Hey sugar, how are you doing?  I think I will be able to get home around 1-1:30.  Is that okay?  

Also, there are a few UBS people flying in tonite that I have been asked to go to dinner with them.  It should be an early dinner, probably around 6:30.  Is that okay?  Mike, Dutch and I have been asked to go to dinner with them.

Call me when you get a chance.  Love and miss you very much.

Weather Headlines
Thursday November 15, 2001

*** Pattern change to colder still on track for Thanksgiving Week. Unusual
warmth and dryness to dominate most of the country through the  weekend.
***

     The only heavy rain of note on the map today is in Texas. A cut-off
Low in the SW is responsible for this and is also generating some cool air
underneath the upper low. A developing storm off the SE coast has been a
rain and wind maker for Florida, but its effects are lessening as the
system moves away. I am hard pressed to find any other significant weather
other than warmth across the Lower 48 and that trend should hold until the
weekend. By Sunday, colder air that is building across Canada will have a
mechanism to start its descent South. This cold front will not have a lot
of moisture to work with so I don't at this time see any big storm
developing, just wind and a temperature drop of some 30 degrees in many
areas. As I look at the trajectory of high pressure coming down out of
Canada, the continental divide continues to be a good cutoff point for the
Western intrusion of any cold air. This will be mainly an Eastern U.S.
event with a ridge in the West and trough in the East. Again, it only just
gets underway late in the short term period, so five day temperatures will
still average well above normal for most of the country.

     The now beaten to death pattern change plays a more prominent role in
the 6-10 day forecast. In a nutshell, most of the country this period East
of the Rockies will come out below normal. I accept this, but my often
repeated concerns of degree and duration remain. The models are in somewhat
of a conflict in this area as well. Often, they will revert back to a zonal
flow a little too quickly. That is probably the case here, but given there
is some support among the ensembles just after Thanksgiving, the trend may
be on line. I should point out though that a return to zonal flow late next
week is NOT a return to the same current pattern. I would expect the jet
stream to be suppressed farther South than its recent pattern. If it all
verifies, late in the 6-10 day period, temperatures should return back to
near if not above seasonal norms for most of the Midwest, just not to the
degree we have seen lately. Models are also in disagreement about another
cold outbreak in early December. Since it is outside this time frame and
needs more study on my account, I will refrain from any additional comment.

For the period Thursday November 15 through Monday November 19, expect the
following temperature trends:

Average 1 to 3-degrees below normal: Southern Plains ?

Average 1 to 3-degrees above normal: Southeast, Mid-Atlantic, Gulf Coast,
Desert SW,  California, Pacific NW?

Average 4 to 6-degrees above normal: Mississippi Valley, Southern Rockies,
Intermountain West?

Average 7 to 12-degrees above normal: Northeast,  Ohio Valley, Great Lakes,
Central Rockies and Plains?

Average 13 to 18-degrees above normal: Northern Rockies and Plains?

Hey sugar, what is going on?  I love and miss you.  Today is the weekend.  Yippee.  I cant wait.  Enron stock is now below $5.  I think that that is not good, however, as long as our credit rating stays where it is, then we are okay.  We will see.

By the way sugar, Mike just asked me to play golf at 7:40 am friday morning.  Do you mind if I play?  It is not a big deal but I would like to spend some time with mike outside of work, especially in light of what is going on.  Just let me know.

Love you

The Pigs

hi,

Good morning, how are you?  Quite a change huh?  I like it here.  The only problem is the heat from the monitors.  The heat, My god the heat (a Seinfeld episode).  Anyway, I like it over here.  Really nice.  

How do you like you new space?  is it okay?  I like being able to peak over and see you.  The table has turned.  You have to get up and look back to see me now.  Ha.

I bought you something small this weekend.  I will give it to you later.  It is nothing that important but I thought it was cute. 

Oh well, I guess I better work.

Have a great day and I hope to talk to you later.

John

Weather Headlines
Monday January 21, 2002
The battle rages on between the polar vortex and the Caribbean ridge. While
widespread cold is still not likely, widespread storminess is.
The above headlines are the same from my last post six days ago. That
pattern seems to have verified well and it looks to continue through this
week as well. One notable difference though is the trough in the West is
stronger as well as the ridge in the East. This will have an effect on
temperatures and subsequent precipitation type. A series of storms should
move through the nation this week. A couple of them look noteworthy. In the
Eastern U.S. the rain/snow line should be much farther North this time
around. In fact, enough warm air could be in place over the deep South for
a severe weather outbreak Wednesday and Thursday. There could be some
decent snows in the NE again late in the period, but the storm system will
need to take a more Northerly track than I expect. A strong SW flow of air
will overwhelm the Eastern half of the nation with double digit above
normal air, especially once the melting of this weekends snowfall is
finished. The trough in the West is sufficiently strong to produce below
normal temperatures this week West of the divide. Precipitation could
become quite heavy later in the week especially in the Pacific NW. There is
a slight concern that arctic air could get into the Pacific NW late in the
period. There continues to be an abundance in Western Canada. I have seen
reports of temperatures in Northern Saskatchewan this weekend approaching
60 below zero. It is too close to dismiss entirely, but I still see no real
sign of it pressing Southward.
Here is a shocker for those interested in the 6-10 day period. The MRF
brings a significant shot of arctic air into the Northern U.S.! I guess
this continues to be a case of predict it often enough and you'll
eventually be right. To be fair, there was some cold this weekend in the
Northern Plains. Minneapolis dropped below zero for the first time this
winter Saturday morning. Of course the normal low for the date is around 3
degrees. Again I suppose it can't be entirely written off since its in the
Canadian vicinity. But, it remains locked to the North on the Canadian and
European solutions and I'll stay on the same horse until bucked. This
battle only applies to the far North anyway as all signs show the Southern
half of the country arctic free and largely above normal.
For the period Monday January 21 through Friday January 25, expect the
following temperature trends:
Average 4 to 6-degrees below normal: Intermountain West, Desert SW,
California...
Average 1 to 3- degrees below normal: Pacific NW...
Average 1 to 3-degrees above normal: Southern Plains and Rockies...
Average 4 to 6-degrees above normal: Gulf Coast, Southeast, Central Plains,
Mississippi Valley, Northern and Central Rockies...
Average 7 to 12-degrees above normal: Northern Plains, Great Lakes, Ohio
Valley, Mid-Atlantic, Northeast...

Good morning, how are you this morning?  You look good as usual.  Did you have a good time last nite?  I missed being with you this morning.  It is a nice way to start the day.  I hope that everything works out with us.  I don't want to put you in a bad situation, I care about you too much.  Have a great day and I will talk/email you soon.

I am sorry, I did get your message the next day, Angie was on the computer
and she got off for me to call you, then she got back on, that is our only
line, she is on the computer most of the time working, I am sorry I didn't
call you, I do love and miss you as well, I do have some issues but they do
not involve you or the family, just some work mainly also some others as
well, I am sorry I didn't talk earlier, just real busy today, I will call
you around noon when things slow down.  Please forgive me.

I am sorry about the kids not knowing their uncle as well.  I will have to
change that.

Please forgive me and give me another chance I will not screw things up.

Love you very much

This had most of the state of Michigan laughing for 2 days and a very
embarrassed female news anchor who will, in the future, likely think
before she speaks.

What happens when you predict snow but don't get any....

True story...we had a female news anchor who, the day after it was
supposed to have snowed and didn't, turned to the weatherman and asked
"So
Bob, where's that 8 inches you promised me last night?"

Not only did HE have to leave the set, but half the crew did too, they
were laughing so hard!

   I am sorry, I did get your message the next day, Angie was on the
   computer
   and she got off for me to call you, then she got back on, that is our
   only
   line, she is on the computer most of the time working, I am sorry I
   didn't
   call you, I do love and miss you as well, I do have some issues but they
   do
   not involve you or the family, just some work mainly also some others as
   well, I am sorry I didn't talk earlier, just real busy today, I will
   call
   you around noon when things slow down.  Please forgive me.

   I am sorry about the kids not knowing their uncle as well.  I will have
   to
   change that.

   Please forgive me and give me another chance I will not screw things up.

   Love you very much

   J-Boy

      You called me the other night.....on my mobile and at home....you
   also
      left
      a message that you would
      call back sometime this weekend...I called your house not 1 minute
   after
      you
      called my mobile...you wouldn't answer....
      I also left messages several times after that....If that is the best
   you
      can
      do...then I don't need it....
      Someone has to stand up and say that's not good enough!!!!!    Family
      doesn't treat family that way!!!!!
      Enough is enough!!!!!!!!!       My kids don't even know who Uncle
      Johnny
      Boy is any more...and that is a shame!!!!
      I love you more than a real brother and I am truly sorry if this
   hurts
      your
      feelings...hell, you might decide to even not talk to me any
   more....but
      it
      sorta seems like you alraedy decided that...so I don't have anything
   to
      lose
      by sending this...
      I still love you whether you want to love me back or not.....Mike

I grew up in Lahore which is about 100-150 miles from Islamabad(the capital)- My parents are still settled there. Its not as advanced at most of the big cities here but it is pretty. Parts of Pakistan - in the north are actually a hikers paradise. Very green, very pretty and not very commercial- not like the more dry rugged areas in Afghanistan. The country on the whole has a very low literacy rate and that is the root cause for a lot of problems that we are currently seeing. There are a lot of Europeans/mainly English who are settled in Pakistan for years and infect my mother/aunt and most of my family have studied in Catholic schools. That side of the story often goes untold.   
Eventhough a lot of people oppose the U.S led attacks you would be surprised at how many people in Pakistan support the attacks on Afghanistan. Those who oppose ar ejust more militant and vocal but not the majority by any means.  Most are just afraid of their security. Also they feel that they are already so poor that they cannot afford to go to war. But i think if this goes well it would be really good for the country.
As for American foreign policy. I think its has a lot of short term focus and can improve but then again it is always easy to criticize somebody on the top. The good things achieved by Americans is often conviniently forgotten.

thank you

so it looks like if Pakistan supports the US, the US better be ready to help out in the future.  It is like the US is supporting whoever they think will help them best at that time.  Not that I am supporting the US but that is probably what most countries do anyway, right?

anyway i hope your family is okay and that everything will work out for the best, none of us want people like the terrorist running around the world free, whether they be middle eastern, american, israeli whatever.

by the way what city does your parents live in?  did you grow up there?  is it a nice city?  sorry for the questions.  I am just interested in other cultures.

Subject:	RE: 

John-
Thanks for asking- i am glad you try to get more information before forming opinions. I have also posted an article of the fundy website due to requests by Hunter which you might find informative.

The anti-west opinion is definitely a minority opinion. However, as we have seen in the past even in U.S minorities like KKK, terrorists, mass murderers, religious fanatics pose the biggest threat and try to get the most publicity and unfortunately they are succeeding for right now.  I think the educated population felt betrayed by the west in fighting fundamentalism uptil now but they support this move. But you have to understand that most of the big cities in Pakistan are within the range of the Taliban Scud missiles. Thats why support is a very relative term here.

The general does not have any political mandate- he came into power through a military coup. However, the previously democratically elected governments were notorious for corruption(including the government of Benazir Bhutto- the first women head of state of Pakistan who was educated in Harvard and Oxford). So people by default support any other alternative and military is probably the ony institution that is relatively untouched by corruption. Most of the cabinet and ministers right now are liberals and among them are some that gave up extremely lucrative jobs in U.S in order to try to help put the country back on track economically.

Let me send you an article from the TIME mag. that kind of explains why the President of Pakistan is in a fix. 
http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,175058,00.html


Also below is part of an article from a Pakistani newspaper explaining how the President met with all the political and religious parties and explained to them why he supports the U.S - In the article the PPP and PML are the two major parties in Pakistan. Just like the Democrats and Republicans here... and the Jamati-i-Islami and the other parties are the religous parties.
He apprised the political leaders that the US administration had demanded concrete actions as a proof of friendship. 

The measures that Washington wanted Islamabad to take included allowing American troops to use Naval facilities and airspace and sharing of all intelligence reports about Osama bin Laden's movement inside Afghanistan. Otherwise, the president told the politicians, Washington had warned that it would treat Pakistan as a country harbouring terrorists. 

In that case, the president said, no strategic installations would have remained safe. "I could not take that risk," the source quoted President Musharraf as having said. The president said that he could risk his life but he could not put the whole country at risk. 

The US authorities had also conveyed to President Musharraf that they had the technological capability to smoke out the Taliban or Osama out of their holes. This was interpreted by the politicians as a threat to use chemical or biological weapons in Afghanistan. 

Having received these explanations, main stream political parties, including the PPP and the PML (like-minded), backed the president's decision and said the country should rally round the government, the source said. 

However, Jamaat-i-Islami and Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (both Maulana Sami and Maulana Fazl groups) opposed the decision and asked the government to review its policy. They insisted that the government should demand for a credible evidence of Osama's involvement in the Sept 11 attacks on the US soil. 

Hope this helps you understand the cuurent situation without confusing you too much....
Bilal

Hey Bilal,

How are you doing?  I just wanted to ask you some questions about Pakistan if you don't mind.  I see some articles about protestors in Pakistan, protesting the US.  I can understand that, however, do you think this is the mijority opinion of Pakistan people, or are these protests happening in areas that are predominately backing the Taliban.  What do the educated population think?  Does the general have any backing from the people themselves?  

What is your opinion?

I understand that these things are very personal to you.  Please let me know if I am prying.  I just wanted to get someone's opinion that actually knows what is going on and not from the news.

Thanks.

John

John,
 
We haven't had the chance to talk the last 2-3 days (only briefly today), so I just wanted you to know I haven't forgotten about you and I am doing what I can to get your stuff finished alongside my other to-do items.  
 
As we discussed this evening, I know I still owe you your desired modifications to the input screens.  I believe we are functionally there, you just want some "look and feel" modifications.  Let me know if this you think of something different.
 
Also, if you begin using the valuation model again tomorrow morning, let me know how it goes (accuracy, morning macro, etc).  I really want this in production and I want it to be successful for you.
 
Hopefully things go well with the mods I've done to the valuation stuff.
 
Greg

In an effort to better organize the activities and minimize the expenses related to the Chapter 11 filing, we have formed the Bankruptcy Management Committee.  There are many outside firms representing multiple parties that will be requesting, among other things, certain tasks to be performed, filings with the bankruptcy court, financial analysis and general business information.  To ensure these activities are coordinated, the Bankruptcy Management Committee will now be responsible for overseeing this process.  The following is a list of some of the parties that may contact you directly.  If anyone from these firms, or other firms, contacts you related to the bankruptcy, please notify a member of the committee to ensure the efforts are coordinated.  All outside firms will be requested to notify a member of the committee prior to contacting other Enron personnel or outside parties, including the court and Creditors' Committee.

	Firm						Relationship

	Bankruptcy court (i.e. motions, etc.)		
	Creditors' Committee
	U.S. Trustee
	Ernst & Young					Accountants for the Creditor's Committee
	Houlihan, Lokey, Howard & Zukin		Financial advisors for the Creditors' Committee
Blackstone					Financial advisors for Enron
Batchelder and Partners				Financial advisors for Enron
Weil, Gotshal and Manges			Bankruptcy attorneys for Enron
Milbank Tweed					Attorneys for the Creditors' Committee
Andrews and Kurth				Attorneys for Enron Corp



The following are the members of the Bankruptcy Management Committee:

Ray Bowen - Chairman
Bob Butts
Jim Fallon
Dave Glassford
Dave Gorte
Mark Muller
Julia Murray
Lou Stoler

Initially, this committee will meet on a daily basis to organize all the bankruptcy related activities as well as to prioritize requests going to the Creditors' Committee and the court.  It is extremely important that the company provides accurate and timely information to the court, the Creditors' Committee and their advisors.  Accordingly, we request the assistance of all employees and outside firms in coordinating the bankruptcy efforts with this newly formed committee.

I hope that you foot is okay.  You need to be careful.  I liked the shoes though.  It is too bad you can't wear heels.  You look really good in them.  I guess no more hoochi wear for right now huh?

Weather Headlines
Tuesday January 8, 2002
Thaw underway for the short term. Longer range models continue to insist
(as I continue to resist) that real arctic air arrives later in the month.
There is some potential for yet another winter storm in the East late in
the five day period. The point in question is how much cold air is
available or is it just another cold rain for many folks. That will be
answered later in the week. The overall pattern definitely looks warmer for
now though some of this energy goes into melting snow cover rather than
warming the air. The absence of snow in the Plains is one reason why they
are so much warmer relative to normal than areas farther East. But, most of
the country goes warmer than normal before the end of the week. The last to
catch on to this trend is the Southeast.
I am not as bullish as the charts (and some forecasters) in regards to cold
air developing in the medium range period and beyond. I am not saying next
week and the week after will not be colder than this week, they likely will
be. But, I continue to have questions as to intensity and Southern extent
of whatever develops. First, we have yet to see any real polar flow so far
this winter. Second, lack of deep snow cover in the Northern U.S. tends to
inhibit bitter cold. Third, and perhaps most important to me is the lack of
high surface pressures developing over Canada. Now, they may develop
eventually, but I want to see it first. Finally, most models have more of a
West to East configuration at the jet stream level rather than a NW to SE
orientation straight out of the arctic. Given these conditions and recent
history I am just not ready yet to pronounce any major cold developing. In
fact, I would expect the Gulf Coast and SE to actually run warmer than
normal through the 20'th of the month. The Plains, Lakes and NE probably go
back to below normal levels, but not excessively so. It looks comparable to
the past couple of weeks. The West is expected to take on a temperature
profile that closely resembles normal Mid-January levels.
For the period Tuesday January 8 through Saturday January 12, expect the
following temperature trends:
Average 1 to 3-degrees below normal: Southeast?
Average 1 to 3-above normal: Gulf Coast, Mid-Atlantic...
Average 4 to 9-degrees above normal: Northeast, Great Lakes, Ohio and
Mississippi Valleys, Southern Plains and Rockies, California, Intermountain
West, Desert SW, Pacific NW?
Average 10 to locally 20-degrees above normal: Central and Northern
Rockies, Central and Northern Plains...

i miss you more and more each day.  have to leave at 3 to go and look at an apt that i saw in montrose area.  small apt complex.  we'll see how that turns out.

i dont think my band is playing this friday after all.  i think one of our members was not going to be in town so i think they booked someone else.

 Hey what is going on over there?  You look wonderful today (as usual).  Are you having a good day?  Thanks for the ride yesterday.  I know it was out of your way.  I enjoyed riding and talking to you.  I hope you did the same.
