Scott, Tammi told me that she has chosen not to sign the Employment 
Contract.  I understand her issues.  Even before she informed me of her 
decision I was thinking that we should support her for mid-year promotion to 
Director.  I would like to get your thoughts on this.

FYI...

I just wanted to let you know that I have been working with the settlements 
group in order to put approx. $800,000.00 into the Central and East desk 
books for Devon penalties that have been incurred over the last year.  
Settlements should be talking with the Risk group in order to get this done 
soon.   We are also working to determine the Pipeline cash out as a result of 
Panaco's imbalance over the last year.  After talking with legal it appears 
that we do have remedy to recoup cash out from Panaco. I'll keep you informed 
when I have more information.  If you have any questions please let me know.

Scott,
Nice chating with you yesterday. I am in Chicago today.

It's going to be interesting if we can grow the Ag. Group for Enron on the
Grain/Oilseed side. Think I can bring good value for them from the start,
they want to go global too,

Fyi, the guys that I met where Ted Noble, Darren Maloney and also Elsa

Saludos,

Pablo

PS: Thanks for leting Elsa now my references.

 Organization Announcement (Correction) 

I apologize for the confusion and inconvenience my mistake caused.  I had 
indicated that Kenneth Lovejoy would be supporting EES, but this is not 
correct.  Ken will be supporting  OEC.  Corrected announcement is provided 
below. 

 It is my pleasure to announce that Kenneth Lovejoy has joined Enron Corp. 
EH&S Asset Operations.  He will be reporting directly to Donnie Willmann and  
will support Central America, Caribbean and OEC.  Ken has over 25 year 
experience in environmental, health and safety for the oil and gas 
industry.   He has been working for Enron since 1996 and has extensive 
international experience.    We are excited to have Ken in our team so, 
please welcome Ken in his new role.

Scott, I would like to sue Kim in an expanded role within the group. She will 
still be responsible for all of her current activities but will also work 
with the group on Pipeline postings and expansions, RFP and information 
responses, Development of Presentations, etc.  I think that in the long run 
she can develop and be moved into other positions.  Especially after she 
earns her degree.  I have spoken with HR.  We will monitor to assure that she 
does not let any of her curent responsibilities slide.  Let me know if you 
have and concerns.


Also, I have completed the Performance plan for John Hodge ( Required due to 
his ranking in 2000).  I will leave a copy on your desk for review and 
execution.  Let me know if you have any questions.

PLEASE LET US KNOW YOUR AVAILABILITY!

The Environmental Strategies Group will convene an "Emissions Strategy 
Meeting" in mid-May to discuss global emissions issues -- such as climate 
change and U.S. multipollutant legislation -- and explore some of the 
potential business opportunities for Enron commercial groups.

The primary objectives of the session are to 1) provide you with the latest 
information on emissions regulation, markets, and Enron's advocacy efforts 
worldwide and 2) receive feedback on your commercial interests and input on 
policy options so that we may develop the best business and policy strategies 
for Enron in both the short and long term.  We invite you or a member of your 
group to participate in this important strategic discussion.

Our target dates are May 16, 17 or 18 in Houston (likely time is 10 a.m. - 12 
p.m.).  Please respond immediately with your best available dates so we can 
finalize our arrangements.

Please review the attached invitation and preliminary agenda.  If you have 
any questions or suggestions in advance of the meeting, do not hesitate to 
contact me of Jeff Keeler.

We look forward to your participation.

Deskheads:

I would like to have a 2 hour team building session for the assistants, 
receptionists, and clerks on Friday 5/25/01.  The only thing that will be 
charged to your cost center is the cost of a lunch brought in for the 
administrative staff.  

I know that the assistants usually are out of here between 12:30 to 1:30 
being that this is a Friday before a holiday.   I would like to have the 
session start at 12:30 so that they can still be out of here by 2:30 that 
day.  This would require the phones being on solo pilot starting at 12:30.

Please respond with your approval, questions and/or comments as soon as time 
permits so I can set everything up this week.

Many thanks,
Ina Rangel

Hello everyone.

In December we decided to kill our planned offsite due to market volatility.  
Louise and I would like to get everyone together offsite, probably in late 
June (once Louise is back from holiday (just kidding)).  I think it's time to 
go have a little fun with the group driving Enron's success. 

I would like suggestions as to:

1)  Where to go.

2)  What should be the focus of the business meetings.

3)  Should we have business meetings or should we do something else (ie. 
climb a mountain)?  I'm not a strong bid on climbing a mountain. 

4)  And any other ideas you have.

In addition I would like to start having staff meetings about once a month.  
The first one will be Friday May 11th at 2:30 p.m.  Please add this to your 
schedule.  I have invited everyone who has P/L responsibility.  Portland, 
Calgary and Toronto will have to be on Video or Phone conference.    

Regards

John

To all,

I visited with Kam earlier today to revisit the positions in the SE book and 
we discovered the following:

City of Madison transport: transfer to Pete's book for 10/01 and forward
MGAF transport:  write down 2007-2020 position.  Loss of about $500K - Scott 
as we spoke, I'll take the blame
LRC/Stringray positions:  Kam to review and explain
Annuity:    Origination total of about 90K, net with 500 loss from above
Alagasco:   Tammi deal, Sonat Tier 2 position
Others:    As I explained to Kam, any gain from closing this book should be 
transferred for the
    account of Jared Kaiser
            Bank of America
           ABA 0011.....just kidding!  It comes from sitting by Sandra too 
long.

Kam - thanks for your help and let me know if you need my help.  As well, 
please reply if I have not covered all issues.


Regards,

Jared

Scott,

Thanks for the help with Dave Duran.  He wants to offer me a job, and he sent 
me to talk to Louise Kitchen today, which I did.  She told me that she wanted 
to check my references.  I was wondering if you would be willing to drop her 
a note on me.  She would probably put a lot more stock in your view than in 
most of the other guys I have worked with in EI and EBS.  Thanks, I 
appreciate it.

Steve

Western Spot Power Prices Sink Amid River Runoff, Mild Weather

     Portland, Oregon, May 16 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Western U.S.
peak spot power prices for delivery tomorrow plummeted as
hydroelectric operators were forced to generate power, traders
said.
     At the Mid-Columbia trading point in Washington, peak power
declined 38.4 percent from yesterday to a Bloomberg index of
$140.55 a megawatt hour, with executed trades between $135.00-
$150.00.
     "Run-off is increasing hydroelectric supplies," said one
Northwest trader.
     Traders said that smaller dams in the Portland area don't
have the capability to store excess water from mountain snowmelt,
so they have to generate power or spill water.
     "The weather is mild in the Northwest, causing snow melt to
run off into the reservoirs," said one Northwest trader.
     According to Weather Services Corp., of Lexington,
Massachusetts, temperatures in Portland, Oregon were expected to
reach 63 degrees Fahrenheit today, increasing tomorrow 2 degrees
to 65 degrees.
     At the California Oregon Border, day-ahead peak power sank
$106.67 to a Bloomberg index of $140.00. Traders completed trades
in the $135.00-$145.00 range.
     In the Pacific Northwest, federal power marketer Bonneville
Power Administration offered up to 200 megawatts of delivered
energy for tomorrow at the Dow Jones Mid-Columbia and California-
Oregon Border firm electricity index price.
     At the Palo Verde switchyard in Arizona, peak power slipped
$72.20, to a Bloomberg index of $150.92 as traders executed
transactions in the $140.50-$150.00 range. Traders said they sold
off-peak power as low as $21.00 and as high as $40.00.
     Traders said that Arizona Public Service Co.'s 1,270-
megawatt Palo Verde 1 nuclear plant in Wintersburg, Arizona,
increased production 20 percent from yesterday to 70 percent of
capacity following the completion of a scheduled refueling outage
that began March 31.
     At the SP-15 delivery point in Southern California, peak
power slumped $73.33 to a Bloomberg index of $139.67 amid trades
in the $135.00-$145.00 range.

Northeast Spot Power Prices Steady Amid Idle Market Conditions

     Philadelphia, May 16 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Spot power prices
in the Northeast U.S. were little changed this morning, amid
expectations for continued increases in available generation and
stagnant cooling loads, traders said.
     According to Weather Derivatives Corp. of Belton, Missouri,
temperatures in the Northeast will average within one degree
Fahrenheit of normal over the next seven days, keeping heating and
cooling demands 89 and 97 percent below normal, respectively.
     In the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection, peak
power scheduled for Thursday delivery was assessed 65 cents
higher, at a Bloomberg volume-weighted index of $33.80 per
megawatt hour.
     Traders said tomorrow's projected load requirements and
generation outages were virtually unchanged, leaving little room
for movement in the day-ahead market.
     The Interconnection projected loads for the first six on-peak
hours of tomorrow to average just 100 megawatts greater than
today, and increases in available generation were estimated at
only 23 megawatts.
     The next-week market was volatile however, as revised weather
forecasts, calling for cooler temperatures, left many marketers
scrambling to readjust positions.
     "The weather forecast for next-week has been drastically
revised," said one PJM-based trader. "Anyone holding excess power
for that period was looking to unload it this morning, and the
market just fell out of bed from there."
     Traders said early morning trades topped out at $48.00,
before trailing off to lows in the $40.00-$41.00 range.
     In the New England Power Pool, day-ahead power sold 25 cents
lower amid trades in the $51.50-$52.50 range, with most deals
executed at $52.00.
     Entergy Corp. said it began the process of restarting its
670-megawatt Pilgrim 1 nuclear reactor at 3:07 a.m., although
traders agreed the additional megawatts didn't affect tomorrow's
market.
     "It's not a very big unit, so a minimal increase in
production isn't going to make a noticeable difference," said one
Northeast trader. "I'm sure it will be reflected in tomorrow's
day-ahead market, when output will be closer to capacity."
     Next-week packages traded heavily in New England, as they did
in PJM, though prices for the 5-day block there remained firm at
$55.00. Traders said heavy purchases from one of the region's load
serving entities might have helped support the market, by
offsetting forecasts for cooler temperatures.
     Temperatures in Boston, one of New England's primary load

Southeast Demand Again Drives Mid-Continent Power Prices Up

     Cincinnati, May 16 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Continued high
weather-related demand from the Southeast and a combination of
unit outages and transmission problems in the Midwest drove Mid-
Continent peak power prices up again today, traders said.
     East Central Area Reliability Council prices rose for the
fourth consecutive day as heavy weather-related demand from the
Tennessee Valley Authority grid continued, traders said.
     The Bloomberg index price for day-ahead power delivered into
the Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system rose $6.11
to $46.25 a megawatt-hour and has gained almost $19.00 this week.
Trades ranged from $44.50 up to $50.00 after options expiration.
     Cinergy traders said the late price rise came as marketers
oversold to TVA and had to buy power back from there to cover
short positions.
     In contrast to the daily market, short-term over-the-counter
prices dropped, with power for Friday delivery offered $2.00 less
than yesterday's price for Thursday-Friday parcels at $41.00 and
power for delivery from May 21-25 offered $7.00 less at $40.50.
     "There's a new weather forecast out, and it's going to be a
lot cooler next week now than we originally thought," one trader
said. "I wish I'd sold myself way short on the next week package
yesterday, but what can you do?"
     In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, peak power at
the Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison hub sold $2.46 higher on
average at $40.00-$46.00 and power in the lower half of the
region $2.79 higher on average at $46.00-$52.00.
     MAIN traders said transmission constraints all but
eliminated the ability to sell power west into the Mid-Continent
Area Power Pool, causing market focus to shift to the South and
East.
     With several unit outages and transmission problems,
continued hot weather and imports from MAIN unavailable, day-
ahead power prices in MAPP were the highest in the region again
today, traders said.
     Next-day power sold $1.00 higher on average in northern MAPP
at $50.00-$55.00 and 33 cents higher in the southern half of the
region at $50.00-$55.00. Traders said activity was limited, as
most utilities had no excess power available.
     "It's still in the 80s (degrees) here, which is much hotter
than we're used to this early in the year," one trader said. "Add
to that these unit outages, and you get what we have right now; a
pretty big mess."

Southeast Power Prices Mixed as Recent Heat Moderates

     Atlanta, May 16 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Southeast spot
electricity prices were mixed today as several major regional
population centers expected cooler weather tomorrow, while
others expected weather to remain hot, utility traders said.
     The Bloomberg Southeast Electric Reliability Council
regional index price rose an average of 39 cents a megawatt-
hour from equivalent trades made yesterday for delivery today,
to $47.77, amid trades in the $36.50-$60.00 range.
     Forecasters from Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather
Services Corp. predicted daily high temperatures in the Atlanta
vicinity would peak tomorrow at 87 degrees Fahrenheit,
unchanged from today's projected high.
     In sections of the Southwest Power Pool, tomorrow's
projected highs for Topeka, Kansas, were expected to decline to
the high-70s to low-80s tomorrow, utility traders said.
     "There was not a lot of trading done in the next-day
markets because we expect to see a break in the weather," said
one SPP-based utility trader. "Our temperatures, which are
expected to hit the 92-94 degree mark today, will decline to
about 10 degrees below normal tomorrow."
     According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives
Inc., cooling demand across the Southeast was expected to
average about normal over the next week.
     Over the next 6-10 days, temperatures in the Southeast are
expected to average 3.1 degrees below normal, the forecaster
said.
     On the Tennessee Valley Authority grid, power for tomorrow
traded in a "broad" range of $40.00-$53.00, though the majority
of energy trades were reported at a Bloomberg index of $44.57,
24 cents more than yesterday.
     Expectations for continued warm weather on the U.S. Gulf
Coast and troubling transmission line loading relief measures
between sections of southern Mid-Continent Area Power Pool and
the northern SPP, kept Entergy Corp. prices from falling,
traders said.
     The Bloomberg day-ahead peak Entergy index fell 2 cents
from yesterday to $49.73 amid trades in the $45.00-$55.00
range.
     Traders said prices could dip tomorrow in the Gulf Coast
region because natural gas futures for June delivery on the New
York Mercantile Exchange were slipping. June futures declined
28.3 cents per million British thermal units to $4.38 per
million Btu.

U.K. Winter Power Contracts Little Changed in Heavy Trade

     London, May 16 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Winter 2001 power prices
in the U.K. closed little changed today, although the contract was
unusually active, traders said.
     Winter 2001 baseload was last assessed 10 pence lower at
21.30-21.40 pounds a megawatt-hour.
     Although Winter 2001 traded over 60 times, one trader said
the contract traded "range-bound'' throughout the day, as
participants purchased and sold the contract in an effort to
create liquidity in the market.
     "Its unprecedented for over 800 megawatts to have traded and
we've seen little change. It's evident a player out there is very
keen to get liquidity going in the market,'' another trader said.
     Traders said the two major trading houses that have been
trading the contract aggressively over the past week were the main
market participants again today.
     Day-ahead prices tumbled today even though reports of outage
problems persisted, traders said.
     British Energy's Sizewell B nuclear plant was reported to
have shut for maintenance last Friday because of an acid leak,
although this couldn't be confirmed.
     "The spot market continued to be volatile. We are still
seeing a lot of panic buying and selling,'' one trader said. "It
seems people must have overbought in preparation for these planned
outages and now need to sell.''
     Day-ahead baseload started trade at 23.50 pounds a megawatt-
hour, before plummeting to trade at 18.00 pounds a megawatt-hour,
5.00 pounds lower than yesterday.

Nordic Electricity Prices Close Higher on Elevated Spot Value

     Lysaker, Norway, May 16 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Electricity
prices on the Nordic Power Exchange in Lysaker, Norway, rose in
active afternoon trade after generators set tomorrow's spot price
above expectations, traders said.
Participants rushed to close positions ahead of a Norwegian
holiday tomorrow that will keep the market closed. Nordpool is
scheduled to re-open on Friday.
     Winter-2, 2001 jumped 1.75 kroner a megawatt-hour to close at
a record high of 218.25 kroner a megawatt-hour with 449.00
megawatts exchanged. Winter-1, 2002 gained 2.10 kroner after
166.00 megawatts traded between 216.00-218.75 kroner a megawatt-
hour.
     Although industrial end-user demand was anticipated to drop
tomorrow as Norway celebrates Constitution Day, Thursday's system
area average price was set at 195.41 kroner a megawatt-hour, more
than 10 kroner above traders' expectations of 185.00 kroner a
megawatt-hour and down 2.97 kroner from today's price.
     Producers in western Norway retained control over inflowing
molten snow, pushing prices higher, an Oslo-based trader said. The
minimum hourly spot price in Trondheim, Norway was set at 190.88
kroner a megawatt-hour, only 4.53 kroner lower than the system
area average price.
     Nordpool reported an expected 2.5 percent increase in
Norwegian reservoirs to 34.7 percent of total capacity at the end
of week 19 from the previous week, compared to 49.9 percent of
total capacity a year ago. In Sweden, reservoirs were up 7.9
percent to 33.2 percent of total capacity, beating expectations of
a 5.2 percent gain.
     Snowmelt in Norway was likely to peak in the next ten days,
delaying water tank refilling, while in Sweden it peaked last
week, traders said.
     Limited snow accumulation in the important hydro-producing
region of western Norway has also minimized the effect of
anticipated supply increases.
     In the shorter-term, week 21 closed 1.50 kroner higher at
195.00 kroner a megawatt-hour after a total 286.00 megawatts
traded as low as 190.75 kroner a megawatt-hour. Week 22 jumped
5.00 kroner a megawatt-hour to 204.00 kroner a megawatt-hour.
     Total volumes more-than-quadrupled in afternoon trade to
3,717 gigawatt-hours generation compared to this morning's 738
gigawatt-hours.

fyi
This "banked" gas can't be recovered. It's Koch's gas now and they purchase 
from Devon at reduced price....

Victor,

I wanted to keep you in the loop of an issue on Gulf South.  I watch these 
wellheads very closely and still have managed to accumulate penalty gas on 
meter 2848 for May.  I spoke with Victor Haley to alert him as soon as I 
discovered this issue and he was looking into it.  The wellhead is flowing 
nearly twice as much as normal.  Victor H. was checking to see if another 
wellhead has been added at that point.  He still does not have any further 
information on that meter.  He is aware of it, does not seem to be too 
concerned, and has a copy of the spreadsheet attached.  You will see his 
original nom request as 2400 and I moved it up accordingly.  

Let me know if you want to discuss this any further.

Thanks!

Western Spot Power Prices Stable to Higher on Southwest Heat

     Phoenix, May 15 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Western U.S. peak spot
power prices for delivery tomorrow increased on weather-related
demand in the Southwest.
     Traders also said that higher natural gas values were keeping
a floor beneath Southwest power prices. Natural gas for June
delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose as high as
$4.635 per British thermal, 24.1 cents higher from yesterday's
close.
At the SP-15 delivery point in Southern California, peak
power gained $8 to a Bloomberg index of $213 a megawatt-hour, amid
trades in the $205-$220 range.
     Traders said that Arizona's Public Service Co. 1,270-megawatt
Palo Verde-1 nuclear plant in Wintersburg, Arizona, increased
production to 50 percent of capacity following the completion of a
scheduled refueling outage that began March 31.
     At the Palo Verde switchyard in Arizona, peak power rose
$2.64, to a Bloomberg index of $223.13 as traders executed
transactions in the $212.50-$250.00 range.
According to Weather Services Corp., of Lexington
Massachusetts, temperatures in Phoenix were expected to reach 101
degrees Fahrenheit today, increasing tomorrow 4 degrees to 105
degrees.
     At the California Oregon Border, peak power increased $44.34
from yesterday. Traders completed trades in the $240.00-$250.00
range.
     "Power prices are rising as energy traders are being bullish
in today's market,'' said one Northwest trader.
     At the Mid-Columbia trading point in Washington, peak power
rose $31.03 to a Bloomberg index of $236.43, with trades at
$235.00-$250.00.

PJM Spot Prices Rise on Cinergy Jump, Forwards on Natural Gas

     Philadelphia, May 15 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Spot values for
peak power delivered to the Western Hub of the Pennsylvania-New
Jersey-Maryland Interconnection rose in sympathy with climbing
day-ahead prices at the Ohio-based Cinergy Hub, traders said.
     For-Wednesday power was assessed at a Bloomberg volume-
weighted index of $38.15 per megawatt hour, up $2.18 from
yesterday. Traders said the market opened with sales at $40.00,
then tapered off to lows of $36.50 in post daily options activity.
     "It's got to be a knee jerk reaction to what's going on in
the [Mid]-West because generation is actually supposed to improve
tomorrow, and loads are supposed to come in a touch lower," one
PJM-based trader said of the higher prices.
     According to the Interconnection's Forecasted Generation
Outage Report, the pool will see a 25 percent increase in its
available supply tomorrow, bringing the total amount of off-line
generation down to 6,687 megawatts.
     In the over-the-counter market, short-term forwards moved
higher on anticpated cooling loads, while longer-term contracts
jumped in tandem with rising natural gas futures. Balance-of-the-
month and July-August packages were discussed $4.00 higher at
$47.00-$48.50 and $95.75-$98.00, respectively.
     June Henry Hub natural gas futures on the New York Mercantile
Exchange reached a ten-day high this morning, on forecasts for
above-normal temperatures in the Southwest U.S. As of 2 p.m. local
time, June futures peaked at $4.635 per million British thermal
units.
     While the contract rose as much as 24.1 cents, its intra-day
high remains 48.08 cents below the three-month historical average,
and 56.39 cents below the six-month average.
     In New England Power Pool, next day values rose $4.80 to an
index price of $52.25. Traders said planned line maintenance on
the tie line, which transmits hydroelectric generation from Hydro
Quebec, limited today's imports and would continue to do so
through Friday.

Mid-Continent Power Prices Climb on Southern, Midwestern Demand

     Cincinnati, May 15 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Mid-Continent
peak next-day power prices climbed again today as high weather-
related demand from the South and Midwest continued, traders
said.
     East Central Area Reliability Council traders said surplus
power available as a result of mild local weather and returning
generation continued to flow into the higher-priced Tennessee
Valley Authority grid.
     The Bloomberg index price for peak parcels delivered
Wednesday into the Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission
system rose $8.97 to $40.14 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging
from $38.00 up to $42.00 before options expiration.
     Next-day power in TVA sold $9.89 higher on average at
$36.50-$46.00, with temperatures in Nashville, Tennessee,
forecast from 88-90 degrees Fahrenheit through Friday.
     Short-term over-the-counter prices at the Cinergy hub also
rose, as demand from the Southeast was expected to continue
through the end of the week. Power for Thursday-Friday delivery
traded as high as $45.00, up from $39.50 yesterday.
     In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, continued
demand from Cinergy and a resumption of exports to the west drove
day-ahead energy prices up at the Chicago-based Commonwealth
Edison hub again today, traders said.
     Power sold $10.04 higher on average at ComEd, trading at
$36.00-$44.00 and as high as $48.00 in the local utility market.
In the lower half of the region, spot power traded at $42.00-
$51.00, up $9.88 on demand from the south and west.
     Mid-Continent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices were
the highest in the region today, with temperatures well above
normal and transmission problems causing a premium to be added to
imported power, traders said.
     Next-day power sold $4.50 higher on average in northern MAPP
at $48.00-$55.00 and $5.61 higher on average in the southern half
of the region at $50.00-$58.00.
     In its seven-day forecast, Belton, Missouri-based Weather
Derivatives Inc. predicted high temperatures would average 6
degrees above normal in Minneapolis, with cooling demand levels
133 percent above normal.
     "Some people's load forecasts were low, and they needed to
adjust today, so when hourlies jumped the dailies followed," one
MAPP trader said. "Also, we're as high as we are because a lot of
units are still off and transmission's a mess, so the market's
just going to butt up against gas prices."

Southeast Power Prices Jump as Southern Markets Stay Hot

     Atlanta, May 15 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Southeast spot
electricity prices were higher today as recent warm weather
failed to moderate as predicted, traders said.
     Forecasters from Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather
Services Corp. predicted daily high temperatures in the Atlanta
vicinity would peak tomorrow at 87 degrees Fahrenheit, 1 degree
higher than today's projected high. Yesterday, forecasters said
they expected cooler weather in Atlanta to begin tomorrow.
     Traders said Southern Co. was still a net buyer of spot
power in the $47.00 a megawatt-hour range, despite increased
power production from its recently restarted Farley Unit 2
reactor. The unit emerged from a planned refuel May 8, and was
operating at 99 percent of capacity early today.
      The Bloomberg Southeast Electric Reliability Council
regional index price rose $10.03 a megawatt-hour from
equivalent trades made yesterday for delivery today, to $47.38.
Trades ranged from $34.50-$60.00.
     In Maryland, Constellation Energy' Group Inc's 850-
megawatt Calvert Cliffs Unit 2 reactor was reported at 55
percent of capacity early today, following the completion of
refueling operations on March 15.
     "It's going to be fairly warm in our service territory
over the balance of the week," said one Tennessee Valley
Authority trader. "We heard a few key players were deciding to
sell into the hourly markets tomorrow, which could keep the
day-ahead prices up."
     On the TVA grid, day-ahead prices began trade as low as
$36.50 although most trades were much higher as buyers emerged
to cover unforeseen air-cooling demand. The Bloomberg into-TVA
peak index price rose an average of $9.89 to $44.33, amid
trades in the $36.50-$46.00 range.
     Traders said early today that demand was highest on the
TVA grid. Later in the day traders said that most power was
flowing through the TVA grid to get to markets on the Southern
Co. grid, where demand was expected to be higher.
     Power sold into the Southern grid at a Bloomberg average
of $47.00, up $10.00 from yesterday amid trades in the $46.00-
$47.00 range.
     In Texas, traders reported light trading despite
yesterday's completion of Texas Utility's 345 kilovolt south-
to-north flowing Limestone-Watermill transmission line. Traders
said line capacity would increase from about 900 megawatts
daily to more than 2,000 megawatts.
     The Bloomberg firm "UB" power price for unit or
transmission contingent supply, rose $2.25 to $47.50, mostly on
rising natural gas prices, traders said.
     By mid-afternoon, the June natural gas futures contract on
the New York Mercantile Exchange had risen as much as 25.6
cents per million British thermal units to $4.650 per million
Btu. Gulf Coast day-ahead gas prices rose about 18 cents to
$4.37-$4.43, Bloomberg spot market surveys found.
     Traders said recent hot weather in the West and South had
caused the run up in natural gas values, despite expectations
for higher-than-usual injections into underground storage.

U.K. Day-ahead Power Contract Prices Rise on Outage Concerns

     London, May 15 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices for
delivery tomorrow climbed on reports of a possible nuclear plant
outage, traders said.
     Day-ahead baseload power started trade at 20.00 pounds a
megawatt-hour before rising to 23.00 pounds a megawatt-hour, 4.25
pounds higher than prices for today.
     Rumors of an outage at a Magnox nuclear plant pulled prices
higher as participants bought the day-ahead contract in an effort
to secure supply, traders said.
     Week 21 rose amid active buying interest ahead of several
planned maintenance outages next week, traders said.
     The contract traded in a range of 18.25-18.80 pounds a
megawatt-hour, before last trading at 18.65 pounds a megawatt-
hour, 45 pence higher than yesterday's close.
     Moreover, forecasts for lower temperatures also pushed prices
higher amid expectations for higher heating requirements, traders
said.
     Across the U.K. temperatures were forecast to average around
8-15 degrees Celsius today, falling to 6-13 degrees tomorrow,
according to the Weather Services Corp. in the U.S.
     June baseload traded 30 pence higher at 18.53 pounds a
megawatt-hour. July baseload traded 25 pence higher at 18.40
pounds a megawatt-hour.

Short-Term Nordic Power Surges on Unexpectedly High Spot Price

     Lysaker, Norway, May 15 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Short-term
electricity prices on the Nordic Power Exchange in Lysaker,
Norway, surged in afternoon trade after the publication of a
higher-than-expected system area average price for tomorrow,
traders said.
     With 475 megawatts traded, week-21 jumped 4.50 Norwegian
kroner to close at 193.50 kroner a megawatt-hour after falling as
much as 3.00 kroner to 186.00 kroner a megawatt-hour before the
spot price was announced. Week-23 registered the largest gain
today, closing at 204.00 kroner a megawatt-hour, up 6.50 kroner.
     Wednesday's spot price averaged 198.38 kroner a megawatt-
hour, up 12.68 kroner from today's price, compared to estimates of
180.00-185.00 kroner a megawatt-hour. Below-average snow
accumulation and snowmelt this year are curbing hydro-production,
traders said.
     In western Denmark, the maximum hourly spot price for
Wednesday was set at 595.25 kroner a megawatt-hour, 345.60 kroner
higher than a maximum of 249.65 kroner a megawatt-hour for the
exchange area because snowmelt inflow into Danish rivers was
decreasing, dwarfing supply, an Oslo-based trader said.
     In Trondheim, Norway, hourly spot prices averaged 216.12
kroner a megawatt-hour, 17.74 kroner higher than the system area
average price following power transmission restrictions from
eastern Norway where snowmelt was reported to be more abundant, a
Bergen, Norway-based trader said.
     Producers in eastern Norway will let reservoirs overflow
without generating electricity because of accelerated melting
while larger western producers will have better control over
output with empty dams and little snow.
     Even though water tank flooding forces some generators to
sell power at lower prices instead of letting water overspill with
no economic gain, others are unable to contain spillage at the
peak of the snowmelt season.
     Colder weather next week was also expected to boost end-user
demand for space heating, pushing prices higher. Traders continued
to downplay expectations of wet weather following recent over-
estimation of rainfall.
     Longer-term contracts also rose. Winter-2 2001 closed at a
high of 216.50 kroner a megawatt-hour, up 2.00 kroner from
yesterday after 459.00 megawatts traded. Winter-1 2002 gained 2.65
kroner to 216.65 kroner a megawatt-hour.
     Nordpool's total trade volumes amounted to 3,622 gigawatt-
hours generation today compared to 5,469 gigawatt-hours yesterday.

Sabra,

I have extended the current FP&L sitara #217969 to the end of the deal 
(2/2010).

Keeping the same deal # helps us keep up with the value.

I set it up with the volumes we booked in TAGG, I know the volumes and 
locations will change but if you could send me and Yuan an e-mail when you 
have made your change during bid week we will make the changes to the hedge 
deal.


Thanks,

Kam


ps.  Scott, you will not see any problems with this deal in the future.  
Sorry for the trouble.

Joann ---

Effective 5/1/01 through 10/31/01 we have a 10,000 MMBtu/d index put at 
Dominion South Point to PSEG.  We can do as much as we want in any month, 
within the 0-10,000 MMBtu/d parameters, but we can do no more than 920,000 
MMBtu for the whole term.  We need to keep a running tally of how much we 
use.  Starting on Monday, can we keep this tally on the morning sheet and 
update it daily?

Scott

Hello everyone!
Just wanted to send a quick note to let those of you who don't know already 
that I will be moving into a new position within the next week or so and will 
no longer be the Reporting Contact for the Natural Gas Teams.  I am moving 
over to manage the Reporting Groups for the Back Office and Group Teams.  
Please welcome Laynie East as my replacement.  She can be reached at X3-3131 
and you may begin calling her with any Natural Gas Team related needs 
immediately.
I will certainly be assisting in the transition process and will assist her 
with any of your requests on an as needed basis for a while.  Please forward 
this note to anyone in your groups who may need this information.

It has been a pleasure working with each of you over the last several months.

Thanks,
Edie

Scott,
I overheard you talking about NY City studies earlier.  The two files 
attached were work in progress that I although not completed and a little 
rough I thought may be useful in their current form.  I am working with 
Sabina Rank to take over and complete all of my projects and daily 
fundamentals duties.
Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks,
Sean

Subject: Structure for Storage Loans / Deferred Payment Deals


The memo attached summarizes a structured deal that the market has shown some 
interest.  

Essentially, this deal allows an LDC to defer payment for gas and avoid 
carrying costs (which may result in a dollar for dollar benefit to your 
customer's bottom line).  

We have done two of these deals to date.  ENA has interest in additional 
deals (albeit not an infinite appetite) if the structure allows us to move 
them off the balance sheet.

Please review the memo and target any of your customers that may have an 
interest.  

Each deal will require a new quote from credit and from the cost of funds 
group.  Gas structuring is set up to structure these deals and develop them 
through to execution.  

Please call me with any questions at x36751

    By Timothy Gardner
    NEW YORK, May 3 (Reuters) - Adding stress to an already
frazzled power market, a nationwide coal shortage could spawn
electricity brownouts in northeastern states and in the West
this summer, experts said on Thursday.
    While coal provides the country with 51 percent of its
power, years of industry underinvestment and record prices for
competing fuels natural gas and fuel oil this year have pushed
utilities' coal stocks to their lowest levels since 1974.
    In January, the last month of available government data,
stocks at electric plants were 94 million tons, 27 percent less
than a year earlier, according to the Energy Information
Administration, the Department of Energy's number cruncher.
    Thin coal stocks compound a U.S. natural gas shortage that
led to rolling brownouts in California last winter. That came
after a failed deregulation plan and amid natural gas infrastructure
bottlenecks. Natural gas prices have fallen
from last summer's all-time highs, but are still nearly twice
what they were last year at this time.
    "In certain regions we would expect brownouts this summer,"
said Deck Sloan, spokesman for Arch Coal Inc. <ACI.N>, the
nation's second largest coal firm. "In California that seems to
be a very high likelihood, especially given the situation with
reservoir levels behind the hydro-dams in the West," he said.
    Los Angeles has avoided brownouts, largely because it has a
coal cache in Utah. L.A.'s power department is the largest
participant in the 1,600 megawatt (MW) Intermountain Power
Project in Utah. The project supplies L.A. with 14 percent of
its power and lesser amounts to nearby cities Anaheim and
Pasadena as well as parts of Utah.
    One megawatt powers about 1,000 homes.
    Mike Nosanov, the operating agent of the 1,600 MW
Intermountain project, said the plant now has 700,000 tons of
coal, or 60 days supply. "That's more than enough to keep us
out of trouble this summer," he said.  Still, L.A. mayor
Richard Riordan has been meeting with Utah Governor Mike
Leavitt to discuss adding another 500 to 1,000 MW to the Utah
plant, though it would take years to add the capacity.

    OVERLOADED RAILROAD
    Another potential problem is stemming from the nation's
largest coal producing state, Wyoming, which delivers coal to
24 states.
    The two major railroads at Wyoming's Powder River Basin,
Union Pacific and Burlington Northern Santa Fe, operate a joint
line out of the mines that has reached its capacity of 64
trains per day or more than 300 million tons per year.
    "The two lines could probably carry another 10 to 20
million tons (per year) out of Wyoming's Powder River Basin.
Beyond that it may take additional investment by the railroads
in order to get more production out of the basin," said Sloan.
    The Midwest is also thirsty for Wyoming coal. A proposal to
build a $1.4 billion coal rail project from Wyoming to power
plants in the Midwest is in the works.
    Hill and Associates, an independent industry consulting
firm, agrees that Wyoming coal trains are at their limits, a
problem that will take years to solve. "The question is who is
going to make the investment?" asked Hill and Associates Vice
President John Hanou. "The mines or the railroads?"

    COAL DROUGHT ALL OVER
    Northeastern states, where years of production
underinvestment has led to thin stocks, are also in danger,
said Arch Coal's Sloan. "We could also see the Northeast, if
the summer is normal or hotter than normal, suffer brownouts as
well," he said.
    Adding to the mix, Massey Energy <MEE.N>, the nation's
seventh-largest coal company, experienced flooding last month
in one of its major mines in Appalachia.
    "In this current atmosphere, that is a hell of a big story,
said Jim Thompson, general manager of Energy Publishing, a Hill
and Associates affiliate.
    And the EIA reported utilities so far this year are burning
six percent more coal than last year. Prices on the spot market
have jumped, though long-term contracts make up 80 percent of
coal deals, which mean consumers will mostly be protected from
rising prices.
    But utilities may find themselves scrambling for coal. "As
far as we can tell there is no coal available anywhere," warned
a Hill and Associates supply report this spring.
    "Brownouts are possible," said Lehman Brothers coal analyst
Peter Ward. "Utilities have gotten complacent. Coal has been a
buyer's market for about two decades. That has suddenly changed
in the past three months, and for many utilities with low
inventories, that is a scary situation."
    Analysts said high coal prices should eventually spur
increased production of the fuel, and new natural gas and coal
plants will eventually clear up brownout threats. "But we're
not going to see much capacity come on line for at least three
years," said Hanou.

Northwest Spot Electricity Prices Rise With Reduced Snowmelt

     Portland, Oregon, May 17 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Peak spot
power prices for Friday-Saturday delivery in the Pacific
Northwest increased as less snowmelt and river runoff was
available for hydroelectric generation, traders said.
     A Bloomberg report shows accumulated precipitation in the
Western U.S. at 30.33 percent below typical levels and the snow
water equivalent for the region at 64.25 percent below average.
     At the Mid-Columbia trading point in Washington, the
Bloomberg index increased $24.82 from yesterday to $153.60 a
megawatt hour, with trades executed between $145.00-$160.00.
     "The rain has stopped in the Northwest, and unlike the
snowmelt and the river run-off we had yesterday, it's beginning
to slow down,'' said one Northwest trader.
     At the California Oregon Border, day-ahead peak power gained
$22.60 to a Bloomberg index of $162.60, selling in a range of
$160.00-$166.00.
     According to Weather Services Corp. of Lexington,
Massachusetts, temperatures in Astoria, Oregon, were expected to
reach 57 degrees Fahrenheit today, increasing tomorrow 2 degrees
to 59 degrees.
     "Northwest power prices are also rising with (the) Colstrip
unit down,'' said one Northwest marketer.
     Pennsylvania Power and Light Co.'s 700-megawatt Colstrip-3
coal-fired plant located in Colstrip, Montana, shut yesterday for
unplanned maintenance and is expected to restart tomorrow.
      At the NP-15 delivery point, peak power traded at $160.00-
$165.00, rising $9.79.
     Traders said power prices will likely increase over the next
few days as snowmelt continues to lessen and higher temperatures
are expected.
     According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives
Inc., temperatures are expected to average 4.4 degrees Fahrenheit
above normal in the Pacific Northwest and 2.7 degrees above
normal in the Southwest 6-10 days from now.

Most Northeast Spot Power Prices Remain Steady With Low Demand

     Philadelphia, May 17 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Values for next-
day delivery of peak power remained little changed throughout most
of the Northeast U.S. as moderate temperatures continue to curb
regional load requirements, traders said.
     In the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection, peak
power scheduled for Friday delivery was assessed at a Bloomberg
volume-weighted index of $39.40 per megawatt hour, up only 60
cents from yesterday.
     "This is the annual calm before the storm," said one PJM-
based trader. "Prices are right where they should be for this time
of year, barring any unforeseen unit outages or sustained heat
waves, of course."
     Power scheduled for Friday delivery during this week last
year was valued at $36.50, representing an 8.2 percent departure
from today's comparative index.
     In the over-the-counter market, expectations for increased
supply and scant cooling demand further eroded next-week prices.
The five-day package was discussed at $38.29-39.25, compared to
$42.50-$43 yesterday.
     According to Weather Derivatives Corp. of Belton, Missouri,
temperatures in the Northeast will average 1.1 degree Fahrenheit
below normal May 21-May 25.
     Day-ahead values in the New England Power Pool were also
little changed at an index price of $51.50. Traders cited heavy
volume in the $51.50-$52.00 range, with an intra-day low and high
of $49.75 and $53.00, respectively.
     Next-week packages remained steady as well, as scheduled line
maintenance offset price reactions to the anticipated restart of
Entergy Corp.'s Pilgrim 1 nuclear unit.
     Data from the Independent System Operator of New England
shows the Alps-New Scotland transmission line that transmits power
to and from New York will be shut May 21-May 24 for breaker
repairs.
     New York was the Northeast's anomaly, with next-day values
trading higher across all three zones because of unit outages.
Zone A jumped $4.25 to an index of $43.00, while Zones G and J
posted increases of $3.25 and $2.13, respectively, to $54.00 and
$58.13 indices.
     Niagara Mohawk's 1,148-megawatt Nine Mile Point 2 nuclear
unit shut automatically yesterday due to a turbine trip. The
company is investigating the cause and hasn't released an expected
restart date.
     Mirant Corp. also lost a unit unexpectedly, its 447-megawatt
Tomkins Cove plant, following a boiler explosion. The plant is
located 25 miles north of New York City and is fueled by coal,
natural gas and oil. Company officials told Bloomberg the unit
will remain in shutdown until the cause of the explosion has been
determined.

ECAR Power Prices Fall as Squeeze Ends; MAIN, MAPP Also Drop

     Cincinnati, May 16 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Mid-Continent
next-day power prices declined as traders finished covering short
sales in the East Central Area Reliability Council and cooler
weather moved into the Midwest, traders said.
     ECAR traders said prices fell across the region as the
Cinergy hub market returned to levels seen before yesterday's
"short squeeze," where many market participants had to buy power
to fulfill requirements from prior sales.
     The Bloomberg index price for power delivered Friday into
the Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system fell $6.29
to $39.96 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $42.00 down
to $38.00 after options expiration.
     "There was still plenty of volume, and plenty of demand from
the South," one ECAR trader said. "The drop was just a return to
more fundamentally-based prices after yesterday's short squeeze
went as far as it could go."
     Over-the-counter prices at Cinergy continued to decline
after a bearish injection report from the American Gas
Association drove natural gas futures prices down further and
weather forecasts were revised cooler for next week.
     Peak Cinergy parcels for delivery from May 21-25 sold at
$35.00, down $5.00 from yesterday, while offers fell to $62.00
for June power and $95.00 for July-August parcels, the lowest
level seen this year.
     In the Mid-America Interconnected Network, day-ahead power
prices dropped as temperatures were expected to do the same, with
peak parcels selling $5.79 less on average at $36.00-$40.00 at
the Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison hub and $5.21 less on
average at $41.00-$47.00 in the lower half of the region.
     Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp.
predicted high temperatures in Chicago would fall from 84 degrees
Fahrenheit today to 75 degrees tomorrow.
     Mid-Continent Power Pool next-day electricity prices also
fell, as cooler weather reduced demand and lessened transmission
constraints, traders said.
     Peak power sold $7.00 less at $43.00-$46.00 in northern MAPP
and $6.94 less at $44.00-$48.00 in the southern half of the
region.
     Weather Services forecast tomorrow's high temperature in the
low-to-mid 70s degrees across MAPP, down from temperatures in
mid-80s to low-90s degrees earlier this week.

Most Southeast Power Prices Drop as Cooler Weather Dominates

     Topeka, Kansas, May 17 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S.
Southeast spot electricity prices were mostly lower today as
cooler weather was projected to move through the region
tomorrow, traders said.
     The Bloomberg Southeast Electric Reliability Council
regional index price fell an average of $2.30 a megawatt-hour,
or 4.8 percent from equivalent trades made yesterday for
delivery today, to $45.47, amid trades in the $36.00-$65.00
range.
     "We're going to have a 15 degree (Fahrenheit) temperatures
change from today to tomorrow if the forecasts are right," said
one Southwest Power Pool utility trader. "Because quite a few
units are coming back from maintenance, next week's really
going to soften up."
     Forecasters from Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather
Services Corp. predicted daily high temperatures in the Topeka
vicinity would peak tomorrow at 71 degrees Fahrenheit, off from
today's projected high of 84 degrees.
     In the Tennessee Valley, traders said expected high
temperatures will decline about 1-3 degrees through tomorrow,
cutting residential and commercial power demand for air
cooling.
     On the Tennessee Valley Authority grid, the Bloomberg peak
next-day index price slid $3.07 to $41.50 amid trades in the
$36.00-$44.00 range. Off-peak energy was discussed at $16-$18,
$2 higher on cooler expected overnight weather.
     Utility traders in the Virginia-Carolinas region said that
recent warm weather would continue through tomorrow and the
weekend, though temperatures would start out cooler through the
first half of next week.
     The Bloomberg VACAR index fell an average of $2.58 to
$45.55 amid trades at $45.00-$48.00.
     According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives
Inc., cooling demand across the Southeast was expected to
average about a half degree above normal over the next week,
though temperatures could average 4.1 degrees below normal over
the next 6-10 days.

U.K. Power Prices Little Changed in Lackluster Trade

     London, May 17 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices in the U.K.
were little changed today amid lethargic activity, traders said.
     June traded 10 pence higher at 18.45 pounds a megawatt-hour.
July traded 10 pence lower at 18.30 pounds a megawatt-hour.
     Activity was "directionless" today amid little new
information to trade on, traders said.
     Although many power plants have scheduled outages over the
coming months for maintenance, one trader said price gains were
offset by sufficient supply in the market.
     Winter 2001 baseload traded 15 pence higher than yesterday
following trades at 21.52 pounds a megawatt-hour.
     Day-ahead baseload started trade at 18.50 pounds a megawatt-
hour, 65 pence lower than yesterday.
     Day-ahead peak traded at 22.00 pounds a megawatt-hour, 40
pence lower than yesterday.

Nordic Electricity Prices Close Higher on Elevated Spot Value

     Lysaker, Norway, May 16 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Electricity
prices on the Nordic Power Exchange in Lysaker, Norway, rose in
active afternoon trade after generators set tomorrow's spot price
above expectations, traders said.
Participants rushed to close positions ahead of a Norwegian
holiday tomorrow that will keep the market closed. Nordpool is
scheduled to re-open on Friday.
     Winter-2, 2001 jumped 1.75 kroner a megawatt-hour to close at
a record high of 218.25 kroner a megawatt-hour with 449.00
megawatts exchanged. Winter-1, 2002 gained 2.10 kroner after
166.00 megawatts traded between 216.00-218.75 kroner a megawatt-
hour.
     Although industrial end-user demand was anticipated to drop
tomorrow as Norway celebrates Constitution Day, Thursday's system
area average price was set at 195.41 kroner a megawatt-hour, more
than 10 kroner above traders' expectations of 185.00 kroner a
megawatt-hour and down 2.97 kroner from today's price.
     Producers in western Norway retained control over inflowing
molten snow, pushing prices higher, an Oslo-based trader said. The
minimum hourly spot price in Trondheim, Norway was set at 190.88
kroner a megawatt-hour, only 4.53 kroner lower than the system
area average price.
     Nordpool reported an expected 2.5 percent increase in
Norwegian reservoirs to 34.7 percent of total capacity at the end
of week 19 from the previous week, compared to 49.9 percent of
total capacity a year ago. In Sweden, reservoirs were up 7.9
percent to 33.2 percent of total capacity, beating expectations of
a 5.2 percent gain.
     Snowmelt in Norway was likely to peak in the next ten days,
delaying water tank refilling, while in Sweden it peaked last
week, traders said.
     Limited snow accumulation in the important hydro-producing
region of western Norway has also minimized the effect of
anticipated supply increases.
     In the shorter-term, week 21 closed 1.50 kroner higher at
195.00 kroner a megawatt-hour after a total 286.00 megawatts
traded as low as 190.75 kroner a megawatt-hour. Week 22 jumped
5.00 kroner a megawatt-hour to 204.00 kroner a megawatt-hour.
     Total volumes more-than-quadrupled in afternoon trade to
3,717 gigawatt-hours generation compared to this morning's 738
gigawatt-hours.

Given the growth in EES it has become apparent that it is time to consolidate 
the risk functions between EES and EWS.  This will provide EES with the 
systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups 
necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market 
opportunities.

With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk 
groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing, 
structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and 
back-office services.  These groups main function is to provide these 
services to EES.  We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice 
President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the 
Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will 
continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice 
President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the 
Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim 
Belden.

These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while 
ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading 
organizations.

These changes are effective immediately.  Please congratulate Rogers and Don 
on their new roles.

Kam, last year when this deal was set up, I set up deal tickets extending 
into the future for 5 years (I would have extended it all the way to 2010 but 
the Risk people back then asked me not to).  I have a new ticket for each 
season since the volumes at each primary point and fuel change over the years 
and by season.  Extending Sitara 217969 through is going to be doubling 
volumes for one and secondly, it won't reflect the correct primary points for 
each season.  I would really like to be consulted about these kind of changes 
before they are made and maybe we and Scott Neal could sit down and figure 
out a better way to keep up with the value.  I'll run some facilitation 
reports and see if this has caused us any trouble that we may need to fix.

Thanks, Sabra

Sabra,

I have extended the current FP&L sitara #217969 to the end of the deal 
(2/2010).

Keeping the same deal # helps us keep up with the value.

I set it up with the volumes we booked in TAGG, I know the volumes and 
locations will change but if you could send me and Yuan an e-mail when you 
have made your change during bid week we will make the changes to the hedge 
deal.


Thanks,

Kam


ps.  Scott, you will not see any problems with this deal in the future.  
Sorry for the trouble.

Nelson,

I have booked the TDC deal for the remainder of the term.  It is now in the 
Gulf3 book at Tenn/Zone1.  If locations need to change, and I'm sure they 
will, please let me know and I will make sure it is hedged correctly.  

sitara #778201

also,  if you could use the same sitara number every month for the central 
gas it would help make our reconciliation process much smoother.


Thanks,

Kam

Scott,

Please see the message below from Neil Davies.  Neil works in HR under David 
Oxley and was instructed to call Mr. Reitze last night.  I asked him not to 
mention the dinner with you.  A problem that is coming up is that the 
interviews are required to run late (8:30ish) and the person that has been 
pushed to the end of that line is Hunter.  What are your thoughts on this and 
is him going to dinner with the two of you a possibility at all?  If you need 
me to help with reservations or anything, please let me know as I would be 
happy to help.

Also note that Greg Whalley would like to meet with him.  Eddie does not want 
to come in any earlier than 4.  That can be a problem.  Maybe another thought 
is to have him come in twice, but I am afraid if we pick that option, it may 
be tough to get him back.

Anyway, look over this message, tell me your thoughts and after I hear back 
from you, I will arrange the interview schedule for Eddie on the 23rd.

Kim

John/Kim/David

Just called - can come in on Weds 23rd ( reason why he can't come in earlier 
- vacation from 16th to 19th ) . Still interested in talking - simply a 
scheduling issue - don't seem to be any barriers to moving forward.

They have just moved office - hence new number (7139890962)

Does the 23rd work ?

I didn't mention the Scott Neal call.

Neil

Last year money was to be set aside in reserves to cover the net amount needed
to resolve these issues with Transco, BUG , LILCO and Enron.  The total 
dollars
required was approximately $4.25 million.  An amount of $3.55 million needed 
for 
the Transco historical imbalance resolution.  The remaining balance was needed
for the BUG and LILCO accounting issues that Keyspan brought to our attention 
last year.

Bob Hall has $3.5 million reserved in his area for the Transco historical 
imbalance.
The remaining $50,000 for Transco and approximately $700,000 of additional 
funds
for the accounting issues were to be reserved last year under "The Office of 
the
Chairman".  Sally Beck and Janet Dietrich arranged for this additional money 
to
be reserved at the "Chairman" level since the additional funds were needed to 
correct an old accounting problem that should not hit the East Desk P&L.  
Also, the 
arrangement was that the reserve would be maintained until the settlement 
payments
were made by Enron.

As with most stories, there is some good news and some bad news.  First, the 
bad news.
After a great deal of investigation, it appears that there currently is no 
reserve at the
"Office of the Chairman"  for these additional funds.  Now, the good news.  
Georgeanne 
will take the necessary steps to make sure there is money available so that 
we can
quickly resolve these issues with Keyspan and Transco.

If you have questions, please give me a call.
