Robin/Ron:  Must get rid of this sub-QSE language.  Please give me a shout 
asap to discuss.  Having these sub-QSE's is bad for EPMI for the following 
reasons: 

(1) sub-QSE's are settled as stand-alone QSE's and thus 
 - EPMI gets smaller deadband limits for each sub-QSE 
 - Wind deviations could not be covered with % deadband of other schedules 
(wind would have to be setup as its own sub-QSE)
 
(2) sub-QSE's significantly affect EPMI's ability to make profits by 
optimizing a portfolio of customers
 - EPMI is better off with one large QSE that it can share/balance among 
different schedules
 - Customers could request to be setup as a sub-QSE and it would be difficult 
for EPMI to optimize between customers and make profits.  We lose the  
ability of having a black box where customers can not see how we optimize our 
portfolio.

Thanks, - Mike

Steve, it looks like you can download the QSE application forms off the 
internet (see below).  Steve is going to coordinate the QSE application 
getting filled out and submitted to ERCOT.  Steve you should make sure to get 
sign-off on the application with Smith Day, Doug Gilbert-Smith, Mike Curry, a 
regulatory (Ron or Robin) and a legal person (Janet Moore) as well before it 
is submitted with ERCOT.  Thanks, - Mike

Thank you to everyone that attended the meeting on energy product definition
on Tuesday, May 7th at Tractebel's offices in Houston.  The objective of
this meeting was to define the initially offered energy product that will be
available for electronic matching transactions on the APX Trading Exchange
that will open June 1st in the ERCOT market. This objective was realized.

The first energy product that will be offered on the APX Trading Exchange is
defined as follows:

FIRM ENERGY/HOURLY (FEH)

* Supply or pay
* He who moves the power pays
* Marked one of four ways when posted:
* North Zone
* West Zone
* South Zone
* Any Zone
* Traded hourly
* Trading period extends out 72 hours from the end of the Adjustment
Period
* Trading period closes 15 minutes before the Operating Period

At the request of meeting participants, I am also including a definition for
a Firm Energy/Daily Product.  This definition might be considered as a
market standard definition for daily energy bilateral trading as of June
1st.  This product will not be offered on the APX Trading Exchange on June
1st but, with consensus, could be used for daily energy transactions between
market participants.

FIRM ENERGY/DAILY (FED)

* Supply or pay
* Seller's choice
* Sink pays congestion

I'm also attaching the Powerpoint slides that were used to kick-off the
brainstorming session during the meeting.  If I've missed any crucial
information, or any decisions that were made during the meeting, please
refresh my memory.  If you have any additional comments or feedback, please
contact me.

Thank you again for taking the time to work as a market team in developing a
strategy to create a vibrant and liquid market.  If you do not already have
desktop access to APX trading technology, please let me know and we will
provide you with additional information.

Guys, unfortunately, I think I'm going to have to bow out of our camping
trip this weekend. I have been rather ill over the last week and a half,
and
I'm not sure that I'm up for the elements and all of the alcohol that are
involved in this weekend's festivities. I have been hoping to get better,
but between work and my cold, I don't think I'm up for it. Have fun and
please try not to make too much fun of the "silent one" while you are in a
wood kicking frenzy.

I also have a small tent that can be borrowed if "the silent one" emerges
from the depths of the legal system to join us on our quest for physical
pain, inebriation, and large, uncontrollable fires.

After reading this I am wondering how we modeled Fronterra for testing.  

Anyone know?

See attached EMail from John Adams:

If this approach to Combined Cycle Plants (separate Resource ID's for each GT 
and ST) is of concern to you, please let your client rep  and John Adams 
know. This approach leads to multiple resource id's for plants that are in 
many cases managed at a plant level...not "unit" level as this approach 
implies. The burden to submit resource plans at the component level and the 
possibility of receiving a Unit Specific deployments, along with the 
proliferation of resource id's (many of these plants are owned by multiple 
entities...leading to even more resource id's) points out that different 
solution is needed. Greg Graham ggraham@lcra.org

Robert 

There has been considerable discussion and argument over the need of the 
security applications to have each unit described in the model uniquely to 
allow

the stability applications to work properly. 

Operations has argued strongly that every unit over a size (20 mw) has got to 
be modeled for the stability analysis modules to work.

I understand that every unit modeled in registration MUST have a 
corresponding ( one to one) entry in the network model.? 

As I understant it, this leads to the following chain where the symbol => 
means "requires" 

Operations needs all synchronous units > 20 MW? modeled & telemeter=> 
All units over 20 MW must be registered uniquely (elements of combined cycle 
plants registered uniquely)?? Consequence of Design

All units must be settled matching the registration database => 
??????? ??????? ??????? ??????? ??????? ??????? Consequence of Design

All resource plans must be submitted for each unit of a Combined Cycle unit 
=> 
Jointly owned Combined Cycle units must submit resource plan items for each 
owner of each unit of a Combined Cycle plant for each scheduling period =>

A combined cycle plant with 6 units and 3 owners results in 6 * 3 * 96 
entries per day. 

I understand many QSE's are balking at this requirement as burdensome and 
un-necessary. (LCRA, OXY,etc) 

We also have a problem with modeling of MANY MANY very small resources to get 
them into the settlement system. 

It occurs to me that the Operations Requirement is NOT that the individual 
units be settled separately, or scheduled separately.? Only that they be 
modeled separately and telemetered separately. 

Why can't we have a single entry in the settlement system map to many units 
in the network model, and conversely have many entries in the settlement 
system (many small units) map to a single, or even NO entry in the network 
model?

Why can't we break the link between unit registration and the network model?? 
or at least modify it?? Or do I mis-understand the situation?

Please let me know if my understanding of the situation is correct or correct 
me if I misunderstand.? I would appreciate suggestions on how to improve the 
situation.

As part of your preparation for the RUG meeting on Wednesday and Thursday,
please conduct an individual review of the Protocols Implementation Plan items
e-mailed by Vikki Gates on Sunday.  We will begin our review of the PIP on the
afternoon of the 6th .  In particular, the list below identifies PIP items 
that
require a review by RUG because of a potentially significant change in 
Protocol
language.

Item 103 - Default QSE
Item 107 - Uninstructed Deviation Tolerance Limit
Proposal by Floyd Trefny
Item 108 - Sub QSE (payment process, invoicing, and liability)
Proposal by C. Moseley
Item 109 - DC Tie (Oklaunion exclusion)
Proposal by Richard Ross
Item 120 - Local Balancing Energy Premium
Proposals by Don Blackburn and Manny Munoz
Item 126 - Plant vs. Resource Specific Output in OOME
Items 144 and 200 - LSE/QSE allocation of AS
Proposal by B. Jones
Item 146 - Notification vs. Posting of Loss Factors
Item 187 - TX SET Concurrent Processing Approach
Proposal by B. White
Item 204 - EPS Meter Data Transmittal
Proposal by J Cohea

In addition to to these items, the Protocols may have been changed to correct
unclear language or an inconsistency in the Protocols in an effort to 
reconcile
a gap.  These changes were identified in the PIP Master List as refinements 
and
carried a criticality assessment of 1.  I recommend your attention to these
items as well.

As there are about 100 PIP Items, we will not specifically address each one.
However, all parties are encouraged to raise questions or challenge any of the
reconciliation documents at the RUG meeting.

Yeah, just think of the lines we could use:

Hey baby, wanna come out and help me pitch my tent?
Your sleeping bag or mine?
Hey baby, lets go camping.  I'll supply the pork and beans.

I have discussed with Doug Gilbert-Smith the transmission contingent language 
e-mailed to you on 4-27-01 and am communicating the revised text below for 
insertion into those written confirmations of EPMI's purchases in ERCOT being 
supplied across a DC tie, when designated by the ERCOT traders to require 
this insert .  This text is only for those specific transactions which the 
ERCOT traders indicate.    

"Transmission Contingent: DC Tie.  If Seller is unable to secure the 
transmission required for this Transaction on a DC tie line across the ERCOT 
system border ("DC tie"),  or transmission on such DC tie is curtailed in a 
manner affecting Seller's delivery hereunder, then Seller at its election 
shall not be required to deliver the affected portion of the Energy and, in 
the event of that election by Seller, neither party shall be liable to the 
other hereunder for failure to deliver/receive such Energy.  No other 
transmission contingency is designated by the parties to pertain to this 
Transaction."

Guys, unfortunately, I think I'm going to have to bow out of our camping
trip this weekend. I have been rather ill over the last week and a half, and
I'm not sure that I'm up for the elements and all of the alcohol that are
involved in this weekend's festivities. I have been hoping to get better,
but between work and my cold, I don't think I'm up for it. Have fun and
please try not to make too much fun of the "silent one" while you are in a
wood kicking frenzy.

I also have a small tent that can be borrowed if "the silent one" emerges
from the depths of the legal system to join us on our quest for physical
pain, inebriation, and large, uncontrollable fires.

Brown Gets Big Raise; Assistant FB Coaches Also  Will Benefit

Texas ootball coach Mack Brown has been given a $450,000 raise to boost his
annual salary to  $1,450,000 and maintain his status among the top 10
highest-paid college football coaches in the country, Longhorn Athletic
Director DeLoss Dodds announced Tuesday.
Brown's raise is an increase from the 10-year, $1 million per year contract
that he signed following the 1998 season.  He will have eight years
remaining
on the $1.45 million per year contract.
"Mack has done a terrific job for The University of Texas, our Athletics
Department and the football program," Dodds said.  "We are extremely proud
of
everything he, his staff and the student-athletes have accomplished and are
excited about our future."
"It is very important that the head football coach at Texas remains in the
upper echelon of coaching compensation, which is an ever-changing dynamic,"
Dodds said. "This raise is in response to the current demand in the
coaching
marketplace and a well-deserved reward for Mack's hard work and dedication.
We are thrilled with the direction he has taken our football program and
look
forward to a long-lasting relationship."
Brown has led the Horns to three straight nine-win seasons for the first
time
since 1981-83 and is guiding UT to a third-straight bowl game for just the
second time since 1985. The No. 12 Longhorns  will face the No. 8 Oregon
Ducks  at the Culligan Holiday Bowl in San Diego on Dec. 29.
Brown's Texas program is one of only seven schools nationally that is
riding
a string of three straight nine-win campaigns.  Including a pair of 10-win
seasons at North Carolina prior to his arrival at Texas, Brown joins Bobby
Bowden (Florida State), Steve Spurrier (Florida) and Bill Snyder (Kansas
State) as the only NCAA Division I-A coaches who have led their teams to
five-straight nine-plus win seasons.
"I appreciate the continued commitment to our football program from The
University of Texas," Brown said.  "I'm proud to be the head coach of the
Longhorns."
Brown's assistant coaches also are in line for raises.
Football raises about $40 million of the entire $50 million budget for all
the men's and women's athletic programs. It is the only program that shows
a
profit. Baseball and men's and women's basketball are the only other major
revenue sports, and none of them produce as much revenue as they spend.
* * * *
FOOTBALL NOTES: Longhorn ticket sales are lagging for the Holiday Bowl are
lagging and Oregon fans are snapping up some of the 11,500 tickets that
were
allotted to Texas fans. If Longhorn fans don't step up quickly, Oregon fans
are going to occupy the vast majority of the seats in San Diego on Dec. 29.
.
. The Longhorns begin practicing for the bowl game Thursday. All the
practices will be closed to the public. . . Former Longhorn and pro
football
great Harley Sewell was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame
this
week. . . . Redshirt freshman WR Artie Ellis, who missed most of this
season
with a sore shin, will get a look at TE in spring practice. With the
emergence of freshman receivers Roy Williams, B. J. Johnson and Sloan
Thomas,
the 215-pound Ellis might have a better chance of seeing meaningful playing
time by beefing up a little and playing tight end. . . Another spring move
that is being contemplated is seeing if sophomore LG Derrick Dockery could
move over to LT to replace departing senior Leonard Davis. Texas has three
good guards in Dockery, Antwan Kirk-Hughes and Tillman Holloway. Mike
Williams is the only returning tackle who has seen a lot of action. In
addition to getting the best five linemen on the field at the same time,
that
move might give the offensive line more fire because Holloway is a very
aggressive lineman. The offensive line has frequently been cited as lacking
fire and leadership.
* * * *
FOOTBALL RECRUITING NOTES: The Longhorns are having their annual football
banq
uet this weekend. Most of the players making official visits will be
players
who already are committed to Texas, but there are at least two exceptions.
OL
William Winston of Houston Madison and S Rufus Harris of La Porte are both
scheduled to visit. Super LB Derrick Johnson of Waco now says he is going
to
take all of his visits in January. Texas leads for Winston and Johnson and
it
it a UT-A&M battle for Harris.

My next fax will be whenever events warrant.

Meeting on May 30 at 3:30pm regarding the new Option Model we (Steve Wang, 
Harry Arora, and Rob Stalford) use to make markets.  The old structuring 
model was created for marketer to give indicative pricing.  I have created 
this model especially for option market making.  As market makers we found 
the old model too slow as we are often making bid/offers in more than five 
strikes in more than five different months.  This model allows us to make our 
markets quicker and identify mispricings in the market before our 
competitors.  This is not to replace the old structuring model.  It is only a 
complement that will give everyone a better picture of where options are 
trading and where bid/offers are.  We will publish these prices weekly and 
will eventually have them on a daily basis.

You will need special permission to access the files located in 
M:\power2\Options.  Let me know if you want access to this folder.  The

Folks,

Please note, as per the email below, there will need to be different 
reporting requirements if we purchase from an industrial that does not have 
FERC market based rate authority.  I have added this as an item on our 
checklist.

Thanks,
Tom.

Tom--  Bad Christi, Bad Christi -- I now have you on my distribution.

 This order is only applicable when EPMI purchases power from an industrial 
that does not have a market based rates tariff (license) on file at FERC.  In 
that case. the purchases need to be flagged separately for EPMI's FERC report.

Subject: Easier for EPMI/EES to purchase from industrials

Attached is FERC authorization for EPMI and EES to purchase power from 
industrials NATIONWIDE (effective March 6, 2001--Does not expire).  The 
industrial does not have to obtain its own power marketer license from FERC 
(subject to EPMI and EES making certain after the fact quarterlty filings for 
the industrials). 

Specifics:

Owners of generating facilities located at business locations and used 
primarily for back-up for self-generation (who will be "public utilities" 
subject to the Federal Power Act only while they sell at wholesale) can sell 
power at wholesale from such facilities to EPMI and EES without prior notice 
under section 205 of FPA (would usually require 60 day advance notice 
filing).  
  -- Waives certain parts of the filing requirements for the industrial; 
however, the industrial will still be subject to shortened filing 
requirements for dispositions of facilities and interlocking positions while 
they are selling at wholesale.
 -- EPMI and EES will make the FERC quarterly filings on behalf of the 
industrials for any of these purchases.  Our report must show the names of 
the industrial; aggregate amount of capacity and/or energy purchased from 
each seller; and the aggregate compensation paid to each seller.  
Accounting/commercial folks for EPMI and EES-- please make sure these 
purchases are flagged in the accounting system, since the report will be 
separate from our big quarterly reports.
 -- This does not authorize the retail industrial customer to violate any 
rules or tariffs of its host utility.  This does not authorize an industrial 
to resell power it purchases (only can sell what it generates); unless 
otherwise allowed (or not precluded) by its retail tariff.

West Desk:  This is similar to the authorization that FERC gave last week to 
purchases from industrials in WSCC.


____________________________________
On April 27, FERC issued an order granting EPMI and EES the authority to 
purchase power from IPPs at market-based rates.  As the attached order 
indicates, the effective date of the EPMI and EES rate schedules is March 6, 
2001.

DJ REPEAT:Ercot Sees 56,373 MW Summer Peak,2% Below '00 Peak

DJ Ercot: New Units Will Boost Supply to 65,064 MW

DJ Ercot: 21% Summer Reserve If Normal Weather

DJ Ercot Summer -2: New 345-Kv Line To Relieve Congestion


By Eileen O'Grady
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

HOUSTON (Dow Jones)--After several tight summers, new generation and a new
transmission line in Texas should push the power region's summer reserve
above
20%, according to a projections from the Electric Reliability Council of
Texas.

According to a summer assessment study compiled by Ercot, utilities and
power
suppliers forecast a peak load demand of 56,373 megawatts this summer, 2% MW
under the record-shattering 2000 peak of 57,606 MW.

The lower peak forecast assumes a return to normal summer temperatures.
Last
summer, Texas saw record heat amid a drought that lasted 84 days in parts of
the
state. That increased power demand to record levels.

Ercot's projected peak of 54,817 MW for summer 2000 wound up being 5%
under
the actual peak seen Aug. 31.

Spot power prices jumped above $100 per megawatt-hour in four brief spikes
last summer, twice in May and again in July and August.

While drought conditions have eased since last summer, the report warns
that
Ercot's peak could jump to 58,550 MW if forecasts provided by investor-owned
utilities haven't included a possible shift in demand from customers
participating in a retail pilot project that begins June 1.

Even so, more than 3,350 MW of new generation is expected to be online
compared with last summer, pushing Ercot's net capacity resources to 65,064
MW,
according to the report.

The Ercot assessment says the new generation should keep the region's
reserve
margin above 20% in August when demand is expected to peak.

The Ercot report, however, includes 1,730 MW of "border" generation that
can
be sold into Ercot or into the Southwest Power Pool.

A separate report from the Texas Public Utility Commission staff pointed
out
several additional merchant generating plants slated to come online this
summer
in Ercot.

The PUC staff report paints a more bullish forecast for demand. The PUC
said
coincident peak demand for power in Ercot grew at a compound rate of 4.3%
from
1995 to 2000.

Total annual energy consumption in Ercot grew by nearly 7.5% from 1999 to
2000, according to the PUC.

The 21% reserve margin in August is twice the amount seen last summer. It
includes 2,870 MW of interruptible demand, slightly below last summer's
3,000 MW
of available load that could be curtailed.

Ercot transmission constraints are expected to be reduced dramatically
this
summer as an additional 345-kilovolt line running from Limestone power
station
to the Watermill switchyard is expected to be in service this month,
alleviating
the south-to-north congestion seen in the last two summers.

Additional lines are in the planning stages to relieve the west-to-east
flow
from Morgan Creek.

On June 1, Ercot will become a single control area as the region moves
toward
full retail competition beginning Jan. 1.

The current interregional transfer limit is 785 MW across the state's two
direct-current ties with SPP although there is expected to be some
limitation
this summer due to a breaker problem near the east DC tie.

Because Ercot lacks synchronous interconnection with the rest of the U.S.
power grid, the region has limited ability to import electricity in times of
high demand.

Ercot is a group of interconnected utilities that serves about 85% of the
power load in the state.

I Created a TECO FRONTERA folder for these documents under the eservices 
directory.

I also put a fuel usage calculator that is fairly useful under eservices as 
well.

We are talking to people about providing this same scheduling service.  APX 
will probably be one of our biggest competitors.  We need to get a software 
system that is able to automate our trading schedules to the ISO, as well as, 
schedules for anyone else we sign up to represent them as their QSE.  - Mike

Subject: ERCOT Market Readiness Meeting #5 Follow-up


On the day after the ERCOT Market Readiness Meeting, all market participants
are keenly aware of the limited amount of time left before system testing,
the mock market and the opening of the pilot market in June 2001.
Regardless of the amount of energy and resources invested, time seems to be
accelerating toward deadlines.

One of the complex development projects is the Qualified Scheduling Entity
(QSE) function.  Market participants may still be resolving development,
implementation, communication and staffing issues.  The financial costs
related to self-providing QSE services are substantial, and for some
participants, a major barrier.

Automated Power Exchange (APX) is an independent entity (takes no position
in the market) that will operate in ERCOT as a QSE.  APX currently operates
as an independent Scheduling Coordinator to the CaISO in California.  APX is
offering a variety of flexible solutions for the QSE function.  These
solutions include:

APX acts as the QSE for a market participant:  market participants can
select APX as their QSE.  APX provides the platform for participants to
schedule energy and ancillary services to ERCOT, and provides settlement
support.  Participants can also access the APX energy and ancillary services
trading exchanges continuously.  Because APX is an independent provider,
participants are assured that their market information is confidential.  The
fee for this service is volumetric and affordable.

APX as an Application Service Provider (ASP) to a participating QSE:  APX
offers other QSEs the opportunity to utilize APX technology for any or all
of the following functions:  scheduling energy and ancillary services to
ERCOT, creating settlement statements and other functionality that a market
participant may need.  Since APX is utilizing the same technology for it's
own QSE service, participants who choose to utilize APX as their ASP are
assured that the technology exists and is ready for each testing phase, the
mock market and the pilot market.  The fees for this service can either be
volumetric are annual, based upon individual participant preferences.

As your organization continues to make decisions about the implementation of
the QSE function, APX is ready to discuss ways to assist the process and
ease the time constraints that all market participants are facing.  Contact
me for a more detailed discussion.

Looks fine to me.  Pls let me know if there's anything I can do to help going 
forward.  I think that we have a very good relationship in place with these 
guys.  

Eric / Jeffrey - I'm going to be in Austin on Friday, and would like to stop 
by the plant around 9 am to check it out.  I'm playing phone tag with Chris 
and Andy to check their availability (I know Chris has a staff meeting at 
that time).  Pls let me know if you guys are going to be around then (don't 
make a special trip).

Regards,
Billy

Subject: Austin Sandhill Mgt Committee

To transition Enron's Sandhill Management Committee members from Jim/Billy to 
Kevin/Dave I have drafted and legal has reviewed a notification letter 
(attached below) that Jim Ducote is going to hand deliver to Andy Ramirez 
(Austin's Mgt Committee member) at a meeting he has with him on Monday 5/21 
to insure a smooth transition.

The management committee meetings are held whenever necessary approximately 
once per month during construction, but should be less frequent now that the 
plant is to be operational May 23.  Jim has mentioned there will be some 
issues that need to be cleaned up such as the plant's construction delay (was 
guaranteed to be complete 5/1) at the next meeting that should take place in 
June.  Also, I think adding capacity to the demineralization plant is a 
"no-brainer" to enable us to run the plant at full on the weekends.

Kevin/Dave if you would like to call Andy Ramirez his number is (512) 
322-6479.

If anyone has any concerns with this transition please call me asap at 
x3-4258.  

Thanks, - Mike

Charged Up:
Texas May Face a Glut
Of Electricity, but That
Won't Aid Rest of U.S.
---
Pride and Policy Make State
A Magnet  for Power Plants
And an Island Unto Itself
---
A Wire Enshrined in Lucite
----
By Alexei Barrionuevo and Russell Gold
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

The Wall Street Journal via Dow Jones

While California struggles to keep its lights on and New York City braces
for
possible electricity shortages this summer, Texas utilities could soon face
the
opposite problem: a power glut.

Texas' wide-open spaces and relatively weak zoning and environmental rules
have helped make the Lone Star state a magnet for power-generation companies
as
it prepares to deregulate its electricity market next year. The result:
Texas'
electricity-production capacity this summer is expected to exceed its peak
power
demand by 11,000 megawatts -- nearly enough to light up New York City. By
the
summer of 2002, the excess may be closer to 15,000 megawatts, enough to
power 15
million homes. And with 27 new generating plants under construction, more
than
any other state, some power producers fear that overbuilding ultimately
could
send Texas' wholesale electricity prices into a tailspin.

All this sounds like good news for the electricity-starved East and West
Coasts -- but it isn't. That's because the U.S. is divided into three major
power grids -- with the West on one, the East on another and most of Texas
on a
third, with very few links to the rest of the country. In the world of
electricity, that makes Texas "an island with a couple of little footpaths
over
to it," says Larry Makovich, senior director for electric power research at
Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a Cambridge, Mass., consulting firm.

Some Texas utility executives argue that their state's island status is
principally an accident of geography. But no one disputes the fact that good
old
Texas pride -- and a deep-seated skepticism toward federal regulation --
also
played a role in shaping the state's grid. So, too, did a renegade utility's
desperate 1976 bid to save itself from a corporate breakup and the resulting
four-year legal battle, which the industry later dubbed the "Texas Range
War."

Texas' isolation isn't expected to end anytime soon. If Texas became fully
interconnected, its big utilities say, the state could become more
susceptible
to blackouts, if other regions drew off too much power. "From a reliability
standpoint, it would be a degradation to the Texas grid," says Steve
Schaeffer,
a senior vice president at Reliant Energy Inc., the former Houston Lighting
&
Power Co.

Moreover, the utilities estimate that building the transmission lines
needed
for a full connection to the nation's other grids would take at least three
years and cost Texas ratepayers about $600 million. They don't want to
invest
that much money to sell power to California or New York to ease what they
view
as temporary imbalances.

Some in the state also believe low rates and excess power could give it an
advantage in persuading businesses to locate there. "America will be shy
enough
electricity that this will be one of our greatest inducements for growing
Texas," says Matthew Simmons, president of Houston investment bank Simmons &
Co.

Texas is an extreme example of the haphazard way electricity grids
developed
in the U.S. Until the 1960s, most power plants were built near the customers
they served. Then, utilities began building larger, more-efficient coal and
nuclear plants, connecting them with their neighbors to ensure that if one
of
these big plants went down, there would be a backup ready to keep the power
flowing.

But the old-line Texas utilities, which have long benefited from the
state's
plentiful supplies of fuels such as natural gas and lignite coal, were
reluctant
to join in this wave of interconnections. Back then, in the mid- to late
1970s,
electricity outside Texas was generally more costly. And surrounding states
weren't planning big enough plants to back up the huge new ones Texas was
building to power its fast-growing cities and energy-thirsty petrochemical
industry. "There was no big money to be made by shipping power one way or
the
other over the lines," says Reliant's Mr. Schaeffer.

By confining their grid to Texas, state utilities also avoided oversight
by
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Thus, FERC couldn't force Texas to
send power out of state in case of an emergency.

The state's dominant utilities -- Texas Utilities Inc., the Dallas-based
predecessor of what is now TXU Corp., and Houston Lighting -- went to great
lengths to ensure there were no interstate connections. The switches at a
hydroelectric plant on the Texas-Oklahoma border were wired to prevent power
from flowing between the states. Elsewhere along the border, a system of
relays
was installed to prevent unauthorized interstate transmissions.

Only one big utility didn't like the setup: Central & South West Corp., a
Dallas holding company that owned power plants in both Texas and Oklahoma.
In
1976, it faced a crisis. If it couldn't show that its plants in both states
were
interconnected, it ran the risk of being broken up under a federal law. The
law,
which barred holding companies from owning unconnected utilities in separate
states, was decades old. But, until then, it hadn't been strictly enforced.

On May 4, 1976 -- eight days before the Securities and Exchange Commission
was
set to consider the matter -- Central & South West took an extraordinary
step.
At 5:30 a.m., it sent one of its line crews to secretly rewire a substation
in
Vernon, Texas, near the Oklahoma border, allowing power to flow freely
between
the two states. For a few hours, the grids were connected by a minuscule
thread.
Later that morning, officials at Central & South West phoned other Texas
utilities to tell them the company was engaged in interstate commerce.

Texas' other major utilities reacted angrily. "The sons of bitches are
trying
to steal my lignite!" Texas Utilities Chairman Louis Austin bellowed,
according
to former Texas Public Utility Commissioner George Cowden, who recalls Mr.
Austin making the remark during a private meeting between the two men.

Around noon, Houston Lighting cut its system off from the rest of the
state's
utilities. Texas Utilities followed suit hours later. By day's end, the
state's
utilities had broken the grid into a half-dozen pieces.

That same day, one of Texas Utilities' chief lawyers, a 6-foot-6 former
college-football star named J.A. "Tiny" Gooch, dispatched one of his
company's
crews to disconnect the link Central & South West had made between Vernon
and
Altus, Okla. "They made it so it was physically impossible to [connect] it
again," says Mr. Gooch's son, Gordon, then a lawyer representing Houston
Lighting. The elder Mr. Gooch, who died in 1986, is considered the patron
saint
of Texas' electrical independence.

At an emergency meeting of the utility commission three days later, Mr.
Austin
of Texas Utilities expressed disgust at the prospect of having to burn Texas
lignite and natural gas to satisfy "Yankees," according to a transcript.
And, he
added: "I don't like federal regulations." (Mr. Austin died in 1997.)

A wire reputed to have formed part of Central & South West's brief
Texas-Oklahoma interconnection later was cut into pieces, encased in Lucite
and
given out as paperweights by Dallas law firm Worsham, Forsythe & Woolridge,
which represented Texas Utilities.

Alan Erwin, a state utility commissioner in 1976 who still has the
souvenir on
his desk, used the wiring episode as fodder for a 1979 novel, "The Power
Exchange," in which a winter storm cripples Northeast power production and
the
nation turns to Texas for electricity. Texas refuses to ship the
electricity,
fearful that other regions would drain it of "what little cheap fuel was
left."
Ultimately, Texas becomes a scapegoat and ends up seceding from the union.

In reality, the outcome was less dramatic. The grid conflict wound its way
through many courtrooms. Central & South West -- recently acquired by
American
Electric Power Co. of Columbus, Ohio -- lost almost every round. After about
four years, the utilities hashed out a compromise, at the urging of the
federal
government.

Rather than link the Texas grid to the East, so that electricity could
flow
freely across state borders through alternating-current cables, they agreed
to
build two direct-current lines. Operators could control the flow over these
bridges, which at peak capacity could carry a mere 820 megawatts. The
parties to
the deal, which included the federal government, agreed these links wouldn't
bring the Texas grid under federal jurisdiction. Today, Texas power
continues to
be regulated in Austin, not Washington.

"It's just a Texas thing," says Pat Wood III, chairman of the state
utility
commission and a recent Bush administration nominee to FERC. "We want
control of
our own destiny."

That independent attitude has extended in recent years to Texas'
business-friendly approach to deregulating its power industry. Unlike
California, with its stringent emissions and zoning rules, Texas has made it
quick and easy for power companies to locate their plants almost anywhere
they
can find a place to hook up to the grid. Last year, Texas completed a major
upgrade to alleviate bottlenecks on the grid, and it has six similar
projects
under way. Unlike most other states, it decided to charge grid users a flat
rate
to move power anywhere in the state, so they could put plants in low-cost
rural
areas, far from their customers.

Those policies, as well as projections that the state's electricity demand
would grow by a robust 3.5% a year, set off a flurry of power-plant
construction, beginning in 1998. Since then, $11 billion worth of power
plants
have been completed or started in Texas, and more are on the drawing board.

By contrast to California's approach to deregulation, which largely failed
to
bring new plants online, Texas' strategy "encouraged an overbuild," says Mr.
Makovich, of Cambridge Energy Research Associates.

Consider tiny Seguin in south central Texas, where Constellation Energy
Group
Inc. of Baltimore is building an 800-megawatt gas-powered plant in a former
cornfield. Fifteen miles to the west, Texas Independent Energy LP of Dallas
recently finished a 1,000-megawatt plant. About the same distance to the
north,
American National Power, a Houston-based unit of Britain's International
Power
PLC, is building a 1,100-megawatt plant.

If generators don't get cold feet, Texas is on track to have a capacity
surplus of 9% this summer and 11% by summer 2002, says Cambridge Energy
Research
Associates. That's in addition to the 15% surplus that most experts consider
an
adequate cushion. Some areas of the country, including parts of the
Southeast,
Upper Midwest, New York City and the West, are struggling with razor-thin
capacity margins. After factoring in a similar 15% cushion, the West has an
8%
capacity deficit and the Upper Midwest has a 4% deficit.

As a result, while electricity futures prices for summer are running at as
much as $400 per megawatt hour in the Northwest and around $100 in the
Northeast, Texas futures prices are averaging only $72 to $74 per megawatt
hour.

Calpine Corp. of San Jose, Calif., is making the boldest wager that
overcapacity and a lack of export possibilities won't sink Texas' wholesale
electricity prices. The company has six plants under construction in the
state,
two of which are expected to come on line next month. And it plans to add an
additional five plants over the next two years. Altogether, Calpine plans to
spend about $2.8 billion in the state, its largest investment outside
California.

"People from day one probably thought Calpine was crazy," says Darrell
Hayslip, a company vice president. "But so far, we are absolutely convinced
that
this is the right bet." He says Calpine's newer gas-fired plants are 40%
more
efficient than older plants in the state, a third of which are at least 30
years
old. Calpine expects that edge to force rivals to retire older plants, thus
keeping electricity prices from sagging.

Others aren't so sure. After initially planning new plants in Texas, Duke
Energy Corp. began to worry that the state was getting overbuilt. Last May,
Duke, of Charlotte, N.C., sold its 80% stake in a plant under construction
in
south Texas to Calpine. "We sized up the market early, and then realized too
many followers were doing the same thing," says Jim Donnell, president and
CEO
of Duke Energy North America.

If the electricity situation outside Texas grows too grim and too much
supply
sinks prices in the state, there could be "renewed pressure" for Texas to
study
interconnection options, says John Stauffacher, vice president for
regulatory
affairs at Houston-based Dynegy Inc., which has 1,000 megawatts of capacity
in
Texas.

Calpine, for one, wouldn't mind sharing Texas power with the East and
West. "I
would love to be able to wheel power from Texas to California," says Mr.
Hayslip. But, so far, the Texas utilities haven't budged in their opposition
to
exports.

A few generators are trying to find the best of both worlds. Tenaska Inc.
of
Omaha, Neb., is building plants at the border between the Texas and eastern
grids. Though utilities aren't allowed to be connected to both grids at
once,
the plants are designed to allow the company to switch between grids as
demand
and prices warrant.

In rural Grimes County, about 90 miles outside Houston, Tenaska plant
manager
Frank Carelli boasts that his 830-megawatt plant could disconnect from one
grid,
connect to the other and be back at full power within an hour. A similar
Tenaska
plant is slated to begin operations this month in Rusk County, near the
Louisiana border.

At last week's RUG meeting, I was asked to prepare
a brief description of what is in ESCA's current
design for deployment of Balancing Energy Service.
I hope the attached document is what you were
expecting.  I have also included some design notes
I found on the issue of ERCOT operator's name and
receiving operator's names in the dispatch
instruction.  Let me know if additional detail is
needed.

Mike,

1.  Please see attached spreadsheet.
2.  Ditto.
3.  Attached spreadsheets have some info.  I am working on more detail for 
you.
4.  I am seeking response from TPS engineering.
5.  I am seeking additional info from TPS environmental.
6.  See spreadsheets.  No duct firing.

- Frank

P.S.  On the Heat Rate Spreadsheet, look@ the 2x1 and 1x1 tabs (it is a work 
in progress).

What about the 'operational tools' you referred to that you may have on the 
shelf and can provide to me?


>>> "Curry, Mike" <Mike.Curry@ENRON.com> 04/11/01 01:54PM >>>
Frank, here is the list of operational info that I think would be
helpful to our team:

1) Ramp Rates for plant (ramp up and down)
 - zero to 139 MW (this is probably N/A due to permit concerns?)
 - 140 to 230 MW
 - 231 to 280 MW (this is probably N/A due to permit concerns?)
 - 281 to 460 MW

2) Heat Rate Curves
 - vs. output
 - vs. Temp. / Rel. Humidity

3) Start charge (in MMBtu) -  please define each, i.e. cold start means
plant has been down x hours
 - cold start
 - warm start
 - hot start

4) Is there a maximum number of starts per year?

5) Is there any permit limitations other than below?
 - In 1x1 must operate only between 140 MW and 230MW approx. to
stay within permit limits?
 - In 2x1 must operate only between 280 MW and 460MW approx. to
stay within permit limits?
 - Annual limit on run time or tons of emission?
 - What is a violation, is it any deviation or must the deviation
occur for a min. amount of time?

6) Operational limits
 - In 1x1 operates between 140 MW and 230MW approx.
 - In 2x1 operates between 280 MW and 460MW approx.
 - Any other level that can be operated?  Any duct firing?

Thanks for your assistance with these, - Mike

 Rate

Mike/Clint-

Water consumption/make-up at Austin is as follows:

Water Make-up rate from the water plant into the demin tank is 120 gpm
Water Usage Rate of the plant at full load is 234.4 gpm

Therefor, when the plant is not running, the tank (300,000 gallon capacity) 
is filled at the rate of 120 gpm;
when the plant is running flat out, the net drawdown on the tank is 114.4 gpm 
(234.4-120=114.4).

If you do the math, if you start out Monday morning at 6 am and run the plant 
for 5 days a week for 15 hours a day, then come Friday evening at 9 pm, there 
will
be 44,400 gallons in the tank.  It will then take you 35.5 hours to fill the 
tank again which is Sunday at 8:30 am.  If you do the math, you could 
potentially run the plant for a full 15 hours on Saturday, but at the end of 
the day you would only have 6,240 gallons left in the tank and you could not 
fill it in time for Monday morning.

GE's performance program states that the LM6000 without water injection has a 
NOx level of about 200 ppm.  Our SCR reduces NOx about 80% (down to 5 ppm) 
WITH water injection.  WIthout water injection and starting at 200 ppm the 
SCR is probably not going to give you 80% effectiveness, but it might keep us 
under the instantaneous NOx limit set out in our permit (~100 ppm).  I will 
have to do a little more research on this one.

Based on some initial calculations that we did early on, with a constant 
pipeline pressure, heat rate improves by approximately 50 btu/kwh (HHV) for 
every 10oF of drop in ambient temperature.  When we run the plant this 
summer, we can obviously get some better data.

Hope this helps,

Eric

Please find attached the PIP master list and the first set of PIP documents
for your review prior to the RUG meeting. As requested, the PIP master list
identifies items which are believe to require input and/or vote from RUG.

The PIP items that I currently have as requiring as RUG vote (based on the
notes) are as follows:

108 --sub QSE (payment process, invoicing, and liability) --proposal by C.
Moseley
200 and 104 --LSE/QSE Load Ration (at the QSE or LSE level) --proposal by B.
Jones
146 --Notifications vs. posting of Loss Factors
187 --TX SET Concurrent Processing approach --proposal by B. White
204 --EPS Meter Data Transmittal --proposal by J. Cohea

PIP item 112 (BUL) will be delivered tomorrow, as there is still some
follow-up regarding the formula.  When it is completed, it will be sent out
to this exploder.



If there is a PIP item missing from this grouping, please check the master
list, as it may have been resolved or merged with another item during the
PIP process.

Vince - 

I certainly appreciate the opportunity to have our group attend
a session given by Enron Research.  While afternoons are typically
the best time to meet, we do have a trader's meeting each Mon & Wed
at 3:30.  If we can accomodate this regular meeting either by scheduling
an earlier meeting on Monday or going for Tue/Thurs, that would be 
great.  Otherwise we can go ahead with the Mon @ 3:30 with an audience
that might be a bit smaller.

Thanks again

George

To transition Enron's Sandhill Management Committee members from Jim/Billy to 
Kevin/Dave I have drafted and legal has reviewed a notification letter 
(attached below) that Jim Ducote is going to hand deliver to Andy Ramirez 
(Austin's Mgt Committee member) at a meeting he has with him on Monday 5/21 
to insure a smooth transition.

The management committee meetings are held whenever necessary approximately 
once per month during construction, but should be less frequent now that the 
plant is to be operational May 23.  Jim has mentioned there will be some 
issues that need to be cleaned up such as the plant's construction delay (was 
guaranteed to be complete 5/1) at the next meeting that should take place in 
June.  Also, I think adding capacity to the demineralization plant is a 
"no-brainer" to enable us to run the plant at full on the weekends.

Kevin/Dave if you would like to call Andy Ramirez his number is (512) 
322-6479.

If anyone has any concerns with this transition please call me asap at 
x3-4258.  

Thanks, - Mike

Attached is a simple model which computes the MW line impact on the two CSCs 
for a proposed MW transfer.  A couple of you have asked how to interpret the 
shift factors released from the ISO and this spreadsheet performs the 
computation for you.

I created a temporary position file for you in the NewSys/Ercot folder called 
Ercot Asst.  It should get you by until IT can build something else.  Also, 
your gas book should be accessible also.  See ya when I get there at

Clint Dean logs into EPMI-ERCOT-ASST as his power book, and needs to be 
mapped to PWR-NG-ERCT-AST as his gas book.  Let me know what other

Hi All,

As of today, MetaStock has several new functions. The most important new 
feature is the ability to display forward HEAT RATE charts. 
Also, notice that the interface looks different -- this reflects and 
accommodates the new features. The help files (on the left of the applet) 
fully describe and explain all the changes and additions to the program. 

If you have any questions regarding this new version of MetaStock, please 
contact Anna Santucci (x. 34225) for user questions or Mark Symms (x. 33105) 
for technical questions. And, of course, you can ask these questions once you 
log into the MegaWatt Station (the virtual one).

Response Requested May 4 
Three files attached 

Attached is the preliminary TTC/ATC calculations between CM/CSC Zones for On

based upon thermal limits (RateB) between CM/CSC Zones is:

South to North?? 3,700 - 3,800 MW 
West to North??? 1,100 - 1,200 MW 
West to South????? 500 -?? 600 MW 
North to South?? 1,100 - 2,300 MW 
North to West????? 800 -?? 850 MW 
South to West????? 300 -?? 350 MW 

We request SSWG review these calculations and provide any changes or updates 
no later than Friday May 4. 

Thanks Ken D.

after you get married.

Nothing really wrong, but Jenn and I decided to go our separate ways.? I 
still talk to her, and I think she's a great girl.? Its just that something 
wasn't there.? I don't really know what my deal is, but I guess when we got 
to the same city finally, we didn't quite have the same passion anymore.
It is actually very sad.? Like I said, she is a great girl, and I still 
care about her a lot.? She is in Laredo right now for work, and I think we 
are going to Galveston together on Sunday.

I hope to talk to you soon.

Jerry/Eric/Frank,  

Attached please find a "Unit Contingent" call option proposal that I had 
promised you at our last meeting.  The thought here is Frontera could sell 
energy firm from the plant (once you become comfortable with its operation) 
and hedge most of the risk of a unit outage with this product.  The time to 
do this is when the premium for a firm product (roughly $5/MWh) is greater 
than the price of this product (roughly mid to high $2's).  You will find 
both an indicative proposal for Jun-Sep01 (I am not suggesting this term but 
wanted to give you a feel for the pricing) and the entire standard contract 
attached below for your review. 

This may require further explanation on my part but I thought I would send it 
to you now so you can become familiar with it.  Please call if you have any 
questions, - Mike 713-853-4258

Doug -- Following up on our discussion, attached is the single definition of 
ERCOT Unplanned B product currently traded on EOL.  Although a different 
transition can be arranged with EOL, they ordinarily show a 'banner' on the 
day that the product change is instituted and for a couple days afterwards, 
stating that the product definition has changed and very briefly summarizing 
the change.  Let's talk about what should be done to the definition below.  
My understanding is that new Operating Guides are not being published at or 
before the June 1 market transition.

DJ Texas Power Export Capacity Returns To Normal

HOUSTON (Dow Jones)--Southwestern Electric Power Co. confirmed Monday that a
breaker problem near the 600-megawatt eastern direct-current tie has been
repaired, allowing exports from Texas to return to normal.

The breaker problem, which began last month at the coal-fired Welsh plant
in
Cason, Texas, could have lasted all summer, the utility had warned the
Independent System Operator for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas.

The breaker problem had limited exports by 100 MW from Ercot into the
adjacent
Southwest Power Pool.

SWEPCO is a unit of American Electric Power (AEP).

The east DC tie connects the transmission network of TXU Electric and
SWEPCO.

The east DC tie is the larger of two devices in the state, which allow a
combined 800 MW of power to be imported or exported from Ercot to SPP.

Ercot's northern DC tie, which connects the West Texas Utilities Co.
system to
Public Service Co. of Oklahoma, is rated at 220 MW.

hear from you since you've been over there.  Do you miss Reliant?  Is El
Paso treating you well?  I'm doing well, but drinks will have to wait.  I'm
working very hard right now.  I'm going to the Kentucky Derby this weekend.
It should be fun.  John Kim is going as well.

At the TAC meeting in October, TAC formed the
Protocol Implementation Work Group (PIWG).  The
timeline for the work group's activities included
a milestone of ERCOT staff delivering a summary of
the Protocol/System gaps on November 15th.  This
message is the delivery of that summary.

The Consortium conducted a reconciliation of the
November 1 Protocols to the system design.  ERCOT
staff reviewed the reconciliation provided by the
Consortium.  There were a number of issues
included in the reconciliation that are still
under review with the vendors.  The finalization
of that review is being completed as quickly as
possible.  Based on the decisions during the
review, there may be some more issues that will
need to be added to the Protocol Implementation
Plan (PIP).

There were a number of issues that relate to
things that are in the November 1 Protocols that
are not in the current system design and will not
be available on June 1, 2001.  ERCOT staff worked
very hard over the last few days to prepare those
issues to be sent to the PIWG for review and
criticality analysis.  ERCOT staff used the
November 1 Protocols as a baseline.  We boxed the
language that related to things that would not be
available and in effect on June 1, 2001.  The box
includes a PIP Issue number, explanation of the
reason the Nov. 1 language is in the box, and an
explanation of the restoration process for the
November 1 language.  In the body of the Protocol
document, we drafted redline language which
reflects what will be in place on June 1, 2001.

The attached files contain:

(1)   PIP Master List - This is a master list of
all the Protocol Implementation Plan (PIP) issues
that have been identified to date.  It contains an
issue name, Protocol subsection reference, summary
of the issue, status, and ERCOT author.

(2)  A file for each PIP issue which contains an
excerpt from the Nov. 1 Protocol reflecting the
boxes and redlined language.

(3)  Reconciliation documents for PIP issues that
the PIWG has already discussed.

All of these issues will be discussed at PIWG
meetings.  We will be working with Brad Jones,
PIWG Chair, to set up the meeting days and the
agenda for reviewing each of these issues.  The
agenda will be published prior to the meetings so
that organizations have the opportunity to
identify the appropriate persons to attend.  In
addition, ERCOT staff will be working with the
PIWG during the discussions of each issue.

The PIWG has a lot to accomplish in a short amount
of time.  ERCOT staff has prepared the issues to
help expedite the process and contribute to the
process.  We look forward to completing the PIP.

Over the past ninety-three years Delta Sigma Phi at the University of Texas 
has continued to evolve and change.  We all have experiences and memories 
within the fraternity that will last a lifetime.  Today Delta Sigma Phi is at 
a crucial point in establishing itself as an organizational leader on 
campuses both nationwide and at the University of Texas.

The key to the success of Delta Sigma Phi is recruiting high quality men.  
Steps have already been taken by the Alumni Control Board and the 
undergraduate chapter to recruit a better man.  Recently, the ACB has raised 
semester scholarships for the highest GPA for an active and pledge to $250.  
Also with the mortgage on the house paid for, the ACB now also provides free 
semester rent in the house for double occupancy to any member that made a 3.5 
GPA or better the previous semester.   This next fall we will have a full 
house with four inhouse brothers qualifying for free rent.

During our time as undergraduates we lived the Eta Experience.  Our 
friendships and memories were fueled by the statement "You join Delta Sigma 
Phi for life."  All of us can reflect, as I have in my chapter advisor report 
in the soon to be released newsletter, about the importance that the 
fraternity has had on our lives.  However, the extending network of 
brotherhood should not end when we graduate from school.  In an effort to 
recruit the highest quality men it is necessary to provide an established 
alumni base that is willing to work with members not only while they are in 
school but also once they become alumni themselves.

I along with many of you have in the past become disenchanted with the 
undergraduates for one reason or another.  I certainly do not approve of the 
undergraduate actions of old.  However, today a good quality group of men 
exist.  Grades are at the highest they've been since I've become involved 
almost 3 years ago.  Long gone are the days of active members enrolled at 
ACC, St Eds, or not even enrolled at all.  Times are definitely changing.

Part of that change includes the current undergraduate chapter and the ACB 
proactively contacting Eta alumni to grow this network.  With the summer upon 
us, the undergraduate members are asking for alumni to help in the recruiting 
process.  A few of us in Austin, Houston, and Dallas have volunteered to take 
undergraduates and rushees to small events: lunch, dinner, sporting events, 
etc.  I invite all alumni to help the undergraduate chapter this summer as 
well as in the future.  Please contact me by e-mail (MeliaTim@aol.com) or by 
phone (512 707-0813), and I will put you and the undergraduates in your area 
in touch.

My friend at CPSB (Johnny Forbes) and I were talking last night and he told 
me that RHLP had been running test on their Ranger system which is the system 
that will run CPSB generation and interface with the ISO.  Johnny says that 
for the last three weeks, each time that RHLP had tried to run the Ranger 
system the Joint ACE and the units would not respond.  Their are many bugs in 
the system!

Johnny said the CPSB Ranger system is still in a box on the floor in the 
Control Room.  Their is talk at CPSB that it will be at least three months 
before the ISO begins to work as planned.

Johnny also told me that the Texas State Senate had passed some sort of Bill 
that would allow Ercot to postpone the Deregulation process.  According to 
Johnny,  ERCOT is just waiting for someone  ( ENRON, RHLP, AEP-CNTRL etc. ) 
to say they are not ready before they exercise this option.  

I hope this information is of some value and not just some gossip!

Scott, if you have a hard time finding alternate camp sites, I suggest we
camp in the field next to The Show Palace.  <g>

Mike, Clint-

I've done some more research on water usage and have some revised consumption 
rates which are less than what I told you last week.

Using the rates that I have listed below, if you run 5 days/week (weekdays), 
16 hours/day (not 15 as I previously mentioned) say 6 am to 10 pm, at GE's 
worse case consumption rate (+20% margin) , the tank will just be empty 
Friday night (10 pm) at the end of the 16 hour run.  I then takes 
approximately 42 hours to refill the tank.  (filling is completed by late 
Sunday afternoon)

At GE's "expected" consumption rate (no margin), the consumption rate is so 
much better that you could potentially run for 15 days straight, at 16 
hours/day before you exhausted the tank.

Next week when we run the performance test, we will know exactly what the 
actual consumtion rates will be.  In addition, I think (hope) that there 
might be some additional capacity in the demin plant.  The 120 gpm number is 
the guarantee from the vendor and at that rate the water quality is better 
than what we need.  I'm going to see if I can get someone to increase the 
flowrate until we are just at the limits for water quality.  I'll let you 
know what that number is. 

I do agree with you in that extra demin capacity is a no brainer.  Hopefully 
by the end of next week, I will know exactly how much extra we would need.

By the way, there is one additional piece of info that I was informed of 
today.  I been told that there is some language in the participation 
agreement that says our variable O&M costs increases after we exceed 1300 
hours of operation.

Hope this helps.  If you have questions, give me a call.  I'm in Austin all 
week.

Thanks,
Eric Booth

Consumption/Make-up Rates:
Demin plant make-up rate: 120 gpm
Demin Tank capacity:  300,000 gallons

Maximum or worse case Consumption rate of the plant with all four units 
running full load:  236 gpm  (this has a +20% margin included by GE)
Therefor, when the plant is running, net drawdown rate on the tank is 
(236-120) = 116 gpm

Expected consumption rate for the plant with all four units running at full 
load:  197 gpm (this does not have any extra margin included)
Therefor, when the plant is running, net drawdown rate on the tank is 
(197-120) = 77 gpm

Subject: 

Today the Protocol Review Subcommittee passed unanimously a revision request 
that will allow ercot to grant "provisional authorization" to QSE to provide 
ancillary services for a period of 90 days while any deficiencies in the 
certification can be corrected.  The request will be sent to the TAC where it 
will have an e-mail vote and I would not anticipate any opposition. 

To receive the "provisional authorization" the QSE needs to have performed an 
Ancillary Services qualification test in good faith but failed to qualify due 
to problems that in the opinion of ERCOT, are noncritical for providing one 
or more ancillary services.  My understanding is that Frontera has not had 
the primary test.  According to John Adams at ERCOT four have been scheduled 
and subsequently cancelled.  It will be critical to schedule and complete the 
test to be considered for the "provisional authorization".  

I spoke with John Adams regarding staffing to help perform the qualification 
tests and he said that they would be able to do the certification tests at 
about any time without any major scheduling delays.  The only time when they 
would not be able to do the tests would be when ESCA will take control of the 
systems to perform cut-over operations.

North2001 Zone  R6A-NorthTexas
West2001 Zone  R6B-WestTexas
South2001 Zone R6D-Texas-Valley

There is still no delivery point set up for the curve R6C-Central Texas.  
Please advise.  I have changed all deals that previously had Texas-Valley as 
a delivery point.  Please do not use this delivery point anymore.  I will 
have it deleted as soon as possible, but it may still show up for the next 
couple of days.

I will investigate the counterparty situation.  Had you had a chance to talk 
to Rhonda Denton?

DEAR STACEY:

I wanted to check with you and see how it was going in adding the North, 
South and West zones for Ercot that we had spoken about.

Also we will need to add the counterparites:  EPMI ERCOT POOL - for capturing 
congestion across zones and also ERCOT IMBALANCE -  for capturing when we are 
taking a position against the pool price.

I would like to have these set up by the end of next week because the new 
scheduling system with be here to test with.

Thank you,

AEP, LCRA plan $500 mln Texas power grid expansion

SAN FRANCISCO, May 23 (Reuters) - A public power company and investor-owned 
American Electric Power (NYSE:AEP - news) plan to pump $500 million over the 
next five years into a program designed to upgrade the power grid serving 
southern and western Texas.



The joint venture between AEP and the Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA), 
approved on Wednesday by LCRA's board of directors, aims to reach a final 
agreement on financing and implementing the plan in June.

``We expect to have a final negotiated contract in June and hope to start 
construction on specific projects by the end of the summer,'' LCRA spokesman 
Robert Cullick said.

Projects in the program, which require approval by the Texas Public Utilities 
Commission (PUC), include boosting the voltage on existing transmission 
lines, building new lines, upgrading substations, and hooking up new power 
plants.

According to the PUC, Texas currently has 27 new power plants under 
construction that will put nearly 14,000 megawatts on the grid when completed 
over the next few years, roughly enough electricity to supply 14 million 
homes.

The boom in power plant construction responds to a surge in energy demand 
from rapidly growing cities in the region like Corpus Christie and Larado in 
southern Texas, which have seen their populations grow by 40 percent over the 
past decade.

While the generation side of the industry has been aggressively expanding, 
the Texas grid needed to carry that electricity to consumers has been cited 
in the power industry as cause for concern.

Earlier this month the North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) 
warned the Texas transmission network -- though in far better shape than 
California's struggling system -- was nevertheless in dire need of upgrades, 
and lumped it together with other potential hot spots like New England and 
New York City.

``There are some bottlenecks. By expanding existing lines and building new 
ones we hope to relieve some of these bottlenecks,'' Cullick said.

Under the agreement with Columbus, Ohio-based AEP, LCRA will own the new 
lines and AEP will maintain them. This will effectively lower the program's 
cost since LCRA is a public, not-for-profit power company exempt from federal 
income tax.

On the camping note, I am researching alternative sites just in case the
weather is insane this weekend.  Depending on which weather forecast you
believe, it will be cloudy with a chance of rain, with lows in the 40s and
highs in the 50s.

I also have to check for trail closures.  Even if it's not raining, some
trails will close down if they are muddy & wet because of erosion.

No matter what, we're on for camping, though!!  Even if I have to ride my
bike in circles around the tent.

Won't be the same without you.  After all, it was Richard that came up with
"Sometimes you kick wood...sometimes the wood kicks you."

Drew:

Here is the ERCOT document that lays out the requirements for Qualification.  
We have the XML servers installed but keep in mind that any new resource 
would have to have its connection made to us.  Lloyd can explain the nuts and 
bolts but he has told me that this could take a month or 2 because 
contractors have to lay physical phone lines to each facility, and then 
connection and configuration would have to be done before any test is 
scheduled with ERCOT.  

 At this time ERCOT is very skittish about giving a hard test date because 
they claim the market start will use up all the resources they have for 
that.  They claim they may have to hold off test for later this year but they 
have been working well with us so far.  It may not be as bad as they say.   
Personally I think that by the time we get through the structure, the 
attorneys and leg work to do a deal June 1 would already be here.  This does 
not include the test phase.  I don't see how we could move that fast with all 
the limits put on us but I would like to be proven wrong because more 
resources would be good for business.

We should keep in mind that this is still a pilot program and is still very 
much a test bed for the real thing next year.   There is nothing wrong with 
pursuing resource customers and bringing them online this fall for the Jan 
start of the full open market if that is what we have to do.

Regards,


Smith

With this revision, one of the Traders would rotate onto relief for a month 
at the time.  Monday through Friday unless shift coverage becomes necessary.  
Also, this shift would require five Traders at all times.

Lemme put it another way.  If we don't go camping, I will be painting a
bedroom and re-staining kitchen cabinets.  The icing on the cake will be the
dippy girl's parents' Christmas party on Sunday.

Cold and rain creates relatively little fear for me.
