Karen,

I just wanted to confirm that you received my resume OK.  I just noticed that I  replied to your EGM message you sent out yesterday instead of your ENA Trading Track message that I received Friday.  I just wanted to make sure that you didn't accidentally overlook it due to the wrong subject header.


Thanks,

Charlie

Subject:	Update of Fuel Oil Analysis

Team,

Late last week, we were asked to provide a fuel oil specification sheet so fuel could be scheduled for the Site at Ft. Pierce.  The issue, currently, is we have three different specifications given to us over the past few months and are unsure which is correct.  The resolution:  we are reviewing the specifications from the air permit and specifications given to us from Mitsubishi to determine the minimum requirements, for the fuel, which we must meet for the air permit and gas turbine generator.  We anticipate this review process to be complete by the middle of this week.  If there are any questions, please feel free to contact me at 68258.

Thank you,

Matthew Tezyk

Soma,

Per your request, I've calculated a Houston Area notional swap price for 6/01 through 12/04.  I used  the IF-Katy mid curve as of today's close and have not adjusted for any injection or withdrawal charges that may need to be accounted for in your analysis.  If you need any further help, please let me know.


Thanks,

Charlie Weldon

Greetings,

The folks who are getting this e-mail include state editors, some folks
who have been following the web site closely, and recent posters to our
current message board.

I need your help testing out a new section of the GOPUSA.com web site,
and I hope you will participate.

In the past, GOPUSA.com has not made the proper effort that it should in
promoting its message board.  This is unfortunate, and it's about to
change.  If you notice, despite the fact that GOPUSA.com has not
promoted the board at all, it has received a number of posting over the
last several months.

Now, in our effort to really build a GOPUSA community, we are completely
redesigning the message board!  The new message board is called the
GOPUSA.com Forum.  It uses much better software than we had before, and
it is much more versatile:

* Users will actually register and be assigned a password.  This
password will be sent to them so that e-mail addresses can't be bogus.
The users e-mail address, however, does not have to appear on his/her
posts.
* There is a personal message section on the board in which a registered
user can leave a message for another registered user.
* There is an Announcements section where GOPUSA.com can post new news
and information.
* There are varying levels of "members" depending on how many posts a
user has made.
* There are icons incorporated on the board for many symbols.
* There is a lot more as well...

So, what we need to do is thoroughly test out the board.  My plan is to
launch it with an announcement in the Monday morning edition of the
Eagle.  So we need to do as much testing as we can this week.  Then,
late Saturday or Sunday, I'll clean out all the test messages, and open
it up to you guys to start posting real messages.

Here's what I'd like you to do:

* Go to the GOPUSA.com Forum at
http://gopusa.com/cgi-bin/ikonboard/ikonboard.pl
* Register with the Forum
* You'll get a password which you can easily change to a different
password in your "profile"
* Make some posts to the existing topics.  These posts don't have to be
related to the topic.  We're simply testing at this point.  The post
can, however, contain your opinions about the board, etc.
* Please e-mail me if you can participate in the testing.
* Please e-mail me (and post to the board) your ideas on topics.  A
could place for comparison is http://www.freerepublic.com
* Consider the idea on having state specific categories (a California
section, etc.) or just general categories like I have now.  Please give
me your thoughts on this.
* Test out all the features you can on the board.  If you see graphics
that don't "fit" with the layout, please let me know.  I'm customizing
the graphics to fit the GOPUSA.com theme, but I haven't changed all of
them yet.
* Don't comment on the fact that the links aren't working on the general
GOPUSA.com page that contains the Forum.  This is just a template of the
new layout, and it will be working Monday.

Thank you so much for your help on this.  Time is of the essence, and I
apologize for the late start on this.  It was not the orignial plan.  We
are going to make a big effort to build a GOPUSA community, and I know
the Forum will play a large role.

Take care, and please let me know if you have any questions.

Bobby

Doug,

This note is just to confirm my voicemail message this morning  indicating that the charges for the Fuel Oil sample check for vanadium should be charged to Co# 0413, RC # 106230.  According to the spec sheet I have, the ASTM method for vanadium is D3605 and the units of measurement are ppm (wt).

Again, I appreciate your patience in this frustrating issue.


Charlie

Subject:	Ft Pierce


A couple of quick questions about the truck deliveries to the H. D. King Power plant location:

1) Do the delivering trucks need to have their own pumps?   Trucks need pumps.
2) What size lines are the trucks pumping into? 3"?     3"
3) When connecting to our lines do the trucks need anything other than standard fittings?    Standard or 3 inch disconnects

Outstanding issues:

1) Full spec sheet--especially sodium and potassium guarantees    The environmental specs are known but the specs on the turbine itself from Mitsubishi (MHI) are not known.  We cannot determine the final specs unitl the MHI requirements are known.
2) After the initial tank fill delivery availability 24 hours/day and weekends?  Always someone at plant. Can take delivery 24/7.
3) Tank fill and beyond--why not the full 1MM gallons?  Need 200K gallons to replace previously burned oil only.
4) Dyed/non dyed fuel issue--tax evaluating   Dyed
5) Identify previous diesel supplier to the plant   Coastal was previous supplier
6) Design a fuel resupply plan including prepurchase of fuel, call on transportation, buy diesel calls for expected outage periods
7) Buyer of record and credit issues with suppliers   FPUA is buyer of record
8) Tank fill price--fixed or floating? (Platt's, NYMEX, OPIS, rack price)  
9) Commercial start date of plan     Tank to be ready on 5/15/2001
10) Any other issue to be discussed

The following basic assumptions concerning gas capacity requirements for the Fort Pierce project were confirmed today at a meeting attended by Dave Fairley, Ed McMichael, Ruth Concannon, Mark Breese, Eric Boyt, and Charlie Weldon.   (NOTE:  The heat rates and MW are subject to change pending final engineering evaluation.  The intent of this note is to document the overall runtime assumptions.)

1) During the summertime months of May through September, the plant is expected to run 16 hours per day in a mode where  Enron's 200 MW are dispatched as are Ft. Pierce's 82MW.

2)  Enron will purchase summertime capacity only sufficient to allow running 200 MW for 16 hours per day at our "bought-down" heat rate of 6690.  This equals 22,300 MMBTU/day and will allow for taking the full daily capacity in only a 16 hour period (6% per hour)  The table below summarizes the monthly capacity requirements:



   MONTH	Total Capacity Needed By Enron	Ft. Pierce Capacity (from FGU)	Phase VI Capacity 	Capacity From East Desk	
May	22,300	0	22,300	0	
June	22,300	0	22,300	0	
July	22,300	0	22,300	0	
August	22,300	0	22,300	0	
September	22,300	0	22,300	0	


  NTOE:  Prior to Phase VI completion, the project will purchase capacity from the East Desk.

3)  Ft. Pierce will use its existing FT via FGU to secure its gas requirements at the 9500 contractual heat rate for the 16 hours it is dispatched in the summer.

4)  For the winter months of October through April, the plant is expected to run 16 hours per day in a mode where Ft. Pierce is not dispatched, thus leaving Enron with 282MW at the overall plant heat rate of 7500.  This equates to 35,251 MMBTU/day and allows for taking the full capacity in only 16 hours (6% per hour)

5)  Because Ft. Pierce will not be dispatched during the winter, their unused capacity via FGU will be available for Enron.  These amounts differ by month as summarized in the table below.

6) Enron will purchase wintertime capacity only sufficient to allow running 282 MW for 16 hours per day at a 7500 heat rate, less the monthly capacities available from Ft. Pierce via FGU.  These non-FGU purchased quantities will come from the Phase VI capacity and the East Desk as shown below:




	

   MONTH	Total Capacity Needed By Enron	Ft. Pierce Capacity (from FGU)	Phase VI Capacity (Nov-Mar = 28% of Summer)	Capacity From East Desk	
October	35,251	14,665	22,300	0	
November	35,251	14,595	6,244	14,412	
December	35,251	14,895	6,244	14,112	
January	35,251	16,547	6,244	12,460	
February	35,251	15,317	6,244	13,690	
March	35,251	15,317	6,244	13,690	
April	35,251	15,317	22,300	0	


NOTE:  Prior to Phase VI completion , the project will purchase capacity from the East Desk.

7)  Backup documentation supporting the hourly gas requirement in each dispatch mode is attached to this memo.

Charlie - 

I am in an off site vendor meeting this morning and hope to be in the office later this afternoon.  Unfortunately, I am out of town on Friday (I am actually headed to Austin for a visit).  But could perhaps do something Monday morning, if I can't get to the office in time this afternoon.  Let me know your availability.  Thanks so much.

Kim,

The NGI daily prices got messed up somehow when I ran the data fetch program.  I updated them in this file now but I figured you would use GDD prices anyway.  I have also attached the NGI monthly index which is usually the way we use NGI prices, as you indicated.  I just thought you wanted daily prices originally and wanted to show them from the 3 different sources for comparison.  Sorry for the confusion.

Let me know if you need any more assistance.


Thanks,

Charlie

The following response from Doug is intended to address the issue of whether or not the sample taken was representative of what we would expect to recieve in Florida.....per the discussion of such matter in our meeting.

This sample tested by Saybolt was from a shore tank of low sulfur diesel (Colonial 74 grade) in a major's tank in the Houston area. This is representative of the low sulfur diesel that would be shipped to Florida. Fax is on it's way. Any questions call me at x35007.

Fax is 646-3460.  A couple folks wanted to know where this sample was taken from.  I told them that I was not exactly sure but was confident that the sample would be representative of the fuel oil that would be delivered in Florida, per our conversation.


Thanks again,

Why are energy stocks down so much today?  My only guess is because outlook for NG prices is lower...follows your theory of our price being proportional to NG price.

Guys,,

I thought I would just let you know that the latest indicative gas price for the Stagecoach deal is ~$4.62.  That's down ~$0.20 in the last 9 trading days.

How about an update from yall's end on the status of the negotiations, etc?


Thanks,

Charlie

Enron Avg = 90 injected
Industry avg = 86 injected
I-Bank Avg = ~72 injected (they should stick to banking)

My number is 88.

I think the market has already built in a 90 or less number.

Attached is the latest pricing as of Friday's close for the Stagecoach deal.  Load factors have been adjusted per your request to give a 50% minimum.
The new indicative price, applying spreads from previous quotes, is now $4.82.   (Note that the market is off significantly today so this quote will likely be a few pennies higher than one you would get in the live market right now)

Thanks,

Charlie

Charlie,  I just wanted to say thanks for coming down to watch the kids
even though both of the games were cancelled.  It meant a lot that
you'll made the attempt.  We really enjoyed having you and I hope we can
continue to get together on a more regular basis without the rest of the
world with us.  It is nice for Melissa and I to have time to visit and
it is nice for the kids to get to know each other and to have a
relationship.  I am going to teach Blake how to wrap his legs around my
waist when I carry him - I am looking forward to the birth of my
nephew.  Love, Margaret

Doug,

Thanks for the info.  I have passed it along.

I have one more question regarding heating values.  Do you know what the LHV and HHV values are for #2 and jet fuel?  I figure those are parameters that are measured and known but they weren't on the spec sheet.  


Thanks,

Charlie

Subject:	Ft. Pierce Gas Capacity Assumptions

The following basic assumptions concerning gas capacity requirements for the Fort Pierce project were confirmed today at a meeting attended by Dave Fairley, Ed McMichael, Ruth Concannon, Mark Breese, Eric Boyt, and Charlie Weldon.   (NOTE:  The heat rates and MW are subject to change pending final engineering evaluation.  The intent of this note is to document the overall runtime assumptions.)

1) During the summertime months of May through September, the plant is expected to run 16 hours per day in a mode where  Enron's 200 MW are dispatched as are Ft. Pierce's 82MW.

2)  Enron will purchase summertime capacity only sufficient to allow running 200 MW for 16 hours per day at our "bought-down" heat rate of 6690.  This equals 22,300 MMBTU/day and will allow for taking the full daily capacity in only a 16 hour period (6% per hour)  The table below summarizes the monthly capacity requirements:



   MONTH	Total Capacity Needed By Enron	Ft. Pierce Capacity (from FGU)	Phase VI Capacity 	Capacity From East Desk	
May	22,300	0	22,300	0	
June	22,300	0	22,300	0	
July	22,300	0	22,300	0	
August	22,300	0	22,300	0	
September	22,300	0	22,300	0	


  NTOE:  Prior to Phase VI completion, the project will purchase capacity from the East Desk.

3)  Ft. Pierce will use its existing FT via FGU to secure its gas requirements at the 9500 contractual heat rate for the 16 hours it is dispatched in the summer.

4)  For the winter months of October through April, the plant is expected to run 16 hours per day in a mode where Ft. Pierce is not dispatched, thus leaving Enron with 282MW at the overall plant heat rate of 7500.  This equates to 35,251 MMBTU/day and allows for taking the full capacity in only 16 hours (6% per hour)

5)  Because Ft. Pierce will not be dispatched during the winter, their unused capacity via FGU will be available for Enron.  These amounts differ by month as summarized in the table below.

6) Enron will purchase wintertime capacity only sufficient to allow running 282 MW for 16 hours per day at a 7500 heat rate, less the monthly capacities available from Ft. Pierce via FGU.  These non-FGU purchased quantities will come from the Phase VI capacity and the East Desk as shown below:




	

   MONTH	Total Capacity Needed By Enron	Ft. Pierce Capacity (from FGU)	Phase VI Capacity (Nov-Mar = 28% of Summer)	Capacity From East Desk	
October	35,251	14,665	22,300	0	
November	35,251	14,595	6,244	14,412	
December	35,251	14,895	6,244	14,112	
January	35,251	16,547	6,244	12,460	
February	35,251	15,317	6,244	13,690	
March	35,251	15,317	6,244	13,690	
April	35,251	15,317	22,300	0	


NOTE:  Prior to Phase VI completion , the project will purchase capacity from the East Desk.

7)  Backup documentation supporting the hourly gas requirement in each dispatch mode is attached to this memo.

We had a very comfortable and open exchange of information regarding her work experience and views on current business topics.  She is well-seasoned in dealing with complex business issues and would very likely be ahead of many of her fellow students.  She exudes confidence yet remains open to new ideas and ways of thinking.  I have no reservation in saying that Suzette would flourish at UT and contribute significantly to the overall quality of the class.


Do you believe this candidate is a good match for the culture and strengths of the TEXASMBA program? Please elaborate on any reservations you may have. 

Suzette is definitely a good match for the Texas MBA program.  She is a high energy, very results-oriented individual with a tremendous track record of successful accomplishments.  Her personality is very conducive to working in a diverse team environment and I see no issue that would prevent her from being a top-notch MBA student at UT.

Charlie,  I just wanted to say thanks for coming down to watch the kids
even though both of the games were cancelled.  It meant a lot that
you'll made the attempt.  We really enjoyed having you and I hope we can
continue to get together on a more regular basis without the rest of the
world with us.  It is nice for Melissa and I to have time to visit and
it is nice for the kids to get to know each other and to have a
relationship.  I am going to teach Blake how to wrap his legs around my
waist when I carry him - I am looking forward to the birth of my
nephew.  Love, Margaret

Matt,

Thank you very much for the info.  I have forwarded the specs on to Doug Leach who will be responsible for ordering the fuel oil.  I asked him to identify any spec parameters that are not readily attainable with commercially available #2 Fuel Oil.  For example, I'm fairly certain that 0.0% ash is not normally available.  I have also asked him  to provide information on what grades of fuel oil are available that we should consider.   I will forward any feedback that I receive from Doug to you so we can then have the team determine how best to proceed from that point.

Thanks again for all your help.

Charlie

Charles,

	Attached below is the fuel oil specification.  Our Engineering group has reviewed all Vendor and Air Permit requirements, and the sheet labeled "Fuel Oil Spec" is the fuel oil specification.  The sheet labeled "Comparison Specs" is the other data you requested for comparison.  When using the fuel oil specification to purchase fuel, please have the vendors provide the following information:

Density at reference temperature
Heating Values at reference temperature
Maximum trace contaminant limits:
	chromium
	arsenic
	siloxenes
	copper corrosivity
	cetane index
	cetane number

Thank you,

Matt

Subject:	Re: Fuel Specification Requirements   

Matt-

I talked with Bill Fox and Doug Ottens concerning the fuel spec.  In order for MHI to meet the particulate emissions, we must provide a fuel oil with no ash.  Additionally, vanadium is a catalyst poison, so to meet the CMI needs, I reduced the vanadium.

I am attaching a revised fuel oil spec matrix, which has four fuel specs included.  The first column meets the minimum requirements of MHI & CMI.  The second column holds the ash at the low value, but allows the vanadium to increase.  The third column holds the low vanadium value, but allows the ash to increase.  The last column allow both the ash and vanadium to increase.

ENA will need to get bids for column 1 and may want to solicit bids for column 2, 3, & 4 for economic comparison purposes.

Ray

Bill,

I understand that you are the contact person for MHI concerning the ash spec for the 501F turbine being used on the Ft. Pierce project.  I have been working with Matt Tezyk to finalize all issues concerning this fuel oil spec. Please let me know as soon as possible what the MHI response is regarding the inability to get 0% ash fuel oil.   We are trying to get closure on this issue so we can order the fuel oil to replace that which we caused FPUA to burn to begin construction on the site.

Thanks!

Charlie Weldon

Doug,

Attached is the (long-awaited) spec for the 200K gallons of low-sulphur #2 Fuel Oil to partially refill the tank at the Ft. Pierce facility in Florida.
As the attached note describes, the final spec is a result of the combined spec requirements by the environmental permit, MHI (Mitsubishi), and Engineering.

We currently believe that some of these specs may be more stringent than what is commercially available.  In the event that some of these specs are too stringent, we would like you to: 1) identify which specs are not reasonably attainable, and 2) suggest what value of these specs are attainable.   Your feedback will be shared with the appropriate parties and, assuming there are spec change recommendations, these parties will determine how best to proceed.  

Please note that the first attached note requests than any bids we get contain info on density, heating value, and trace contaminants.  Additionally, the second attached note references getting multiple bids for different specs.  I suggest that, for now, we resolve the spec issue internally as described above and then we obtain quotes.   If you have any other suggestions on how best to proceed, your input is welcome.

Your assistance in this matter is, and has been, greatly appreciated.


Thanks,

Charlie Weldon

Charles,

	Attached below is the fuel oil specification.  Our Engineering group has reviewed all Vendor and Air Permit requirements, and the sheet labeled "Fuel Oil Spec" is the fuel oil specification.  The sheet labeled "Comparison Specs" is the other data you requested for comparison.  When using the fuel oil specification to purchase fuel, please have the vendors provide the following information:

Density at reference temperature
Heating Values at reference temperature
Maximum trace contaminant limits:
	chromium
	arsenic
	siloxenes
	copper corrosivity
	cetane index
	cetane number

Thank you,

Matt

Subject:	Re: Fuel Specification Requirements   

Matt-

I talked with Bill Fox and Doug Ottens concerning the fuel spec.  In order for MHI to meet the particulate emissions, we must provide a fuel oil with no ash.  Additionally, vanadium is a catalyst poison, so to meet the CMI needs, I reduced the vanadium.

I am attaching a revised fuel oil spec matrix, which has four fuel specs included.  The first column meets the minimum requirements of MHI & CMI.  The second column holds the ash at the low value, but allows the vanadium to increase.  The third column holds the low vanadium value, but allows the ash to increase.  The last column allow both the ash and vanadium to increase.

ENA will need to get bids for column 1 and may want to solicit bids for column 2, 3, & 4 for economic comparison purposes.

Ray

UT Id (SSN): 
Visit Location:  Houston
Visit Date:  4/30/01




Trait Description	Rating (1 through 4)	Comments                                                                                              	
                              	 	 	
Communication Skills    	         1	Very strong and effective communicator.	
Poise / Confidence    	         1	No problem here.  Suzette is quite confident without being cocky.	
Leadership Potential   	         1	 It is very easy to imagine Suzette in a leadership role.	
Personality / Enthusiasm    	         1	Very energetic and ascited about the possibility of being   a Texas MBA student.	
Maturity    	         2	She should not have any problem mixing with older, more-experienced students.	
Clarity of Professional Focus    	         2	Seems very focused on the potential opportunities following receiving an MBA degree, but is still open-minded. 	


Please provide the Admission Committee with a brief narrative overview of your AdmissionVisit dialogue. You may use this opportunity to elaborate further on the above rankings. 

We had a very comfortable and open exchange of information regarding her work experience and views on current business topics.  She is well-seasoned in dealing with complex business issues and would very likely be ahead of many of her fellow students.  She exudes confidence yet remains open to new ideas and ways of thinking.  I have no reservation in saying that Suzette would flourish at UT and contribute significantly to the overall quality of the class.


Do you believe this candidate is a good match for the culture and strengths of the TEXASMBA program? Please elaborate on any reservations you may have. 

Suzette is definitely a good match for the Texas MBA program.  She is a high energy, very results-oriented individual with a tremendous track record of successful accomplishments.  Her personality is very conducive to working in a diverse team environment and I see no issue that would prevent her from being a top-notch MBA student at UT.

Mike,

I noticed that your name was not on the distribution list for these exchanges so I am forwarding them to you to catch you up.  I have faxed the #2 Diesel Fuel specs along with those for jet fuel to Matt Tezyk who has been coordinating the effort to consolidate the spec.  He said he would share these with all the riight parties so the decision can be made as to whether we decide to take regular low-sulphur #2, jet fuel, or pursue some other path.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Charlie Weldon

Subject:	Re: Fuel Specification Requirements   

Yesterday I faxed a copy of Colonial Pipeline's specifications for fungible low sulfur diesel fuel (74 grade) to Mark Breese. That spec sheet is indicative of the specs for low sulfur diesel in Florida. It must be remembered that Florida has no refineries nor product pipelines and receives their fuel via barges and vessels from domestic and international refineries and terminals. Will forward Colonial jet fuel (54 grade) specs.

Subject:	Re: Fuel Specification Requirements

Doug,

Attached is the (long-awaited) spec for the 200K gallons of low-sulphur #2 Fuel Oil to partially refill the tank at the Ft. Pierce facility in Florida.
As the attached note describes, the final spec is a result of the combined spec requirements by the environmental permit, MHI (Mitsubishi), and Engineering.

We currently believe that some of these specs may be more stringent than what is commercially available.  In the event that some of these specs are too stringent, we would like you to: 1) identify which specs are not reasonably attainable, and 2) suggest what value of these specs are attainable.   Your feedback will be shared with the appropriate parties and, assuming there are spec change recommendations, these parties will determine how best to proceed.  

Please note that the first attached note requests than any bids we get contain info on density, heating value, and trace contaminants.  Additionally, the second attached note references getting multiple bids for different specs.  I suggest that, for now, we resolve the spec issue internally as described above and then we obtain quotes.   If you have any other suggestions on how best to proceed, your input is welcome.

Your assistance in this matter is, and has been, greatly appreciated.


Thanks,

Charlie Weldon

Charles,

	Attached below is the fuel oil specification.  Our Engineering group has reviewed all Vendor and Air Permit requirements, and the sheet labeled "Fuel Oil Spec" is the fuel oil specification.  The sheet labeled "Comparison Specs" is the other data you requested for comparison.  When using the fuel oil specification to purchase fuel, please have the vendors provide the following information:

Density at reference temperature
Heating Values at reference temperature
Maximum trace contaminant limits:
	chromium
	arsenic
	siloxenes
	copper corrosivity
	cetane index
	cetane number

Thank you,

Matt

Subject:	Re: Fuel Specification Requirements   

Matt-

I talked with Bill Fox and Doug Ottens concerning the fuel spec.  In order for MHI to meet the particulate emissions, we must provide a fuel oil with no ash.  Additionally, vanadium is a catalyst poison, so to meet the CMI needs, I reduced the vanadium.

I am attaching a revised fuel oil spec matrix, which has four fuel specs included.  The first column meets the minimum requirements of MHI & CMI.  The second column holds the ash at the low value, but allows the vanadium to increase.  The third column holds the low vanadium value, but allows the ash to increase.  The last column allow both the ash and vanadium to increase.

ENA will need to get bids for column 1 and may want to solicit bids for column 2, 3, & 4 for economic comparison purposes.

Ray

Hey Charlie,

I responded to your cweldon@houston.rr.com <mailto:cweldon@houston.rr.com>
address yesterday and it came back undeliverable...not sure what is up but
anyway...

How's everything going with you and the family? How is Melissa feeling? Mom
said they had a great time visiting with everyone over Easter weekend. I am
sorry we could not be there. How was your Easter? We had probably the best
set of Holy Week services we have ever had.

How is work going? Are you still having to put in quite a few more hours
these days?

My job is going well. I am starting to settle a bit into my new position,
but am still working through some transition issues from my old position. I
think that I will like doing this new job quite a bit. I have good people to
work with. Our church band is really starting to come together...I am really
excited. We are hoping to have a concert on May 19th or June 2nd (depending
on a business trip I may or may not need to take). Mom and Dad are coming up
to see the concert. You all had talked about coming up sometime in the
spring...do you have any dates in mind?

Well, I've got to run...I have bonuses to calculate and a meeting to get
ready for. You all take care...give Melissa and Hunter a hug from all of us.

All our love...stayton

P.S. What is your take on TI these days? I am planning on getting some more
Enron stock soon and want to know if you are still high on TI...slpj

Bill,

I understand that you are the contact person for MHI concerning the ash spec for the 501F turbine being used on the Ft. Pierce project.  I have been working with Matt Tezyk to finalize all issues concerning this fuel oil spec. Please let me know as soon as possible what the MHI response is regarding the inability to get 0% ash fuel oil.   We are trying to get closure on this issue so we can order the fuel oil to replace that which we caused FPUA to burn to begin construction on the site.

Thanks!

Charlie Weldon

We had a very comfortable and open exchange of information regarding her work experience and views on current business topics.  She is well-seasoned in dealing with complex business issues and would very likely be ahead of many of her fellow students.  She exudes confidence yet remains open to new ideas and ways of thinking.  I have no reservation in saying that Suzette would flourish at UT and contribute significantly to the overall quality of the class.


Do you believe this candidate is a good match for the culture and strengths of the TEXASMBA program? Please elaborate on any reservations you may have. 

Suzette is definitely a good match for the Texas MBA program.  She is a high energy, very results-oriented individual with a tremendous track record of successful accomplishments.  Her personality is very conducive to working in a diverse team environment and I see no issue that would prevent her from being a top-notch MBA student at UT.

Guys,,

I thought I would just let you know that the latest indicative gas price for the Stagecoach deal is ~$4.62.  That's down ~$0.20 in the last 9 trading days.

How about an update from yall's end on the status of the negotiations, etc?


Thanks,

The following response from Doug is intended to address the issue of whether or not the sample taken was representative of what we would expect to recieve in Florida.....per the discussion of such matter in our meeting.

Interesting article on ENE (although I don't agree with some points).

We are going to talk with Shankman tomorrow and so was wondering if you could refresh the prices for the collars in the attached file.  Fairly similar to what we priced yesterday, but we only have 2 volume increments.  Also, we need to price this as an annual deal with 1 exercise at the end of each calendar year.  (2010 would be exercised on 12/31/2010).  Also, we need to refresh the fixed price quotes on the last sheet in the attached file as well.  These prices I asked John Griffith about last friday.  Use tonights close if you don't mind.

Please let me know if you have any questions,  

Thanks again,

eric

HHV is not the proper terminology, Gross Heat of Combustion is. The following is for Light diesel. First number is min, second is max. Jet fuel should be in the same ballpark as Light Diesel. Gross Heat of Combustion is about 6.4% higher than Net Heat of Combustion (incorrectly referred to as LHV), so divide the Gross numbers by 1.064 to obtain Net numbers. 

Gross Heat of Combustion, Kcal/Kg	D-240 or D-4868	10,820	10,966	
Gross Heat of Combustion, BTU/Lbs	D-240 or D-4868	19,520	19,780

Doug,

Thanks for the info.  I have passed it along.

I have one more question regarding heating values.  Do you know what the LHV and HHV values are for #2 and jet fuel?  I figure those are parameters that are measured and known but they weren't on the spec sheet.  


Thanks,

Charlie

We'll be there Friday night and plan to spend the night.  If Elizabeth would rather spend the night with her friend, that's fine.  Hunter can play with Travis that night and be plenty happy.

Per our conversation, I recommend using Tetco M3 plus the avg seasonal basis to Alg CG (Summer =~0, Winter =~.10)  Note the volatility in these that I graphed.  This volatility willl likely need to be taken into account in your model if/when you get to that level of detail.

Our "spec" is <.05 ppm.  I talked to Doug about whether or not the measurement can be made to a greater degree of accuracy.  We believe it is not but Doug said he would provide us with a contact to call concerning the vanadium measurement accuracy.  I'm still waiting on that contact name and number.  The thought here was to have this contact discuss the iissue first-hand with the engineering team so a judgement can be made.

Thanks,

Charlie

Doug,

This note is just to confirm my voicemail message this morning  indicating that the charges for the Fuel Oil sample check for vanadium should be charged to Co# 0413, RC # 106230.  According to the spec sheet I have, the ASTM method for vanadium is D3605 and the units of measurement are ppm (wt).

Again, I appreciate your patience in this frustrating issue.

Hi Jay,

Please find the attached file. It has two more tabs for the two regressions, one replacing the holes in the data(reg-wo-hole) and one with manipulation in the holes of the data (Regression-w-hole). Both the regressions suggest similar results. The graph shows regression output. We might want to try only the winter data if that is what you are looking for. Or, we may also put the restriction on the regression that the gas consumption cannot go down beyond 5000 (to take care of negative estimates).

Let me know what you think and I would be happy to do the further analyses.

Thanks
