Subject: Re: Barcelona  

D Weekes is working with Tim P-P to address the resulting questions and 
should have a briefing memo together for distribution tomorrow.  We will 
follow up to answer Rick's questions at that time.  The major 
issues/questions are still a bit fluid since this just surfaced but  
presently include the following:

Issues/Questions
Exposure - Spread sheets in Liquids and CAS show dramatically different 
exposures of roughly US$ 68 MM (peak, now closer to $ 47 MM) for spreadsheets 
and US$ 13 MM for CAS.  I asked Tim to detail the anticipated exposure in 
coming weeks (ie. timing of cargoes in transit net of anticipated payments to 
be received).
Controls - Delayed mailing of Invoices by up to 30 days in some cases.  
Various other controls issues need to be addressed including where were the 
triggers in the system that should have flagged the issues earlier.
Legal Documentation - Why contract volumes were significantly exceeded and no 
documentation prepared to support trades once the 330k mtpy annual limit was 
breached?  The effect apparently was trades being done without contractual 
support.

Deliverables
Accelerate Feb month end payments (approx. 30 MM).
Disallow deferred payments from Muentes (up to 75 days in some instances) if 
customers are paying more quickly.  Current contract, now effectively 
expired, allows deferral of payments (1/3 each month starting with end of 
month of discharge).
Assign future A/R's directly from third parties on the other side of Muentes.
Create a lock box for future payments to avoid receiving $'s via Muentes.
Execute JV documentation that has now been outstanding for some time.

Goals - in sequential order:  reduce exposure to Muentes, paper 
non-documented transactions already done (ie. beyond volume limits of current 
contract, review mid/back office systems to avoid future problems, improve 
structure via JV or other interim steps if JV execution is still some time 
off.

D Weekes - Get with Ross Koller to make sure no new business is done with 
Muentes (beyond fulfilling new commitments).  Likewise, you or Hardy need to 
get with Tim P-P and R Quick in order to assure all are on the same page and 
agree the best way forward for this relationship.  Based on info. in hand, 
there does not appear to be an issue with Muentes' ability to perform (please 
confirm).  Therefore, care should be taken to maintain the relationship; 
however, I don't see the benefit in doing new deals with Muentes (beyond 
fulfilling current commitments) until the exposure is brought down.  Muentes 
does not appear to justify additional exposure based on my conversation with 
Hardy last week.  So, before the credit limit is reconsidered, the structure 
needs to be improved where payments bypass Muentes (via lockbox or another 
alternative) and A/R's assigned directly to ENE.  The new JV documents may 
take steps to improve the structure; however, this needs to be confirmed as 
it has been some time since the JV docs. have been circulated.

Steve I had a brief conversation with Rick today and Barcelona came up. 
My sense is that he is expecting an autopsy that answers how it happened 
(including) how the exposure ran up but didn't get flagged in the right 
places. Is somebody taking care of this ?

I neglected to get  back to you on this.  The Global Products office will 
close when Henkke Talvitie (our remaining trader) either leaves (contract 
expires Sept) or relocates to London.  Chris Mahoney tells me they are quite 
close on relocation terms.

Sally, 

Thanks for calling last night.

I've spoken to Joe Gold (MD) and James New (my Power Director) and we will be 
delighted to have Todd over for a month.

We need him here for Monday 20th March - for 4 weeks - thru 15th April. Full 
Time. 

I guess he should plan to fly over next weekend to be here for the Monday - 
bright and early. The timing is crucial.

He would work jointly with Neil Tarling (Director) on the project - basically 
- to seperate the Continental Power Book into 4/5 regional books - complete 
with individual portfolio's, fully documented inter-book trades, currency 
functionality and control gates. He will be working with Traders, Comm Supp & 
IT.

I suggest Todd touches base with James - Project 'Lead' - to get some 
backgroung information about the market.

I think the 'Sally will pay' line swung it with the Commercial folks......I 
said we had a free option - we can always send him home....

Speak to you real soon.

B.

fyi...

Ted,

As discussed, please see below an outline of the changes that we are making 
to the Logistics set-up in London. I also attach the Roles & Responsibilities 
document we discussed - I highlight in red the sections that have been agreed 
with the functional groups... 

Sally,

Sorry to have missed you this week. I hope to have the opportunity to explain 
to you in greater detail the changes we are making to the logistics function 
in Europe. We hope to replicate this model to Singapore and possibly Houston 
once we have proven the model in London.

I will also forward you a plan that we have kicked off to migrate trading 
support for the Helsinki operation back to London...

Regards,
Tim

Subject: Project "Q"

Hi,

I'd like to summarise the various discussions that have taken place over the 
last few days in relation to our forthcoming Logistics project, which I've 
tentatively named "Project Q". At some point a prize will be awarded to 
whoever can guess what the "Q" stands for...

Objective

Project "Q" has a twofold objective:

1) Implement the Co-ordination function for the London and Helsinki Global 
Trading Support group - see attached for a definition of this function 

2) Roll out the Products Inventory Management System ("PIMS") for the London 
and Helsinki Global Trading Support groups.

Target Timescale

Completion of both objectives is currently planned for the end of May. David 
and I have hastily put together a timeline which we will refine as a group at 
a Kick-Off meeting scheduled for next Friday, by which time the project team 
will be assembled in London - see attached .

To meet this tight timeframe, the scope of the project needs to be clearly 
understood especially in relation to rolling out PIMS. Though over time 1) 
functionality may be added to PIMS, 2) there will (hopefully) be a further 
deployment in Houston and Singapore, 3) an interface to RightAngle may be 
developed, 4) invoicing may be added etc... - for the purpose of this project 
the scope of the PIMS application is limited to replacing MANIPS for the 
Helsinki and London Operators (Petchems may or may not be included in this 
phase). The actual PIMS specification will be finalised next week by Graham 
and David (IT are currently mid-way through a full elaboration for the 
system).

Project Team

Steering group will comprise me (also Sponsor), Graham and Becky.

Project Manager is Cindy (arriving from Houston on Tuesday).

IT lead for PIMS is David Rae (full time for duration of project), managed by 
Iain Greig.

A Task Force comprising three contract accountants is being assembled and 
will be in place by the middle of next week.

Other stakeholders/key participants in this project are Logistics in London 
and Helsinki. The result of this project should be to leverage our existing 
operators and improve controls by introducing a second tier support around 
the Logistics function. However, for this to happen a significant 
contribution will be required from all our Operators to ensure a successful 
implementation within our timeframe.

Regards,
Tim

>From the Risk Management perspective I would like to add the following 
comments :

UK Power - despite much testing we still have a few production teething 
problems with the transfer to Enpower and this was the first full live day. 
The specific issues surrounding the o30m adjustment is being investigated by 
IT and we hope to have a definitive answer tomorrow.

Continental Power - the Portcalc valuation failed 4 times as a result of IT 
problems resulting is us missing the deadline.

Oslo - the officialisation was at 10.56 London time against a deadline of 
11.00.

Subject: DPR Adjustments for UK Power

James,

It appears only the UK Gas MTM made it for the V@R run in Houston today.

UK Power:  (despite the spotlight  being on this feed due to the first run of 
the new evaluation system) was officialised late and required the below 
mentioned adjustment.

Contintental Power : Officialised late ?

Nordic Power : was officialised around 11am London time - the slowness of the 
current feed to Houston prevented the feed reaching there on time (feed has 
been rewritten by IT to speed up the process  and is currently in UAT) 
however, it appears the normal time for officialisation this book is around 
10.30am which allows the feed to hit to normally hit on time. 

Appreciate if you could looked into the above.


Regards

David

We have a topside adjustment to put through of o(30,164,151) against South 
Western Electricity plc.  This is due to PD Deal E000535, Peer ID 41957 being 
valued in EnPower when it was supposed to be excluded from the MTM.

 I would also like a copy of the expected new deals for 2001 reflecting the 
average increase/or decrease in the PV of the Gross Book Balance.  I need 
this infomation in Dollar terms not percentages. I need to have the new deals

Subject: Various Items

1)  I just talked with Scott Earnest and asked him to send you and John 
Sherriff copies of the lastest draft of the report on Singapore.  This draft 
now incorporates comments from Bill Bradford that were pending last week (he 
made the trip to Sydney and Singapore, but had to be in New York last week, 
meaning his imput was delayed until yesterday.  You and John should receive 
those drafts today.  

2)  I sent an e:mail message to John Sherriff after you and I talked, simply 
to clarify the several purposes of my trip to London (since you said he was 
asking).  I have scheduled a brief meeting one-on-one with him while I am 
there.    

3)  To outline for you the primary points on my agenda for the week, they are 
the following:

Iron out with you the trading operations support that Brent and I can provide 
for you during this transition period
Finalize details with Tara Rozen on work permits, accomodations and all of 
the details on having support personnel in London 

Map out with you how we can provide training, orientation and contacts for 
Michael Jordan when he arrives to help make his assimilation a smooth one 
(which as you and I discussed, may involved a short stint in Houston)

Meet with you, Barry, Richard Sage and anyone else that you feel is 
appropriate to collect their ideas on working collectively on effective 
trading operations and controls world-wide

I look forward to seeing you next week.

Sally

Further to our discussion on Friday I summarise my view of Joe Gold's issues 
with the MO control process

Joe expressed some frustration with the current status as follows: -

The DPR has historically been 'filled with noise' around adjustments for 
edits on trades, provision restatements etc which negates it's effectiveness 
for him as a control/supervisory report 
The risk team appear to have been reacting to p&l 'noise'  - particularly 
around transmission adjustments rather than proactively finding booking 
solutions - or instructing IT to flex Enpower
Settlements have gained a perception in the market place for 'errors' such 
that originators are informing Joe that business is being 'lost' due to our 
perceived inability to support transactions - ( must be careful here as no 
specifics on errors have been provided )
The risk team ( post Neil Tarling's transfer to EBS ) is relatively junior 
and does not possess many 'years' of experience of Power support
James New as Power,Gas and Credit Controller has ( necessarily ) too broad a 
role for him to focus on these detailed issues

In mitigation

The recent continental book split ( which is only now being 'settled' in to 
the daily process) and the clean up of historic provisions/reserves prior to 
Neil Tarling's transfer has exaggerated the base issue around certainty of 
daily p&l
Designing an approximate booking process for transmission has not been a top 
priority for the risk team in the recent past ( this was either wrong or the 
prioritisation call  was not  effectively communicated to Joe ) - and it is 
felt that there are no IT resources to code  these solutions to Enpower ( 
also London struggles to influence Houston IT resource prioritisation )
The settlements infrastructure has been supporting a business volume growth 
it is not designed for and supporting acitivity on this platform requires 
'skilled' staff ( we are down on resources for Continental Power ) - 
continuing growth in volumes are expected along with junior settlement staff 
being asked to join Commercial groups
We are  experiencing  generational  change as a result of Barry's move to EBS 
- resourcing is James and my top priority

I believe what Joe is asking for, is what we are trying to provide - namely :

upgrade in resourcing in the risk group where we are insisting that the lead 
individual has full responsibility, end to end, for the business including 
the assessment of operational risk and effectiveness of the business process,
focus on identifying and implementing the necessary quick hit solutions that 
eliminates 'manual workarounds' and consequently 'noise' in the process
more proactive communication with Commercial - especially to manage 
expectations
a definitive plan for how the strategic upgrade in applications architecture 
for MO will benefit/change his business support

However, we are behind in finding the 'right' replacement for Neil ( one with 
experience and breadth of view potential ), we have found a continental power 
settlemetns manager but he does not arrive until July 3 rd, we have been 
struggling with book split when that should have been completed a month ago 
and it is taking time to get all the ducks lined up re our plans for 
Enlighten/DTL/EnVoice/Autoconfirms/DCAF - hence his frustration about lost 
business opportunities NOW!!

Hence I would love to find someone who could deliver the above ( ie be Neil 
Tarling's replacement ) or could assist us in
providing and communicating the judgement calls on transmission and other 
adjustments - so improving perception of C.P. DPR
prioritising and influencing Enpower development agenda ( along with others )
project manage issues around 'unstable' documentation and settlement process 
vis a vis client sensitivity
provide leadership in changing expectations/perceptions

I'm sorry for the length of the note but it may help you in determining a 
'best fit' person 

Please call if any of the above is unclear.

Mike

We may have been overtaken by events - I spoke to Sally today on this, GCP 
and operational cost model

Apologies for the cancelled meeting - I wanted Steve to be there and he is 
sick - but I will call after Sally has had a chance to brief you on today's 
conversations

regards - and thanks for the message

Subject: Global Rates

I thought I would share with you my ideas in regard to my upcoming trip to 
London.

I would like to meet with you and James New for about an hour when I first 
arrive to get a feel of your businesses and to give both of you an update on 
the new and improved Global Rates Group.   I would also appreciate it if I 
could unobtrusively sit with several of your risk groups in order to among 
other things, get an idea of the types of commodities London trades and their 
respective Exchanges and to become familiar with the current process that 
London uses to capture commodity rates.  

After a couple of days, I am confident that I could have an idea of how 
Global Rates could be of the most benefit to London.

This trip would of course be charged to the Global Rates CC and not allocated 
back to London, since it is a "discovery"  trip, which we have budgeted for 
in our 2001 budget.

I wouldn't want this to interfere in anyway with your ongoing business, 
therefore would you please let me know when you and James would be in London 
during the next couple of  weeks and I will schedule my trip accordingly.

Thanks again for your assistance, it is unfortunate that our teleconference 
scheduled for today got cancelled.

ISSUE

The Physical metals business implemented an Off Balance Sheet Structure=20
(OBSF) pre year-end to meet Enron requirements for gearing ratios.

Whilst this does not present undue problems for LME warrants, these being=
=20
bearer documents, it does present an issue when physical metal, the value o=
f=20
which depends upon brand and location, is placed into the facility. Given t=
he=20
hard deadline of year-end the operational support of this process initially=
=20
took place on spreadsheets.

The impact of the OBSF on the operational side of the physical business=20
should not be underestimated. The process of moving material off and on=20
balance sheet places considerable strain from trading through to settlement=
s,=20
particularly when there is an absence of necessary control functionality in=
=20
the AS400. With the specified functionality it is believed that all=20
operational and trading issues arising from OBSF can be managed=20
satisfactorily.

The core functionality, which was due prior to the year-end, was released=
=20
during January but was subsequently found to have introduced =01+bugs=01, t=

integrated business control processes. Whilst an improvement on having no=

the control environment, compounded by the fact that IT can not provide a=
=20
guaranteed delivery for the =01+bug=01, fixes and non core =01,reporting=01=

functionality.

This has given rise to the following concerns:

? There are insufficient experienced resources to fully reconcile stock at =
a=20
brand & location level to coordination records (the global position is=20
reconciled however).
? It is not possible to substantiate the DPR for EM&CL as:
? a) P&L on spread moves from Cash to 3 months positions (and related cash =
to=20
3 months provisions) can not be produced by the system and must be estimate=
d,=20
and
? b) System bugs have created uncertainties over trial balance values.

These concerns are compounded by the following:

? The most experienced AS400 IT developer for the EM&CL business has=20
resigned. He is currently working his 6 months notice which will expire in=

July 2001.
? The most experienced AS400 IT developer on the EML side of the business h=

also resigned. He left in January 2001.=20
? There is no documentation for the AS400. It is therefore difficult for=20

Conclusion

It is essential that we do not become hostages to the development of the=20

Sally / Brent

Sensitivity in both FO and Risk Management Control around the acurracy of p&l 
and risk post the recent continental book split placed an additional ( & 
necessary) 'manual' step within our reporting process. As we have progressed 
the book split we anticipate a return to normal service

Clearly we will watch closely to ensure this meets Houston requirements

Officialisation for the 31st of May DPR was made around 3pm for both the 
Bilateral and the Pool books.

Officialisation for the 30th was not done due to book running problems which 
resulted in the DPR only being completed at 11pm.

The last V@R calculation was made on the 26th due to book split problems. The 
V@R for the 31st will be run today.

I discussed the work permit issue with the UK and they agree we need to apply 
as quickly as possible - especially for you, Brent, as it usually takes 4 
weeks.  Please complete this form as quickly as possible (Brent, for you 
today would be great!) and email to Tara Rozen.  They can then file on 
Friday.  If the permit is not in by April 1, we suggest you arrive without 
your family until the permit is approved.

We will from Monday the 18th be providing a flash P&L to Houston on a t+1 
basis. This will be sent by 12.30 London time to the Global consolidation 
team. Initially we will aim to produce a total book by book P&L number with 
brief commentary as necessary depending on the daily move. As system and 
process changes and improvements allow we will work towards providing 
positions, VAR, P&L decomposition etc.

If there are any questions or if this is not acceptable then please can get 
back to me.

Please find attached the most recent update for Merchanting Metals.

In summary the planned systems changes and manual substantiation efforts are behind schedule. Additional resources are being allocated and the situation is being closely monitored ( both for quarter end signoff and on going operations ).

Subject:	Merchanting Metals Update #2

The intention of the efforts and actions documented in my earlier update ( see attached email ) was to provide  
a robust position signoff process for total metal tonnage, spread and brand and location
a timely substantiation of 
stock on balance sheet
forward MTM 
debtors and creditor balances
OBSF transactional values and a reconciliation of the barclays intercompany account

Despite the best efforts of IT, continuing problems with the AS400 application, a better understanding of the inconsistency between stock reconciliation reports, and concerns over the useability of the outright stock screen enquiry are such that I am currently not confident of delivering sufficient accurate information to AA to satisfy their audit requirements - which at a macro level is the transparent audit trail between stock and forward positions to full accounting values.

Consequently I need to inform you of, and/or require your approval for, the following :

I will discuss with AA the following
that OBSF values within the extended trial balance may be misstated due to data issues ( above and beyond existing conversations with AA on model simplifications)
that there are reconciling differences between trader position analyses, AS400 on screen enquiries and the formal global position report ( these differences are at present not understood but would need to be provided to AA within the audit timetable)
an outline of the internal balance sheet review process described in my earlier note which must now be reprioritised and rescoped ( see MO work )
The creation of an incentive payment pool ( possibly via personal best awards ) for key Metals staff who continue to work exceptionally unsociable hours to meet the above stated objectives
The signoff for additional permanent 'Enron' headcount who will 'duplicate' certain key position control processes ultimately replacing some existing Traffic staff
A reconciling difference of $15mm exists between the reported DPR and the final accounting p&l as generated on the AS400. We will continue to investigate potential misstatements in the system p&l, as a result of data or system valuation problems, within the month end reporting timeframe. However, this difference may need to be adjusted for following a final review and signoff of system p&l values with traders.
The recall of all OBSF stock in early April and retention on balance sheet ( reduced where economically viable ) until positions are fully reconciled and repeatable daily signoff process can be instigated.

Middle Office work being prioritised is as follows
the stock circularisation initiated for close of business 23 rd - with full reconciliation of returns to current system data by traffic/co-ordination
an audit of the stock and forward valuation report for the 30 th ( replacing planned 23 rd review due to system issues ), requiring
full download of contract detail for later reference
reconciliation of stock movements between 23 rd and 30 th
sample tests of vanilla forward transactions
detailed position analysis of all OBSF contracts that must be reconciled to Barclays documentation
spreadsheet recalculation of OBSF option premium utilising the above manually created position analysis
the circularisation of Barclays intercompany account and comparison to our cut off and substantiation analysis
the debtors/creditors partial circularisation initiated for close of business 23 rd

I will be in touch directly re the items needing approval

Regards

Mike

Subject:	Merchanting Metals update

Several related issues have resulted in an increase in the level of operating risk for the Merchanting Metals business.

Complexities surrounding the operation of the Off Balance Sheet Facility ("OBSF") which commenced two weeks before the year end.
The uncertainty generated by the revocation of AA's signoff for the facility late in the year end audit.
The discovery of a number of 'bugs' within the AS400 Merchanting code, arising from the release of OBSF designed functionality, which compounded the operational burden of supporting the OBSF.
The requirement to amend the operational process and OBSF IT code as a result of the current renegotiation of the OBSF with Barclays ( and AA ).
The senior IT developer for Merchanting has resigned and been sent on gardening leave.
The Corporate requirement to lower working capital usage for the Merchanting business irrespective of the above parochial business issues.

Various mitigating actions have been and will be taken to provide focus, gain comfort over control levels and to provide assurance to senior management as to the accuracy of the Q1 DPR and business balance sheet.

The implementation for SAP for the Merchanting business has been delayed and effectively decoupled from the higher risk ( higher benefit ) Brokerage implementation - benefit is to provide sole focus on OBSF for IT Merchanting developers.
The AR/AP SAP data quality reviews for both businesses are continuing so as to provide a detailed analysis as at end Q1.
Middle Office have instigated a new daily working capital report process tracking cash settlement/ funding data to working capital components for all Metals businesses.
An enhanced position signoff process will be implemented prior to end Q1 covering gross tonnage, spread positions and summarised analyses for brand and locations. The necessary report functionality should be available within the AS400, however contingencies have been initiated to build tactical VBA/excel reports outside of the AS400 but using AS400 data downloads.
User requests for additional AS400 functionality and reports have been aggressively prioritised and a code freeze will commence prior to the end of Q1 following the delivery of three reports determined as minimum requirements for the support of OBSF.
A resubstantiation of the full Q1 DPR will be completed by the Risk control staff reconciling the full trial balances between Q1 open and Q1 close
A full internal balance sheet review will be completed within the Q1 audit timetable which incorporates 
A full circularisation of inventory balances, and matching to source documentation within Enron
Inspection of certain of the above inventory balances, by third party inspectors, where there is an expectation that circularisation replies will not be received on a timely basis
Substantive checks back to source contract documentation for the forward priced and unpriced positions report ( spot checking the key position report signed off by the traders )
Full reconciliation and recalculation of OBSF option premium values
Full reconciliation of contracts within the OBSF to Barclays documentation ( thereby substantiating existence of stock that we have option to purchase ) and to AS400 Barclays account
A risk based debtors review - matching to source documentation, where applicable, and any subsequent post quarter end cash movements
A full substantiation of creditors to internal ( contract commitments ) or external documentation ( invoices/request for payment )
A full reconciliation of intercompany accounts
A full substantive reconciliation of cash and funding accounts

I intend to provide weekly updates on the status of the above actions during April 

If you have any questions please call me on x34703

Regards

Mike

Yes. I was thinking local. We need to talk with Maryann Long.

He will almost certainly work with Fallon and Hannon at EBS. He is the one 
looking to move and the position as I understand it has no timeframe (2 years 
plus). My recommendation is no FSP, Housing, Education or Equalisation. Renew 
his contract (expires shortly if I recall correctly) and pay him some money 
up front in cash/options to cover housing and education for first 2 years 
plus standard relo/house sale.

Barry just left me an urgent message for me to call him back to discuss his 
move to Houston. He said that he spoke with you about a package but you were 
"vague" and he wanted more concrete details. There must have been a reason 
you were vague!! Were you thinking local deal? He definitely mentioned "expat 
terms" in the voicemail over 20 times so that is not his idea.

Any idea of why this move is taking place? He wants to bring UK people over 
with him as well so definitely want to send the right message.

Thanks

I would welcome the opportunity to walk you through these presentations if 
you have time. It has been 6 weeks - 2 months since we did an integration 
update for Rick and hopefully this will demonstrate that we are out of 
integration and managing more in the line as if it was any other business - 
with it's usual set of problems.

I am also using this report to update Joe Gold who has been moved by the 
office of the chair to President of the EnronMetals Group 

Hope all is well

Please find attached two presentations on current position/challenges with 
the Metals group and inventory balances in particular. 

The former outlines the 'Control' view of integration efforts - past, current 
and urgent future
The latter is a summarised response to your earlier concerns over inventory 

I look forward to discussing these with you at 9.30am / 15.30 pm ( London ).

Subject: Continental Power - the case for greater experience/breadth of view 
in the controllers' position

Sally

Further to our discussion on Friday I summarise my view of Joe Gold's issues 
with the MO control process

Joe expressed some frustration with the current status as follows: -

The DPR has historically been 'filled with noise' around adjustments for 
edits on trades, provision restatements etc which negates it's effectiveness 
for him as a control/supervisory report 
The risk team appear to have been reacting to p&l 'noise'  - particularly 
around transmission adjustments rather than proactively finding booking 
solutions - or instructing IT to flex Enpower
Settlements have gained a perception in the market place for 'errors' such 
that originators are informing Joe that business is being 'lost' due to our 
perceived inability to support transactions - ( must be careful here as no 
specifics on errors have been provided )
The risk team ( post Neil Tarling's transfer to EBS ) is relatively junior 
and does not possess many 'years' of experience of Power support
James New as Power,Gas and Credit Controller has ( necessarily ) too broad a 
role for him to focus on these detailed issues

In mitigation

The recent continental book split ( which is only now being 'settled' in to 
the daily process) and the clean up of historic provisions/reserves prior to 
Neil Tarling's transfer has exaggerated the base issue around certainty of 
daily p&l
Designing an approximate booking process for transmission has not been a top 
priority for the risk team in the recent past ( this was either wrong or the 
prioritisation call  was not  effectively communicated to Joe ) - and it is 
felt that there are no IT resources to code  these solutions to Enpower ( 
also London struggles to influence Houston IT resource prioritisation )
The settlements infrastructure has been supporting a business volume growth 
it is not designed for and supporting acitivity on this platform requires 
'skilled' staff ( we are down on resources for Continental Power ) - 
continuing growth in volumes are expected along with junior settlement staff 
being asked to join Commercial groups
We are  experiencing  generational  change as a result of Barry's move to EBS 
- resourcing is James and my top priority

I believe what Joe is asking for, is what we are trying to provide - namely :

upgrade in resourcing in the risk group where we are insisting that the lead 
individual has full responsibility, end to end, for the business including 
the assessment of operational risk and effectiveness of the business process,
focus on identifying and implementing the necessary quick hit solutions that 
eliminates 'manual workarounds' and consequently 'noise' in the process
more proactive communication with Commercial - especially to manage 
expectations
a definitive plan for how the strategic upgrade in applications architecture 
for MO will benefit/change his business support

However, we are behind in finding the 'right' replacement for Neil ( one with 
experience and breadth of view potential ), we have found a continental power 
settlemetns manager but he does not arrive until July 3 rd, we have been

David - Can I get a detailed breakdown of the time that each component part 
of the risk feed for London turned up ?

As to going forward  - I take on board your suggestion that our current 
trading position / direction requires us to rethink from first principals the 
feed process and the current critical path problems.

I will get back to you ASAP

Regards

Mike

Subject: London Risk Reporting

Well,
today (or rather yesterday) it happened.  We have been pushing our limits 
hard and the makets here have been very volatile.  We had a large increase in 
North American Natural Gas VAR due to the breaking apart the Rockies/SoCal 
basis correlation.  This am, we were attempting to get firm numbers on the 
effect on our corporate limits so that we could provide 
Jeff/Delainey/Lavorato/Buy/.... the information to make decisions whether or 
not to reduce positions.  The number was not firm until 11 am houston time.  
My understanding is that the Houston numbers were all in before 8 am and that 
we were waiting for London.  While I am sure that there are issues all around 
and I do not think that anyone Senior in Houston is even aware, let alone 
prepared to blame, I fear that this will not always be the case.  I think 
something needs to be changed in our process so that this can be avoided in 
the future.   

Please do not take this as a nasty-gram.  No one is cc'd or bcc'd.  I just 
think that it will be deemed unacceptable.
Any thoughts/comments?
Ted

Jan Erland has just called me from Oslo, he told me Brent & Bjorn are due 
over there next week.

I guess I'm a touch surprised no one told me, as Jan Erland reports to me. He 
is Local Office Controller.  I'm assuming it will be a 'post-Helsinki' type 
review, right? Is there any particular things they/you would like to look at 
or discuss?

As you know we operate some of the IBS functions from Oslo and some from 
London. I'm happy to discuss this further. Do your people need an 
introduction to the operation etc...?

Hope your well, Barry.

everyone is happy with the draft. The Appendices are as per the third report

I have arranged to come over from the 14th to the 20th of March inclusive to 
cover a number of things including some doorstep work. Will you have an hour

Patti - Could you please arrange for me to have the use of a desk for this

Sally - I mentioned this issue when I was over in Houston and hoped to cover 
it again when we discussed EnVision ( following your meeting with Mary and 
Joel - I think Joel was organising )

Brent  - Do you have a moment to catch up Envision and the on the common 
timetable specifically ?

All - I am planning to organise a Houston / Europe conference call to discuss 
Enlighten and the applications and current/future business requirements that 
are dependent on it. I would like to get an understanding of your prefered 
level of involvement

Cindy

Sorry if there was any confusion in my email - it was not actually prompted 
by your questions about Enlighten, which haven't caused ripples and in any 
case are appropriate questions to ask.

I'm really trying to get commitment from business sponsors (principally Mike 
on this side) on both sides of the pond to agree a common timetable for 
functionality.  If we don't get this, it may be difficult for us to maintain 
a common database across Houston and London, and IT will end up acting as a 
broker between different business areas when establishing priorities.  I 
doubt any of us want that.

Cheers

John

Subject: Re: Enlighten Common Timetable  

For Global Markets, we were not scheduled to get anything by the end of the 
year from Enlighten, Envoice or DTL.  But in order to establish what could 
potentially be delivered by July 2001, we were inquiring as to the data 
elements that were going to be stored as well as the functionality.  It would 
be hard to make committments to use an application, without really knowing 
what it does.  Clarification was what we were trying to get and will require, 
to do a true gap analysis so we can quantify the extent that these 
applications fit or do not fit our business.  

I received a functional spec for Envoice today and would like to get one for 
DTL and Enlighten to get a better understanding of the scope of these and 
possible enhancements that could be added on later.

I am sorry if my queries caused some "ripples".   I still would like some 
tangible information to start looking at regarding these applications.  
Please let me know what information you can supply us.   Thanks    Cindy

Subject: Enlighten Common Timetable

Dear all

There is currently some debate as to what is going to be delivered by 
Enlighten.  Some clarification and a question:

Clarification:
Enlighten (certainly in London) is actually a data hub, rather than an 
application.  In itself, it will not add business value.  However, the tools 
which sit on top of this system will add business value.  These tools are 
currently DTL, Envoice, Zebra.  However, I think we all anticipate more 
requirements being developed as this central data store becomes richer.

Question (for business sponsors):
We are trying hard to coordinate US and UK efforts.  However, this will be 
extremely difficult if our respective business timelines are not the same.  
Say - for example - Mike wants Enlighten to deliver volumetric reporting by 
then end of 2000 but Cindy instead wants a full DPR in the same timeline.  
Our data architects are going to struggle to coordinate and prioritise their 
work if we are working for two separate sets of masters.  So:

If we are really to reap the rewards of a UK/US implementation, a common 
timetable is extremely important.  Who are our primary UK and US business 
sponsors and can we ask them to agree a mutual timeline ?  I suspect if we 
are to try and make this a joint development, nothing will make delivery 
harder than having separate and sometimes mutually exclusive sets of 
requirements from our user communities.  

Comments/answers please...

Cheers

John

Proposed list - of all potential candidates

Myself
James New - and his lead risk managers
Mike Wellings - UK Power
Coralie Evans - Continental Power
Robert Yeo - UK and Continental Gas
Paul D'Arcy - Structured Products
David Wall - Credit
Tim Poullain-Patterson - Metals Integration
Andrew Cornfield - Metals Risk Manager
Kevin Rhodes - Metals Controller ( there are in fact two controllers at 
present Kevin for Financial Trading and Howard Carter for Merchanting )

I would leave Ralph Jaeger of Frankfurt out of the offsite if places are 
restricted  - He is covered by the mainstream Accounting conferences, but I 
would have Jan Erland, and Heidi and Tiong Hock from Singapore.

I am not sure Fernley would want to be there - but I can ask.

On others  - Simon Thurbin of liquids in london should be in Houston and 
would be a good choice for inclusion. Brent may want his two London 
controllers of Cindy Horn and Kenny Nicoll to also come

Would you invite Kristen to come with( in place of Barry? ).

A long list ( and we may want to cut back ) but all these individuals carry 
the burden of operational risk assessment and management - standardising that 
process would be an achievement indeed.

Mike

PS  - Shall we revisit Agenda and discuss who should start preparing 
presentations - we had thought about engaging RAC, IT etc

Here is the abridged draft of the document for the presentation to Joe Sutton.

The 'expected loss' calculation in the previous version was intended to show 
the outcome if we assume some recovery of amounts owing from Vneshtopprom, 
but until we re-engage in the negotiation we can only speculate as to what 
this may be. Hence, we have restricted the analysis to the maximum exposure.

Please e-mail Kevin Sweeney and me with any comments/amendments.

We are in the final stages of this process  - where we draft a cover letter 
for John which will introduce this for inclusion within Globalflash ( the 
Enron Europe newsletter )

Have you any thoughts on draft or cover note ?

Sally,

The draft for your review and comments, as promised. The sooner I can get 
this out, the sooner the trading floor gossip will stop. (no such thing as a 
secret in Enron is there?).

Many thanks

Fernley


In view of the continued integration of a number of Enron global functions, I 
am pleased to announce that the European Trading Support functions will, with 
immediate effect, be consolidated into one operational unit. This unit, to be 
headed by Barry Pearce (VP of Trading Support Operations) and based in 
London, will include the European Gas, European Power and the Global Liquids 
groups.

This newly created unit will work within the remit of Global Risk Management 
Operations and will adopt the following core responsibilities in Europe.

1. Enhance communication and integration among all trading support operations 
professionals.
2. Assure the proliferation of best operational practices. 
3. Facilitate the allocation of human and systems resources.  
4. Provide key training for all trading support operations personnel.
5. Co-ordinate user requirements for shared operational systems. 
6. Work with ECT NA to oversee the creation of a global internal control 
audit plan for trading support   activities.
7. Establish procedures for opening trading support operations offices and 
create key benchmarks for   measuring on-going trading risk controls.   
   
In this role, Barry and his team will ensure that all Enron operations in 
Europe meet the extremely high standards of trading support we expect 
throughout our organisation. Barry will report directly to myself and also to 
Sally Beck in her capacity as head of Global Risk Management Operations.

Barry has been involved in the European Energy Operations function since 1993 
and manages risk management administration, risk consolidation and reporting, 
contract administration, contract settlements, cash management and trading 
accounting for ECT Europe's physical commodity trading, energy derivatives 
trading and financial products trading. He has been with Enron since 1992, 
when he joined the company from Arthur Andersen. 

Please join me in congratulating Barry in his new role and supporting him and 
his team in this exciting challenge they have ahead.

Please note this is confidential at this point!

To document what we discussed by phone, I met with Sally Beck and Brent Price 
today.  Fernley Dyson has a vacancy that he is attempting to fill, but it may 
be 3 to 6 months before the position is up and running.  To accomplish the 
need in the meantime, Sally and Brent have agreed to share the duties as 
follows:

Brent - April 1 to June 15
Sally - June 16 to August 15

They are traveling to the UK the week of 3/20 and would like to schedule some 
time with you on either Monday afternoon or Wednesday.  Please let us know 
what is good for you.

Issues:

Housing - They will each be bringing their families with them (Brent - spouse 
and 2 small children - the baby will need a crib; Sally - husband and 3 
children - ages 15, 11 and 2).  I understand that the houses which have been 
vacated due to returning expats have all been filled, so can you have someone 
arrange for corporate housing that will accommodate them?

Immigration - Due to the fact that they will be traveling back and forth and 
have made trips already, I feel it would be best to apply for work permits 
versus using the visa waiver.  I have sent them the forms and requested that 
Brent complete his and file immediately to increase chances of getting his 
sometime shortly after he arrives in the UK.  I have informed him that he 
should arrive without his family if the permit has not been received by April 
1.

Tax - Please confirm whether PAYE will need to be paid for them during the 
short term assignment and then reclaimed through a treaty benefit.

Benefits - I have suggested that they remain on US domestic payroll and 
benefits and, if medical claims arise that exceed what they would have spent 
in the US, they may claim the excess on the expense report.

Per diem - We need to discuss the appropriate amount based on family size.

Let me know of any other issues we need to address.  As always, I appreciate 
your help.

Jane

Barry,
please make sure that someone in the DPR - Houston team gets these memos as 
well.
I would recommend copying Mike Moscoso on any notices that you send me.
I am sure that it is confusing, but eventually we will get it right.

BP - You were going to send the limit violation memo previously forwarded to 
T Murphy on APX as well (ie. P&L)?  It will be easier to get this from you as 
Murphy is out on business.  When do you expect to complete the memo for the 
incremental (10MM) loss on the APX positions to be run through today's DPR?  
Going forward, make sure to copy both Port and I on this and similar items.  
Thanks.

Please can you arrange for Todd Hall, who is coming from Houston to work for 
Barry Pearce, to stay at Dolphin Square apartments? Please liaise with him 
directly on this.

We have a bit of a complicated costing situation. Barry Pearce will be taking 
the cost of the normal one bedrooms at Dolphin Square and Sally is taking the 
rest of the cost.

Jane - please provide the costs for Sally's RC.

Thanks

Sounds great - can we get the material sent to Euorpe for our review - or I 
could do a follow up !!

Does the opportunity exist for IPTV of the 3 hours - or perhaps the final

Sharron,

Please find attached the presentation for the meeting on Helsinki with Joe 
Sutton at 8.30am (there have been some minor changes from earlier versions). 
Would you print off enough colour copies for the Houston attendees?




I also attach a supplementary document which may not be required in the 
meeting, but it would be useful if a number of copies could be to hand just 
in case.




Many thanks

Please note this is confidential at this point!

To document what we discussed by phone, I met with Sally Beck and Brent Price 
today.  Fernley Dyson has a vacancy that he is attempting to fill, but it may 
be 3 to 6 months before the position is up and running.  To accomplish the 
need in the meantime, Sally and Brent have agreed to share the duties as 
follows:

Brent - April 1 to June 15
Sally - June 16 to August 15

They are traveling to the UK the week of 3/20 and would like to schedule some 
time with you on either Monday afternoon or Wednesday.  Please let us know 
what is good for you. 
I have free time on the morning of the 20th. I will book out a room from 
11-12am in HR. Please let me know if this is a problem.

Issues:

Housing - They will each be bringing their families with them (Brent - spouse 
and 2 small children - the baby will need a crib; Sally - husband and 3 
children - ages 15, 11 and 2).  I understand that the houses which have been 
vacated due to returning expats have all been filled, so can you have someone 
arrange for corporate housing that will accommodate them? I think the best 
way to go here is for us to use serviced apartments as it will be very 
difficult to find a lease for such a short period for this type of 
accommodation. My assistant, Lisa, has put a call in to a service who can 
help us find serviced accommodation in South Kensington/Chelsea area or in 
Dolphin Square where we have people now who are very satisfied. Is there a 
reason you are partial to South Kensington/Chelsea? What if we find 
accommodation in another nice area of London within a short commute to the 
office? When I have some options, I will let you know, probably on Monday.

Immigration - Due to the fact that they will be traveling back and forth and 
have made trips already, I feel it would be best to apply for work permits 
versus using the visa waiver.  I have sent them the forms and requested that 
Brent complete his and file immediately to increase chances of getting his 
sometime shortly after he arrives in the UK.  I have informed him that he 
should arrive without his family if the permit has not been received by April 
1. Brent's work permit will be submitted today and we may receive if before 
April 1st, but it is unlikely. The way it works for this is as follows: Brent 
will receive the work permit from us and if he is here, he will have to leave 
the UK and enter with the work permit for it to be validated. If his family 
are in Houston, they will need to receive entry clearance in the US prior to 
arriving in the UK. This takes approx 7 working days and they will require 
either Brent's original passport and work permit or a certified copy of each 
along with other things such as marriage and birth certificates. If Brent 
decides to bring his family with him to London prior to receiving the work 
permit, they must say they are coming on a vacation for a short period of 
time and have a return ticket to back it up. Once the permit is received, the 
family can either travel back to Houston and submit the entry clearance visas 
there or they can all travel to Amsterdam where they are currenlty issuing 
entry clearance without a problem. There is always a small element of risk in 
going to Amsterdam, however, as do not have to issue the stamps there, they 
just do it because they are nice! Work permits are arriving approx 4 weeks 
from date of submission. We can discuss all of this on the 20th.

Tax - Please confirm whether PAYE will need to be paid for them during the 
short term assignment and then reclaimed through a treaty benefit. PAYE is 
due after 60 days; however, if Brent and Sally are really only going to be 
here for approx 75 days, I am not going to inform the Revenue that they are 
here. If this extends beyond the set time, we can look at options but the 
only responsiblility that Brent and Sally will have is to ensure they 
complete the tax organiser in order for us to get the tax back. Also, as we 
would have to apply the treaty here, we need to ensure the salary costs stay 
in Houston. Jane, have you discussed this point? 

Benefits - I have suggested that they remain on US domestic payroll and 
benefits and, if medical claims arise that exceed what they would have spent 
in the US, they may claim the excess on the expense report. Agreed.

Per diem - We need to discuss the appropriate amount based on family size. 
Jane, please call me to discuss. I have left you a message, thanks

Let me know of any other issues we need to address.  As always, I appreciate 
your help.

Sally

I gave this presentation to John Sherriff, Richard Lewis and Joe Gold this 
afternoon - lots of interesting feedback !

Would love to take you through this  - I also took Joel Henenberg through an 
early draft version and suggested we should discuss it on a call with 
yourself and Mary next week.

There are some significant issues arise around Thunderball and Global Markets 
which we have started to discuss with Kevin Swenney and Cindy Horn ( I missed 
my opportunity to take Brent through all the issues this afternoon but will 
try to get to him soon ).

Hope all is well - speak to you soon

Tara,

I talked withTodd today, but we still don't have anything firm yet. He 
currently intends for his family to return to the U.S. sometime the week of 
May 8th with or without him. If that is the case, he himself should be able 
to be out before May 15 even if he has to relocate to a hotel. However, he's 
asked for another week to get things in order. 

We agreed to talk again next Tuesday, April 25, to nail down exact dates. Is 
this okay? Are there any constraints that require us to firm this up before 
then?

Thanks,
Tom x33926

Please note this is confidential at this point!

To document what we discussed by phone, I met with Sally Beck and Brent Price 
today.  Fernley Dyson has a vacancy that he is attempting to fill, but it may 
be 3 to 6 months before the position is up and running.  To accomplish the 
need in the meantime, Sally and Brent have agreed to share the duties as 
follows:

Brent - April 1 to June 15
Sally - June 16 to August 15

They are traveling to the UK the week of 3/20 and would like to schedule some 
time with you on either Monday afternoon or Wednesday.  Please let us know 
what is good for you.

Issues:

Housing - They will each be bringing their families with them (Brent - spouse 
and 2 small children - the baby will need a crib; Sally - husband and 3 
children - ages 15, 11 and 2).  I understand that the houses which have been 
vacated due to returning expats have all been filled, so can you have someone 
arrange for corporate housing that will accommodate them?

Immigration - Due to the fact that they will be traveling back and forth and 
have made trips already, I feel it would be best to apply for work permits 
versus using the visa waiver.  I have sent them the forms and requested that 
Brent complete his and file immediately to increase chances of getting his 
sometime shortly after he arrives in the UK.  I have informed him that he 
should arrive without his family if the permit has not been received by April 
1.

Tax - Please confirm whether PAYE will need to be paid for them during the 
short term assignment and then reclaimed through a treaty benefit.

Benefits - I have suggested that they remain on US domestic payroll and 
benefits and, if medical claims arise that exceed what they would have spent 
in the US, they may claim the excess on the expense report.

Per diem - We need to discuss the appropriate amount based on family size.

Let me know of any other issues we need to address.  As always, I appreciate 
your help.

Jane

Thanks for your note Sally that is very helpful .
I think my main concern is to ensure that we have the most effective and 
efficient communication between the Doorstep team and the business unit . I 
would like John and I to be more involved in the process so that the team can 
put the situation in context , so that they know our concerns in addition to 
any they may have . It is also important to be clear as to what has already 
been identified and is being addressed and how . While I understand that part 
of the idea of doorstep is to " rattle the cages " of the commercial 
management , it is important to check if my cage is already rattling as it 
was in this case . 
John and I would always expect to see and discuss a report before it is 
discussed in Houston - unless there is a very good reason to do otherwise . I 
take any issues of a control nature very seriously but my approach is to 
insist on a verification of the facts before making any judgements which does 
lead to some delay , on occasion , while facts are being gathered . What I 
would also like , in addition to a briefing and discussion at the start of 
the review , is a debrief from the team to get their impressions directly , 
both as to the issues and also as to how my control teams are doing . There 
is always a question of prioritisation of resource , particularly in 
businesses like metals which will be a constant challenge ( going forward you 
will have similar issues on Steel etc ) and I would like the doorstep team to 
provide me with their input on whether they agree with our approach and also 
to discuss areas where I think an additional doorstep review may be helpful 
.  I know you are working on the doorstep process with Mike Jordan , but I 
would be grateful if you could ensure that the increased communication 
happens in the future .
Thanks
Michael

Subject: Doorstep Review Process

Doorstep reviews are by design a quick look at commercial activities and the 
mid and back office support for those activities in our wholesale 
businesses.   (EBS and EES will be included in 2001.)  The controls around 
mid and back office activities are best understood by conducting a deal test 
- i.e. following the process and documentation around a series of 
transactions from the inception of a deal through the collection of cash.  
Asking someone to explain their processes and controls is more the act of 
explaining what we think happens.  Doing a deal test tells us what does 
happen.  And it is when there are differences between the controls that we 
believe to be in place and what actually happens, that we identify where 
operational, and perhaps financial, risk is created. 

These reviews are not designed to replace the internal audit work for which 
Enron has contracted with Arthur Andersen.  As such, they are purposely 
designed to be conducted in a shorter timeframe than AA's reviews and to 
produce less paperwork.  It is both the quick assessment of control gaps and 
potential operational risk, and the quick solutions to correct these, that 
are valuable in these reviews.  These reviews also look  for ways to leverage 
success stories from one office to another in terms of best in class 
practices or practical solutions to shared problems.  Briefly, the doorstep 
review process would follow this set of steps:

 1)  Cross-functional doorstep review team arrives at subject office.  This 
is usually unannounced, but key personnel in the subject office may be 
notified of the review a few days prior to the team's arrival to be certain 
that key individuals in that office will be not be out of town. 

 2)  Doorstep team lead will meet with the head of the subject office to tell 
them about the parameters of the review and to ask their co-operation in 
making information and personnel available to complete the review.  

 3)  The review is conducted, including information sessions with key 
commercial personnel to understand the business conducted in the office and 
key control/operations personnel to understand the business processes.  The 
deal test is conducted on a relevant sample of deals to verify the process 
and controls that were followed in the life of the transactions.  

 4)  The doorstep team usually has a rough draft of key points by the end of 
the review, which includes both controls that are working well and those 
which may not be working as designed.  Potential action items are suggested.  
This information is reviewed with the head of the office, as they are usually 
very interested in knowing what can be done to improve controls to support 
their business.   There are times when the head of an office will suggest an 
additional point to be added to the list of action items, knowing that with 
this focus he/she can get help in accomplishing certain efforts to support 
the growth of their business.  The doorstep team lets the head of the office 
know to whom this information will be communicated and the timing for doing 
so. 

 5)  Starting late in 2000, the findings from doorstep reviews would next be 
reviewed with Ted Murphy and me.  Ted's viewpoint would be from Risk Controls 
and mine from the mid and back office operations point of view.  Ted and I, 
assisted by Cassandra Schultz and Shona Wilson, would work with appropriate 
personnel in the subject offices to understand who would assume 
responsibility for addressing action items noted from the doorstep review and 
to determine the appropriate time period for completing these action items.  
Then on a quarterly basis, Ted and I would meet with Rick Buy and Rick Causey 
to give them a recap of doorstep reviews completed during that quarter, 
doorstep findings that had been handled, updates on any outstanding doorstep 
findings and plans for the next quarter.  Through most of 2000, the doorstep 
teams met with Rick and Rick within a few days of returning from each 
doorstep review.  This immediate feedback step was passed to Ted and me 
sometime late in 2000.  We did agree that we would meet with Rick and Rick 
before the quarterly review if certain doorstep findings were of particular 
concern or if we felt that they needed to be informed on an issue in a more 
timely manner than quarterly.   

Steps 1 through 4 were followed in the review of the scrap metals business in 
Germany.  Shona did conduct a debriefing session with the managing directors 
in charge of the scrap metal business.  Her impression was that they were not 
concerned over the length of time that it was taking to implement the 
integration plan nor over the somewhat irregular payment methods that were 
discovered during the deal test that are not in keeping with Enron's 
practices.  Shona also debriefed with Mike Jordan, and I believe that Fernley 
was involved in that session as well.  At my suggestion, she also contacted 
Joe Gold to inform him of her findings.  I do not know what the timing was 
for Joe to get back to Shona, relative to Rick Buy's e:mail message.  

Michael, I understand that you may have felt blind-sided by the e:mail from 
Rick Buy on his concerns over the scrap metal business.  And if that was the 
case, I apologize for that.  While Shona did debrief with Mike and Fernley, I 
know that she did not review the teams findings directly with you.  If you 
would like to be included in a direct debriefing with the doorstep team when 
they review businesses that are managed by EEL, we can certainly add that as 
a clear step from this point going forward.   The out of the ordinary step in 
this doorstep review was Shona's call to Rick Buy and Rick Causey to alert 
them to the doorstep team's concerns over irregular payment methods and the 
level of interest in controls that she perceived from the commercial managing 
directors.   I attribute that to a miscommunication between Shona and 
myself.   Although we had changed the process at year end so that the 
download after doorstep was to be with Ted and me, as Shona and I voice 
mailed back and forth she thought that I had asked that she initiate a 
meeting with Rick and Rick.   This meeting should have been with Ted and me.  
In leaving a voice mail for the two Rick's about setting up a meeting, Shona 
mentioned some concerns.  Rick Buy is the one that called her back and asked 
for more detail.  She definitely covered both the teams findings and the 
integration plan that was underway with Rick Buy.  We don't, however, control 
which points Rick chooses to focus on or those to which he chooses to react.  

To reiterate, the findings from these doorstep reviews are shared with the 
heads of the subject offices at the close of the reviews.  The effort here is 
to help identify control issues that could create risk to a business and to 
offer solutions and resources that may be available from across the entire 
Enron organization.  The key is quick discovery and quick resolution.   The 
findings create a dialogue between the business units, RAC and Operations, 
which I believe is healthy.  We purposefully have chosen not to 
"over-wordsmith" the findings or to delay discussing concerns that can be 
surfaced through these reviews.  Frankly, I believe that these reviews can 
reveal things that are sometimes missed in AA's reviews from a practical 
perspective and afford us the opportunity to mitigate operational risk.  

I would be glad to discuss any details of the doorstep review process with 
you.  We certainly want you to be informed and to view this process as 
valuable input for you in managing EEL's business.  Mike Jordan and certain 
members of his team will be involved with doorstep reviews for other 
businesses outside EEL later in the year.  We are certainly open to any 
suggestions you may have on getting the most out of this process.

Steve and I did some 'thinking' during the downtime between Christmas and New 
Year and we were questioning whether there was a definitive business planning 
document for CL - indeed if there was one, has it now been changed to reflect 
the new priorities consistent with your involvement and leadership ?

Such documentation could assist us in relaunching our Envision program which 
( as a result of necessity ) has become over the last few months a more 
generic change management control process for Enron Europe

Will be in touch

Just to follow up on James's note of yesterday - my apologies for being out

The elimination of the requirement to 'grab' the FX and IR market environment 
from Houston ( and consequently use European data ) can improve our ability 
to kick the overnight batch processing off earlier in the evening. James and 
I will be working with Brian Hudson to determine the timetable for effecting 
this change

The revised batch start time would improve the opportunity to detect any 
system failure and complete a rerun of the valuation process so as to deliver 
completed results by the time the Risk Management team arrive at their desks 
in the morning. System failures are the most significant problem we face in 
delivering timely information to Houston. Consequently the probability of 
meeting current reporting deadlines would be greatly improved given that we 
will have full IT overnight support covering for any IT failure and curve 
input validation processes on trade date.

Indeed given the successful completion of all overnight runs we are able to 
deliver

Officialisation of all valuation systems and most spreadsheets ( David Hardy 
is in final testing of the Eastern spreadsheet feed ) by the 10 AM deadline ( 
Houston 4 AM )
Flash p&l by the 1PM deadline ( Houston 7AM )
Completion of the final DPR to be submitted to Houston by the 5 PM deadline ( 
Houston 11AM )

James and I are currently finalising a document reviewing all possible 
changes to business processes that could improve these times. This is in 
addition to working with Commercial and IT to assess the possibility of 
delivering significantly faster revaluation systems that could assist in 
delivering a trade date control process.

I can confirm that there is significant work to do in this area, however, we 
are dedicated to meeting the objectives of improved/more real time control. 
Please feel free to call if the above requires any additional commentary.

Regards

Mike

Rick,

Thanks you for your note below. We are today implementing a flash P&L 
process. We aim to report daily numbers at 7am Houston time and will start 
today with the P&L. We will build on this and hope to have draft positions 
and VAR for most books within a week or so. There will be a reconciliation of 
flash to final numbers which will be included in our return to Houston. 
 
I will put together a note on the London DPR production process which goes 
into the process we currently have, the process we actually need to have, and 
the obstacles that are in the way. I would expect this to be finalised 
tomorrow. Obtaining the USD interest rate curve on a more timely basis is 
just one of our problems but it is unfortunately by no means our only or most 
serious problem.

Subject: UK Submission of Positions

Need your help on the following: Each day we are delayed in finalising var, 
p&L and positions because the UK must wait for a USD  interest rate curves 
before submitting their data to Houston. I am also told that it is really not 
necessary to wait for this curve and the data could be submitted close of 
business London. Even if there was some minor inaccuracy from this method it 
would be better than what we have now. This would greatly improve the 
efficiency (by 4 to 6 hours) in reporting to senior management. Can you guys 
initiate this change or get me to the right person there. Thanks, Rick

In a frank discussion with Barry I had to advise him that it will be very 
difficult for him to succeed in the role I proposed for him (and indeed in 
his current role in the medium term). He is standing in the cross-hairs of a 
rifle sight - one move and he's dead.

I have no doubt that we will find a role for this talented individual which 
will enable him to sustain the tremendous level of contribution that we are 
used to seeing from him.

Of course it will mean that progress in developing our trading support 
operations will be slower than it otherwise would have been. I shall be 
looking for a suitable candidate to fill the co-ordination role - as you 
know, individuals of the necessary calibre and experience are rare.

Dear John,

The following are the amounts that make up the $5.8 mil.  I have looked into 
your query and noted that there was a late adjustment not exported to us (so 
not captured in the DPR).  The adjustment will be reflected in today's DPR.

Please call me at 713 408 4315 if you have any questions.

Shona,
Pls do the following asap:

 Introduce yourself to John and make sure he knows the most expeditiious ways 
to get information regarding the content of the DPR and Executive Reports.
 Pls consider this request.  I think it is a good idea to either put comments 
on the Corp DPR or each business unit should have their own summary executive 
report that could give more detail.

John,
FYI, Shona works in Sally Beck's Global Operations group and (among 5,000 
other things) is in charge of the group that puts together the DPR.
Cassandra Schultz, who is also copied here, is a VP who works for me in 
charge of Policy issues and works closely with Shona.

My first day physicallyt at Enron House is planned for 1/8/01.

Subject: Status update on the issues surrounding Continental Power 
volatilities and correlations

As you know for some time we have been trying to get the Continental Power 
traders to increase the volatilities they use for valuing their option 
portfolio and for use in calculating their VAR as it has been obvious that 
the market  has become more volatile but this was not being reflected in 
their mark.

In looking at the impacts of this, various other issues came to light. 
Firstly it raised issues over the correlation matrix used in the VAR model as 
this was way out of date. We have worked with Jitendra and have now put in a 
matrix that both the traders, risk and RAC are happy with. Secondly, as you 
may be aware, in Portcalc swaptions currently use the volatility input on the 
deal ticket and not off any volatility curve. 

The current portfolio is 90% swaptions and so this represents a serious issue 
for us in that it is not practical to manually change all the volatilities at 
the deal ticket level every time the implied voaltilities change. We cannot 
use the option functionality as this only values hourly or daily exercise 
options and not fixed expiry swaptions or options. We also have not found any 
way in Portcalc of valuing Asian options so we are having to 'force' in the 
few we have. We have had the Houston based Portcalc IT team work on a 'new' 
piece of swaption valuation code but currently it contains a number of 
worrying bugs. These are primarily that the proposed code does not take the 
correct underlying forward price and uses the volatility of (approximating) 
the last day of the underlying rather than the implied volatility of the  
underlying. 

They are currently being hampered in that they do not have any IT personnel 
who have sufficient option knowledge (I understand that the two most 
experienced coders resigned to go to another Houston based energy company). 
This is extremely worrying and I find it hard to believe that the whole of 
Enron's power business is having to use the methodology of inputting the 
volatility at the deal ticket level. This will almost certainly mean that 
different volatilities are being used in the VAR as are being used to value 
the swaption portfolio globally. As well as these issues we have concerns 
over the use and accuracy of the smile adjustment in Portcalc (worryingly it 
does not seem that you can 'switch' this off). Briefly it seems that Portcalc 
calculates the delta used to adjust the volatility by comparing the strike 
price to the forward price of the last day of the underlying rather than the 
forward price of the underlying itself. 

We have engaged London based  IT and are looking at the code we have used in 
Power 99 to se if there is a way we can get something done quickly to start 
to value all option products off a curve and to be able to book Asian options.

Once we get the above resolved we still have no way or extracting the vega or 
gamma risk from Portcalc in it's current state as the information is just no 
there (so we are told by IT). The system 'seems' (we cannot be 100% sure 
given all the other errors) to produce a vega and gamma P&L number but what 
the risk is remains a mystery. Again this is very worrying in that we have 
Power option traders all over the world who can't get their underlying vega 
or gamma risk position from the global valuation system. We are trying to 
work on something manual to draw a line in the sand but I would really like 
to know how the American based traders cope as they have this problem 
(knowingly or not)  for years. What sign offs were gained for the 
implementation of Enpower because it seems to us that using the current 
system it is not possible to comply with the Global Risk policy. How do we 
validate the inputs to the valuation if we do not know the risk ?

Despite the above we have now persuaded the traders to save out newer higher 
volatilities a week ago and you should have seen a large move up in their 
VAR. However, as it stands at the moment they are notable to save out a daily 
remark as Jitendra is saying that he is not happy with their 'model' / vol 
curve generator (I have today asked for a full explanation, details of any 
testing etc etc and time lines so we can move to getting over this hurdle). 
The swaptions have also not yet had the ticket volatility changed but the 
impacts are expected to be positive as we are long volatility.

I would appreciate your comments on the above as it seems that we are pushing 
the boundaries here on areas which we really expect to have already been 
covered in Houston some time ago and could do with some help. We are having 
to use a system which seems to us to have numerous bugs and short comings and 
are having to spend an enormous amount of IT time overcoming the inadequacies 
of Enpower wich I do not think most people are aware of. Consequently we have 
not been able to deliver all the improvements we were required to do in 
gaining the increased limits so 3 months ago but I would hope you agree that 
it is not for a lack of trying.

Sorry it's so long but if there are any questions or any perceived 
inaccuracies in any of the above then please let me know.

James

I attach below a one page summary of control standards which are believed to 
be fundamental. This summary, produced as a result of the Doorstep review, 
could be a 'yardstick' to benchmark our businesses - ie an aid to 
communication between Commercial, Commercial Support and RAC re the level of 
Operating Risk within each business and the region as a whole. Consequently 
it would be complimentary to the BRM process.



I hope to complete an efficient/judgemental assessment internally for all 
businesses in conjunction with RAC and present the findings to yourselves ( 
and /or your desk managers ) within the next week/10 days. The aim would also 
be to establish that the currrent action plans for Systems Development and 
Support resource allocation is appropriate. The assessment would be based on 
a traffic light scale ie

Green inherent risk less processes/controls gives a residual operational risk 
which is accpetable 
Amber  - watch out - residual operational risk is high and/or control trend 
is decreasing 
Red - stop now we have problem ( Helsinki equivalent ! )

Upon completion of the assessment I will book some time in your diaries

Regards

Mike

Ted / Sally 

We took as an action from the last meeting the need to re-authorise all 
traders within the metals global businesses, sign this list off with the 
EnronMetals Managing Directors and accompany this list with a note 
highlighting the dangers of non authorised trading activity.

Due to the storm here yesterday we had to delay the operational control 
meeting with the MDs until today and therefore hope to have this out tomorrow 
with effect from COB 31 st.

Apologies for the delay - any issues please call

Several related issues have resulted in an increase in the level of operating 
risk for the Merchanting Metals business.

Complexities surrounding the operation of the Off Balance Sheet Facility 
("OBSF") which commenced two weeks before the year end.
The uncertainty generated by the revocation of AA's signoff for the facility 
late in the year end audit.
The discovery of a number of 'bugs' within the AS400 Merchanting code, 
arising from the release of OBSF designed functionality, which compounded the 
operational burden of supporting the OBSF.
The requirement to amend the operational process and OBSF IT code as a result 
of the current renegotiation of the OBSF with Barclays ( and AA ).
The senior IT developer for Merchanting has resigned and been sent on 
gardening leave.
The Corporate requirement to lower working capital usage for the Merchanting 
business irrespective of the above parochial business issues.

Various mitigating actions have been and will be taken to provide focus, gain 
comfort over control levels and to provide assurance to senior management as 
to the accuracy of the Q1 DPR and business balance sheet.

The implementation for SAP for the Merchanting business has been delayed and 
effectively decoupled from the higher risk ( higher benefit ) Brokerage 
implementation - benefit is to provide sole focus on OBSF for IT Merchanting 
developers.
The AR/AP SAP data quality reviews for both businesses are continuing so as 
to provide a detailed analysis as at end Q1.
Middle Office have instigated a new daily working capital report process 
tracking cash settlement/ funding data to working capital components for all 
Metals businesses.
An enhanced position signoff process will be implemented prior to end Q1 
covering gross tonnage, spread positions and summarised analyses for brand 
and locations. The necessary report functionality should be available within 
the AS400, however contingencies have been initiated to build tactical 
VBA/excel reports outside of the AS400 but using AS400 data downloads.
User requests for additional AS400 functionality and reports have been 
aggressively prioritised and a code freeze will commence prior to the end of 
Q1 following the delivery of three reports determined as minimum requirements 
for the support of OBSF.
A resubstantiation of the full Q1 DPR will be completed by the Risk control 
staff reconciling the full trial balances between Q1 open and Q1 close
A full internal balance sheet review will be completed within the Q1 audit 
timetable which incorporates 
A full circularisation of inventory balances, and matching to source 
documentation within Enron
Inspection of certain of the above inventory balances, by third party 
inspectors, where there is an expectation that circularisation replies will 
not be received on a timely basis
Substantive checks back to source contract documentation for the forward 
priced and unpriced positions report ( spot checking the key position report 
signed off by the traders )
Full reconciliation and recalculation of OBSF option premium values
Full reconciliation of contracts within the OBSF to Barclays documentation ( 
thereby substantiating existence of stock that we have option to purchase ) 
and to AS400 Barclays account
A risk based debtors review - matching to source documentation, where 
applicable, and any subsequent post quarter end cash movements
A full substantiation of creditors to internal ( contract commitments ) or 
external documentation ( invoices/request for payment )
A full reconciliation of intercompany accounts
A full substantive reconciliation of cash and funding accounts

I intend to provide weekly updates on the status of the above actions during 
April 

If you have any questions please call me on x34703

Mike,  

Thanks for your message.  You are on point as to my intent.  From the 
discussion I had with Andy last week, there seems to be several similarities 
between the Metals business and industrial markets.  I believe the blueprint 
that is forthcoming will provide more insight that will be helpful to you 
all.  We would love to share this with you, and also discuss your system 
direction.  There may be some opportunities for us to work together on the 
development.  I would like to have a discussion to talk about next steps, and 
believe Andy is planning to initiate this after he returns from holiday.  Let 
me know if you have some other ideas.

I'm sorry that we didn't have a chance to get together last week while I was 
in London.  My trip was very short, and I kept missing you when I went to 
your desk.  I'll plan some time with you when I'm there next time.

Subject: Re: Metals  

Andy,

Thanks so much for your message.  I had you on my "To Do" list today to 
follow-up from our conversation last week.  I appreciate your responses, and 
will follow-up as needed.

Just to recap EIM's current inititives.

PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PWC) was engaged in 10/00 to develop a business plan 
for tactical and strategic solutions for the projected growth in the physical 
business.  In 11/00, AA was engaged to develop a "Blueprint" of EIM major 
processes (Deal Execution, Deal Capture, Risk Management, Logistics, 
Settlements and Financial Reporting), down to level 2 processes.  The 
initiatives have been combined into one team focused on delivering the 
"Blueprint", a gap analysis of Enron systems to business needs and 
recommended systems.  A complete "roadmap" should be laid out with a 
0-3months, 4-6months, 7-9 months and 10-12months timeline.  The plan 
addresses tactical also.  

Our overall objective:  Build an infrastructure (people, processes and 
systems) that is scalable and supports the trading business of EIM.  The 
current industries are Forest Products and Steel.  However, additional 
industries may be added.  The targeted infrastructure would require little 
change to support new industries.  

The delieverable is expected by the end of 2/01.  We'd be happy to visit with 
you all (video conference or Houston,....) to give you more information.  Let 
me know how to proceed.  

Thanks again for your time.  Since I wasn't able to attend the Controllers' 
Conference last 10/00, I'm glad I got to meet you last week.  Stay in touch.

Brenda

As discussed at our meeting last week there are a few areas of commonality 
between Enron Metals and EIM that should allow leverage off common goals.

In particular I promised info on a few areas:

Project Q assessment

A lot of the issues raised in the report are particular to Enron Metals 
(being to do with interfaces with our AS400 ysstem) however high level issues 
which formed part of the decision to not develop this for Enron metals were:
Q is over specified for metals. Traffic / logistics for metals is less 
complex than oil & coal.
Metals process tends towards Buy>Store>Sell whereas for liquids the storage 
is not as prevelant
Metals logistics typically involves trucks whereas liquids is ship/barge

2.    Inventory Controls

Again the reports produced here have been very specific to Enron Metals. Paul 
Wallace a manager in the co-ordination function is working extensively on 
developing the controls in this area. I would suggest that you contact Paul 
directly if you wish to discuss specific areas or inventory controls in 
general.

3.    Funding of inventory

We have a structured finance facility here in London. The deal is specific to 
Enron Metals markets in that it works by reference to LME prices as these are 
the base index for all the positions placed in the facility. If structured 
financing is sort for EIM then it would be appropriate to talk to either 
David Tregar (Metals Commercial) or Bill Appleby (Global Finance) as an intro 
to the issues faced.

4.    Curve Management Process

The markets in which our merchanting division trades are based on the LME 
curves but are linked to a large number of basis curves for quality and 
location. Given the vast number we have opted to break down the markets by 
brand group and port location. E.G. for Copper this means we have a grid with 
5 brand groups and 3 sets of port groups (13 for europe, 7 for the US and 6 
for the Far East). The maintaince & price testing of the grids is made 
manageable by the fact the premiums only need be entered for brand and port 
groups by the traders yet prices can be tested by reference to node points 
i.e. price of  specific brand at a given location which can be checked to a 
market quote.

5.    Re recruitment of paper traders

I haven't been able to contact him but I recall that the brother of David 
Rosenblum, one of the metals traders in Chicago, is a trader of recylced 
paper.

I'll keep you posted on long term system development plans here in London. 
I'd appreciate same for EIM.

Regards
Andy

Subject: SAP Implementation

After a successful period 1 close by 1041 and 1123 I wanted to summarize the 
positives and negatives of the project in order to improve the process for 
the London Metals implementation.

Positives:

Seamless consolidation process with Enron worldwide

Common design allows users in North America to access key financial data to 
help control London Metals business
 accounts receivable
 accounts payable

Aging of accounts receivable for proper control monitoring

Profit Center report functionality for controlling of business by business 
group

Timing of close process in conjunction with Enron worldwide

Cost center control by category link by design to corresponding profit center

Cash control procedures utilizing the Treasury Work Station of Enron Corp.

Direct posting of intercompany accounts to reduce duplicate entries

Production of the Daily Profit Report direct from SAP utilizing the 
consolidation ledger

SAP trail balance controlled by the ledger owner agrees with the DPR by 
profit center

Negatives:

FIT 3 testing should be expanded in order to identify all types of business 
flows and to evaluate how they are being treated in SAP.  NY did a two day 
roll forward of equity which proved useful.  This type of testing could be 
expanded for the London companies.

Poor links of information between GCP system and TWS created many manual 
payments.
 This problem is being sorted out by a process outside the SAP implementation 
team.

Strict intercompany common design rules around intercompany relationships 
have created a difficult control environment.
 SAP intercompany meetings are being conducted to create a system that 
adheres to the common design   however allows better intercompany control 
features between broker and physical company.

A special thanks goes out to the SAP team who's continued dedication on this 
project has made it a success:

Thanks for a great lunch. I am, on reflection, very excited about the things 
we discussed.

The Australian/Pacifice role would be a fantastic opportunity. Kinda - Comm 
Supp Controller/CFO/CAO (whatever...) - basically Sally's & Rick's (C) eyes 
whilst they're asleep (Tokyo support would report into Sydney - same time 
zones). It would also have risk, control, processes & procedures 
responsibilities - working directly with Ted's group. I'll work with them and 
face the 'challenge' so to speak.

Basically - running accounting, risk & controls - and keeping the global risk 
function (headed by yourself) with a flag waving 24 hours a day - kinda 
CFO/CAO/Controller for Enron goes Global/24 hours.

The idea - 'Enronise' the junior offices - put an experienced person in there 
to 'set the standards' and the tone of operations - and train the local 
employess in the ECT way. Working closeIy with IT, RAC, Risk, Operations 
etc...

I love the idea. And I think the timing (vis Helsinki etc..) is perfect.

I think it dovetails well with the current environment of putting the right - 
experienced - people in the right places in the world to ensure that the 
standards remain high - especially with EBS starting to spread into the 
'world'.

Fernley was very supportive on the idea. I guess we would need to speak to 
Commercial people.

I also, on the London subject, spoke to Brent. I think London would benefit 
from Brent - he's a good guy. It would also allow me a shot at the new role 
in say a 2/3 month roll-out - starting in the Summer.

Let's keep talking. Let me know how (if?) you want to progress things. Hope 
Orlando was fun.

Dear Sally,

Just to keep you in the loop, Naomi's group is responsible for all of the 
Enron Europe remote offices and is a great resource to keep us updated on 
what each office is really doing.  We are hoping her group can help us 
determine which offices have origination/trading or are near doing these 
types of activities, as well as what offices have other activities.

We are putting together a short checklist that her team will fill out for 
each office.  Based on that, we can determine whether to scope the office 
into our doorstep review.

Thanks

Shona

Dear Naomi,

As always - good talking to you yesterday.  Based on the discussions you and 
I have had recently, Cassandra and I are in the process of drafting a process 
whereby we receive information from you and your group to help update our 
understanding of the Enron Europe remote offices.  This will allow us to 
better determine which offices to scope into the doorstep review and 
hopefully lessen the doorstep work required from Mike's resources.

I'll send something to you early next week.

Have a good weekend,

Fernley,
As we discussed earlier this year, I have serious concerns about Barry that I 
think are both well-founded and reasonably well documented.  To be fair, I 
will say that since Q1 of last year, I have not seen any FURTHER 
"prosecutable" offenses and he has made some attempts at being more 
communicative.  However, I am clearly unwilling to stake my career on his 
transformation, particulary with as influential person as John Sherriff in 
charge of the office.  Probably more to the point,
it continues to concern me that London has not developed an operations team 
that is not so Barry-dependent.  Evidence to this effect are, the fact that 
he is your only candidate for the Global Products position, that someone from 
Houston has to be part of the "World Tour"  in Europe (Brent Price), that 
your candidates  for a senior interim operations head in Helsinki was David 
Port or Richard Sage, and that your suggestion for additional depth is Steve 
Young.

Further for the record, I believe that I am not the only one with whom Barry 
has a credibility issue - Arthur Andersen, other Global Products personnell, 
and other risk people in London have expressed similar concerns to me - I 
just happen to be the most vocal.
Ted

Subject: Trading Support Operations - London

Rick,

Not wishing to delay the comprehensive review of our trading support 
function, particularly as it relates to our Global Products business, we 
already have Barry Pearce taking a lead in this area.

The issue of concern is whether this should be an interim measure or a more 
permanent solution.  Well - nothing is permanent in Enron and I think Barry 
understands this as well as anybody. If we had a more suitable candidate, we 
would give him/her the job. 

I have seen Barry develop and mature over the last 12 months along with the 
team that we have built around him. I'm convinced that he can add significant 
value by drawing the Global Products support functions 'in to the fold'. 
However, he clearly has a credibility issue with Ted in particular and, 
whilst I do not share Ted's views, I do not hold Barry out as a saint and I 
can see recurring problems if such a key relationship is not well grounded.

I suggest that we continue to search for a candidate - known and trusted 
within Houston, who can instill confidence there. Steve Young (head of RAC in 
London) may be an interesting option, although I'm sure he would not be easy 
to replace. In the meantime we need Barry to take things forward and I will 
be monitoring the situation very closely.

Regards

Fernley.

Rick,

The attached report is an updated version of the document we discussed on 
Friday of last week. Some of the numbers in the exposure analysis are still 
draft and I expect firm numbers in the next few hours. 

My aim would be to streamline this report for the presentation to Joe Sutton, 
but I would welcome your steer on how you plan to conduct the meeting and 
whether or not this format is appropriate.

Regards

Fernley

Update - Current status (all times are London times)

Officialisation for the 31st of May DPR was made around 3pm for both the 
Bilateral and the Pool books.

Officialisation for the 30th was not done due to book running problems which 
resulted in the DPR only being completed at 11pm.

The last V@R calculation was made on the 26th due to book split problems. The 
V@R for the 31st will be run today.

Mike,

I have attached 2 files below.  The file entitled "Continental Power 
Assessment.doc" is the assessment that I had during my eight week stay in 
London.  The file has 2 pages, the first being a summary and the second is 
more detailed.  I may not have given you a copy as you were on vacation 
during my last week.  I did have lunch with Fernley at which time I 
communicated these concerns and future projects.  Also, I met with James New, 
Paul Mead, and Gregor Baumerich on an individual basis and delivered the same 
document.  Lastly, I left a copy for Joe Gold as he was out of the office.

After reading your e-mail to Sally, I composed the second file entitled 
"Continental Power Summary.doc."  This file is a summarized, one-page list of 
issues with which you, Joe, and I are concerned (as well as Sally and Fernley 
of course).  The arrows below each section points out the potential risk that 
we are really talking about.

I am on vacation Friday, June 22 and the week of June 26.  Sally mentioned 
that you are in Houston July 5 - 7.  Let's meet to further discuss these 
issues and so that I may inform you about what continued work is in progress 
for Continental Power.


Thanks,

Todd

Fernley,

Sally Beck asked me to contact you with regards to our confirmation 
procedures here in the Houston office.  Please find attached a document that 
outlines our Financial Transaction Process Flow (kind of a lengthy document 
and I did not include the flow charts but will forward them to you if you 
would like) as well as a list of reports we use to monitor our activity with

Rick,

Not wishing to delay the comprehensive review of our trading support 
function, particularly as it relates to our Global Products business, we 
already have Barry Pearce taking a lead in this area.

The issue of concern is whether this should be an interim measure or a more 
permanent solution.  Well - nothing is permanent in Enron and I think Barry 
understands this as well as anybody. If we had a more suitable candidate, we 
would give him/her the job. 

I have seen Barry develop and mature over the last 12 months along with the 
team that we have built around him. I'm convinced that he can add significant 
value by drawing the Global Products support functions 'in to the fold'. 
However, he clearly has a credibility issue with Ted in particular and, 
whilst I do not share Ted's views, I do not hold Barry out as a saint and I 
can see recurring problems if such a key relationship is not well grounded.

I suggest that we continue to search for a candidate - known and trusted 
within Houston, who can instill confidence there. Steve Young (head of RAC in 
London) may be an interesting option, although I'm sure he would not be easy 
to replace. In the meantime we need Barry to take things forward and I will 
be monitoring the situation very closely.

Regards

Fernley.

Sally,

I need Tom over here ASAP. The flat was given to Todd on the understanding 
that Tom would have it at the start of May. Its now been extended to 18th 
May. I don't wan't to postpone Tom's transfer any longer. Please can you give 
me assurance that Todd will vacate by his newdate of the 18th May.

Thanks

Subject: Re: Move  

Mark,

It's good to hear from you. Sorry we haven't kept you better informed; I 
didn't realize you were not aware of the situation. 

Richard, Iain and I had agreed that it made sense for me and Iain to overlap 
a week either in London or Houston. Since I had commitments in Houston up 
through last week, we decided to overlap in Houston and for me to start in 
London on May 8th.

Sally Beck then approached us about letting Todd extend his stay in the flat 
an extra week since his project was not wrapping up on schedule and since he 
had his whole family with him, so we offered to push my move back one more 
week, to May 15th.

Todd intended to be out of the flat by Thursday, May 11, but apparently his 
plans included working the last weekend of April. Having lost that weekend 
since the London office was closed in anticipation of May Day riots, he now 
wants to stay until Thursday, May 18.

Originally, he suggested that his family would probably return to the U.S. 
the week of May 8th with or without him, so I had proposed that we finalize 
my plans around his leaving on May 11, and he relocate to a hotel if he 
needed to stay longer. Now, though, his family has decided to stick it out 
with him instead of returning early.

Unless somebody dictates an absolute move-out  date to him, I guess we work 
around his *tentative* plan to vacate the flat by May 18 and we target May 22 
as my start date in London. My only concern though, is that his project may 
continue to drag on day-by-day.

Tara needs two full working days to clean the flat, which means Thursday and 
Friday, which gives me Saturday and Sunday to move in. (Depending on how 
strict "two full working days" is, we may actually need for him to be out no 
later than Wednesday, May 17--or even Wednesday, May 10.)

Cheers,
Tom x33926

I just heard today that you're not arriving until the 18th as Todd Hall is in 
the apartment. Please let me know what is going on - this is the first I 
heard, and I think its a bit late considering I thought you'd be here today

A few comments :

As discussed it may be useful to see how the doorstep and BRM approaches 
interact - anything written down that explains it ?

I am going to proceed with driving accountability for op risk assessment to 
my controllers - we should discuss at the global offsite if it is worth 
formalising this process - I am totally open to ideas on this.

Lastly, in conversations with Shawn we agreed to delay the full planning for 
European BRM 2001 whilst we finalise this years reports ( lots of activity 
due in October )

Thanks for the call yesterday

Dear Mike,

Thanks for your insight.  In the past few months we have established a 
detailed approach to doorstep which includes interfacing with BRM.  Through 
my calls the past week, I've been trying to update you so we can determine 
how best to coordinate the Enron Europe work, as well as get an understanding 
of what resources you can supply for this global initiative.

My next step is to contact some of the people on the list you gave me to 
determine their skill set and what locations/commodities they'd be best to 
work on.

I'll send you an updated schedule once I've finalized this.

Thanks

Subject: Transparently controlling the wholesale trading businesses - an 
internal approach to internal audit

Shawn / Shona

We have talked round this issue for some time so I thought I would try to 
take a brief stab at documenting what my preferred approach is (we will need 
to do a great deal of talking before we would circulate widely):-

Aims
Accountability for internal controls must rest with the commercial support 
teams and absolutely with the leaders of those teams.
A culture of control and operational risk assessment requires extensive 
on-going communication and a structure of measurement and tracking.
Any independent process of review such as Doorstep and BRM should fully 
leverage the work engaged by staff in the line and indeed should be focused 
by it
All elements of implementing, completing and reviewing internal control 
should generate defined output
We focus independently the review efforts for trading controls and 
origination controls (we have defined the control structure for trading 
offices, agency offices and origination offices and we must police our 
labelling for each office)
The output from Enron's perspective is appropriate risk issue lists to be 
discussed at control/governance meetings (eg at Sally/Ted/Fernley's level and 
at the audit committee level) - the important issue here is that every list 
must be extracted from an agreed database of issues - different lists have 
different amounts of filtering applied - judgementally by senior/experienced 
staff 
The output from AA's perspective is their internal controls audit opinion 
based upon our database and our review and management process of it

Trading Process - monthly
Routine judgemental self assessment on areas within the trading transaction 
cycle - rating made by business controller is red, amber, green - with trend 
indicator of static, improving or declining - see attachment 2 for full 
listing
Monthly metrics collected for key standards set for risk management - see 
attachment 1 (you will notice that this is a summarised version of attachment 
2 - and as a senior controller I would expect the metrics to underpin but not 
solely drive the judgement within the self assessment) - Shona, this is the 
work that Mike Moscoso is leading
Periodic review meeting between controller and commercial lead to discuss 
operational risk and areas of concern (red and amber) with agreement of 
action plans for such areas
Monthly review by controller/senior controller of database where all high 
(red) and medium (amber) risk issues are recorded.  Milestones for action 
plans revisited, reconfirmed or amended
Monthly meeting between remote office staff and controllers to identify if 
the risk rating for any remote offices has changed
All new information on issues raised by self assessment, doorstep review or 
BRM completion populated into database
Database utilised globally to report to various levels of governance and 
decision on whether original BRM and doorstep plans require amendment

Process - Yearly Planning
Checkpoint taken of
current operational environment (say end Oct)
proposed new offices for coming year or proposed changes to activity in 
office, and
IT development plans for next year
Prioritisation made for doorstep - which offices require a visit and what 
depth does report need to go to.  Note the doorstep review would be an end to 
end review for entire business unit and therefore is the independent review 
of the existing self assessment and would leverage the work by focusing the 
review effort on areas of concern, the actions plans in place and concluding 
on the 'mitigation of operational risk to an acceptable level'
Prioritisation made for BRM - which functions, NOT BUSINESS UNITS, require 
external independent review - highly leveraging the above self assessment and 
doorstep processes (could AA signoff simply by auditing our own internal 
governance process?) - most likely reviews completed on functions that 
assessed as concerns across multiple business - such as FX exposure 
management, cash management, credit exposure management, IT change management 
controls/process

Where are we NOW - if we all thought to do this immediately

We do not have bottom up operational risk assessment for all businesses - I 
am suggesting that we demand that all business controllers at the Houston 
offsite do this? 23rd Oct
The above would validate a high level operational risk summary that we as 
senior controllers could put together for the audit committee - last week Oct
We agree on a robust tracking process - throw out one of the BRM and Doorstep 
databases - November
Given AA have never historically risk rated their issues we should repopulate 
the database from scratch - November
Review Doorstep plan to check that our risk rating for business units and 
remote offices means that we have resource focused correctly - do we need to 
visit all? - November
Review all of the above and blend into risk based approach for BRM planning - 
end November to end December !!

Steve,
I am still a little out of it from my travels, but let me take a first shot 
at my reaction to this:
 I think we ought to at least challenge the notion that the mark-to-market 
exposure is so arcane as to be dismissed.  Generally, time is of the essence 
in most contractual relationships and the value of that time should take into 
account both time value of money and the value of the underlying at critical 
times.  
 I think that RAC should be deeply involved in setting negotiating strategy 
and be part of any decisions made.
I will add to this if and when the haze clears up.
Ted

I'm not one for announcements, but the word appears to be out to varying 
degrees, so here is my first cut at clarifying the situation. Prmary 
distribution would be Enron Europe, but your thoughts on content and 
distribution would be welcome.

Thanks

Fernley 



"Many of you will be aware of some recent and forthcoming appointments within 
commercial support in Enron Europe. Enron's rapid growth and the ability of 
our people to use their skills in different roles make this a dynamic 
process, but I have taken this opportunity to summarise changes at a senior 
level in our tax, accounting and transaction support groups.

Peter Hutton has joined us as Vice President, Head of US Tax, reporting to 
Rod Sayers.  Peter was previously a partner in Arthur Anderson and will be 
transitioning in to his new role over the next few months.
Jim Sandt  will be taking up a senior role with the Tax Department in Houston 
early in the new year.

Melissa Allen is to join us shortly as Vice President, Head of Financial 
Operations and Transaction Support, reporting to me. Melissa needs no 
introduction to many of you, as she has worked with Enron Europe as a senior 
manager in Arthur Anderson for the past 18 months. 
Beth Apollo will be returning to Houston in the early part of next year to 
take up a senior role in Enron North America's Energy Operations group. 
Phillip Lord is transitioning in to his new Houston - based role as Chief 
Accounting Officer for Enron Broadband Services.

Buddy Aiken and Stephen Wood will be taking on the lead roles in Transaction 
Support and Financial Operations respectively, reporting to Melissa Allen.

I am sure you will join me in welcoming Peter and Melissa to Enron, in 
congratulating Jim, Beth, Phillip, Buddy and Stephen, and wishing them all 
well in their new roles"

Subject: Trip to London Next Week


Brent Price and I will be in the London office next week, arriving Monday 
morning and returning to Houston on Friday.  The purpose of my visit is in 
regard to my Global Risk Management Operations role,   I believe that Rick 
Causey met with you regarding some operations support that Brent and I will 
provide to Fernley during a transition period prior to the arrival and during 
the assimilation of Michael Jordan, the JP Morgan staffer that Fernley has 
hired.  Brent and I will be working with Fernley next week to iron out the 
details of our support for Fernley during that transition period.  We will 
also map out an Enron trading operations introduction  for Michael Jordan, 
which may involve a short stint for him in Houston.  My goal is to provide a 
strong resource to Fernley during this transition period and to work with 
Fernley to provide whatever assistance, training, and orientation to Michael 
in his role so that his assimilation can be as smooth and effective as 
possible.  

Another purpose for the trip is to spend some time with Fernley and his  
business controllers  to get their ideas on specific goals that as a group we 
would commit to for 2000.  I know that Barry and Richard Sage have many good 
ideas on how we can leverage knowledge and best practices across all Enron 
locations with trading operations.  My earlier trips to London this year were 
focused solely on Helsinki, and did not allow time to positively focus on 
leveraging worldwide operations experience.  I value input from other trading 
operations professionals and I look forward to the ideas that can be 
generated in working with Barry, Richard and some of their direct reports.  

I also contacted Tani Nath about my trip to see how I could support her as 
she moves into her role in Global Products.  I have not heard  from Tani, but 
I understand from others that she will be in the Houston office next week.  
It will be unfortunate to miss her on my trip, but based on my commitments in 
Houston and Rick Causey's desire to move forward on providing trading 
operations support to Fernley, next week is the best for me to be in London.  
I did meet with Tani for an hour when she was here week before last and 
offered to help her in any way if she made the decision to accept the role 
over Global Products.  I trust that she will contact me for that support as 
needed.  

I have scheduled a short meeting one on one with you while I am there to 
discuss how my global role can provide support and resources for your 
business efforts in London.  I look forward to meeting with you next week.  

This trip is not a leg of the worldwide operations/control review that we are 
conducting at Joe Sutton's request.   By circumstance, as you know, we have 
taken a look at Helsinki and subsequently Oslo and Frankfurt.  There will be 
a similar review of Continental power, UK gas, UK power and global liquids.  
The review teams are currently focused on operations/controls reviews of 
North American locations and some entities in the US in which Enron has a 
large ownership position.  It is likely that the continuation of this effort 
in London will occur in mid April.  

Copies of the drafts of the findings for Oslo and Frankfurt were provided to 
Fernley as soon as the team returned to Houston.  We hope to finalise those 
drafts this week as we receive comments from Fernley and the business 
managers in Oslo and Frankfurt to whom those drafts were provided.  Fernley 
suggested that you would like to see the drafts as opposed to the final 
copies, so I will have those forwarded to you today.  The Sydney and 
Singapore trip was a lengthy one, as it also involved a last leg of the trip 
in London with regard to support for SIngapore.  The Houston team returned 
the middle of last week and worked with AA on an early draft last Friday.  I 
can also provide you with a draft of that report, the completion of which was 
pending input from Bill Bradford early this week (he made the trip but was 
out of the office last week).  We did do a preliminary review of the Sydney 
and Singapore findings with Rick Causey and Rick Buy on Friday afternoon, to 
accommodate the fact that both are out on vacation this week.  They 
understood the preliminary nature of the draft that was reviewed with them.

Sally,

As you are probably aware the Continental Power book split project went well 
but there were a number of areas which were not completed for one reason or 
another but essentially IT did not deliver according to the agreed timetable. 
Todd was instrumental in helping me to drive this forward and was responsible 
for much of what we achieved.

As you may also be aware we had some personnel issues and there have been 
significant changes in the Continental Risk Management team. We have now 
recruited a strong manager in Coralie Evans from CSFB and she starts on the 
29th of August. We have also added Michelle Waldhauser from the Houston Gas 
Risk Management team who arrived on the 7th of August.

There are a number of issues and developments which would greatly benefit 
from having Todd here in London for around a month (I say around a month as I 
am guessing within this period he would want to spend some time in Oslo 
pushing the weather Risk Management area forward). Attached is a page I put 
together that cover our immediate needs and why Todd is ideally placed to 
potentially add an enormous amount of value to the Continental Power business.

Could we please get together with Brent Price and Mike Jordan and discuss 
whether Todd would be available come over.

Thanks and regards James

Shawn / Shona

We have talked round this issue for some time so I thought I would try to 
take a brief stab at documenting what my preferred approach is (we will need 
to do a great deal of talking before we would circulate widely):-

Aims
Accountability for internal controls must rest with the commercial support 
teams and absolutely with the leaders of those teams.
A culture of control and operational risk assessment requires extensive 
on-going communication and a structure of measurement and tracking.
Any independent process of review such as Doorstep and BRM should fully 
leverage the work engaged by staff in the line and indeed should be focused 
by it
All elements of implementing, completing and reviewing internal control 
should generate defined output
We focus independently the review efforts for trading controls and 
origination controls (we have defined the control structure for trading 
offices, agency offices and origination offices and we must police our 
labelling for each office)
The output from Enron's perspective is appropriate risk issue lists to be 
discussed at control/governance meetings (eg at Sally/Ted/Fernley's level and 
at the audit committee level) - the important issue here is that every list 
must be extracted from an agreed database of issues - different lists have 
different amounts of filtering applied - judgementally by senior/experienced 
staff 
The output from AA's perspective is their internal controls audit opinion 
based upon our database and our review and management process of it

Trading Process - monthly
Routine judgemental self assessment on areas within the trading transaction 
cycle - rating made by business controller is red, amber, green - with trend 
indicator of static, improving or declining - see attachment 2 for full 
listing
Monthly metrics collected for key standards set for risk management - see 
attachment 1 (you will notice that this is a summarised version of attachment 
2 - and as a senior controller I would expect the metrics to underpin but not 
solely drive the judgement within the self assessment) - Shona, this is the 
work that Mike Moscoso is leading
Periodic review meeting between controller and commercial lead to discuss 
operational risk and areas of concern (red and amber) with agreement of 
action plans for such areas
Monthly review by controller/senior controller of database where all high 
(red) and medium (amber) risk issues are recorded.  Milestones for action 
plans revisited, reconfirmed or amended
Monthly meeting between remote office staff and controllers to identify if 
the risk rating for any remote offices has changed
All new information on issues raised by self assessment, doorstep review or 
BRM completion populated into database
Database utilised globally to report to various levels of governance and 
decision on whether original BRM and doorstep plans require amendment

Process - Yearly Planning
Checkpoint taken of
current operational environment (say end Oct)
proposed new offices for coming year or proposed changes to activity in 
office, and
IT development plans for next year
Prioritisation made for doorstep - which offices require a visit and what 
depth does report need to go to.  Note the doorstep review would be an end to 
end review for entire business unit and therefore is the independent review 
of the existing self assessment and would leverage the work by focusing the 
review effort on areas of concern, the actions plans in place and concluding 
on the 'mitigation of operational risk to an acceptable level'
Prioritisation made for BRM - which functions, NOT BUSINESS UNITS, require 
external independent review - highly leveraging the above self assessment and 
doorstep processes (could AA signoff simply by auditing our own internal 
governance process?) - most likely reviews completed on functions that 
assessed as concerns across multiple business - such as FX exposure 
management, cash management, credit exposure management, IT change management 
controls/process

Where are we NOW - if we all thought to do this immediately

We do not have bottom up operational risk assessment for all businesses - I 
am suggesting that we demand that all business controllers at the Houston 
offsite do this? 23rd Oct
The above would validate a high level operational risk summary that we as 
senior controllers could put together for the audit committee - last week Oct
We agree on a robust tracking process - throw out one of the BRM and Doorstep 
databases - November
Given AA have never historically risk rated their issues we should repopulate 
the database from scratch - November
Review Doorstep plan to check that our risk rating for business units and 
remote offices means that we have resource focused correctly - do we need to 
visit all? - November
Review all of the above and blend into risk based approach for BRM planning - 
end November to end December !!

Subject: Enron Metals FX

Rick,

I thought you might be interested in some information brought to me today by 
Andy Cornfield (Director with the London Risk Management Operations team), 
with regard to FX positions at Enron Metals:-

The overall FX exposure of the metals business is not yet routinely laid off 
with the FX / Interest rates desk.  

Euro currency exposure associated with a Euro Aluminium option is managed by 
Tim Jones, the Head of the Metals Financial Trading desk.  This position is 
managed under a limit of $30m, which was MG's old FX limit.   Enron Metals is 
treating this limit as an Enron Corporate FX limit for the purposes of 
managing this position and all other FX exposure.

Proprietary FX positions are occasionally being taken - most recently, Andy 
has found that yesterday a metals trader opened a long Euro 5 million 
position for value 28/11.  The trader is not the principal FX trader on the 
metals desk, although he was formerly an FX trader with Billiton (acquired by 
MG in 1999)  and he became MG's assistant FX trader prior to Enron's 
acquisition of MG.

With regard to the last item, Risk Management and RAC discussed this with 
Mike Hutchinson and it was agreed that the Euro 5m position will be closed 
out tomorrow. 

As far as the first two items are concerned, RAC and Risk Management will be 
working with Commercial heads to help ensure that Enron Corporate policy is 
clearly communicated and applied.

regards

Mike,
Please provide a the Drift analysis for 2001 and the expected new deals' 
impact on the PV of the Gross Book Balance over 2001.

This is  a reasonable request for a the Rate & Currency Group  and I do not 
think I should have to provide you Objectives supporting this request.

Mike and Beth,
I would appreciate a copy of the drift number submitted for Budget 2001 and a 
copy of the analysis for Enron Europe. 

 I would also like a copy of the expected new deals for 2001 reflecting the 
average increase/or decrease in the PV of the Gross Book Balance.  I need 
this infomation in Dollar terms not percentages. I need to have the new deals 
separately for GBP, NOK, and EUR.  We are reviewing Drift and our 
anticipated  Interest rate position vs. expected 2001 economic climate.  

Thanks. Sheila

At the meeting I was told 2 weeks to a month out.  I think they would like to 
start earlier and probably came over here with that intention, but they still 
have some legal, tax and obviously back office things to sort out (so 
basically as soon as commercially possible!).

They flew back to Houston today, so I expect to hear more details in a couple 
of days (after they chase down some legal and tax issues).  In the meantime, 
we need to get with Brenda and her group to sort out the back office details 
as soon as possible.  As you know, Global Products is currently only 
supporting 10-15 financial trades per month (confirms and settlements through 
ECTRIC).

Thanks for the call.  Brenda Herod is the operations controller for EIM. 
(Brenda and Brent in their roles over EIM and EGM, respectively, are both 
direct reports of mine.)  Brenda is out of the country through the end of 
this week on vacation, touring Europe with her mom.  If there is a need to 
address this issue this week, let me know and I can start down that road 
until Brenda returns.  Let me know. 

I did hear an unsubstantiated rumor this week that Clickpaper.com is set to 
go live in London within 5 days.  I am trying to find out if that is true.   
If it is, it would be a repeat of a commercial decision in Houston to do so 
this past July without letting anyone in the mid and back office know.  We 
had to scramble to set up an infrastructure to support that in a big hurry.  
Not ideal.  I hope that history has not repeated itself.  Let me know if you 
have heard anything on this.

Sorry to hear about this one. 

I have some observations to make from my reading (and re-reading) of the 
account:

1 It looks like the old "undue influence" problem again. It seems some 
attempts were made by operations to follow up, but nothing happened. 

We tell our operations staff they have an obligation to dissent but we don't 
have any way to protect them if they do - there is still the fear that if 
they upset a trader they can get fired or held back in their career. And that 
is because twice a year, at the PRC, that can happen. This incident shows 
some of these attributes.

For the operations process to be effective there has to be (and be seen to 
be) little significant influence from Commercial Groups over the ranking of 
the operations staff. 

2 Whoever signed off the new deal lists in the DPR should be asked to confirm 
the basis on which they signed it.

3 Why wait for the traders to approve payments to brokers ? Brokerage is in 
the P&L and if operations are satisfied the trades are accurate and brokerage 
is at the agreed rate, they should simply pay the brokerage.

4 Two weeks to check telephone tapes is unacceptable - it should be done same 
day. I would not have waited for the traders to do it, but I would want to 
know why it took them so long.

5 Given that these (short) trades were absent from the portfolio during a 
highly volatile period of rising prices, I would wonder about motivation in 
addressing the position during this time. Essentially, if it had been correct 
we would have been reporting losses bigger than the ones we did.

I would pursue explanations to points 2, 4 and 5.

Thanks for the note. As described, this is an intolerable situation. I agree 
your action points, but we need timelines and quantitative measures of 
compliance/improvement - please could you provide a weekly update on this 
area specifically and until we are satisfied that things are as they should

On a more general note - let's ensure that the 'Global Standards' address the

Subject: UK Gas late deal input and deal booking errors - o1.1m hit


On the 7th of June Gas Risk Management became aware that two'late' trades had 
been entered into the gas trader's 'Blue book' which were both being booked 
significantly late and had a material negative P&L impact (negative o1.1m). 
The 'late' deals were done on the 3rd of February (Marcello Romano) and the 
30th of March (Haakon Olafson) and were both forward starting sells for 
periods in 2003-2004.

Background

1) Input errors

For some considerable time we have been concerned with the number of deal 
input errors that have been occurring in the Gas area with the most 
significant number coming form the UK Gas traders. Numerous errors have been 
found by documentation and risk management over the accuracy and timeliness 
of entering deals into the 'blue book' (the Gas traders are currently the 
only traders in Europe who do not enter their own trades into the valuation 
system - there is currently a big push to change this which has the support 
of John Sherriff with a deadline date of 31 July).

In the past documentation and gas risk management have repeatedly highlighted 
booking errors to the gas traders but the error rate has not fallen. A log of 
all deal input errors has been formally maintained since the beginning of May 
which highlights an error rate of 12%-15% of non EOL trades. This has been 
discussed with Richard Lewis and corrective action is expected.

2) Deal booking and reconciliation process (Non EOL trades)

Deals are initially written into the 'blue book' by the gas traders when the 
deal is done. This book is photocopied several times a day and the deals are 
the manually input into GasDesk by documentation on the same day.

Faxed broker statements are received (usually) by documentation the next day 
and these are reconciled to GasDesk with errors and amendments made by 
documentation liasing with the traders as necessary. At this time brokers 
were faxing one statement per trade (relevant later).

3) New Deal sign off

As part of the daily DPR process a separate new deal sheet is prepared and is 
signed off by the traders to formally agree the new deals done on the day and 
the implied origination P&L. For the 3rd of February Marcello signed off the 
new deals sheet and for the 30th of March Jonathan Whitehead signed off.

4) Documentation convention

In the gas market the convention is that the seller sends deal documentation. 
(relevant later). Documentation aim to get this out within one the day after 
trade booking.

5) Brokerage invoices

Brokerage invoices are usually received monthly by settlements who then 
reconcile the trades on the invoice to the valuation system to ensure the 
deal is valid before passing the reconciled invoice to the traders to 
authorise for payment. Any deals which cannot be found are raised with 
documentation who then investigate and follow up with the traders.


Specific details of these 'late' trades

1) Summary

For both these trades no evidence can be found of receiving, or can it be 
established that we did not receive, a broker statement which is a primary 
control in agreeing the existence and accuracy of new OTC deals. 

As Enron was the seller in both cases no documentation was received from 
either counterparty which would have alerted us to the trade.

The reconciliation of the brokerage invoices was carried out by settlements 
in April and was completed by the 20th with the invoices falling due for 
payment on the 27th. The work practice at that time was that brokerage 
invoices (including those with non reconciling trade queries) were batched 
together and passed to the traders. This would have taken place on the 27th 
of April. Details on exactly what was said and done in the 3 weeks between 
passing these invoices to the traders for approval (although there are claims 
that verbal follow up were made on a number of occasions) and when a mailed 
follow up was made on the 22nd of May are hazy. What is clear is that on the 
22nd of May Morgan Stanley contacted Enron to try to confirm their position 
which was when it was realised that an error could well have occurred.

Over the next two weeks tapes were then checked by the traders with the deals 
being booked on the 6th of June.

2) Deal specifics

EES Broker - Morgan Stanley trade on 3 Feb 2000
Trader Marcello
EES Invoice date 1 March; Invoice received before 15 March as settlements 
started checking it. (Keren Perrott - settlements started on 13 March)
Discrepancies sent to documentation on 23 May (Chris Ware to Emma Thomson)
Traders contacted  on 24 May after copy of broker confirm was sent on 22 May 
as requested by documentation to prove deal.
Deal entered 6 June after traders checked the tapes.


IEB Broker - NP trade on 30 Mar 2000
Trader Haakon
IEB invoice date 6 April; Invoice received before 27 April as settlements 
started checking it. (Keren Perrott)
Discrepancies sent to documentation on 23 May (Chris Ware to Robert Vaughn)
Traders contacted on 24 May after copy of broker confirm was requested.
Deal entered 6 June after traders checked the tapes.



 Who was at fault and where did the control break down ?

I do not feel it is constructive to try to attach blame for what happened but 
there are lessons to be learned and general observations and conclusions that 
can be made and drawn.

Firstly there are major concerns over the Gas trader's accuracy and 
prioritisation of booking trades. Despite numerous conversations on the 
subject very little improvement has been seen. It has now got to the stage 
where documentation are formally recording all errors including what the 
error was and who made it. This is now being communicated to Richard Lewis 
every two weeks with the aim being not only to reduce the amount of time 
trade support spend correcting errors and re running DPRs but also to try to 
avoid the incidence of errors such as this. The current error rate is 12% - 
15% of non EOL trades. Documentation currently estimate that in 9 times out 
of 10 the broker or counterparty are correct.

Secondly around a month ago we contacted brokers and asked for them to 
provide us with one statement per day rather than one per deal which will 
eliminate any lost statements or missed deals as it will be immediately 
obvious when a statement from a broker has not arrived. Most brokers have now 
changed but one or two still send one statement per trade. Reconciliation's 
of these daily statements to GasDesk are evidenced.

Thirdly it has been impressed on both documentation and settlements to follow 
up more vigorously (and by mail) errors and omissions on a more timely basis. 
There is however a backlog or broker invoices which have have been checked by 
settlements but have nto been checked or approved by the traders. This is 
causing concern at the brokers who are chasing payment.

Action Points

Trading

Traders to input their own deals directly into GasDesk

Traders to improve their accuracy of deal booking

Traders to approve invoices on a more timely basis

Trade Support

Settlements to clear backlog of broker invoices

Documentation to chase brokers to send daily deal statements not individual 
deal statements

All follow ups to be evidenced with mails used as appropriate

Documentation to check all trades since the beginning of the year versus the 
broker records

Documentation to perform a reconciliation with all counterparties to agree 
our forward position from July 2000 to September 2006 (the traded part of the

I had arranged for this process to move along in Europe in parallel with 
Joel's instruction of AA in Houston. Do you foresee any issues here ?

Just to clarify, I believed you would like me to document the process of the 
feeds from the deal capture and valuation systems (Power 99 etc.) into the 
Risk TRAC database which flows through to CAS.

David Hardy was not in the meeting today, but Oliver Gaylard made a good 
point that Simon Sear (ie the Strategic Initiatives) Group may be doing this, 
do you want me to continue with this?

Kind regards

Spoke to Mo yesterday -- sounds like we are on for Wed night -- babysitter is 
all arranged

SO --should I make a reservation

What sounds good?  OXO tower was one that Brent was going to when he visited 
last time (can't take a baby there so we opted for something more casual)  
they have all types of European/Continental type food -- and a georgeous 
rooftop view of the city

Another favorite of Mo, Frank and I is the Gaucho Grill which is sort of a 
European version of Churrasco's -- they serve Argentinian steaks that are 
just awesome with some good red wine -- but if you don't like steaks you are 
out of luck here.  This one is close to the Le Meridian where you usually 
stay -- no view, but interesting decor inside the restraunt

Any others you have heard of that would like to try out?

Let me know and Janine will make the reservation

Mike,
I don't understand the question.  London informatiion was not complete in the 
Corporate system at  11:00 Houston time.  Either London operations or Houston 
operations did not do something.  To me that is the breakdown.  I don't have 
any further knowledge nor do I expect to have any further.  The point of my 
e-mail is to alert you to a reality that I would prefer you not have to deal 
with, i.e., incur the rath of Dave Delainey, John Lavorato, Mark Frevert and 
Jeff Skilling when they understand what happened and based on what inadequate 
management information they were forced to make decisions with.  As I said, I 
am not telling on anyone or accusing anyone of anything but I can virtually 
guarantee the reaction of those people if this were to come to light.  So, I 
suggest that you talk to Sally and create a process by which to insure that 
the possibility of it happening again is minimized.  
Ted

Subject: London Risk Reporting

Well,
today (or rather yesterday) it happened.  We have been pushing our limits 
hard and the makets here have been very volatile.  We had a large increase in 
North American Natural Gas VAR due to the breaking apart the Rockies/SoCal 
basis correlation.  This am, we were attempting to get firm numbers on the 
effect on our corporate limits so that we could provide 
Jeff/Delainey/Lavorato/Buy/.... the information to make decisions whether or 
not to reduce positions.  The number was not firm until 11 am houston time.  
My understanding is that the Houston numbers were all in before 8 am and that 
we were waiting for London.  While I am sure that there are issues all around 
and I do not think that anyone Senior in Houston is even aware, let alone 
prepared to blame, I fear that this will not always be the case.  I think 
something needs to be changed in our process so that this can be avoided in 
the future.   

Please do not take this as a nasty-gram.  No one is cc'd or bcc'd.  I just 
think that it will be deemed unacceptable.
Any thoughts/comments?
Ted

Rick, Rick,

There are three MG offices in North America outside New York which, previous 
to the acquisition by Enron, acted much as trading offices. They are very 
small.
We have worked with the people in Metals to put in place extra controls so 
that they are not trading offices, for example having a trader in a 
designated Trading Office own each book and sign off on profit daily.
This process has highlighted the fact that our non-trading offices are not 
all the same, and cannot reasonably all be the same.
Some offices organise logistics things to happen on the ground, some 
originate (get a price from a Trading Office for every deal), and some 
execute for Trading Offices (are given a range within which they can execute 
trades).

 is a suggestion for how we can make this division explicit.
Tab 'Office Models' shows which functions are performed in which type of 
office
Tab 'Office List' shows the actual offices involved 
We propose to re-examine this methodology in 6 months' time.
Buy-in has been obtained from the cc list and the people on the ground.

It is worth noting that this approach would have caught Helsinki, except for 
the Contract-in-a-bottom-drawer, but no system of control can reliably catch 
that, as was evidenced by EOTT.

Are you both happy with this approach?
Are there any extra controls you would like to see in place?

Thanks,
Richard

Thanks David,

I am addressing the 'undue influence' issue via the PRC process, but we all 
know that this is a partial solution - it's about changing the culture 
(Europe isn't any better or worse in this respect) and this is a more 
intransigent problem that we need to work at every single day (I have to say 
that the Helsinki scare was really helpful in this respect - I think you 
would notice a difference).

I'll ask James and Mike to follow up on your specific points.

Regards

Fernley

Subject: Re: UK Gas late deal input and deal booking errors - o1.1m hit  


Sorry to hear about this one. 

I have some observations to make from my reading (and re-reading) of the 
account:

1 It looks like the old "undue influence" problem again. It seems some 
attempts were made by operations to follow up, but nothing happened. 

We tell our operations staff they have an obligation to dissent but we don't 
have any way to protect them if they do - there is still the fear that if 
they upset a trader they can get fired or held back in their career. And that 
is because twice a year, at the PRC, that can happen. This incident shows 
some of these attributes.

For the operations process to be effective there has to be (and be seen to 
be) little significant influence from Commercial Groups over the ranking of 
the operations staff. 

2 Whoever signed off the new deal lists in the DPR should be asked to confirm 
the basis on which they signed it.

3 Why wait for the traders to approve payments to brokers ? Brokerage is in 
the P&L and if operations are satisfied the trades are accurate and brokerage 
is at the agreed rate, they should simply pay the brokerage.

4 Two weeks to check telephone tapes is unacceptable - it should be done same 
day. I would not have waited for the traders to do it, but I would want to 
know why it took them so long.

5 Given that these (short) trades were absent from the portfolio during a 
highly volatile period of rising prices, I would wonder about motivation in 
addressing the position during this time. Essentially, if it had been correct 
we would have been reporting losses bigger than the ones we did.

I would pursue explanations to points 2, 4 and 5. 

DP

Thanks for the note. As described, this is an intolerable situation. I agree 
your action points, but we need timelines and quantitative measures of 
compliance/improvement - please could you provide a weekly update on this 
area specifically and until we are satisfied that things are as they should

Subject: UK Gas late deal input and deal booking errors - o1.1m hit


On the 7th of June Gas Risk Management became aware that two'late' trades had 
been entered into the gas trader's 'Blue book' which were both being booked 
significantly late and had a material negative P&L impact (negative o1.1m). 
The 'late' deals were done on the 3rd of February (Marcello Romano) and the 
30th of March (Haakon Olafson) and were both forward starting sells for 
periods in 2003-2004.

Background

1) Input errors

For some considerable time we have been concerned with the number of deal 
input errors that have been occurring in the Gas area with the most 
significant number coming form the UK Gas traders. Numerous errors have been 
found by documentation and risk management over the accuracy and timeliness 
of entering deals into the 'blue book' (the Gas traders are currently the 
only traders in Europe who do not enter their own trades into the valuation 
system - there is currently a big push to change this which has the support 
of John Sherriff with a deadline date of 31 July).

In the past documentation and gas risk management have repeatedly highlighted 
booking errors to the gas traders but the error rate has not fallen. A log of 
all deal input errors has been formally maintained since the beginning of May 
which highlights an error rate of 12%-15% of non EOL trades. This has been 
discussed with Richard Lewis and corrective action is expected.

2) Deal booking and reconciliation process (Non EOL trades)

Deals are initially written into the 'blue book' by the gas traders when the 
deal is done. This book is photocopied several times a day and the deals are 
the manually input into GasDesk by documentation on the same day.

Faxed broker statements are received (usually) by documentation the next day 
and these are reconciled to GasDesk with errors and amendments made by 
documentation liasing with the traders as necessary. At this time brokers 
were faxing one statement per trade (relevant later).

3) New Deal sign off

As part of the daily DPR process a separate new deal sheet is prepared and is 
signed off by the traders to formally agree the new deals done on the day and 
the implied origination P&L. For the 3rd of February Marcello signed off the 
new deals sheet and for the 30th of March Jonathan Whitehead signed off.

4) Documentation convention

In the gas market the convention is that the seller sends deal documentation. 
(relevant later). Documentation aim to get this out within one the day after 
trade booking.

5) Brokerage invoices

Brokerage invoices are usually received monthly by settlements who then 
reconcile the trades on the invoice to the valuation system to ensure the 
deal is valid before passing the reconciled invoice to the traders to 
authorise for payment. Any deals which cannot be found are raised with 
documentation who then investigate and follow up with the traders.


Specific details of these 'late' trades

1) Summary

For both these trades no evidence can be found of receiving, or can it be 
established that we did not receive, a broker statement which is a primary 
control in agreeing the existence and accuracy of new OTC deals. 

As Enron was the seller in both cases no documentation was received from 
either counterparty which would have alerted us to the trade.

The reconciliation of the brokerage invoices was carried out by settlements 
in April and was completed by the 20th with the invoices falling due for 
payment on the 27th. The work practice at that time was that brokerage 
invoices (including those with non reconciling trade queries) were batched 
together and passed to the traders. This would have taken place on the 27th 
of April. Details on exactly what was said and done in the 3 weeks between 
passing these invoices to the traders for approval (although there are claims 
that verbal follow up were made on a number of occasions) and when a mailed 
follow up was made on the 22nd of May are hazy. What is clear is that on the 
22nd of May Morgan Stanley contacted Enron to try to confirm their position 
which was when it was realised that an error could well have occurred.

Over the next two weeks tapes were then checked by the traders with the deals 
being booked on the 6th of June.

2) Deal specifics

EES Broker - Morgan Stanley trade on 3 Feb 2000
Trader Marcello
EES Invoice date 1 March; Invoice received before 15 March as settlements 
started checking it. (Keren Perrott - settlements started on 13 March)
Discrepancies sent to documentation on 23 May (Chris Ware to Emma Thomson)
Traders contacted  on 24 May after copy of broker confirm was sent on 22 May 
as requested by documentation to prove deal.
Deal entered 6 June after traders checked the tapes.


IEB Broker - NP trade on 30 Mar 2000
Trader Haakon
IEB invoice date 6 April; Invoice received before 27 April as settlements 
started checking it. (Keren Perrott)
Discrepancies sent to documentation on 23 May (Chris Ware to Robert Vaughn)
Traders contacted on 24 May after copy of broker confirm was requested.
Deal entered 6 June after traders checked the tapes.



 Who was at fault and where did the control break down ?

I do not feel it is constructive to try to attach blame for what happened but 
there are lessons to be learned and general observations and conclusions that 
can be made and drawn.

Firstly there are major concerns over the Gas trader's accuracy and 
prioritisation of booking trades. Despite numerous conversations on the 
subject very little improvement has been seen. It has now got to the stage 
where documentation are formally recording all errors including what the 
error was and who made it. This is now being communicated to Richard Lewis 
every two weeks with the aim being not only to reduce the amount of time 
trade support spend correcting errors and re running DPRs but also to try to 
avoid the incidence of errors such as this. The current error rate is 12% - 
15% of non EOL trades. Documentation currently estimate that in 9 times out 
of 10 the broker or counterparty are correct.

Secondly around a month ago we contacted brokers and asked for them to 
provide us with one statement per day rather than one per deal which will 
eliminate any lost statements or missed deals as it will be immediately 
obvious when a statement from a broker has not arrived. Most brokers have now 
changed but one or two still send one statement per trade. Reconciliation's 
of these daily statements to GasDesk are evidenced.

Thirdly it has been impressed on both documentation and settlements to follow 
up more vigorously (and by mail) errors and omissions on a more timely basis. 
There is however a backlog or broker invoices which have have been checked by 
settlements but have nto been checked or approved by the traders. This is 
causing concern at the brokers who are chasing payment.

Action Points

Trading

Traders to input their own deals directly into GasDesk

Traders to improve their accuracy of deal booking

Traders to approve invoices on a more timely basis

Trade Support

Settlements to clear backlog of broker invoices

Documentation to chase brokers to send daily deal statements not individual 
deal statements

All follow ups to be evidenced with mails used as appropriate

Documentation to check all trades since the beginning of the year versus the 
broker records

Documentation to perform a reconciliation with all counterparties to agree 
our forward position from July 2000 to September 2006 (the traded part of the 
curve)

Sally / Beth,

As we discussed when I was in Houston I have put together a draft on Valuation Methodology Changes and Model Approval. I had a meeting arranged for today to go through my proposal with Ted Murphy and Tani Nath (she heads up research and structuring here in London) but Ted cancelled at the last minute (again). Tani and I met and are broadly in agreement, but before we can go any further we need Ted's input. He is now away for 2 1/2 weeks so there is going to be no further progress on this front.

In the mean time I would appreciate your comments on what I have put together. I would prefer it if it is not circulated around Houston at this stage until I can accurately say that Ted is happy from a global RAC perspective. Likewise I still need to get Houston research comfortable but I am going to wait until Ted has had a chance to add his feedback so I can at least say that it is only Houston research that is outstanding. Others will also need to be consulted (and I would like to agree a list of key people with you) but I can't see their being any real contention. Can you ?

I am assuming that resourcing is likely to be an issue for you in Houston (and it may well be here too) and this has been added to the outstanding list. I am envisaging that some of the risk management work could be completed as part of the curve validation 

If there are any questions or feedback please let me know.

James

I am trying to determine themes ( objectives ) for my visit next week. One 
major theme is our attempt to move forward the plans for Middle Office 
infrastructure development to eliminate volume sensitivity. 

I hope to cover the below document in our meetings - you will see that I have 
tentatively included you as a business sponsor for the initiative - I hope 
you not think this is too forward of me !

Cheers

All
Many thanks for your comments of the draft, I have incorporated these into 
the first version attached below.
As mentioned, this is a 'light' version without all the individual feed 
details and system names etc. intended as an summary for sign-off.
I will tidy up the heavy version so that it can be used to build the 
Elaboration and Planning documents.
Mike is going to present this to Fernley and to Sally Beck for discussion on 
his trip to Houston next week.
I will send to Beth for her sign off.
We need to consider how to wrap Mark Pickering in and to ensure his support, 
booking EnLighten's place on the IT priority list.
Any comments welcome.
Thanks & Regards
Rob

I agree fully with the last sentence.  E mail is not an appropriate forum to 
discuss an issue like this.  This may be somewhat moot given Fernley's latest 
e mail but I believe this warrants direct communication.  Fernley, I would 
suggest you set up a discussion that would include this group and may grow to 
include AA at some point to get their perspective directly.  As I have 
indicated before, I believe Barry is a valuable asset but may need some more 
managing.

Subject: Re: Trading Support Operations - London  

Fernley,
On January 25, 1999, I had breakfast in London with a shaking Richard Sage 
who recounted the tail of Barry threatening his bonus and employment for 
doing exactly what Jeff Skilling told him to do in the previous November.  
Subsequently, Richard was "moved" from his position and Barry promoted.   If 
that is dealing with the situation, this actually reflects on your 
credibility.  If you think that an open communication, independent back 
office message was sent to the back and middle office in Houston and London 
by virtue of your promotion of Barry twice in 12 months, then you are sorely 
mistaken. 
On February 2, 2000 the Arthur Andersen team, including Tom Bauer, John 
Sorrells and Jim Brown stated that Barry was an issue in satisfactorily 
completing the Audit tasks from London.
I am not sure what we are attempting to accomplish here.  You have dismissed 
my "advice" and you need to do what you need to do.
If the goal is to get me to change my view, you have a big hole to dig out 
of.  I obviously can't change your point of view.  I still feel a 
responsiblity to express the views that I have and others are afraid to 
surface. It is the inability for people to be heard and feel that they will 
be supported when they step out on a limb that caused us to lose more money 
trading than we ever have from a little office in the middle of nowhere.
Need I go on.

Let us stop the e-mail wars now.  They serve no productive purpose.

Subject: Re: Trading Support Operations - London  

Ted,

We have had discussions about Barry in the past and I have followed-up on 
specific instances you have mentioned - I believe they date back to 1998 and 
prior to my first hand experience of working with Barry throughout 1999, and 
the people who raised concerns then acknowledge that the environment has 
changed since then. We are not so Barry-dependent. We have a team of quality 
risk management professionals as evidenced by the fact that it is the primary 
recruiting ground for the RAC team (David Port, Oliver Gaylard). 

Barry's role is much less hands-on now and he is not our candidate for the 
Global Products position - this will continue to be Kevin Sweeney. The role I 
suggest for Barry is the high level co-ordination of the operations team - 
his energy, enthusiasm and ability to execute on a plan, combined with his 
considerable institutional knowledge, making a superior candidate difficult 
to find. Frankly, I suggested Steve Young not for additional depth, but to 
address the relationship issue that clearly exists - I do not belittle this 
issue, and while I don't think that anyone can point to any "prosecutable" 
offences that Barry may have committed in recent history, his management 
style doesn't help to promote the view that he is totally impartial and 
objective. I will say that he has always been open and frank (very frank) 
with me - indeed if Mally and Sweeney had been as open we may have had a 
different story to tell on Helsinki.

As an aside, I have not been involved in or consulted on the 'World Tour', 
although I know that Barry suggested this sort of thing to Sally a few weeks 
back. I think it is great that Brent Price is involved, but we would be happy 
to contribute staff to this too.

Regards

Fernley

Subject: Re: Trading Support Operations - London  

Fernley,
As we discussed earlier this year, I have serious concerns about Barry that I 
think are both well-founded and reasonably well documented.  To be fair, I 
will say that since Q1 of last year, I have not seen any FURTHER 
"prosecutable" offenses and he has made some attempts at being more 
communicative.  However, I am clearly unwilling to stake my career on his 
transformation, particulary with as influential person as John Sherriff in 
charge of the office.  Probably more to the point,
it continues to concern me that London has not developed an operations team 
that is not so Barry-dependent.  Evidence to this effect are, the fact that 
he is your only candidate for the Global Products position, that someone from 
Houston has to be part of the "World Tour"  in Europe (Brent Price), that 
your candidates  for a senior interim operations head in Helsinki was David 
Port or Richard Sage, and that your suggestion for additional depth is Steve 
Young.

Further for the record, I believe that I am not the only one with whom Barry 
has a credibility issue - Arthur Andersen, other Global Products personnell, 
and other risk people in London have expressed similar concerns to me - I 
just happen to be the most vocal.
Ted

Subject: Trading Support Operations - London

Rick,

Not wishing to delay the comprehensive review of our trading support 
function, particularly as it relates to our Global Products business, we 
already have Barry Pearce taking a lead in this area.

The issue of concern is whether this should be an interim measure or a more 
permanent solution.  Well - nothing is permanent in Enron and I think Barry 
understands this as well as anybody. If we had a more suitable candidate, we 
would give him/her the job. 

I have seen Barry develop and mature over the last 12 months along with the 
team that we have built around him. I'm convinced that he can add significant 
value by drawing the Global Products support functions 'in to the fold'. 
However, he clearly has a credibility issue with Ted in particular and, 
whilst I do not share Ted's views, I do not hold Barry out as a saint and I 
can see recurring problems if such a key relationship is not well grounded.

I suggest that we continue to search for a candidate - known and trusted 
within Houston, who can instill confidence there. Steve Young (head of RAC in 
London) may be an interesting option, although I'm sure he would not be easy 
to replace. In the meantime we need Barry to take things forward and I will 
be monitoring the situation very closely.

Regards

Fernley.

It has taken a few weeks for me to write this memo, but I wanted to make sure 
that I thanked you for making Todd available to us in London.  Todd was a 
great help.  He provided the experience, professionalism and insight that we 
were lacking on book splitting team.  Todd did a very good job of moving the 
process forward and outlining some projects that need to undertaken in the 
future.  I hope that he will have the time to come back to London once or 
twice to help evaluate the progress made on his ideas.  

Thanks again,

Joe

PS If you have anyone of Todds caliber that needs a new challenge, please let 
me know.

Shona,

Thanks for your task force summary.

Below is what I have already produced here from the London perspective.

Should we not be looking to get more detail of exactly the reasons were 
especially for human errors and highlight those areas where the problems 
arise rather than grouping things together and in so doing losing the detail 
? Also we should try to get some trend information so that it is clear where 
we are improving (or not as the case may be) on both a general and specific 
book basis.

Debbie,

Using the data you kindly sent me I had one of my guys extract the 
performance issues from a London stand point and specifically look into the 
incidence of human errors  as those we can 'influence' immediately.

I am glad to say that the human error rate is very low and over this 
(approximate) 30 business day period and in fact there were only 5 human 
errors on around 120 officialised DPRs.

London IT are also going to analyse the data to try to pinpoint trends in 
their area.

Please let me know if this is informative.

Regards James

Sally,

The May 18th date is locked in stone.  We have already reserved seats on a 
Continental flight @ Noon Thursday, May 18.  It's unfortunate that Mark was 
not kept up to date, but we have only moved back the date 1 time due to the 
May Day riots.  Tom and I have been in constant contact and we have confirmed 
the move-out date.  The book-split project will be implemented tomorrow and I 
will spend the next few days ensuring that the traders understand how to book 
their deals and that Risk is able to generate and explain the DPR on a timely 
basis.  Also, while I am here I plan to meet with the Weather Derivatives 
team to assess their needs and gain an understanding of their markets.

This project will not drag on day-by-day as mentioned below.  There is much 
more that can be done, but that is out of the scope of this project; besides 
I am ready to come home.

Have a good weekend,
Todd

FYI - Sounds as if we can't delay Tom's residence in the flat any longer.  We 
have pushed the date several times.  If there are some other delays, you may 
want to consider flying back with your family back to Houston, and then 
returning on your own to finish the project.  You could stay in a hotel from 
that time period.  What do you think?  Can we assure Tom that you will be out 
of the flat by the 18th of May?  --Sally

Sally,

I need Tom over here ASAP. The flat was given to Todd on the understanding 
that Tom would have it at the start of May. Its now been extended to 18th 
May. I don't wan't to postpone Tom's transfer any longer. Please can you give 
me assurance that Todd will vacate by his newdate of the 18th May.

Thanks

Subject: Re: Move  

Mark,

It's good to hear from you. Sorry we haven't kept you better informed; I 
didn't realize you were not aware of the situation. 

Richard, Iain and I had agreed that it made sense for me and Iain to overlap 
a week either in London or Houston. Since I had commitments in Houston up 
through last week, we decided to overlap in Houston and for me to start in 
London on May 8th.

Sally Beck then approached us about letting Todd extend his stay in the flat 
an extra week since his project was not wrapping up on schedule and since he 
had his whole family with him, so we offered to push my move back one more 
week, to May 15th.

Todd intended to be out of the flat by Thursday, May 11, but apparently his 
plans included working the last weekend of April. Having lost that weekend 
since the London office was closed in anticipation of May Day riots, he now 
wants to stay until Thursday, May 18.

Originally, he suggested that his family would probably return to the U.S. 
the week of May 8th with or without him, so I had proposed that we finalize 
my plans around his leaving on May 11, and he relocate to a hotel if he 
needed to stay longer. Now, though, his family has decided to stick it out 
with him instead of returning early.

Unless somebody dictates an absolute move-out  date to him, I guess we work 
around his *tentative* plan to vacate the flat by May 18 and we target May 22 
as my start date in London. My only concern though, is that his project may 
continue to drag on day-by-day.

Tara needs two full working days to clean the flat, which means Thursday and 
Friday, which gives me Saturday and Sunday to move in. (Depending on how 
strict "two full working days" is, we may actually need for him to be out no 
later than Wednesday, May 17--or even Wednesday, May 10.)

Cheers,
Tom x33926

Tom,

I just heard today that you're not arriving until the 18th as Todd Hall is in 
the apartment. Please let me know what is going on - this is the first I 
heard, and I think its a bit late considering I thought you'd be here today

Fernley,
Generally, this seems to be fine.  I think that Steve and I would like to 
clarify the credit limit review issue.  Please see him for some semantical 
changes to that one line.  
Regarding the expected/maximum exposure calculation,  I believe that this is 
incredibly misleading and if not changed would be inclined to forward my own 
interpretation.    WE LOST $18MM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  - NOT $5MM.  I think 
that we should make a distinction between what has already been realized as 
opposed to what writedowns need to be taken, but it all better add up to 
$18MM.  Regarding the additional exposures, my impression is that our true 
expectation for counterparty claims is close to zero while we do expect to 
terminate one or more employees which would incur severance cost.  
Ted

Rick,

The attached report is an updated version of the document we discussed on 
Friday of last week. Some of the numbers in the exposure analysis are still 
draft and I expect firm numbers in the next few hours. 

My aim would be to streamline this report for the presentation to Joe Sutton, 
but I would welcome your steer on how you plan to conduct the meeting and 
whether or not this format is appropriate.

Mike,
I don't understand the question.  London informatiion was not complete in the 
Corporate system at  11:00 Houston time.  Either London operations or Houston 
operations did not do something.  To me that is the breakdown.  I don't have 
any further knowledge nor do I expect to have any further.  The point of my 
e-mail is to alert you to a reality that I would prefer you not have to deal 
with, i.e., incur the rath of Dave Delainey, John Lavorato, Mark Frevert and 
Jeff Skilling when they understand what happened and based on what inadequate 
management information they were forced to make decisions with.  As I said, I 
am not telling on anyone or accusing anyone of anything but I can virtually 
guarantee the reaction of those people if this were to come to light.  So, I 
suggest that you talk to Sally and create a process by which to insure that 
the possibility of it happening again is minimized.  
Ted

Well,
today (or rather yesterday) it happened.  We have been pushing our limits 
hard and the makets here have been very volatile.  We had a large increase in 
North American Natural Gas VAR due to the breaking apart the Rockies/SoCal 
basis correlation.  This am, we were attempting to get firm numbers on the 
effect on our corporate limits so that we could provide 
Jeff/Delainey/Lavorato/Buy/.... the information to make decisions whether or 
not to reduce positions.  The number was not firm until 11 am houston time.  
My understanding is that the Houston numbers were all in before 8 am and that 
we were waiting for London.  While I am sure that there are issues all around 
and I do not think that anyone Senior in Houston is even aware, let alone 
prepared to blame, I fear that this will not always be the case.  I think 
something needs to be changed in our process so that this can be avoided in 
the future.   

Please do not take this as a nasty-gram.  No one is cc'd or bcc'd.  I just 
think that it will be deemed unacceptable.
Any thoughts/comments?
Ted

I feel I already know you having had the benefit of sitting next to Brent for 
the last few months- but I realise I have been impolite in not organising a 
call just to introduce myself and arrange dates for a visit to Houston.

Additionally Brent, Shona and I have spent some excellent time on the subject 
of Internal Control Enivronment / Operational Risk / Doorstep and I wanted to 
agree potential next steps with you.
Do you have anytime today / tomorrow ?

I have had recently, Cassandra and I are in the process of drafting a process 
whereby we receive information from you and your group to help update our

hopefully lessen the doorstep work required from Mike's resources.

I'll send something to you early next week.

In order  to improve efficiency and segregation of duties within 
International Global Products, a new Coordination team is being created in 
London to take on the Control functions currently performed within the 
Logistics team.

This will allow the Commercial Logistics team to concentrate on improving the 
bottom line results by negotiations and arrangements with outside parties. 
The Commercial Logistics team (Europe) headed by Graham Cane will now report 
to Chris Mahoney.

The Coordination function has been set up by Cindy Horn, who will be handing 
over the leadership to Becky Millerchip on following the implementation of 
SAP for Global Products. This team will handle all paperwork and 
reconciliations with regard to product movements of Global Products generated 
by the London and Helsinki offices, and the further processing of this 
information to the systems and users downstream. 

The Coordination function for Houston and Panama City will be headed by 
Michelle Bruce, with the Logistics team headed by John Harrison now reporting 
directly to John Nowlan.  Michelle will build her team during the third 
quarter.

A similar rationalisation of roles in the Far Eastern offices will be 
announced in due course.

Please join us in congratulating Graham and Becky, Michelle and John  on 
their new responsibilities, and in thanking Cindy for her hard work in making 
this happen.

Sally / Brent 

FYI - no action required

This note and an earlier email ( forwarded separately ) highlights issues 
around some transactions originated within Metals that arose due to 
'misunderstanding' of limits - which was work in progress for Andrew 
Cornfield ( Risk ), Lloyd Fleming ( RAC ) and Shane Dallman ( FX desk  - 
reporting to Gary Hickerson ) working with the Metal Commercial MDs on the 
subject of an exemption from Corp policy for IR and FX hedging.

It is pleasing that people in the control environment picked up the issues on 
a timely basis but disappointing that a firm conclusion between the 
Commerical groups on 'delegated' limits took longer than anticipated.

If you need any detail please call

Subject: Enron Metals FX status

The following issues have been resolved today following discussions with 
Metals Commercial, Risk Management and RAC:

5m Euro prop trade:  It has been agreed that this will be closed out 
immediately.  Metals traders will be advised that FX exposure may only be 
generated as part of a hedge position to an underlying metal trade, and that 
any FX exposure must be laid off via Roger  Murray-Evans (Metals FX trader) 
and the Global Markets desk.

Averaging trades (FX and Bullion): Change method of booking trades so that 
the averaging leg of all trades is booked as it arises (i.e. daily) and the 
resulting FX exposure is captured daily and laid off with Global Markets as 
part of the metals aggregation.

A number of other matters, which have been under discussion for some time, 
were also agreed:- 

Euro / Ali option:  Currently operates under a $30m FX limit and is managed 
by Tim Jones.  It has been agreed that this limit will be reduced to $20m 
(EMRAC to approve) and be a part of Gary Hickerson's limit.  As the options 
expire, the limit will be progressively reduced.  The limit applies only to 
this transaction and does not cover any other FX dealing by Enron Metals.  
Any subsequent transactions of this nature will be covered under separately 
proposed limits.

Overnight exposure: Enron Metals to apply for a small overnight limit to 
cover trades booked after the end of day cut-off.   $2m total net open 
position has been proposed, to be agreed with Gary Hickerson and form part of 
his limits.

FX position management:  FX exposure generated through the day to be 
aggregated and passed to the Global Markets desk.

No we are not planning to do a separate process around exceptions to 
currently defined standards - Doug Imrie is acting as co-ordinator here in 
Europe for reporting into Mike - we are awaiting the standard template for 
consolidation in Houston ( I deliberately did not get my guys to set up their 
own reporting stats !! ).

The below note is simply a PR exercise from John Sherriff to remind people 
throughout Europe ( and especially in Commercial groups ) that fundamental 
standards exist and must be followed ( He believes the message should be sent 
given the turnover in staff and recent arrival of Metals to Enron Europe ).;

I am keen that the basis of the note IS consistent with our global views and 
underpins our global reporting !!

I think the note is fine. My concern would be access to details of the 
standards themselves. People will be less inclined to come to you and me, but 
they may well click on an intranet link to the policies and procedures 
website for example.

For your consideration.

Thanks

Fernley  / Sally

Off and on ( with Jackie Gentle's help ) I have pulled together a one page 
communication note on our fundamental operating standards ( itself a one page 
summary ).

We are in the final stages of this process  - where we draft a cover letter 
for John which will introduce this for inclusion within Globalflash ( the 
Enron Europe newsletter )

Have you any thoughts on draft or cover note ?

Mike

Fernley,
On January 25, 1999, I had breakfast in London with a shaking Richard Sage 
who recounted the tail of Barry threatening his bonus and employment for 
doing exactly what Jeff Skilling told him to do in the previous November.  
Subsequently, Richard was "moved" from his position and Barry promoted.   If 
that is dealing with the situation, this actually reflects on your 
credibility.  If you think that an open communication, independent back 
office message was sent to the back and middle office in Houston and London 
by virtue of your promotion of Barry twice in 12 months, then you are sorely 
mistaken. 
On February 2, 2000 the Arthur Andersen team, including Tom Bauer, John 
Sorrells and Jim Brown stated that Barry was an issue in satisfactorily 
completing the Audit tasks from London.
I am not sure what we are attempting to accomplish here.  You have dismissed 
my "advice" and you need to do what you need to do.
If the goal is to get me to change my view, you have a big hole to dig out 
of.  I obviously can't change your point of view.  I still feel a 
responsiblity to express the views that I have and others are afraid to 
surface. It is the inability for people to be heard and feel that they will 
be supported when they step out on a limb that caused us to lose more money 
trading than we ever have from a little office in the middle of nowhere.
Need I go on.

Let us stop the e-mail wars now.  They serve no productive purpose.
Ted

Subject: Re: Trading Support Operations - London  

Ted,

We have had discussions about Barry in the past and I have followed-up on 
specific instances you have mentioned - I believe they date back to 1998 and 
prior to my first hand experience of working with Barry throughout 1999, and 
the people who raised concerns then acknowledge that the environment has 
changed since then. We are not so Barry-dependent. We have a team of quality 
risk management professionals as evidenced by the fact that it is the primary 
recruiting ground for the RAC team (David Port, Oliver Gaylard). 

Barry's role is much less hands-on now and he is not our candidate for the 
Global Products position - this will continue to be Kevin Sweeney. The role I 
suggest for Barry is the high level co-ordination of the operations team - 
his energy, enthusiasm and ability to execute on a plan, combined with his 
considerable institutional knowledge, making a superior candidate difficult 
to find. Frankly, I suggested Steve Young not for additional depth, but to 
address the relationship issue that clearly exists - I do not belittle this 
issue, and while I don't think that anyone can point to any "prosecutable" 
offences that Barry may have committed in recent history, his management 
style doesn't help to promote the view that he is totally impartial and 
objective. I will say that he has always been open and frank (very frank) 
with me - indeed if Mally and Sweeney had been as open we may have had a 
different story to tell on Helsinki.

As an aside, I have not been involved in or consulted on the 'World Tour', 
although I know that Barry suggested this sort of thing to Sally a few weeks 
back. I think it is great that Brent Price is involved, but we would be happy 
to contribute staff to this too.

Regards

Fernley

Subject: Re: Trading Support Operations - London  

Fernley,
As we discussed earlier this year, I have serious concerns about Barry that I 
think are both well-founded and reasonably well documented.  To be fair, I 
will say that since Q1 of last year, I have not seen any FURTHER 
"prosecutable" offenses and he has made some attempts at being more 
communicative.  However, I am clearly unwilling to stake my career on his 
transformation, particulary with as influential person as John Sherriff in 
charge of the office.  Probably more to the point,
it continues to concern me that London has not developed an operations team 
that is not so Barry-dependent.  Evidence to this effect are, the fact that 
he is your only candidate for the Global Products position, that someone from 
Houston has to be part of the "World Tour"  in Europe (Brent Price), that 
your candidates  for a senior interim operations head in Helsinki was David 
Port or Richard Sage, and that your suggestion for additional depth is Steve 
Young.

Further for the record, I believe that I am not the only one with whom Barry 
has a credibility issue - Arthur Andersen, other Global Products personnell, 
and other risk people in London have expressed similar concerns to me - I 
just happen to be the most vocal.
Ted

Subject: Trading Support Operations - London

Rick,

Not wishing to delay the comprehensive review of our trading support 
function, particularly as it relates to our Global Products business, we 
already have Barry Pearce taking a lead in this area.

The issue of concern is whether this should be an interim measure or a more 
permanent solution.  Well - nothing is permanent in Enron and I think Barry 
understands this as well as anybody. If we had a more suitable candidate, we 
would give him/her the job. 

I have seen Barry develop and mature over the last 12 months along with the 
team that we have built around him. I'm convinced that he can add significant 
value by drawing the Global Products support functions 'in to the fold'. 
However, he clearly has a credibility issue with Ted in particular and, 
whilst I do not share Ted's views, I do not hold Barry out as a saint and I 
can see recurring problems if such a key relationship is not well grounded.

I suggest that we continue to search for a candidate - known and trusted 
within Houston, who can instill confidence there. Steve Young (head of RAC in 
London) may be an interesting option, although I'm sure he would not be easy 
to replace. In the meantime we need Barry to take things forward and I will 
be monitoring the situation very closely.

Regards

Fernley.

Mike,

As a vision statement this looks like an excellent place to start. You might 
want to think about the relationship between business units (EEL, EES and EBS 
- a little political, but what the hell) and with global risk management 
operations. It might also be worth mentioning the standards that we are 
developing and which we will operate by.

Good luck.

Fernley

We have a need for a CRM system, but not a very complicated one, and I thought that the one that Tony Mends demonstrated a couple of years ago might fit the bill. He tells me that it is in your area of responsibilities!

Subject: RAC issues

Fernley

Output from a meeting with David and James on the specific issues :-

David's view is that a detailed factual list of issues is as yet not 
available but the summary is as follows :-

At present Europe is substantially hitting the two key deadlines of 
'officialisation' of the books by Risk management by 6 am Houston time and 
Summary DPR received in Houston by Noon ( indeed have internal deadlines 1 
hour before that for contingency )
However, there are some IT problems in that the feeds to Houston post 
officialisation are currently taking a number of hours - and IT are currently 
looking to rewriting feeds and purchasing a dedicated server for feeding to 
Risktrac.
Additionally, because of the time difference between the two targets and the 
fact that Risk Managament do not obtain MTM information until completion of 
the overnight batch ( ie start working first thing in morning UK time ) there 
has been scope for continuing to work on the raw MTM data. Consequently,
there is potential for Risk Management 'top siding' for corrections such that 
the summary DPR will be 'different' from the risktrac information - We do 
topsides because it is impossible, given current systems, to rerun the 
overnight batch and extract the data from the valuation systems - our p&l 
explain processes are themselves spreadsheet based.
The majority of topsides are caused by inaccurate data capture at the deal 
entry stage - itself a symptom of underinvestment in the data validation 
process of risk systems
Whilst the topside adjustment is communicated to Houston  - Risktrac requires 
a fully automated process
Whilst we should consider the materiality of the topside - RAC rightly are 
trying to implement zero tolerance - to help flag all the issues
Within the last fortnight we once received the incorrect curves on UK Power 
such that the full database was incorrectly valued - there was insufficient 
time ( for reason stated above ) to rerun and reextract and indeed today the 
batch failed because the UK Power server ran out of processing diskspace.

We are doing a reasonably good job given the significant systems inadequacies 
we face ( and that have been flagged on a continuous basis - they are on the 
long list for development ).

The recent daily taskforce meetings will provide more structured reporting of 
the root causes that will allow better escalation of systemic issues - and we 
should seek to discuss these in the context of the goal of corporate policy 
compliance ( we should recommunicate the policy internally within Europe )

What standards does Enron have in place?

- Settlements with counterparties
- Risk management and settlement system information reflected in the genera=

Hi,

Yesterday Debbie and I stepped the P&P group through the Doorstep findings. 
We set the scene, went through the report item by item, and put the findings 
into context, e.g. learning points from Coal.

Collectively, we are comfortable that required actions have been implemented. 

At present the group are on the cusp of transitioning from an origination 
group feeding deals into the Houston risk book, into a fully fledged trading 
unit with physical assets in Europe. Riveria - a potential acquisition of two 
paper mills in Southern France - and/or other acquisitions would be the 
catalyst for this transition.

The group are currently assessing their Commercial, Support and other 
infrastructure resource requirements in order to manage this growth in a 
controlled way. I have sent them the attachment - Roles & Responsibilities 
matrix for Global - which has recently been tailored for a presentation Mike 
Jordan will be making to MG, and will try to stick close and help them 
through this process. 



Any questions, please call.

Regards,
Tim

Thanks for the note

Great to see James - I am really warming to his style and we can do some good 
work on promoting a global standard for static reference data control - more 
to say on that next week

Looking forward to Dallas and am planning to return to Houston for Wed and 
Thurs ( with Steve and Richard  - although Richard is leaving on Wed night ( 
something about Valentine's night and only getting so much time away !! ) ). 
Thursday lunch sounds good - you know I love Mexican!! I will try to buy 
Shona and a few usual suspects dinner on Wednesday 

Speak to you soon - and good luck with the rest of the appraisals

No memo out yet on the Doorstep process.  I am still in the throws of 
completing the 13 reviews that I have to give - should be finished by 5:00.  
I will send the memo on Doorstep process to you, Fernley and Michael Brown 
before I leave for the day. 

I will be in the Calgary office Wednesday and Thursday with Peggy Hedstrom 
and her team.  Back in the Houston office on Friday. 

Hope that James' visit is going well.  Thanks for getting appointments 
organized for him. 

I look forward to seeing you in Dallas next week.  I am glad that you, 
Richard and Steve will be able to participate.  Are you still planning to 
come back to Houston after the meeting in Dallas?  I fly from Dallas to 
Austin on Tuesday night, so that I can do a full day of interviews at UT for 
summer interns on Wednesday.  I will be back in the office on Thursday and 
Friday that week.  Let me know if we can help in setting up any 
appointments.  We can do lunch on Thursday or Friday, if your schedule 
allows.  I can also set some time aside to perhaps download from our Dallas 
meeting and to follow up on some other issues.  I would offer dinner on 
Thursday night, but that is my birthday and I think (hope) that my family 
will have dinner plans for me that evening.  Is there someone else in Houston 
that you would like to have dinner with while you are here?   --Sally

Proposed list - of all potential candidates

Myself
James New - and his lead risk managers
Mike Wellings - UK Power
Coralie Evans - Continental Power
Robert Yeo - UK and Continental Gas
Paul D'Arcy - Structured Products
David Wall - Credit
Tim Poullain-Patterson - Metals Integration
Andrew Cornfield - Metals Risk Manager
Kevin Rhodes - Metals Controller ( there are in fact two controllers at 
present Kevin for Financial Trading and Howard Carter for Merchanting )

I would leave Ralph Jaeger of Frankfurt out of the offsite if places are 
restricted  - He is covered by the mainstream Accounting conferences, but I 
would have Jan Erland, and Heidi and Tiong Hock from Singapore.

I am not sure Fernley would want to be there - but I can ask.

On others  - Simon Thurbin of liquids in london should be in Houston and 
would be a good choice for inclusion. Brent may want his two London 
controllers of Cindy Horn and Kenny Nicoll to also come

Would you invite Kristen to come with( in place of Barry? ).

A long list ( and we may want to cut back ) but all these individuals carry 
the burden of operational risk assessment and management - standardising that 
process would be an achievement indeed.

Mike

PS  - Shall we revisit Agenda and discuss who should start preparing 
presentations - we had thought about engaging RAC, IT etc

Subject: Re: a note being sent out under John Sherriff's name - your thoughts 
on the cover note ?  

I think that it is a great idea to get some press regarding our fundamental 
operating standards, but I wonder about the most appropriate timing, enough 
of a global message ( it is a European note )and the means of delivery.  On 
the means of delivery, I am not sure from your note whether or not I fully 
understand the intent.  Is there an article to be included in an Enron 
publication ( yes )and in addition a letter to be sent under John's name (if 
so, to whom will the letter be sent)?  Or is the letter from John an 
introduction to be included as a lead in to the article?  ( Yes - apologies 
if there is confusion )

With regard to a global message , I think that one of the key points around 
fundamental operating standards are that they are intended to be global in 
nature, applied to every commodity and every location where we engage in 
trading activities.  With these operating standards implemented worldwide, we 
will know as operations professionals that risk is being mitigated and we 
will be able to ensure Enron top management that there is consistency in 
operating standards worldwide.  These global standards also should enable 
Enron to expand its business reach more quickly, with well defined 
requirements with regard to trading operations.  I am not sure from the 
article as written that the global nature of this effort comes across.  
Agreed - but the note was targeted at Europe - would welcome the opportunity 
to work on this with you and Shona )

Finally, a question regarding timing.  The last I knew after you and Brent 
drafted this starting point for fundamental operating standards was that this 
was being circulated (Shona took this to do after Brent's return to Houston) 
for comments to all business controllers.  I don't believe that we are quite 
at the point that we can say that all business controllers worldwide have 
reviewed, understand and have implemented these standards.  And not to 
belittle the process of creating the standards, the tough part (and the real 
meat behind this) will be an effective exception report on a global basis 
against these standards.  My commitment to Rick Causey is that I will have 
that global report in production by the end of the year.  There is much work 
to do in defining the content and regularity of the report and even more work 
to do to identify reliable sources of data for compiling the report.  Shona 
has commissioned Mike Moscoso to work on this, and I believe that Mike has 
already been working with James New.  So I question whether or not you want 
to publish info about fundamental standards that we can not yet report 
against.  Would a more appropriate time be after the Global Operations 
Controller meeting in October when we should have worldwide buy-in and 
commitment to these standards and (hopefully) our first draft of a meaningful 
exception report?  Can we discuss this - please see separate note from me to 
Shona

Sorry that this response looks so long.  I have been interrupted 20 times 
while responding, so I hope that it makes sense.  Thanks for sharing this 
with me.  Since you asked for input, I hope that you don't mind that I gave 
you some.  --Sally  - Certainly not  - and thanks

Off and on ( with Jackie Gentle's help ) I have pulled together a one page

We are in the final stages of this process  - where we draft a cover letter 
for John which will introduce this for inclusion within Globalflash ( the

Have you any thoughts on draft or cover note ?

I think the idea of finding  an efficient way to reference this effort as an 
Enron-wide initiative to define and monitor these standards across all 
locations and all commodities traded is great - and I would hope to reference 
it via the reporting process that shona is trying to roll out.

I will work with Shona who undoubtedly would want to send out ( in your name 
) the global notification of our aims !

I read your note back to Shona, and I understand John's desire to put a 
reminder in front of people, including commerical staff members, about the 
need for operating standards.  If this is the best time to put that in 
writing for Europe, then by all means go forward with that.  If there is an 
efficient way to reference this effort as an Enron-wide initiative to define 
and monitor these standards across all locations and all commodities traded, 
then that would be great.  It simply helps put the London initiative in the 
context of an Enron-wide effort that we all feel is important.  --Sally

Sally / Beth,

As we discussed when I was in Houston I have put together a draft on 
Valuation Methodology Changes and Model Approval. I had a meeting arranged 
for today to go through my proposal with Ted Murphy and Tani Nath (she heads 
up research and structuring here in London) but Ted cancelled at the last 
minute (again). Tani and I met and are broadly in agreement, but before we 
can go any further we need Ted's input. He is now away for 2 1/2 weeks so 
there is going to be no further progress on this front.

In the mean time I would appreciate your comments on what I have put 
together. I would prefer it if it is not circulated around Houston at this 
stage until I can accurately say that Ted is happy from a global RAC 
perspective. Likewise I still need to get Houston research comfortable but I 
am going to wait until Ted has had a chance to add his feedback so I can at 
least say that it is only Houston research that is outstanding. Others will 
also need to be consulted (and I would like to agree a list of key people 
with you) but I can't see their being any real contention. Can you ?

I am assuming that resourcing is likely to be an issue for you in Houston 
(and it may well be here too) and this has been added to the outstanding 
list. I am envisaging that some of the risk management work could be 
completed as part of the curve validation 

If there are any questions or feedback please let me know.

James

Ted,

We have had discussions about Barry in the past and I have followed-up on 
specific instances you have mentioned - I believe they date back to 1998 and 
prior to my first hand experience of working with Barry throughout 1999, and 
the people who raised concerns then acknowledge that the environment has 
changed since then. We are not so Barry-dependent. We have a team of quality 
risk management professionals as evidenced by the fact that it is the primary 
recruiting ground for the RAC team (David Port, Oliver Gaylard). 

Barry's role is much less hands-on now and he is not our candidate for the 
Global Products position - this will continue to be Kevin Sweeney. The role I 
suggest for Barry is the high level co-ordination of the operations team - 
his energy, enthusiasm and ability to execute on a plan, combined with his 
considerable institutional knowledge, making a superior candidate difficult 
to find. Frankly, I suggested Steve Young not for additional depth, but to 
address the relationship issue that clearly exists - I do not belittle this 
issue, and while I don't think that anyone can point to any "prosecutable" 
offences that Barry may have committed in recent history, his management 
style doesn't help to promote the view that he is totally impartial and 
objective. I will say that he has always been open and frank (very frank) 
with me - indeed if Mally and Sweeney had been as open we may have had a 
different story to tell on Helsinki.

As an aside, I have not been involved in or consulted on the 'World Tour', 
although I know that Barry suggested this sort of thing to Sally a few weeks 
back. I think it is great that Brent Price is involved, but we would be happy 
to contribute staff to this too.

Regards

Fernley

Subject: Re: Trading Support Operations - London  

Fernley,
As we discussed earlier this year, I have serious concerns about Barry that I 
think are both well-founded and reasonably well documented.  To be fair, I 
will say that since Q1 of last year, I have not seen any FURTHER 
"prosecutable" offenses and he has made some attempts at being more 
communicative.  However, I am clearly unwilling to stake my career on his 
transformation, particulary with as influential person as John Sherriff in 
charge of the office.  Probably more to the point,
it continues to concern me that London has not developed an operations team 
that is not so Barry-dependent.  Evidence to this effect are, the fact that 
he is your only candidate for the Global Products position, that someone from 
Houston has to be part of the "World Tour"  in Europe (Brent Price), that 
your candidates  for a senior interim operations head in Helsinki was David 
Port or Richard Sage, and that your suggestion for additional depth is Steve 
Young.

Further for the record, I believe that I am not the only one with whom Barry 
has a credibility issue - Arthur Andersen, other Global Products personnell, 
and other risk people in London have expressed similar concerns to me - I 
just happen to be the most vocal.
Ted

Subject: Trading Support Operations - London

Rick,

Not wishing to delay the comprehensive review of our trading support 
function, particularly as it relates to our Global Products business, we 
already have Barry Pearce taking a lead in this area.

The issue of concern is whether this should be an interim measure or a more 
permanent solution.  Well - nothing is permanent in Enron and I think Barry 
understands this as well as anybody. If we had a more suitable candidate, we 
would give him/her the job. 

I have seen Barry develop and mature over the last 12 months along with the 
team that we have built around him. I'm convinced that he can add significant 
value by drawing the Global Products support functions 'in to the fold'. 
However, he clearly has a credibility issue with Ted in particular and, 
whilst I do not share Ted's views, I do not hold Barry out as a saint and I 
can see recurring problems if such a key relationship is not well grounded.

I suggest that we continue to search for a candidate - known and trusted 
within Houston, who can instill confidence there. Steve Young (head of RAC in 
London) may be an interesting option, although I'm sure he would not be easy 
to replace. In the meantime we need Barry to take things forward and I will 
be monitoring the situation very closely.

Regards

Fernley.

We have discovered two positions in the Debt Trading book which were not 
being marked to market. The current mark of the 2 positions results in 
approximately $4.7 million loss.  The details are in :



The primary control issues are:
? Trader did not adjust price to reflect the effect of market movements
? Operations did not perform monthly price verification processes
? Desk management failed to recognize that the marks on these two trades had 
not moved over the term of the transactions (Q1 '00 - Nov 15th)

The losses have been recognized and a full review of the book is ongoing by 
Operations.  The trader has been relieved of his responsibilities and we will 
implement the steps agreed with Operations to ensure that we have a robust 
approach to controls for the Debt Trading book going forward.

Hey Brent,

Jan Erland has just called me from Oslo, he told you & Bjorn are due over 
there next week.

I guess I'm a little surprised no one told me, as Jan Erland reports to me. 
He is Local Office Controller.  I'm assuming it will be a 'post-Helsinki' 
type review, right? Is there any particular things they/you would like to 
look at or discuss?

As you know we operate some of the IBS functions from Oslo and some from 
London. I'm happy to discuss this further. Do your people need an 
introduction to the operation etc...?

Hope your well, Barry.

I am asking my assistant, Lauren to set up a video conference to discuss the 
support services that Enron Europe is providing and how we
should move forward to make these more responsive to your needs, as well as 
more efficient.   We will have a number of classic "centralized versus 
decentralized" matters to resolve and I doubt if one size will fit all.  Keep 
in mind that we have no desire to expand our empire.  In fact, from our 
perspective if our non-commerical headcount got smaller it would be a great 
outcome.  But the way it is has been going lately, we have been adding 
non-commerical headcount at a record pace at the same time that each of us is 
trying to massively expand our commercial business.  

We put a freeze on non-commerical hires earlier this week while we try and 
assess our space limitations and plan for the 2001 budge, so this is 
important that we get your perspective soon on what will work for you.

Global Markets has already moved some of these services under Brent Price in 
Houston but there are many other services which we need to consider as well 
such as:
IT development
IT infrastructure
RAC
Credit
Risk Management
Legal
Accounts Payable
Tax
Building Services
Analyst & Associate recruiting
Senior recruiting
Expat services
Other HR
PR
Governmental Relations
SFA relations
Finance

I hate to think that we will need to form a committee to work this issue, but 
that is a possibility.  If you have any suggestions for a process for working
these issues through, please send them out to this group or bring them to our 
upcoming meeting.

John

Please find attached the most recent update for Merchanting Metals.

In summary the planned systems changes and manual substantiation efforts are 
behind schedule. Additional resources are being allocated and the situation 
is being closely monitored ( both for quarter end signoff and on going 
operations ).

Please contact me if you require any additional information

Subject: Merchanting Metals Update #2

The intention of the efforts and actions documented in my earlier update ( 
see attached email ) was to provide  
a robust position signoff process for total metal tonnage, spread and brand 
and location
a timely substantiation of 
stock on balance sheet
forward MTM 
debtors and creditor balances
OBSF transactional values and a reconciliation of the barclays intercompany 
account

Despite the best efforts of IT, continuing problems with the AS400 
application, a better understanding of the inconsistency between stock 
reconciliation reports, and concerns over the useability of the outright 
stock screen enquiry are such that I am currently not confident of delivering 
sufficient accurate information to AA to satisfy their audit requirements - 
which at a macro level is the transparent audit trail between stock and 
forward positions to full accounting values.

Consequently I need to inform you of, and/or require your approval for, the 
following :

I will discuss with AA the following
that OBSF values within the extended trial balance may be misstated due to 
data issues ( above and beyond existing conversations with AA on model 
simplifications)
that there are reconciling differences between trader position analyses, 
AS400 on screen enquiries and the formal global position report ( these 
differences are at present not understood but would need to be provided to AA 
within the audit timetable)
an outline of the internal balance sheet review process described in my 
earlier note which must now be reprioritised and rescoped ( see MO work )
The creation of an incentive payment pool ( possibly via personal best awards 
) for key Metals staff who continue to work exceptionally unsociable hours to 
meet the above stated objectives
The signoff for additional permanent 'Enron' headcount who will 'duplicate' 
certain key position control processes ultimately replacing some existing 
Traffic staff
A reconciling difference of $15mm exists between the reported DPR and the 
final accounting p&l as generated on the AS400. We will continue to 
investigate potential misstatements in the system p&l, as a result of data or 
system valuation problems, within the month end reporting timeframe. However, 
this difference may need to be adjusted for following a final review and 
signoff of system p&l values with traders.
The recall of all OBSF stock in early April and retention on balance sheet ( 
reduced where economically viable ) until positions are fully reconciled and 
repeatable daily signoff process can be instigated.

Middle Office work being prioritised is as follows
the stock circularisation initiated for close of business 23 rd - with full 
reconciliation of returns to current system data by traffic/co-ordination
an audit of the stock and forward valuation report for the 30 th ( replacing 
planned 23 rd review due to system issues ), requiring
full download of contract detail for later reference
reconciliation of stock movements between 23 rd and 30 th
sample tests of vanilla forward transactions
detailed position analysis of all OBSF contracts that must be reconciled to 
Barclays documentation
spreadsheet recalculation of OBSF option premium utilising the above manually 
created position analysis
the circularisation of Barclays intercompany account and comparison to our 
cut off and substantiation analysis
the debtors/creditors partial circularisation initiated for close of business 
23 rd

I will be in touch directly re the items needing approval

Regards

Mike

Subject: Merchanting Metals update

Several related issues have resulted in an increase in the level of operating 
risk for the Merchanting Metals business.

Complexities surrounding the operation of the Off Balance Sheet Facility 
("OBSF") which commenced two weeks before the year end.
The uncertainty generated by the revocation of AA's signoff for the facility 
late in the year end audit.
The discovery of a number of 'bugs' within the AS400 Merchanting code, 
arising from the release of OBSF designed functionality, which compounded the 
operational burden of supporting the OBSF.
The requirement to amend the operational process and OBSF IT code as a result 
of the current renegotiation of the OBSF with Barclays ( and AA ).
The senior IT developer for Merchanting has resigned and been sent on 
gardening leave.
The Corporate requirement to lower working capital usage for the Merchanting 
business irrespective of the above parochial business issues.

Various mitigating actions have been and will be taken to provide focus, gain 
comfort over control levels and to provide assurance to senior management as 
to the accuracy of the Q1 DPR and business balance sheet.

The implementation for SAP for the Merchanting business has been delayed and 
effectively decoupled from the higher risk ( higher benefit ) Brokerage 
implementation - benefit is to provide sole focus on OBSF for IT Merchanting 
developers.
The AR/AP SAP data quality reviews for both businesses are continuing so as 
to provide a detailed analysis as at end Q1.
Middle Office have instigated a new daily working capital report process 
tracking cash settlement/ funding data to working capital components for all 
Metals businesses.
An enhanced position signoff process will be implemented prior to end Q1 
covering gross tonnage, spread positions and summarised analyses for brand 
and locations. The necessary report functionality should be available within 
the AS400, however contingencies have been initiated to build tactical 
VBA/excel reports outside of the AS400 but using AS400 data downloads.
User requests for additional AS400 functionality and reports have been 
aggressively prioritised and a code freeze will commence prior to the end of 
Q1 following the delivery of three reports determined as minimum requirements 
for the support of OBSF.
A resubstantiation of the full Q1 DPR will be completed by the Risk control 
staff reconciling the full trial balances between Q1 open and Q1 close
A full internal balance sheet review will be completed within the Q1 audit 
timetable which incorporates 
A full circularisation of inventory balances, and matching to source 
documentation within Enron
Inspection of certain of the above inventory balances, by third party 
inspectors, where there is an expectation that circularisation replies will 
not be received on a timely basis
Substantive checks back to source contract documentation for the forward 
priced and unpriced positions report ( spot checking the key position report 
signed off by the traders )
Full reconciliation and recalculation of OBSF option premium values
Full reconciliation of contracts within the OBSF to Barclays documentation ( 
thereby substantiating existence of stock that we have option to purchase ) 
and to AS400 Barclays account
A risk based debtors review - matching to source documentation, where 
applicable, and any subsequent post quarter end cash movements
A full substantiation of creditors to internal ( contract commitments ) or 
external documentation ( invoices/request for payment )
A full reconciliation of intercompany accounts
A full substantive reconciliation of cash and funding accounts

I intend to provide weekly updates on the status of the above actions during 
April 

If you have any questions please call me on x34703

FYI - information for limit extension approval of board - general context for 
previous Continental Power discussions.

Clearly we have 'summarised' issues where possible.

Call if you need any details

Hi, Brent

I have a potential house for you to see if you are interested. It is very 
large and is in a beautiful location right near Hampstead Heath. The current 
occupiers are moving out most likely at the beginning of April and Enron 
holds the lease until the end of June. The commute is approx 35 mins to the 
office.

It is in an incredible area and is very spacious with a large garden so I 
would recommend seeing it. Cost is o1400 p/w plus I would need to arrange 
furniture which would not be a problem. 

Are you interested and if so, can you see it on Tuesday afternoon? If so, 
what time would be best?

Sorry I can't offer it to you, Sally, but we won't have it long enough unless 
the landlord would allow us to extend which is a possiblity. 

Regards
Tara

The London Credit Trading team ( Commercial and nonCommercial ) are currently 
investigating some transactions in the Houston Debt trading book that are 
inappropriately marked ( in fact one is a complex trade that appears to be  
'accrual accounted for' since April ). Bryan Seyfried is in Houston and is 
keen to understand the facts of any potential 'process failure'  - we are 
liaising with him.

The potential write off is, I understand, of the order of $5mm, but I am keen 
to understand the control issues around any 'process failure'

Clearly we need to determine the facts but I thought you should know about 
some noise out there !

Will revert later  tomorrow

Mike

Sally,
Jeff Skilling mentioned today that gas volume growth in ENA was still about 
97% year on year.
I don't know how much of this is increased number of trades and how much is 
increased volume per trade.

We are currently preparing a zero-base estimate of future support costs to 
assess the benefits v costs of all projects.
Assuming that the business in Europe will develop in a similar way to 
America, but a few years behind, it would be most useful to have some more 
statistics for several years back.
Who in your team has some more statistics on numbers of trades which could 
help us?

Many thanks,
Richard
