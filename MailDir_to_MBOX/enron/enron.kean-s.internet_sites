Steve,

I contacted Jane's ex-husband, Doug Smith, and he sent me an e-mail message 
from Jane containing her e-mail address and phone numbers.

Entergy e:mail:     Jane.Wilson@entergy.co.uk
Work number:        4420-7337-8327
Mobile:             44-7730-803-030

He said that in about two weeks, Jane will be here in Houston to attend 
several training classes.

Doug also asked me to pass along a message to you, and I said that I would.  
He lost his job in the recent layoffs at Compaq, and he wants to know if 
Enron could use his talents.  He has an MBA from Harvard.  In the first two 
months that he worked for Compaq, he identified $10 million in savings to the 
company, and before he left, identified another $70 million in savings.  His 
home telephone number is 281-345-4903, and his e-mail address is  
djs400@cs.com .

Thank you,
Rubena

Please respond to 
Steve  --
 
A  question aimed far below your pay grade.  Our most recent invoice to Enron  (dating from April) has not yet been paid.  Our accountant, Paul Hart,  reports that the individual to whom we had previously been told to direct the  invoices says he is no longer the appropriate person to approve  it.
 
Any  guidance on to whom we should turn?
 
All  the best,
 
Nelson

We spoke to Enron's accounting dept who said that the invoice  is still in their system because James Derrick (whom all the previous invoices  have been sent) said that he is not the person to approve the payment. The  accountant asked me whom he sould direct the invoice to. Please let me know your  thoughts.

Per your request, we've reset your password to "password".  Your user id to
Enron Forum remains your email address which we have as 'skean@enron.com'.
Anecdotes from participants and the evaluation forms we have received thus
far show that Enron's initiative in hosting 'US Energy Policy at a
Crossroad' was very well received.   Enjoyed working with you at the October
event and look forward to the next one.  Let me know if you need anything
further.

Hi Everybody!
?
Over the holidays, I installed the CD-ROM for  Mom and Dad's second free year 
of Dellnet service.? Because Dellnet is  combining with MSN, Mom and Dad's 
email address had to be changed.? It is  now rex04@msn.com . Their old 
address still  works and probably will continue to work until the end of 
January, so if you  sent something to them recently using the old address, 
they should still get  it.? From now on, though, it would probably be best to 
use the new address  so Mom doesn't have to retrieve email for both addresses.
?
Thanks,
?

Phil

Subject: Follow-up

Cindy:  As you recall, Steve Kean, Gwen Petteway, you and I met in Houston on 
May 15th to discuss my job at Enron.  It was my understanding that I would 
receive some response from the company within a week or so after our 
meeting.  Gwen has updated me as to the reasons for the response delay due to 
key executives being on vacation, but regardless I was led to believe I would 
have heard some response around May 24th.  I am getting concerned and would 
like to know the company's position.

In addition, the Performance Review Process has begun for my group and is to 
conclude by June 14th.  I have spoken to Gwen as to my concerns as to whether 
I should participate in this review process.  Although I did not select them 
to review me, both Steve Kean and Rick Shapiro have informed by boss, Joe 
Hillings, or their intentions to review me.  Given the concerns raised by me 
about them during our meeting and concerns expressed to others about them on 
previous occasions,  I have grave reservations as to their ability to provide 
an objective review of my performance.

I welcome the opportunity to discuss this with you further.  My number is 
202-466-9143.  Many thanks.

Subject: Career Advancement

Dear Cindy:

 It occurred to me that I should share some addition thoughts and concerns 
with you regarding my situation.

 First and foremost, as I tried to make clear during our recent meeting with 
Steve Kean, it is my desire to stay with the company.  I have invested over 
10 years with Enron and feel that I have made substantial contributions to 
its success.  However, I continue to be frustrated over the fact that I have 
been demoted and that  there has been no response to or acknowledgement of my 
application for Joe Hillings' position.  If I am, in fact , not going to be 
considered for the position, I believe I am owed the courtesy of knowing that.

 I would also argue that I have made significant progress in addressing the 
"communication issues" that have of recent concern to Steve.  I have had a 
number of productive sessions with Jocelyne Gessner, Ph.D. of Personnel 
Decisions International on successful executive relations and management, and 
she informs me that, in her view, my "deficiencies" as perceived by Steve in 
that area may have been overstated.  Dr. Gessner has made numerous attempts 
to call Steve to discuss my progress in a tripartite conversation and he has 
not been responsive.  While I recognize that Steve is extremely busy, it 
seems to me that if he, as he stated during our meeting, really wants me to 
stay with the company, he would make it a point to determine if the issues of 
his concern were being addressed.  If he is not interested in garnering 
feedback about my sessions, one could reasonably conclude that the perceived 
"communications problem" is merely a pretext.

 It also continues to concern me that the restructuring of the Washington 
office has been done without any written changes to my job description.  Many 
people within Enron with whom I have had a long-standing relationship 
continue to ask me for lobbying assistance on various issues because they 
have been satisfied with the results that I have obtained for them in the 
past.  Because some of those issues are now not my primary or secondary area 
of responsibility,  per the new organizational chart, I have been compelled 
to refer those inquiries and requests to others.  In doing so, I fear that 
this could create a misperception that I am unwilling to provide customer 
service to others in the company.  I am sure that you would agree this could, 
in the long run, hurt my chances for increased compensation and advancement.

 The present legislative activity on a number of high-profile Enron 
legislative issues, including the company's top priority of electricity 
restructuring, has precluded me from formally responding to Steve's 
separation offer.  While I recognize that it was made in good faith and that 
it provides a basis for further discussions, I would like to respond after 
the House and Senate mark-ups of the electricity bill take place.

 In the meantime, I would welcome any guidance or suggestions that you might 
have, and I greatly appreciate your interest in my situation.

     Cynthia

One more that I meant to send.  Have a good weekend!

----- Forwarded by Elizabeth Linnell/NA/Enron on 06/22/2001 10:57 AM -----


	Elizabeth Linnell 06/20/2001 08:22 AM 	   To: Alan Comnes/Enron@EnronXGate  cc:   Subject: Non-core state monitoring	


Enron has hired the firm of Stateside Associates to provide State Legislative Monitoring and Regulatory Forecasting services on those states that aren't currently being actively monitored by the department. Stateside Associates is based in Arlington, Virginia and is the largest state and local issue management firm.  It has 50 employees and over 13 years of experience providing high quality information resources.  The professionals who monitor state legislation are all former state legislative staff members and Regulatory Forecasting is provided by attorneys familiar with our issues.

We will receive an updated Legislative and Regulatory report every two weeks.  Everyone on the attached notification list will receive an email alerting us that the report has been updated.  If you're not on the list and would like to be added please let me know.  The list is currently set up geographically, but we can add an issue-based distribution if needed.

At any time, we can access our report by clicking www.stateside.com/istatelink or by following the site link from the Gov't Affairs intranet site.  The Enron logon is phoenix06 (not case sensitive).  This logon must not to be shared outside Enron.  

We will also receive email alerts about our issues.  These will be sent to the designated recipients based on the issue or geography.  

Because interaction with us is very important to Stateside, any Enron employee may contact Stateside Associates for additional information (Special Request) pertinent to the monitoring service.  For example, you may want to learn more about who is lobbying for a bill, what the deadlines are for a regulatory activity or to receive a list of who testified at a hearing.  This follow-up research is part of the Stateside Associates' service.  It will not result in any additional fees.

However, if a Special Request is made that is outside the scope of the Enron program,  it will be addressed with me prior to the commencement of any work.  Again, if Stateside responds to your request, there will be no additional fee - so please use this feature.

Our principal Stateside Associates' contact is Todd Cohn, Manager, Legislative Information Services.  He can be reached at tjc@stateside.com or 703-525-7466.   The Enron iStateLink website also features a roster of other Stateside professionals, including their email addresses.  

You can learn more about Stateside on their website at www.stateside.com.

I hope you find this service useful and look forward to your feedback.

Just to make everyone aware there is a database that is now being offered through E-Source, on a trial basis, that monitors country, regulatory, economic, environmental, legal and operational risk for about 185 different countries. The database claims that it helps its users to determine the quality of conditions and level of stability encountered by investors in each country. 
There is a specific Energy Section. That provides information and analysis on country risk, laws and regulations, industry overviews, and breaks down different parts of the countries energy sector. There is also some environmental analysis. The link to this section is:
http://www.worldmarketsonline.com/servlet/cats?ID=0&subSite=WEO&fromDate=20010822&pageContent=dup&refresh=true
The other section is Country Analysis and Forecast which provides information on many different types of risks and issues faced when investing in a country. The link is:

The Washington Post said today:

Surveys taken for the AFL-CIO found that . . .

* 76 percent of the workers who remembered receiving a flyer from
their union supported the endorsed candidates; and,
* Those who had a conversation about the election with a union
volunteer at the workplace or on the doorstep were 81 percent in support of
the union choices."

You need a strategy:

* Register your employees to vote;
* Get them the information they need to make informed decisions; and,
* Tell them these decisions impact their lives, their jobs and their
industry.

Democrats Tuning Up for Turnout
By David S. Broder
Washington Post Staff Writer
Monday, August 21, 2000; Page A01
LOS ANGELES -- Now that the hoopla of the Democratic National Convention is
past, it's time for Michael Whouley and his team to go to work.
Whouley is the Gore campaign consultant supervising the Democratic Party's
ground war--the man in charge of identifying voters who are likely to
support the vice president and other Democratic candidates and getting them
to the polls on Election Day.
With Democrats hoping for--and anticipating--a close battle for the White
House and both houses of Congress, the margin of victory could, they
believe, turn on the turnout operations run by the "coordinated campaign"
teams Whouley and his partners have been recruiting in the last few weeks.
As if there were not enough motivation in arming for battle at every level
from the legislatures up, the Republicans have raised the stakes by
announcing two weeks ago that they will funnel most of a $100 million
"Victory 2000 Fund" through their national and state parties into a similar
operation, targeted on ticket-splitters and weak partisans.
Democratic officials are not certain how seriously to take the threat and
are skeptical Republicans can match them in manpower--even if they spend
much more on the ground war than they have in the past.
But as Democratic National Committee Chairman Joe Andrew said, "Since we
don't know what the test will be, we are presuming it will be the toughest."
The job of getting people to the polls is harder than ever for both parties,
because of the shortage of high-intensity issues in a time of general
prosperity and the growing public cynicism about politics and elections. But
Republicans have an easier task. For months, more than 90 percent of their
self-identified partisans have been telling pollsters they support Texas
Gov. George W. Bush.
With those "base" voters highly motivated by the prospect of recapturing the
White House, Republicans plan to pour their resources into swing suburban
areas, find out which ticket-splitters are leaning to Bush, and deluge them
with mail and phone calls supporting the entire Republican ticket.
The counterpart Democratic effort or "coordinated campaign" will, according
to Andrew and Whouley, focus more on turning out the urban "base" of the
party, with a secondary push in selected ticket-splitting suburbs, in
districts and states where key House and Senate races are likely to be
decided.
Democrats have more experience than Republicans in running these turnout
efforts for their whole ticket. They have been using this model since 1988,
when the late Paul Tully, working at the DNC, convinced statewide candidates
and the unions supporting them in several key states that, rather than
working individually, they should pool funds and hire staff to register and
mobilize voters for all their races.
The Democrats have been expanding and improving their operation in every
cycle since then, and turnout programs employing targeted mailings, phone
calls and literature distribution, as well as "soft money"-financed "issue
ads," all aimed at African American voters, are credited with powering 1998
upset victories, especially in gubernatorial races in Alabama, Georgia and
South Carolina.
But this year, they face special challenges in the black and Latino
constituencies, and there is some nervousness about the pace of preparations
for the battle ahead.
New Jersey Sen. Robert G. Torricelli, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial
Campaign Committee, said: "The coordinated campaign is late starting this
year. In 1996, we did a good ad program for our base during the summer, and
I haven't seen anything like it so far."
Others, including some labor officials who have been critical in the past of
the youth and inexperience of the coordinated campaign directors dispatched
from Washington to the states, say that this year the DNC has a seasoned
corps of people heading the field operations.
The three top DNC staffers for the coordinated campaigns, Laurie Moskowitz,
John Giesser and Fred Humphreys, all were working states in 1988, when Tully
began setting up the model.
Andrew began prodding states to develop their game plans for this fall as
soon as he became party chairman in March 1999, having been convinced of the
value of direct voter contact during his previous job as Indiana Democratic
chairman.
With Democrats and Republicans tied in the Indiana state House going into
the 1998 election, Andrew targeted 15 districts for intensive voter contact
work and won 10 of them, giving the Democrats control.
With that experience as his talking point, Andrew has persuaded all 50 state
parties to submit their own coordinated campaign plans and budgets. At the
end of last week, 42 states had their coordinators chosen--if not always in
place.
Democrats declined to disclose their budget, but Andrew said they will be
outspent "at least 2 to 1" if Republicans actually put $100 million into
Victory 2000, as they have advertised.
But Andrew's figure does not include what labor unions supporting Gore and
other Democrats spend from their own treasuries mobilizing members and their
families. And it is that union effort which Republicans say is their biggest
worry.
After spending millions on issue ads in the 1996 campaign, AFL-CIO President
John Sweeney decided to switch those resources to a voter contact program,
with dramatic results. The union household share of the actual electorate
rose from 14 percent in 1994 to 23 percent in 1998, according to exit polls.
Surveys taken for the AFL-CIO found that 76 percent of the workers who
remembered receiving a flyer from their union supported the endorsed
candidates; those who had a conversation about the election with a union
volunteer at the workplace or on the doorstep were 81 percent in support of
the union choices.
With control of the House as important a target as Gore's victory, the
AFL-CIO has mobilized 5,000 "local coordinators" in 71 targeted
congressional districts. Unions that are part of the labor federation now
are dispatching staff members to coordinate the coordinators.
Sweeney, for one, argues that "without the machinery and the people we can
deploy, the Republicans' talk of a $100 million ground campaign is really
just a public relations ploy."
That may or may not prove to be true. Meanwhile, there were some complaints
at the convention from African American and Latino elected officials and
organizers about the planning--or lack of planning--for turnout programs in
their communities. One key California labor official, for example, charged
that a half-million-dollar program targeted on Latino voters had been
canceled after Tony Coelho, a former California congressman, left his post
as chairman of the Gore campaign.
Despite the static, Democrats are clearly serious about trying to win the
ground war. Detroit Mayor Dennis Archer, a central figure in the national
network of Democratic mayors whose political organizations will be competing
with those of the Republican governors in their states, said, "Winning this
election is not just Al Gore's job. We're taking the responsibility on
ourselves to get the message out about the stark differences between the
parties this year."
And then he noted, with a smile, "You know, the Auto Workers' new contract
makes Election Day a holiday for their members. Just watch 'em vote."

?
A  question aimed far below your pay grade.? Our most recent invoice to 
Enron  (dating from April) has not yet been paid.? Our accountant, Paul 
Hart,  reports that the individual to whom we had previously been told to 
direct the  invoices says he is no longer the appropriate person to approve  
it.
?
Any  guidance on to whom we should turn?
?
All  the best,

Steve,

I contacted Jane's ex-husband, Doug Smith, and he sent me an e-mail message from Jane containing her e-mail address and phone numbers.

Entergy e:mail:     Jane.Wilson@entergy.co.uk
Work number:        4420-7337-8327
Mobile:             44-7730-803-030

He said that in about two weeks, Jane will be here in Houston to attend several training classes.

Doug also asked me to pass along a message to you, and I said that I would.  He lost his job in the recent layoffs at Compaq, and he wants to know if Enron could use his talents.  He has an MBA from Harvard.  In the first two months that he worked for Compaq, he identified $10 million in savings to the company, and before he left, identified another $70 million in savings.  His home telephone number is 281-345-4903, and his e-mail address is  djs400@cs.com .

Thank you,
Rubena

I also have a free subscription to the PMA news site, which has proved

Good to hear that you're still alive and kicking after your recent world
travels.

You're right about GW -- it wasn't pretty getting there and the big question
will be whether he made himself so ugly that he's too damaged for November.
Honestly, I'm extremely disappointed in a number of ways with the campaign
he's run and especially with some tactical decisions made by Karl and the
rest of the staff who I don't think have served him particularly well. We'll
see if they learned any lessons.

My other buddy, Rick Perry, is going to be in NYC at the end of the month
and I'm helping to raise money for the event. I can't escape.

Excellent choice for vacation. You all will love it. Not only is it great
for us adults, I think your girls will really enjoy it as well. The one
thing I would recommend (before I bring in my file and bore you with too
much) is to try and stay in one or maybe two places and not move to
different hotels. It's easy to do day trips via car or train and it's great
to come back to the same place. Granted, we were there for two weeks and
were staying at a beautiful hillside, 5 bedroom villa with a pool, but it
gives you more flexibility in your schedule, i.e. if you want to take it
easy one day and just walk around the town you're in and have a leisurely
lunch. Off the top of my head (and I will bring in my file) my favorite
places were some of the obvious such as Florence which is good for at least
one if not two full days and Siena, where Sue Mara and her family were there
for the famous horse races in the city square, but also some of the smaller
towns were just as interesting. San Gimignano is famous for its towers that
rise out of the landscape, sort of like the Houston skyline, and do a day
bike ride through the Chianti region and hit at least one winery. We did one
around Montepulciano where we stopped for lunch. There are bike tour groups
that will arrange all of it for you. I would also make the effort to go to
the Tuscan coast and specifically Portifino, one of the most beautiful ports
I've ever seen. And then if you're kids aren't susceptible to car sickness,
I would do the drive along the Chicutira (sp?) coast which is a series of
little fishing villages. This is probably more than you ever wanted to know,
but the more familiar you are with the area before you go over there, the
smoother it will be so I also recommend buying a Fodders, or whatever it's
called. They're well worth it. Also be forewarned that if you rent a car,
they are very small. Fortunately, the Kean family is also small.

Job is going great and settling into big city life very smoothly. Our stock
has been taking a beating thanks in part to your guy, Clinton, and his
interventionists statements that erased $50 billion from the biotech sector
in one day last week. But we'll make up for it when we roll out our cure.

Call if you're up this way. Greetings to everyone on the floor.

In other news, the Bob Jones/confederate flag strategy appears to have paid

I'm taking the wife and kids to Tuscany this summer.  Any advice from your
