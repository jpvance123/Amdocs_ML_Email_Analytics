Thanks for the clarification.

On number 4 is still a little fuzzy.  Does Demarc Deff. get allocated during the
same cycle as Demarc?  Seems unlikely since Demarc Deff. is a storage pt and
storage is allocated at a different time?

If we were nominating our Firm from Beatrice to Demarc Deff. where would our
customers pull from?
The storage that is offered by NNG's park and ride is at what location?  Demarc
or Demarc Deff.?

Please review and let me know if you would like me to change anything you are not comfortable with before I send out to Virginia Power. (I am still waiting on the cities from Gas Control). Jo, you wanted me to get the Plainview South number from planning but see if the way I worded the reponse works.  I will get back to him separately on the fuel language response.

Thanks!

Our recommended language to his request:  

ETS is in the process of evaluating the feedback and system requests from the NNG Winter Operations meeting.  A system enhancement to notify shippers when they have nominated to an alternate receipt or delivery point that is not on their contract is on the list for consideration.  The requirements for this modification are currently being determined, however, the exact method and wording of the message has not been finalized.  It is anticipated that the enhancement will be installed in the first quarter of 2002.  

Let me know if you have any questions. 

Brad

Please mark this time on your calendar so we all know how this is going to work.

Vernon:
Please be prepared to discuss:
   How we have our pools set up should help us or hurt us?
   Beatrice fits into the picture and if this is going to cause additional
   allocations.
   If Demarc gets allocated are big contract gets frozen so we can not adjust
   our nominations
   If this is the case should we release our contract to ourselves in the field
   zone so we would then have two contracts which would allow us to not have the
   same problem as described above.
   Review the amount of capacity to and through Demarc by line.
   Specific example that includes all the cycles.
   Can you have an allocation after the timely cycle?
   Our priority going to Demarc from the Field if we have our nominations in on
   time and do not change them.
   What would happen if we were on time and got all of our gas confirmed to
   Demarc and then one of our customers changes their nomination in our pool

Vernon:
Please be prepared to discuss:

   How we have our pools set up should help us or hurt us?  Yes, depending upon how you set up your pool transactions it will make a difference on how you may be scheduled.  In order to maintain the highest possibility that one would not get allocated through a pool from a receipt location, we do inform our customers that the take away shipper should be firm, and should not be receiving any gas from any one else on the transaction.  The more daisy chain transactions at a pool the less "reliable" the gas becomes during an allocation.  Of course the highest reliability is not go through a pool at all, and go from point to point.

   Beatrice fits into the picture and if this is going to cause additional
   allocations.  Unsure about this question.

   If Demarc gets allocated are big contract gets frozen so we can not adjust
   our nominations  Not sure what he means by "big contract get frozen".  But any time an allocation occurs, the shipper always has the ability to make nomination changes.  The risk is that any changes that one may do could affect the outcome of the allocation, from the previous allocation.  We do recommend that our customers do not make any changes at a point of allocation, unless it is necessary.  ETS can not guarantee they will not be effected, it all depends upon what any one else within the chain is also doing.  The shipper can make changes to either their quantity or ranks, without being considered a new nomination line item.  

   If this is the case should we release our contract to ourselves in the field
   zone so we would then have two contracts which would allow us to not have the
   same problem as described above.  Unsure about this question.  


   Review the amount of capacity to and through Demarc by line.  Vernon's

   Specific example that includes all the cycles.  Vernon's  Unsure about this question.

   Can you have an allocation after the timely cycle?  Yes.

   Our priority going to Demarc from the Field if we have our nominations in on
   time and do not change them.  Should be primary if you have primary rights, dependent upon K rights to Demarc.  

   What would happen if we were on time and got all of our gas confirmed to
   Demarc and then one of our customers changes their nomination in our pool  There is potential that your customer could affect you at Demarc.  Once again it depends upon what his other transaction are at the point.  He can make a mistake that could affect you, we cannot guarantee what his does.

  	Greg, it was good to visit with you yesterday.  Here are the questions and answers that we promised you 
	at the conference call on Tuesday, November 6.  Please review and let Vernon or I know if you need any clarification.

	1.  What fields can be changed on a nomination and the nomination still keep its flowing gas rights from the previous cycle?

		Answer - (1) QUANTITY volume equal to scheduled amount or volume lower than scheduled amount
			  (2) RANK changed to a different number

	2.  Where can I find information on Imbalance Tiering in relation to mandatory monthly cash out?

		Answer - Tariff Sheet 268, D & E 

	3.  What points are in the grouping to determine a demarc allocation?

		Answer - Beatrice (Trailblazer) and demarc are the only two points in the group

	4.  If Virgina Power is transporting gas to demarc and demarc is allocated, can Virginia Power
	     switch their nomination to demarc deferred delivery and keep their gas flowing?

		Answer - The field Receipt to demarc deffered delivery IS included in a demarc allocation
			  because the transport tied to this storage nomination is physically coming from
		              the field to the market area. (Greg we may not have been clear on this comment
			  on the conference call)

	Greg, following are the questions you asked and my answers.  Please give me a call if you have
	any questions. (713-853-7637).  

	1.  Number 4 is still a little fuzzy.  Does Demarc Deferred get allocated during the same cycles as Demarc?

		Answer:  Yes

	2.   Seems unlikely since Demarc Deferred is a storage point and storage is allocated at a different time?

		Answer:  A transportation delivery directly to Demarc Deferred is a part of the Demarc allocation.  
			  When NNG looks at a storage allocation, we review all the injections (or withdrawals)
	 		  at the storage point.  The two referenced allocations are done seperately, but during the same
			  cycle.

	3.  If we were nominating our Firm from Beatrice to Demarc Deferred where would our customers pull from?

		Answer:  Customers can pick up gas at Demarc Deferred

	4.  The storage that is offered by NNG's park and ride is at what location?  Demarc or Demarc Deferred?

		Answer:  Demarc Deferred

	Hopefully this helped.  Thanks. Lynn

This notice is for Market Area Deliveries.  If you are not delivering in the Market Area, then this shouldn't impact you.  The DDVC penalties are assessed on the Shipper.  If you are not the Shipper and are only selling gas to a Shipper, again, you should not be impacted.  If your supply cut causes a Shipper to incur penalties, then the recourse for the Shipper may be in the sales contract which is between you and the Shipper.

How would this hurt us if we were only selling gas at Demarc, or other pooling
pts?  Not at all correct?
