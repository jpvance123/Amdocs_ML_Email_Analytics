John,

The outline of a message to Nesbitt.


Dale,

Thanks for your message. In our phone conversation before the meeting  you 
mentioned 
another contractual arrangement under which we could work with  your  company 
employees on a case-study.

The cost of a weekly project  would be $12,000 that would be applied to the 
purchase price should
we go ahead and decide to acquire the software. This project would allow us 
to evaluate the model and
come up with an estimate of the manpower necessary to support  the model 
internally.

Please, let me know more about this option.

Vince

Steve,


Please, let  me know when you come back.

I have detected a tendency to implement different

approaches to valuation in the past.


To some extent, it reflects the absence of formal

rules for sign-off on the valuation techniques

which, in turn, reflects,  the turf wars and the desire by the

originators to control the outcomes.

Vince,


I'd like an opportunity to talk to you about valuation.


I'm hearing confusing messages about the way that the UK IT team and the UK

traders get their Valuation code aparently signed off by Research, while

here... You provide it for our guys to wrap up.


We have now a situation where the UK team are using a home grown Valuation

piece called DOVE, where results differ from those of the equivalent USA

portcalc.


I need to break through the pride barriers and the "not built here"

syndrome, and try to do the right thing, but I don't beleive I can do that

without you guidance.


I'm scared that if we diverge too much we will never work globally on these

systems.

Subject: MarketPoint License Agreement


John/Vince:

I really enjoyed the meeting the other day with you and a broad cross
section of your people.  Thank you very much for setting it up, and thank
you for giving me the opportunity to speak with your people.

As I mentioned to John, I am sending you the license paperwork for
MarketPoint.  I have attached our standard license agreement for your
consideration.  As I mentioned, the license agreement covers the entire
bundled product, which includes

? North American gas, short and long term
? North American electricity, short and long term
? World gas
? Western European gas
? World oil

We are just finishing porting the world oil, world gas, and western Europea=
n
gas models over from our old (now obsolete) software system into
MarketPoint, so they will not be fully tested and complete for a couple of
months.  However, the gas and electricity models for North America are
presently complete and tested.  That should allow us to give you an
attractive price before the full worldwide toolkit is available throughout
your worldwide business.

As I understood it, you will want the gas modeling capability first and wil=
l
want to defer decisions on electric or other capability.  As I mentioned at
the meeting, we are prepared to offer that for approximately=20
 the fully
bundled price.  As you read the license agreement, you will see that the
software licenses for $100,000 annually, the gas data for $5,000, and the
electric data for $10,000.  MarketPoint will agree to license you the gas
model plus the data for=20
 the software license plus the data license for a
total of $55,000 annually.  This is just under=20
 the fully bundled price.  I
think that is consistent with the discussions at our meeting, and from
MarketPoint=01,s perspective would provide a great basis to move forward
together with Enron.  If or when Enron ever desires to =01&scale up=018 to =
another
model or model(s) from the MarketPoint portfolio, we will simply scale you
up to the entire license agreement.  This will allow you to decouple the ga=
s
decision from any other decisions you might make.  (I will be glad to put
this additional pricing provision into the agreement if you decide to move
forward.)

I felt I was able to communicate the philosophy, scope, and operation of ou=
r
approach during the meeting and to deliver you much of the information you
might need to evaluate whether MarketPoint meets your needs.  I thought you
were able to see the depth and sophistication of the product yet at the sam=
e
time its simplicity and effectiveness.  I thought you were able to see the
benefits of the MarketPoint dimension of economic equilibrium as a
complement and supplement to other approaches you will assuredly use.  I
would be interested in your impressions and those of your colleagues.  I
look forward to your response and to moving ahead together.  We view you as
a very important prospective customer and client and will work with you to
earn and secure your business.

If you decide to license MarketPoint, we can arrange to transfer and mount
MarketPoint and the short term NARG model (which is the model we suggest yo=
u
begin with) and travel to Houston to deliver our 1=20
 day training seminar.
Our clients are usually very fluent after that 1=20
 day training seminar.
Thereafter, we would want you to work with the short term NARG model for a
few weeks while you get up to speed, very fluent, and very comfortable
before you take delivery of the longer term version of NARG several weeks
later.

Thanks again, and all the best.  If there is some item from the meeting tha=
t
I might have forgotten to send, please remind me.  My notes don't show
anything, but I was speaking a lot rather than writing notes during the
meeting and might have overlooked something someone wanted.

Paul,

Vince and I spent some time thinking about the diligence process for the 
trading analytics.   There is a limited amount that can be accomplished in a 
two day time period.   I think a reasonable start would be the following:

1.  Obtain an audited history of the trading strategies which have been 
implemented in order to verify profitability, and P/L volatility of each.
2.  Review needed working capital and risk capital requirements and compare 
these to projections for trading income.
3.  Review current level of access to electronic markets and verify that a 
change of ownership would not have adverse consequences, i.e. are there 
guarantees of continued access using the current systems?
4.  Review feasibility of entry into proposed new markets?   It is far from 
clear that there will be any synergy with most commodity markets given the 
current limited "electronic" liquidity.
5.  Review, at least qualitatively, the current trading strategies being 
used.   Try to develop some estimate of how fast the profitability of these 
strategies will disappear as other's implement similar trading models.   What 
is the trade off between trade quantity and slippage.
6.  Review the methodology used to generate new trading strategies which will 
be needed to replace the current models as they become unprofitable and 
outdated.
7.  Try to determine if there will be any value in transfer of trading 
technology to Enron's other markets, given the illiquidity of these markets 
as compared to the financial equity markets.

If there were a sufficiently long time horizon for our analysis, we would 
probably want to run their system on a test set of data.

Let me know if you have other suggestions.

--Stinson

Gentlemen,

I recommend that we purchase this package and split the cost 3 ways between 3 
power trading desks.
I think that we should go for option 3 (~ $15,000).

Lance Cunningham in my group looked at this software package and found it 
very useful for modeling transmission problems.
Please, feel free to ask him for technical details in support of this 
recommendation.

Vince

Subject: Site License for Power World

Vince,

We have three options to increase our availability across Enron for the Power 
World load flow software.

Option 1, Upgrade to a site license for the load flow software only. Price 
$9,990.00 
This would give all of Enron the ability to perform load flows, but not 
determine marginal cost or available transfer capacity (ATC) because only the 
Optimal Power Flow (OPF) version can perform that task.

Option 2, Site license for the load flow and purchase 1 OPF package for 
Walter Coffer's group.  Price $11,240.
This would give all of Enron  the ability to perform load flows and one other 
group the ability to determine marginal cost and ATC.

Option 3, Site license for load flows, OPF and ATC.  Price $14,990.00
This would give all of Enron  the ability to perform load flows, marginal 
cost, and ATC.

Regards,
Lance

I talked to Vince about the optimization software issue. Vince said that if 
there are technical reasons for having two different packages and the 
benefits outweigh the costs of maintaining two licenses, we can go ahead and 
buy both. In my view, it is a great advantage to have both, as each has its 
own strengths relative to the other. We have spent some time trying to come 
up with one package that solves all of our problmes without success. There is 
no point is wasting more time on this effort. Let's go ahead and purchase 
both.

Subject: Re: CPLEX  

Tom,
Vince prefers to have one software package (if possible). It is my 
understanding that special ordered sets are recognized automatically 
(internally) by Cplex. This seems to be the case for both Cplex and OSL 
according to AMPL's web page and other references (check 
http://www.ampl.com/cm/cs/what/ampl/FAQ/index.html#HowcanIusethesolver'sspecia
lorderedsetsfeature). As a result, the Cplex people feel that there is no 
need to provide the user with the tools to represent special-ordered sets in 
OPL. As a matter of fact, the incapability of Xpress to recognize them 
automatically concerns me. 
If you have special requirements, C code may be used to pass the information 
to the solver (which is straight forward; all of Chonawee's testing was done 
this way). Chonawee's benchmark shows a superior performance by Cplex (which 
you indicated yourself in an earlier message).
If you feel that Xpress is the only way to go, then feel free to purchase it 
(the purchase order is on hold for the time being). However, we need to check 
with Vince first. I strongly feel that we should have one solver in order to 
minimize cost and contractual headaches.
Let us try to get this issue resolved by this afternoon. Thanks.
-Samer

Goodmorning ,

Shirley  , we are in need of a printer that will allow us to print
several  pages , none of the printers on this floor will permit
us to do that without adding memory.

I even sent the print-out to Bandit and it also needs more memory to 
print these pages. 
What we are printing is 189 pages.

Mike would like to print these pages , so instead of paying for 
memory on someone else's printer could we add memory to 
one of our own.

Please inform..........

Hello Vince :

Myself, Eugene McGoldrick, and Rick Baker are looking forward to meet with
you and your group on 10/18 at 2:00pm.  Eugene is the Financial Products
Program Manager and Rick is a financial engineer and author of several of
toolboxes.

We want to understand the needs of your group to better demonstrate the
proper tools.  Do you or members of your group have specific applications
that we can address?  Please email me those items and I will coordinate the
presentation with our group.

We would like to demonstrate how our tools can be used to rapidly develop
applications, be integrated with databases and other applications ( OLF,
ODBC databases, Excel, VB, etc.) and then deploy those applications at no
cost to your traders and analysts.

I look forward to meeting you, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Thanks
Scott

I met Lou in the building lobby last Wednesday and he suggested that he
(or his representatives) join the Mathworks presentation to my group).

It's a good software package for mathematical modeling,
 but there is a limit to the number of different installations any group
can productively use.

I shall take a look at some new features they offer
and decide whether it's worth the effort.

Hi Karolina,

The last word I got was that Grant Masson was still coordinating the contract 
and would be the person to talk to about getting a copy of the license.  I 
checked to see if I had an electronic copy somewhere, but couldn't find 
anything.  I suspect my copy was paper, and it would have been returned to 
Grant when I went back to Portland General Electric.  Probably didn't speak 
to the situation in London, anyway, because the real interest in London 
didn't arise until after I would have gotten my copy.

Grant is transitioning to his new job with El Paso in London, so if you have 
difficulty reaching him, check with Vince Kaminski, or if Vince is 
unavailable, Shriley Crenshaw.  Shirley may know the person in Enron Legal or 
Contracts Admin. who worked with Grant on the Henwood license.

Of course, Eric T. would have a copy.  If you run into problems with Houston, 
have Eric send you a fax.  (The license is relatively short as contracts go.)

Hope this helps,
Michael

Two weeks ago I attended HESI Client Symposium followed by Advanced PROSYM 
course in Sacramento.  During that time I had an opportunity to get to know 
several people from both Henwood Energy Services support and development 
groups.  One of them was Eric Toolson - Head of Client Support in HESI, with 
whom I discussed some issues in regards to our liaison with London based 
support team.  I agreed to meet up with Simon Crisp back in London to agree 
on a form of our working relationship.

Before I go to the meeting I would like to find out the following:

the text of Enron's PROSYM license
what service we are entitled to based on the license

I am not sure if you are the person to ask about the above but if you could 
help me by either providing the license or directing to the appropriate 
person within Enron it would be much appreciated.

Many thanks

Karolina

New GPCM Pipeline Schematics Available on the Web

You can now view GPCM pipeline schematics on the web by going to the GPCM
website, clicking "GPCM Pipelines" and then clicking the code for the
pipeline you want.  You can also go to that pipeline's website by clicking
it's URL.  Finally, by "right-clicking" the code you can copy the pipeline

  Natural Gas Markets in Mexico

  Natural gas demand in Mexico in the coming years could grow by up to 8%
annually. Such demand could lead to natural gas imports approaching 2 Bcf
per day, according to government forecasts. In response, Pemex proposes two
actions: The first consists of measures to increase cross-border pipeline
infrastructure and capacity such as a new pipeline being built by Coral
Energy into Pemex's supply hub at Reynosa. The possibility of a new
pipeline to Monterrey is still an option. A second measure is to implement
a gas-centric exploration and production program focused on five areas, two
of which are dry natural gas basins, Burgos and Macuspana. This second
measure is intended to reduce projected imports by up to 80%. At present,
Pemex's 10-year strategic plan does not contemplate a role for private
production companies in capacities other than that of technical assistance.

DECEMBER 2000  Financial Engineering Associates, Berkeley, CA



Gentlepeople,

As the end of the year rapidly approaches, it seems timely to thank you for
your business this year.  Thank you for helping to make this the best year
ever for FEA!

And, wed also like to wish you Happy Holidays and a healthy and prosperous
New Year.

Earlier this year, FEA initiated =0F3Virtual Coffee Break=0F4, an emailed
newsletter for FEA Alliance Partners.  It has proven to be a popular and
useful media to share information.  This is our first effort at an emailed
newsletter to FEA clients, =0F3Afternoon Tea with Tracie).   We hope you wi=
ll
take a few minutes to skim it for pertinent information  and then move it t=
o
your FEA file folder for future reference.


***ANNOUNCING FEA PRODUCT UPDATES!***

FEA has been extraordinarily busy running extensive testing on new releases=
.
The following should be available to all clients, who are current on
maintenance, in just a couple weeks.  We will send an email notification of
the availability of the release, and CDs will be shipped.  If you prefer,
email support@fea.com to request download instructions.

@ENERGY. 2.0 will feature the release of the Forward Curve Builder and the
Swing (take or pay) Options valuation module. The Forward Curve Builder, as
its name suggests, calibrated the forward price curve for power
(electricity) and other commodity markets.  Some additional new features in
the 2.0 release include a Jump Diffusion Model for European-style options,
an option on a strip of options and an option on a strip of spread options.

VaRworks 4.0 includes sophisticated Stress Testing, support for individual
equities, and new easier to use templates.  Eagerly awaited by FEA clients,
the addition of Stress Testing capabilities has been a top priority for
FEA's engineering team.  Fund managers will be happy to hear that individua=
l
(sectorial) equities are now supported in VaRworks. 4.0.

If you do not own a license for @ENERGY or VaRworks, and want to evaluate
them, email sales@fea.com and request a 30 day demo.  Product demos are fre=
e
to existing FEA clients.  Curious about a product, but dont have time to
install a demo, read the instructions and experiment?  Visit
www.fea.com/demos.htm and select alternative one.  We can now demo FEA
software on your computer screen, via the internet.


***LIST of CURRENT VERSIONS of FEA PRODUCTS NOW POSTED ON-LINE!
You may refer to www.fea.com/support.htm for details of the most current FE=
A

4th US Patent! Patent 6,122,623 recognizes the "Watershed Method"as FEA's
second US Patent defining cutting-edge methodologies for VaR. The importanc=
e
of the recent invention is that it will allow market risk to be more
accurately allocated into accounting periods. Mark'sprior patent in the VaR
arena pertained to the calculation of "marginal VaR" or "Component VaR,"
which allowed risk managers to "slice and dice," or dissect enterprise-wide
VaR into its constituent components. (See the PressRelease at
www.fea.com/pdf/watershed_pr.pdf).
*** FIRST BETA SITE FOR VARWORKS SE***   www.fea.com/press_rm.htm
Look for a Press Release announcing  the first beta site for FEAs VaRworks.

environment will enable the delivery of  customized risk profiles to dozens
of exchange participants.  (See the product description at
http://www.fea.com/p_varse.htm.)

*** DID YOU HEAR?????
RiskMetrics, as of 1/15/2001, will be charging for their previously free
data sets.   Only outdated data sets will be available at no charge.

utilizing historical time series data that you may already have available t=
o
you.  You may request a FREE 30 day demo of MakeVC from
www.fea.com/demos.htm.  Product demos are free to existing FEA clients.

***PLAN AHEAD

Hi Lyn:

I have not received an answer for the below request for another Sun
computer.  Did you get it?

We also need to order another regular computer like the others that have
been supplied to the Research Group.  It will be for Tanya Tamarchenko
and her location on the 19th floor is EB 1940.  Tanya has two offices and
does not have a computer in her office on the 19th floor.

Co# 0011 - RC# 100038

Thanks!

Hi Shirley,
I would like to request for a new PC.  My current PC is quite old with not 
enough memory.  Twice 
I ran out of memory and had to have IT people coming to clean it for me. 
Their suggestion is
to either get a new hard drive or a new PC.  Given that Dell has Pentiumc III 
Processor at 800 MHz
on market, I would like to request a PC with process at 500 MHz or higher 
level. 
Thank you very much.

Best,
Alex

Hi Iain:

Got a questions for you?  We have a small copier in our Research area
(a Minolta CSPro)  that stays on the blink somewhere, quite a bit of the
time.  The temporary copier in 19K1 is a Kodak Image Source 50.  What
is the difference in price of these two copiers?  Is there any way we could
exchange the Minolta for the Image Source when you bring our permanent
copier to 19K1?

Please let me know.  We would like to do that if we can and it is not too much
more money.

Thanks and have a great day!

Shirley

Some notes on the upcoming Java class.   We have an extremely high interest 
in the class, which is good, but since we are limited to 15 students, not 
everyone who expressed an interest could be accomodated.

Those registered are:

1 Martin Lin
2. Chonawee
3. Tom Barkley
4. Lance Cunningham
5. Seksan Kiatsupaibul
6. Wichai Narongwanich
7. Praveen Mellacheruvu
8.  Sevil Yaman
9.  Stephen Bennett
10. Sam Smith
11. Jason Sokolov
12. Jaesoo Lew
13. Amitava Dhar
14.  George Hopley's group
15.  George Hopley's group

Each person taking the class will need to find a laptop computer (Shirley may 
be able to help) and be sure that the proper software is installed before the 
course.   Chonawee will try to install the s/w on his laptop as a test case.  

The class is divided into two weeks.   Each week consisting of 4 days,   noon 
to 5 P.M.    The first four days are Feb 20-23, so mark your calendars.   The 
classes in Feb. will be in 30C1 (Tuesday) and 30C2 (remainder of the week).

IF YOU CAN NOT ATTEND PLEASE LET ME KNOW, so that others who want to take the 
class can take your place.

Gentleman,

Kevin Presto concurred on the purchase of a site license as recommended by 
Vince.  What are the thoughts of others?  I am available to demo the package 
if others would like to see it.

Thanks,

Gentlemen,

I recommend that we purchase this package and split the cost 3 ways between 3 
power trading desks.
I think that we should go for option 3 (~ $15,000).

Lance Cunningham in my group looked at this software package and found it 
very useful for modeling transmission problems.
Please, feel free to ask him for technical details in support of this 
recommendation.

Vince

Subject: Site License for Power World

Vince,

We have three options to increase our availability across Enron for the Power 
World load flow software.

Option 1, Upgrade to a site license for the load flow software only. Price 
$9,990.00 
This would give all of Enron the ability to perform load flows, but not 
determine marginal cost or available transfer capacity (ATC) because only the 
Optimal Power Flow (OPF) version can perform that task.

Option 2, Site license for the load flow and purchase 1 OPF package for 
Walter Coffer's group.  Price $11,240.
This would give all of Enron  the ability to perform load flows and one other 
group the ability to determine marginal cost and ATC.

Option 3, Site license for load flows, OPF and ATC.  Price $14,990.00
This would give all of Enron  the ability to perform load flows, marginal 
cost, and ATC.

Regards,
Lance

Vince:

The IT Migration team called and said that they need an email from you
stating that you do not want your lap top "Ghost upped"? (Not sure if this
is the correct term).   They said they were supposed to do this to all 
computers during the migration process, but since you requested that 
they not do this, then they need an email from you with this request.

You need to send the email to:     Kacee Downey/Enron@EnronXGate

Thanks!

Dear Ms. Geman,

I met with Vince Kaminski yesterday regarding picking back up with the 
license agreement we were working on back in March.  He relayed some 
additional requirements which need to be added to the agreement, which 
include the following:

 1. The price agreed upon is $90,000.
 2. D-G will provide system support.
3. No later than 12 months of execution of the agreement, D-G will provide 
the source code to Enron.  In the meantime, the source code is to be in 
escrow.  Additionally, the source code would be released sooner than the 12 
months if any of the following conditions occur:  (i) D-G goes out of 
business; (ii) D-G is unable to provide effective technical support; or (iii) 
if D-G agrees to release it sooner.

Before I have our attorney add these things to the agreement, we need to 
discuss the escrow situation.  Vince mentioned that you had suggested that 
your attorney keep the software in escrow.   Is your attorney a U.S. 
attorney?  It seems like I may have recalled that way back in March you might 
have said you had a friend or relative that was an attorney.  Is that the 
same person?  Does this attorney work for a large firm, small firm, or solo 
practitioner?  Basically, if you could just provides some additional 
information about your attorney, I would appreciate it.

We normally would use an Escrow company to put the software in escrow.  We 
have dealt with a company here in the U.S. called DSI Technology.  I will 
check into that pending your answer regarding your attorney.

Once we decide what we want to do regarding placing the software in escrow, 
we will red-line the agreement to reflect such changes and e-mail it back to 
you for your review.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Hi Shirley,
I would like to request for a new PC.  My current PC is quite old with not 
enough memory.  Twice 
I ran out of memory and had to have IT people coming to clean it for me. 
Their suggestion is
to either get a new hard drive or a new PC.  Given that Dell has Pentiumc III 
Processor at 800 MHz
on market, I would like to request a PC with process at 500 MHz or higher 
level. 
Thank you very much.

Best,
Alex

Stinson,

I have attached a file along with this email
that lists the software needed for our
Java class.

We would like to do the class from Monday thru
Friday, 8 AM to 5 PM.  That way we can complete
the class within a  week.  We are unable to offer
classes in the evenings or for few hours a week.
We usually teach week long courses for our
other clients and because of that  we won't
be available.

Currently, we can do the class from Feb. 19th
through Feb. 23 (that is if you are working on
Feb 19th, President's day).

I will call  you sometime this afternoon to talk
further.  Please feel free to reach me if you have
any further questions in the mean time.

Regards,

- Siva

Zmin,

I spoke with the provider of this software.  Am I to understand that there is 
only one concurrent user server licence for this software?  

I am almost completed and would like to test this out.  Let me know, thanks.

@ENERGY (Basics)
Different interpolation schemes on forward prices are now supported. If you
use INDEXSWAP , EXOTICSWAP, or OPTINDEXSWAP with floating price linked to a
series of futures dates, such futures dates need not be close to dates
specified in the forward curve input.  A new utility function, PATHUTIL,
allows you  to simulate and visualize price paths consistent with the models
supported by @ENERGY. 25-30% speed improvement.

@ENERGY (Advanced)
Different interpolation schemes on forward prices are now supported. If you
use OPTDIFFSWAP or DIFFSWAP  with floating price linked to a series of
futures dates, such futures dates need not be close to dates specified in
the forward curve input. CALSPREADOPT now allows for the specification of
two different mean reversion rates. 30-35% speed improvement.

@ENERGY (Swing)
SWINGOPT and STRIPSWINGOPT now allow for valuation of swing straddle
contracts with overall load constraints. 65-70% speed improvement. The
module is now out of beta.

Friends:

I spoken with most of you over the last few weeks regarding the new
version of AURORA due to be released tomorrow.  We've broken a lot of
new ground with this version, and  this version will serve as our
official launch into the Eastern U.S.  We've worked closely with our
Eastern customers, and responded to the needs of the market.  Some of
the enhancements:

AURORA SOFTWARE MODELING ENHANCEMENTS:
*	Energy Storage-Resources (Pumped hydro)
*	Market Areas: no limit on number of areas
*	Transmission: congestion pricing.
*	Price Caps
*	Risk Analysis
*	Modeling Enhancements via VB Scripting: "Update Data" capability

GENERAL CAPABILITIES
*	AURORA's run time speed improved again.
*	File transfers to EPIS
*	Interface Enhancements

REPORTING ENHANCEMENTS
*	Marginal Resource reporting
*	Resource operations reporting
*	Resource stacks detail consolidated

AURORA DATABASES
*	East-Central AURORA Database -- 25 market areas modeled with 11
market areas in New York ISO.
*	WSCC AURORA Database -- updated IPP resources
*	ERCOT AURORA Database - updated resources
*	All databases updated to use the new modeling capabilities


As AURORA continues to grow, and we meet the needs of the market, we
have made several procedural changes.  We continue to offer free 7-day
demos to those companies that want to take a look at the model, and get
a brief idea of how it thinks and feels.  After that 7-day demo period
we now offer either a discount for moving into a full license, or we
offer a 60-day trial for $10,000.00  --We also now offer more options
for the licensing of the model.  Annual Licenses are priced as follows:

Single User	(1 User / 1 PC)
$33,000.00
Limited-Use	(1 User / Multiple PCs  OR  Multiple Users / 1 PC)
$45,000.00
Two-User	(2 Users / 2 PCs)
$55,000.00
Site License	(Unlimited Users/PCs excluding Affiliates)
$79,000.00
Affiliate-Site	(Unlimited Users/PCs including Affiliates)
$99,000.00



For additional information, please contact me, and I'll speak with you
about how AURORA can help you in your specific operations and projects.

Vince,

I understand that you or someone in your group had a demo from the above 
group last Friday.  I was wondering if this was part of a push to bring more 
options' analytics to the traders' desks, and if so, if you could explain 
what that effort looks like?  One of the Global Markets traders, Mario de la 
Ossa also had a look at the software as he has used it in the past.

Thanks,

Kevin

Elena,

The new research web page looks very nice.   

Recently I have a few users who called me about the links to exotica options 
library.
I checked, both links to Exotica.doc and example spreadsheets do not work.

I appreciate that if you could re-establish the links as soon as possible.

Thanks.

Samer's suggestion makes a lot of sense. We can start with something like one 
floating dev. license + 2 OPL licenses and buy more later based on actual 
usage. On the pricing agreement, it probably makes sense to get a guarantee 
on the discounts  for additional licenses for one year (or till Dec.). I am 
definitely interested and can provide the share of funding necessary from my 
clients. 

Thanks,
Krishna.

Subject: RE: CPLEX floating license  

Chonawee and I just had a phone conversation with Cplex. There are other 
alternatives (products) that may help in saving time and cost. Chonawee and I 
feel that one floating develoment license, and one or two OPL (a package on 
sale that provides modeling and optimization features) licenses will do. In 
addition, we need floating deployment licenses. For the development licenses, 
the charges should be split "equally" between the different groups that may 
ask for optimization help (although it is hard to predict who may ask for 
future help). We are suggesting equally since these licenses are used to 
develop the needed solution but are not (in general) used to run the 
software. The deployment licenses can be charged on per-use basis for 
different groups.
Cplex is going to send us a new quote. We'll make the decision soon after 
that.

Hi Mark:

Please order an 800 MHZ machine with 512 MB of RAM, and a large (17"+) 
flat-screen monitor for Clayton Vernon.  Our Co. # is 0011 and our RC# is
100038.  (is the large screen a 17" or a 20"?)

If you need anything else, please let me know.

Thanks Mark and have a great day!

Subject: Re: high-end desktop computing?  

Clayton-

Sorry it took so long to get back to you.  There are a couple of things to 
keep in mind:

 -Enron IT supports Enron equipment.
 -All equipment must be purchased through "Enron IT Purchasing"

Our current high end desktop is a 800 MHZ pentium III machine with 128M of 
RAM.  You can bump up the RAM to whatever you feel is appropriate. When the 
1GHz processors come out (in the very near future) that will become our 
standard.

What we want to avoid is getting equipment that we do not have a image for.  
The "image" is the complete package of software that we put on a machine when 
it is deployed.  If you go out and buy a machine that we do not have a image 
for, we can't support it for a multitude of reasons. 

Hopefully this answered your questions/concerns.

If not, please call me so that we can discuss this further.

Thanks

I have developed a model for Enron that requires ultra-high-end PC 
performance (it does many calculations in Excel), and my boss has authorized 
me to buy whatever PC I need. I'm looking at the Compaq 850, but Richard (our 
floor rep) says no PC's over the 600 series will be supported by IT. I need 
to resolve this issue; we are sophisticated buyers, we know the type of 
machine we want, and we have the money to pay for it.

Sincerely,

Goodmorning Liz ,

We are in need of another Stentofon for Trisha Tlapek.
She works very closely with the traders and it is important
for quick communication.

Phillip,

How can I install new programs on my laptop, without 
the administrator's privileges?

One example: when I travel I use AOL to get access to my mail
and to communicate with the office. Windows 2000 does not allow 
me to install it.

 Also, I have my private statistical software
I often use when I work at night during business trips.
I would like to load it as well.

Vince

Folks,

 Those of you who have used UNIX are probably familiar with the grep command. 
It's used to extract lines from a set of files that contain a given input 
string, and is very useful. (If you have any questions on how to invoke it, 
ask me.) 

 The grep command is now available in a PC version -- see below.


Joe

Todd and Joseph,

As discussed earlier, I did recall reading somewhere that grep had been 
ported to Windows. I did some research and was able to find the Windows 
ported version of grep. Attached you will find a compressed file that 
contains the grep binary and source. Please let me know if I can be of any 
further assistance. Thanks.

Vince,

I understand that you or someone in your group had a demo from the above 
group last Friday.  I was wondering if this was part of a push to bring more 
options' analytics to the traders' desks, and if so, if you could explain 
what that effort looks like?  One of the Global Markets traders, Mario de la 
Ossa also had a look at the software as he has used it in the past.

Thanks,

Clifford:

In reviewing our February EIS Billing Summary for Co#0413, CC#107043,
I have several questions.

Telerate: (February charges: $3,032,35)
I polled the group and only one person has asked for Telerate and he is
not shown being charged for it.    That is Jason Sokolov.  He would like to
have access to Telerate.  If you could let me know how to get that for him.

The largest percent of the Telerate charges appear to be for Maureen
Raymond, who says that she does not use Telerate.  Could she be accessing
some data that she does not know is Telerate?  Please let me know.  If there
are individual accounts for Telerate the only one we need is for Jason 
Sokolov,
unless Maureen's charges are for something that she does not know is Telerate.
Tanya Tamarchenko does not need Telerate and she has the second largest
percentage of the charges.  Anyway, the only Telerate subscription we need is
for Jason Sokolov.

Reuters: (February charges:  $405.96)
No one in Research uses Reuters.  I believe most of the charges are for 
Hector 
Campos who used it when he was on the trading desk.  When he rotated into the 
Research group he did not need it any longer, but is still being billed for 
it.  Please 
remove from the Research Cost Center.

The following individuals are no longer with Enron or no longer with Research
and their accounts should be removed from the Research Cost Center.

Clayton Vernon  No longer with the Research Group Remove his LIM/LIM/EXCEL 
and LIM Core charges from the Research Cost Center
Brad Amoine  No longer with Enron   Remove his LIM/LIM/EXCEL and LIM Core 
charges from the Research Cost Center
Shalesh Ganjoo No longer with the Research Group Remove his LIM and LIM Core 
charges from the Research Cost Center

I hope this is not too confusing!
 
Please advise.

Thanks!

Shirley Crenshaw

Tanya,

Although I'm quite comfortable with providing support for running the model, 
and assisting in providing the tools to enable easier analysis of the 
results, I'm not entirely comfortable with supporting a Java debug 
environment within your team (including ad-hoc training), when we have 
facilities within the IT development team to do it here.

I'd like to meet with you to discuss this, as this seems to be an ongoing 
issue, and would like to understand the ground rules by which your team 
operates in conjunction with IT in general.

regards

Steve

Steve,
in order to be able to test the New Credit Model as well as to answer Credit 
Group's 
questions regarding the outputs from this model Research needs to be able to 
do the following:

1. Run Credit Model independently of the other runs. It is quite OK for now 
to be able to run it just for small artificial portfolios.
2. Debug the code to see what actual values are used during the run time.

Please, let me know if your team can help us.

Tanya.

Moyez,

We are very anxious to get set up and start using Livelink for tracking and 
documenting our projects, so thanks for the reminder.   I have put together 
an initial list of attributes for our Research projects.   The list in in the 
attached spreadsheet.   It would be great if you can set up these attributes 
for us in the test environment.   This would allow us to make any obvious 
changes before moving to production.   Let me know what your schedule would 
be in rolling this out.

My brief comments in the spreadsheet may not be clear, so feel free to give 
me a call at x34748 to clarify anything.

Again, thanks for your help.

Stinson

Dear Ms.Feldman,
Please find enclosed a proposal for the D-G Energy

Good morning all:

This past weekend you moved two computers from EB1972B and 1972G
and were supposed to install them in EB1941 and EB 1952.  What
happened?  There is no computer in EB 1941 and only the monitor in
EB 1952.  We need this equipment back.  Please install as soon as
possible.

Thanks and have a great day!

Chonawee and I just had a phone conversation with Cplex. There are other 
alternatives (products) that may help in saving time and cost. Chonawee and I 
feel that one floating develoment license, and one or two OPL (a package on 
sale that provides modeling and optimization features) licenses will do. In 
addition, we need floating deployment licenses. For the development licenses, 
the charges should be split "equally" between the different groups that may 
ask for optimization help (although it is hard to predict who may ask for 
future help). We are suggesting equally since these licenses are used to 
develop the needed solution but are not (in general) used to run the 
software. The deployment licenses can be charged on per-use basis for 
different groups.
Cplex is going to send us a new quote. We'll make the decision soon after 
that.

Kevin,

Please let me know when your move date has been "firmed up".  Can you let me 
know the location that you want to install the new copier at {I will need to 
check for the necessary power outlet}? Listed below are some of the latest 
generation "Heavy Duty" copiers that Enron has been installing as replacement 
for older equipment such as the Xerox 5388 etc. Feel free to try them out for 
the specific task that you have on a daily basis and let me know what you 
think {We can discuss relevant speeds & associated $ costs after you have 
tested these copiers}:









FYI: There are 2 other models from Lanier: The 5355 and the 5365. Both of 
these are the "Toshiba 70 series" digital copier rebranded as "Lanier". If 
the one of the Toshiba 70 series listed above meets your criteria, the 5300 
series from Lanier is a better cost option between the two different brands.

If possible, would you be available to meet next week to discuss further? I 
would like to invite a member of the ENA Finance group to go over cost 
allocations for the new copier, regardless of which copier selected.

Thanks,                Iain....................

Hello Iain ,
Well time is drawing near for another move
for us.
The problem is we do not have a heavy duty
copier for the floor.
We do need a copier.

Please inform me as how we can work through 
this , maybe we can split the cost with others on the floor.

The move is schedule sometime at the end of the month.

I will keep you informed........

                                                           Thanks

Shirley -

I spoke with Janelle Duree  (Manager - Move Team), she is investigating the 
mystery of the missing phone and will call me back with status - If you can 
take care of the PC, I think we look good on the phone. I also spoke with 
Paul Racicot to make sure we are all of the same mind and he is set as well.

Hi Emmanuel:

We need a computer installed on the 44th floor tomorrow, if at all possible.

We have a new summer intern coming on Monday the 19th and the
computer and everything else has disappeared from his desk.

The location is EB4444B.

The computer we are moving is Clayton Vernon's old computer.  He is
finishing up moving his files to his new computer as I am writing this.

Please call me in the morning and we will talk further.

Thanks!

Chris,

FEA just released a new version of @Energy 2.1.  Could you update it with the new version ?
Hopefully it will not take you too much time.  

As always, I value your work and appreciate your help.

Dear Vince Kaminski,

This is to inform you of the release of @Energy2.1. FTP download
instructions are available immediately. The download instructions are
included at the end of this email.    Please see below for more information
regarding this new release..

FEA is pleased to enclose your new version of @ENERGY/ErgLib. The
accompanying documentation contains installation and other information.

Here is an overview of the new and changed features since Version 2.0.

@ENERGY (Forward Curve) No change.

@ENERGY (Basics) A control variate methodology Hull (1997) has been
implemented for valuation of American options (OPT), Black and
Mean-reverting models. It greatly improves accuracy at minimal cost in
speed. All models now supports new scalar risk measures corresponding to
parallel displacement delta, hedge, and gamma.  Average price/strike options
now support an alternative way of computing theta. The definition of Gamma
curves has been modified for all models.

@ENERGY (Advanced) A faster and more accurate methodology is used to value
spread options. Models affected are SPREADOPT, STRIPSPREADOPT, OPTSPREADOPT,
OPTSTRIPSPREADOPT. The new methodology dramatically improves speed. All
models now supports new scalar risk measures corresponding to parallel
displacement delta, hedge, and gamma.  Average price/strike options now
support an alternative way of computing theta. The definition of Gamma
curves has been modified for all models.

@ENERGY (Swing) The definition of Gamma curves has been modified for all
models.

@ENERGY (Weather) No change.

See the file fea\energy\ergnote.txt in your distribution for a list of bug
fixes.

Here is an overview of the new and changed features since Version 1.6.

@ENERGY (Forward Curve)
Jump parameters are now calibrated for use in other @ENERGY functions.
Inputs and outputs to POWERCALIB and COMCALIB have changed. See the
corresponding function syntax in the User Guide for additional information.
35-40% speed improvement. The module is now out of beta.

@ENERGY (Basics)
Different interpolation schemes on forward prices are now supported. If you
use INDEXSWAP , EXOTICSWAP, or OPTINDEXSWAP with floating price linked to a
series of futures dates, such futures dates need not be close to dates
specified in the forward curve input.  A new utility function, PATHUTIL,
allows you  to simulate and visualize price paths consistent with the models
supported by @ENERGY. 25-30% speed improvement.

@ENERGY (Advanced)
Different interpolation schemes on forward prices are now supported. If you
use OPTDIFFSWAP or DIFFSWAP  with floating price linked to a series of
futures dates, such futures dates need not be close to dates specified in
the forward curve input. CALSPREADOPT now allows for the specification of
two different mean reversion rates. 30-35% speed improvement.

@ENERGY (Swing)
SWINGOPT and STRIPSWINGOPT now allow for valuation of swing straddle
contracts with overall load constraints. 65-70% speed improvement. The
module is now out of beta.

@ENERGY (Weather)
30-35% speed improvement.

See the file fea\energy\ergnote.txt in your distribution for a list of bug
fixes.
If you are a user of the ErgLib library, please be aware of possible
backward compatibility issues in calls to Eapo, Easo, Espreadapo,
Espreadaso, and Ecrackapo.  See fea\energy\ergnote.txt for additional
details.

Here is an overview of the new and changed features since Version 1.5.

@ENERGY (Basics)
European options  and strips of European options now support valuation via a
jump diffusion model (see OPT and STRIPOPT functions). Average price options
(see the APO, SPREADAPO, CRACKAPO functions), and average strike options
(see the ASO, SPREADASO functions) now allow for a direct input of the
fixing dates.

@ENERGY (Advanced)
 Includes two new functions, OPTSTRIPOPT and OPTSTRIPSPREADOPT for valuation
of complex compound options.

If you are a user of the ErgLib library, please be aware of backward
compatibility issues in calls to Eapo, Easo, Espreadapo, Espreadaso, and
Ecrackapo.  See fea\energy\ergnote.txt for additional details.

Here is an overview of the new and changed features since Version 1.4.

@ENERGY (Forward Curve)
	@ENERGY (Forward Curve) is the new module which includes functions designed
to generate forward curves, volatility curves and mean reversion rates used
in many other @ENERGY functions. Module in beta release.

@ENERGY (Basics)
	APO's and ASO's: bug fixed when avg_starts < opt_expiry, and num_fixings=1.

@ENERGY (Advanced)
	No change.

@ENERGY (Weather)
	Additional ways of formatting the temperature data are now provided.

@ENERGY (Swing)
	Pay_at_end with strips: previously implemented was pay at end of  all
periods. Now implemented is pay at end of each subperiod. . Module still in
beta release.

	Bug fixes:
1)	if max_const=min_const and max_const in not a multiple of the maximum
daily amount (in previous version min_const was disregarded in this case).
2)	in strip with global constraints: if allowed number of swings per period
changes (currently this can only be due to calendar effects).
3)	strip at index: index was incorrectly evaluated after first sub_period.

New Excel Templates
	The following Excel workbooks and worksheets have been added:

powercalib.xls	examples of generating @ENERGY parameters for power.

Add-in Manager
Now supports function help. If template is open with the Add-in manager and
function help is requested through the manager, the relevant portion of the
documentation get displayed.

Your input into the refinement of this product is welcome and greatly
appreciated. Any comments or suggestions may be sent to support@fea.com

Vince and Stinson,

I did some reserach on the option visualization.  Here is one of the findin=
gs.

Check this web site, the image looks impressive: =20
http://home.online.no/~espehaug/VirtualWorld/VirtualOptionWorld.html
This is done through a free software LiveGraphics3D and Mathematica.=20

Take a look of the demo on the web site mentioned above to see if it is goo=
d=20
enough for our purpose.

What Is LiveGraphics3D?=20

     LiveGraphics3D is a non-commercial Java 1.1 applet to display and
     rotate three-dimensional graphics produced by Mathematica in
     HTML pages. It may be used without charge for any
     non-commercial purposes. Mathematica is a program for symbolic
     and numeric mathematics by Wolfram Research, Inc.. Wolfram
     Research is also responsible for licensing LiveGraphics3D for
     commercial purposes.=20

     LiveGraphics3D enables all Mathematica users to put almost any
     three-dimensional graphics computed by Mathematica directly onto
     a HTML page, such that everyone with a web browser supporting
     Java 1.1 (e.g. Communicator 4.0 or Internet Explorer 4.0 or higher)
     can view and interactively rotate the graphics without any additional
     software.=20

     Additionally LiveGraphics3D is able to show animations, calculate
     stereo graphics, integrate hyperlinks, and display bitmap
     backgrounds. =0F%=20

Kevin,

Per your request, please see below:

******************************************************************************
***************************************
New Facsimile Machine Information

Please take a look @ the following and let me know, which FAX machine you 
choose or if you need information on something smaller, then I will have the 
Vendor contact you directly to finalise installation.  An Enron Director or 
above {With Signature Authority to legally bind Enron to a contract} will 
have to sign off on the contract paperwork before the fax machine can be 
installed. Delivery times on new machines are normally 3-5 working days but 
either Vendor listed below will be able to provide a "Loaner" should you have 
a business need. Please discuss the Fax Machine Install Date with the Rep 
when ordering the equipment.

If there is no existing fax line present, you will need to send a Notes-Mail 
to the Move Team {Erica @ x3-3185 or Janelle @ x5-7917} requesting the 
installation of a new fax line. The Move Team can be found in the Notes-Mail 
"ECT Address Book".

If you are an EES employee, you must first get new equipment approval from 
EES Budget Control. Contact Susan McLeroy @ x5-8066 or via Notes-Mail.

If you are an EBS employee, you must first get new equipment approval from 
EBS Purchasing & Budget Control. Contact Paula Corey @ x3-9948 or Martha 
Reyna @ x3-3491. You can reach both of these people via Notes-Mail.

If you are an ENA employee, you must first get new equipment approval from 
ENA Finance & Budget Control. Contact Lorie Belsha @ x3-9617 or via 
Notes-Mail.


A note on the fax machines listed below:
All the machines listed below come with a 2nd paper tray and Upgraded memory 
{Maxed by model~See Below} as an Enron Standard from each Vendor.
All the fax machines listed below have a modem speed rated @ 33.6 Kbps versus 
the Canon LaserClass 7500 {Example only} @ 14.4 Kbps = New fax machine should 
be noticeably quicker.
Document feeder capacity of the machines listed below are the same as the 
Canon LaserClass 7500             {Example only}
Maintenance = Models listed below have Maintenance/Repair coverage included 
in monthly $ total. There is NO separate agreement! Toner/Drum cartridges + 
paper + line charges are extra {Not quoted}

Contract pricing can change without warning, so please let me know ASAP if a 
Vendor quotes you a different price to those listed below against the various 
models.

If the fax machine is to be used in a trading type environment, here are some 
considerations:
No more than 20 people per fax machine = Take a look @ the fax machine 
placement on EB30 or EB31.
Disregard any fax machine that does not have a 33.6K Modem and JBIG 
compression {or equivalent}.
Look for memory upgrades & 2nd paper tray included in monthly cost. {Models 
quoted are loaded}.
Maintenance is to be INCLUDED in Monthly Cost {Models quoted are covered}.

*********************

The above machines are designed for workgroup use.
Q) How many people will be using this fax machine?
Q) How much usage will this fax machine have? 
{i.e. Heavy = 40 faxes per day @ 20 pages/60 faxes per day @ 2-3 pages or a 
lot less? If "HEAVY", either the PB2050, PB9930 or  UF885/UF895 should fit 
your needs = If 15-40, the PB9830 would probably be a better fit}

*********************
CONTRACT DETAILS     
The Fax programs are an agreement between each end user of the fax machine 
and the relevant Vendor, as follows:

Pitney Bowes
36 month RENTAL.
30 day notice for termination of contract.
No Penalty for early Termination of contract = Call PB Rep. and have the 
machine picked up, making sure a receipt is given to you by the collecting 
Rep.
Upgrade/Downgrade available = $0 penalty.
Rep will be happy to discuss details with you and answer any questions on 
these points.


Panasonic Communications

*********************
Please note the following

The Facsimile Machine Agreement is between the Enron Business Unit/Department 
requesting the Facsimile Machine and the Vendor.

The User or Requester of the Fax machine is responsible for invoice payment.

Enron Property & Services Corporation is NOT responsible for the coding, 
processing or payment of Facsimile {FAX} machine invoices.

In order to return any old fax machine equipment, you must contact the 
leasing company that supplied the equipment and send them a certified letter 
that terminates the agreement. If you terminate a contract within the 
original agreement period, you may be liable for penalty charges as a lot of 
Fax Machines are on a non-cancellable lease agreement. The Vendor who 
supplied the fax equipment will be able to let you know of any outstanding $ 
amounts for your existing equipment. 

If you are asked to pay outstanding $ amounts, be aware that some Vendors 
include the cost of outright PURCHASE of the old fax equipment = From the 
contracts I have reviewed so far, you are under NO obligation to purchase the 
old equipment.

IKON CONTACT NAME FOR RETURNS:
Beth Frank: Phone = New # --> 409-441-1262 {Previously 281-355-6274}

*** Please call me or e-mail me if it is a different Vendor name on the 
machine and I will respond with a contact name ***

Charges for fax machines are dependant upon manufacturer & model, with the 
person responsible for the fax machine, paying the invoice. You MUST notify 
the Vendor of any changes relating to Fax Machine assignment {even if it is 
within the same group} = Who the machine has been reassigned to {Contact 
name}, the new contact phone # AND the location of the machine.

Vince,

I understand that you or someone in your group had a demo from the above 
group last Friday.  I was wondering if this was part of a push to bring more 
options' analytics to the traders' desks, and if so, if you could explain 
what that effort looks like?  One of the Global Markets traders, Mario de la 
Ossa also had a look at the software as he has used it in the past.

Thanks,

Kevin

WeatherDelta tool-kit.?  It is the only application that we know of, that 
can?model temperature,  loads, and power prices in several locations 
simultaneously: thus allowing the  user to measure the value an risk in a 
variety of financial instruments,  physical obligations and assets.? I have 
attached the product overview  sheet, and would be happy to discuss its

Current Notes User:

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook client will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook client is configured on your desktop.

2. Remote access to your mailbox.
After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) for remote access to your mailbox.

PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while connecting to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA available from your home or when traveling abroad.

HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe

Substitute "john.doe" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in "corp/your user id" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You will now be able to view your mailbox.

	

PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the functions NOT available via OWA:

Features NOT available using OWA:

-  Tasks
-  Journal
-  Spell Checker
-  Offline Use
-  Printing Templates
-  Reminders
-  Timed Delivery
-  Expiration
-  Outlook Rules
-  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall
-  Sharing Contacts with others
-  Task Delegation
-  Direct Resource Booking
-  Personal Distribution Lists

QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?

If you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the Outlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at:

	Outlook.2000@enron.com

Otherwise, you may contact the Resolution Center at:

	713-853-1411

Vincent,
 
It was good speaking with you this afternoon. 
 
NumeriX provides versatile solutions for the pricing and risk management of complex derivative instruments. Of particular interest to Enron may be the use of NumeriX Tools for supporting energy derivatives. 
 
The energy solution provided is a versatile Excel/C/C++ environment for structuring and pricing complex derivatives in the electricity marketplace. The model is based on a microeconomic determination of one or multiple electricity forward curves. Power demands by utility companies are balanced with power generating plants' production to determine the marginal price of electricity for multiple geographic regions. Inter-regional transmission constraints are imposed to calculate monthly forward prices for border stations. 
 
The energy solution is based on Monte Carlo simulation. The regional power demands and fossil fuel prices are modeled as random processes where model parameters are determined from historical data. Marginal prices from different regions are used to determine border prices. This procedure is iterated over many scenarios and subsequent averages are taken to determine the forward COB prices.
 
I. Overview
NumeriX is a leading provider of modular analytical toolkits and off-the-shelf applications that are used for structuring, pricing and quantifying the risk of any type of complex financial instrument or exotic derivative. NumeriX solutions are designed for easy integration with existing in-house or third-party trading or risk management applications. NumeriX solutions include:
NumeriX Tools 
NumeriX FI 
NumeriX FX 
NumeriX EQ

Some of the key benefits of NumeriX solutions include:
Support for all asset classes 
Fixed Income Instruments 
Equity Instruments 
Foreign Exchange Instruments 
Commodity Derivatives 
Credit Derivatives 
Insurance Products
Ability to value any complex financial instrument or exotic derivative 
Increased instrument-valuation precision 
Leading-edge valuation models and calibration routines 
Enhanced risk management solutions 
Stable development platform for building pricing and riskmanagement solutions 

II. NumeriX Analytics
 
NumeriX provides comprehensive solutions that feature advanced tree, simulation (Monte Carlo), stochastic mesh and calibration methods for the following models:
One-factor models: 
Hull-White/Extended Vasicek 
Black-Karasinski 
Black-Derman-Toy 
Black-Scholes
Multi-factor models: 
Multi-factor Hull-White 
Multi-factor Black-Karasinski 
Brace-Gatarek-Musiela/Jamshidian

NumeriX provides a Monte Carlo methodology that employs leading-edge technology with the following features/benefits:
Increased accuracy and faster convergence 
Better sampling of tail events 
Adaptive number generation 
Points do not cluster or leave voids 
Support for correlated sequences 
Generates normal and lognormal sequential processes or concurrent distributions with optional continuous or discrete bounds 
Supports public domain and NumeriX developed sequence generators

III. NumeriX Tools
 
NumeriX Tools is a suite of innovative development tools that provide speed, flexibility and ease of use for all aspects of derivatives pricing and risk management, including building new instruments and new models. A collection of object-oriented modules accessed through a well-designed interface available in C or C++, it includes core mathematical and computational functions required for complex derivatives pricing and risk management.  NumeriX Tools supports all financial asset classes and is designed to maximize flexibility and minimize development and computation time, each component of the NumeriX Tools integrates many cutting-edge algorithms into one intelligent, easy-to-use API. 
 
IV. NumeriX Applications
 
NumeriX FI, designed for traders and risk managers, is a comprehensive and flexible off-the-shelf application for structuring, pricing, and quantifying the risk of any type of complex fixed-income instrument, interest-rate derivative, or exotic structure. NumeriX FI offers flexible and robust instrument-definition and structuring capabilities with advanced tree, simulation (Monte Carlo), stochastic-mesh and calibration methods for both single-factor and multi-factor pricing models.
 
NumeriX FX provides valuation and risk management for a wide collection of plain and exotic foreign exchange options. NumeriX FX includes a variety of Black-Scholes pricing models with a choice of tree- or Monte Carlo-based simulation methodologies.
 
NumeriX EQ provides valuation and risk management for a wide collection of exotic equity derivatives including barriers, basket options, chooser structures and convertible bonds. Please note that NumeriX EQ is in development and scheduled for release in Q3 of 2001.
 
NumeriX CR provides valuation and risk management for a wide collection of exotic credit derivatives including credit swaps, asset swaps, total return swaps, spread options, credit-linked notes and credit basket structures. Please note that NumeriX CR is in development and scheduled for release in the later half of 2001.
 
NumeriX solutions are platform independent (Windows NT or Unix) and provided in the form of C and C++ libraries that are available either as a modular toolkit, designed to minimize the development time for structuring new products or models, or as an application solution. NumeriX application solutions are available as an Excel application or as DLLs designed for quick and easy integration with any third-party trading, risk management or straight-through processing trade support application.
 
Attached you will find some additional materials describing specific NumeriX solutions.
 
I look forward to speaking with you on Monday April 9, 2001 at 1:30 your time (2:30 PM NY time).
   
If you have any questions please feel free to give me a call at (212) 302-6225. 
 
Sincerely,
 
 
Dean Tallam

This information was also sent  to IT Purchasing.
I need to know what options we have and how soon it
can be delivered.
Don't we need to know as well? Before purchase.
I  also need a central location for this printer.

                                               Thanks
                                             Kevin Moore
Sam mentioned HP4500 , I will check into it.

Kevin:

What kind of information do you need?  I thought you were going to look
at some colored printer literature.   Sam seemed to be aware of a
colored printer that might work for us.  Ask him.  I don't think we need
anything as big as "Sapphire".

 It will be located in your area on the 19th floor.

Thanks!

Julie:

I talked to both Maureen and Tanya and neither one want this service and
have not been using it.  

Maureen told me that she told you a year ago that she did not want Telerate 
(when she was supporting Gary Hickerson's group on 30).  If that is the case, 
we probably need a refund.

Let me know if there is anything that can be done about this.

The only person in our group that wants Telerate is Jason Sokolov and I
put in a request for that yesterday.  Please cancel everything else.

Thanks!

Shirley

Hi Shirley,
 Regarding Telerate:  I can cancel the service for both Maurenn and Tanya, 
but another name commonly used for the Telerate application is Bridge or 
Bridgestation so you may want to just ask the two of them once more to be 
sure that they do not use it.  Just let me know and I will cancel billing

Jason can get access to it by submitting an e-request for him for Telerate.  
When you go into E-request and it is prompting you for what application to 
choose, type in the words Market Data and hit Search.  Telerate will pop up 
as an option and within that choose the role Basic Energy.  We will take care 
of it from there.

I will also remove Hector Campos from Reuters.  Was there anyone else being 
charged for Reuters services that are not needed?

I will also remove Clayton Vernon.  I do not see anything under the name Brad 
Amoine, is this the correct spelling of his name?  I will also find
out where Shalesh's charges should be moved to.

Thanks for updating us and let me know if there is anything else.

Julie

Hi Shirley.  I've copied this to Julie Pechersky, who maintains the Market 
Data database, and will be able to make the user changes you request.  She'll 
also be able to tell you how / when Telerate can be enabled for Mr. Sokolov.

We get the billing data from her, so once it is correct there, it will be 
billed correctly.

Subject: Various Market Data Charges to the Research Group for February 2001

Clifford:

In reviewing our February EIS Billing Summary for Co#0413, CC#107043,
I have several questions.

Telerate: (February charges: $3,032,35)
I polled the group and only one person has asked for Telerate and he is
not shown being charged for it.    That is Jason Sokolov.  He would like to
have access to Telerate.  If you could let me know how to get that for him.

The largest percent of the Telerate charges appear to be for Maureen
Raymond, who says that she does not use Telerate.  Could she be accessing
some data that she does not know is Telerate?  Please let me know.  If there
are individual accounts for Telerate the only one we need is for Jason 
Sokolov,
unless Maureen's charges are for something that she does not know is Telerate.
Tanya Tamarchenko does not need Telerate and she has the second largest
percentage of the charges.  Anyway, the only Telerate subscription we need is
for Jason Sokolov.

Reuters: (February charges:  $405.96)
No one in Research uses Reuters.  I believe most of the charges are for 
Hector 
Campos who used it when he was on the trading desk.  When he rotated into the 
Research group he did not need it any longer, but is still being billed for 
it.  Please 
remove from the Research Cost Center.

The following individuals are no longer with Enron or no longer with Research
and their accounts should be removed from the Research Cost Center.

Clayton Vernon  No longer with the Research Group Remove his LIM/LIM/EXCEL 
and LIM Core charges from the Research Cost Center
Brad Amoine  No longer with Enron   Remove his LIM/LIM/EXCEL and LIM Core 
charges from the Research Cost Center
Shalesh Ganjoo No longer with the Research Group Remove his LIM and LIM Core 
charges from the Research Cost Center

I hope this is not too confusing!
 
Please advise.

Thanks!

Shirley Crenshaw

Hi Sandy:

Yes he does.  Actually in our group meeting today, Vince Kaminski said
that he wants most of his group to have access.  I believe Stinson Gibner
is working on the list.  Is there a way we could submit a request to 
incorporate 
a list of people to give them access?  They would need writing access also.

Thanks!

Shirley

Shirley,

The default access is Read Only.  Does this person need more rights, i.e. 
Editor?

Current Notes User:

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook 
client will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail 
via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is 
configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is 
migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your 
web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and 
To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook 
client is configured on your desktop.

2. Remote access to your mailbox.
After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) 
for remote access to your mailbox.

PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while 
connecting to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA 
available from your home or when traveling abroad.

HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  
http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe

Substitute "john.doe" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You 
will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in "corp/your user 
id" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You 
will now be able to view your mailbox.

 

PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between 
the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things 
in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the 
functions NOT available via OWA:

Features NOT available using OWA:

-  Tasks
-  Journal
-  Spell Checker
-  Offline Use
-  Printing Templates
-  Reminders
-  Timed Delivery
-  Expiration
-  Outlook Rules
-  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall
-  Sharing Contacts with others
-  Task Delegation
-  Direct Resource Booking
-  Personal Distribution Lists

QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?

If you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the 
Outlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at:

 Outlook.2000@enron.com

Otherwise, you may contact the Resolution Center at:

 713-853-1411

John/Vince:

I really enjoyed the meeting the other day with you and a broad cross
section of your people.  Thank you very much for setting it up, and thank
you for giving me the opportunity to speak with your people.

As I mentioned to John, I am sending you the license paperwork for
MarketPoint.  I have attached our standard license agreement for your
consideration.  As I mentioned, the license agreement covers the entire
bundled product, which includes

? North American gas, short and long term
? North American electricity, short and long term
? World gas
? Western European gas
? World oil

We are just finishing porting the world oil, world gas, and western Europea=
n
gas models over from our old (now obsolete) software system into
MarketPoint, so they will not be fully tested and complete for a couple of
months.  However, the gas and electricity models for North America are
presently complete and tested.  That should allow us to give you an
attractive price before the full worldwide toolkit is available throughout
your worldwide business.

As I understood it, you will want the gas modeling capability first and wil=
l
want to defer decisions on electric or other capability.  As I mentioned at
the meeting, we are prepared to offer that for approximately=20
 the fully
bundled price.  As you read the license agreement, you will see that the
software licenses for $100,000 annually, the gas data for $5,000, and the
electric data for $10,000.  MarketPoint will agree to license you the gas
model plus the data for=20
 the software license plus the data license for a
total of $55,000 annually.  This is just under=20
 the fully bundled price.  I
think that is consistent with the discussions at our meeting, and from
MarketPoint=01,s perspective would provide a great basis to move forward
together with Enron.  If or when Enron ever desires to =01&scale up=018 to =
another
model or model(s) from the MarketPoint portfolio, we will simply scale you
up to the entire license agreement.  This will allow you to decouple the ga=
s
decision from any other decisions you might make.  (I will be glad to put
this additional pricing provision into the agreement if you decide to move
forward.)

I felt I was able to communicate the philosophy, scope, and operation of ou=
r
approach during the meeting and to deliver you much of the information you
might need to evaluate whether MarketPoint meets your needs.  I thought you
were able to see the depth and sophistication of the product yet at the sam=
e
time its simplicity and effectiveness.  I thought you were able to see the
benefits of the MarketPoint dimension of economic equilibrium as a
complement and supplement to other approaches you will assuredly use.  I
would be interested in your impressions and those of your colleagues.  I
look forward to your response and to moving ahead together.  We view you as
a very important prospective customer and client and will work with you to
earn and secure your business.

If you decide to license MarketPoint, we can arrange to transfer and mount
MarketPoint and the short term NARG model (which is the model we suggest yo=
u
begin with) and travel to Houston to deliver our 1=20
 day training seminar.
Our clients are usually very fluent after that 1=20
 day training seminar.
Thereafter, we would want you to work with the short term NARG model for a
few weeks while you get up to speed, very fluent, and very comfortable
before you take delivery of the longer term version of NARG several weeks
later.

Thanks again, and all the best.  If there is some item from the meeting tha=
t
I might have forgotten to send, please remind me.  My notes don't show
anything, but I was speaking a lot rather than writing notes during the
meeting and might have overlooked something someone wanted.

here alst. I'll let you kow what time(s) he'll be available next Tuesday. 
Sorry for the delay

Ian -- please ensure that Vince Kaminski is set up to use the media server

Vincent,

I enjoyed meeting with you yesterday and discussing our Gas & Power
Marketing & Trading Study.  We really hope that Enron is able to participate
this year and we will work with you to address your concerns.  I believe
that the problem last year was primarily due to concerns over releasing data
in general and not our study in particular.

I am attaching an electronic copy of the latest version of the input sheet
for the study.  It is far easier to read on a computer than in print.
Please remember that Enron does not need to answer every question to
participate and that all results are reported back in a blinded format.  The
only data points identified by company are the data points for the company
values of the company receiving the report.

If you have any further questions regarding the report, please do not
hesitate to call John Stephenson or myself at (713) 523-8001.   Have a great
weekend and thank you for your efforts to enable Enron to participate in
this year's study.


Sincerely,

Richard Murphy

Vince,

Here is my edited version of the software license agreement.    Can you read 
it once before I forward it for internal approval?   I specified that the 
$100,000 covers a single  user  perpetural license,  access to source after 
one year,  and covers maintenance and support for one year.

Any suggestions?

Deal all,

I have written the option pricing formula for European (EURO), American 
(Amer) and Asian (AGC) options.
I have also cited the references for each option.  The function names in ( ) 
are the option models in the 
Enron Exotica options library.   You do not have to have outside programmer 
to duplicate our work, since we have
constructed and tested these models.

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Subject: EOL Phase 2  

Thanks for your help on content for EOL phase 2.

An additional piece of content that we are trying to include in our scope is 
an options calculator.  This would be an interactive tool to teach less 
sophisticated counterparties about options.  We would like to collaborate 
with someone in research to refine our approach (and make sure we're using 
the right formulas).  Who should we contact in research for this?

Attached is a mock-up of what we have in mind...

Inputs and outputs to POWERCALIB and COMCALIB have changed. See the
corresponding function syntax in the User Guide for additional information.
35-40% speed improvement. The module is now out of beta.

@ENERGY (Basics)
Different interpolation schemes on forward prices are now supported. If you
use INDEXSWAP , EXOTICSWAP, or OPTINDEXSWAP with floating price linked to a
series of futures dates, such futures dates need not be close to dates
specified in the forward curve input.  A new utility function, PATHUTIL,
allows you  to simulate and visualize price paths consistent with the models
supported by @ENERGY. 25-30% speed improvement.

@ENERGY (Advanced)
Different interpolation schemes on forward prices are now supported. If you
use OPTDIFFSWAP or DIFFSWAP  with floating price linked to a series of
futures dates, such futures dates need not be close to dates specified in
the forward curve input. CALSPREADOPT now allows for the specification of
two different mean reversion rates. 30-35% speed improvement.

@ENERGY (Swing)
SWINGOPT and STRIPSWINGOPT now allow for valuation of swing straddle
contracts with overall load constraints. 65-70% speed improvement. The
module is now out of beta.

@ENERGY (Weather)
30-35% speed improvement.


If you have any questions please feel free to contact us. We appreciate this
opportunity to be of continuing service to Enron North America Corp..

Enron has been given a two week free trail [until 4/25/00] for FT Online.   
The free trial has unlimited users so please feel free to pass this along to 
anyone who may be interested.

Various persons within Enron currently purchase selected hard copies of FT's 
newsletters for 18,331 British pounds.  It would be much more efficient  and 
cheaper if all eleven newsletters [13,617 British pounds for 2 users plus 
incremental costs for each additional user] were purchased on-line and the 
cost shared amoung the users.

Vincent,

?

It was good speaking with you this afternoon. 

?

NumeriX provides versatile solutions for the pricing and risk management of 
complex derivative instruments. Of particular interest to Enron may be the 
use of NumeriX Tools for supporting energy derivatives. 

?

The energy solution provided is a versatile Excel/C/C++ environment for 
structuring and pricing complex derivatives in the electricity marketplace. 
The model is based on a microeconomic determination of one or multiple 
electricity forward curves. Power demands by utility companies are balanced 
with power generating plants'?production to determine the marginal price of 
electricity for multiple geographic regions. Inter-regional transmission 
constraints are imposed to calculate monthly forward prices for border 
stations. 

?

The?energy solution is based on Monte Carlo simulation. The regional power 
demands and fossil fuel prices are modeled as random processes where model 
parameters are determined from historical data. Marginal prices from 
different regions are used to determine border prices. This procedure is 
iterated over many scenarios and subsequent averages are taken to determine 
the forward COB prices.

?

I. Overview

NumeriX is a leading provider of?modular analytical toolkits and 
off-the-shelf applications that are used for structuring,?pricing 
and?quantifying the risk?of any?type of complex?financial instrument?or

Timothy:

I still have a problem.   When I am on the ECI network I cannot receive 
email, and, even worse,  I cannot even send email.     This is not an 
acceptable situation.   I need to have a fully functional email account on 
the ECI side as well as the ENA side.    Don't tell me that its against 
policy because I know that Ravi Thuraisingham has already be set up this way 
for months.    I don't care if mail from one network is forwarded to the 
other as I will have access in Houston to both, but I can already see that I 
need to have functional accounts on both sides, or it will be a continual 
thorn in my side when travelling to Portland, etc...

Again thanks for your help on getting this set up correctly,

I  must have written down your phone number incorrectly,  it did not work.

Regarding my user ID on the ECI network,  I would be set up in the same way 
as Ravi Thuraisingham with an ID on both the ENA and the ECI networks.   I am 
in the Corp. research group but am spending about 80% of my time in support

Vince,

I am trying to price a crack spread option utilizing either of the following 
models in the Exotica Library:

1. Spread Options by 1-D integration - SPRDOPT

2. Spread Options on Asian Spreads - ASNSPRD

How do I get access to these options models?  Who can I visit with in the 
Houston group if I have any questions regarding the models.  Your help would 
be greatly appreciated.  I am located in Singapore, so I would probably be 
visiting with the Houston personnel via e-mail.

Thanks,

Pat Markey

P.S. - I have access to the O:\research\exotica\xll\xll_templates\ directory; 
however, there are no macros associated with the programs that I can find.  
Also, I don't have access to the M: drive.  Please let me know where to find 
these options models.

Laine,

I can initial it. Please, contact Beth Perlman as an IT officer.
I shall explain the reason we are buying the software to her.

I want the software to reside in our London office - the software is used
primarily by European utilities and we shall use it as a pricing tool
in negotiations with European clients.

There are many different variations of the "ILOVEYOU" computer virus still 
being reported.  The IT Infrastructure team is continually updating our virus 
software as new versions become available, but it is extremely important that 
you do not open any attachments that you do not regularly receive from 
business associates.  Even business associates you are very familiar with 
could be sending you the virus without knowing it, so unless you are 
expecting an email from them with an specified attachment please do not open 
it.  If you are unsure whether to open an attachment please do not open it.  
Call your HelpDesk to ask any questions and to get verification if required.

We may need you to log out and log back in during the day as new anti virus 
updates become available.  We appreciate your cooperation while we all work 
to keep Enron's computing environment secure.

Please note the following Enron Policies regarding viruses: 

Email

Malicious Code (Virus) Screening
In addition to the Enron requirement for email attachments (received and 
sent) to be screened for malicious code (viruses, Trojan Horses, etc.), users 
of Enron information resources are required to detach email attachments that 
are received on to their hard drive for local virus screening purposes. 

All executables (*.bat, *exe, *.com, *.vbs) files should never be launched 
from email without first consulting with IT. 

Virus Alerts
The Internet is constantly being flooded with information about computer 
viruses and Trojan Horses. However, within among real virus notices are 
computer virus hoaxes. While these hoaxes do not infect systems, they are 
still time consuming and costly to handle. It only wastes bandwidth and 
unnecessarily alarms other computer users.

Please, do not perpetuate unconfirmed warnings about viruses and Trojan 
Horses. If you receive an invalidated warning, don't pass it to all your 
friends, pass it to your IT computer security manager to validate first.

Jim,

CHARM looks more like  a prototype that requires a lot of work to make it more a
production tool.

We have developed a similar model (without some nice functionalities CHARM has)
in about two weeks, at request of Rick Jones who joined EES from HSB. Rick
worked on a similar model at his old company  and wanted to have a similar tool
for his projects with Enron. I can tell you more about it when we meet (hopefully) later
this week. 

I would tell Willis that the model requires more work before Enron can
consider it as commercial product.

Vince

Subject: Dale Nesbitt meeting

Margaret Carson is going to join us in the meeting next week with Nesbitt.  
Vince will check with ENA to see if they also want to attend.  I would also 
like to determine if ETS and/or NBP would want to send a representative(s), 
although Margaret said she would take copious notes for distribution to other 
key players as necessary.  We should ask Nesbitt how he would structure a 
deal for multiple clients (eg. ETS, NBP, ENA, and maybe El Paso).  

[We need to remain aware of any "affiliate" issues that may result, and make 
certain that we are in complete compliance with the regs.]

I will wait until after our meeting with Nesbitt before deciding if/how to 
approach El Paso.  Presumably, if asked to particpate, they would share the 
cost and have independent access to any working model that is developed.

John,

I talked to Dale Nesbitt. He suggested that the best way to evaluate his 
model is to
go through a one week intensive project with assistance of somebody from his 
company.
Our cost  is a flat fee of $12,500 that would be deducted from the purchase 
price of $55,000,
in case we buy the software package.

The price of 55K is indicative and will be adjusted based on the required 
level of support.

Dale will be in Houston next week. I have tentatively invited him to visit 
with us on Tuesday,
November 7, at 3:00 p.m. He will adjust if you are busy at this time.


Please, let me know what you think.

Vince

The system will not allow me to view this request, saying that it has been

Debbie,

This is an update on the continuing Winston saga. Tanya
identified the sections of the code that produce inefficiencies
but the rest is in the Winston's hands.

Steve Stock is very cooperative and takes a very rational, Enron-first
approach to the problem. Privately, my concern is that the code, based on 
Tanya's
report to me, leaves a lot to be desired. The code tends to be a very 
mechanical
implementation of the algorithm, developed without a series attempt to 
optimize it.

Let's keep paddling along.

Vince

Tanya,

I just checked in with the contractors here.....and it looks like it might be 
a good idea for you to spend about 30minutes with them to give you a guided 
tour of their documentation.

It's presented as a linked set of word documents and Visio drawing, with 
links to all the reletive parts as hyperlinks. It's pretty good and I imagine 
it will be very usefull to you, but probably requires a little introduction 
first.

Please feel free to come to my office whenever it is convenient. Even if I'm 
not available, the guys are just outside my office and I can easily stop 
whatever I'm doing to introduce you to the project manager.

regards

Steve

Steve,
- we spent about 5 fruitful hours with Winston last week.
- I pretty much understand the data flow when the code runs.
- I also got an idea where the time is spent during the execution of the code 
by questioning Winston.
I did not see any results of profiling the code. Winston's opinion is (as I 
understood) that he knows how much time is spent 
on different calculations and profiling is not easy to do, so we don't need 
to do it. 
- Based on above I suggested possible way to reduce the time credit model 
takes to run and we discussed it with Debbie, who was
going to arrange a meeting with Winston.
- It might be useful to look at the Documentation created by contractors, if 
you have it handy - send it to me, please.

Thank you,

Tanya.

how's it going with code-review from your perspective?

...did you manage to talk to our Documentation contractors?

...if not, would you me to arrange for them to bring you the documentation as

Clayton-

Sorry it took so long to get back to you.  There are a couple of things to 
keep in mind:

 -Enron IT supports Enron equipment.
 -All equipment must be purchased through "Enron IT Purchasing"

Our current high end desktop is a 800 MHZ pentium III machine with 128M of 
RAM.  You can bump up the RAM to whatever you feel is appropriate. When the 
1GHz processors come out (in the very near future) that will become our 
standard.

What we want to avoid is getting equipment that we do not have a image for.  
The "image" is the complete package of software that we put on a machine when 
it is deployed.  If you go out and buy a machine that we do not have a image 
for, we can't support it for a multitude of reasons. 

Hopefully this answered your questions/concerns.

If not, please call me so that we can discuss this further.

Thanks

Mark-

I have developed a model for Enron that requires ultra-high-end PC 
performance (it does many calculations in Excel), and my boss has authorized 
me to buy whatever PC I need. I'm looking at the Compaq 850, but Richard (our 
floor rep) says no PC's over the 600 series will be supported by IT. I need 
to resolve this issue; we are sophisticated buyers, we know the type of 
machine we want, and we have the money to pay for it.

Sincerely,

Mike,

We have decided to go ahead with the purchase of a single license of IMSL
libraries (C/C++) for PC.  I believe that would be CNL 4.0 forPC.  Let me
check the cost for the license before we finalize it as I have mislaid your
previous e-mail about the cost.  It is my recollection that it is less than
$1500.  Please e-mail to confirm with the precise number so we can proceed
wih that.

Thanks,

Rakesh

Rakesh,

As we discussed, the CNL 4.0 PC libraries are not license managed.  Version
5 will be.  The PC Version 4.0 can be installed on a network drive and
called from networked PCs.  As expected, we would ask that Enron honor the
license agreement by allowing only the number of simultaneous uses
permitted
by the license.  Version 5.0 will be license managed and can be licensed as
node locked or floating.

With regard to Unix licensing, the current version of CNL for Unix is
license managed.  It can be licensed as node locked or floating.  If you
install the libraries on a Unix server as node locked, the number of
simultaneous sessions on that server is not limited except by the
capabilities of the machine.  A floating Unix license would be checked out
by the individual user to be executed on a local machine.

Also as mentioned, your investment is protected by allowing you to upgrade
in the future by paying only the price difference between your current and
desired platforms.  This upgrade option only applies to licenses covered
under support.

If you have any additional questions, please let me know.  I look forward
to
providing you the best math and statistical libraries available today to
help you solve your problems and understand your data.

Vince,
I'd like to purchase some copies of the XPRESS LP solver for the gas storage 
optimization model.  We have previously discussed the purchase of CPLEX, but 
after trialing both systems, have found some worthwhile advantages with 
XPRESS.  If others find Planner / CPLEX best suited to their application, I 
see no problem is their use of a different system - both have strengths, and 
it is likely that I would use Planner/CPLEX myself on some future project if 
we were to have both systems available.

XPRESS is particularly suited to my application because it handles Special 
Ordered Sets.  This is a very efficient way of representing the storage 
ratchets as the integer search process is able to use the extra information 
provided by the set, rather than just using binary integer variables to 
represent the ratchets.

Planner is a C++ interface for CPLEX.  It has some significant limitations, 
and does not permit access to all CPLEX features.

Dash Optimization have made the following offer:
All software purchases made by Enron this year will be at 30% off the list 
price - we do not need to make a single purchase of any specific quantity of 
licenses to obtain this discount.
90 days of full maintenance services will be provided with the purchase.
The EMOSL utility will be provided at no cost.
The XBSL system will be provided at no cost when it is released in a few 
weeks time.

For the Gas Storage Optimization model, I would like to purchase:
One development license, hyper version, with modeller, primal/dual simplex, 
MIP search, dlls, EMOSL and XBSL when available.
 List price $10,000  Discounted price  $7,000
Two run time licenses for above,
 List price total $8,000    Discounted price  $5,600
     Total cost  $12,600

I've used the usually security request system to set the purchase process 
going, should you agree to this.

Tom.

Subject: Dale Nesbitt meeting

Margaret Carson is going to join us in the meeting next week with Nesbitt.  
Vince will check with ENA to see if they also want to attend.  I would also 
like to determine if ETS and/or NBP would want to send a representative(s), 
although Margaret said she would take copious notes for distribution to other 
key players as necessary.  We should ask Nesbitt how he would structure a 
deal for multiple clients (eg. ETS, NBP, ENA, and maybe El Paso).  

[We need to remain aware of any "affiliate" issues that may result, and make 
certain that we are in complete compliance with the regs.]

I will wait until after our meeting with Nesbitt before deciding if/how to 
approach El Paso.  Presumably, if asked to particpate, they would share the 
cost and have independent access to any working model that is developed.

John,

I talked to Dale Nesbitt. He suggested that the best way to evaluate his 
model is to
go through a one week intensive project with assistance of somebody from his 
company.
Our cost  is a flat fee of $12,500 that would be deducted from the purchase 
price of $55,000,
in case we buy the software package.

The price of 55K is indicative and will be adjusted based on the required 
level of support.

Dale will be in Houston next week. I have tentatively invited him to visit 
with us on Tuesday,
November 7, at 3:00 p.m. He will adjust if you are busy at this time.


Please, let me know what you think.

Vince

Stinson,

I'm not sure who was going to handle this project - Tom Moore or Laine 
Borgman.  So, by this e-mail, I will ask the appropriate person to respond to 
you.  I have also given Tom's name and e-mail address to Ms. Geman. 

They will just need to change in Article 17 of the Software License Agreement 
the response time from 2 to 3 days and the Software License part should be 
done.  The only thing that would leave then is Ms. Geman's response regarding 
the Escrow Agreement as to whether it was agreeable to her and her law firm 
(who would be holding the source code in escrow).  I'm not sure whether Ms. 
Geman has responded to Tom about that or not.  I have sent electronic copies 
of all of the documents to both Tom and Laine to finalize once Ms. Geman 
responded.

Tom can be reached at:  x55552
Laine can be reached at:  x56470


Thanks,
Karla

Sorry for the delay.    I have been out for the last three weeks.    Vince 
tells me that he has talked to Ms. Geman and they agreed on a time of 3 
business days for a response time.    

Is there someone else now handling this project?

Ms. Geman,

I apologize for the delay, but I finally have drafted an Escrow Agreement for 
placing the software in escrow with your attorneys.  Please review and have 
your attorneys review and let me know if it is acceptable.

I will be leaving the department I have been working in and moving to a 
different Enron subsidiary on October 13.  If at all possible, could we try 
to get the Software License Agreement and the Escrow Agreement wrapped up 
before I leave so that someone else does not have to try to pick up where I 
left off?

I think we are just about in agreement on the Software License portion.  
Seems like the only outstanding question had to do with your concern 
regarding providing a response time of 2 business days.  I do not have any 
answers regarding that - maybe Vince Kaminski or Stinson Gibner can respond 
on this issue.  

I look forward to hearing from you and trying to get this finalized within 
the next 2 weeks if possible.

Thank you,

Vince:

I will send you our contract for the week long engagement.  The way we do it
is send out our time and materials contract, which has a space for
individual task statements.  I then put in a task statement for the week
long project at the $12K level so that the costs and risks are capped for
you.  Look for it in the next day or two.

With regard to the long run and short run gas models, they are both
implemented in the same software system.  Neither is a prerequisite for
running the other, but both operate the same way and the sum of the two
consumes approximately the same resources are either individually.

I plan to have an extended visit in Houston beginning one week from today
and lasting through the following Wednesday.  (Intensively tutoring my
daughter for her first semester economics finals at Rice.  She certainly
should have gotten a better looking tutor.)  That will make it very easy to
come by and finalize whatever needs to be finalized with you that week.
With her in Houston, I spend a good bit of time there.

Look for the stuff in the next day or two.  I look forward to working with
you and your colleagues.

Thanks
Dale

Dale,

Thanks for your message. In our phone conversation before the meeting  you
mentioned
another contractual arrangement under which we could work with  your
company employees on a case-study.

The cost of a weekly project  would be $12,000 that would be applied to the
purchase price should
we go ahead and decide to acquire the software. This project would allow us
to evaluate the model and
come up with an estimate of the manpower necessary to support  the model
internally.

Please, let me know more about this option.

We are primarily interested in a long-term natural gas model and the
database for North America.
Unless a familiarity with the short term model is a prerequisite, we don't
have resources to spend too much time on it.

Of course, a trading desk may be interested in the short term
version of the model. I shall talk to them about it.

Vince

John/Vince:

I really enjoyed the meeting the other day with you and a broad cross
section of your people.  Thank you very much for setting it up, and thank
you for giving me the opportunity to speak with your people.

As I mentioned to John, I am sending you the license paperwork for
MarketPoint.  I have attached our standard license agreement for your
consideration.  As I mentioned, the license agreement covers the entire
bundled product, which includes

?    North American gas, short and long term
?    North American electricity, short and long term
?    World gas
?    Western European gas
?    World oil

We are just finishing porting the world oil, world gas, and western
European
gas models over from our old (now obsolete) software system into
MarketPoint, so they will not be fully tested and complete for a couple of
months.  However, the gas and electricity models for North America are
presently complete and tested.  That should allow us to give you an
attractive price before the full worldwide toolkit is available throughout
your worldwide business.

As I understood it, you will want the gas modeling capability first and
will
want to defer decisions on electric or other capability.  As I mentioned at
the meeting, we are prepared to offer that for approximately 
 the fully
bundled price.  As you read the license agreement, you will see that the
software licenses for $100,000 annually, the gas data for $5,000, and the
electric data for $10,000.  MarketPoint will agree to license you the gas
model plus the data for 
 the software license plus the data license for a
total of $55,000 annually.  This is just under 
 the fully bundled price.
I
think that is consistent with the discussions at our meeting, and from
MarketPoint's perspective would provide a great basis to move forward
together with Enron.  If or when Enron ever desires to "scale up" to
another
model or model(s) from the MarketPoint portfolio, we will simply scale you
up to the entire license agreement.  This will allow you to decouple the
gas
decision from any other decisions you might make.  (I will be glad to put
this additional pricing provision into the agreement if you decide to move
forward.)

I felt I was able to communicate the philosophy, scope, and operation of
our
approach during the meeting and to deliver you much of the information you
might need to evaluate whether MarketPoint meets your needs.  I thought you
were able to see the depth and sophistication of the product yet at the
same
time its simplicity and effectiveness.  I thought you were able to see the
benefits of the MarketPoint dimension of economic equilibrium as a
complement and supplement to other approaches you will assuredly use.  I
would be interested in your impressions and those of your colleagues.  I
look forward to your response and to moving ahead together.  We view you as
a very important prospective customer and client and will work with you to
earn and secure your business.

If you decide to license MarketPoint, we can arrange to transfer and mount
MarketPoint and the short term NARG model (which is the model we suggest
you
begin with) and travel to Houston to deliver our 1 
 day training seminar.
Our clients are usually very fluent after that 1 
 day training seminar.
Thereafter, we would want you to work with the short term NARG model for a
few weeks while you get up to speed, very fluent, and very comfortable
before you take delivery of the longer term version of NARG several weeks
later.

Thanks again, and all the best.  If there is some item from the meeting
that
I might have forgotten to send, please remind me.  My notes don't show
anything, but I was speaking a lot rather than writing notes during the
meeting and might have overlooked something someone wanted.

Karla,

The wording you have below sounds reasonable as we would only use the code 
for internal valuation purposes.  

I also checked with Vince regarding the issues we discussed by phone 
yesterday.   He would like to specify a 2 day response time for the software 
support.  Also, he would like to specify that the payment schedule be:  50% 
at time of initial contract and 50% at the time when the software is 
released.   This would give them an incentive to release the software before 
the full year is over if they want to accelerate the payment.

Thanks again for all the help,

Stinson

Stinson,

While trying to put  together the agreements for D-G Energy, I have an 
additional question:

I need to know exactly what yall plan to do with the Source Code once you 
have it after the initial one year period is up?  There are still limitations 
as to what you can do with it, so I will need to know so we can try to revise 
the contract so that you will be legal.  

For example, in the language regarding release of the source code from 
escrow, it states that once you have the source code, you just have the 
"right to use, copy and modify the Source Code, solely for our internal 
purposes in connection with support, maintenance and operation of the 
Software".

Do yall plan to reverse engineer, decompile, etc?  Do you plan on using any 
of their code to create our own product?  If so - I think these are going to 
be a problem.  The latter would be an infringement issue, unless we were to 
contract to do so.  

Please let me know more details of your plan so I can see how we need to 
proceed in this area.

Thanks,
Karla

Go to http://www.winedt.com/, select downloads, and download  WinEdt5 to
your C drive.
On bottom of  the same page (download),  click on MiKTeX's Home Page,
click on MiKTeX 2.0, and download all the highlighted zip files.  You may
also
want to download miktex-2.0-manual.pdf.
You can then unzip all the files and follow the steps outlined in
miktex-2.0-manual.pdf to
install WinEdt and MiKTex.  However, the procedure to "Add MikTex bin
directory to PATH"
may not work. It's best to manually add the following to your path:
C:\texmf\miktex\bin;

This software is quite easy to use and very versatile. You can even include

Best,
Alex

to the group:

if you wish to use SAS, there are a few simple things you need to do:

1) you need to get a Unix password if you don't already have one (your user 
id will be the same as on the NT network, but a different password is issued)
2) you need a program called "Exceed" on your PC.  request it from IT (you 
already have this if you are already a user of LIM on the Unix platform)
3) you need an "ftp" program on your PC. you can go to www.download.com and 
download one (i like wsftp)
4) Exceed is funny in the way it runs. When you invoke Exceed (or LIM 
Advanced User (under Infobases) if you already have this) it will install 
itself the first time, and will then "disappear" to the Taskbar. you need to 
*right* click on the taskbar on Exceed, and then choose "Tools" and "Client 
Startup" and then "New."

You will enter a box which should already be set for REXEC and an XWindow 
emulation. You need to specify the Host Type as Sun, enter your User Name and 
Password, set the Host Name to: 

capers.ect.enron.com

and then, on the Command Line, type the following (carefully):

/usr/openwin/bin/xterm -display @D

Then, use the file menu to Save this as capers.xs and then click on the Run! 
menu. within a second or two, a window will open up with you logged into the 
serve capers. You are now on a Unix server, and the directory is your home 
directory. From here, if you simply type "sas" the 3 windows for an 
interactive session with SAS should open on your desktop. You are in business.

5) you also need to install your ftp. follow the procedures with the 
software, and then create a new session called "enron" where you choose as 
the server simply "earth" (do not add any further descriptors such as 
.enron.com). supply your user name and *unix* password, check the "remember 
password" box, and the default communication setups should be correct (eg, 
host type as "automatic detect").

when you invoke ftp and connect to enron, it will put you in your home 
directory on the Unix system, the same directory your xwindow comes up in 
under Exceed.

if you have any problems, i'll be happy to help

Clayton

Vince and Stinson,

I checked the file and the maintenance that automatically renews on 4/1/2000  
is for the following products:

All 4 of your @GLOBAL licenses
SPAV
SWING

I will go ahead and contact FEA and see about getting the renewal invoice for 
these.  I'll send it to Shirley for payment once I have it.


The products:  @INTEREST, SEAPC, and SEAPP have not been on maintenance for a 
while.  FEA told us a couple of years ago I believe that they do not have 
maintenance available for these products any longer.  So, you don't need to 
worry about cancelling @INTEREST.

Also, just FYI - your @ENERGY.1 and @ENERGY.2 licenses have maintenance 
through 10/20/2000.

If you have any questions, please let me know.  Otherwise, I will proceed 
with contacting FEA about you renewal of the @GLOBAL, SPAV, and SWING 
licenses.

Thanks,
Karla

Vince:

I was confused also - but I think this is the computer we ordered for
the new employee that is coming next week (Rakesh Bharati).  Phillip our 
IT floor tech said that the computer in the back room at EB1972G was very 
old and did not have much memory so I ordered a new one with an 
upgrade to bring it up to 196M (this is what Phillip said we need).  Also 
there 
is another computer back there that does not have much memory and we
ordered an upgrade for it (Jason's).  I went ahead an did it so that they 
would
be ready when the new employees come in.

Maureen already has her upgrade.

Subject: CPLEX

Stinson,
Krishna mentioned that Tom wants to buy (may have bought) Xpress. Tom's 
argument is that Xpress's language allows the user to express special ordered 
sets (certain types of constraints) in a convenient fashion. Chonawee and I 
just talked to two of Cplex's consultants (whom I know personally). They both 
mentioned that these sets are recognized and handled implicitly within Cplex. 
As a result, there is no need for their modeling language to express these 
constraints explicitly.
As a result, I feel that we should go with Cplex. Both Chonawee and Krishna 
seem to have the same impression. I need to get a final vote on this one so 
that we can order the licenses. This has been dragging on for too long.
-Samer
[Chonawee, my address book does not recognize ENA users. Please forward to 
Grant, Krishna, and Tom]

Your command:

                   SUBSCRIBE FRBNYRMAG1 Vince Kaminski

has  been received.  You must  now reply  to this  message (as  explained
below) to  complete your subscription.  The purpose of  this confirmation
procedure is to  check that the address  LISTSERV is about to  add to the
list for your subscription is reachable.  This is a typical procedure for
high-volume lists and  all new subscribers are subjected to  it - you are
not  being  singled  out.  Every  effort  has  been  made  to  make  this
verification as  simple and painless  as possible. Thanks in  advance for
your cooperation.

To confirm  the execution of your  command, simply point your  browser to
the following URL:

   http://peach.ease.lsoft.com/scripts/wa.exe?OK=4E46C824&L=FRBNYRMAG1

Alternatively, if  you have no WWW  access, you can reply  to the present
message and type  "ok" (without the quotes) as the  text of your message.
Just the word "ok" - do not  retype the command. This procedure will work
with any mail  program that fully conforms to the  Internet standards for
electronic  mail. If  you receive  an error  message, try  sending a  new
message  to  LISTSERV@PEACH.EASE.LSOFT.COM  (without  using  the  "reply"
function - this is very important) and  type "ok 4E46C824" as the text of
your message.

Finally, your  command will be  cancelled automatically if  LISTSERV does
not receive your confirmation within 48h. After that time, you must start
over and resend the command to get a new confirmation code. If you change
your mind and decide that you do  NOT want to confirm the command, simply
discard the present message and let the request expire on its own.

Hi Stinson,
?
Thanks for meeting with us on  Thursday.? We enjoyed
talking with you.
?
As per our discussion, I have attached  the course 
outline of Java for Managers along with this  email.
After our conversation with you we think this  course 
may be a  little bit heavy for your group.? But we can definetly
take it down to concepts level and make it  appropriate for
our audience.? Please review and let me know,  if this 
course would be of value to you.? This is a 3 day course 
and costs $11,000 (maximum of 15  students).
?
Regards,
?

Dear Vince Kaminski,

This is to inform you of the release of @ENERGY 2.0. FTP download
instructions are available immediately. The download instructions are
included at the end of this email. Your CD's and manuals will be shipped to
you within 2 weeks. Please see below for more information regarding this new
release.

Please confirm that you are the correct recipient for this shipment and your
address above is correct by clicking reply and send. If any changes need to
be made, please make the changes above and reply.

**WARNING: PLEASE NOTE THAT IF YOU DID NOT RECEIVED A LICENSE KEY FOR
@ENERGY AFTER JUNE 2000, YOU WILL NEED TO CONTACT SUPPORT@FEA.COM OR CALL
510.548.6200 TO OBTAIN A NEW LICENSE KEY TO ENABLE THE NEW VERSION.**

**Swing users: @ENERGY/Swing now replaces the "SWING" product. See the
@ENERGY user manual for a discussion of the changes. Contact FEA for the
necessary license keys. You will be able to run both the new and old SWING
simultaneously.

Heres an overview of the new and changed features since version 1.6:


@ENERGY (Forward Curve)
Jump parameters are now calibrated for use in other @ENERGY functions.
Inputs and outputs to POWERCALIB and COMCALIB have changed. See the
corresponding function syntax in the User Guide for additional information.
35-40% speed improvement. The module is now out of beta.

@ENERGY (Basics)
Different interpolation schemes on forward prices are now supported. If you
use INDEXSWAP , EXOTICSWAP, or OPTINDEXSWAP with floating price linked to a
series of futures dates, such futures dates need not be close to dates
specified in the forward curve input.  A new utility function, PATHUTIL,
allows you  to simulate and visualize price paths consistent with the models
supported by @ENERGY. 25-30% speed improvement.

@ENERGY (Advanced)
Different interpolation schemes on forward prices are now supported. If you
use OPTDIFFSWAP or DIFFSWAP  with floating price linked to a series of
futures dates, such futures dates need not be close to dates specified in
the forward curve input. CALSPREADOPT now allows for the specification of

FYI

- Exotic Library :
 
Issue :  The London version is different from the Houston version.
  The problem is that some bugs in the London version were found.

Temporary solution: Bugs were immediately fixed at a local level.

Permanent Solution:  The London Exotic Version will be replaced by the 
Houston Exotic Version.
   The Houston Version is expected to be robust. 
   Sharad (London Research) is spending this coming week in Houston. 
   When Sharad is back to London, the Houston version will replace the London 
version.

Approach:  Steven Leppard is designing a regression testing procedure that 
will involve IT to fully test the similarity of the two versions.
  The procedure is expected to take at least one month from commencement.
  Hopefully, no discrepancies will be found.
  In the adverse case it happens, it will be necessary to conduct an analysis 
to decide what is wrong.
  If necessary  further testing and development has to take place.

Hello Vince :

I'm the Territory Manager for the MathWorks, we develop MATLAB technical
software. We've recently developed tools well suited for Energy Trading
Industry.

Enron has used our products in the past, but all of those end-users have
left Enron.

Risk Management and Research groups at Southern Energy, TXU, Dynegy, El
Paso Energy, Koch, Calpine, Reliant and others have recently started using
our products in the following ways.

1. Create sophisticated option pricing models, risk analysis models, and
stress analysis models. Creating GUI front ends for the end-users.
2. Pull in Data from ODBC, Corba, and SAS databases to evaluate.
3. Visualize the results and quantify the solution.
4. Compile these models and distribute these applications to their
Traders, Analysists and Managers with no distribution costs.

Who should I contact at your company to discuss Enron's situation to see if
our can help Enron as it has with our other Energy customers?


Thank you for your time and help.

Kevin,

UPDATE: One vendor has not provided enough information for me to give you an 
"apples to apples" comparison, so I have sent him an urgent e-mail message 
for him to provide clarification on some points.

All being well, we will have the info. to you sometime on Monday = If the 
Vendor I mentioned above does not get back to me on Monday, I will send you 
the quote I have on file from Danka.

  Thanks for your patience,                    Iain.................

Oh, ok, I didn't know that. - wish I lived in France for August then.  As 
long as it is ok with you that we don't get this purchased soon.  I just 
wanted to make sure I did everything I could to get the software for you.

Thanks,

Dear Ms. Geman,

I met with Vince Kaminski yesterday regarding picking back up with the 
license agreement we were working on back in March.  He relayed some 
additional requirements which need to be added to the agreement, which 
include the following:

 1. The price agreed upon is $90,000.
 2. D-G will provide system support.
3. No later than 12 months of execution of the agreement, D-G will provide 
the source code to Enron.  In the meantime, the source code is to be in 
escrow.  Additionally, the source code would be released sooner than the 12 
months if any of the following conditions occur:  (i) D-G goes out of 
business; (ii) D-G is unable to provide effective technical support; or (iii) 
if D-G agrees to release it sooner.

Before I have our attorney add these things to the agreement, we need to 
discuss the escrow situation.  Vince mentioned that you had suggested that 
your attorney keep the software in escrow.   Is your attorney a U.S. 
attorney?  It seems like I may have recalled that way back in March you might 
have said you had a friend or relative that was an attorney.  Is that the 
same person?  Does this attorney work for a large firm, small firm, or solo 
practitioner?  Basically, if you could just provides some additional 
information about your attorney, I would appreciate it.

We normally would use an Escrow company to put the software in escrow.  We 
have dealt with a company here in the U.S. called DSI Technology.  I will 
check into that pending your answer regarding your attorney.

Once we decide what we want to do regarding placing the software in escrow, 
we will red-line the agreement to reflect such changes and e-mail it back to 
you for your review.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Stinson,

He is looking for blanket approach to our disk, both read and write.
Is it legitimate?

Mr. Roberts, 

I am glad we were able to reach a practical solution for you without going 
too much against the grain of Enron Corp.'s  IT Policy  and Standards.  
Thanks to David Wile and Mark Hall in formulating a solution that addresses 
everyone's needs. 

In summary, 
Your Contingency and Recovery machine (laptop) will be imaged for Win2000
Applications will be evaluated for compatibility

This will allow you to use the machine as a back-up to gather weather data 
off the Internet (via independent dial-out line) in case the normal Enron 
network architecture is unavailable. 

I will follow-up to make sure we capture the one exception to the Policy and 
Standard that surfaced (Local Admin Rights on the laptop for development 
activity). IRM/Roberto Deleon will facilitate with a Risk Acceptance Request 
form. 

Thanks again, 
Henry Moreno

What I have:
A. I have an IBM Thinkpad and a cd for Windows 98
B. I got the IBM from Richard Weeks. I bought the Windows 98.
C. I have a valid business need to get Windows 98 on the IBM
  a. My job requires a totally independent backup to access data off the 
internet and process same for trader's report
  b. This must be done 7 days per week in the early am.
  c. I have new equipment that doesn't run on NT
   i. audio file generator (nomad)
   ii. video file generator (intel)
   d. I will also be loading Office 2000 (which I have)

The problem:
A. When I travel, terminal server doesn't work (last time I spent several 
$hundred trying)
B. On the weekends, Terminal server unacceptably slow (requiring someone to 
come in Sat & Sun)
C. When we move internally, things go wrong (this monday we got switched from 
100megabytes to 10 mega bytes) - trader's report not ready on time
D. I currently have no stand-alone backup for contingency purposes
 
What I need:

 I need help putting Windows 98 put on my Thinkpad

 (When I reformatted and loaded, it did not recognize the modem)

There should be no security risk because this system will be totally 
independent of Enorn system (just usinf the phone)


CAN YOU APPROVE SOMEONE TO HELP ME LOAD IT UP???  Thank you.

Dear Ms. Geman,

I met with Vince Kaminski yesterday regarding picking back up with the 
license agreement we were working on back in March.  He relayed some 
additional requirements which need to be added to the agreement, which 
include the following:

 1. The price agreed upon is $90,000.
 2. D-G will provide system support.
3. No later than 12 months of execution of the agreement, D-G will provide 
the source code to Enron.  In the meantime, the source code is to be in 
escrow.  Additionally, the source code would be released sooner than the 12 
months if any of the following conditions occur:  (i) D-G goes out of 
business; (ii) D-G is unable to provide effective technical support; or (iii) 
if D-G agrees to release it sooner.

Before I have our attorney add these things to the agreement, we need to 
discuss the escrow situation.  Vince mentioned that you had suggested that 
your attorney keep the software in escrow.   Is your attorney a U.S. 
attorney?  It seems like I may have recalled that way back in March you might 
have said you had a friend or relative that was an attorney.  Is that the 
same person?  Does this attorney work for a large firm, small firm, or solo 
practitioner?  Basically, if you could just provides some additional 
information about your attorney, I would appreciate it.

We normally would use an Escrow company to put the software in escrow.  We 
have dealt with a company here in the U.S. called DSI Technology.  I will 
check into that pending your answer regarding your attorney.

Once we decide what we want to do regarding placing the software in escrow, 
we will red-line the agreement to reflect such changes and e-mail it back to 
you for your review.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Kevin,

Please see the following websites for features and specifications of the 
color copiers currently available to Enron and pricing is on an attacment @ 
the bottom of the mesage. Let me know if you would like to meet with any of 
the Reps or if Vince/Mike/Shirley or yourself would want to take a trip to 
the vendor location for demonstrations on any of the equipment listed below.

These color copiers are only supported by the Vendor and the lease would be 
between your group and the relative Vendor. Response times have been 
specified as 4 hr from the time the call is placed to the Vendor Tech 
arriving during normal business hours. After hours service is available @ 
premium rates, yet to be quoted = Let me know if you require this after hours 
service pricing.

EPSC Key-Op does not currently support color copier equipment and as such, 
someone in your group would receive the necessary training for low level 
maintenance {Jams/Toner/Staples etc}. You would also need to store the 
necessary supplies for the selected Color Copier.

Kevin,

I am not sure by what date you require a color copier but if you can wait 
until April, Lanier has let me know that they ARE going to release their NEW 
22 Copy Per Minute color copier @ that time. Please look @ the attached 
spreadsheet and compare the cost with the $ 24 CPM Canon copier sent to you 
on 01/31/2000:


Let me know what you think.

    Thanks,            Iain.................

Richard et al

Under the New Electricity Trading Arrangments (NETA) in the UK and looking 
forward I think it will be increasingly important in modelling market 
behaviour and transmission related costs to have some form of system model 
incorporating OPF and ATC.

Therefore, in principle I am happy to support Option 3 and to pay a 1/3 share 
of the cost. However, before I commit to this particular package, I would 
like to be comfortable that the generic Powerworld software could be suitably 
customised to capture the special features of NETA.

I understand Marco Verreschi who initiated interest from our end is pursuing 
this with Martin Lin (Research, Houston).  However, due to commitments next 
week, and my desire to see Powerworld in action etc it is likely to be the 
following week before he and I can say "lets do it".

Gentleman,

Kevin Presto concurred on the purchase of a site license as recommended by 
Vince.  What are the thoughts of others?  I am available to demo the package 
if others would like to see it.

Gentlemen,

I recommend that we purchase this package and split the cost 3 ways between 3 
power trading desks.
I think that we should go for option 3 (~ $15,000).

Lance Cunningham in my group looked at this software package and found it 
very useful for modeling transmission problems.
Please, feel free to ask him for technical details in support of this 
recommendation.

Vince,

We have three options to increase our availability across Enron for the Power 
World load flow software.

Option 1, Upgrade to a site license for the load flow software only. Price 
$9,990.00 
This would give all of Enron the ability to perform load flows, but not 
determine marginal cost or available transfer capacity (ATC) because only the 
Optimal Power Flow (OPF) version can perform that task.

Option 2, Site license for the load flow and purchase 1 OPF package for 
Walter Coffer's group.  Price $11,240.
This would give all of Enron  the ability to perform load flows and one other 
group the ability to determine marginal cost and ATC.

Option 3, Site license for load flows, OPF and ATC.  Price $14,990.00
This would give all of Enron  the ability to perform load flows, marginal 
cost, and ATC.

Regards,
Lance

Jim,

CHARM looks more like  a prototype that requires a lot of work to make it 
more a
production tool.

We have developed a similar model (without some nice functionalities CHARM 
has)
in about two weeks, at request of Rick Jones who joined EES from HSB. Rick
worked on a similar model at his old company  and wanted to have a similar 
tool
for his projects with Enron. I can tell you more about it when we meet 
(hopefully) later
this week. 

I would tell Willis that the model requires more work before Enron can
consider it as commercial product.

Vince

Mr. Huang,

We would be happy to demonstrate the features and functionality of the
WeatherDelta tool set for your team at Enron.  Early next week (Tuesday or
Wednesday) are both possible, as well as early the following week.  The
demonstration can take 90 minutes or more, depending on the number of
questions and the level of detail.

Ideally, you could provide us with some of your data and we could
demonstrate how to value a full-requirements contract to service that
particular load.  To do this we will need one or more years of hourly
consumption data, and the general location of the load.  Ideal data formats
are csv files of either 365 rows x 25 columns (date,hr1,hr2..) or 8760 rows
x 3 columns (date,hr,load).  In lieu of using your data, we will provide
sample load data.

Please feel free to call me and we can discuss schedules and the particulars
of the product overview and demonstration.

Thank you for your interest,

Michael J. Denton

Julie:

I talked to both Maureen and Tanya and neither one want this service and
have not been using it.  

Maureen told me that she told you a year ago that she did not want Telerate 
(when she was supporting Gary Hickerson's group on 30).  If that is the case, 
we probably need a refund.

Let me know if there is anything that can be done about this.

The only person in our group that wants Telerate is Jason Sokolov and I
put in a request for that yesterday.  Please cancel everything else.

Thanks!

Shirley

Hi Shirley,
 Regarding Telerate:  I can cancel the service for both Maurenn and Tanya, but another name commonly used for the Telerate application is Bridge or Bridgestation so you may want to just ask the two of them once more to be sure that they do not use it.  Just let me know and I will cancel billing

Jason can get access to it by submitting an e-request for him for Telerate.  When you go into E-request and it is prompting you for what application to choose, type in the words Market Data and hit Search.  Telerate will pop up as an option and within that choose the role Basic Energy.  We will take care of it from there.

I will also remove Hector Campos from Reuters.  Was there anyone else being charged for Reuters services that are not needed?

I will also remove Clayton Vernon.  I do not see anything under the name Brad Amoine, is this the correct spelling of his name?  I will also find
out where Shalesh's charges should be moved to.

Thanks for updating us and let me know if there is anything else.

Julie

Hi Shirley.  I've copied this to Julie Pechersky, who maintains the Market Data database, and will be able to make the user changes you request.  She'll also be able to tell you how / when Telerate can be enabled for Mr. Sokolov.

We get the billing data from her, so once it is correct there, it will be billed correctly.

Subject:	Various Market Data Charges to the Research Group for February 2001

Clifford:

In reviewing our February EIS Billing Summary for Co#0413, CC#107043,
I have several questions.

Telerate: (February charges: $3,032,35)
I polled the group and only one person has asked for Telerate and he is
not shown being charged for it.    That is Jason Sokolov.  He would like to
have access to Telerate.  If you could let me know how to get that for him.

The largest percent of the Telerate charges appear to be for Maureen
Raymond, who says that she does not use Telerate.  Could she be accessing
some data that she does not know is Telerate?  Please let me know.  If there
are individual accounts for Telerate the only one we need is for Jason Sokolov,
unless Maureen's charges are for something that she does not know is Telerate.
Tanya Tamarchenko does not need Telerate and she has the second largest
percentage of the charges.  Anyway, the only Telerate subscription we need is
for Jason Sokolov.

Reuters: (February charges:  $405.96)
No one in Research uses Reuters.  I believe most of the charges are for Hector 
Campos who used it when he was on the trading desk.  When he rotated into the 
Research group he did not need it any longer, but is still being billed for it.  Please 
remove from the Research Cost Center.

The following individuals are no longer with Enron or no longer with Research
and their accounts should be removed from the Research Cost Center.

Clayton Vernon		No longer with the Research Group	Remove his LIM/LIM/EXCEL and LIM Core charges from the Research Cost Center
Brad Amoine		No longer with Enron			Remove his LIM/LIM/EXCEL and LIM Core charges from the Research Cost Center
Shalesh Ganjoo	No longer with the Research Group	Remove his LIM and LIM Core charges from the Research Cost Center

I hope this is not too confusing!
 
Please advise.

Thanks!

Shirley Crenshaw

Karla,

We may use 1 workstation in London, 1 in Houston.

Yes, please call Ms. Geman and ask for more detailed price information.

Hello Vince,

I didn't know if that was your correct e-mail address listed below on 
receiving from outside the company, so I thought I would forward this with a 
couple of comments.

She states below that she has enclosed a proposal, however, the only pricing 
I really see is in the Software License Agreement, Article 2, which states 
that the license fee is $100,000 and lists out when you must pay for it.  It 
then states in Article 3 that the fees are set forth in Appendix 1, but there 
are no prices in Appendix 1.  

I have reviewed the actual terms and conditions to the license and am going 
to prepare it as we usually do to send to Mark Holsworth for review.  In the 
meantime, do you want me to go back to Ms. Geman and ask her for more 
detailed pricing information or do you have what you need?  Also, in Appendix 
2, you will need to list the number of sites and workstations you want to 
have.  

Please let me know.

Thanks,
Karla

Dear Ms.Feldman,
Please find enclosed a proposal for the D-G Energy
Software license agreement in which Enron may be
interested.We deliberately left blank the Appendix 2
related to the number of sites and workstations it
would cover ,in order to let Dr.Kaminski decide what
 is best for Enron.

Friends:

I spoken with most of you over the last few weeks regarding the new
version of AURORA due to be released tomorrow.  We've broken a lot of
new ground with this version, and  this version will serve as our
official launch into the Eastern U.S.  We've worked closely with our
Eastern customers, and responded to the needs of the market.  Some of
the enhancements:

AURORA SOFTWARE MODELING ENHANCEMENTS:
* Energy Storage-Resources (Pumped hydro)
* Market Areas: no limit on number of areas
* Transmission: congestion pricing.
* Price Caps
* Risk Analysis
* Modeling Enhancements via VB Scripting: "Update Data" capability

GENERAL CAPABILITIES
* AURORA's run time speed improved again.
* File transfers to EPIS
* Interface Enhancements

REPORTING ENHANCEMENTS
* Marginal Resource reporting
* Resource operations reporting
* Resource stacks detail consolidated

AURORA DATABASES
* East-Central AURORA Database -- 25 market areas modeled with 11
market areas in New York ISO.
* WSCC AURORA Database -- updated IPP resources
* ERCOT AURORA Database - updated resources
* All databases updated to use the new modeling capabilities


As AURORA continues to grow, and we meet the needs of the market, we
have made several procedural changes.  We continue to offer free 7-day
demos to those companies that want to take a look at the model, and get
a brief idea of how it thinks and feels.  After that 7-day demo period
we now offer either a discount for moving into a full license, or we
offer a 60-day trial for $10,000.00  --We also now offer more options
for the licensing of the model.  Annual Licenses are priced as follows:

Single User (1 User / 1 PC)
$33,000.00
Limited-Use (1 User / Multiple PCs  OR  Multiple Users / 1 PC)
$45,000.00
Two-User (2 Users / 2 PCs)
$55,000.00
Site License (Unlimited Users/PCs excluding Affiliates)
$79,000.00
Affiliate-Site (Unlimited Users/PCs including Affiliates)
$99,000.00



For additional information, please contact me, and I'll speak with you
about how AURORA can help you in your specific operations and projects.

Mike,

Following request has been made for a number of people.

The access requested is: o:\research\power meteorology\weather temperatures - 
Read/Write
 Data Approval  Grant  

This is what I wrote, denying the request:

The reason for the rejection has been communicated  several times.
The person who requested the access does not want it any more.  Granting both 
read/write access could threaten the integrity of the data.


Any comments?

Vince

We also need to order another regular computer like the others that have

and her location on the 19th floor is EB 1940.  Tanya has two offices and
does not have a computer in her office on the 19th floor.

Hi Shirley,
I would like to request for a new PC.  My current PC is quite old with not 
enough memory.  Twice 
I ran out of memory and had to have IT people coming to clean it for me. 
Their suggestion is
to either get a new hard drive or a new PC.  Given that Dell has Pentiumc III 
Processor at 800 MHz
on market, I would like to request a PC with process at 500 MHz or higher 
level. 
Thank you very much.

Best,
Alex

I gave you local admin rights on your laptop yesterday. What you have to do is to log into the laptop using the local
Machine account. The id and the password is the same as your Corp login now. The password on the local account will 
Never change. If you have a minute today I will show you how. Let me know a time.

Phillip,

How can I install new programs on my laptop, without 
the administrator's privileges?

One example: when I travel I use AOL to get access to my mail
and to communicate with the office. Windows 2000 does not allow 
me to install it.

 Also, I have my private statistical software
I often use when I work at night during business trips.
I would like to load it as well.

Vince

He should access ECI on our equipment, and the work that he is doing for ENA

Can he bring his current pc with him, or can you provide him with another

Goodmorning Vince,
This is a very much needed fax machine.
Mike gave approval for the new fax machine, also I spoke with Shirley 
concerning this matter.
We have some new clients that requires faxes with long distance locations
and the new fax machine will ensure that it reaches them in record time.

                                                       Thanks

Kevin,

Per your request, please see below:

******************************************************************************
***************************************
New Facsimile Machine Information

Please take a look @ the following and let me know, which FAX machine you 
choose or if you need information on something smaller, then I will have the 
Vendor contact you directly to finalise installation.  An Enron Director or 
above {With Signature Authority to legally bind Enron to a contract} will 
have to sign off on the contract paperwork before the fax machine can be 
installed. Delivery times on new machines are normally 3-5 working days but 
either Vendor listed below will be able to provide a "Loaner" should you have 
a business need. Please discuss the Fax Machine Install Date with the Rep 
when ordering the equipment.

If there is no existing fax line present, you will need to send a Notes-Mail 
to the Move Team {Erica @ x3-3185 or Janelle @ x5-7917} requesting the 
installation of a new fax line. The Move Team can be found in the Notes-Mail 
"ECT Address Book".

If you are an EES employee, you must first get new equipment approval from 
EES Budget Control. Contact Susan McLeroy @ x5-8066 or via Notes-Mail.

If you are an EBS employee, you must first get new equipment approval from 
EBS Purchasing & Budget Control. Contact Paula Corey @ x3-9948 or Martha 
Reyna @ x3-3491. You can reach both of these people via Notes-Mail.

If you are an ENA employee, you must first get new equipment approval from 
ENA Finance & Budget Control. Contact Lorie Belsha @ x3-9617 or via 
Notes-Mail.


A note on the fax machines listed below:
All the machines listed below come with a 2nd paper tray and Upgraded memory 
{Maxed by model~See Below} as an Enron Standard from each Vendor.
All the fax machines listed below have a modem speed rated @ 33.6 Kbps versus 
the Canon LaserClass 7500 {Example only} @ 14.4 Kbps = New fax machine should 
be noticeably quicker.
Document feeder capacity of the machines listed below are the same as the 
Canon LaserClass 7500             {Example only}
Maintenance = Models listed below have Maintenance/Repair coverage included 
in monthly $ total. There is NO separate agreement! Toner/Drum cartridges + 
paper + line charges are extra {Not quoted}

Contract pricing can change without warning, so please let me know ASAP if a 
Vendor quotes you a different price to those listed below against the various 
models.

If the fax machine is to be used in a trading type environment, here are some 
considerations:
No more than 20 people per fax machine = Take a look @ the fax machine 
placement on EB30 or EB31.
Disregard any fax machine that does not have a 33.6K Modem and JBIG 
compression {or equivalent}.
Look for memory upgrades & 2nd paper tray included in monthly cost. {Models 
quoted are loaded}.
Maintenance is to be INCLUDED in Monthly Cost {Models quoted are covered}.

The above machines are designed for workgroup use.
Q) How many people will be using this fax machine?
Q) How much usage will this fax machine have? 
{i.e. Heavy = 40 faxes per day @ 20 pages/60 faxes per day @ 2-3 pages or a 
lot less? If "HEAVY", either the PB2050, PB9930 or  UF885/UF895 should fit 
your needs = If 15-40, the PB9830 would probably be a better fit}

*********************
CONTRACT DETAILS     
The Fax programs are an agreement between each end user of the fax machine 
and the relevant Vendor, as follows:

Pitney Bowes
36 month RENTAL.
30 day notice for termination of contract.

*********************
Please note the following

The Facsimile Machine Agreement is between the Enron Business Unit/Department 
requesting the Facsimile Machine and the Vendor.

The User or Requester of the Fax machine is responsible for invoice payment.

Enron Property & Services Corporation is NOT responsible for the coding, 
processing or payment of Facsimile {FAX} machine invoices.

In order to return any old fax machine equipment, you must contact the 
leasing company that supplied the equipment and send them a certified letter 
that terminates the agreement. If you terminate a contract within the 
original agreement period, you may be liable for penalty charges as a lot of 
Fax Machines are on a non-cancellable lease agreement. The Vendor who 
supplied the fax equipment will be able to let you know of any outstanding $ 
amounts for your existing equipment. 

If you are asked to pay outstanding $ amounts, be aware that some Vendors 
include the cost of outright PURCHASE of the old fax equipment = From the 
contracts I have reviewed so far, you are under NO obligation to purchase the 
old equipment.

IKON CONTACT NAME FOR RETURNS:
Beth Frank: Phone = New # --> 409-441-1262 {Previously 281-355-6274}

*** Please call me or e-mail me if it is a different Vendor name on the 
machine and I will respond with a contact name ***

Charges for fax machines are dependant upon manufacturer & model, with the 
person responsible for the fax machine, paying the invoice. You MUST notify 
the Vendor of any changes relating to Fax Machine assignment {even if it is 
within the same group} = Who the machine has been reassigned to {Contact 
name}, the new contact phone # AND the location of the machine.

Go to http://www.winedt.com/, select downloads, and download  WinEdt5 to

On bottom of  the same page (download),  click on MiKTeX's Home Page,
click on MiKTeX 2.0, and download all the highlighted zip files.  You may
also
want to download miktex-2.0-manual.pdf.
You can then unzip all the files and follow the steps outlined in
miktex-2.0-manual.pdf to
install WinEdt and MiKTex.  However, the procedure to "Add MikTex bin
directory to PATH"
may not work. It's best to manually add the following to your path:
C:\texmf\miktex\bin;

This software is quite easy to use and very versatile. You can even include
colored picture in your tex document.

Best,

Stinson,
Enclosed are the details of the CPLEX purchase. If everyone agrees, I will
assume that EBS is responsible for 1/3 of the cost (with Taxes etc. must be
close to $15,000).
Krishna and Grant, what do you think?

Subject:  Revised ILOG quote 5-25-00


Hi Chonawee,

You are right, I did make a mistake on the calculation, though it isn't
exactly 2/3 of the previous 3 pak quote. Sorry about that and so glad you
caught it. I multiplied by 1.5 and I meant to use 1.3.  We have discounted
deployment paks which we discount by quantity.  Our chart starts with a 3
pak so I took that number from our price list and multiplied by 1.3 to get
14,560.00.  For 2 deployments, I take $4,500 for one, plus 10% off for the
second license 4,050, then times 1.3 = 11,115.00.  Here is the revised
quote.  I checked the other numbers again and they are correct. Again, I am
sorry for the mistake.

Regards,

Hi Shirley,
I would like to request for a new PC.  My current PC is quite old with not 
enough memory.  Twice 
I ran out of memory and had to have IT people coming to clean it for me. 
Their suggestion is
to either get a new hard drive or a new PC.  Given that Dell has Pentiumc III 
Processor at 800 MHz
on market, I would like to request a PC with process at 500 MHz or higher 
level. 
Thank you very much.

Best,
Alex

OUTLOOK EMAIL NOTIFICATION

Your Date of Migration is: May 7th

YOU WILL BE UNABLE TO SEND E-MAIL unless you take the following action:
Please go through your Notes email and clean out as many old/un-needed email items as possible BEFORE your date of migration.  After you are migrated to Outlook you will only be allocated 100MB of total Mailbox space.   If more than this amount of data is migrated to Outlook YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEND E-MAIL until it is below the 100MB limit.  Cleaning up your Notes email now will prevent this from happening to YOU.

Enron's messaging platform is migrating from Lotus Notes to Microsoft Outlook 2000 worldwide.  You will be accessing Outlook for all of your email functions. 

WHY IS ENRON MIGRATING TO OUTLOOK 2000?

Many factors contributed to the decision to migrate from Lotus Notes to Microsoft Exchange/Outlook.  The most prominent factors were:

?	Significant advantages to moving to a product that is more integrated with current Enron apps (Windows 2000, Office and Internet Explorer)
?	More efficient Shared PC and Roaming User features
?	Improved support and integration for Palm/CE devices
?	Instant Messaging capabilities

WHAT IS BEING MIGRATED TO OUTLOOK 2000?

?	Email Messages.  From the date of your scheduled migration, the last (30) thirty days of your Email will be converted for use in Outlook.
?	All your folders in Notes you use to store email messages in.
?	To Do Items
?	Journal Items
?	Calendar Entries dating from (1) one year in the past to (10) ten years in the future will be converted.
?	Address Books, but NOT your Distribution Lists that you created.  You will need to re-create these in Outlook.

Thank you,

Outlook 2000 Migration Team

Steve,

Please, let  me know when you come back.
I have detected a tendency to implement different
approaches to valuation in the past.

To some extent, it reflects the absence of formal 
rules for sign-off on the valuation techniques
which, in turn, reflects,  the turf wars and the desire by the 
originators to control the outcomes.

Vince

Vince,

I'd like an opportunity to talk to you about valuation.

I'm hearing confusing messages about the way that the UK IT team and the UK 
traders get their Valuation code aparently signed off by Research, while 
here... You provide it for our guys to wrap up.

We have now a situation where the UK team are using a home grown Valuation 
piece called DOVE, where results differ from those of the equivalent USA 
portcalc.

I need to break through the pride barriers and the "not built here" syndrome, 
and try to do the right thing, but I don't beleive I can do that without you 
guidance.

I'm scared that if we diverge too much we will never work globally on these 
systems.

Robert Johnston has asked me to charge Vince's department for 1/3 of the cost 
of the annual subscription to IIF.  The annual cost is $47K.  Therefore the 
cost for 1/3 is $15,666.67.  This information is for Maureen Raymond's use.

I will be happy to process the invoice for payment but in order for me to do 
so, I will need the proper coding for Vince's department.

Please let me know if you are agreeable to this.  If you have questions, you 
may wish to contact Robert Johnston directly at 3-9934.

Thanks,
Sharon

Molly,

I met Lou in the building lobby last Wednesday and he suggested that he
(or his representatives) join the Mathworks presentation to my group).

It's a good software package for mathematical modeling,
 but there is a limit to the number of different installations any group
can productively use.

I shall take a look at some new features they offer
and decide whether it's worth the effort.

Hello Mr. Casari:

Myself and our Energy Trading Financial Team will be visiting with the R&D
group at Enron the week of 10/16/00.  They have several applications can be
dramatically improved with our tools.

We are very interested to understand the Bandwidth Trading Market, to see
if any additional challanges can be overcome with our tools. 

I would like to understand your challanges of modeling, simulating and
deploying applications to control risk.

Are you available to discuss these items prior to our visit?

I look forward to hearing from you.
Thanks

In response to your email to Vince Kaminski of 3/19/01, the subject invoice
was sent to our Accounting Dept. for payment on February 25, 2001.  We
did not need the SPAV maintenance, so we deducted $1,600.00.  Did you
receive a payment in the amount of $4100.00 that could possibly have been
payment for this invoice?

I have left a message for our accounting dept. to see exactly when the invoice
was paid and the check number.  As soon as I hear from them I will left you
know.

Hi Stinson,
 
Thanks for meeting with us on  Thursday.  We enjoyed
talking with you.
 
As per our discussion, I have attached  the course 
outline of Java for Managers along with this  email.
After our conversation with you we think this  course 
may be a  little bit heavy for your group.  But we can definetly
take it down to concepts level and make it  appropriate for
our audience.  Please review and let me know,  if this 
course would be of value to you.  This is a 3 day course 
and costs $11,000 (maximum of 15  students).
 
Regards,

Vince,

Tanya and I feel that there is a need for a constrained optimization routine 
for our VAR related research.   Numerical recipes does not contain 
subroutines where equality and inequality contraints can be easily 
incorporated.  Also, the number of arguments that can be handled is also 
limited.

IMSL provides a comprehensive library of more than 300 C/C++  statistical and 
mathematical analysis functions.  We think that it would be of great value to 
our efforts and to the efforts of our research group.  Presently the cost is 
aproximately around $1500 and Mike Bothwell (Visual Numerics Rep) assures us 
as the version is not license protected, we all can use it as long as 
simultaneous usage is within the license.

Please let me know if you should need further information.

Thanks,

Rakesh

Rakesh,

As we discussed, the CNL 4.0 PC libraries are not license managed.  Version
5 will be.  The PC Version 4.0 can be installed on a network drive and
called from networked PCs.  As expected, we would ask that Enron honor the
license agreement by allowing only the number of simultaneous uses permitted
by the license.  Version 5.0 will be license managed and can be licensed as
node locked or floating.

With regard to Unix licensing, the current version of CNL for Unix is
license managed.  It can be licensed as node locked or floating.  If you
install the libraries on a Unix server as node locked, the number of
simultaneous sessions on that server is not limited except by the
capabilities of the machine.  A floating Unix license would be checked out
by the individual user to be executed on a local machine.

Also as mentioned, your investment is protected by allowing you to upgrade
in the future by paying only the price difference between your current and
desired platforms.  This upgrade option only applies to licenses covered
under support.

If you have any additional questions, please let me know.  I look forward to
providing you the best math and statistical libraries available today to
help you solve your problems and understand your data.

Ms. Geman,

I apologize for the delay, but I finally have drafted an Escrow Agreement for 
placing the software in escrow with your attorneys.  Please review and have 
your attorneys review and let me know if it is acceptable.

I will be leaving the department I have been working in and moving to a 
different Enron subsidiary on October 13.  If at all possible, could we try 
to get the Software License Agreement and the Escrow Agreement wrapped up 
before I leave so that someone else does not have to try to pick up where I 
left off?

I think we are just about in agreement on the Software License portion.  
Seems like the only outstanding question had to do with your concern 
regarding providing a response time of 2 business days.  I do not have any 
answers regarding that - maybe Vince Kaminski or Stinson Gibner can respond 
on this issue.  

I look forward to hearing from you and trying to get this finalized within 
the next 2 weeks if possible.

Thank you,

Thanks for your immediate response.
The problem seems to be the cost.

Iain , I have the smallest group but we are
 willing to pay what it takes for the copier.
On the other hand there may be other groups
that are larger and may not need the copier
as much and are not willing to pay the cost.

Seems to me,the copier is a necessity for the floor,
it would save not only time ,but money also 
in the long haul.

We have updated every possibility on the
32nd floor and this copier is needed for quick
presentations, meetings, etc.  and allows everyone
not to depend on color printers as much !

(Gives us choices)

Please after today , once we get together regarding
this matter , I will let Ina continue with the process,
whereby , I can continue focusing on what is best
for my group as well as the floor.

                                     Thanks

Stinson,

I have added a time bomb and security file check to the model.

We are ready to  release it to Brad, and improve the model from his feed back.

Vince:

I did get the proposal out today, but after close of business your time.
Sorry for the brief delay.  You will find two attachments.  The first is our
time and materials contract, which will need to be executed if you want to
do the test project.  The second is an addendum to that time and materials
contract under Section H, which allows for specific work statements to amend
and supersede the general consulting agreement.  The general consulting
agreement (termsandconditions.doc) contains all the confidentiality, billing
rate, and other provisions that your contract people will probably want and
provides a general framework for doing business.  The work statement
(testproject.doc) contains the specific provisions for our standard weeklong
onsite test project.

I hope we get the opportunity to serve you and ultimately to make
MarketPoint available to you.  In light of the contiguity to the holidays, I
dont think it would be realistic to try to schedule this test project before
then, probably from your perpsective as well as ours.  Let's think about
doing it the first opportunity in January if you decide to go forward if
that is OK with you.

All the best.
Dale

Vince & Stinson,

Just wanted to let you know that I had sent this e-mail below to Ms. Geman 
last Friday and have not heard back from her.  I'm sure she is very busy - 
but just wanted you to know that I am waiting on a response from her.

In the meantime, I did a couple of things:  

1.  I checked with Global Strategic Sourcing's attorney just for her input 
and opinion on having Ms. Geman's attorney hold the software in escrow and 
she said it would depend on whether it was a U.S. attorney and that we would 
probably need to get more information on the attorney.  So, I had sent these 
questions as listed below on to Ms. Geman.

2.  I checked into the cost of an escrow agreement with a company that  Enron 
has previously used for software escrow.  The company is called DSI 
Technology and they have different plans depending on our needs.  I briefly 
told DSI what we would probably need, and based on your need of having an 
agreement with a release condition whereby DSI would release the source code 
to Enron under certain conditions, it would have a cost of about $2,400 for 
the first year.  This would allow storage space for about 12 CD's.  All three 
parties:  DSI, Enron, and D-G Energy would have to sign such agreement.  
However, we would have to work out some special details on releasing the 
source code because normally DSI will only release if DSI gave them notice 
that they could release it or if certain conditions were met (such as D-G 
Energy went bankrupt).  

I did not send any of this information on to Ms. Geman - I want to see how 
she responds first.  However, I wanted to go ahead and let you know this 
since it is about $1,400 more than you had said you would be willing to pay.  
Do you have any input on this?

Thanks,
Karla

Dear Ms. Geman,

I met with Vince Kaminski yesterday regarding picking back up with the 
license agreement we were working on back in March.  He relayed some 
additional requirements which need to be added to the agreement, which 
include the following:

 1. The price agreed upon is $90,000.
 2. D-G will provide system support.
3. No later than 12 months of execution of the agreement, D-G will provide 
the source code to Enron.  In the meantime, the source code is to be in 
escrow.  Additionally, the source code would be released sooner than the 12 
months if any of the following conditions occur:  (i) D-G goes out of 
business; (ii) D-G is unable to provide effective technical support; or (iii) 
if D-G agrees to release it sooner.

Before I have our attorney add these things to the agreement, we need to 
discuss the escrow situation.  Vince mentioned that you had suggested that 
your attorney keep the software in escrow.   Is your attorney a U.S. 
attorney?  It seems like I may have recalled that way back in March you might 
have said you had a friend or relative that was an attorney.  Is that the 
same person?  Does this attorney work for a large firm, small firm, or solo 
practitioner?  Basically, if you could just provides some additional 
information about your attorney, I would appreciate it.

We normally would use an Escrow company to put the software in escrow.  We 
have dealt with a company here in the U.S. called DSI Technology.  I will 
check into that pending your answer regarding your attorney.

Once we decide what we want to do regarding placing the software in escrow, 
we will red-line the agreement to reflect such changes and e-mail it back to 
you for your review.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Vince,

Here is my edited version of the software license agreement.    Can you read it once before I forward it for internal approval?   I specified that the $100,000 covers a single  user  perpetural license,  access to source after one year,  and covers maintenance and support for one year.

Any suggestions?

I have Vince on the list now. We are installing this week and over next 
weekend. We'll have to go to the location to see if we'll have to pull 
additional cable to Vince's desk. I wouldn't look for it to be in before next 
Monday.

With regards to the billing -- I will have Stella Ely get with you on that.

Thank you for all of the info

Stinson,
?
Here are some options considering what you  have
said:
?
1)? We can do a full week of class from May 7 to  11.
?
2)? The second option is to split the  course over two weeks.
If you cannot possibly accomodate a full week of  training 
then we can try this.? We have done  this before and it has 
worked fairly well.? It would be like:
?
Week 1 (20 hours):? Feb 20-23, Tue-Fri,  12:00 to 5:00
Week 2 (20 hours):?  April 9-12, Mon-Thu, 12:00 to 5:00
?
These are the only two weeks that are available for Venkat  
to teach before May 7th date.? 
?
Please let me know if these would work.? I  look forward to 
hearing from you.?
?
Regards,
?

Hi Helyette,

Congratulations on your papers.

The purchase contract is in the last stage of approvals
(it's circulating through different parts of the company
where it has to be signed). I think we should be able to execute
the contract  in the first few days of December.

I shall let you know as soon as our internal process is completed.

Vince

Dear Vince,
I guess time has been flying for you by since our brilliant show
in Paris.In my case,it is the same:I got 3 papers accepted in THE
3 major Journals in Finance(Journal of Business,Journal of Finance
and Journal of Financial Economics).We should write a piece!
Our software seems to be quite satisfactory for the oil people.My
lawyer had added a paragraph to Karla's document:since she had
mentioned the right for Enron to check at any time the code source
etc,he wanted to request Enron to pay his fees in the case D-G
disappeared.In any case,if you are still interested,we are ready to
use your escrow account to make things simpler.Moreover,I am
striking an agreement with a software company ,13years with
people from Polytechnique+finance,to be our hot line(with us paying
royalties,of course).This would complement my 2 associates.
Looking forward to hearing from you
Helyette

Hi-

We have access to the SAS Online Tutorial for the next 30 days. Point your 
browser to 

http://www2.sas.com/onlinetutor_v8prod/welcome.htm

and use the username "enron" and password "enron" to enter.

The way this product works is designed for a single user (it sets a "cookie" 
allowing you to "resume" your place in the tutorial when you re-enter.) 

Since several of us may use it, we'll need to work around this, each of us 
remembering where we were before and recreating any sample data sets, etc 
necessary for the lesson in progress.

Clayton

PS The module EIS/OLAP will be a part of our installation next month, but is 
not currently available

PPS Please remember to use your local browser to browse the SAS Online 
Documentation. Invoking a browser on the Unix server is inefficient.

I gave you local admin rights on your laptop yesterday. What you have to do 
is to log into the laptop using the local
Machine account. The id and the password is the same as your Corp login now. 
The password on the local account will 
Never change. If you have a minute today I will show you how. Let me know a 
time.

Subject: Installation of new programs

Phillip,

How can I install new programs on my laptop, without 
the administrator's privileges?

One example: when I travel I use AOL to get access to my mail
and to communicate with the office. Windows 2000 does not allow 
me to install it.

 Also, I have my private statistical software
I often use when I work at night during business trips.
I would like to load it as well.

This weekend, the Enron Global Information Technologies department will be 
distributing a new version of the Oracle 8i client.  Due to the mobile 
environment of our user base, not all machines will receive the automatic 
update.  If you are a user of an Oracle based application and your machine is 
not available to the network this weekend, you can manually upgrade your 
machine via the following steps:  

 1) Click on Start - Programs - Utilities 
 2) Then  click on "Install Oracle 8i Client".


If you are a user of Microsoft Excel spreadsheets or Microsoft Access 
databases that retrieve information from our Oracle databases, you can 
manually convert your Oracle ODBC connections to the proper drivers via the 
following steps:  

 1) Click on Start - Programs - Utilities
 2) Then  click on "Update ODBC Data Source Names to Oracle 8i".


If you do not see these icons, there is another icon under Start - Programs - 
Utilities called "Update Start Menu" that will re-populate your Start Menu.


Thank you for your co-operation -
Scott Williamson

Vince,

Your note looks good to me, short and to the point.  

I assume this will prompt further detailed discussions with Dale.  I would 
want to clarify that we are primarily interested in the long term gas model 
AND database for North America.  Unless a familiarity with the short term 
model is a prerequisite, I doubt that we would want to spend a lot of time on 
it.

Depending upon how long it would take to become familiar with the long term 
model, it might be helpful to have access in both Omaha and Houston?

We would eventually need specifications for the computer system we would need 
for testing the model.  Steve Hotte, CIO for ETS, would co-ordinate the 
in-house installation for us.  At some point, it will be helpful to get Steve 
in contact with the appropriate MarketPoint IT rep.

Assuming that you get acceptable clarification of these issues, Dale should 
probably send to us a modified licensing agreement for review. 

Let me know what I should do next.

JNG

Scott,

Not at all. I left to make a quick call and it required a number
of follow-up calls. 

The presentation was very interesting and professional.

One of the guidelines we have in my group is to avoid using too many software 
packages.
Otherwise, everybody will have his own pet package and we shall lose 
economies of scale.

I shall talk to my associates about your product  and get back to you.

Vince

Hello Vince,

I'm writing to follow up with you regarding our meeting last week.  Did we
do something wrong in our presentation or in the set up of this presentation?

For a group of 50 researchers we were expecting a larger crowd and also
some peole perhaps from your IT department.  Also when you left I was
wondering if we had offended you.

The ability to use our products to create open models, integrate databases,
C, VB, etc. and then quickly deploy them to others has been embraced by
the risk management world.  We met the following day with a large group
from EES and they seemed quite enthusiastic about the innovation possible
with our tools.

I realize you are quite busy, but could you please let me know what
happened and how we can prevent this in the future?

Thanks
Scott Wakefield

Vince and Stinson,

I checked the file and the maintenance that automatically renews on 4/1/2000  
is for the following products:

All 4 of your @GLOBAL licenses
SPAV
SWING

I will go ahead and contact FEA and see about getting the renewal invoice for 
these.  I'll send it to Shirley for payment once I have it.


The products:  @INTEREST, SEAPC, and SEAPP have not been on maintenance for a 
while.  FEA told us a couple of years ago I believe that they do not have 
maintenance available for these products any longer.  So, you don't need to 
worry about cancelling @INTEREST.

Also, just FYI - your @ENERGY.1 and @ENERGY.2 licenses have maintenance 
through 10/20/2000.

If you have any questions, please let me know.  Otherwise, I will proceed 
with contacting FEA about you renewal of the @GLOBAL, SPAV, and SWING 
licenses.

Thanks,
Karla
