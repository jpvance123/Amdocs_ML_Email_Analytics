Thanks for the feedback.  I think this is right in line with CRM's proposal 
and will definitely meet our objective to control credit risks with higher 
risk counterparties.  It is an excellent Phase 1 solution which we certainly 
can try to address more systematically in future developments.

We have done some initial review of the current deal flow in Houston and 
London and don't expect this language to impact a high percentage of 
transactions.   Based on our review of recently executed Enron transactions 
we expect about 80% of total transactions will not be impacted by this 
language.  Most of our deal flow is with highly rated counterparties.  
However, as we build the Online Trading volume with more customers, we expect 
the majority of our customers will require this GTC language.

Following my earlier conversation with Mark Taylor I have revised the text,

Subject: Coal Changes in EnronOnline

Alan/Harry,

I can't remember which of you two lucky souls are looking after coal.

We have modified the Coal Products somewhat. 

Previously, we showed Product Types for US Coal Nymex Phy Fwd, US Coal 
PRB8400 Phy Fwd and US Coal PRB880 Phy Fwd.
We are in the process of replacing this with a single Product Type: US Coal 
Phy Fwd, which has various delivery locations. This is more of a logical 
change than anything else, and the long descriptions have been edited only 
slightly from what was there before. Please review the following and let us 
know if it meets your approval.

Thanks,

Dave

David, As long as the long descriptions have not changed and the traders are 
fine with the short description changes as being clearer, I have no problems 
with the changes on the financial side.  Stacy will respond on the physical

Please find attached a spreadsheet showing the new descriptions and some 
samples of the old descriptions (I have to match these by hand, so it is not 
a comprehensive list).

The changes are:

1) Re-ordering of the elements
2) Shortening the index/location description to something which is more 
recognizeable to the traders (and our customers)

We would like to be showing these short descriptions to customers on Monday, 
so your response/input is needed today.

Sorry about the short notice - we're all in the same boat on this one.

Attached are revised drafts of the New York PA and ETA, which have been 
revised to reflect the latest Clifford Chance drafts and our discussion 
yesterday.  We are unable to blackline these drafts, due to the fact that the 
Clifford Chance drafts are not on our system (and we did not receive all of 
them in any event).  Also, we have not yet received from Mark's office the 
language on confirmations; we have taken a shot at it but can obviously 
modify it after we get the language.

Finally, we have attached a blackline of the "Legal and Privacy" statement, 
reflecting some suggested changes.  We also note that, if this document is to 
be "global", we will either need to decide on a single governing law or 
delete choice of law entirely.

Best regards.

long descriptions for benzene, mixed xylene, toluene and methanol.   We have 
also finalized the form of GTC's for EPC (who trades benzene, xylene and

Louise,

Thank you for the below email.  It is good to clear up the confusion
regarding this process.  At the end of the email you ask for our comments on
the ROETA execution process.

We would prefer that the ROETA be executed off-line.  It is on that basis
that we have sought the opinion of overseas counsel.  That said, you may
form the view that online execution of the ROETA is no different to the
operation of a website with a hotlinked disclaimer.  On that basis you may
decide to execute the ROETA online.  We have some concerns regarding
security issues because of the distribution of a password without a
supporting agreement, however, you may form the view that this is a minor
risk.

If you have any other questions, please do not hesitate contact me.

Regards

Timothy Hughes

Subject: GTCs Related Issues

Clifford Chance prepared a first draft of GTCs for UK traded commodities. 
There are couple general issues emerged from our discussion today that are 
relevant to all commodities:

1. Drafted GTC state that "the transaction shall be deemed executed at the 
time that Enron sends electronic  message of acceptance" later referred as 
Electronic Confirmation to the counterparty and "the parties may also 
complete a written confirmation". "But in the event of any conflict Enron's 
electronic records or paper copies" of them  shall prevail. 

The question (David? Louise?)  is whether it makes sense to continue sending 
written confirmations in this case? I know that the current business 
processes assume that deals done Online, after they hit the Books, are 
processed in the exactly same manner as deals done over the phone. However, 
in case of the online trades when one paper record already exists, additional 
written confirmation may be redundant.(?)

2. As it was decided not to modify Masters on a client by client basis, the 
text on the screen asking to accept GTCs as well as electronically generated 
Confirmation text should say that  the customer accepts that this transaction 
is governed by GTC (available onlie) unless there is a Master Agreement in 
place.

regards,
ek

Gentlemen:

In connection with an analysis of the tax issues presented by the E-commerce 
program, it is important that all Enron entities to participate in such 
system (as well the products to be traded by such entities) be compiled.  
London has undertaken this with respect to Europe (and, shortly, Singapore).  
I have undertaken to coordinate this with respect to North America.  Thus, if 
you could send me a list of North American Enron entities to be incorporated 
in the E-commerce program (and the products they will trade) I can then 
undertake to determine what issues such presents.  In this regard, I will 
coordinate with ECT-Legal in North America to verify that the manner such 
entities are to be incorporated into the E-commerce program does not trigger 
unplanned for tax consequences.

In addition, it would be helpful to obtain copies of the form of agreements 
to be entered into by counterparties prior to such parties being granted 
access to the E-commerce system (i.e., the form of on-line access agreements 
and any agreements ancilliary thereto).  These agreements are important to 
the tax analysis of the E-commerce program because the manner such agreements 
are to be entered into may implicate tax nexus concerns that we will want to 
work to mitigate (for example, if it is contemplated that all such on-line 
agreements are to be administratively executed by a single entity 
("Administrative Entity") on behalf of each Enron trading entity 
participating in the E-commerce system, such process could expose the Enron 
trading entity to tax exposure in the jurisdiction in which the 
Administrative Entity is located - obviously, this may be more complicated if 
it is uncertain where such Administrative Entity is located).

Finally, it is understood that the manner in which trading is to be effected 
through the E-commerce system is such that the Enron trading entity 
established as the entity to trade with a particular counterparty will be the 
only such Enron entity transacting business with such counterparty.  In this 
regard, therefore, it is not contemplated that one Enron trading entity will 
transact in part with a counterparty and that another Enron trading entity 
will complete such trade (for example, it will not be possible for a 
counterparty to obtain an agreement with respect to a particular product with 
EEL that will then be supplied by ECT - though this may occur on occasion in 
a fashion no different that is currently the case).  Please notify me in the 
event that this understanding is not correct so that we can plan to mitigate 
the potential tax issues that will be raised if trading is to occur otherwise 
(in this regard, as was discussed on Tuesday with Dave Mally and David Port, 
if a trade is transacted in a manner whereby one Enron entity executes a 
transaction and fulfills the requirements of such by purchasing inventory 
from another Enron entity, the income derived in such transaction is 
potentially subject to taxation in multiple tax jurisdictions).

Please contact either myself at x30938 or, if I am unavailable, Jeff 
Blumenthal at x35777 in Houston with any follow-up questions.  Best regards.

No rest for the wicked, huh?

I'd offer to take you out for that drink tonight, but I need to pick up Avril

Hope you got to enjoy at least some of your weekend. . .

I have not received any comments.  I consider it final.  Let me know if you 
need to have it customized for any particular circumstance.  Since I don't 
know who (or for that matter what) the PCG heads are, I sugggest that if they 
need it you send them copies.

Subject: Draft EOL Termination Letter

Here's a draft of a termination letter.  I'd be happy to see what everyone 
thinks before we use it.  For instance, what tone are we aiming for?  If we 
want to be all legal and hard-nosed, I can throw in ETA section references, 
etc. or if we want to be softer we can emphasize other trading opportunities 
within Enron and possibly explain our reasons for the termination.

Let me know what you think.

Mark, the following tax changes to the various financial GTC's and weather 
swaps are those that we have spoken about and effectively adopt the approach 
of our Master ISDA's with regard to taxation.  Just wanted to keep you in the 
loop.  I will be out on Tuesday but, should you need to, you can follow up 
with Jeff Blumenthal.  Best regards.

Subject: Revised GTCs

Dave,

Attached below are the OnLine GTCs that contain the appropriate U.S. federal 
tax language.  As you'll see, our changes are reflected either by underline 
or strikeout in each of the documents.  The 3 attachments below are as 
follows:

  1.  ENA financial GTC
  2.  Enron Canada financial GTC
  3.  ENA HDD swap GTC

As you know, ENA financial (credit) and Enron Canada financial (credit) GTCs 
exist in addition to the ENA financial and Enron Canada financial GTCs.  The 
language that we inserted in the attached ENA financial and Enron Canada 
financial GTCs should also be inserted in the ENA financial (credit) and 
Enron Canada financial (credit) GTCs.  In addition, there are several weather 
derivative swap GTCs.  The language set forth in the attached ENA HDD swap 
GTC will need to be inserted in all other ENA weather derivative swap GTCs 
(credit and non-credit).

Also, please note that the message you forwarded to me from Leslie Hansen 
appears to relate to the U.S. state tax language to be inserted into certain 
GTCs.

Please call me at 3-5777 if you'd like to discuss further.

Best regards,

Jeff

Per our (separate) discussions, I have revised the GTCs to reflect (i) the
counterparty's representation that it is a domestic corporation (which, if
correct, would permit us to avoid back-up withholding on reportable
payments, if any, made pursuant to this GTC) and (ii) the requirement that
we provide the relevant forms to the counterparty in the event the
counterparty notifies us that it is not a domestic corporation.

Alan

Rather than give you evolving advice, I would prefer to wait until both our
regulatory and tax reviews are complete, but pending those:

Re reference to "commodity" - you are correct - if another word can be found 
it
might be better to avoid the word 'commodity' if the letter (or brochure) is 
to
be translated into Japanese since the translator may chose the same word as 
the
offending Japanese word in the law.

Re the reference to adding products "local to Japan" - this is getting very
close to the prohibition on dealing in products for which a "market" exists in
Japan and I would prefer to leave it out at least until we finish our 
regulatory
review.

Re the address to which applications are to be sent, pending our reviews this
should also be outside Japan.

Regards

Paul

Louise,

Thanks for your voicemail, which I picked up late last night at home. I'll 
try to call you on your mobile later today, but I'll be leaving the office 
early today on a business trip. In case I miss you, I wanted to get back to 
you in this notesmail (I understand you're picking up email in Houston). I've 
left Justin a voicemail on this as well.

I think your proposal for legal staffing sounds great. I think using Clifford 
Chance as project manager is a good idea and will speed up the process. My 
only suggestion is that  we use our normal outside Continental counsel for 
both the internet issues and the trading/commodity issues, as opposed to 
using CC's Continental offices for internet issues and our normal outside 
Continental counsel for the trading/commodity issues. (Of course, we'd use CC 
London for the UK internet issues.) Let me tell you why I think this will 
work better. 

First, CC doesn't have local offices in all the jurisdictions we're looking 
at, so we'll need to use our normal outside counsel in several of the 
jurisdictions for both areas in any event.

Second, I think there's less chance of something falling through a crack if 
we use the same firm for both areas in each country.

Third, I think it will be easier for us and CC to manage the process on the 
Continent if we're only dealing with one firm. 

Fourth, we selected CC because they have a strong IT practice in London. In 
my experience, the quality of their Continental offices is very uneven and 
they probably don't even have IT lawyers in several of those offices. Because 
we use  one of the largest commercial law firms in each Continental 
jurisdiction, I think we're more likely to get cutting edge IT advice from 
our normal outside counsel than from CC's local offices. In my mind, this is 
probably the most important reason for taking this approach.

Let me know if you have any different thoughts on this. Thanks!

In response to your note with respect to the above-referenced topic, I agree 
that the GTC should be attached to the confirm as it mirrors our normal 
practice.  However, the confirm itself should not give a period of time for 
objection as these transactions will be agreed to instantaneously.  Also, I 
would be in favor of the GTC being sent with North American power GTC's and I 
understand that is what Kim is intending to do.  As far as the other 
commodities,  I leave those decisions to Mark Taylor,  Alan Aronowitz and 
whoever else needs to be consulted.

Subject: Legal & Privacy Statement



 <<Legal and Privacy.doc>>  <<Legal and Privacy.rtf>>

Further to our conference call yesterday, please find attached a revised
draft of the Legal and Privacy statement with a further copy marked up to
show the changes from the previous draft.

I have changed the trade mark wording in the first clause.  This should be
sufficient wording to identify third party trade marks used on the website
provided that you are only using those third party trade marks in order to
identify third party products and, of course, are not using them in order to
trade.

In Clause 2, I have stated that the ETA and other general terms and
conditions are available by writing to your head of legal.  As I have
mentioned before, my preference would be for the ETA to be available to a
counterparty at the time of signing the Password Application.  This would
help to avoid any potential argument by a counterparty that the terms of the
ETA have not been incorporated by reference at the time of signing the
Password Application because the counterparty did not know what it was
signing.  Nonetheless, I understand that you do not wish to do this and will
rely upon the counterparty printing off the ETA prior to clicking its
acceptance to it on the website.

Do you want the counterparties to also be able to get copies of the General
Terms and Conditions by writing to you or should this just be restricted to
the ETA?

Finally, I have incorporated changes into the disclaimer to avoid the need
for the Read Only ETA.  However, it will be important to ensure that when
allocating passwords on a read only basis, it is made clear to the
counterparty that they cannot trade on the website and that you are entitled
to terminate their access at any time immediately with or without notice.
Clearly, the read only access must allow the counterparty to open and read
the Legal and Privacy statement.

I look forward to receiving your comments on this.

Kind regards

Andrew Wilkinson

Pursuant to our discussion this morning.  We are trying to ensure that there 
is a coordinated effort by legal, global and credit to ensure we have the 
correct contracts in this matrix.  We can simply copy this matrix for the 
masters.   I will be in London tomorrow and call you to ensure you hve 
everything you need from us.

Subject: 

Attached is the latest version of the counterparty/product type matrix.  The 
matrix consist of four colour coded counterparty sections.

Section 1 (white) is the fully approved list from credit with limits noted. 
Section 2 (green) is a second approved list from credit which does not have 
limits noted, yet (credit work in progress). 
Section 3 (blue) consist of counterparties included in the external marketing 
company mailshot, but have not been reviewed by credit, legal, or tax. 
Section 4 (orange) includes counterparties received from the originators & 
marketers that will be manually mailed on Sept 13, but have not yet been 
reviewed by credit, legal, or tax.

The product types at the top (row 10) of the matrix have been updated also to 
the "final" upload version.  Some product types have been deleted and some 
have been added.  The product types that have been added are highlighted in 
yellow.

All of the counterparties on this matrix will be mailed a brochure on 
September 13.  (High credit risk counterparties from section 4 will be pulled 
if we receive notice immediately)  This should be the final pre-launch 
counterparty matrix and will serve as the goal for pre approved 
authorisation.  The counterparty system upload will occur within the next few 
days.  Any approvals/adjustments  received after this upload will require 
manual entries through the GUI by product control.

We understand that this has been a long process with many changes.  This 
matrix has been refined since the initial distribution to Tax, Credit and 
Legal on July 30, 1999.  I apologize for the tough task.

The goal now is to obtain sign off on this pre launch matrix ASAP: 

Credit should provide the limits for Section 2, review Sections 3 & 4 to 
ensure adherence to the Enron Credit Policy  and work closely with Legal and 
Global on providing a Master Agreement matrix

Tax should review the additions to the matrix to ensure that the profile does 
not breach any tax laws or create a tax exposure and work with Global resolve 
the issue of country of incorporation

Legal should fill in the matrix to ensure that there are no legal or 
regulatory impediments to trade and work closely with Legal and Global on 
providing a Master agreement matrix

I will be co-ordinating with Jeff Hodge (US Legal); Justin Boyd (UK Legal); 
Debbie Brackett (Global Credit); Janine Juggins (UK Tax); Connie Sutton 
(Global)  and Stephen Douglas (US Tax) tomorrow to see what it will take to 
finish this task off.  Please call me with any questions at X30397. 

Thank you for the work you have done to date and for all that is yet to be 
completed.

Bob

I have talked to Aquilla on several occasions (including today) and they 
continue to say they are capable of playing by the rules.  I will talk to 
them again tomorrow and suggest that we shut off their capability to trade 
physical gas online (and vica versa for Aquila Energy Marketing).  They have 
asked us not to do this however I believe it may be time to revisit this.  We 
do have the legal ability to hold them to their click deals however they do 
not have the contracts to manage physical gas. This would obviously make a 
messy situation.  I suggest that you call Jennifer Denny, Torrey Moorer or 
myself as soon as you see one of these transactions in the future as we can 
check into it immediately.  

All transactions that have occured will be assigned by Aquila to Aquila.  
Mark Taylor will draft the agreements and Aquila has agreed to this.

Subject: Aquila

We need to know what the resolution plan is to getting Aquilia straight for 
trading Physical and Financial products.   Today we saw Aquilia Risk trade 
Next Day Physical Gas again and we were asked to move the deal to Aquilia 
Energy.  What is being done to get Aquilia Risk from continuing to enter 
Physical trades on line?  My concern for this trade was that we brought it to 
Credit's attention this morning and did not get final word to move the deal 
to Aquilia Energy until late in the day (4.45pm) which affects Logistics 
ability to nominate for next day business.  Logistics has been made aware of 
the late nom and will be working with the Pipe to get the nom in.  If there 
are issues with this late nom from the pipeline we will let you know.

I'm not comfortable with the internal process of  counterparty name changing 
of EOL deals and would like to get comfortable with how we are going to set 
this process up.  I think there should be legal review of all deals that we 
change and would suspect that some form of communication would need to be 
conveyed to the counterparty.

Mark,
Thank you for you phonecall and getting back to me so quickly.  This e-mail
is to confirm that you will be providing CXY with a letter that clarifies a
few issues that were we were uncomfortable with in the Electronic Trading
Agreement for Enron Online.  We would like clarification that the Master
Agreement already entered into between the parties will govern all aspects
of any physical trades made online, including those respecting transaction
procedures.  Particularly, we would ask that you acknowledge that Enron
shall continue to send confirmations for each and every Transaction.

Although we understand that the key password holder has the ability to
cancel passwords, we would like the ability, over and above that, as a
company, to be able to notify you and have you cancel passwords or to
terminate the online trading agreement completely.  As it is drafted, only
Enron has the ability to terminate.

As we do not yet have the ability to use electronic signatures, notices must
be sent as set out in the Master Agreement or the ISDA, (which we appear to
be close to signing).

Thank you again for your assistance with these issues and we look forward to
receiving your letter. The traders are now happy.

Susan Schulli

Dear all,

these are the issues from the last legal meeting that need further attention:

1). European Jurisdictions Peculiarities 
Slovenia, Cpoatia, Romania must be added to Phase 1 reviews. Products that  
considered are gas and power both physical and financial. 15 Jurisdictions 
reviews are already received. So far they do not reveal any fundamental 
problems with the overall structure. There are few recommendations on the 
wording of PAA, ETA and GTC to come. CC (Tim Hueges) is summarising all the 
replies and will forward a list of problematic issues for each jurisdictions 
by Monday (14th) lunch time. 

Possible complications are:

 All documents for French and Spanish customers may need translation into 
French and Spanish, as part of these  jurisdictions requirements.

 Sweden and Italy have particularly strict regulations on checking  validity 
of signatures => it may need to be reflected in the business processes.

It was suggested to have PAA on the screen as well, so that potential 
customers may print them out, fill in and mail to Enron.

2). Read Only Access for some customers
instead of ETA read only customers have to click on Read Only Agreement, 
therefor it has to be drafted ASAP.

3). Product Descriptions
A decision was made that they will be reviewed by internal legal team (Justin 
Boyd, Mark Taylor) but not CC or S&C.

4). Timetable 
GTCs in English should be finalised by the end of June.  First two weeks of 
July CC will spend validating marketing data.  Project timetable was promised 
to CC to be e-mailed yesterday.

5). Translation
Translation of GTCs, ETA and PPA will be done internally . The first priority 
languages most likely will be French, German and Spanish. 
Actions:

Translations of those GTCs that we already have must be started ASAP (Justin 
Boyd to co-ordinate).

Identify languages to  translate into (Elena Kapralova to co-ordinate with 
Justin and traders)

6). Taxes
Questionnaires similar to the one that was sent to European jurisdictions 
must be sent to Canada (Janine Juggins to co-ordinate).

7). Web Page Wording
The words "I accept" and "Delete" in the box that appears after a customer 
clicked on price, are to be changed into "Submit" and "Clear". Lawyers are 
comfortable with this.

8). Different Entities on Counterparty Side
If there are a few different entities trading for the same company,  for ex. 
Morgan Stanley International (MSI) and Morgan Stanley (MS), they should be 
treated in the system as two separate clients and be granted two separate 
System Administrator passwords. This is necessary for tax considerations. It 
is confirmed once again that there will be one ETA acceptance click per 
System Administrator.

9). Authorisation Risk 
Because Online Trading will be Enron's software, all problems arising from 
authorisation errors, for ex.  when customer that was supposedly authorised 
to trade only UK Gas was able to trade power, will be entirely Enron's 
liability => it highlights again an importance of very thorough testing of 
authorisation functionality of the system in July and August.

10). Written and Electronic Confirmations
It appears to be a difference between UK and US practices in treating 
superiority of written vs. electronic confirmations. According to the UK law, 
an electronic confirmation will overwrite a paper one, generated and mailed 
by the Back Office, similar to the current practice for transactions done 
over the telephone, when phone conversation overwrites all paper 
conformations. In the US the situation is opposite. For the deals done over 
the phone, written confirmations still take priority over the phone 
conversation tape. In Texas anything that is not in writing, is not 
enforceable.

The situation with priority of confirmations of Online trades in US must be 
investigated further (Mark Taylor to co-ordinate). The result should be 
reflected in US version of  ETA. 

This leads to a further question, whether sending written confirmations in UK 
is still necessary?

11). UN E-Commerce Directive
There is a daft of UN Directive on e-commerce, which currently has very 
strict rules regarding time when transaction is considered complete. It 
requires mutual exchange of written confirmations etc. Enron might be in 
position to lobby few items in this Directive (Justin and Regulatory Dept.) 

12). Suspending Trades by Counterparty
A few traders are very keen on being able to suspend trades by counterparty, 
for instance in a situation when they see a counterparty making a number of 
deals in the same commodity. It arises two issues:
IT -  the system should be able to put a name of the counterparty on the 
transaction summary page (bottom of the price page) 

Legal - CC has to investigate and give a view whether it is permitted by law.


Price Check Idea 
Just a thought, whether  it is technically possible to amend a price check 
(the one done when the customer submitted a price, and database does credit, 
GTC and price check) in a way that customer is notified about the price 
change not for all changes but only when the price has moved against Enron, 
i.e. if price moved in Enron's  favour transaction should go forward at the 
price customer had agreed to earlier. Legally it is OK. Jay, can the system 
do it? 

Internal Issues still to be addressed:

1). Global Liquids Books management, i.e. how responsibilities for price 
update will be managed  between London and Houston desks.
2). FX conversion including IT, business processes, tax, risk managment 
issues (David Port, Janine Juggins, Jay Webb)

All comments are welcome,
Regards,
Elena

Mark,

I notice that we have GTC's for EGLI Liquids(without collateral) and ELFI 
Crude-Products-Petchems (without collateral), but we do not have GTC's for 
EGLI Liquids (with collateral) or ELFI Crude-Products-Petchems (with 
collateral).   Is this correct? 

Please let me know your thoughts.

Thanks!

Dave,

Here are all the Online docs in both Word and HTML format!  We have not been 
able to put the PAs for Italy, Poland, Romania and Spain onto one page; we 
also had problems the with table in the US Coal GTC.  I suggest that someone 
with Web text editing expertise has a go at them.

I've included the new Canadian Gas GTCs (NIT Gas and Canada Gas) and the 
replacement US Coal GTC. But not, the power GTCs sent over earlier or the 
other US Gas GTCs.  I'm awaiting instruction in accordance with my earlier 
emails.

Thanks Edmund.

Good morning

I spoke to our lawyer yesterday on how we could possibly help you in the work 
we had done to date.  To be honest the majority of the effort is on the 
European side (due to the multi jurisdictional issues) and we haven't really 
done a lot in the US particularly on a state level.  

Perhaps the most appropriate thing would be for you to give Mark Taylor in 
ECT legal a ring to discuss the work we have done and see if there is 
anything you can get to save duplication.

Louise

I have reviewed the MasterProductData Spreadsheet (MPS - the version held by 
Mark Taylor) against the Enron North America Corp. Spot GTC for natural gas.

Many of the defined terms on the GTC are not referenced or (in some cases) 
not quantified by the MPS.

This could obvously give rise to confusion and possibly disputes with 
customers, revolving around central commercial terms.

I have prepared two emails - one for Andy/Elena/Mark, who are responsible for 
the MPS and one for Stacy, who I understand is responsible for the legal 
review of the MPS and the GTC. Each email contains more detailed comments and 
will be sent to you shortly.

I would appreciate it if responses could be incorporated into the MPS by 
Wednesday, Sept. 1 at the latest.

Note that wherever possible, I have suggested amendments which preserve the 
logical structure of the MPS, so as to minimize any delay to the project 
which these changes could cause.

For the next week, I will be available in Houston at 31861, or international 
cell at 011 44 7867 550 598.

Thanks,

Dave

Mark:

Apparently our people are already working with Louise Kitchen.  The issue I 
described yesterday is described below.  Basically we want to make reference 
to Enron Online in an informational site we will possibly be participating in 
Colombia.  Please let me know if you see any problem with this.

Thank you.

Subject: Re: Web side for Colombia  

I talked to Louise Kitchen (MD Enrononline) about how our group could  
leverage on  enrononline for  our plans of a first step with an informational 
site in Colombia  to move  later to a transactional site as Enron stars  
trading activities in Colombia.

What I proposed to Louise is to  get  ISA to include enrononline in the 
"other sites of interest" data  for  Colombia and to also have enrononline to 
include data on Colombia in the enrononline informational site .  She says 
that it is very easy to include this information  and that in principle she 
doesn't  think there is a problem in linking enrononline to ISA if it is 
going to be only for the informational site.  

She referred me to Rahil Jafry (content) to discuss the process to make the 
Colombia information to be included in the site. I talked to him and we 
scheduled a meeting for Friday at 8:30AM.

Please confirm ASAP if you will be available for this meeting

Thanks, Maria Elena

You are correct - it only affects the booking of the deal.

Subject: Re: Cutoff Time for EOL Gas Transactions  

Does this affect only the "booking" of the transactions?  That is, from the 
contract point of view the trade is still done today, and should be dated the 
dy the trade was done, even though we may not get it into the bood until the 
following day.  Sort of an internal vs. external issue.

Subject: Cutoff Time for EOL Gas Transactions

I talked to each of you a couple of weeks ago, and this topic got pushed 
aside due to some other pressing issues.  However, each of you agreed that a 
standard cutoff time was acceptable for US gas, power and liquids products.  

The best option will be to agree to cutoff at 4pm each day (just to get an 
idea of the numbers we were talking about, I looked at yesterday to determine 
how many deals were traded after 4pm Houston time.  We had three US Gas 
deals, and two Canadian Gas deals).  After 4pm, the bridges would 
automatically roll new EOL deals to the next day.  However, for those deals 
that do not bridge after 4pm, the various risk groups would need to remember 
that these deals are the following day's business.  I am not sure how the 
procedures in Risk would need to be modified for the trader's position 
reports, as the official books would not include these late deals.  Can Risk 
run supplemental reports to ensure that the desks have accurate positions 
each morning?   

I would appreciate any comments that you may have, and regardless, please 
re-confirm that a cutoff of 4pm works for each of your respective groups.

Here is a summary of various conversations over the last couple of days 
between the recipients of this email and what I believe has now been agreed. 
If I have missed anything, please let me know.

- Frank Davis (PCG) will issue a PA report on a daily basis, which will 
highlight new PA's which have been received.
- Debbie Brackett (Credit) will review the list, ensure that the correct 
corporate entity is identified and fill out the credit profile.
- Credit will generate a profile matrix, which they will send to:
 - Each of the existing legal contacts, with cc: Tana Jones
 - Global Contracts (Karen Lambert)
 - Global Counterparty (Samuel Schott)
- Tana, Karen and Samuel will be responsible for collecting the feedback from 
within their respective departments and forwarding to Frank Davis
- Frank will collate the three inputs, produce a master profile and update 
Tax.

The above procedure shall still be completed within 72 hours.

Subject: Business process language

1. On line payee tax representation issues

The final generic payee tax representation language is being sent through by 
Slaughter & May (tonight) and will be incorporated into the Generic Financial 
GTC. 

As we discussed earlier the approach taken will require two additional fields 
in our Financial Confirmations. Since we are continuing to prepare these 
written Financial confirmations the normal back office procedures will apply 
to their issuance, and thus this requirement should not have any direct 
impact on the on line systems. It does however introduce a requirement to 
make a change to the confirmation templates which needs to be in place ready 
for the first on line transactions in September. I believe there are 
different templates in use for the different Financial businesses.

I suggest that the two new fields required in the Financial Confirmations are 
included under the section outlining the general terms of the swap.These will 
take the form of:

Counterparty Payor Jurisdiction: <<Insert country of incorporation of the 
Counterparty>>

Counterparty Payee Jurisdiction(s): 1. <<Insert country in which the trading 
office through which the Counterparty transacts is located>>
          2. <<If different to 1, insert country in which the office through 
which the Counterparty will make payment is located>>

Once new customers are established (and also for existing customer base - 
would this be a good way of approaching dealing with the existing customer 
base with the aim of eliminating Annex A which are different only because of 
the tax reps ?) perhaps a good way of maintaining this data would be to set 
it up on a spreadsheet [or the counterparty database ?] [direct link from the 
New Customer Registration Form]. Thus the decision on which countries to 
insert would only need to be made once on setting up a new counterparty. For 
example the spreadsheet could look like this:

Counterparty Description   Counterparty Payor Jurisdiction  Counterparty 
Payee Jurisdiction 1     Counterparty Payee Juris 2

Morgan Stanley Singapore Pte Ltd  Singapore    Singapore   
Morgan Stanley London branch   US     UK
Morgan Stanley Paris branch   US     France

There will also need to be a clear statement on the Financial Confirmation 
that it is the Counterparty's responsibility to notify Enron where the 
Counterparty Payor or Payee Jurisdiction information is incorrect. This is 
particularly important for the tax representations as Enron is using its 
judgement to identify the relevant countries but this may not always be 
correct (sometimes the place of management of the business is the relevant 
factor and Enron is not in a position to know this). This actually is no 
different to the situation we have today when it is Enron which determines 
which variety of the Annex A gets sent out.

2. New Customer Registration Form

a) Please add an additional question under Legal Information required:

Country from which payment is to be made if different:    
_____________________

b) The following has not yet been agreed by Steve Douglas but I wanted to 
raise the subject to get comments on the issue of European counterparties 
trading financials directly with US Enron entities.

Statement to be added under the heading of Tax Information Required (US new 
customer registration form only):

 Please submit to [ECTRC] IRS Form W9 and IRS Form 1001, or IRS Form W8 and 
IRS Form 4224 (as applicable), indicating the authority under which payments 
to be made to you are not subject to US Federal Income Tax withholding.

Since this statement is not required for ECTRI European counterparties this 
leads to a New Counterparty Registration Form for US counterparties and a 
separate New Counterparty Registration Form for European counterparties - is 
this an issue ? 

Also is it the intention to give to European counterparties the ability to 
trade financial products which would be contracted for by US Enron entities 
eg Pulp Financials and Plastics etc - in this case, it would make commercial 
sense to send the European counterparty the correct IRS Forms in order to 
eliminate this as an obstacle to the registration process [I have also asked 
Edmund to confirm whether we would want to avoid European counterparties 
contracting financials directly with US Enron entities for European financial 
regulatory reasons].

3. Business Process

You asked for some language to include in the Business Process to describe 
this procedure. Here's my suggestion:

" Tax Representations 
The responses to the 3 Legal Information Requirements set out on the New 
Customer Registration Form [will link directly to the Counterparty Payor 
Jurisdiction and the Counterparty Payee Jurisdiction fields on the relevant 
Financial confirmation] or [should be entered into the counterparty database] 
or [should be entered into the spreadsheet for maintaing tax representation 
data]. The response to question 1 is the Counterparty Payor Jurisdiction, the 
responses to questions 2 and 3 (if any) are the Counterparty Payee 
Jurisdiction(s).

Tax Department should review the New Customer Registration forms periodically 
[frequency ? daily ? weekly ? currently we do this every time a new 
counterparty is set up, but we do not want to introduce unnecessary delays to 
the registration process when there is a window of time to make an adjustment 
to the database/other medium feeding into the confirms before the first trade 
has been done] to identify obvious inconsistencies in the responses [the onus 
is on the customer to identify errors, but we should probably act in good 
faith in assisting to identify obvious errors]."

Sorry this is so long

Regards
Janine

As far as your email questions, my responses are following:

1.  The list I have provided you is the only list that exists on financial 
counterparties.  There is no Excel spreadsheet to follow.
2.  Duke Energy Corporation.  At Mark's direction, I am sending his note 
below regarding utilities.  Again, until we do the due diligence on a utility 
counterparty we have no way of knowing what kind of local, state or federal 
regulation or approvals they may be subject to.   We currently have masters 
in place with only about 10 utilities/govt's.  We are in the process of 
negotiating another 30.  Until those masters are executed and we have the 
relevant resolutions, authority documents and/or legal opinions, I cannot 
approve them for online trading.  I have made every effort to search company 
websites and elicit from Credit whether a counterparty is a regulated utility 
or not.  If I cannot tell by the information available to me, additional due 
diligence will be needed to see if they are subject to local, state, or 
federal regulation.   Mark can override any decision I have made, I can only 
make decisions within the guidelines the attorneys have set for me.
3.  Montana Power Trading and Marketing Company is a subsidiary of a 
regulated utility.  I am unable to determine from Credit or their website 
what type of regulation they might be subject to.  The note is true that 
Credit says they are getting out of the business anyway.
4.  Petrotemex.   Per my conversations with Mark and our advice from counsel, 
unlike U.S. and U.K. counterparties, Mexican counterparties are not able to 
enter into derivative transactions unless their articles and bylaws 
specifically provide for these types of transactions.  We will not know this 
until the due diligence is completed, so I am supposed to say "no" for 
Mexican counterparties we do not have a master swap agreement in place with.
5.  PSEG. It is an energy services company; however, it is also not an 
eligible swap participant (or "ESP").  CFTC regulation limits the derivatives 
trading we may do to certain types of counterparties that meet certain 
financial requirements (large, institutional type investors, companies, 
banks, etc).  Corporations and partnerships have to meet certain net worth 
and asset levels or we cannot trade financially with them.  Whenever I say 
"not ESP" or "not eligible swap participant" it means they have not met the 
financial net worth test.
6.  The American Coal Company.  See prior note.

Does this mean that we have 10 utilities that are approved to trade?  What 
are we doing with the other 30-40?

Subject: Online Derivatives Trading with Regulated Utilities  

We have not decided "to prevent any regulated utility from completing any 
financial transactions" online.  If we have already satisfactorily concluded 
the necessary due diligence with respect to a particular utility, they will 
be approved.  It is only with respect to those utilities which have not yet 
been researched that we are withholding approval.  The due diligence required 
involves asking the utility for certain information concerning their 
organization and regulatory situation, hiring local counsel in the relevant 
state and having research done into the laws and regulations in place there 
and into any public utility commission orders respecting the particular 
utility in question, and on occasion requesting an opinion letter from the 
utility's counsel.  We usually begin that process only when a trader believes 
there is a likelihood of a sufficient volume of trading with the utility to 
justify the time and expense.  FYI, the due diligence process has in the past 
revealed circumstances which prevented the utility from trading derivatives 
or required actions to authorize such trading which had not been taken.

A recent count showed about 10 executed master agreements and another 30 to 
40 in one stage or another of the due diligence/negotiation process.

On Friday we will be receiving the remaining customer list from credit, due

Any problems with this please notify me immediately as we are now running up 
against very tight deadlines in terms of getting all of the information in 
the system for the launch schedule.

Thanks

Mark,
On another note we are requesting a review of the blanket decision which has 
been made to prevent any regulated utility from completing any financial 
transactions, if we are not prepared to do the due diligence on which ones 
can transact and which ones can not - is this our responsibility or theirs?  
ie their decision whether to trade or not.

Scott,

We have decided to alter the way in which we register people

We have decided to send out passwords to all counterparties this summer which 
are Read Only and only when they return the PA signed do we alter the status 
of  their password to execution status (subject to eveyone being happy with 
this).

I would like to question the usefulness of the ROETA - why exactly do we need 
it - I don't seem to be able to figure it out - I propose we get rid of it.

If the PA and ETA are still structured as they were when I last saw them, the 
PA (which will be manually signed) binds the counterparty to the ETA and the 
ETA says that transactions will be governed by a master agreement, if any, or 
GTCs, if no master.  Assuming that is still the case, it seems to me that a 
letter sent to the counterparty, but not signed by it, will likely not 
override the PA and ETA already agreed to.  This seems particularly 
problematic if the reason for trying to override the ETA is to take advantage 
of better credit terms in the GTCs.  It seems to me that we would be better 
off either changing the ETA or supplementing it on-line; that way, we would 
at least have a click agreement, which the counterparty has agreed to be 
bound by.  Perhaps we should discuss further.  Thanks.

>>> "Mark Taylor" <mtaylo1@ect.enron.com> 10/21 11:34 AM >>>


This issue comes up when the Credit Group is not happy with the credit
provisions built into the already executed Master Agreement - they want the
ability to use the GTC with the credit provisions that allow us to call for a
letter of credit whenever we want to instead of having the online trade 
governed
by the master (as provided for automatically in the ETA).  What do you think
about Edmund's solution?

Subject:  Online Trading - GTC/Master variation

Dear Jeff and Mark,

Justin and I have been discussing the way we should approach variation of the
ETA in respect of counterparties with whom we have an existing master 
agreement,
but for whom we want to have transactions governed by the applicable GTC for 
the
product in question.

The initial plan was to issue a letter to the counterparty asking it to sign 
and
return a letter agreement which would vary the provision of ETA which states
that a master agreement will govern all transactions.  We have now 
reformulated
our position and drafted a letter (attached below) which will simply be sent 
to
the relevant counterparty, but which will not require it to sign and return 
any
documents.

We believe that this letter will provide for an effective variation of the ETA
by stating that the counterparty's acceptance of the GTC on the EOL system 
will
mean that that GTC will govern transactions, and not the master agreement.  We
do not think that we need to make an explicit reference to the ETA.  Obviously
for this to work, such counterparty will have to be presented with the 'Accept
GTC' button at the usual juncture in the system.

In addition, we thought it best to remove an explantory paragraph stating that
we will be writing to the counterparty at a future date to revise the credit
provisions of the master (the whole reason for having the counterparty accept
the GTC over the master!!).

Obviously we welcome your thoughts on this issue and the attached draft.  I 
also
presume you will need to take a view as to whether varying the ETA in this way
will be effective under New York law.

Best regards,

Edmund.

Dear Bob and Dave,

Following our review of the website text today, Louise has asked me to flag a 
business process requirement in respect of the Contact EnronOnline.

It has been decided to remove the reference and hotlink to the Legal & 
Privacy statement from underneath the "I would like to request a Guest 
Read-Only account" wording in Section 4 of the website text.  As a result, we 
need to ensure, as part of the business process, that there is text in the 
email which is sent out to the party requesting a Guest Account stating that 
the Guest Accounts are bound by the Legal & Privacy statement.  

If you have any queries please feel free to contact myself or Justin.

Regards, Edmund.

Let's be clear about all of the confusion which took place last week on how 
to register,  this is what we are doing.  Any comments or problems please 
reply.  I have tried to address everyone's points (see end of email).  

1.  Current Customers

We are going to pre-register a large number of customers prior to the 
launch.   These customers will not  receive any documentation from us apart 
from the one page application form (Password Application) and a nice glossy 
marketing brochure.

They will not be asked to fill in any form of registration documentation.  
All of the approvals should be done internally as we already trade with these 
people.

Procedure
1.  A list of customers to be pre-registered is compiled.
2.  Sign off on the list is obtained from Tax, Credit, Legal etc.
3. The customer receives from Enron a Password Application Form (postal) and 
a marketing brochure (this will be very glossy with only high level details 
nothing specific to the customer but will outline the registration process 
(to include whether to send to UK os  US office).  The PA will be specific to 
each country and therefore we should be able to send out the specific PA to 
each counterparty.
4. The customer signs the document (Password Application) and returns to 
Enron. 
5. Enron dispatches the System Administrator password and login.
6.  The customer logs in and the immediately is greeted with the ETA (as 
loaded for the specific counterparty profile which will be based on the 
country of origin of the customer).  The ETA must be printable and the 
customer will scroll through the document to the end where he has the choice 
of either "I accept" or "I do not accept" (with no default on enter).  This 
ETA must be printable.
7.   The customer then enters the site and transacts.  If the customer is 
transacting under a master then the GTC for a particular product will not 
need to be accepted, if the customer is dealing without a master then any 
person using the administrator password or any of its subsidiary passwords 
can accept the GTC (it only needs to be accepted once by any one person under 
this SA password).  The system will need to be loaded with the information as 
to whether a counterparty requires GTC or not for each commodity/product type.

Elena's questions
Q:  Will PA be available as well as ETA for viewing and printing in the 
"House"?  No only in the garden.  PA and ETA for all jurisdictions will be 
available and printable in the garden (drop down box would be my suggestion).

2.  New Customers

There are two alternative routes possible.

Procedure 1: Off Line Registration

Potential Customer will e-mail, phone to express their willingness to trade 
online, i.e. get the ID and Password
Enron will mail Registration Pack to the Potential Customer with PA for 
appropriate jurisdiction.
Customer will fill in Registration Form, sign PA and mail it back to Enron
If the customer is approved for Online Trading by Enron, it will receive the 
system administrator login and password.
The customer logs in and the immediately is greeted with the ETA (as loaded 
for the specific counterparty profile which will be based on the country of 
origin of the customer).  The ETA must be printable and the customer will 
scroll through the document to the end where he has the choice of either "I 
accept" or "I do not accept" (with no default on enter).  This ETA must be 
printable.
The customer then enters the site and transacts.The customer is transacting 
GTCs for all  products and   any person using the administrator password or 
any of its subsidiary passwords can accept the GTC (it only needs to be 
accepted once by any one person under this SA password).  


Procedure Two:  Partial OnLine Registration
Registration Pack including PAs for all jurisdictions will be available in 
the Garden
Customer has to chose (drop down box) which jurisdiction he is in,  print out 
appropriate Registration Form and PA,  fill in Registration Form, sign PA and 
mail it to Enron
Customer will fill in Registration Form, sign PA and mail it back to Enron
If the customer is approved for Online Trading by Enron, it will receive the 
system administrator login and password.
The customer logs in and the immediately is greeted with the ETA (as loaded 
for the specific counterparty profile which will be based on the country of 
origin of the customer).  The ETA must be printable and the customer will 
scroll through the document to the end where he has the choice of either "I 
accept" or "I do not accept" (with no default on enter).  This ETA must be 
printable.
The customer then enters the site and transacts.The customer is transacting 
GTCs for all  products and   any person using the administrator password or 
any of its subsidiary passwords can accept the GTC (it only needs to be 
accepted once by any one person under this SA password).  

The Registration Form is currently in draft form and I attach below but 
clearly Janine may want to add more on her side.

Elena's questions
Q:  1) Alternative 1 or 2? Both
 2) In the Garden there must be a sentence (to be drafted by CC) to inform 
potential customers that there request for access may not be granted.  YES - 
In the  garden there must be a phrase that any access may not be granted and 
that it is solely on our discretion (this is not just for Read Only its for 
all applications)
 3) Should all ETAs and PAs be available and printable in the Garden? CC 
prefers them to be available...YES

3.  Read Only Customers

If a customer / counterparty does not respond by signing our PA and therefore 
has not access to the site and we are very keen for them to be a trading 
counterparty over the Internet we want a way of showing them what they are 
missing.  So we will be sending them a password and login for read only 
access.  We could also send out to bodies like regulators or brokers etc but 
that will be up to the traders - any counterparties wanting access like this 
would apply through th eroute outlined above for new counterparties and we 
would authorise readonly access.  We will no be advertising read only access 
as available.

They will be able to enter the site for a period for time (Enron needs to be 
capable of setting system limits to the amount of time a 
customer/counterparty is given read-only access for) unable to transact but 
view only.  

Procedure
1.  Either, Enron monitors the list of counterparties having registered 
against the full counterparty list and notes that specific counterparty has 
not registered.  The trading desk with primary trading contact with such 
counterparty is contacted and asked if they would like to offer read only 
access for a period of time.
or,   a trader applies to the Online Product Control group for read only 
access for one of his customers.
2.  The Product Control Group will issue a password/login which will be time 
dated (only valid for a certain period).
3. The counterparty will login and immediately greeted by a Read Only ETA  - 
these are to be country specific.  
4. The counterparty must accept the Read Only ETA online before entering the 
site where he has been given READ ONLY access.  
5.   Under this scenario there is only one password and no capability of 
creating any further passwords (not like a system administrator password).
6. When the password expires they will need a prompt box indicating how they 
should register to continue seeing prices.

Elena's issues
1) Should Read Only ETA be printable and where? YES - should be printable 
when it appears on screen at login (no need for it to be in the garden)
2) What limitations will be imposed on the Guest User, i.e. one log in 
session, limited time etc. - This decision has to be made in order for CC to 
put an appropriate language into the Read Only ETA. Read Only ETAs for all 
jurisdictions have to be finalised by July 7th. Needs to be flexible although 
one password has no capability of creating further passwords, but the period 
of time they are allowed access will depend on each trader.  Some customers 
may be allowed in for one day others for one month.
3) In the Garden there must be a sentence (to be drafted by CC) to inform 
potential Guest User that his request for Read Only access may not be 
granted. We will not be advertising this facility and it will therefore not 
be mentioned in the garden.  The only phrase in the garden refers to 
customers who apply for a password may not get access (see above).
4) Is Read Only ETA accepted online or it should be signed and mailed back to 
Enron as a hard copy? The latest agreed was that it will be signed off line, 
but accepting it online should work as well, and seems to be a cleaner 
way...No this will be signed/clicked online just like the ETAs.

Mark's comments
System administrator will not be a trader as far as the system is concerned. 
If they are in reality that is none of our concern.  Agreed - we need to 
change the name of System Administrator to Trader Administrator
ETA acceptance process - we have legal confirmation of your comment? I would 
expect that all users that trade on the system should read and accept it 
(which I think is where Bob is coming from). Only one person per System 
Administration Password / Trader Adminstrator password accepts the ETA.

Guest only users
This concept was raised to us for the first time yesterday - and I have some 
process queries on it. See above.
How do we separate/ identify the applications? See above.
What will be the process for upgrading users f they successfully apply for 
full rights?  They need to receive a notice when their password expires which 
prompts them to follow the application process.

2 other queries  -
Why do they need an ETA when they will not be allowed to trade 
electronically? Need a Read Only ETA - see document for further understanding
Limitations to be imposed - where is this being coded and who by? There will 
be a timetable impact. This is not new and therefore isn't

Bob's comments

1. Existing Enron Customers (approx 2,000)
The first person from the customer's company logging Online has to accept 
ETA. After that ETA has to be available for viewing and printing for all 
other users.
The first person logging on will always be the Administrator (to set up his 
users) so how can a probable non-trading user accept ETAs for his traders?  
Probably will be a trader - change the password to TRADER ADMINISTRATOR 
PASSWORD/ MASTER TRADING PASSWORD

3. Unknown Customers (currently not trading with Enron) willing to get 
Trading Access
Alternative 1 most closely mirrors what we're doing for our existing customer 
base and so the procedures will already be in place for EOL Product Control / 
System Admin to run this. If the marketing pack mailing method is utilised we 
cut down on extra effort in a number of areas (marketing pack will be signed 
off by legal, business processes already there, no extra development effort, 
single point of reference).
The marketing pack is a glossy brochure advertising our site within it there 
will be the registration form, I think we do both alternatives.

Tim's comments

 The process you have described is as I understood things, except
that for Guest Users ( also referred to as Read Only Users - Regulators,
Lawyers, Brokers, Potential Traders etc).  As we discussed on Wednesday and
as Andrew mentioned yesterday, I understood the process to be as follows:

 The Guest will phone or sent e-mail (possibly fill in a form online,
that will be automatically e-mailed) to Enron System Administrator.
Customers will provide info on their name, e-mail address, mailing address,
country of incorporation  etc.   If Enron approves the customer as a Guest
user, the System Administrator will  e-mail/fax to the Guest the Read Only
ETA.  The Guest will execute the Read only ETA in hard copy and return it to
Enron (by fax or post).  Enron will then issue a Guest ID and Password.  The
Read Only ETA will be available on the website as a reminder to the Guest.
This will not be in hard copy it will be online, see above we are not going 
to advertise this read only capability.

OK?

Mark,

In terms of the order for which we should look at things, I would suggest 
that we use the same order as the launch schedule -  effectively giving as 
much time as possible to review and change as required for each.

Glad to hear that things are well in hand.

Hey Dave!

Thanks for your note.  Believe it or not, it actually is "good to be back."  
And thanks to Louise's timely intervention, I actually get to stay in Houston 
this week instead of coming over to London for the ISDA meetings.

We discussed the need to have the lawyers review the long descriptions 
yesterday and Mark Dilworth is checking on whether or not all the lawyers 
actually have access to the necessary programs on their machines.  He and I 
are meeting later this morning to talk about several of the items in your 
note and we have a meeting scheduled for tomorrow morning to show all the 
lawyers involved how to use the system to review the long descriptions.

The other topics I had on my list to keep moving this week are the matching 
of GTC's with products and continued progress on the Counterparty spreadsheet.

Harry Collins is the emissions guy.  I'm assuming he'll be part of this 
process tomorrow and I'll ask him to take a close look at the long 
descriptions and how the mesh with the GTC's.

Finally, I agree with you on the GTC variables issue.  My plan is to ask the 
lawyers involved to focus on this as they review the long descriptions for 
which they are responsible.  With me here to answer questions that may result 
in more progress but I'm still not convinced that's enough.  I hope to be 
able to spend some of my own time looking at these as you have over the last 
couple of weeks but realistically I don't think that will happen very soon.  
Maybe you can help me prioritize:  should I look first at areas with 
predicted high volume or areas where we have the least confidence in the 
quality of work to date?

Talk to you soon.

Subject: Legal Stuff

Mark,

Welcome back!

I am wondering if you could lend a hand on a few areas on the legal side of 
EnronOnline:

1) GTC Cross reference (see prior email)
2) Product Long Descriptions - these are now available in the same format as 
the customer will see - i.e. all put together by the system, as opposed to 
individual sentences in a spreadsheet. The traders should have set up all of 
the products which were required for the simulation (I haven't confirmed 
this). These products would be a good place to start and should provide a 
representative sample for the lawyers to look at. There are a few changes 
coming, as requested by Louise Hansen, Stacy Dickson and Janice Moore which I 
have not yet incorporated (but hope to within the next 2 days or so) - 
otherwise, the other products should be OK as they contain text derived from 
the spreadsheets which the lawyers have approved.

It would be helpful if you could organize for each of the lawyers to access 
the Product Manager, so they can see the long descriptions for the Products. 
Someone in the Product Control Group should be able to show you how to access 
the long descriptions in the Product Manager 

3) Emissions - Are you the emissions guy? I haven't actually discussed these 
with anyone - not sure if the lawyer list I have includes the person who 
should be looking after this?

  Mark Taylor
  Leslie Hansen
  Jeff Hodge
  Janice Moore
  Alan Aronowitz
  Harry Collins
  Stacy Dickson 

4) I still do not have a warm and fuzzy feeling that the GTC variables have 
been properly cross-referenced to the spreadsheets, and that the two work 
together to form a cohesive whole. I might just be paranoid, but I think this 
area needs closer examination. Perhaps you could spot-check a couple of GTC's 
against the products and see what you think?

Thanks for your help


Dave

I spoke to Dianne Seib concerning your e-mail.  My understanding from my 
conversation with her is that she has provided the correct wording for the 
IFERC Sumas point sometime in the past and it has not been incorporated into 
EOL yet.  Once it is incorporated, every thing is fine.  Dave, I am not sure 
this addresses your concern.  It is not clear to me whether you are concerned 
about what she has previously submitted or whether this is a new issue.  
Please let me know if I haven't addressed your concern and I will work to do 
so.

We do not have any specific laws or regulations which would marketing or 
trading
of any of the products set out in question 1 above through the internet.  
Under
Japanese law, formation of any contract does not require any formality.

Japanese law generally does not require any formalities for offers or
acceptances to be valid as such. There is no Statute of Frauds, and parties 
may
make most types of contracts orally. If there is enough evidence establishing
that the offeree agreed to the terms offered, an offeror may rely on it. In 
most
simple sales contracts for consumer goods, for example, it would be easy to
prove that the customer agreed to pay x yen for product Y. The Seller's
electronic records showing that the customer clicked on the icon to buy 
product
Y should be enough in this context.

In more complicated contracts, the structure of the seller's Web pages should 
be
carefully designed. Having no court decisions, we have no definite answer to 
the
question of enforceability of shrink-wrap agreements in Japan. However, the
legal implications of the Web-wrap, the online version of shrink-wrap, may be
somewhat different from shrink-wraps (e.g. licenses for software sold over the
counter).  Under a typical shrink-wrap license in the real world, for example,
the customer cannot break the wrapper until after the customer purchases the
product. However, in an on-line environment, a customer has a choice to click 
on
an Accept-to-Buy icon before the customer purchases the product. Further, 
with a
carefully compiled sequence of screens or pages which would in effect be able 
to
let the customer read the terms and conditions before rushing to click on the
icon, it would be easier to prove that the customer read the terms and
conditions than in a typical shrink-wrap license situation. Unlike shrink-wrap
in the real world, the seller may obtain an electronic record showing that the
customer clicked on the icon. Given these differences, the result possibly may
be more favorable to sellers online than to those using shrink-wrap licenses.

If a transaction entered into via the internet is enforceable under U.S. or 
U.K.
law and the transactions contain a choice of such law, such transactions,
including the choice of law, will be enforceable in Japan.

We do not have any clear cut answer to this since we have no relevant laws,
regulations, or court cases.  So long as  the party maintains the relevant
website with a computer server located outside Japan, the likelihood of 
Japanese
regulatory bodies to consider that the party maintaining such website
established a "physical" establishment/branch in Japan is negligible.

I agree.  I think we have enough uncertainty to deal with on enforceability 
issues that anything we can do to create a stronger legal (or equitable) 
position is worth it.

>>> "Mark - ECT Legal Taylor" <mtaylo1@ect.enron.com> 09/28 5:59 PM >>>


My analysis is that forcing the scroll through the entire agreement provides
additional comfort that the counterparty has actually looked at the agreement
and knows to what they are agreeing - it is that much more likely that the
contract will be enforceable.  It is certainly not necessary from my point of
view that the document take up the entire page rather than appearing in a
smaller window with a scroll bar down the side - in fact I think that looks 
much
better.  It would be acceptable from a legal point of view if the "agree" 
button
appeared as in the example below as long as it didn't work until the agreement
had been scrolled through.  I personally think that would create more problems
from a commercial point of view since many counterparties will try to click on
"agree" as soon as it appears without reading the agreement and get frustrated
when it doesn't work right away.

David - do you agree?

Louise,

Below is an example of where a legal agreement which you are required to 
accept,
where the "Accept" & "Decline" buttons are below the actual agreement and not
within the agreement.  The agreement itself is within a separate frame above 
the
buttons.

A line of instructional line of copy is given at the top telling users to read
the agreement by paging down and then to click on accept to continue.

A similar set up would be suitable for the GTC's as these can vary in length
between products and would allow us to control the size of the window which
should not cover up the whole quotes screen.

Let me know what you think.

All,

I am aware that early in the EnronOnline process, some GTC's were only 
generated for the "With Collateral" category and hence, all companies 
transacting in that commodity were subject to the collateral clause.

I am now starting to wonder if this was an oversight, or if there is a reason 
why all counterparties should be bound by a collateral clause for the 
following GTC's/Products:




I would appreciate any insight which any of you can offer.

Thanks,

Dear Justin
We refer to our meeting with you and the rest of the project team of 23 July
1999 and our subsequent phone call of 27 July 1999.
We thought it may be useful for us to set out in writing our advice in
relation to a number of the issues that we discussed at the above meeting
and conference call.  On that basis, please find below the following advice
on the following issues:
1. Legal and Privacy Statement.
We believe that the Legal and Privacy statement should be available on the
first entry page for the Enron website and on each of the main trading pages
in the same form and style as the other navigational links.
The Legal and Privacy statement contains important legal protections for
Enron that we think should be displayed at the earliest opportunity and in a
prominent fashion.  The more prominent the display, the easier it will be
for Enron to argue that a user of the website was aware of this statement
and therefore that it is binding on them.
2. Bid Box
When a trader clicks on a bid or offer price in the trading section of the
website a bid box appears.  It is important that this box contains wording
that indicates that at the underlying legal level the trader is making an
offer that Enron is free to accept or reject.  On that basis, we recommend
that the main wording in the bid box be "I want to buy [quantity]" or "I
want to sell [quantity]".
3. Availability of PA and ETA
There is little case law to guide us as to the best approach for ensuring
that agreements formed online are sufficiently executed to be enforced by
courts in England.  To improve Enron's argument that the ETA has been
sufficiently executed and agreed to by the counterparty, we advise that the
ETA be available for viewing and printing at all times through a hotlink in
the trading section of the website. This will assist our argument that the
ETA is incorporated by reference when a counterparty signs the PA.  If, for
some reason, (for example, the ETA is not available at the time of signing
the PA), the direct incorporation of the ETA argument fails, the hotlink to
the ETA may help to establish a course of dealing argument.  That is an
argument that over time the counterparty has been trading on the same terms
and conditions for each trade and has, therefore, affirmed its initial
acceptance of those terms and conditions.
4. Registration Forms
We look forward to an opportunity to review the online registration form for
new customers.  We also look forward to reviewing the online registration
form for view only users of the website.  Prior to our review of the view
only registration form, can you please confirm whether or not Enron will be
vetting view only applications.  If view only users are issued passwords
automatically, without a confirmation of identity or other verification or
clearance by Enron, then we should discuss the possible risks and legal
issues that may arise.
5. Master Agreements
We understand that Enron is internally discussing the relationship between
Master Agreement, NBP terms and NBP side letters.  The conclusion of these
discussion may require an amendment to the ETA, in particular clause 3(a).
6. Changes to the GTCs and ETA
It is clear from an English law perspective and the bulk of overseas
jurisdictions consulted by us that an change to the GTCs or ETA will require
the counterparty to accept the change by executing a new version of the
agreement.  Three issues have arisen in implementing this process:
(a) Marking up Changes:  From a legal as well as a public relations
perspective it is preferable that amended agreements contain a process for
indicating what changes have been made.  This process could take the form of
a list of changes or double underline or other mark-up procedure.  Changes
should be indicated against the previous version. All versions should be
dated.  Similarly, the ticker tape screen should indicate that there is a
new version until that new version is accepted.
That said, this position is advisable only if Enron can be certain that all
changes to amended agreements are identified.  If amended agreements are
presented for execution that are improperly marked-up or do not mark-up
certain changes, then Enron would have a lesser chance of enforcing these
unmarked changes than if no marking-up was shown.  Therefore, this process
is advisable only if Enron can ensure that all changes are identified.
(b) Notice of changes: We have previously discussed with you what procedure
should be adopted by Enron to notify counterparties of the change in the ETA
or GTCs.  To improve any argument that a counterparty has freely consented
to an amended agreement, we would advise that Enron adopt a procedure for
notifying counterparties of the altered agreements in advance of them taking
effect.  This notice should not be a contractual obligation, rather an
internal Enron procedure.  That said, we understand from our meeting that
there may be emergency situations requiring an immediate change to an
agreement, with the result that trading is suspended under the old
agreement.  If those circumstances are likely to be the bulk of cases when
amendments are to be made, then the notice process may not necessarily be
appropriate.  If notice is not given, then Enron would be relying on the
following elements as asserting that a counterparty freely accepted the
amended agreement:
(i) that the counterparty was prompted that the agreement had been amended
(and if mark-ups are provided, that the changes were indicated); and
(ii) that the counterparty is a professional organisation with experience in
the speed and pace of the commodities trading industry.
These elements are not conclusive but would give Enron an argument that the
counterparty is bound to any accepted amended agreement.
(c) Overseas Counsel: Advice from overseas counsel on amendment of the ETA
and GTCs did not specify that Enron would not be giving the counterparty a
period of notice of changes to the agreements, during which the counterparty
could continue to trade.  Therefore, if it is ultimately decided that no
notice period will be used, then we may need to seek further advice from
overseas counsel.
7. ETA Termination
Under your recent instructions we have amended the ETA so that it can only
be terminated for convenience by Enron.  That is, there is no express
termination for convenience right for a counterparty.  We have previously
noted that this means that an ETA may continue to be in force with a
counterparty that has ceased to trade or wishes to cease trading with Enron.
Advice from overseas counsel on the drafting of the ETA and GTCs was sought
based on a reciprocal right to terminate with notice. We will seek further
advice from overseas counsel on this issue.
8. Website Text Review
We look forward to an opportunity to review the text and layout of the
website to assess the final impact of the layout and text on the contractual
obligations formed using the website.
9. Data Protection
Since our meetings and conference call, we have discussed further our recent
advice to you on data protection.  We are currently seeking the further
advice of overseas counsel of this issue and will provide further advice to
you shortly.
10. German digital signatures
Further advice is being sought from German counsel.  We will provide you
with a response on this issue shortly.

We hope the above provides a useful summary of our advice on a number of
issues.  Please do not hesitate to contact us to discuss any aspect of this
matter.
Regards
Timothy Hughes/Andrew Wilkinson

Subject: Re: Long Descriptions - Indexes  

Thanks for your recent emails. My response to various issues raised:

Before Torrey Moorer and Jennifer deBloisBlac Denney met with the confirms 
people, I said:

1) The GTC + Long Description should cover all of the elements necessary to 
form an unambiguous contract. The paper confirmation should just be a written 
record of what has already been agreed and should not introduce any new 
concepts.

2) The Long Descriptions should cover everything which a trader would (both 
explicitly and implicitly) discuss over the telephone.

At this point, I have received all of Torrey and Jennifer's comments and they 
have been incorporated. I have also received comments from Andy Thomas, which 
he says incorporates everything which he received. Therefore, all feedback 
which was given to any of the above three individuals should now be reflected 
in the spreadsheet and the database.

In some cases, certain items of feedback were ignored because they were 
incorrect - e.g. the addition of a "price" field to the PAI list.  There were 
also some cases when multiple requests to language changes occurred to a 
single data item, or certain items of feedback were superceded by others. If 
someone says that they provided feedback which you believe is valid for 
inclusion and which has not been incorporated, please let me know the details 
of the change and who the request was passed to.

Thanks,

Dave





To: David Forster/LON/ECT@ECT
cc:  
Subject: Long Descriptions - Indexes

Dave:

One item that was left open after my meeting with Mark D. this morning was 
what the Index should look like and how much input we have had from the 
confirm desk.  My inclination was that the index should be the same language 
that we currently use in the confirmation on the theory that the GTC taken 
together with the long description should result in a complete, unambiguous 
contract.  Mark felt that the index should provide a more complete 
description than the short description abbreviation but that the full legal 
text could wait for the paper confirm.

Given Mark's view as to how this field should be dealt with, it may be that 
the confirm desk has in fact looked at all of these and said they look fine 
as far as they go and has not attempted to correct them with the full legal 
language.

Mark said he would be contacting you himself but I thought it might make 
sense to give you my version as well.

What are your thoughts?  If you'd like to discuss, I will be in by 9:00 
tomorrow but have a meeting at 10 and then the meeting with all of the 
lawyers and Mark to discuss the further long description review at 11.  

Mark

Karen,

Thank you for your email. I'm surprised you are having difficulty obtaining 
current information from me, as your email attached below postdated both my 
conversation with Philippe Travis in which he explained that GCD would like 
copies of the contracts, and the email sent to him which contained GTC's.

After speaking with Philippe, I asked Edmund Cooper, who works with Justin 
Boyd in our legal dept and who had supplied the previous email containing 
GTC's, to continue to forward EnronOnline copies as required. To my 
knowledge, this has been done.

If you are still having difficulties obtaining copies, please let me know. I 
can be contacted in Houston at 31861 and will be arriving there Thursday 
afternoon.

Thanks,

Dave

Please let me know when I can expect current information regarding the US and 
Canadian OnLine GTC's.

Because we could not obtain current information from you, Philippe (our 
Global Contracts database contact in London)  has, at my request, gathered 
information regarding the European OnLine GTC's from his contacts in 
London.   I am not aware of who "Justin" is.  Can you provide me with a last 
name? 

We still need the information regarding US and Canadian OnLine GTC's.  

Thank you,

Do you know Karen Lambert and why she needs a set of GTC's for the

I believe Philippe Travis of the GCD group has been working with Justin to

Dear Mr. Hermans:
The following are the questions I referred to in the the phone message of 
August 6.

1.  In what significant ways does Enron Online differ from the London Metal 
Exchange or the New York Mercantile Exchange in the trading of futures 
contracts (apart from the specific metals it trades) or from other on-line 
exchanges in the trading of physical metal?

2.  What are the most important benefits that a public exchange like Enron's 
brings to the steel industry?

3.  Does Enron have a trade clearing mechanism to guarantee the 
creditworthiness of suppliers and customers?

4.  Why have some on-line steel trading sites failed?

5.  Are there particular problems in trading steel on-line versus oil, 
agricultural products, or any of the other products that are successfully 
traded on-line?

Any information you are able to supply would be greatly appreciated.

PA

They wish to amend the PA such that:

Enron warrants that their use of the passwords and the Website does not cause 
them to breach any third party rights 
they only notify us of unauthorised disclosure or use of passwords upon their 
learning of the same.
they can withdraw or amend information provided to Enron from time to time

ETA

They do not want to be bound by future terms and conditions imposed by Enron 
(see 1(iii))
They wish to restrict our use of information to Enron Group companies (see 
last sentence of 2(b))
They feel unable to make the statement in the first sentence of 2(d), since 
they trade through various group company agents on behalf of a BV principal
To establish a tangible audit trail and for verification, they wish to be 
able to verify our paper confirms (see 3(e))
They wish to restructure the indemnity entirely (see 4), such that each party 
is liable for losses suffered by the other due to its own wilful 
default/negligence/omission.
They wish to have the right to terminate the ETA (see 6(a)), and wish that 
electronic notices be deemed sent when the sender receives notice from the 
system of delivery or failed delivery (see 6(e)).

Some of these are more important than others, but there are some key points.  
Please let me know what you think - thanks

Justin

Dear Justin/Edmund,

Mark Taylor asked me to forward a sample OTC Weather Derivative Confirmation 
in a Deemed ISDA format for use in connection with your On-Line Trading 
Project.  Attached please find a template for a Single Season CDD Cap Option 
Confirmation which we would use with a US Corporate Counterparty with whom no 
ISDA is in place and no credit support is required. 



Please note that is the most "plain vanilla" version we use and depending 
upon the counterparty, it may need credit support language or additional 
representations (if CP is a non-corporate). If the counterparty is foreign, 
we would of course need the appropriate tax annex.   

I imagine this will serve as a starting point. Please let me know if you have 
questions or would like to see confirmations for  other types of weather 
derivatives.

Kind regards, 

Shari

Mark,

please have a look in the "Long Descriptions" worksheet in the file attached. 
Descriptions are combined from different components defined on other pages 
per trading desk. Product lines in blue colour font on yellow background have 
been already reviewed twice, blue on white - once, black on white - haven't 
been reviewed yet.

Please e-mail/call if you have any questions or would like to have a fax as 
well.
Regards,
Elena

Paul

There are 2 ways of setting product tenors:

1 - specific, where the start and end dates are selected from drop down 
calendars on the product manager. 

2 - tokenised, where we have set up a record for the period in the database, 
and the rules applicable to it (e.g. Balance of Month, Day ahead) - the rules 
ensure that the specific start and end dates for such a product are shown in 
the product short description. 

Please note that any tokenised periods will need to be set up prior to 
building products in the product manager.

Last year we pre-registered approvals to trade Coal in Europe on EOL - which 
was a bit premature. 

The commercial team are now ready to proceed with 'getting online' and have a 
standard contract that Robert and Peter have worked on with which I believe 
we can look to finalise the details of descriptions for EnronOnline. (copy 
attached)

Please can we get together early next week to go through the steps required 
to get this up and running?

Mark,

I attach Cadwalader's memorandum in its final version.  This is the product 
of a number of discussions/comments between myself and David Mitchell.  It 
has been written on the basis that trading is carried on outside the US; 
obviously, a different memorandum would be required in relation of trading 
carried on by ECT from Houston.

Look forward to seeing you on Wednesday, and of course at the Conference!

Justin

It is becoming increasingly clear that the development of eCommerce will ha=

a significant and continuing impact on the conduct of business in a broad=
=20
array of industries.  Through EnronOnLine, Enron has quickly become a major=
=20
catalyst for the transition to the web in the gas and electric industries. =
=20
EnronOnLine has been an enormous success since its launch.  Since launch, w=
e=20
have completed 67,043 transactions on line, with a total dollar value of ov=
er=20
$25 billion.  EnronOnLine is now the largest eCommerce site in the world.

We believe that the competitive success of EnronOnLine is due to one very=
=20
specific reason.  In addition to providing a web-based platform for=20
transactions, Enron acts as principal to provide direct liquidity to the=20
site.  We stand ready at all times, in any market conditions, to buy and se=
ll=20
at the posted price.  This converts a =01&bulletin board=018 (the more typi=
cal=20
eCommerce concept) into a true market.  There are very few, if any,=20
competitors that can provide this capability.

We are increasingly convinced that this competitive advantage can be=20
dramatically expanded to other products and other geographies.  If we are=
=20
correct, this could provide an enormous new opportunity for growth for Enro=
n.

Accordingly, we are initiating a major new effort to capture this=20
opportunity.  Effective today we are creating a new business, Enron Net=20
Works, to pursue new market development opportunities in eCommerce across a=
=20
broad range of industries.  It is likely that this business will ultimately=
=20
be our fifth business segment, joining transmission & distribution,=20
wholesale, retail and broadband services.

Included in this business will be our entire IT and technology group along=
=20
with significant talent and resources in market making and finance. =20
Initially, North America will provide primary direct support for staff=20
services and back office, however, over time we will be requesting support=
=20
services from virtually all Enron units to ensure continued growth and=20
success.  To facilitate the combining of commercial capabilities with these=
=20
new eCommerce platforms, Enron Net Works will work closely with the merchan=
t=20
functions of North America, Europe, South America, CALME, Asia and Broadban=
d.

Enron Net Works will be headed by Greg Whalley, Chief Executive Officer; Mi=
ke=20

Officer.  These individuals will comprise the Office of the Chairman for=20
Enron Net Works and remain on the Executive Committee of Enron Corp. =20
Replacing Greg Whalley as President and Chief Operating Officer of Enron=20
North America is Dave Delainey, who will also join Enron=01,s Executive=20
Committee.

Global Technology will remain intact but will now be a part of Enron Net=20

as=20
an Enron global function.  Philippe Bibi will remain the Chief Technology=
=20
Officer for all of Enron Corp. and continues to be responsible for the=20

EnronOnLine, headed by Louise Kitchen, will also remain intact and will now=

ie Mark Taylor

The only concern he had from a legal perspective was that in the Skilling 
quote "Enron as a principle"  - that we might want to change it to "an Enron 
company as a principle". - Minor 

But he does have a point with the line before - remove the "just" as we don't 
actually match buyers and sellers at all.

Janice,

Following your earlier request to Robert for the liquids GTCs, I attach the 
latest versions that we have developed.  Apart from a couple of minor 
additional comments from London Tax we currently have no further amendments 
that we wish to make to these documents.

If you have any queries please feel free to contact Justin or myself.

Kind regards, Edmund.

Jennifer,

Here is the language which should be used for Gas Daily. It has been revised 
and approved by Mark Taylor:

Daily price midpoint example (For Gas Daily, Oklahoma-PEPL):

The Index for a day shall be the Daily Midpoint price published on such 
calendar day under the heading "Daily Price Survey" in the Oklahoma - PEPL 
section of Gas Daily, or if a calendar day is not a business day then the 
price used shall be the Daily Midpoint price published on the next succeeding 
business day.


Please proceed with subsituting as required to complete the index updates.

Thanks,

Dave

Dale,

I have discussed the wording with Rudy and agree that we could change the 
wording in the Index long description for Gasoline, #2 and WTI as follows:


Old:

The Index for a month shall be the arithmetic average of the daily  
settlement 
prices for the prompt month NYMEX West Texas Intermediate Light, Sweet, Crude 
Oil 
futures contract for each NYMEX trading day of such month.



New:

The Index for a Determination Period shall be the arithmetic average of the 
daily  
settlement prices for the promptmonth NYMEX West Texas Intermediate Light, 
Sweet, 
Crude Oil futures contract for each NYMEX trading day of such Determination 
Period.



Please run these changes past legal before proceeding. When your changes are 
complete, please run the final version past Rudy as well. Please note that 
all 
Products which reference these Indexes will need the secret squirrel 
treatment for 
updating.

Niamh/Duncan: Please advise if you are happy for the above change to be 
applied 
to your products as well.

Thanks,

Dave

Louise -

Please get in touch with me to discuss a press release. Given the
information in the Wall Street Journal, Enron has gone public with the
importance of this work and how it is functioning and we want to 'strike
while the iron is hot' with a followup release from us.

My cell phone is 630 235 1121. I will be in the office all next week. If
I don't pick up my phone, please '0' out and ask the receptionist to
find me.

Thanks,
Dave

Subject: Re: Master Agreements  

Dave - we did consider this at the time and decided not to proceed on the 
basisi of a formal amendment of each of the Masters, for the following 
reasons:

It would take considerable time to prepare (particularly in the US where 
there are a much greater number of Masters) the necessary amendment 
agreements.
Each Master would need to be separately considered and individual amendments 
prepared.
The process of securing the agreement of each counterparty to an amendment 
would have delayed the Project
In proposing a formal amendment, this would have meant identifying to the 
marketplace the Project. 

Clause 3 of the ETA sets out how we have dealt with the execution of trades 
online wherer existing Masters are in place.

Justin

Just out of curiosity:

The GTC's state that GTC's will be used "Until a Master Agreement is 
executed" . . .

Do we need to modify our standard Master Agreements to be consistent with 
either the concepts or terms of EnronOnline?

I realise we are willing to accept variations for existing master agreements, 
but I assume we would want to ensure that new Masters are as consistent as 
possible . . .

On Friday we will be receiving the remaining customer list from credit, due 
to the timescales I am asking for turnaround on the customer matrix and 
master agreement review by the end of play Tuesday 12th October.

Any problems with this please notify me immediately as we are now running up 
against very tight deadlines in terms of getting all of the information in 
the system for the launch schedule.

Thanks

Louise

Mark,
On another note we are requesting a review of the blanket decision which has 
been made to prevent any regulated utility from completing any financial 
transactions, if we are not prepared to do the due diligence on which ones 
can transact and which ones can not - is this our responsibility or theirs?  
ie their decision whether to trade or not.

I am pleased to attach for your review the opinion of Linklaters you 
requested addressing the question of whether EnronOnline's activities 
constitute "arranging" under the FSA 1986.  Kindly acknowledge receipt.

I trust this meets your requirements and look forward to receiving your

Hi Mark,  this is an email that I recieved from Lisa Gillette, who is a 
member of Product Control and is in charge of the Customer Registration 
Process.   In reviewing this process, I think this is a concern that truly 
falls in your realm.  Please review and get back to Lisa or myself.


"There seems to be some concern abou the Customer Registration from.  As of 
right now the Registration Form does not include a "State or Country of 
Incorporation" and needed to know if the form should be amended to include 
one.  Please let me know either directly or via Carrie Southard if this is 
something that we need to take care of."

Thank you,

Lisa Gillette

Attached is the consolidated list of counterparties for the week ending 
12/3.  All other lists sent to you by various people this week can be 
ignored.  If a counterpartys says "declined" by Credit, you don't need to 
look at it.  If there is nothing in the box it means "approved" and, as of 
today, look at "divisions" which means they are trading out of a division  
The "division" issue is up in the air and is being looked at on a going 
forward basis.

Per my agreeement with each of the physical groups, IF I DO NOT HEAR FROM YOU 
IN ONE DAY, I WILL ASSUME THE COUNTERPARTY IS APPROVED TO TRADE ALL THE 
PRODUCTS THAT CREDIT HAS APPROVED FOR THAT COUNTERPARTY.  We rarely expect 
counterparty issues from the physical trading groups, most of the 
counterparty issues will be with the financial trading counterparties.  I 
ONLY NEED TO HEAR FROM YOU IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH A COUNTERPARTY.

Most of the physical trading group's issues will revolve around which 
contract to use, and that should be resolved directly with Global Contracts, 
in the same way you resolve such issues on an "off-line" basis.

Credit is redoing the 12/6 and 12/7 lists they sent to me earlier, and I will 
forward them to you as soon as I receive them.

David,

Further to your earlier email I am pleased to attach the following documents 
for
you to draw up blacklined versions of the US versions of the PA and ETA you
distributed earlier:

PA- version 9 that was sent to Enron on 20 July 1999, version 10
incorporating comments from the meeting between Clifford Chance and Justin 
Boyd
and myself, and a mark up showing
the changes between the two.

ETA- version 7 that was sent to Enron on 20 July 1999, version 8
incorporating comments from the meeting between Clifford Chance and Justin 
Boyd
and myself, and a mark up showing
the changes between the two.

Please use version 10 of the PA and version 8 of the ETA for your blackline 
for
us.

Please let me know if you need an alternate format of document for your 
computer
systems.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards, Edmund.

Mark:  I apologize for not copying you on this message yesterday.   We 
received confirmation from Pat Markey yesterday morning that global liquids 
will start on-line trading January 5th and that we needed to expedite the 
on-line confirmations asap.  In the process of preparing the confirms we 
realized that minor changes needed to be made to ELFI and ERAC's GTCs so we 
forward them directly to Dale Neuner.  David Forster called me last evening 
and I went over the changes to each of the GTCs with him.  He said that he 
will make the changes right away so that we will have the revised version 
on-line this morning. 

Thanks.

As per our t/c of this morning, Harry Collins and I have reviewed the on-line 
templates for ELFI and ERAC and are forwarding the new versions as indicated 
below.   

ELFI
GTCs:  In reviewing the US GTCs as of 5 Oct 99 we have noticed that ELFI's 
GTCs do not include the Brent terms and conditions as previously submitted on 
30 Aug 99.  Please update with the attached version. 
    

 Confirmation:   Attached are the revised ELFI on-line confirms to reflect 
minor changes as requested by DC&D:
  Colonial Pipeline 

  Brent trading  

ERAC

 GTCs:  We have made minor changes to ERAC's GTCs in the Delivery and Tax 
sections.

      
    
 Confirmation:      

EGLI 
  GTCs:  No changes.

  Confirmation:  We will follow up with on-line confirm in the morning.

Should you have any questions regarding the above, please feel free to call 
me at 37541.

Thanks.
Nony Flores

Nony,

Global Liquids is definitely planning on starting trading on January 5th.  
Therefore, we need to get the templates fixed ASAP.  I think the language 
changes should be minimal; however, this will help to clean up any 
inconsistencies in the current language.  Please give me a call today at 
X31720 when you get a chance to discuss.  Also, I'm not sure if you've worked 
with the crude confirms as well.  They have some inconsistencies in their 
language as well.

Thanks,

Pat Markey

Mark,

Welcome back!

I am wondering if you could lend a hand on a few areas on the legal side of 
EnronOnline:

1) GTC Cross reference (see prior email)
2) Product Long Descriptions - these are now available in the same format as 
the customer will see - i.e. all put together by the system, as opposed to 
individual sentences in a spreadsheet. The traders should have set up all of 
the products which were required for the simulation (I haven't confirmed 
this). These products would be a good place to start and should provide a 
representative sample for the lawyers to look at. There are a few changes 
coming, as requested by Louise Hansen, Stacy Dickson and Janice Moore which I 
have not yet incorporated (but hope to within the next 2 days or so) - 
otherwise, the other products should be OK as they contain text derived from 
the spreadsheets which the lawyers have approved.

It would be helpful if you could organize for each of the lawyers to access 
the Product Manager, so they can see the long descriptions for the Products. 
Someone in the Product Control Group should be able to show you how to access 
the long descriptions in the Product Manager 

3) Emissions - Are you the emissions guy? I haven't actually discussed these 
with anyone - not sure if the lawyer list I have includes the person who 
should be looking after this?

  Mark Taylor
  Leslie Hansen
  Jeff Hodge
  Janice Moore
  Alan Aronowitz
  Harry Collins
  Stacy Dickson 

4) I still do not have a warm and fuzzy feeling that the GTC variables have 
been properly cross-referenced to the spreadsheets, and that the two work 
together to form a cohesive whole. I might just be paranoid, but I think this 
area needs closer examination. Perhaps you could spot-check a couple of GTC's 
against the products and see what you think?

Thanks for your help


Dave

Just for clarification we did not use Sullivan & Cromwell for the Internet 
primarily we hired S&C as our financial/regulatory lawyers in the US the 
Internet issues were covered by Clifford Chance although obviously we were 
suffering with CC and used S&C to help us out but they had no expertise in 
the Internet and ecommerce.

Please can you check:
1. that the title of the document is correct; and
2. that we need to have a 'Version 1 - 10 August 1999' in the header.  I have

You will see those components when we build a complete product. What you have 
reviewed is simply the PRODUCT TYPE description. You and I will review a 
complete PRODUCT description once one is created.

II have tried to approve this through the Data Manager - not sure if it 
worked.

I know we must have been through this any number of times before but each 
time I read one of these I wonder how we are supposed to figure out the 
Notional Quantity.  It says "calculated from the volume submitted by 
Counterparty on the website" but how do we know how to calculate it?  Where 
does it say whether that number is a daily or monthly number?  Gallons or 
Barrels?  I remain confused.

Mark and Bjorn-

I've created a new Product Type - Jet Kero Financial Swap. The automatic 
e-mail notification isn't working so I won't know if you go in and approve 
the product. Please review the attached, as well as the below Long 
Description, and offer you approval/comments. (You will find it in the 
Partially Approved section - as credit has offered their sign-off). As you 
could imagine trading is eager to get this out on the web.

Mark - Once the Product Type is approved we will build the complete product 
and I'll send that to you for review.

"A US Jet Kerosene financial Swap Transaction with Enron North America Corp. 
under which the Seller pays a 
Floating Price and the Buyer pays the price submitted by Counterparty on the 
website (the Fixed Price) in respect 
of the Notional Quantity per Determination Period. The Notional Quantity per 
Determination Period shall be 
calculated from the volume submitted by Counterparty on the website. Each 
calendar month during the term 
of the Transaction will be a Determination Period. The Payment Date(s) will 
be 5 business days after the 
Floating Price is determinable.  The Floating Price shall be the Index for 
the relevant Determination Period."

Dear Mark

In Yasuyoshi Goto's view the agreements are well drafted and contain nothing
which is likely to cause a problem in Japan.  On the understanding that server
is to be located outside Japan, we have only the following comments:

Time of Execution

Section 3. (c) of the ELECTRONIC TRADING AGREEMENT provides that "Transaction
shall be deemed executed at the time that Enron first signifies its acceptance
of Counterparty's offer, accessible on the Website server."

We understand that this means a contract will be formed when Enron 
"dispatches"
its acceptance to its Website server so that the acceptance can be seen by the
Counterparty's computer display (if he has not yet disconnected).  In other
words, the contract will be formed at that time even though the Counterparty
does not see Enron's acceptance (due to disconnection, communication error, or
some other reason).  If this is indeed the intention, the language could 
perhaps
be clarified in this regard.  (Since the agreement is governed by New York 
law,
we have no objection to the current language if this is clear under New York
Law.  Perhaps the UCC covers the point?)

Governing Law/Jurisdiction

We see no problem with the governing law and jurisdiction provisions as they
are.

Taxation

Would you please confirm the role if any to be performed by Enron Japan in
relation to this business, so that we can ensure that Enron Japan will not be
seen as a dependent agent (and therefore permanent establishment) of Enron 
North
America Corp.

Best regards

Many of the oil products are monthly or total volume but most of them seem to 
be adjusted accordingly.

the current paper descriptions says:

"....Seller pays a Floating Price and the Buyer pays the price submitted by 
Counterparty on the website (the Fixed Price) in each case in respect of the 
Notional Quantity per Determination Period.  Each calendar month during the 
term of the Transaction will be a Determination Period. The Notional Quantity 
per Determination Period is the volume submitted multiplied by the number 
days in the relevant Determination Period."

suggestion:

"....Seller pays a Floating Price and the Buyer pays the price submitted by 
Counterparty on the website (the Fixed Price) in each case in respect of the 
Notional Quantity per Determination Period.  Each calendar month during the 
term of the Transaction will be a Determination Period. The Notional Quantity 
per Determination Period is the volume submitted by Counterparty on the 
website."

If you all agree, I'll make this change in the BlackMaster. Dave, it may need 
lawyers validation?

Paper volumes are actually per month not per day in each determination 
period. We need to change the long descriptions.

When you get a chance, have a quick read.  John got approval on Wednesday 
from Skilling and Whalley to move forward quickly.  We have committed to 
quoting on 200 reference credits, in 6 countries using Enron Online by 15 
Jan.   As we intend to quote two-way prices on your biggest customers, in 
addition to everyone else, I want to make sure that we evaluate all of the 
implications.

 Pls. let me know your thoughts.

List 1 (695 counterparts) completed profiles, headroom and tenor
List 2 (464 counterparts) 300 to be completed profiles, headroom and tenor 
(approx 164 branches, divisions or trash - Debbie to give more details) by Fri
List 3 (51 counterparts)  Next week
List 4 (331 counterparts) Next week

Master Agreements:

List 1 (695 counterparts) by Fri
List 2 (464 counterparts) 300 to be completed by next Fri
List 3 (51 counterparts)  Next week
List 4 (331 counterparts) Next week

Debbie and I will address reject list early next week.  I support sending 
brochures to branches/divisions with process to deal with assuring trading 
only occurs with approved trading entity.

If we can finalize everything by next week we can assure approved profiles 
for startup.  Please contact me if there are any concerns with this schedule.

Subject: Update

Can  someone please update me as to where we stand on:

1) Legal Review
 - Do we have a complete list of master agreements yet for all companies on 
the mailing list?
 - Has legal reviewed the counterparty list and noted any with which they 
think we cannot do business?
 - Has legal adjusted the above to reflect differing state laws? (i.e. has 
not applied a broad brush to all states on account of restrictive laws in 
some)?

2) Credit Review

Can someone fill in the blanks in the attached matrix of credit to-do items 
with the current status and/or ETA of each item?

Profile = Collateral/Non-Collateral/R-O access status identified
Headroom = Credit limit to be used against sigma factors
Tenor = maximum deal length limit
List 1-4 = As per Bob's spreadsheet
List 5 = This is what I am calling the original list of companies which 
credit rejected, but for which they were going to do some additional analysis 
to see if all of them really should have been rejected (the list of 400 
"rejected" companies which credit sent to us).

  Profile  Headroom  Tenor  

List 1  Done  
List 2  
List 3
List 4
List 5

3) Sigma factors

Who is looking after this? When will it be completed for each Product Type?


Thanks,

Dave

Here are the preliminary drafts of the term sheets. The scenario highlights are:

Exchange will host its private label exchange and the central transaction engine and database
Exchange will buy the hardware needed for the implementation
Exchange will define the scope of the hardware needed for local handheld devices and specialist software
Exchange will map and integrate the solution to its back-office systems. Technology provider will provide Exchange with a standardized format data feed to the back-office (we still need to decide how the data format will be defined and who will define it)
Technology Provider will provide all the software and consulting needed  for the solution implementation
Technology provider will be compensated for his solution

Specialist will receive compensation for managing products
Specialist will use commercially best efforts to maintain a defined spread on the product it manages
Specialist will have the option to stream price/volume pairs form the system to its own principal platform
Specialist will have the option to stream its own markets to the system (rules need to be defined)
Specialist will pay no clearing or exchange fees for the products it manages
Specialist will have fill participation advantages

I wanted to follow up with you regarding the general terms and conditions 
(GTC) for the products to be sold via Enron Online.  Per our memo dated 
August 5, 1999, the GTCs for coal and power products did not include any tax 
language.  For Enron's protection, it is imperative that the appropriate tax 
language be added to these documents.  Please let me know how we can ensure 
the appropriate tax language is in our online GTC's before we go live.

> Dear Justin
> We refer to our meeting with you and the rest of the project team of 23
> July 1999 and our subsequent phone call of 27 July 1999.
> We thought it may be useful for us to set out in writing our advice in
> relation to a number of the issues that we discussed at the above meeting
> and conference call.  On that basis, please find below the following
> advice on the following issues:
> 1. Legal and Privacy Statement.
> We believe that the Legal and Privacy statement should be available on the
> first entry page for the Enron website and on each of the main trading
> pages in the same form and style as the other navigational links.
> The Legal and Privacy statement contains important legal protections for
> Enron that we think should be displayed at the earliest opportunity and in
> a prominent fashion.  The more prominent the display, the easier it will
> be for Enron to argue that a user of the website was aware of this
> statement and therefore that it is binding on them.
> 2. Bid Box
> When a trader clicks on a bid or offer price in the trading section of the
> website a bid box appears.  It is important that this box contains wording
> that indicates that at the underlying legal level the trader is making an
> offer that Enron is free to accept or reject.  On that basis, we recommend
> that the main wording in the bid box be "I want to buy [quantity]" or "I
> want to sell [quantity]".
> 3. Availability of PA and ETA
> There is little case law to guide us as to the best approach for ensuring
> that agreements formed online are sufficiently executed to be enforced by
> courts in England.  To improve Enron's argument that the ETA has been
> sufficiently executed and agreed to by the counterparty, we advise that
> the ETA be available for viewing and printing at all times through a
> hotlink in the trading section of the website. This will assist our
> argument that the ETA is incorporated by reference when a counterparty
> signs the PA.  If, for some reason, (for example, the ETA is not available
> at the time of signing the PA), the direct incorporation of the ETA
> argument fails, the hotlink to the ETA may help to establish a course of
> dealing argument.  That is an argument that over time the counterparty has
> been trading on the same terms and conditions for each trade and has,
> therefore, affirmed its initial acceptance of those terms and conditions.
> 4. Registration Forms
> We look forward to an opportunity to review the online registration form
> for new customers.  We also look forward to reviewing the online
> registration form for view only users of the website.  Prior to our review
> of the view only registration form, can you please confirm whether or not
> Enron will be vetting view only applications.  If view only users are
> issued passwords automatically, without a confirmation of identity or
> other verification or clearance by Enron, then we should discuss the
> possible risks and legal issues that may arise.
> 5. Master Agreements
> We understand that Enron is internally discussing the relationship between
> Master Agreement, NBP terms and NBP side letters.  The conclusion of these
> discussion may require an amendment to the ETA, in particular clause 3(a).
> 6. Changes to the GTCs and ETA
> It is clear from an English law perspective and the bulk of overseas
> jurisdictions consulted by us that an change to the GTCs or ETA will
> require the counterparty to accept the change by executing a new version
> of the agreement.  Three issues have arisen in implementing this process:
> (a) Marking up Changes:  From a legal as well as a public relations
> perspective it is preferable that amended agreements contain a process for
> indicating what changes have been made.  This process could take the form
> of a list of changes or double underline or other mark-up procedure.
> Changes should be indicated against the previous version. All versions
> should be dated.  Similarly, the ticker tape screen should indicate that
> there is a new version until that new version is accepted.
> That said, this position is advisable only if Enron can be certain that
> all changes to amended agreements are identified.  If amended agreements
> are presented for execution that are improperly marked-up or do not
> mark-up certain changes, then Enron would have a lesser chance of
> enforcing these unmarked changes than if no marking-up was shown.
> Therefore, this process is advisable only if Enron can ensure that all
> changes are identified.
> (b) Notice of changes: We have previously discussed with you what
> procedure should be adopted by Enron to notify counterparties of the
> change in the ETA or GTCs.  To improve any argument that a counterparty
> has freely consented to an amended agreement, we would advise that Enron
> adopt a procedure for notifying counterparties of the altered agreements
> in advance of them taking effect.  This notice should not be a contractual
> obligation, rather an internal Enron procedure.  That said, we understand
> from our meeting that there may be emergency situations requiring an
> immediate change to an agreement, with the result that trading is
> suspended under the old agreement.  If those circumstances are likely to
> be the bulk of cases when amendments are to be made, then the notice
> process may not necessarily be appropriate.  If notice is not given, then
> Enron would be relying on the following elements as asserting that a
> counterparty freely accepted the amended agreement:
> (i) that the counterparty was prompted that the agreement had been amended
> (and if mark-ups are provided, that the changes were indicated); and
> (ii) that the counterparty is a professional organisation with experience
> in the speed and pace of the commodities trading industry.
> These elements are not conclusive but would give Enron an argument that
> the counterparty is bound to any accepted amended agreement.
> (c) Overseas Counsel: Advice from overseas counsel on amendment of the ETA
> and GTCs did not specify that Enron would not be giving the counterparty a
> period of notice of changes to the agreements, during which the
> counterparty could continue to trade.  Therefore, if it is ultimately
> decided that no notice period will be used, then we may need to seek
> further advice from overseas counsel.
> 7. ETA Termination
> Under your recent instructions we have amended the ETA so that it can only
> be terminated for convenience by Enron.  That is, there is no express
> termination for convenience right for a counterparty.  We have previously
> noted that this means that an ETA may continue to be in force with a
> counterparty that has ceased to trade or wishes to cease trading with
> Enron.  Advice from overseas counsel on the drafting of the ETA and GTCs
> was sought based on a reciprocal right to terminate with notice. We will
> seek further advice from overseas counsel on this issue.
> 8. Website Text Review
> We look forward to an opportunity to review the text and layout of the
> website to assess the final impact of the layout and text on the
> contractual obligations formed using the website.
> 9. Data Protection
> Since our meetings and conference call, we have discussed further our

> further advice of overseas counsel of this issue and will provide further

Harry:

Attatched is a document containg the basic structure of the auction as we 
envision it. Please keep in mind that it is a work in progress and will be 
modified as we develop a better idea of the auction.
Below are certain questions we need clarification on.

Structure:
Do we have any CFTC exposure?
By the nature of the auction structure, are we not implicitly matching? If 
yes then how does this affect the previous answer?
Do we have exposure to the lottery commission if we offer a free gift during 
the auction?

Contract:
To limit our exposure due to failure of the system etc. what sort of Force 
Majure clause can we incorporate in the contract?
To what extent are electronically signed contracts enforceable?

Internal:
Can other trading desks at Enron other than the emissions desk participate in 
this auction?
What limitations can be placed on the emissions desk as far as information 
sharing and usage are concerned? both during and after the auction?


Thank You

Zal

Tana,

ECT Houston can engage in commodity/weather derivatives trades direct with 
French counterparties, without having to use EEFT as the UK regulated 
arranger.  Put another way, whatever ECTRI can do from a regulatory 
perspective, the same applies to ECT Houston.  Please refer to the completed 
list that Edmund sent.

As for engaging in derivatives trades with utilities, this does not give rise 
to the issues as under US laws.  [In respect of new counterparties, standard 
due diligence as to corporate authority, etc will need to be done].

Hope all's well!

What do you guys think about this?

Interesting report on successful case brought against internet business
which suggests that internet businesses face increasing risk of being sued
in any jurisdiction in which their sites can be accessed. Ruling by New York
State Supreme Court.

Whilst dealing with gaming, as a criminal offence was likely to attract more
interest, offshore company had its computers in Antigua but held to be
governed by New York State gaming laws because New Yorkers were able to
access the site and place bets.

Attached are revised drafts of the New York PA and ETA, which have been 
revised to reflect the latest Clifford Chance drafts and our discussion 
yesterday.  We are unable to blackline these drafts, due to the fact that the 
Clifford Chance drafts are not on our system (and we did not receive all of 
them in any event).  Also, we have not yet received from Mark's office the 
language on confirmations; we have taken a shot at it but can obviously 
modify it after we get the language.

Finally, we have attached a blackline of the "Legal and Privacy" statement, 
reflecting some suggested changes.  We also note that, if this document is to 
be "global", we will either need to decide on a single governing law or 
delete choice of law entirely.

Best regards.

I have been reviewing procedures that would need to be put in place to cover 
counterparties from other jurisdictions trading Australian power. There is 
one related contractual issue I have not been able resolve. As it is not an 
issue at peculiar to Australia I would appreciate your input. My apologies in 
advance if I am covering well trodden ground. 

It is settled that a counterparty will enter into one Password Agreement and 
one ETA. There will be a principal Enron contracting party for the PA and 
ETA, which I will refer to as the  "Enron Principal" . However the definition 
of "Enron"in both documents also includes other Enron affiliates. In this way 
the Enron Principal enters into the PA and the ETA as an agent for any 
affiliate that may at some stage enter into an EnronOnline Transaction with 
that counterparty. This means the relevant Enron affiliate could enforce the 
terms of the PA and ETA . This is in addition to the rights of the Enron 
Principal to enforce the ETA and PA. But what happens if the Enron affiliate 
is not in existence (i.e. has not been incorporated)  at the time the PA is 
signed and the ETA is  accepted by the counterparty? It is settled law in 
Australia and I believe in England that you cannot be a party to a contract 
if you don't exist.  

What does this mean? Well in most instances not much. If it was a question  
of enforcement of the contractual terms of the ETA or the PA the Enron 
Principal could seek the relevant remedy such as an injunction or specific 
performance. But procedural problems in litigation could arise if a newly 
incorporated Enron company suffered damage through a breach by a counterparty 
of the ETA. For example a breach of the indemnity in clause 4. The Enron 
Principal could not sue for damages as it would have suffered none. 

Whilst not a major issue it may be prudent to ensure EnronOnline procedures 
recognise the particular circumstances that arise when introducing a newly 
incorporated Enron entities as contracting parties through EnronOnline.

After discussing the status of our outstanding PA's with credit we have 
adjusted the proceess to get us in line with our 3 day turnaround objective.  
By close of business 11/19 we should have all PA's received prior to 11/16 
processed with a status of: ID mailed, waiting on customer info or Requires 
Div/Branch Resolution.  The following process will be used moving forward:

PA's received from from Initial Mailout Counterparties with Credit reject 
status (bankruptcy, E rating 10, 11, 12) will be mailed read only id and 
letter to indicating a need for them to call us to discuss options for 
getting execute status ( these calls will be forwarded to credit)

PA's received from Initial Mailout Counterparties with Credit reject status 
($0 exposure, no info) will be contacted by PCG to obtain a credit contact, 
Credit will call credit contact and try to obtain required info.  Once Credit 
has contacted counterparty and requested info, PA status report will reflect 
- Waiting on customer info.  Credit will have ownership of moving this issue 
forward in a timely manner. 

Credit will give initial mailout counterparties priority over new application 
requests however the turnaround objective for all PA's remains at three days.

New applications and PA's will be forwarded to credit immediately upon 
receipt (unless it is a muni or utility which will be forwarded to legal 
first).  Credit should not reject a muni or utility for anything other than 
credit issues.  Legal will address legal and regulatory issues.

Divisions/Branches with approved parent should have the ability to trade.  
Dave Forster is trying to develop a work around for the credit upload issue 
surrounding division/branches.  Until this issue is resolved the PA report 
will state Requires Div/Branch Resolution.

PA's which are completed with execute status will state Execute ID mailed

PA's which are completed with read only status will state Read-Only ID mailed

PA's which are under credit review will state such on the PA report

Please contact me immediately if you have an issue with any of the above at 
30397.

We are planning to hold a meeting to kick off the Phase 2 project of 
EnronOnline on 3rd March in Houston.  This meeting will focus on the new look 
for the site and content to be added based on our own thoughts and the 
feedback from customers and our own trading desks. 

A more strategic meeting on the direction for EnronOnline will be held later.

An agenda will be sent out at the beginning of next week.  For those outside 
of Houston, copies of all presentations will be sent to you and you can 
participate by phone if you wish.

Mark,

I've made a few adjustments from the previous spreadsheet.

1)  the US Gas spread products have been pulled--they no longer want to offer 
these. (that problem is solved fairly easily, eh?)

2)  all the weather fallbacks have been entered

3)  the strike prices for HDDs and CDDs are the Bid/Offer amounts...

4)  the indices should be denoted "P" or "F" for physical and financial 
products.


Still unresolved:

1)  A "Strike Price" field--not sure where we are on this, but I should have 
an update for the beginning of the next week.

2)  all of the 'daily settlement fo the arithmetic average' questions have 
not been resolved--the confirm group is handling this 'as we email', so once 
I receive an update from them, I will forward it to you.

Regards,
Andy

Thanks for your email.   It is important on a going forward basis that if we 
veer from any restriction that Legal has placed on a counterparty (e.g. if 
Credit says it is ok to trade weather under a GTC instead of a master) that 
Legal hear before we trade so we all make sure we are on the same 
understanding as to whether any restriction should be waived.  In response to 
your email I have the following comments:

1.  The New York Times Company:  cannot trade derivatives online at all.  
Their board resolution and master agreement require that two specific 
officers must enter into the trade together on a telephone call.  They cannot 
trade any other way without revising their board resolution and agreement.  
All their  trades must be done by telephone.
2.  San Diego Gas & Electric Company:  the California PUC said that utilities 
such as San Diego cannot enter into derivatives transactions at all!
3.  Aspect Resources:  can enter into derivative transactions.  We want the 
transactions to roll up under the existing ISDA Master Agreement between ECT 
and Aspect.
4.  Brant-Allen Industries:  Is shut down, more or less, for all financial 
trading.  They cannot enter into another derivative transactions with us, 
either on the phone or online, until, prior to entering into the trade, they 
provide us with a board resolution approving the trade or derivative trading 
in general.  The board resolution they provided with the signed master 
agreement only approved the one trade we entered into at that time.
5.  Cox & Perkins:    We had a master with this counterparty and they have 
informed us i writing that they didn't want to trade with us anymore.  In 
reality, if they did another trade, Legal will need to be contacted and we 
probably would try and reactive the master and roll the trade up under the 
master if possible.  Credit, keep us informed if they do trade.
6.  Sonoco Products:  We should not be trading with them at all until we 
resolve this payment dispute.  Sara Shackleton was working on that.  We do 
have a master with them, and if we resolve the payment dispute and begin 
trading with them, the trade should roll up under the existing master.

Elena,

The Phase 1 "invite" will presumably have a lot of the information defaulted 
(i.e. pre-printed on form) e.g. Counterparty Legal Name, yes?

Bob,

PA is Password Application Agreement, which is 1 page legal document that 
must be signed by the customer.
System Admin. in the other company may be a Trader as well, I assume, and in 
addition it depends on this company internal policy how they'll manage ETA 
acceptance process.... 

Thank you for your comments, decision about which alternative to choose for 
unknown customers has not been made yet .... Louise?

Re Marketing Pack, Rahil is working on it. 
David Port and Arfan are developing the forms. First draft of Customer 
Registration form is attached herewith.

Subject: Re: Registration Process Questions  

Elena,

Some queries/comments.

1. Existing Enron Customers (approx 2,000)

The first person from the customer's company logging Online has to accept 
ETA. After that ETA has to be available for viewing and printing for all 
other users.
The first person logging on will always be the Administrator (to set up his 
users) so how can a probable non-trading user accept ETAs for his traders?
PA = Password Application, right? Hadn't heard of this until now.


3. Unknown Customers (currently not trading with Enron) willing to get 
Trading Access
Alternative 1 most closely mirrors what we're doing for our existing customer 
base and so the procedures will already be in place for EOL Product Control / 
System Admin to run this. If the marketing pack mailing method is utilised we 
cut down on extra effort in a number of areas (marketing pack will be signed 
off by legal, business processes already there, no extra development effort, 
single point of reference).


Any chance of seeing what format the marketing pack / application is in so 
far? We'll need to make sure that the information we're requesting is 
comprehensive enough from a systems' perspective.

Thanks,

Bob

Subject: Registration Process Questions

Last two days showed that there is a big confusion on how exactly the 
registration process is going to work. The issue is very important and urgent 
as it may cause changes to the scope for Agency.com, and changes in the ETA 
and PA documents text.
 
The registration process appears to differ for different customer groups and, 
to my understanding, the latest was agreed as below. Please provide your 
comments or any corrections to the following:

1. Existing Enron Customers (approx 2,000)

will receive marketing Pack via mail approx. 2 weeks before the system goes 
live. The Marketing Pack will include PA (for an appropriate jurisdiction) 
and Registration Forms with questions about the customer (name, address, 
e-mail, taxable entity etc.) 
customers will fill in Registration Form, sign PA and mail it back to Enron
After the customer is approved for Online Trading by Enron, it will receive 
IDs and Passwords that customer's Administrator will grant to individual 
traders in that company
The first person from the customer's company logging Online has to accept 
ETA. After that ETA has to be available for viewing and printing for all 
other users.

Q:  Will PA be available as well as ETA for viewing and printing in the 
"House"?


2. Guest Users ( also referred to as Read Only Users) - Regulators, Lawyers, 
Brokers, Potential Traders etc.

will phone or sent e-mail (possibly fill in a form online, that will be 
automatically e-mailed) to Enron System Administrator. Customers will provide 
info on their name, e-mail address, mailing address, country of incorporation 
etc.
If Enron approves the customer as a Guest user, the System Administrator will 
e-mail customer Guest ID and Password.
When the customer logs in for the  first time as a guest, it'll  have to 
accept Read Only ETA on line. Read Only ETA will depend on the guest's place 
of incorporation, i.e. the system has to recognise the customer when it logs 
in and display an appropriate Read Only ETA. Without accepting Read Only ETA 
"Guest" user won't be able to view anything in the House.

Q:  1) Should Read Only ETA be printable and where?
 2) What limitations will be imposed on the Guest User, i.e. one log in 
session, limited time etc. - This decision has to be made in order for CC to 
put an appropriate language into the Read Only ETA. Read Only ETAs for all 
jurisdictions have to be finalised by July 7th.
 3) In the Garden there must be a sentence (to be drafted by CC) to inform 
potential Guest User that his request for Read Only access may not be granted.
 4) Is Read Only ETA accepted online or it should be signed and mailed back 
to Enron as a hard copy? The latest agreed was that it will be signed off 
line, but accepting it online should work as well, and seems to be a cleaner 
way...

3. Unknown Customers (currently not trading with Enron) willing to get 
Trading Access

There are two alternatives possible.
Alternative One: Off Line Registration

Potential Customer will e-mail, phone to express their willingness to trade 
online, i.e. get the ID and Password
Enron will mail Registration Pack to the Potential Customer with PA for 
appropriate jurisdiction
Customer will fill in Registration Form, sign PA and mail it back to Enron
If the customer is approved for Online Trading by Enron, it will receive IDs 
and Passwords that customer's Administrator will grant to individual traders 
in that company
The first person from the customer's company logging Online has to accept 
ETA. After that ETA has to be available for viewing and printing for all 
other users.

Alternative Two:  Partial OnLine Registration

Registration Pack including PAs for all jurisdictions will be available in 
the Garden
Customer has to chose (drop down box) which jurisdiction he is in,  print out 
appropriate Registration Pack and PA,  fill in Registration Form, sign PA and 
mail it to Enron
If the customer is approved for Online Trading by Enron, it will receive IDs 
and Passwords that customer's Administrator will grant to individual traders 
in that company
The first person from the customer's company logging Online has to accept 
ETA. After that ETA has to be available for viewing and printing for all 
other users.

Q:  1) Alternative 1 or 2?
 2) In the Garden there must be a sentence (to be drafted by CC) to inform 
potential customers that there request for Read Only access may not be 
granted.
 3) Should all ETAs and PAs be available and printable in the Garden? CC 
prefers them to be available...

Regards,
Elena

Dear Stacy,

Thanks for your note.  I've had a chat with Dave and Justin about your 
concerns. The issue we face is that the underlying legal structure of EOL, 
namely the Password Application and the Electronic Trading Agreement, always 
defines the Enron entity with which counterparty trades as "Enron", and 
similarly the counterparty is always "Counterparty".  Also, a trade that is 
entered into is defined as a "Transaction".  For this reason, we had ensured 
that the nomenclature in our GTCs, the market descriptions, and the EOL 
confirmations that we have drawn up, was conformed with the underlying 
structure.  If Mark or yourself  think that the US GTCs do not need to 
reflect this, please could you advise so that I can arrange for changes to 
the GTCs to be made.

Best regards,

 Edmund.

Subject: Re: U.S. Gas GTC's  

I have two concerns.

1)  Houston Pipe Line Company should not be referred to as Enron in the GTC.  
It should be referred to as "HPL".  It is fine for Enron North America Corp. 
to be referred to as Enron.

2)  The physical U.S. gas confirmation system does not use Counterparty.  It 
uses Customer.  If we change the GTC to read Counterparty it will not be 
consistent with the confirm that is issued to the Customer.  The U.S. gas GTC 
should not refer to Counterparty.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Stacy

Mark,

We have identified an issue in the UK whereby we could sell an Option for Q3 
(for example), which is really three 1-month options (July,Aug, Sept.). The 
option lanaguage needs to be clear that in the case of an option which has 
multiple election dates, the premium is paid up front for the set of options, 
but the payments which result from option settlement occur in each month 
during the option period.

Justin and Edmund have suggested the attached. Do you want to modify the U.S. 
product descriptions in a similar way?

Determination Period.
The term of the Transaction shall be from the Effective Date of 01 Apr 2000

located in the table "Product Price Assessments" and published under the 
headings "US Gulf Coast: Pipeline"

the volume shown shall be in total 
number of Barrels per month.

My only concern is that the Floating Price is the Index for the Determination

taking the average for the month?

As we discussed at our meeting, attached are preliminary drafts of an 
Internet Trading Access Agreement and an Electronic Trading Agreement.  The 
first Agreement is intended to be manually signed and reflects the 
Counterparty's agreement to be bound by the second agreement (and any other 
agreements posted on the website) through a "click" procedure.  The second 
agreement includes the reps and warranties, limitations on liability, etc. 
that Enron will need to obtain from the Counterparty.  I note that the only 
reason for bifurcating these into two Agreements is to keep the initial, 
manually executed agreement short and "user friendly".  It would be 
preferable, if you think it works from a business perspective, to have a 
single agreement, containing the provisions of both of these agreements, that 
is manually executed.  We should consider and discuss the feasibility of this 
approach.

Finally, please note that the Agreements reference procedures to be included 
on the website.  These procedures will include the actual mechanics of 
trading, which the Counterparty will have to agree to but which need not (but 
of course can be) included in the agreements directly.

Please let us know if you have any problem opening the documents.  We look 
forward to discussing these issues with you further.

[This is a message I sent internally to all V&E lawyers.  I know there is a
lot in here that some of you already know about, but I thought I'd share it
with you.  Except for the clearing organization rules, which appear to me to
be a mess, I think this should make life simpler for Sara and Jim in dealing
with equity derivatives, for Mark Taylor, Sara and others in dealing with
principal-to-principal negotiated commodity derivatives, and perhaps for
EnronOnline.  Nora, this will no doubt pose some interesting questions
relative to DealBench.  And, of course, if and to the extent that Enron
wants to set up or otherwise get involved in multiple participant B2B
Internet trading sites that involve transactions that will be completed
on-line, there will be some issues that need to be addressed.]

This should be viewed as a very preliminary report because I have not had a
chance to study the new rules carefully.  I will send more complete
information later.

Last week the Commodities Futures Trading Commission adopted its "new
regulatory framework," a series of rules that I believe will greatly expand
the breadth, depth, height, weight and size of the CFTC's bureaucracy  and
the scope of the CFTC's regulatory involvement in all sorts of things
(including financial guarantees) that it has not attempted to regulate
heretofore.  The CFTC described this rule making as a "regulatory
reinvention." Indeed, the CFTC has reinvented itself without Congressional
authorization to do so.  In particular, under the new rules, for the first
time the CFTC's "board of trade" regulation is not confined to markets in
which "speculators" participate.  In effect, it has extended its "board of
trade" regulatory reach into a portion of the over-the-counter market that
involves only business participants.

Probably the biggest headache for all of us will be the new rules relating
to Clearing Organizations, defined as "a person who provides credit
enhancement functions" with respect to certain transactions, including
transactions that rely on the new bilateral contract exemption discussed
below.  In many cases it will be illegal for a company that does not
register with and become regulated by the CFTC as a Recognized Clearing
Organization (RCO) to provide credit enhancement functions.  I obviously
need to study the rules further, but my initial read is that the rules are a
disaster in drafting.  For example, I don't think that the CFTC intended to
say that a parent company cannot guarantee a swap entered into by its
subsidiary unless the parent company registers as an RCO, but on my initial
reading it appears to me that the rule is not at all clear and could be read
that way.  So if you are working on any transaction that involves a
guarantee of a swap or other transaction that is exempt under the new
exemption for bilateral contracts, you need to run this issue to ground
before you close.  The rules don't become effective, however, until 60 days
after they are published in the Federal Register.

There are some good things about the new rules.  The new exemption for
bilateral contracts greatly liberalizes the swaps exemption and expands it
so that it covers contracts other than swaps.  It provides greater certainty
regarding the enforceability of derivatives and, in most cases, of contracts
for physical delivery of commodities.

The bilateral contracts exemption, however, is unavailable for contracts
entered into through "Multiple Transaction Execution Facilities" or MTEFs.
Multiple participant B2B Internet trading sites will be classified as MTEFs,
unless participants are required to go off-line to complete the contracts
(as, for example, CheMatch requires its participants to do). Under the new
rules, multiple participant B2B Internet trading sites that involve swaps
and other derivative contracts completed on-line must submit themselves to
CFTC regulation as "Derivatives Transaction Facilities" or DTFs.  Moreover,
an MTEF that trades only in physical delivery contracts can achieve contract
enforcement certainty of the type offered by the exemption for bilateral
contracts only if it submits itself to regulation as a DTF.  The MTEF
definition excludes any Internet trading site, such as EnronOnline, that
involves a single party offering to enter into trades with multiple parties,
and therefore the sponsor of such a site can take advantage of the exemption
for bilateral contracts without submitting itself to CFTC regulation.  DTFs
must not permit any person other than an "eligible commercial participant"
to trade.  The term "eligible commercial participant" is defined in the rule
and includes, generally, commercial counterparties and financial
intermediaries.

  Although the CFTC promises that its regulation of DTFs will be more
light handed that that historically applied to U.S. futures exchanges, the
new regulatory framework is likely to result in significant regulatory
oversight of multiple participant B2B Internet trading sites that register
as DTFs.  Under the new rules, each sponsor must determine whether to
restrict trading on its site to avoid CFTC regulation or to submit to
regulation.

As a result of a smooth launch and market demand, we are accelerating the 
timetable for the launch of several EnronOnline products.

Specifically,  after the launch of U.S. power on Monday, Dec. 13th, we will 
be launching the following:

Wednesday, December 15: US Coal, U.S. Plastics, US Pulp and Paper
Thursday, December 16: Norwegian Power

Although the legal review has been completed for all of the above, I would 
appreciate it if you would look once more at the products which are relevant 
to your area and confirm that you are happy with them (some of you are 
already in the process of doing so - thank you)

We absolutely want to avoid making changes after launch due to the problems 
associated with changing descriptions on products which have already traded.

The Product Long Descriptions can be seen in the Product Manager by expanding 
the Product Type in the tree to show each of the dependent Products, then 
right-clicking the Product, selecting View and then pressing the View 
Description button which appears on the pop-up window.

Please contact myself or Dale Neuner if you have any comments.

Thanks,

Dave

Tana,

State of incorporation has been captured for a large number of the 
counterparties and has been used as the basis for the determination of 
financial trading status by our tax group.

If we are going to prevent a utility/gov/pension fund from trading financial 
products because of state law and we have state of incorporation, we should 
ensure that the entity we are barring is at least in the same state as the 
law in question.

If this has not been the case, one way to update the information would be to 
list the states which have restrictive legislation and then apply the list to 
the companies for which we have state of incorporation information. An Excel 
Vlookup would accomplish this quite quickly. This is not perfect, but would 
at least ensure that utilities in states without the legislation are not 
barred - although I recognize it might bar some companies in states where the 
legislation may be so specific as not to preclude the trading of financial 
products for some utilities under certain circumstances.

Frank: Could you please forward an updated list of state of incorporation 
information to Tana?

One last point (thanks, Bob): If a particular state has restrictive 
legislation, is it our obligation to prevent the utility from trading 
financial products, or does the obligation rest with the utility? i.e. is 
there any reason for us to be barring them, or can we simply give them the 
ability to transact financial products with EnronOnline and rely on their 
internal controls? If we don't have any legal obligation to police, I'm 
reluctant to do anything which would imply we are assuming this 
responsibility.

Mark: Can you comment on this last point?

Thanks,

Dave

Subject: Re: State of Incorporation  

Our review of the counterparty list is not considering, for the most part, 
state of incorporation.  The biggest consideration with derivatives is the 
country of incorporation (and additionally, the country(ies) in which trading 
will take place).  For the bulk of our swap counterparties, i.e. energy 
companies, state law currently isn't an in issue on approval of swap 
trading.  It is more of an issues with governmentals, utilities, insurance 
companies, pension funds and the like, and we do not capture that information 
until we are in active neogtiation with a counterparty.  With utilities, you 
cannot make a general assumption that any particular state law that applies 
to one utility will apply to another.  Each utility need to be looked at 
individually to see which state or federal law may apply to that counterparty.

The bulk of you customer list is not financial counterparties we are in 
active negotiation with, so we are not capturing state of incorporation.  I 
know the Global Contracts Group has been trying to capture that information.  
You may want to talk to Mary Gosnell.

Sorry for the delay. I have been out of the office for few days.  Anyway 
attached is the request for advice. Hope it is of some help.I also enclosed 
the file note that I produced after our discussion last month. That proved 
very useful in focusing counsel in on the relevant issues.

David - 

I am putting together the request for assistance from local counsel in Japan 
in preparation for opening up EnronOnline to Japanese counterparties.  If you 
have a copy of the request you sent to MSJ when you started working on this 
for Australia it would be very helpful to me.  I have what we've used in 
Europe but would be grateful for your thoughts as well.

Thanks,

My understanding ( as of last week) was that trades done Online were binding 
to the counterparty holding the ID under which the trade was transacted, and 
that confirms (if needed) would we done in that name. A follow up procedure 
was discussed for written assignment to the "correct" counterparty.  This was 
not the case yesterday, where the deal was changed internally to the 
"correct" counterparty without a written assignment.

Mark, Jeff, please comment on the the legal aspects of doing these moves 
internally without a written assignment. Does a verbal OK from each 
counterparty (assignor and assignee)  suffice?

Thanks,

Debbie

Subject: Aquila

We need to know what the resolution plan is to getting Aquilia straight for 
trading Physical and Financial products.   Today we saw Aquilia Risk trade 
Next Day Physical Gas again and we were asked to move the deal to Aquilia 
Energy.  What is being done to get Aquilia Risk from continuing to enter 
Physical trades on line?  My concern for this trade was that we brought it to 
Credit's attention this morning and did not get final word to move the deal 
to Aquilia Energy until late in the day (4.45pm) which affects Logistics 
ability to nominate for next day business.  Logistics has been made aware of 
the late nom and will be working with the Pipe to get the nom in.  If there 
are issues with this late nom from the pipeline we will let you know.

I'm not comfortable with the internal process of  counterparty name changing 
of EOL deals and would like to get comfortable with how we are going to set 
this process up.  I think there should be legal review of all deals that we 
change and would suspect that some form of communication would need to be 
conveyed to the counterparty.

Mark,
This is a FYI:

I ran across a Terms of Use Statement which is likely similar to what we may 
need as part of our Enron customer internet site.  The statement is actually 
part of Coral Energy's website.  You can access the terms of use statement by 
going to the link below:

https://www.coralconnect.com/legal/TermsOfUse.asp

Let me know how things are going on the review and if I can be of assistance.

Mark, you may recall my memo to you in April, 1999 which indicated that for 
netting purposes, the conditions included:

1.  The transaction must be governed by a market standard master agreement or 
occur on a French regulated market

2.  One of the parties must be (a) an "investment firm" within the meaning of 
the law of 2nd of July, 1996, (b) an instituion or firm benefitting from the 
provisions of article 25 of the Law or (c) a non-resident entity having a 
"comparable status"

The term "investment firm" embodies financial type institutions which recieve 
and transmit order for financial instruments for third parties.

There are 12 categories of article 25 firms (including Bank of France, 
insurance companies, broker types, etc.)  .For example, one murky designation 
includes "persons who supply an investment service which is ancillary to 
their professional activity, provided the rules governing such activity do 
not prohibt the carrying on of investment services".  Slaughter and May has 
advised that they could assist us in determining whether our French 
counterparty fit this category and it definitely needs to be discussed with 
the counterparty (and extract a rep from them as well).  There are other 
categories as well.   I have a copy of the law if you would like to review.

The non-resident entity having "comparable status" is the category WE were 
trying for fit into without much success.

Tana tells me that I have given you misinformation.  Perhaps the law has 
changed and Justin has a recent update.  

ENA has a Soc Gen master, and we have recently sent a Deemed ISDA to a French 
corporate (one shot deal only).

David,

Further to your earlier email I am pleased to attach the following documents 
for you to draw up blacklined versions of the US versions of the PA and ETA 
you distributed earlier:

PA- version 9 that was sent to Enron on 20 July 1999, version 10
incorporating comments from the meeting between Clifford Chance and Justin 
Boyd and myself, and a mark up showing
the changes between the two.

ETA- version 7 that was sent to Enron on 20 July 1999, version 8
incorporating comments from the meeting between Clifford Chance and Justin 
Boyd and myself, and a mark up showing
the changes between the two.

Please use version 10 of the PA and version 8 of the ETA for your blackline 
for us.

Please let me know if you need an alternate format of document for your 
computer systems.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards, Edmund.

2) AGENCY.COM should immediately send the 'softlaunch' invoice
representing T&M fees plus Jessica licensing fees to Jay and Enron will
process it for payment promptly.
3) AGENCY.COM will create an 'softlaunch' acceptance letter that will
include a statement indicating that both parties agree that the penalty
is set at 12.5%. This letter should be signed by both Paul and Jay.
4) Enron wants to set up a seperate maintenance and support effort for
Post-release activities. Paul and Jay will work to define this
engagement. The penalty will not apply to this engagement.

A sincere thank you for reaching an agreement on this in a simple,
straight-forward manner. I do appreciate it.

Dave

Louise,

Thank you for the below email.  It is good to clear up the confusion
regarding this process.  At the end of the email you ask for our comments on
the ROETA execution process.

We would prefer that the ROETA be executed off-line.  It is on that basis
that we have sought the opinion of overseas counsel.  That said, you may
form the view that online execution of the ROETA is no different to the
operation of a website with a hotlinked disclaimer.  On that basis you may
decide to execute the ROETA online.  We have some concerns regarding
security issues because of the distribution of a password without a
supporting agreement, however, you may form the view that this is a minor
risk.

If you have any other questions, please do not hesitate contact me.

Regards

Timothy Hughes

Subject: Legal Meeting - 8 June 1999

Dear all,

these are the issues from the last legal meeting that need further attention:

1). European Jurisdictions Peculiarities 
Slovenia, Cpoatia, Romania must be added to Phase 1 reviews. Products that  
considered are gas and power both physical and financial. 15 Jurisdictions 
reviews are already received. So far they do not reveal any fundamental 
problems with the overall structure. There are few recommendations on the 
wording of PAA, ETA and GTC to come. CC (Tim Hueges) is summarising all the 
replies and will forward a list of problematic issues for each jurisdictions 
by Monday (14th) lunch time. 

Possible complications are:

 All documents for French and Spanish customers may need translation into 
French and Spanish, as part of these  jurisdictions requirements.

 Sweden and Italy have particularly strict regulations on checking  validity 
of signatures => it may need to be reflected in the business processes.

It was suggested to have PAA on the screen as well, so that potential 
customers may print them out, fill in and mail to Enron. YES - only in the 
garden and we will need clear instrucutions on how to register there also 

2). Read Only Access for some customers
instead of ETA read only customers have to click on Read Only Agreement, 
therefor it has to be drafted ASAP. DRAFTING REQUIRED. THIS IS ALSO A SYSTEM 
REQUIREMENT FOR READ ONLY.

3). Product Descriptions
A decision was made that they will be reviewed by internal legal team (Justin 
Boyd, Mark Taylor) but not CC or S&C. OK

4). Timetable 
GTCs in English should be finalised by the end of June.  First two weeks of 
July CC will spend validating marketing data.  Project timetable was promised 
to CC to be e-mailed yesterday.  OK, but timings will vary on the basis of 
what timetable says.

5). Translation
Translation of GTCs, ETA and PPA will be done internally . The first priority 
languages most likely will be French, German and Spanish. 
Actions:

Translations of those GTCs that we already have must be started ASAP (Justin 
Boyd to co-ordinate). 

Identify languages to  translate into (Elena Kapralova to co-ordinate with 
Justin and traders)

6). Taxes
Questionnaires similar to the one that was sent to European jurisdictions 
must be sent to Canada (Janine Juggins to co-ordinate).

7). Web Page Wording
The words "I accept" and "Delete" in the box that appears after a customer 
clicked on price, are to be changed into "Submit" and "Clear". Lawyers are 
comfortable with this.

8). Different Entities on Counterparty Side
If there are a few different entities trading for the same company,  for ex. 
Morgan Stanley International (MSI) and Morgan Stanley (MS), they should be 
treated in the system as two separate clients and be granted two separate 
System Administrator passwords. This is necessary for tax considerations. It 
is confirmed once again that there will be one ETA acceptance click per 
System Administrator.

9). Authorisation Risk 
Because Online Trading will be Enron's software, all problems arising from 
authorisation errors, for ex.  when customer that was supposedly authorised 
to trade only UK Gas was able to trade power, will be entirely Enron's 
liability => it highlights again an importance of very thorough testing of 
authorisation functionality of the system in July and August.NO this would 
only be the case if we reverted to asking them what they wanted to trade and 
we are not going to do that from a systems process point of view - DAVID _ 
ISSUE

10). Written and Electronic Confirmations
It appears to be a difference between UK and US practices in treating 
superiority of written vs. electronic confirmations. According to the UK law, 
an electronic confirmation will overwrite a paper one, generated and mailed 
by the Back Office, similar to the current practice for transactions done 
over the telephone, when phone conversation overwrites all paper 
conformations. In the US the situation is opposite. For the deals done over 
the phone, written confirmations still take priority over the phone 
conversation tape. In Texas anything that is not in writing, is not 
enforceable.  

The situation with priority of confirmations of Online trades in US must be 
investigated further (Mark Taylor to co-ordinate). The result should be 
reflected in US version of  ETA. YES

This leads to a further question, whether sending written confirmations in UK 
is still necessary?YES

11). UN E-Commerce Directive
There is a daft of UN Directive on e-commerce, which currently has very 
strict rules regarding time when transaction is considered complete. It 
requires mutual exchange of written confirmations etc. Enron might be in 
position to lobby few items in this Directive (Justin and Regulatory Dept.) 
What th eEU piece asks for is mutual confirmations by clicking - two further 
stages than we have in our system.  WE need to build a system which can 
incorporate these changes at some point in the furture but not now.

12). Suspending Trades by Counterparty
A few traders are very keen on being able to suspend trades by counterparty, 
for instance in a situation when they see a counterparty making a number of 
deals in the same commodity. It arises two issues:
IT -  the system should be able to put a name of the counterparty on the 
transaction summary page (bottom of the price page) YES 

Legal - CC has to investigate and give a view whether it is permitted by law. 
NO PROBLEM - BUILD SYSTEM NOW TO DO THIS.


Price Check Idea 
Just a thought, whether  it is technically possible to amend a price check 
(the one done when the customer submitted a price, and database does credit, 
GTC and price check) in a way that customer is notified about the price 
change not for all changes but only when the price has moved against Enron, 
i.e. if price moved in Enron's  favour transaction should go forward at the 
price customer had agreed to earlier. Legally it is OK. Jay, can the system 
do it? YES

Internal Issues still to be addressed:

1). Global Liquids Books management, i.e. how responsibilities for price 
update will be managed  between London and Houston desks.DAVID
2). FX conversion including IT, business processes, tax, risk managment 
issues (David Port, Janine Juggins, Jay Webb)DAVID

All comments are welcome,
Regards,
Elena

Attached is the new site map file for auctions. It has been modified to 
reflect the ordering of the global nav and the removal of the ATA, which is 
no longer needed.

The View/Accept Contract screen will contain text cut which is currently in 
the About Storage Services section (I will modify the text file accordingly 
when received from Haakon).

Note that we are planning on using the same template as represented by the 
Market Info. screen in EnronOnline, although there will be a unique set of 
graphics for each of:

1) The Auctions Home Page
2) All of the EnBank pages (which will share the same graphic treatment, with 
appropriate title amendments).

Mark:

Steve Kean has asked if we should send EnronOnline brochures to the various 
poicy makers in D.C.  As we discussed earlier, you did not want this to occur 
until our electronic trading business was up and running.   Please let me 
know when you think we should be able to brief policy makers, if at all.   In 
any case, I'd certainly like to have some brochures on hand to be able to 
answer any questions we get about the product.

An update on Blackbird and the situation regarding scrutiny of their 
electronic trading product ....fortunately there was no correspondence 
generated from Capitol Hill (Combest or Ewing) asking the CFTC to look more 
closely at Blackbird's product or electronic trading in general.   Upon 
checking with Committee folks, they were satisfied that Blackbird has been 
fairly straighforward in having an open dialogue with the CFTC....Blackbird 
has met with some of the Commissioners already and is meeting with Rainer 
today to walk them through the product and show why its not something that 
should be treated as an exchange.

Also FYI, Ewing's staff director at the subcommittee, Stacey Carey, is now 
working for ISDA as a government affairs person.  This should bode fairly 
positively for Ewing's awareness and position on OTC derivatives issues, 
although she is precluded by ethics rules from lobbying the subcommittee or 
Ewing for 1 year.

I understand you indicated to Louise Kitchen the other day that you may wish 
to provide a list of contacts to receive brochures about EnronOnline.

Could you please confirm if you wish to do this, and if so, send me the list 
so I can ensure that it is included in the mailing?

Thanks,

Dear All,

Following Mark's and David's request for the due diligence questionnaires 
that we have used in Europe for EOL, I am pleased to attach the following:

1. Questionnaire regarding internet trading
2. Questionnaire regarding commodity derivatives trading




A couple of points I'd like to make:

- the internet questionnaire refers to the European Economic Area "passport" 
(entitling you to trade in one EEA country by vitue of being regulated by 
another EEA country). Obviously this is not appropriate for S. America or 
Oceania and Asia. It is possible that you have some similar mechanism.
- the energy commodity questionnaire considers commodity derivatives trading. 
This questionniare was only sent to local counsel in jurisdictions for which 
we had not already undertaken derivatives due diligence.  In respect of 
physical commodity trading, based on the due diligence we have done to date 
in Europe, we have not undertaken any further due diligence for trading via 
EOL. If you feel that you need to undertake any physical trading due 
diligence, we have a set of questionnaires which I would be happy to pass on 
to you to use as you see fit.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any queries or questions about any 
of the above - otherwise, happy hunting!

Best regards, Edmund.

Can you guys please send over a copy of the questions that were submitted to

it for Australia and Louise has asked me to deal with Columbia.

Thanks,

Thanlks for this.  I'm forwarding it to the others in the group who are 
working on this project.  We're meeting on Wednesday to discuss the GTCs 
we'll use for physical products transactions.

In our world, we use the same approach used in the financial trading world. 
so that silence is deemed acceptance.  That doesn't work under English law, 
by the way, where silence does NOT mean acceptance.  I still don't understand 
how we're going to deal w/ a counterparty that deals w/ us in London and 
wants to sit in London but trade off hte U.S. screens.  Apart from tax 
concerns, how do we structure those agreements?  This draft  ETA uses the 
concept of "group undertakings", which I've not heard before, but does that 
solve or create a problem in the scenario I describe?

Subject: Revised documentation

I think this is the most recent version of the ETA.  Obviously, this is the 
UK version and Sullivan & Cromwell are turning it into a US document.  The US 
version will be governed by NY law and contain an arbitration clause.  We're 
also trying to figure out how much to say about the confirmation process 
since it may vary from product to product and will almost certainly be 
different from the UK version.  Speaking of which, I was surprised to find 
that they have the telephone conversation (and in this case the web site 
records) control over a confirmation which has been signed by both parties.  
What's the practice in your part of the world?  One alternative is to insert 
the language (or something like it) that we use in financial trading which 
says that we will send a written confirm, gives the counterparty a short time 
(2 or 3 days) to respond and indicates that silence will be deemed 
acceptance.  Would that work for your deals?

Anyway, I'm in NY today and tomorrow, back in the office on Wed.  Louise is 
insistent that the GTC's be available to be uploaded this weekend.  I'll be 
calling in periodically tomorrow and will try to get you since I'm sure you 
will have issues to discuss - and now is the right time to get changes made 
to the ETA if necessary.

FROM:  Andrew Wilkinson

Dear Mark

Further to my various emails on Friday 16 July 1999, please find attached a
copy of the UK ETA which shows the amendments from the drafts I sent to you
on Friday.  All of these changes have been inserted into all Electronic
Trading Agreements for each of the primary jurisdictions.  These changes
have been made following my conference call with Scott Sefton, Justin Boyd,
Louise Kitchen and others yesterday afternoon.

I also attach a revised draft of the UK Gas Physical Beach GTC and the
Zeebrugge Gas Physical GTC marked up to show the changes to the versions
sent to you last Friday.

I would be grateful for any comments on these documents as well as those
sent to you on Friday.

Kind regards.

Mark,

Please call me re: verbatim use of wording between EOL and Confirms.

Also:

PCGs are checking back with confirms people regarding index descriptions and 
location, to make sure things are properly covered off. They are also going 
through the descriptions to identify cases where traders have grabbed 
incorrect items against the products they have created. Additional system 
controls are going in today and into next week to stop this sort of error 
from happening.

I thought it prudent to invest approx. US$1000 and register "EnronOnline" as 
a trademark in Australia. My preference would be for Enron Australia Pty. 
Ltd. to  register the trademark. But I note that the Enron logo is registered 
in the name of Enron Corp. I assume this was done prior to the incorporation 
of any Enron companies in Australia. Do you know of any practice (I couldn't 
find a policy) to register trademarks in any particular Enron body corporate?

I did over-simplify the North America organization a bit.  There is also Kim 
Theriot for NA Power and Cindy Horn or someone else under Kevin Sweeney for 
Global Products.  I think because of the exposure and amount of interfacing 
involved here, I would prefer to have a Manager act as your contact.  How 
about Connie Sutton ?

We try to keep each other informed as to issues and current projects and 
coordinate our activities since we use the same systems and databases.   
However, we are distinct organizations working to support the Operations 
functions at our individual locations.  Therefore, you will need to send the 
new GTCs to each designated individual for each location.  If it would be 
easier for you to coordinate with only one Contracts support person and have 
us share information between us, we can do that - just let us know how you 
would like to proceed.  We are all working hard to ensure your implementation 
of EOL is a success.  To do this, we need to have information as soon as you 
can provide it.  Thanks in advance for your cooperation and support of our

Subject: Re: OnLine GTC's  

Karen,

Thank you for your email. I'm surprised you are having difficulty obtaining 
current information from me, as your email attached below postdated both my 
conversation with Philippe Travis in which he explained that GCD would like 
copies of the contracts, and the email sent to him which contained GTC's.

After speaking with Philippe, I asked Edmund Cooper, who works with Justin 
Boyd in our legal dept and who had supplied the previous email containing 
GTC's, to continue to forward EnronOnline copies as required. To my 
knowledge, this has been done.

If you are still having difficulties obtaining copies, please let me know. I 
can be contacted in Houston at 31861 and will be arriving there Thursday 
afternoon.

Thanks,

Dave

Mark Taylor (EOL counsel) requested that I coordinate directly with you 
because you are the point person gathering a complete set of OnLine GTC's.  
Please let me know when I can expect current information regarding the US and 
Canadian OnLine GTC's.

Because we could not obtain current information from you, Philippe (our 
Global Contracts database contact in London)  has, at my request, gathered 
information regarding the European OnLine GTC's from his contacts in 
London.   I am not aware of who "Justin" is.  Can you provide me with a last 
name? 

We still need the information regarding US and Canadian OnLine GTC's.  

Thank you,
Karen

Bob,

Do you know Karen Lambert and why she needs a set of GTC's for the 
implementation of EOL?

I believe Philippe Travis of the GCD group has been working with Justin to 
collect contract info.

Subject: Proposed new Index



Index:  Gas Daily WAHA
Abbreviation: Waha
Sort Code: 3530


The Index for a calendar day shall be the average of the Daily Midpoint 
prices published for such calendar day under the heading "Daily Price Survey" 
in the Permian Basin Area: Tex intras, Waha area section of Gas Daily, or if 
a calendar day is not a Business Day then the price for such calendar day 
will be the [average of the Common High and Common Low] DAILY MIDPOINT price 
published on the next succeeding Business Day.

Should the word "area" after "Waha" be capitalized? It's not capitalized in 
the Gas Daily publication - so to consistent with the publication I did not 
capitalize.
On some Gas Daily products we are switching to the Gas Daily posted average - 
is this one of those?  Bob Bowen has been looking into this also. See above.

Mark,

Jennifer (PCG) has supplied me with example language from the confirmations 
which is representative of the the other confirmations. I agreed that you and 
I would rework a couple of examples for her, and then she can apply the same 
principles to the remaining descriptions.

I think the best way to proceed on this is if we work up example wording for 
most of the different publication types, and/or verify any wording suggested 
by Jennifer against the original confirm language.

I will bring up the originals to you, but my suggestion for a rework is:


Daily price midpoint example (For Gas Daily, Oklahoma-PEPL):

The Index shall be the Daily Midpoint price published on each calendar day 
during the term of the transaction under the heading "Daily Price Survey" in 
the Oklahoma - PEPL section of Gas Daily, or if a calendar day is not a 
business day then the price used shall be the Daily Midpoint price published 
on the next succeeding business day.


Monthly price example (For NGI, Northern California Border):

The Index shall be the "Bidweek Average" price for the Northern Cal Border 
Average as listed in the table entitled "California Border & Non-Utility 
End-User Citygate tables", published in the first issue in each month of 
Natural Gas Intelligence Weekly Gas Price Index for the term of the 
transaction.


Monthly price example (For Inside Ferc, Texas,Oklahoma PEPL)

The Index shall be the Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co - Texas, Oklahoma 
(mainline) price as listed in the section entitled "Prices of Spot Gas 
Delivered to Pipelines", published in the first issue in each month of Inside 
Ferc's Gas Market Report for the term of the transaction.


In each of the above examples, PCG will need to substitute the price name and 
section name for each of the applicable prices in each purblication.


Dave

Good morning everyone,

Thankyou for responding promptly.

I think this draft better captures the Master / GTC approach though I thought 
we were going to change the title of the Internete Trading Access Agreement 
to something reflecting 'Password Application'.  

Also the wording which has been added at the end of the agreement is 
obviously only US specific - does this mean that we are going to have to have 
different Agreements on the page depending on the location of the person who 
clicks on it? Obviously the fact that the law is different on the written one 
is OK as can be altered by jurisdiction but the same issue does arise on the 
online agreement.   This causes issues so I'll need a respond immediately on 
this and would appreciate Mark and Justin discussing this today.

For information, I attach Schwab's agreement from the web which is quite 
simplistic in look and feel - could we adopt any of this approach - no 
WHEREAS is a good start.




Regards

Louise

Attached are the revised online GTC's.  The weather GTC's won't change except 
for the credit support language, so I thought that you could make that same 
change when you made it to the rest of the GTC's.

Louise

This isn't quite how I recall it looking yesterday. If my memory serves me
well, your sketch showed - all in one line:

"You want to buy 20000 from Enron"

What you have sent today shows:

"You want to buy 20000...
[product short description]
from Enron for 2.18"

To me, this is less clear. Would it not be simpler, and completely
unambiguous, to state:

"You want to buy from Enron 20000
[product short description]
for 2.18"

Similarly, "You want to sell to Enron 20000
[product short description]
for 2.18"

Regards

Subject: Internet Trading - Internet Trading Access and Electronic Trading  
Agreements




Further to our meeting yesterday, please find attached a copy of the
Internet Trading Access Agreement ("ITAA") and the Electronic Trading
Agreement ("ETA") marked up with my suggested changes from an English law
perspective.  As I mentioned to you yesterday, these documents will also
need to be considered by the overseas lawyers to see whether there are any
overriding local laws which could impact on the use.  The overseas lawyers
have copies of these agreements and will include this in their report.

I understand that it is envisaged that the ITAA will be signed off line and
the ETA will be posted on the Website.  Each person authorised by a
counterparty with a password must "click through" the Agreement before
commencing trading.  This will only be done on one occasion.

We discussed yesterday the risks associated with this approach, namely, that
a counterparty could claim that at the time of entering into the ITAA it was
not aware of the terms of the ETA and therefore, could not be bound by it.
It is clearly important to have certainty that the terms of the ETA are
enforceable as they contain important terms such as indemnities, limitations
of liability etc.  Having said that, the view might be taken that by
entering into the ITAA all that has been achieved is that a counterparty
receives a password which enable the counterparty to put itself in a
position where it must consider the ETA before proceeding.  Once the
counterparty accesses the Website and sees the ETA a second contract is made
and the ITAA and ETA must then be read together but only at the time that
the counterparty has clicked through the ETA.  I suspect that this is the
approach that Sullivan & Cromwell had in mind.  It is also worth bearing in
mind that a counterparty may ask for the ETA at the time of entering into
the ITAA or may be relunctant to click through the ETA until they have had
internal legal sign off.  This may delay trading.

Nonetheless, I understand that you are keen to proceed with signing the ITAA
off line and the ETA on line and accordingly, the attached documents are
marked up with that structure in mind.  As agreed yesterday, I have only
made changes to the document produced by Sullivan & Cromwell where I think
it is necessary for English law purposes or clarification.  I have the
following brief comments on the changes I have made:

1. Parties:  You will see that both documents are entered into by a
designated
 Enron entity for itself and on behalf of all Enron group
undertakings.  The reason
 for this is that Transactions will actually be made between the
counterparty and
 various different Enron entities.  We therefore need to ensure that
such Transactions
 with each of those Enron entities are governed by the terms of these
documents.
 I note from your e-mail yesterday that it was suggested that we need
to list the affiliates
 or have one entity enter into the Transactions.  I think there may
be some confusion here.
 This is not the case.  I assume that the current Enron entities
which trade certain
 commodities with certain counterparties will continue to do so on
the Website.
 The Website will need to be set up in such a way as to achieve this
but I assume that this
 causes no problem as each counterparty will see different pages on
the Website depending
 on what password has been inserted.  The documents now contemplate
this.

2. "Services":  I have removed the references to Services as I am not
sure what this means.
 I would have thought that these agreements need to govern the
counterparty's access and
 utilization of the Website whether or not they actually carry out
any Transactions.  Therefore,
 I believe that where the Agreement had previously referred to
Services, it can now refer to
 "access and utilization of" the Website.

3. Contract Formation:  I have inserted a short paragraph in Clause 3
of the ETA which
 provides that a Transaction will only be executed once Enron
generates a message of
 confirmation of the sale and purchase to a Counterparty and that any
electronic records
 of Enron will prevail.  I note that Sullivan & Cromwell envisage a
document being attached
 which explains this.  This is also acceptable.

4. Data Protection:  On reflection, it will be more appropriate for
relevant data protection
 wording to be on the Website itself rather than in the ITAA or ETA.
This is because the
 data protection concerns revolve around data subjects i.e. living
individuals, rather than
 corporate entities such as the Counterparty.  Before providing
appropriate wording for
 this, could you please let me know what information will be
collected by you concerning
 living individuals either intentionally or unintentionally.  For
example, when a password is
 entered will you be able to identify a living individual by this or
can you intentionally or
 unintentionally obtain that individual's e-mail address or other
information on them once
 they have entered the Site.  You will need to check this with your
technical people.

Once you have had a chance to review this perhaps you could let me have your
comments.

I have simultaneously sent this e-mail to my financial regulatory colleagues
for their review.  They may have further comments which we will send onto
you as a matter of urgency.

Kind regards

Andrew Wilkinson

Fascinating.

A few questions come to mind:

1) Has an auction transaction agreement been developed? 

2) Harry, have we checked with Mark Perlis yet on any emission legal issues, 
such as can we offer an auction that competes arguable with the EPA Auction?

3) It appears as though this is going to be both a system that allows Enron 
to buy and sell with other participants, as well as allows others to deal 
with each other through the system.  I would be my understanding that only 
physical delivery would occur in this market. Mark, do you think this 
(particularly the matching aspects of the auction) may be construed as a 
"multilateral execution facility" by the CFTC? I could not recall if that 
interpretation would be a problem for a physical delivery market; I know it 
would likely be for swaps.

4) Does Enron get any commission for playing running the system when others 
transaction without Enron being a principal?

5) I have no idea about the legality of offering up the Las Vegas trip. But, 
it seems as though we would need to review all relevant jurisdictions where 
the participants reside for an answer.

Harry:

Attatched is a document containg the basic structure of the auction as we 
envision it. Please keep in mind that it is a work in progress and will be 
modified as we develop a better idea of the auction.
Below are certain questions we need clarification on.

Structure:
Do we have any CFTC exposure?
By the nature of the auction structure, are we not implicitly matching? If 
yes then how does this affect the previous answer?
Do we have exposure to the lottery commission if we offer a free gift during 
the auction?

Contract:
To limit our exposure due to failure of the system etc. what sort of Force 
Majure clause can we incorporate in the contract?
To what extent are electronically signed contracts enforceable?

Internal:
Can other trading desks at Enron other than the emissions desk participate in 
this auction?
What limitations can be placed on the emissions desk as far as information 
sharing and usage are concerned? both during and after the auction?


Thank You

Zal

Subject: Cutoff Time for EOL Gas Transactions

I talked to each of you a couple of weeks ago, and this topic got pushed 
aside due to some other pressing issues.  However, each of you agreed that a 
standard cutoff time was acceptable for US gas, power and liquids products.  

The best option will be to agree to cutoff at 4pm each day (just to get an 
idea of the numbers we were talking about, I looked at yesterday to determine 
how many deals were traded after 4pm Houston time.  We had three US Gas 
deals, and two Canadian Gas deals).  After 4pm, the bridges would 
automatically roll new EOL deals to the next day.  However, for those deals 
that do not bridge after 4pm, the various risk groups would need to remember 
that these deals are the following day's business.  I am not sure how the 
procedures in Risk would need to be modified for the trader's position 
reports, as the official books would not include these late deals.  Can Risk 
run supplemental reports to ensure that the desks have accurate positions 
each morning?   

I would appreciate any comments that you may have, and regardless, please 
re-confirm that a cutoff of 4pm works for each of your respective groups.

I think Jeff like myself has been out of the office so I am responding from 
the US tax side. Jeff please correct the following as appropriate.

When the US tax group reviewed the original matrix they identified 
counterparties as being unable to trade US financials where those parties 1) 
were not incorporated in the US, and 2) there was no US withholding tax 
documentation on file. Where on the matrix it was not clear where an entity 
was incorporated it was assumed for this purpose NOT to have been 
incorporated in the US.

Thus if the review establishes that in fact some of these entities are 
incorporated in the US, the prohibition on these entities trading US 
financials can be lifted.

Jeff was in the process of reviewing the matrix.

Janine

For U.S. based counterparties, State of Incorporation is fairly readily

 We have only recently requested a full extract of this information from D&B 
for our counterparties (because this is also required for SAP).
 Because of difficulties in matching our records to D&B - their names are NOT 
always the exact legal name - we have only been able to obtain
 roughly 7365 out of the more than 11,400 records we have (65%).  Of the 7365 
records matched, not all have State of Incorporation either because 
 1) They are not U.S. parties or 2) They are not incorporated entities or 3) 
D&B is missing the information (990).

 We recently obtained a list of state of incorporation for companies from 
Legal which is the source we were going to use to populate this information 
for the  ones we were missing.  We hired temps to do this, but were then 
requested to stop this activity by Frank Davis.

 For Foreign entities, the country of incorporation has been difficult to 
find as it is not readily available from D&B.  Any knowledge or suggestions 
would be appreciated.

We are changing our procedures to request this information when we call the 
counterparty to collect information for setup.

In reviewing the counterparty matrix of 9/8, we can assist with providing 
some of the state of incorporations for parties in Sections 2,3, and 4.  I 
have asked IT to extract this information from GCP for you.  Country of 
Incorporation for non-U.S. does not yet exist in GCP - this is currently 
under development with a target production date of mid-October therefore, 
this cannot be provided.  I think however, that the London Credit system has 
Country of Registration (same as Incorporation) that could possibly help.

As soon as the values we have for State of Incorporation are populated in the 
counterparty matrix, I will forward to you.

Subject: Country/State of Incorporation

The objective of EnronOnline is to trade with as many people as possible in 
as many product types as possible.  

Both the legal and tax reviews that I have seen thus far have included 
non-trade status customers that I understand may or may not be eligible to 
trade if we had the country/state of incorporation.  Apparently our records 
are not very robust relative to this piece of information.  

If possible I would like to get a better understanding of all the issue 
surrounding country of incorporation so that we can determine the best course 
of action for obtaining this information if we determine that it is 
essential.  In addition to ensure that we collect this information each time 
we add a new counterparty.

Short of having this information it is my understanding that US tax has 
completed its review of the counterparty matrix and 

Questions:

Is anyone aware of an easy way of obtaining country/state of incorporation?

If we had country/state of incorporation how many counterparties would be 
affected?  (That is if we had country/state of incorporation it might allow 
us to take a counterparty from non-trade status to trade status.)

Can we identify the counterparty names (on the customer matrix which was 
e-mailed on 08/09/99 copy attached) which might be affected by having 
country/state of incorporation?

Is this the only remaining issue impacting the tax review of the counterparty 
matrix dated 08/09/99.  If so are Jeff and Janine ready to sign off on the 
matrix? Can I get a copy of your completed matrix for upload?

Bob,

PA is Password Application Agreement, which is 1 page legal document that 
must be signed by the customer.
System Admin. in the other company may be a Trader as well, I assume, and in 
addition it depends on this company internal policy how they'll manage ETA 
acceptance process.... 

Thank you for your comments, decision about which alternative to choose for 
unknown customers has not been made yet .... Louise?

Re Marketing Pack, Rahil is working on it. 
David Port and Arfan are developing the forms. First draft of Customer 
Registration form is attached herewith.

Elena,

Some queries/comments.

1. Existing Enron Customers (approx 2,000)

The first person from the customer's company logging Online has to accept 
ETA. After that ETA has to be available for viewing and printing for all 
other users.
The first person logging on will always be the Administrator (to set up his 
users) so how can a probable non-trading user accept ETAs for his traders?
PA = Password Application, right? Hadn't heard of this until now.


3. Unknown Customers (currently not trading with Enron) willing to get 
Trading Access
Alternative 1 most closely mirrors what we're doing for our existing customer 
base and so the procedures will already be in place for EOL Product Control / 
System Admin to run this. If the marketing pack mailing method is utilised we 
cut down on extra effort in a number of areas (marketing pack will be signed 
off by legal, business processes already there, no extra development effort, 
single point of reference).


Any chance of seeing what format the marketing pack / application is in so 
far? We'll need to make sure that the information we're requesting is 
comprehensive enough from a systems' perspective.

Thanks,

Bob

Subject: Registration Process Questions

Last two days showed that there is a big confusion on how exactly the 
registration process is going to work. The issue is very important and urgent 
as it may cause changes to the scope for Agency.com, and changes in the ETA 
and PA documents text.
 
The registration process appears to differ for different customer groups and, 
to my understanding, the latest was agreed as below. Please provide your 
comments or any corrections to the following:

1. Existing Enron Customers (approx 2,000)

will receive marketing Pack via mail approx. 2 weeks before the system goes 
live. The Marketing Pack will include PA (for an appropriate jurisdiction) 
and Registration Forms with questions about the customer (name, address, 
e-mail, taxable entity etc.) 
customers will fill in Registration Form, sign PA and mail it back to Enron
After the customer is approved for Online Trading by Enron, it will receive 
IDs and Passwords that customer's Administrator will grant to individual 
traders in that company
The first person from the customer's company logging Online has to accept 
ETA. After that ETA has to be available for viewing and printing for all 
other users.

Q:  Will PA be available as well as ETA for viewing and printing in the 
"House"?


2. Guest Users ( also referred to as Read Only Users) - Regulators, Lawyers, 
Brokers, Potential Traders etc.

will phone or sent e-mail (possibly fill in a form online, that will be 
automatically e-mailed) to Enron System Administrator. Customers will provide 
info on their name, e-mail address, mailing address, country of incorporation 
etc.
If Enron approves the customer as a Guest user, the System Administrator will 
e-mail customer Guest ID and Password.
When the customer logs in for the  first time as a guest, it'll  have to 
accept Read Only ETA on line. Read Only ETA will depend on the guest's place 
of incorporation, i.e. the system has to recognise the customer when it logs 
in and display an appropriate Read Only ETA. Without accepting Read Only ETA 
"Guest" user won't be able to view anything in the House.

Q:  1) Should Read Only ETA be printable and where?
 2) What limitations will be imposed on the Guest User, i.e. one log in 
session, limited time etc. - This decision has to be made in order for CC to 
put an appropriate language into the Read Only ETA. Read Only ETAs for all 
jurisdictions have to be finalised by July 7th.
 3) In the Garden there must be a sentence (to be drafted by CC) to inform 
potential Guest User that his request for Read Only access may not be granted.
 4) Is Read Only ETA accepted online or it should be signed and mailed back 
to Enron as a hard copy? The latest agreed was that it will be signed off 
line, but accepting it online should work as well, and seems to be a cleaner 
way...

3. Unknown Customers (currently not trading with Enron) willing to get 
Trading Access

There are two alternatives possible.
Alternative One: Off Line Registration

Potential Customer will e-mail, phone to express their willingness to trade 
online, i.e. get the ID and Password
Enron will mail Registration Pack to the Potential Customer with PA for 
appropriate jurisdiction
Customer will fill in Registration Form, sign PA and mail it back to Enron
If the customer is approved for Online Trading by Enron, it will receive IDs 
and Passwords that customer's Administrator will grant to individual traders 
in that company
The first person from the customer's company logging Online has to accept 
ETA. After that ETA has to be available for viewing and printing for all 
other users.

Alternative Two:  Partial OnLine Registration

Registration Pack including PAs for all jurisdictions will be available in 
the Garden
Customer has to chose (drop down box) which jurisdiction he is in,  print out 
appropriate Registration Pack and PA,  fill in Registration Form, sign PA and 
mail it to Enron
If the customer is approved for Online Trading by Enron, it will receive IDs 
and Passwords that customer's Administrator will grant to individual traders 
in that company
The first person from the customer's company logging Online has to accept 
ETA. After that ETA has to be available for viewing and printing for all 
other users.

Q:  1) Alternative 1 or 2?
 2) In the Garden there must be a sentence (to be drafted by CC) to inform 
potential customers that there request for Read Only access may not be 
granted.
 3) Should all ETAs and PAs be available and printable in the Garden? CC 
prefers them to be available...

Regards,
Elena

Below are my responses to your email:

1.  Masters that limit weather trading or contain another trading limitation 
in the master only:   per our conversation.
2.  CMS Marketing Services & Trading:  Trading is limited to fixed price 
swaps, basis swaps, swing swaps and options.  This limitation is contained in 
the Company's Trading Policy, which they have provided to us.   We cannot 
trade anything except the types of products listed in the trading policy.
3.  Venezuela:  per Mark's conv. w/Dave Forster, we do not want to pursue the 
due diligence on this country at this time.
4.  Phibro, Inc.:    see note #1
5.  Swiss Re:  See my note 11 below.
6.  Tokyo Mitsubishi:  We are preparing amendments that would be added to to 
the Online and regular confirmations when they go out to deal with the lack 
of legal terms in the master to do anything but interest rate and currency 
transactions.  This should solve our problem so we should be able to open 
them for trading any commodity.
7.  Trinidad & Tobago:  same comment as #3 above.
8.  UBS AG.  They recently sold their book and got out of the energy 
commodity business so we should not be doing anything but FX and interest 
rate transactions with them.  Their master is also trading limited, and we 
could not trade energy commodities with them without amending it or doing a 
fix similar to Tokyo Mitsubishi.
9.  Aspect Resources.  I discussed this one with Mark and Bill, and we have 
agreed to open up Aspect for all trading under the Master.
10.  Brant-Allen:  Their Board of Directors limited the trading we did with 
them to only the one trade we did under the master.  We cannot do any other 
trading with them without specific pre-approval via a new resolution from 
their Board of Directors.  So they are still "no" for online derivatives 
trading.
11.  Insurance Companies:  With respect to trading with insurance/reinsurance 
companies without a master in place, these types of counterparties have 
special authority/legal issues that the online trading process does not 
address.  When we do trades with this type of counterparty without a master 
in place we get legal opinions, guarantees, articles of incorporation & 
bylaws and other kinds of statutory documentation to evidence the approval 
for this type of counterparties doing these types of transactions.  All kinds 
of special representations are also added to the contract based on the type 
of counterparty.  We therefore have to continue to say "no" to online trading 
based on these special handling procedures.
12.  Cox and Perkins:  We could say "yes" to online derivatives trading, 
however, would have to treat them like any other counterparty we did not have 
a master in place with.
13.  Kinetic Resources.  Ditto comment 12 above.
14.  Midland Cogeneration.  Still under review as to regulated utility status.
15.  Praixair:  see comment #1 above.
16.  Tembec.  The bylaws of this corporation require that all contracts for 
this counterparty must be executed by two officers from a list they provided 
to us .  I spoke to Mark about this and they could not trade online unless 
their Password Application was signed by two of the officers as directed 
above.  Another way to solve this would be to get a special resolution from 
Tembec's board of directors allowing only one individual to sign the Password 
Application.  Either way, you cannot trade online without meeting these 
special signatory requirements.
17.  EW Scripps.  Same comment as #1 above.
18.  Maritime Electric.  Is a Canadian utility.  No Trading.

Critical Changes to my list:

1.  Mexico:  Per our conversation, we are contacting outside counsel to 
request legal advice as to whether online transactions are enforceable in 
Mexico.  However, we can still not do financial trading without having a 
master in place.
2.  Public Service Company of Colorado:  the person that signed the master 
appears not to have the authority to sign the master, so until we get this 
resolved, we are switching them to a "no".

Per my meeting today with Credit:

I've got 38 we disagree on, either as to whether they're a regulated utility 
or an eligible swap participant.  I'll be working on those tomorrow and will 
get back to you.

My Review of Your List:

List #1

1.  BP Exploration & Oil Inc.:  Originated from London Credit, missing from 
your list.  This is a counterparty that both Houston & London trade with.  
ECT has a master in place with them.  Trades would roll under the ECT 
Master.  The master is the old ECT Form of master that limits the trading to 
energy price swaps and options.  No weather.  Case of Credit override.5
2.  Elf Trading:  Both ECT and ECT International have masters in place and 
trade with this counterparty.  Mark was going to talk to Louise about what to 
do with these situations when we have more than one master in place.
3.  Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York:  We've got several overlapping 
issues I am going to have to talk to London about.  First, here in the U.S. 
Morgan got out of the energy commodity business.  We, in fact, "bought their 
book".  We actually couldn't "buy their book" because of our low credit 
rating relative to Morgan, so all their trades remain in place, 'tho all 
payments go in and out through us and we act as servicer for their commodity 
business.  Their master with ECT is bad, it only covers energy price swap 
(not options!) and does not have the trade option rep which means if we were 
to do an option transaction with them we would have to do a fix similar to 
the Tokyo Mitsubishi fix.  Saying all that, I don't know what, if any, 
trading Morgan continues to do outside the U.S.  I need to talk to London and 
find out.  So Morgan right now is a big open issue.
4.  Vitol S.A.:   Both Houston and London trade with this counterparty.  
Houston has a master with this counterparty.  Trades should be done under the 
master.  The master does not cover weather, so this would be another case of 
the Credit override.
5.  Missing counterparties from 1st list:   (1) Wisconsin Electric Power 
Company, no master in place, not approved for trading, it is a utility, (2) 
Wisconsin Gas Company, no master in place, not approved for trading, it is a 
utility, (3) Wisconsin Power and Light Company, we do have a master in place, 
approved for all trading, except weather, which is not covered in the master, 
would have to be a Credit override, (4) Xeron, Inc., no master in place, 
approved for all trading.

List #2

1.  Cabot Oil & Gas:  Missed "X" on final set of weather
2.  Callon Petroleum:  Missed "X" on final set of weather
3.  EIL Petroleum:  Missed "X" on final set of weather
4.  Fortune Energy:  Missed "X" on final set of weather
5.  Plains Resources:  Missed "X" on all weather
6.  PXRE Corp:  deleted final set of weather, good for weather deals only
7.  St. Mary Land & Exploration:  Missed "X" on final set of weather
8.  Stratum Group:  Missed "X" on final set of weather
9.  Tempest Reinsurance:  deleted final set of weather, good for weather 
deals only
10.  Twister Gas:  Missed "X" on final set of weather
11.  United Salt:  Missed "X" on final set of weather
12.  West Texas Gas:  Missed "X" on final set of weather

List #3

1.  Bargo Energy:  Missed "X" on final set of weather
2.  Belco Oil & Gas:  Missed "X" on final set of weather
3.  Cross Timbers:  Missed "X" on all weather
4.  Encore Acquisition:  Missed "X" on final set of weather
5.  Norfolk Southern:  You've got them restricted for everything, I've got 
them as "OK" for everything
6.  RMS Monte Christo:  Missed "X" on final set of weather
7.  Sapient Energy:  Missed "X" on final set of weather

David,

Here's a first cut of the data to get us started.  Please have a look, and 
let me know what other blanks we will need to fill in as we go.  I've also 
looked at the additional considerations, and we should sit down and discuss 
some of these things with Jean sometime soon.

Please review the attached documents, and I'll continue to refine them along

following items for NA:

- NA GTC's

- NA PA
- Brochure contents (including letters)
- Website Contents (including help and FAQ's)
- General legal relationship and structure of the website and the contracts.
- Long and Short descriptions 

Thanks,

by the party we originally mailed it to, we can accept it and process it.  If 
a PA comes back from another party, we schould call the party we originally 
mailed to and ask what the signatory parties role is (ie who is he/she and 
what authority do they have).  Mark feels we should attempt to verify the 
signatory parties responsibilities however one attempt will be sufficient.  
Please keep good notes in the database (date, time of call, who you talked 
to, etc.)  If you have any questions on this call me.

If we receive a PA signed by someone at a company, then that individual is 
representing that they have the authority to do so (principle of ostensible 
authority)

We should obviously be careful that the mailing address matches what is in 
our database, but beyond that, no further checks should be required. Please 
proceed with sending the ID's.

Thanks,

Subject: Customer PA's

To date we have received a few PA's that have been signed by a person other 
than the party we mailed to.  We have called the companies and verified 
employment of the signatory parties.  (Called switchboard and requested party 
on the pretense that we had received their PA and would be processing right 
away).  Pending your approval we will start issuing Login id's.  We 
anticipate having the folders and envelopes on Mon or Tues.  We will wait 
until we hear from you to start processing the PA's we have to date.

To date, I have been able to meet one on one with the Houston based 
functional group who will be supporting this critical project.  In those 
discussions, I have found that the members are coming from different levels 
of knowledge of this project.  It is my intention to bring everybody up to 
speed at the same knowledge base.  I would like to meet with you on Tuesday, 
June 1, from 10 - 11:30 a.m.  Conference room EB-32c2 has been reserved for 
this meeting.  Please let me know if you will or will not be able to attend 
this meeting.

After our one on one discussions, I forwarded to each of you all of the data 
that I have received to date from London.  I recommend that you review this 
documentation prior to our meeting on Tuesday, June 1.  I have also included 
David Port's latest "Operational Policy and Procedures" file which supersedes 
what I previously sent to you regarding this section only.




Also attached is the on-line trading project team member list from the London 
and Houston based operations within each respective function.  This list 
includes the groups that they will be representing, telephone numbers, and 
locations.  Please review this list for corrections and updates, and give me 
these changes.  I will update the list and forward the revised copy to you.  
If I have missed anyone, it has not been intentional, and I apologize.




Paul Racicot, Andy Thomas and I met on Wednesday, May 26, with Jay Webb and 
his IT team to start detailed discussion around company profile, customer 
profile, and trader profile.  A number of "to do" items came out of this 
meeting; I have started working on these items as follows:

Customer Profile  We are in the process of pulling our "mission" critical 
counterparties by product.  This will be based on each products' top 
counterparties within the 1998 business year.  Each product list has a 
different scope to narrow the number, thus helping focus on those critical 
counterparties.  The lists will be given to Paul Racicot who will distribute 
to the appropriate commercial heads in Houston to identify which 
counterparties listed and/or additions/deletions for first phase 
implementation.  After these short lists have been agreed upon, the 
counterparty information will go to our credit and legal groups for due 
diligence to assure that everything is appropriate for phase one 
implementation.

Customer Profile - General Terms and Conditions   Another outcome from this 
meeting dealt with the general terms and conditions [GTC] and how they will 
relate to each of the specific counterparties.

Customer Profile - Field Descriptions 
I am also co-ordinating with the legal group for their review and comment on 
the wording of the "short" and "long" description within the company profile 
screen.

David Port will be in Houston next week.  David and I will meet to develop 
the following:

specific work schedules by discipline which will include key activities, 
individuals, and critical timing required to meet phase one for the project 
deadline
confirm that the system can do what we imply it should do in this process
confirm that it is workable for US traded products
fill in any gaps between locations, product business, etc.
agree the method of roll - out to business units because it needs their 
cooperation
decide and address resource implications

I thank all of you for your participation in this project and sharing your 
knowledge and time to bring this project to a successful completion.  I look 
forward to our meeting on Tuesday.

Regards,

David

Dave:

I am willing to examine counterparties on a case-by-case basis as opposed to 
imposing a categorical restriction (although this basically means we'll spend 
quite a bit of time confirming what we already know to be the case -- there 
are probably no European counterparties currently authorized to trade U.S. 
power.)  I'll leave it to Edmund to respond with regard to European 
products.  I would revise the process described below to place the 
responsibility on each legal group to review counterparties based upon 
products (US vs. European).  Accordingly, I will review a list of current 
European counterparties and all new European counterparties to determine if 
they have the necessary authority to U.S. power and leave it to the UK legal 
group to review the list of US counterparties to determine if such 
counterparties should be permitted to trade European power products.  Thus, 
the process would be as follows:

1) Each legal group (NA and UK) defines the rules which are applied to 
restrict companies for trading (e.g. Must have a Power license to trade 
Power) for its group of products
2) Each legal group applies its own rules to all counterparties (NA and UK)

If you will send me a list of all preapproved European counterparties and 
ensure that I receive copies of all new European counterparty lists, I will 
begin implementing this process.

This proposed process is subject to feedback from Edmund and Justin.  

Regards,

Leslie

Subject: Re: F/U re European power trading by U.S. counterparties  

This is contrary to the mandate of EnronOnline, which is to make global 
products trading available to our customers.

If there is a specific reason for shutting down a company, then we must do so 
- but we cannot restrict companies from trading products simply because we 
don't think they want to.

How about this as an alternative:

1) Define the rules which are applied to restrict companies for trading (e.g. 
Must have a Power license to trade Power)
2) Distribute the appropriate rules and company lists between the NA primary 
legal contact and UK primary legal contact (for profile purposes)
3) Each legal group (NA and UK) apply each others rules to the companies 
which they are reviewing
4) Each legal group copies the other with the final company profile which 
they are sending to Frank Davis.


In this way, profiles should be correct as they leave each legal group, but 
each group has the opportunity to scan the work of the other. If there are 
any problems, then the customer profiles can be corrected - if necessary 
after the fact.

This exposes us to (in my opinion) a very small risk that:
 1) The rules for one group are not correctly applied by the other or there 
are extenuating circumstances for a particular party and
 2) The error is not caught before the customer transacts (bear in mind that 
after legal completes their review, there is still a great deal of time 
before the customer can transact, on account of: profile completion process, 
mailing time, customer delay before trading)

Subject: F/U re European power trading by U.S. counterparties

I have spoken with Edmund Cooper to follow up regarding access to European 
power products by U.S. counterparties.  Edmund and Justin Boyd have discussed 
the issue and determined that they would like to follow an approach similar 
to our approach for U.S. power products.  U.S. counterparties should be 
granted read-only access to European power products.  If a specific U.S. 
counterparty wants to trade European power products, the request for access 
can be examined on a case-by-case basis.

Dear Dave,

Justin and I have had another look at the website and noticed that the old 
Legal & Privacy statement is the one being shown.  The additional language in 
the mark-up below needs to be added before European counterparties access the 
site to trade.

In respect of Finland, we have been in contact with our Finnish legal 
advisers and hope to have the issue resolved (hopefully favourably) today.

Thanks, Edmund.

I've now been given access to the Online system, and I've also seen the

Did we ever resolve this issue with tax?  Last time I spoke with Stephen

Please advise as it will have a major impact on how we manage credit risks.

Subject: ENA/ECC

I've discussed the ENA/ECC with both Mark Taylor and Jeff Blumenthal (tax).  
The way it should work is like this:  

ETA now has verbiage which says it is Ok for Canadian or US  financial 
transactions to be done by either ENA or ECC

If a counterparty has a master with ENA we will populate this info in both 
Can and US Financial Product Types.
If a counterparty has a master with ECC we will populate this info in both 
Can and US Financial Product Types

Although we do not have this problem, If a counterparty has a master with 
both ENA and ECC we will populate Can Financial Product types with the ECA 
master and the US Financial Product Types with the ENA master.

I have indicated to Jeff that this should free up the trading on any party 
that has an ENA master and trades Can Fin Product Types

Mark Taylor agrees.  Jeff owes me a phone call on this

Jay and Bob,

following our phone conversation I am sending you the latest version of the 
Product Descriptions. I attached Houston product descriptions as well. Could 
you please review them both and let me know ASAP which format is preferable 
and any other comments you may have.

Also, we've been working with lawyers on Enabling agreement that will be 
signed with counterparties off-line. The current structure is:

One page Internet Trading Access Agreement (ITAA) will be signed off line as 
prerequisite for getting a password.
Five page long Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA) will be accepted ("clicked 
through") on the Website by each person authorised by the counterparty.

I attached here both documents for two jurisdictions - UK and USA. There are 
two important issues that require your input: 

1) in the US document lawyers refer to "services". UK lawyers were not sure 
what it means and replaced it with "access and utilisation of the Website" 
assuming that what it is. They asked to confirm whether it is correct or 
anything else we have to include. 
Mark, could you please advise on this?

2) On the Data protection issue UK lawyers wrote the following: 

"On reflection, it will be more appropriate for relevant data protection 
wording to be on the Website itself rather than in the ITAA or ETA.
> This is because the data protection concerns revolve around data subjects 
i.e. living

Again, your prompt reply is appreciated.






Thank you,
Elena

Over the past several weeks, we have seen an increase in the number of 
"killed" or modified EOL transactions.   Please remind each of your 
respective groups that this is not an option. Once a customer "clicks" on a 
deal, we have a valid, binding contract.   We lose our audit trail, and we 
can potentially expose ourselves from a Legal standpoint.   I talked to Mark 
Taylor about this today, and the best option is for Legal to prepare a 
termination agreement when we agree to let a customer out of a deal.  We 
(Product Control) should be notified immediately if someone is requesting to 
change an EOL deal.  You can call either myself, Jennifer Denny (x35824), 
Frank Davis (x37235), or Dale Neuner (39746). 

Call me if you have any questions.

Two new Product Types have been created and require approval. In the 
DataManager you will find:

US Jet Kero Fin Swap - which you will find in Partialy Approved

and

US West Power Phy Spd - which you will find in Awaiting Approval.

The automated e-mail function associated with the notification of parties 
when a Product Type is created or approved is not functioning, and we are 
working to have the problem fixed. In the interim, please approve the Product 
Types and send me an e-mail when you are done.

As you would expect the respective commercial areas are eager to have these 
Product Types availabble for trading.

Attached are revised drafts of the New York PA and ETA, which have been 
revised to reflect the latest Clifford Chance drafts and our discussion 
yesterday.  We are unable to blackline these drafts, due to the fact that the 
Clifford Chance drafts are not on our system (and we did not receive all of 
them in any event).  Also, we have not yet received from Mark's office the 
language on confirmations; we have taken a shot at it but can obviously 
modify it after we get the language.

Finally, we have attached a blackline of the "Legal and Privacy" statement, 
reflecting some suggested changes.  We also note that, if this document is to 
be "global", we will either need to decide on a single governing law or 
delete choice of law entirely.

Best regards.

Subject: Auction Procedures

Unless you object, we have decided to structure the auction site with the 
"auction procedures" set out on the bid page, immediately above the "submit" 
button.  As soon as the bid is submitted, the system will check to see if the 
counterparty has already accepted the GTC's or has a master in place.  Here 
is S&C's first draft of the procedures for an auction without a reserve 
price, with no commitment to sell (or buy) and no disclosure of bids to other 
parties.  It is my impression that this is the way the EnBank auctions will 
be conducted.  Is that correct?  Any suggestions/comments?

Mark

Attached is a draft of the Auction Procedures we discussed.  Because I don't 
know how the auction page will be configured, it is likely that conforming 
changes will be necessary.  Also, I have left the references to "Enron" in 
brackets; I am not sure if a specific entity will be referenced or if all 
entities will be defined collectively as "Enron".  Please call or e-mail with 
any questions or comments.  Best regards.

Q1: Did you write your web page internally or use an outside company?

A: Enron used an outside company for the web page coding, but the internal 
applications which our traders use for posting their bids and offers were 
built by Enron personnel.


Q2: What is the name of the outside agency which Enron used for web page 
development and how can we contact them?

A: The company which wrote the internet software for EnronOnline is 
Agency.com. 


Q3: Are you satisfied with Agency's performance?

Further to the Legal Requirements in my last email:

The following should be accomplished by Wednesday, to meet the upload 
deadline. I realise this is a tight deadline and appreciate your cooperation 
in addressing these concerns, which have only just recently come to light.

1) In the attached spreadsheet, identify the GTC which covers each Product 
Type for the GTC's which you have written.



note I have completed the first U.S. Natgas as an example.

Please email your update on this spreadsheet to Andrew Thomas.

2) The MasterProductData Spreadsheet (MPS) is attached. It contains a tab 
called Shortdesc. This tab shows a list of Product Types and an index of  
Product Additional Information (PAI) fields which apply to each Product Type. 
There are further tabs on the spreadsheet which correspond to the PAI's. The 
descriptions which appear to the customers on the website will be comprised 
of the Product description on the LongDesc tab and the descriptions from the 
applicable parts of the applicable PAI tabs.  I have confirmed that this 
spreadsheet contains all comments received to date, excluding financials, 
which we are working on seperately. 



Following is a suggested process:

-  List all of the variables in the GTC which would need to be quantified or 
defined in the MPS. Think of the MPS as being the equivalent of the trader's 
conversation with the customer (which is reflected in a final confirmation), 
which covers the commercial, specific terms of the deal.

- Compare this list with the MPS. Confirm that the language of the MPS 
conforms with the requirements of the GTC. Rember to check both the Product 
description found on the LongDesc tab as well as the tabs for each of the 
PAI's for that Product. The PAI's for each Product are listed on the 
ShortDesc page.

- Don't worry about any missing entries for index types, locations, etc. 
These should be filled for accuracy and completeness by the confirmations 
groups. Any changes you make to Products language will be incorporated into 
any new additions.

- Make any changes on the spreadsheet using a red font to highlight and email 
it back to Andrew Thomas.

3) Once the above is complete, and all additions from the confirmations 
groups have been incorporated, we will email back a complete set for final 
approval.

Thanks,

Dave
