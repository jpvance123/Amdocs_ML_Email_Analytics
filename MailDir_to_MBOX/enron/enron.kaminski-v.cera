TITLE: CERA Monthly Oil Briefing: Fundamentals Update 
E-mail Category: CERA Monthly Briefing 
CERA Knowledge Area: World Oil 

In the past two weeks, oil prices have sold off the premium or price strength 
that had been built into the market in anticipation of possible shortages 
this winter. The exact cause of the sharp switch in market psychology is hard 
to pinpoint but seems to be a combination of very early signs that the oil 
stock situation is at least stabilizing, even if stocks have not built 
substantially, and that, thus far, despite a few weeks of colder-than-normal 
temperatures, heating oil supply has been adequate to meet demand in the key 
US market. That has allayed some of the concerns that were driving 
speculative interest into the market. Furthermore, the potential for weakness 
in the US economy may be creating expectations for weaker oil demand in 2001. 

The change in market psychology was dramatically illustrated when news that 
Iraq was cutting off exports caused prices to slide, yet, the Iraqi export 
cutoff is having a concrete effect on fundamentals. If the cutoff lasts 
through December, the effect will be pronounced-it would turn a projected 
fourth quarter 2000 stockbuild of 0.5 million barrels per day (mbd) into a 
stockdraw of 0.1 mbd. We expect Iraqi production levels to remain erratic 
because of its dispute with the UN Security Council over sanctions, and 
exports may again cease. At some point such a development would have a price 
supportive effect. 

CERA's price outlook for 2001 remains the same as that in the World Oil Watch 
released in late November. Assuming normal winter weather and no prolonged or 
repeated shutdowns of Iraqi production, the projected average for first 
quarter 2001 is $29 per barrel for WTI. However, this outlook is based on 
OPEC's announcing an agreement early in the first quarter to cut its 
production by the start of the second quarter. A failure to restrain output 
would result in a downward adjustment to an average of $27 WTI for the first 
quarter of 2001, with prices lower in the second half of the quarter than in 
the first. The downward pressure results from the prospect of a 
larger-than-usual implied build in stocks during the second quarter of about 
3.0 mbd-with a cut in OPEC output.

Iraq in a Twilight Zone 
As anticipated, Iraq ceased exporting oil under the UN-controlled "oil for 
food" program as of December 1 in protest over the rejection by the Security 
Council's sanctions committee of its proposed December export price schedule.*

Iraq's pricing was judged by the UN overseers, who monitor the export program 
and advise the sanctions committee, to be about 60 cents per barrel below 
comparable crudes in an apparent attempt to offset an illicit surcharge that 
Iraq was seeking from buyers.

Although the standoff with the sanctions committee continues, Iraq partially 
resumed exporting on December 13. Since then, about 1 mbd has been exported 
from the Mina al-Bakr terminal in the Persian Gulf. Prior to the shutdown, 
Iraqi exports under UN auspices were at a rate of 2.21 mbd for November, as 
compared with 2.08 mbd for the third quarter. Exports for November were about 
1.3 mbd from Mina al-Bakr and about 0.9 mbd from Ceyhan in the Mediterranean. 
Exports from Ceyhan have not resumed, owing to the surcharge dispute, with 
the result that about 1.2 mbd of Iraqi crude remains off the market.

Iraq's semi-shutdown has put it into a kind of twilight zone while its 
dispute with the sanctions committee over pricing continues. (In the midst of 
this dispute, the UN Security Council approved phase nine of the oil-for-food 
program at the last minute on December 5; it became effective on December 6 
and has been accepted by Iraq). As of December19, Iraq's revised export price 
for Ceyhan, proposed for the remainder of December, has again been judged too 
low by the overseers and is expected to be rejected by the sanctions 
committee. Additionally, the overseers have notified lifters of Iraqi crude 
that any oil payment made directly to Iraq rather than to the UN escrow 
account would be a violation of UN sanctions. Buyers of Iraqi oil from Mina 
al-Bakr have consistently been reported as saying that they are not paying a 
surcharge to Iraq.

How long Iraq may operate at about half capacity is unclear, but it continues 
to request a surcharge payment from prospective lifters at Ceyhan in an 
apparent effort to circumvent and degrade the UN financial controls that are 
the heart of the sanctions system. The distinction that Iraq has made between 
Mina al-Bakr and Ceyhan arose when it resumed operations at Mina al-Bakr by 
loading two cargoes for the India Oil Company. Iraq may have judged this 
accommodation to be in its interest, since it recently also signed an oil 
exploration contract with India under which payments would be made in oil. As 
currently structured, the deal would violate UN sanctions, but India is 
seeking an exception from the Security Council on grounds of economic 
hardship. The exception seems unlikely to be granted, which may lead Iraq to 
cease exports from Mina al-Bakr again.

There are many possible scenarios that Iraq could follow, but we expect 
uncertainty about Iraqi exports to continue as Iraq uses its oil exports as 
leverage to undermine sanctions in its ongoing struggle with the Security 
Council to end all restraints. Consequently, the Iraq factor will remain an 
element in the oil price outlook. 

Iraq's antisanctions campaign has also raised the visibility of the Iraq 
issue in Washington as the incoming Bush administration prepares to take 
office. Secretary of State-designate Colin Powell has already acknowledged a 
need to reassess Iraq policy and has said that he would work to "reenergize" 
sanctions. The Iraq issue is being debated in virtually every foreign 
policy-oriented think tank in Washington. A consensus seems to be emerging 
around seeking renewed international support and legitimacy for sanctions by 
retaining UN control over Iraq's oil revenue and strictly enforcing a 
prohibition on sales of weapons and related material while lifting general 
trade controls that increasingly are both ineffective and an international 
irritant. There is virtually no sentiment in favor of operations to 
destabilize or remove the Saddam Hussein regime on the pragmatic basis that 
the prospects for success are remote.

Demand Trends 
Record high US natural gas prices have increased the economic incentive for 
gas consumers with the capability to switch from gas to distillate to do so, 
and reports of switching are emerging in a number of areas. Interruptible gas 
customers with resid or distillate fuel back-up have already switched to oil, 
so it is now firm gas supply customers with the potential to add to the 
already high level of distillate demand. So far in December US distillate 
demand is running at a record high December level of 3.9 mbd. However, only a 
small portion of this demand is the result of economically based 
fuel-switching from gas to distillate. CERA estimates that the additional 
demand likely to come from further switching of gas to distillate is 
relatively small, on the order of 0.1 to 0.2 mbd. In CERA's view it is likely 
that only a portion of the theoretical capacity will be switched on short 
notice because in some cases, this theoretically switchable capacity has not 
been used in recent years, and tankage and delivery infrastructure may be in 
uncertain condition. 

Switching by interruptible gas customers (such as utilities) to distillate 
began about a month or more ago, although the volumes involved are relatively 
small. Switching to residual fuel already occurred months ago when gas prices 
started to surge in the summer. A portion of the US secondary and tertiary 
distillate stockbuild seen this autumn was likely prompted by interruptible 
gas customers filling their reserve distillate fuel storage. Given the 
expectations of a tight gas market, regulators have been explicit about 
enforcing back-up fuel storage requirements in the months leading up to the 
current heating season. 

Other end users of natural gas have few or no options for fuel switching. 
Some ammonia and ethane producers have shut down operations because the cost 
of feedstock natural gas is high. Natural gas is also used in some enhanced 
oil recovery operations, and some of these producers have also opted to sell 
gas back to the grid rather than produce oil. 

Supply Trends 
Non-OPEC supply for the fourth quarter is expected to be up 0.9 mbd over a 
year earlier at 46.4 mbd. Recent events include a shortfall in Mexican 
production, curtailed in October by about 300,000 bd owing to the effects of 
Hurricane Keith. Mexico's fourth quarter liquids production is expected to be 
3.64 mbd-about 95 percent of Mexican liquids capacity. Norway's output 
increased 200,000 bd from October to November as maintenance season ended. 
Norway's production for the fourth quarter is expected to be 3.53 mbd.*

Growing Russian crude oil production throughout the year is supporting a 
recent surge in exports, in spite of higher export taxes. Russian exports of 
domestic oil production (excluding transit volumes) reached 2.5 mbd in 
November, after remaining fairly steady at about 2.35 mbd from July though 
October. Fourth quarter oil exports are expected to average 2.5 mbd, 0.3 mbd 
greater than in the fourth quarter 1999.

CERA estimates Iraqi oil production averaged 2.91 mbd in November-down 0.1 
mbd from the October level. The cutoff in exports earlier this month reduced 
Iraqi output for the first 12 days of December to roughly 0.8 mbd. Iraq 
resumed exports of about 1 mbd on December 13, which raised production to 
1.80 mbd. Assuming no change in Iraq's current production stance, Iraqi 
production would average 1.41 mbd for December. On a quarterly basis, the 
decline in Iraq output would lead to estimated OPEC output in the fourth 
quarter of 29.0 mbd and would turn an estimated global oil stockbuild of 0.5 
mbd into a stockdraw of 0.1 mbd. These production estimates include 0.15 mbd 
of crude oil exports to Syria that began on November 20 without UN 
authorization and are continuing.

Oil Stocks 
US crude oil inventories (DOE data) have climbed intermittently from an 
annual low of 280 million barrels in September and reached 292 million 
barrels in mid-December (see Figure 1). Since prices weakened in late 
November, crude oil stocks have stabilized above the annual low in September 
and the ranges seen in October to levels from 289-292 million barrels.

Primary inventories of US heating oil remain well below year-earlier levels; 
at 48 million barrels they are 15 million barrels, or 24 percent less, than 
those of a year ago, but there are indications of builds in secondary and 
tertiary inventories. We estimate that wholesale and consumer stocks are up 
5-10 million barrels since August and are actually higher than they were at 
the end of last year.

In Europe crude oil stocks are at more comfortable levels when compared with 
those of the United States. In November stocks rose nearly 9 million barrels 
to 426 million barrels. At this level they are below the highs of 1999 but 
well above the low levels of early 1996 (see Figure 2). Japanese crude oil 
inventories at end-October were 107.6 million barrels, which is above the 
record low set earlier this year but still well below levels seen in recent 
years (see Figure 3).

TITLE: Access on the Block: International Transmission Auctions Are Opening 
European Power Markets 
E-mail Category: CERA Insight 
CERA Knowledge Area: European Power 

Despite an apparent impasse in negotiations among European transmission 
system operators, regulators, and the European Commission in Florence, 
auctions of international transmission capacity (ITC) in France, the United 
Kingdom, Denmark, Belgium, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Slovenia, and the 
Netherlands are opening access between countries and paving the way for the 
single European marketplace.

However, the patchwork auctioning of access to ITC leaves important issues 
unresolved. The most significant of these include the potential for gaming, 
third-party transit, and the allocation of auction proceeds. As they stand, 
these issues, CERA believes, are likely to lead to action at the European 
level and the eventual imposition of a more integrated scheme.

Nevertheless, current plans to open most of Europe's ITC represent a 
watershed of activity that will hasten transparency in the market and 
determine trade flows and signal transmission investment in 2001.

International Auctions Are Opening Markets 
A major portion of international transmission capacity on the Continent will 
be allocated by auction in 2001 (see Table 1). In CERA's view auctions for 
ITC are likely to have the greatest impact during 2001 in the following areas:

* Increasing market transparency. The posting of available transmission 
capacity on yearly, monthly, and daily bases will facilitate the market's 
efficient usage of scarce interconnector capacity. For the first time, 
signals for new transmission investment, power flows, and transmission asset 
valuation will come from the market.

* Increasing cross-border trade. Although auctions may not reduce uncertainty 
in the marketplace initially, the effect of heightened transparency in access 
rules and prices will soon work to increase trade. Secondary markets for 
interconnector capacity will add to the number of actively traded power 
products and work to increase the overall level of trade.? 

* Increasing price correlation. Auctions will replace nonmarket-based 
allocation methods such as long-term capacity reservation. The dynamic 
character of shorter-term auctions, combined with an expected secondary 
market for capacity, should bring access to international capacity in line 
with the needs of the market. In this way the market will be able to adjust 
more rapidly to changes in local conditions and thereby work to correlate 
pricing points.

* Increasing competition. Once players have secured access to ITC at a given 
price, they will be looking to sign supply contracts or integrate the 
capacity into structured deals. The result could be more aggressive 
maneuvering on the part of incumbents and new entrants alike, resulting in 
greater competition at the national level.

* Reducing the competitiveness of imports. The results of international 
transmission capacity auctions will determine the competitiveness of imported 
power into domestic markets. Final prices offered for ITC will reflect the 
relative cost of power between markets and work to make cheaper power more 
expensive to import.

* Spurring investment in transmission. The money raised through auction could 
provide transmission companies with the financial capability to invest in 
upgrading international transmission links. Access to international 
transmission capacity between the Netherlands, Germany, and Belgium in 2001 
was auctioned for 63 million euros (see http://www.tso-auction.org for 
details).? Auctions for access into Spain, France, and Italy are expected to 
realize a premium for access to highly coveted markets. 

Connecting Rather than Integrating Markets 
Auctions between national grids, or more accurately commercial grids, are a 
pragmatic approach to the problem of granting access to scarce international 
transmission capacity on an open and transparent basis. The auctions will 
open access to interconnectors and at the same time reward transmission 
system operators.

Even so, the proposed approaches are not likely to satisfy market players or 
the stated objectives of European policymakers. In CERA's view the following 
issues may eventually bring down the hammer on ITC auctions:

* Third-party transit. The bilateral nature of ITC auctions perpetrates the 
problem of tariff pancaking and discriminates against trade involving transit 
through a third grid. This is ultimately inconsistent with the European 
Commission's objective of a single European power market. The fact that 
physical power flows do not follow contractual flows and almost always 
transit third-party grids further weakens the legitimacy of the approach.

* Transaction-based scheme. Although still transactional in nature (tied to a 
specific deal), auctions fall within the European Commission's stated 
preference for market-based mechanisms for allocating international 
transmission capacity. It remains to be seen how successful this approach is 
in achieving integration of national markets. Action at the European level 
could move allocation of ITC in the direction of nontransactional mechanisms 
such as market splitting, counter trading, or redispatching. 

* Gaming of auctions. Auctions will in theory allocate access to transmission 
on a nondiscriminatory market basis to those that value it most. In practice 
it remains to be seen if gaming can be avoided. Even though most of the 
auctions have placed limits on ownership of transmission capacity, tactical 
maneuvers could bid up transmission prices as players act to raise the price 
of imported power.

* Allocating auction proceeds. One likely outcome of auctions will be the 
transfer of profits between players as transmission owners recoup some of the 
rents currently reaped by other players. This will works to raise the value 
of transmission assets relative to generation, suppliers, or traders. It 
remains to be seen how funds from auctions will be allocated among 
transmission companies and the grid, as transmission is still currently 
subject to monopoly regulation.

Re: Introduction of the European Gas Advisory Service and European Power
Advisory Service

For the past 15 years, CERA's European Gas and Power Retainer Advisory
Service has  been primarily a natural gas service, with a small component
related to electric power issues.  In recognition of the changing industry
and regulatory environment for electric power, we have significantly added
to our electric power capabilities in Europe over the past three years, in
terms of both staff and of the depth and breadth of our research.  Based on
strong client demand for a dedicated team and service focused on the
impending sea change for the power industry and our desire not to lessen the
service we provide to the natural gas industry and market in Europe, CERA is
pleased to announce the launch of the European  Power Advisory Service as of
1 April 2000. This new service, in combination with our existing European
Gas Advisory Service, will maintain CERA's thought leadership and provide
clients with an "early warning" system in these fast changing and important
markets.

The two teams will continue to work closely together, which will allow them
to identify and analyze the important aspects of "convergence" between the
gas and electric power markets while highlighting and researching the
independent issues in each market.

European Gas Advisory Service

The European Gas Advisory Service will continue to provide clients with
independent analysis and insight on the changing dynamics of the European
gas market. It offers decision makers clear and comprehensive analysis on
the future energy landscape and the challenges posed by the emerging
competitive environment in Europe. The focus is on market fundamentals, the
impact of European Union and national policies, the changing industry
structure, and strategic responses.

The deliverables include:

The semi-annual European Gas Watch
European Gas Decision Briefs
European Gas Private Reports
European Gas Energy Signposts
Interactive media conference calls
Dedicated European Gas website-highlighting CERA's current thinking and
market fundamentals on the gas sector in Europe on a country-by-country
basis.
Attendance at European Gas Roundtables (Optional)

European Power Advisory Service

The European Power Advisory Service will provide clients with independent
analysis and insight on the changing dynamics of the European power market.
The service will review the market fundamentals for the European electricity
market and will provide clients with a framework for understanding and
interpreting the major changes taking place in the market. European Power
Advisory Service will present CERA's view of the dynamics and assessment of
the opportunities being created in the market.

The deliverables will include:

A semi-annual European Power Watch
European Power Decision Briefs
European Power Private Reports
European Power Energy Signposts
Interactive media conference calls
Dedicated European Power website-highlighting CERA's current thinking and
market fundamentals on the power sector in Europe on a country-by-country
basis.
Attendance at European Power Roundtable (Optional)

We are pleased at this opportunity to enhance CERA's coverage of a rapidly
changing market and look forward to providing you with deeper and broader
perspectives on the future of European energy.

If you have any questions regarding this exciting transition, please contact
Mack Brothers* in our Paris office at +33 (0) 1 42 44 10 10. Also please
note the upcoming European Gas and European Power Roundtable sessions
scheduled for Monday 5 June 2000 in Paris. These roundtables commence at 9
a.m. and include dinner that evening.

* CERA is pleased to announce that as of 1 April 2000 Mack Brothers will be
moving from our Cambridge office to our Paris office to head the Commercial
team for European Energy.

Title: Extending EU Gas Guidelines to Central and Eastern Europe
URL: http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=3D35&m=3D2184


Overview: A comprehensive reform of gas legislation in Central and Eastern=
=20
Europe is bringing the region in line with the European Union=01,s Gas=20
Directive. This is true both for the countries expected to enter the Union =
by=20
2004=01)05=01*Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Poland, and Slovenia--and f=
or=20
candidates whose entry is not scheduled before the end of the=20
decade--Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, and Slovakia. In CERA=01,s vi=
ew=20
current developments regarding the establishment of a legal framework for t=
he=20
internal gas market in Eastern and Central Europe look promising from an=20
investor=01,s point of view.

The candidate countries presented a review of progress made in the=20
implementation of the EU Gas Directive during a two-day workshop held by th=
e=20
European Commission and the World Bank in Paris in November.

Many of these countries have been reforming their energy industries=20
throughout the 1990s as part of their transition to a market economy. The=
=20
results have been mixed, particularly in the utility industries. The 1998 G=
as=20
Directive (adopted in August 2000) now offers a compelling incentive for EU=
=20
candidate countries to transform their gas industries, while providing a ro=
ad=20
map to guide them.

The critical points relevant to harmonization between the European Union an=
d=20
candidate countries include the following:

* Legal framework and regulation. The legal framework is the cornerstone of=
=20
enlargement and the yardstick of harmonization in Europe. As a result, in a=
ll=20
candidate countries in 1999=01)2000 energy laws were either updated or newl=
y=20
established along the principles spelled out in the Gas Directive. Regulato=
ry=20
bodies have been created by law and are operating in every country, althoug=
h=20
issues of staffing, financial autonomy, and independence from political=20
influence are not uniformly resolved.

* Third-party access (TPA) and long-term take-or-pay contracts. All candida=
te=20
countries agree that TPA is a key to market competition. Therefore, all hav=
e=20
adopted it or intend to do so in their new legislation. Although the=20
Commission favors regulated TPA, the specific approaches to TPA enforcement=
=20
in the candidate countries remain unclear in some cases. In particular, the=
=20
implementation of TPA will have to address the issue of long-term take-or-p=
ay=20
contracts with Russia that were signed by all major domestic gas companies=
=20
and somewhat preempt competition. Russian gas is for the most part sold to=
=20
single, traditional state-owned operators that dominate their internal=20
markets. A balance will need to be struck between these incumbent dominant=
=20
players and the competitive environment. This is made more complicated by=
=20
their ownership of large volumes of Russian gas supplied in kind in exchang=
e=20
for transit rights to West European customers. Article 25 of the directive=
=20
provides for !
a derogation to companies experiencing difficulties stemming from take-or-p=
ay=20
obligations. This derogation would apply to the companies of candidate=20
countries with historical and commercial links with the Russian gas industr=
y.=20
Furthermore, article 26 allows derogations to those member states with only=
=20
one major gas supplier, to those with an =01+=01+emerging &#91;gas&#93; mar=
ket=20
status,=01,=01, or to those without a direct gas connection to the grid of =
another=20
member state. Most of the candidate countries would in principle be able to=
=20
call on one or more of these grounds for derogation when they join the=20
European Union.

* Price cross-subsidies. Residential gas tariffs are artificially low and a=
re=20
financed partially through higher rates applied to industrial consumers. In=
=20
various countries, tariff increases and the phasing out of subsidies have=
=20
been scheduled, but such decisions remain politically sensitive to enforce.=
=20
This has recently been emphasized by high gas prices owing to the linkage o=
f=20
imported gas to oil prices. All candidate countries have set legal framewor=
ks=20
that include the phasing out of cross-subsidies as part of sector reform, b=
ut=20
the actual implementation will remain politically difficult. As Table 1=20
indicates, price rebalancing is already under way in most countries expecte=
d=20
to enter the European Union by mid-decade, but the legal framework itself=
=20
cannot guarantee the pace of reform. The same goes for candidate countries=
=20
that have only recently introduced EU-complying energy laws and whose entry=
=20
to the European Union is likely to happen in a longer time frame.

* Unbundling. Most countries understand that the unbundling of transmission=
=20
companies from their supply businesses is the second critical element of=20
liberalization. To date, unbundling the accounts of these two businesses is=
=20
all that has been adopted by the member states or in the candidate countrie=
s.=20
In the future, the Commission is likely to press all EU countries for legal=
=20
separation (=01&structural unbundling=018) of the businesses, and candidate=
=20
countries will have to pursue their reform of the gas sector accordingly.

Table 1 gives an overview of the state of play in candidate countries. As t=
he=20
table shows, the countries belonging to the second group have only very=20
recently undertaken the reform of the gas sector in accordance with the=20
Directive, whereas change had been introduced earlier in the countries=20
scheduled for the first wave.

CERA Alert: December 15, 2000 

Title: Refined Products Line--North American Markets 
CERA Knowledge Areas: Refined Products 

US Margin Highlights 
* Responding to falling apparent demand and rising primary inventory levels, 
US Gulf Coast unleaded gasoline margins versus WTI fell by $2.26 per barrel 
to average $1.45 per barrel during November. Gasoline margins have returned 
to a historically normal range after spending the summer of 2000 at 
exceptionally high values. CERA expects gasoline margins to WTI to average 
$2.75 per barrel during the first quarter of the New Year, $1.16 per barrel 
lower than this year's first quarter average. 

* High sulfur No. 2 fuel oil differentials with WTI dropped slightly, 
averaging $5.97 per barrel in November. Despite the drop of $0.37 per barrel 
from October's average, fuel oil differentials remain at unprecedented 
values-$4.20 per barrel higher than a year ago and $3.46 per barrel greater 
that the previous five-year average. For the first quarter of 2001, CERA 
anticipates distillate margins to moderate somewhat but remain at a record 
high level of $4.75 per barrel in the first quarter.

* Jet/kerosene differentials versus WTI rose $0.63 per barrel from the 
October average, reaching a whopping $8.59 per barrel in November. In 
correspondence with the distillate market, jet/kerosene margins are at 
historically high levels and receiving support from relatively tight 
fundamentals. CERA expects jet/kerosene margins to moderate somewhat in the 
first quarter in response to seasonal weakening of demand following the 
holiday travel season but to remain exceptionally strong at an average of 
$5.75 per barrel.

* Margins for US Gulf Coast 1% sulfur residual fuel dropped by $2.15 per 
barrel, reaching $3.99 per barrel below WTI during November. Despite the 
recent widening of differentials, CERA expects soaring natural gas prices to 
support relatively narrow residual fuel differentials throughout the winter 
months. Residual fuel differentials are expected to average $2.50 per barrel 
below WTI during the first quarter of next year, at the high end of the 
historical range.

US Demand Highlights 
* Apparent demand for unleaded gasoline fell seasonally by about 0.5 million 
barrels per day (mbd) from the October level, reaching 8.36 mbd for the four 
weeks ending December 8. Demand is averaging less than 1 percent below last 
year largely because Y2K concerns helped inflate December demand a year ago. 
CERA anticipates gasoline demand to continue to decline seasonally as colder 
temperatures arrive, averaging 8.08 mbd during the first quarter of 2001.

* Reported distillate apparent demand remains exceptionally strong at 3.94 
mbd for the four weeks ending December 8, over 7 percent greater than this 
time last year. This represents a slight increase of about 0.05 million 
barrels (mb) from the end-October level of 3.90 mb, but still a record high 
level for early December. With support from low home heating oil inventories, 
particularly in the Northeast, distillate demand has been very strong during 
the fall of 2000. CERA expects demand to remain strong in the coming winter 
months, averaging 3.79 mb during the first quarter of next year. 

* Apparent demand for jet fuel declined by 5 percent from the October level 
to reach 1.68 mbd for the four weeks ending December 8. Despite the decline, 
apparent jet fuel demand is over 1 percent above the year-ago level. The 
relative strength of jet fuel reported demand continues to parallel 
distillate demand strength with support coming from the use of jet fuel to 
help mitigate the tight distillate market fundamentals. CERA expects the 
demand for jet fuel to average 1.81 mb during the fourth quarter. 

* Reported demand for residual fuel dropped to 0.87 mbd for the four weeks 
ending December 8, a decline of about 0.09 mbd from the October average and a 
slight increase over the November level. Demand for residual fuel is 
currently 11 percent greater than last year, and surging natural gas prices 
are expected to result in continued strong residual fuel demand throughout 
the winter. Residual fuel demand is expected to remain in the 0.85 to 0.9 mbd 
range during the first quarter of 2001.

US Inventory Highlights 
* Primary inventories of unleaded gasoline rose to 196.5 mb, increasing 
almost 10 mb from the end-October value. Responding to rising stock levels 
and declining apparent demand, forward supply coverage of gasoline climbed to 
23.5 days for the four weeks ending December 8. Forward supply is 2.5 percent 
below last year's level at this time of year and at its lowest level in the 
past eight years-although CERA still believes coverage is currently 
sufficient for the level of demand expected this winter. However, CERA is 
looking cautiously at the implications of high distillate refinery yields and 
production because of the possibility of low gasoline inventories at the 
start of the driving season in the second quarter of next year.

* Distillate inventory coverage has remained about level since the end of 
October at 29.2 days of forward supply for the four weeks ending December 8. 
Despite record high apparent demand, strong refinery production levels helped 
boost primary distillate inventories slightly, to 115.3 mb for this period. 
Primary stocks are 16 percent below last year's level at this time and at 
their lowest historical level ever. Although stocks are low, CERA does not 
anticipate shortages to occur this winter. Assuming normally cold weather, 
refinery production and net imports are expected to be capable of meeting 
demand requirements-albeit at a high price. 

* Jet fuel inventory coverage crept upward by about 1 day of coverage, to 
reach 25.7 days of forward supply for the four weeks ending December 8. This 
moves jet fuel coverage above the 23.5 to 25 days' supply range that it had 
been in for the past four months. The rise of just under 1 day in forward 
supply was mainly a response to a decline in apparent demand. Jet inventories 
and coverage are expected to become tighter in the coming weeks as the pull 
from tight distillate markets strengthen, but supplies are expected to be 
adequate for the winter.

* Inventory coverage of residual fuel rose by almost 4 days of forward supply 
from October, reaching 41.7 days of forward supply during the four weeks 
ending December 8. The increase in coverage was a temporary response to a 
drop in demand and an increase in stocks. With demand expected to strengthen 
because of colder weather and high gas prices, CERA looks for inventories and 
coverage gradually to decline in the coming weeks.

CERA Alert: December 13, 2000 

Title: California on the Brink 
CERA Knowledge Areas: Western Energy, N. American Power, N. American Gas 

CALIFORNIA ON THE BRINK 
The California Stalemate 
California moved closer to the brink of an outage today as concerns over 
credit-worthiness of buyers brought the possibility that generators would 
avoid selling to the California market. While numerous factors have 
contributed to the high cost of power incurred by California's utilities, the 
root cause of the current crisis is a lack of new generation. The current 
credit crisis and its threat to supplies could spark state action to address 
the situation. The collective efforts of all market participants should be 
focused on increasing generation capacity as quickly as possible.

Western power prices have skyrocketed well beyond the record levels set this 
summer. Perhaps because frozen rates insulate the majority of California 
consumers and companies from tangible effects of the market crisis, 
regulators have been able to postpone meaningful market reforms and 
significant rate increases. The California Public Utilities Commission denied 
the requests of Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison to end 
their rate freezes, forcing these utilities at least temporarily to finance 
the costs of higher wholesale energy. This has created an unsustainable 
accumulation of costs and a loss of faith in the California market. 

The current credit crisis and the potential for blackouts may become the 
galvanizing events that provide state regulators with a public mandate to 
address the underlying structural problems in the industry. However, there is 
no guarantee that these regulatory actions will expedite an effective 
solution for customers and the industry as a whole. Wholesale and retail 
markets that emerge from regulatory intervention are likely to remain 
muddled. In the necessarily political process that will follow, it is 
possible that-as has largely been the case so far-the steps taken will fail 
to move the California power market toward a more enduring solution and will 
instead continue to mask the underlying structural flaws. 

In the six months since California's supply shortfall began plaguing Western 
markets, regulators have done little to address the underlying problem. 
Rather than addressing the cause of the supply shortage-establishing a market 
environment that encourages timely additions of new generating capacity and 
demand side responses-efforts are instead directed at trying to lay blame for 
the crisis and lessen the immediate financial impact on customers. Indeed, 
several actions taken thus far have served more to compound the problem by 
discouraging new power plant additions. These include price caps, repeated 
changes to market rules, attempts to seize generator profits, and a 
challenging siting and permitting process.

Medicine Worse than the Illness 
Several years of electricity demand growth and low prices in California were 
accompanied by very few additions to the supply base. Regulators did not pay 
adequate attention to the looming supply shortfall. The void of consensus 
over the cause of the current crisis has instead been replaced by a series of 
bandaid remedies that address the symptoms, but not the cause, of 
California's electric market woes.* 

* Challenging siting and permitting. Despite state action to better 
coordinate the siting and permitting process for new power plants, power 
plant developers still face high hurdles. Local community opposition alone 
has struck down some key proposed facilities.

* Price caps discourage investment. State and federal proposals to cap prices 
limit the attractiveness of the California wholesale power market, especially 
for developers who have the option of channeling scarce capital and equipment 
to more stable or more attractive markets outside the state. 

* Repeated rule changes. Frequent rule changes in the ISO markets (including 
the price caps) confound attempts by developers to estimate profits from new 
plant development.

* Calls for refunds. Despite reports by the Power Exchange, the ISO, and the 
FERC that no pattern of abuse could be found from their examination of the 
California markets, state officials continue to accuse power providers of 
gaming the market. Calls by state officials for refunds of generator profits 
are a threat to new plant development.

* Facility inspections. Recent inspections of power plants by state officials 
to verify that operators are honestly reporting the operational status of 
their generating units accentuates the atmosphere of mistrust.

CERA's recent analysis suggests that merchant plant developers in the West 
are not guaranteed? to make a profit. Prospects of new plant profitability 
are affected by the timing and quantity of new plants, decommissioning of 
older units, demand growth, and numerous other difficult-to-forecast factors. 
California's regulatory actions only further cloud the assessment of 
financial viability and degrade the political environment for developers 
considering entering the state. 

Despite efforts by the California ISO to stimulate new capacity additions in 
the state with a special, limited-term capacity payment, CERA estimates that 
demand growth will continue to outstrip supply additions in the West in 2001. 
In addition, the existing siting and permitting process will prevent a 
sufficient quantity of capacity from entering the market until 2003 at the 
earliest. Therefore, three years remain before a sufficient quantity of 
capacity enters service to significantly dampen prices and decrease the risk 
of an outage. 

The Road to Recovery 
There are a number of actions that can be taken to help relieve the capacity 
shortfall: 

* Encourage new build. Supply must be part of the answer. This requires a 
series of steps that can help facilitate new supply build. While in principal 
some have been taken, such as new fast track approval, the success of these 
actions can only be measured by the build itself. For now, there is still not 
enough new supply coming on until 2003 to relieve supply tightness.? 

* Stabilize investment climate. Utilities must have assurance that they will 
ultimately be allowed to recover market costs for power. This provides the 
credit worthiness needed by sellers to produce energy and to stimulate new 
build.

* Move toward more balanced utility supply portfolios. One of the reasons the 
pressure on customers has been so intense in California has been the absence 
(and even discouragement) of diverse supply portfolios among the utilities in 
the state-particularly for residential and small commercial customers. With 
the market at a peak, however, now is in one sense a sub-optimal time to move 
toward term contracting. Yet these contracts provide the foundation for a 
series of actions-including new supply build and demand side investments. If 
they end up above market, they will at least have achieved the desired effect 
of knocking down prices, a fact which by itself should provide sufficient 
justification for recovering the cost of these commitments.

* Encourage market mechanisms that elicit a demand response. Although 
originally a feature of California's market design, most consumers are 
insulated from price spikes through capped or frozen retail rates. Exposing 
customers to at least some of the market price signals would encourage a 
demand response.

* Encourage market mechanisms that dampen the "Boom Bust" characteristic of 
the market. Whether in the form of a capacity payment, a reserve requirement, 
or a minimum term portfolio requirement, the California power market needs to 
move to a structure that encourages investment in new capacity when the 
market is in balance rather than waiting for a shortage and price shock to 
elicit new investment. Such a structure can help dampen (but not eliminate) 
future price volatility.

* Avoid continuously tinkering with the market. While the market does need to 
be restructured as described above, it also needs to be stable and reliable 
to encourage the development of new supply as well as a robust long-term 
contractual market for power in California. Continually tinkering with the 
market structure-such as the three times the price cap has been shifted since 
July-only serves to undermine confidence in the market. California needs to 
do its best to develop a long-term solution and then let the market run its 
course. 

* Allow for greater environmental flexibility. The state should explore a 
more balanced solution to emissions restrictions in the face of a supply 
shortfall that has been exacerbated by generators that cannot operate due to 
emissions restrictions. 

* Free PURPA power plants to generate. Relief should be granted to PURPA 
power plants that are operational, but are restricted by contract from 
operating to generate only power.

Title: A Colossal and Dangerous Failure
URL: http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=3D35&m=3D2185


Overview: WESTERN ENERGY=01*CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR STAYS THE COURSE
California governor Gray Davis provided his strongest public statements to=
=20
date regarding the state=01,s power crisis in his annual State of the State=
=20
Address on January 8, 2001. Echoing many of his previous positions on what =
he=20
perceives as a flawed and unfair California market structure, the governor=
=20
labeled the state=01,s electricity market system a colossal and dangerous=
=20
failure. Among other actions, he launched new initiatives valued at $1=20
billion to encourage conservation, provide financing and land to new=20
generators, grant authority to utilities to engage in a portfolio of=20
transactions to manage electricity costs, and increase regulatory scrutiny =
of=20
existing market suppliers. The governor also called for a greater role for=
=20
the state in overseeing and constructing new power plants.

The governor acknowledged that the actions proposed are only some of the=20
steps necessary to put California on the road to recovery. Details regardin=
g=20
sources of funding for the initiative are still forthcoming. Although he=20
stated that California=01,s investor-owned utilities must not be allowed to=
 go=20
bankrupt, no formal plan for ensuring their solvency was given. The financi=
al=20
community continues to lack the assurance it requires to continue to provid=
e=20
financial backing for Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California=20
Edison. At this time the state legislature remains the body most likely to=
=20
guarantee their solvency.

The governor again criticized the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for=
=20
what he believes has been its failure to manage and restrain properly the=
=20
wholesale market. Merchant plant generators were accused of gouging the=20
state, and it was suggested that these generators acted illegally in their=
=20
operations, jeopardizing the reliability of the power grid. New, more sever=
e=20
sanctions were promised for those caught withholding power or extracting wh=
at=20
investigators find as unreasonable profits.

A Los Angeles Times poll released the morning before the governor=01,s addr=
ess=20
indicated that the majority of Californians still do not believe there is a=
n=20
energy crisis. Although the 33 percent growth in the state=01,s economy ove=
r the=20
past ten years has nearly outstripped the state=01,s and surrounding region=
=01,s=20
supplies of power, the bulk of the governor=01,s statements continue to foc=
us on=20
the culpability of power producers, rather than the serious supply shortfal=
l.

Though the governor introduced steps to fund and facilitate the constructio=
n=20
of new generating plants, increased regulatory scrutiny and the threat of=
=20
sanctions will exacerbate the concern already expressed by plant developers=
=20
and the financial community that the investment climate in California is=20
excessively risky.
