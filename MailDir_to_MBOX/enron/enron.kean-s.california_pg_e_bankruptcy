All:

PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) performed a proprietary analysis for the Creditors Committee.   I have had a chance to overlay this PWC projection of PG&E's revenue requirement to cover retained generation, QF and bilaterals, an estimate of the undercollection and the DWR revenue requirement to analyze the sufficiency (headroom) in current rates.   Note, there is a outstanding rate case on the generation component of rates for the IOU's.   I included three sections below.  The first illustrates that unevenness of DWR's cash needs.   The second displays the costs across all sales volumes.   The third displays unit costs based on PG&E and DWR's revenue flows and their volumes provided.  

This analysis indicates that there is a slight amount of headroom for PG&E (0.254 cents).  


1. The DWR Revenue Recovery allocated to PG&E is as follows (along with a Last Twelve Months running balance):

                          Revenue
Quarter   Revenue (thd)  LTM (thd)

Q1 2001    $  105,118
Q2 2001    $  382,142
Q3 2001    $  612,808
Q4 2001    $1,031,244   $2,131,312
Q1 2002    $  924,185   $2,950,379
Q2 2002    $  583,401   $3,151,638
Q3 2002    $  695,644   $3,234,474
Q4 2002    $  863,144   $3,066,374


2. Assuming the 2002 DWR revenue requirement, a large amount of undercollection recovery at $6 Bln ($8.5 Bln minus $2.5 Bln in cash) and using PWC's projection, across all amounts billed:

                                         Sales     Rate     Revenue
                                         (GWh)   (per Mwh)  ($ Bln)
a) PWC Retained Gen, QF & Bilaterals     75,537    4.003     3.024 
b) Amortize $6 Bln, 12 years at 7.5%     75,537    1.001     0.756
c) DWR requirement                       75,537    4.059     3.066
d) Headroom in existing rates            75,537    0.254     0.192          

e) Total                                 75,537    9.317     7.038



3. Looking at the revenue on the volumes provided (PG&E at 46,881 GWh and DWR at 28,656 GWh) yields:

                                         Sales     Rate     Revenue
                                         (GWh)   (per Mwh)  ($ Bln)
a) PWC Retained Gen, QF & Bilaterals     46,881    6.451     3.024 
b) Amortize $6 Bln, 12 years at 7.5%     46,881    1.613     0.756
c) DWR requirement                       28,656   10.699     3.066
d) Headroom in existing rates            75,537    0.254     0.192          

e) Total                                 75,537    9.317     7.038



Note interest is capitalized until Sept 1, 2002 and the principal payments into the Debt Service Account do not begin until March 1, 2003.  If spot purchase curves do not move, there could be some relief by this price backwardation in 2003 from the mounting debt service cash needs at DWR.  



Regards,


Michael

The statements aren't different from what we've been saying on analyst calls, 
in interviews, and in speeches for the past three months.  On the second 
statement, I expect people to stick to the statement.  We don't need to say 
anything else.

Here's Calpine's announcement, fyi...


PG&E Bankruptcy Will Not Affect Calpine's Commitment to California Power 
Market
/FROM PR NEWSWIRE SAN FRANCISCO  415-543-7800/

TO BUSINESS AND ENERGY EDITORS:

PG&E Bankruptcy Will Not Affect Calpine's Commitment to California

Power Market

SAN JOSE, Calif., April 9 /PRNewswire/ -- In response to Pacific Gas and
Electric Company's (PG&E) April 6th Chapter 11 filing, Calpine Corporation
(NYSE: CPN), the San Jose, Calif.-based independent power company, stated it
is confident that PG&E, through a successful reorganization, will be able to
pay Calpine's Qualifying Facility (QF) subsidiaries for all past due power
sales, in addition to electricity deliveries made on a going-forward basis.

CALPINE'S QF SUBSIDIARIES SELL POWER TO PG&E UNDER THE TERMS OF LONG-TERM
QF CONTRACTS AT ELEVEN FACILITIES, REPRESENTING NEARLY 600 MEGAWATTS OF
ELECTRICITY FOR NORTHERN CALIFORNIA POWER CUSTOMERS.  AS OF MARCH 31, 2001,
CALPINE HAS RECORDED APPROXIMATELY $267 MILLION IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WITH
PG&E, PLUS A $68 MILLION NOTE RECEIVABLE NOT YET DUE AND PAYABLE.  THE
COMPANY'S REMAINING CALIFORNIA OPERATIONS, TOTALING APPROXIMATELY 700 
MEGAWATTS OF CAPACITY, PROVIDE ELECTRICITY TO MUNICIPALITIES AND OTHER 
CREDITWORTHY THIRD PARTIES.

CALPINE'S QF FACILITIES ARE PART OF A 9,000-MEGAWATT QF SUPPLY THAT
PROVIDE CALIFORNIA CUSTOMERS WITH A LONG-TERM SOURCE OF ELECTRICITY AT PRICES
SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW CURRENT WHOLESALE PRICES.  THIS CRITICAL POWER SUPPLY
REPRESENTS APPROXIMATELY 33 PERCENT OF THE STATE'S POWER DEMAND.  WITHOUT
THESE CONTRACTS IN PLACE FOR THIS SUMMER, CALIFORNIA FACES THE PROSPECT OF
MORE BLACKOUTS AND HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN INCREASED COSTS.

FOR THESE QF CONTRACTS TO CONTINUE, PG&E MUST ASSUME THE CONTRACTS IN THE
BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS.  IN ORDER TO ASSUME THESE CONTRACTS, PG&E WILL BE
REQUIRED TO CURE ALL OUTSTANDING DEFAULTS, INCLUDING PAYING ALL PAST DUE
AMOUNTS.  IF PG&E FAILS TO ASSUME THE CONTRACTS, CALPINE'S QF SUBSIDIARIES
WILL BE ABLE TO SELL POWER ON THE OPEN MARKET AND SEEK DAMAGES FROM PG&E FOR
BREACH OF CONTRACT THROUGH THE BANKRUPTCY CLAIMS RESOLUTION PROCESS.

"As the state's leading developer of new electric generating facilities,
Calpine remains committed to providing innovative solutions for California's

Subject: Early Sacramento Reaction to PG&E Plan of Reorganization


Since the POR was filed, we've had many conversations with State legislator=
s, key staffers, legal advisors and members of the inner circle of the Gove=
rnor's energy team.  While the cumulative reaction has been generally negat=
ive, it has been reasonably restrained at the same time.  The Company and w=
e strongly recommended that no one at the State draw any lines in the sand =
until we (Company/creditors) have had a chance to explain why the POR makes=
 sense and why it will succeed in spite of State objections to the contrary=
.
=20
The State issues break down into three categories:  public policy, regulato=
ry and statutory.=20
=20
Public Policy=20
=20
The POR is an affront to State officials who feel that the State went out o=
f its way in AB1x to bolster up noncreditworthy IOU's by providing an alter=
native means to buy power when no one would deal with the IOU's themselves.=
   In response to that move, they see PG&E (1) pulling things out of PUC ju=
risdiction, where they have been forever; and (2) doing so while also quest=
ioning the DWR revenue requirements, thus putting a chilling effect on the =
AB1x bond deal.  These twin acts have understandably spawned a bitter "this=
 is thanks we get?" response from a number of State officials. =20
=20
The State can see why the POR is attractive to the Company and the creditor=
s.  At the same time, they think that it is a very bad plan for consumers. =
 Notwithstanding public comments by the Company to the contrary, they feel =
sure that somehow the POR will result in increased rates.
=20
Unlike the SCE legislation, they don't see the POR giving generators the ha=
ircut "they deserve."  They understand that the generators will only get "a=
llowed claims," but do not view that as sufficient "punishment" for gouging=
 the public.
=20
There is concern that if GenCo goes under FERC jurisdiction, the stage will=
 be set down the road for sale of the hydro assets to a third party ("Enron=
," for example).  Such a transfer will put valuable generating assets in th=
e hands of a third party that has no accountability to the State.
=20
Finally, they are worried that SCE might find the POR attractive and file t=
hemselves, thereby mooting months worth of legislative effort.
=20
Regulatory
=20
Citing various PUC determinations from the past, certain State officials fe=
el that the POR contravenes State regulations (1) against using operating c=
ash to pay undercollections; (2) that mandate that any transfer of assets f=
irst get PUC approval; and (3) that realized value from the transfer of ass=
ets goes to the ratepayer, not the utility.  Begging the question of whethe=
r or not there is a true "transfer" of assets, none of these arguments take=
 into account federal preemption, which is, of course, the key to the whole=
 Plan.
=20
Statutory
=20
AB6x passed earlier this year puts a moratorium on the transfer of IOU asse=
ts for five years.  As before, focusing on this legislation ignores the pre=
emption issue.
=20
Specific Stakeholder Responses
=20
Of the various State parties voicing concern, the PUC, as expected, is the =
most vocal.  While they have expressed outrage and are expected to fight th=
e POR tooth and nail, it is worth noting that their counsel had remarks in =
the SF Chronicle were at worst neutral.  The Governor is studying the plan =
and has thus far been measured in his response.  Given his penchant for tak=
ing firm positions when he disagrees with something (and with the caveat th=
at this may be the calm before the storm), his comments suggest that he may=
 have at least some concern that the POR has legs.   A number of the legisl=
ators share the concerns set forth above, but have confined their public co=
mments to the possibility that rates will rise.  A couple of their key advi=
sors (bankruptcy counsel and CSFB), though, have preliminarily noted that t=
he Plan has a number of "clever" and "attractive" features.  That isn't to =
say they buy off on the Plan, but by not denouncing it up front (indeed, th=
e contrary has been true), they have helped get the State stakeholders to m=
oderate their responses pending further review.   Lastly, the consumer grou=
ps are totally opposed to the POR and remain convinced that they will get s=
tuck in the end with major rate increases.
=20
The net effect of all this at the State level (at least, among the leadersh=
ip) is an even greater sense of urgency to get something done for SCE.  Tha=
t, of course, is much easier said than done (see today's LA Times article o=
n page one of the California section outlining the major rift between the G=
overnor and Senator Burton).  Given that the PG&E bankruptcy has not been t=
he disaster anticipated either from the standpoint of service to users or e=
conomically (PG&E parent stock has fared much better than Edison parent sto=
ck since PG&E filed on April 6), an increasing number of legislators ask th=
emselves "why should we stick our necks out to protect SCE?" and "maybe ban=
kruptcy isn't such a bad thing after all."  So we'll see.  The Governor's t=
hird extraordinary session is due to start sometime soon.  We'll be keeping=
 a close eye on that.
=20
In the meantime, we are going to continue our discussions with the State.  =
We are coordinating those discussions with the Company, to make sure we're =
on the same page.  The goal remains to get the State to see the wisdom of t=
he Plan and to minimize their opposition to the greatest extent possible.  =
I'll keep you posted...

Davis sues Bush: If logic and science prevail, ethanol goes



(Published Aug. 15, 2001) 

It would be environmental and economic lunacy for California to blend oxygen-boosting ethanol into state gasoline supplies, as the federal government stubbornly and blindly requires. But for politically influential Midwestern farmers, the federal fuel rule is a pipeline into Californians' pocketbooks. They grow the corn from which ethanol is made. 

Last month, when the Bush administration rejected California's request to waive the fuel rule, it clearly sided with Midwestern farmers against California and common sense. Now, in defense of California's economy and its environment, Gov. Gray Davis has sued the federal regulators. Good for him. 

On the environmental side, California air regulators -- hardly slouches in the nation's clean air fight -- offer persuasive evidence that state refiners can produce a gasoline blend that exceeds federal clean air standards without using an oxygenate. MTBE, the oxygenate currently used in state gasoline, has been a source of serious water pollution. The Davis administration has wisely ordered a phaseout of MTBE by 2003. 

Studies show that ethanol, the most readily available alternative to MTBE, could actually harm California's air. While it reduces carbon monoxide like other oxygenates, ethanol increases soot and emissions of nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds, the major ingredients in smog and the state's most persistent air pollutants. 

Ethanol imposes economic burdens as well. To produce an ethanol blend, refiners in California would have to convert their refineries at an estimated cost of $1 billion. That could add 3 cents to 5 cents extra to a gallon of gasoline at minimum. If the federal mandate remains in place, California's fuel needs would push demand for ethanol well beyond current supplies, driving prices up an additional 50 cents per gallon by some estimates. That would be an economic boon for Midwestern farmers, but a hardship for California consumers. In a state already reeling from an electricity crisis and a slowdown in its high tech sector, higher gas prices would be an unfair and unnecessary burden. 

California's message to the federal courts is simple: Let logic and science prevail. If that happens, California should win.



 

 

 

PUC turns spotlight on SDG&E debt deal

Hearing to examine plan negotiated by governor

By Craig D. Rose 
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER 

August 15, 2001 

Even though California has avoided rolling blackouts since May, for consumers, the electricity crisis hasn't disappeared. 

The California Public Utilities Commission has scheduled a hearing tomorrow at San Diego City Hall on the deal between Gov. Gray Davis and Sempra Energy, the parent company of San Diego Gas & Electric, to do away with a $747 million debt racked up by customers. 

If paid in full, the debt will cost residential customers about $400 each and every business between $1,400 and $12,000. 

Consumer groups say the debt is fictitious -- the result of selective bookkeeping by SDG&E. The San Diego-based Utility Consumers' Action Network says ratepayers really owe nothing. 

Here are the issues in the dispute: 

What is the deal between Davis and Sempra all about? 

When rates for SDG&E's electricity customers tripled last summer because of the state's deregulation law, the Legislature put a cap on customer payments. SDG&E continued to pay sky-high prices for power but could only collect a portion of those costs from customers. 

The company kept track of the shortfall in what is known as a balancing account. Davis and SDG&E have agreed on a plan to eliminate the debt and avoid charging customers a huge balloon payment. 

Consumer advocates say the plan amounts to ratepayer gouging. The deal requires PUC approval. 

What is the source of the dispute over the debt? 

It has to do with accounting, and it's a multimillion-dollar difference of opinion. 

A key disagreement is what should be done with hundreds of millions of dollars in profits SDG&E made by selling power during the crisis. The PUC twice this year said profits from two contracts should be returned to customers. 

UCAN says the profits amount to $450 million and says SDG&E misled the public by portraying itself as simply a distributor of power. The utility says the disputed contracts belong to stockholders and has refused to disclose their value. SDG&E points out that the agreement calls for it to contribute $219 million of the profits to the state and that the state has audited the contracts regularly. 

Didn't SDG&E say it was passing along the cost of power without any markup? So how did it make the profits? 

As required under law at the time, SDG&E bought power for its customers from the state Power Exchange and passed along those costs without markup. However, SDG&E was also selling electricity into the Power Exchange at that time. 

SDG&E says the PUC earlier allowed it to keep these gains. The commission says it never granted such approval and ordered the profits returned to customers. The company is challenging that order in court. 

What does the law say? 

Under the law passed last fall that capped customer payments to SDG&E, the utility is to be repaid for shortfalls, if it prudently purchased electricity. 

The law also states that any losses incurred by SDG&E should be offset by profits derived from buying less expensive power for its customers, such as the electricity purchased under the disputed contracts. 

If that's what the law says and the commission has already ruled on these profits, why isn't the matter settled? 

The deal worked out between Davis and Sempra Energy asks the PUC to reverse its earlier ruling and award the contract profits to company shareholders. 

Two more provisions are key: SDG&E says it will contribute $219 million to reduce the customer debt. But SDG&E will also earn an additional $120 million from selling power to the state from June till the end of the year. 

Why would the governor push to reverse a commission ruling that could bring even more to consumers? 

SDG&E has filed an appeal in state court to overturn the commission ruling on the power-sale profits. The utility says it convinced Davis' negotiators that it has a strong case and would win in court. If that occurred, none of profits would go to consumers. 

UCAN and the state Office of Ratepayer Advocates, an arm of the PUC, say it is unlikely that SDG&E would prevail. 

What does SDG&E say? 

The utility says the deal is a fair compromise and good for consumers because it eliminates the possibility of lengthy litigation over several issues. 

SDG&E obtained electricity at below-market rates over the past year because it entered into the power-buying contracts several years ago, before rates skyrocketed. SDG&E says that if energy prices had dropped and the contracts turned out to be a bad deal, the utility and its stockholders would be liable, not ratepayers. 

Conversely, when the contracts turn a profit, the utility contends its stockholders should benefit. SDG&E also points to the $319 million in concessions it agreed to in the pact with Davis -- $219 million in returned profits and an additional $100 million in penalties to settle unrelated charges that it improperly purchased power on customers' behalf. 

What do consumer groups say? 

UCAN says all SDG&E profits from selling power should be returned to customers. The group also says the $100 million in penalties is a good deal for the utility because state regulators had not finished their review of SDG&E purchasing practices. 

What happens tomorrow? 

The PUC will hold a hearing over the plan to resolve the debt. The meeting runs from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. in the San Diego City Council chambers, on the 12th floor of the City Administration Building, 202 C St. Members of the public can testify between 2 and 4 p.m. 

The commission is not scheduled to vote on the issue until Aug. 23. Other provisions of the Davis-Sempra agreement will be considered separately later this year. 

What's the deadline for paying the debt claimed by SDG&E? 

Under the law passed last fall, SDG&E must wait at least until the end of next year for payment of any undercollections. And the utilities commission can bump the payment deadline one more year to the end of 2003. 

Why are we dealing with this now? 

Both Davis and SDG&E said they were motivated by customer concerns over so large a debt hanging over consumers' heads. Political observers say Davis is eager to settle the debt now so it is less likely to be an issue when he seeks re-election next year. 

What does the city of San Diego say? 

Along with UCAN, the city intervened in the suit seeking to recover the disputed SDG&E profits for residents. But San Diego will not take a position on the proposed deal to settle the debt because it does not have sufficient information, City Attorney Casey Gwinn said.


 
 
 
 
 
 
SoCalEd owes $3.3 billion, raises specter of bankruptcy

ROSEMEAD, Calif. - The struggling utility Southern California Edison owes $3.3 billion for power and other costs, has only about $1.7 billion of cash, and may be unable to avoid bankruptcy if it does not get help, its corporate parent said on Tuesday in a regulatory filing. 

SoCal Edison, left nearly insolvent amid California's power crisis, remains "unable to obtain financing of any kind," the parent, Edison International, said in its quarterly report, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Deregulation left SoCal Edison and the larger Pacific Gas & Electric Co. unable to recoup their soaring wholesale power costs. 

SoCal Edison agreed in April with Gov. Gray Davis on a rescue plan, known as the "Memorandum of Understanding," or MOU, which called on the state to buy the company's transmission assets and called for the utility to sell ratepayer-secured bonds. This required approval by the California legislature and the rate-making California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC). 

The MOU expires on Wednesday, five days before the legislature returns from recess. Rosemead, California-based Edison is meeting with state officials in the meantime. 

"SCE's future liquidity depends, in large part, on whether the MOU is implemented, or other action by the California legislature and the CPUC is taken in a manner sufficient to resolve the energy crisis and the cash flow deficit," Edison said in the filing. 

"Without a change in circumstances ... resolution of SCE's liquidity crisis and its ability to continue to operate outside of bankruptcy is uncertain," it added. 

According to the filing, as of July 31 SoCal Edison owed: 

- $1.2 billion to power generators known as "qualifying facilities;" 

- $878 million to the California Power Exchange, a clearinghouse for electricity buyers and sellers, and the California Independent System Operator, which runs most of the state's power grid; 

- $531 million on matured, defaulted commercial paper; 

- $230 million of energy credits; 

- $400 million of two defaulted note issues. 

The latest filing shows a deterioration in the company's financial situation in the past three months. As of April 30, SoCal Edison owed $3.1 billion for power and other costs and had about $1.9 billion of cash, according to an earlier regulatory filing. 

Pacific Gas, a unit of San Francisco-based PG&E Corp. , filed for bankruptcy protection on April 6.

Governor appointee liquidates stocks / DISCLOSURE: Her divestment was made after 'crusade'

FINAL 
Page A.1

California 's chief environmental official and head of the agency that has purchased billions of dollars in power acknowledged yesterday that she recently owned stock in energy firms while they were selling electricity to the state. 

Mary Nichols was appointed by Gov. Gray Davis as secretary of the state Resources Agency, which has political control over the Energy Commission and the Department of Water Resources, both of which exert tremendous power over California energy policy. 

Stanley Young, a spokesman for Nichols, said the investments did not represent a conflict of interest, but Nichols nevertheless sold all the energy stocks two weeks ago "when we realized there was this crusade" to review the statements of economic interest filed by Davis administration officials. 

The disclosure comes amid a series of revelations about Davis appointees who have owned energy company stocks at the same time they were making energy policy or orchestrating the purchase of power for California . The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating possible conflicts within the administration. 

"It's a troubling pattern within the Davis administration," said Jim Knox, executive director of Common Cause, "which seems to place a very low priority on identifying and avoiding potential conflicts." 

Young said the energy stock belonged to Nichols' husband, John F. Daum, a partner in a Los Angeles law firm. Until two weeks ago, the couple owned stock in Enron, the world's largest energy trader, in power generators Williams Co. and Puget Sound Energy and in oil giant Chevron, all of which have financial interests in the workings of her energy-related departments. 

Nichols was not required to list the number of shares owned or the value of the energy stocks, only a range. According to her economic disclosure statement filed in March, the stock's value was somewhere between $40,000 and $400,000. 

Nichols and her husband have numerous other stock holdings, including substantial interests in Eli Lilly and Co., a pharmaceutical firm, Oracle, Time Warner, Worldcom Inc. long distance, Corning manufacturing and Wells Fargo Co. 

STOCKS BOUGHT BEFORE CRISIS 

The financial disclosure forms show that Nichols held her energy stocks well before California was plunged into crisis late last year when energy companies began charging unprecedented prices for power. The most recent purchase was her stock in Enron on May 24, 2000, listed at between $10,001 and $100,000, and the Williams Co. purchase on Aug. 9, 2000, also valued in the same range. 

The state Department of Water Resources has been steadily purchasing power for California consumers, filling a gap left by the financial failure of the state's investor-owned utilities. An estimated $43 billion in long-term power contracts have been signed, including one with Williams Co. The California Energy Commission has been working to speed construction of new power plants. 

Young said that Nichols' energy stock was sold to avoid the appearance of impropriety and that "the secretary has absolutely no say over the individual purchase of energy or decisions on the siting of (power plants) or the negotiating of contracts." 

'NO IMPROPRIETY HERE' 

"She is at an extremely high level in the development of the policies of departments under her purview," Young said. "From that respect, there is absolutely no impropriety here regarding her holding these stocks." 

State law requires that public officials stay clear of decisions that could affect their investments. But many exceptions are made, including if the public official avoids work or public statements that might directly change the value of their stock holdings. 

"(Nichols) has control, but the key is whether she is actually making decisions with regards to energy contracts or purchases," Knox said. "If she was in a decision-making capacity, then she would have conflict." 

$311 MILLION DEAL WITH WILLIAMS 

A review of the first three months of spot market purchases by the state shows that the Department of Water Resources bought just over a million megawatts of power from Williams for $311 million. The average price worked out to be $278 a megawatt hour. 

The agency also bought 246,800 megawatts of power from Enron for $45 million, or an average of $181 a megawatt hour. Puget Sound sold California 100 megawatts during the height of the power crisis in January for $40,000, or $400 a megawatt hour. 

Puget Energy Inc. is the holding company for Puget Sound Energy, a regulated utility providing electric and gas service to Western Washington, and InfrastruX, which provides contracting services to the electric power, telecommunications and natural gas industries. 

The reports also showed that Nichols owned between $10,001 and $100,000 in General Electric Co. stock, but Young could not immediately confirm whether the stock was sold two weeks ago by Nichols and her husband. The stock was purchased in December 2000. 

G.E. is a major manufacturer of gas turbine generators that are in short supply and vital for the operation of power plants being built around California . 

Without commenting on whether Nichols violated any ethics rules, Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean said the state Fair Political Practices Commission has ultimate authority over any possible conflict with any state official.

Pricing plan is guilt by association / BILLING: New system backfires on thrifty homeowners group
Matthew Yi

The San Francisco Chronicle

Emeryville's Watergate Community Association is no energy hog, although it's being treated like one. 

Timothy Sutherland, general manager of the homeowners group, has been dimming hallway lights, installing motion sensor light switches and screwing in low-wattage bulbs -- all in hopes of cutting back energy use. 

It has worked. He's shaved off about 10 percent in electricity usage compared with a year ago. 

But he just about had a heart attack when he saw the June bill from Pacific Gas and Electric Co., the same kind of shock being felt throughout California this summer as many homeowners associations peek warily at their PG&E bills. 

Sutherland's June bill doubled to nearly $30,000, and he can blame the California Public Utilities Commission, which in May approved a five-tier electricity -rate increase designed to punish power hogs. 

But the 1,249-home Watergate is more of a miser than a hog -- so why the humongous bill? It's a classic Catch 22. Because all of the Watergate's common-area power usage is routed into just 11 PG&E meters and because each of those meters has relatively low baseline levels, the excess electricity is being charged at much higher amounts. 

In the past, those meters didn't even have baseline amounts. Now, with the new five-tier rate system, the same meters are alloted baseline levels similar to a single-family home's. Go over those baselines -- and the Watergate does by leaps and bounds -- and your electricity bill goes through the roof. 

"Once they made that decision, they threw the baby out with the bathwater," Sutherland said of the PUC. "It's completely unfair. . . . It's a way of saying common interest developments must pay the highest (energy) rate allowed by law." 

Homeowners associations that manage large condominium buildings or townhouse complexes with lots of amenities, such as power-draining swimming pools, are being hit the hardest. 

"We're starting to get calls from our members," said Karen D. Conlon, president of the California Association of Community Managers. "Basically, people are saying their ( electricity ) bills have doubled." 

California has 33,000 homeowners associations, and about 8.5 million residents are believed to be a part of one, she said. 

Because annual budgets are already set for most associations, managers are left to dip into reserve funds while stalling renovation projects and freezing staff hiring, Conlon said. 

Unless the PUC comes up with a solution quickly, the increased costs would inevitably be passed on to residents when new budgets are set for next year, she said. 

BOOSTING FEES 

In San Francisco, at least one condominium complex has increased the monthly homeowners association fee by 10 percent to cover electricity bills that have skyrocketed by 80 percent. 

"If we didn't, we would have a deficit," said Pat Clock, general manager at Opera Plaza, which has 451 units in three separate towers on Van Ness Avenue and Turk Street. "And that's what a lot of people are doing around here." 

At the Watergate buildings, under the new tiered system, each of the 11 meters was allotted only 7.7 kilowatt hours of baseline power per day in June and 10.4 kilowatt hours in July. The baseline takes into account variables such as climate and season. 

But with 7,098 light bulbs illuminating 6.4 miles of hallways, 27 elevators, 27 building lobbies and stairwells; 45 light fixtures shining on four streets and 353 parking spaces; lighting for six parking garages with 1,300 parking spaces and a 20,500-square-foot bayfront boardwalk, Watergate is way beyond the top tier of 300 percent above the baseline. 

In June, when the new baseline levels went into effect, Watergate's usage was 5,000 percent over the limit, and in July, more than 4,000 percent over the baseline. 

"It doesn't make any sense. We don't mind paying more if we use more, but if we use less than prior years, we shouldn't be paying more," Sutherland said. 

PLEA FOR HELP 

Last month, he fired off letters detailing Watergate's woes to the state PUC, PG&E and state public officials, including Gov. Gray Davis. 

So far, nobody has written back. 

Representatives of both PG&E and the governor's office told The Chronicle that it is a PUC problem. 

Paul Clanon, the PUC's energy division director, called the conundrum an "unintended" consequence. 

"Nobody anticipated (this) was going to happen," Clanon said. "I wouldn't point any fingers. . . . We understand the problem and we're looking at how to fix it." 

The PUC has received numerous complaints from managers of homeowners associations, Clanon said. The issue will be addressed in public hearings later this year as the commission grapples with a variety of complaints about the new tiered system. 

ADJUSTING THE BASELINE 

Many argue that the baseline levels need to be reformulated because they haven't been updated since 1994. 

One possible solution for homeowners groups is to simply give them higher baselines, said Clanon. But until there's a fix, the bills will have to be paid. And refunds down the road aren't in the cards, he said. 

Not all homeowners associations are griping. 

At the mammoth Woodbridge Village Association in the Orange County community of Irvine, encompassing 9,000 single-family homes, Executive Director Bob Figeira isn't fretting. 

Despite having 50 swimming pools, 35 parks, 24 tennis courts, 11 volleyball courts and two lakes, the local grid is divided among more than 100 electric meters -- each with separate bills. 

"We're all divided, so each one of those meters uses less power than a single home," Figeira said. "But I could see how some associations might have some big problems. . . . Some of these (associations) will go broke if it goes on like this."

Bush names Texan to chair energy panel

President Bush completed a long-expected change of leadership at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission yesterday by naming his friend and fellow Texan Patrick Wood III as chairman of the much- criticized agency that oversees the nation's energy system. 

Wood, nominated to the commission by Bush in April, will replace Chairman Curt Hebert Jr., who announced last week that he will resign Aug. 31. 

In an interview with The Chronicle, Wood agreed with critics who say the agency has failed to monitor and respond to market abuses by energy firms -- a problem he says he will address immediately. 

"It requires a certain level of aggressiveness that we have not done," Wood said. 

The soon-to-be chairman said he is already working with Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., to add $6 million to next year's regulatory commission budget. Wood said he will use the money to hire traders and other energy company employees to work for the government as watchdogs. 

"The best kind of hire would be someone who has done this on the other side," he said. 

By appointing Wood, Bush installed an ally at the helm of the agency, which has been sharply criticized for not responding to skyrocketing energy prices in California and the West over the past year. Wood was chairman of the Texas Public Utility Commission when Bush was governor. 

Wood has also found an unlikely ally in Gov. Gray Davis, who has bashed federal regulators but praised the Texas regulator as someone who could improve the agency's response to the state's energy woes. 

"The governor has generally felt that Pat Wood has been very open and receptive to at least listening to what California 's issues are," said Roger Salazar, a spokesman for Davis. 

Wood said yesterday that his job had been made easier by the efforts of California consumers to conserve energy. He praised the governor, the utilities and the California Public Utilities Commission for their efforts to stave off blackouts. 

"I've been proud of what California has done in terms of energy conservation," Wood said. "I think that's going to be the story of the summer." 

But Wood also praised what he called the "much-vilified Texas generators" for keeping their plants running to keep power flowing to the electricity grid. 

Despite his cozier relations with the state, Wood may clash with Davis and other California leaders on some key issues. 

Those include California 's claim it is owed $9 billion in alleged overcharges for electricity , an issue before a regulatory commission administrative law judge. 

"If the parties want to settle, fine," Wood said. "We've given them a deadline. . . . We just need to do that and get it over with and move on to something more positive and future-oriented."

Enron's CEO Steps Down After 6 Months Energy: Jeffrey K. Skilling cites personal reasons for his abrupt departure, which follows several setbacks for the power giant.

NEW YORK -- Jeffrey K. Skilling stunned the energy industry by abruptly resigning Tuesday as chief executive of energy-trading giant Enron Corp., barely six months into a job for which he'd been groomed for years. 

Skilling's departure follows a series of setbacks for Enron, including seeing its huge investment in the fiber-optic telecommunications sector turn sour and facing accusations of electricity price-gouging in California . The company's stock price has lost half its value this year. 

Skilling, 48, called his resignation "a purely personal decision" having "nothing to do with Enron." 

By leaving voluntarily, Skilling will forfeit a severance package that would have been worth several million dollars. The normally outspoken Skilling declined to offer further explanation, prompting analysts to ask whether another shoe might drop. 

Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay told reporters and analysts in a conference call Tuesday evening that he would immediately assume Skilling's duties and extend his own employment contract by two years, through 2005, to provide ample time to craft a succession plan. 

Skilling and Lay were the main architects of Enron's spectacular transformation from a natural-gas pipeline firm into a lean, high-tech trader of everything from oil to wood pulp to pollution credits. 

Though solidly profitable and much admired for its innovativeness, Enron has stumbled lately and seen its stock price decline from a peak of $90.75 last August. 

Shares of Houston-based Enron closed at $42.93 on Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange, up 78 cents. However, the stock tumbled in after-hours trading on word of Skilling's resignation, which came after the market close. 

A major setback has been the near-collapse of the telecommunications sector, where Enron had made a big push into the trading of fiber-optic bandwidth. A promising start for that business quickly turned into losses that reached $102 million before taxes in the quarter just ended. 

"It's very clear that they have been struggling with their business model of late," Raymond James analyst Frederick Schultz said Tuesday night. 

Enron is one of the independent power suppliers accused by California officials of price-gouging during the state's electricity crisis. In the meantime, however, natural gas and electricity prices have fallen, and Wall Street has grown concerned that federal efforts to push for energy price caps will affect long-term growth. 

Skilling's sudden departure may anger some institutional investors, Schultz said, since the executive has spent time in recent months wooing mutual funds and pension funds to invest in Enron stock. 

The analysts and reporters for the trade publications that follow Enron most closely seemed flummoxed by Tuesday's developments. 

Curt N. Launer of Credit Suisse First Boston asked whether the company anticipated filing "any disclosure to tell us any other items behind this surprising news." 

"There's nothing to disclose," Skilling replied. "The company's in great shape." 

Prudential Securities analyst M. Carol Coale found Skilling's timing odd, in that he was recently engaged to be married and has just completed construction of a large home in Houston. 

"Something's just not sitting right with me," she said. "It seems odd that he would walk away from a severance worth millions." 

Lay explained during the conference call that the severance pay called for in Skilling's contract, which expires in 2003, does not take effect if the separation is voluntary. 

Skilling last year cashed in stock options for gains of $62 million, according to Enron filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Lay's gains were nearly double that, at $123 million in 2000, according to the documents. 

Such cash-outs were part of the cause of a volatile exchange between Skilling and Boston-based analyst Richard L. Grubman of Highfields Capital Management during a conference call in April to discuss Enron's first-quarter earnings. 

After Grubman criticized Skilling for not having certain financial information available, Skilling fired back, calling the analyst a vulgar name. 

"He's got some nerve," Grubman said afterward, according to the Toronto Globe & Mail. 

Top Enron executives sold 7 million shares at prices in the $70s and $80s, Grubman said, adding, "Now the stock is in the high $50s, low $60s and I'm an . . . because I ask about the balance sheet?" 

Lay, who was Enron chief executive for 15 years before giving way to Skilling in February, has been scrutinized recently for his close political ties to the Bush administration. 

Lay acknowledged Tuesday that he has met once this year with Vice President Richard Cheney and had two telephone conversations with President Bush's top political aide, Karl Rove. 

However, "most comments about my influence on energy policy or on the administration are grossly exaggerated," Lay said. 

Lay insisted that Skilling's decision should not be seen as a sign of a conflict over Enron's strategy. 

"There is absolutely no change in our business direction or business strategy," Lay said, noting that he and Skilling had been working together to formulate the strategy since the 1980s, when Skilling was still a consultant at McKinsey & Co. 

Analysts said Skilling may have chafed at the length of time it took him to finally be elevated to chief executive. They believe he forced Lay's hand last year by putting out word with analysts that he had been offered another post in London. 

Whatever personal issues may have influenced Skilling's resignation, the job was doubtless a pressure cooker. 

Skilling spent part of last week in England, offering the company's condolences on the death of three workers killed in an explosion at an Enron-owned power plant there. 

The company also has been embroiled in a long dispute with the Indian state of Maharashtra over that government's refusal to buy power from an Enron-backed plant.

California Edison Hangs Hopes on Sacramento Utilities: Execs say debt load can't be eased without legislative help. A deadline passes without action.

Legislative action in the next month probably will determine whether Southern California Edison escapes filing for bankruptcy, executives at the troubled electric utility said Tuesday. 

Edison executives said they were resigned to seeing the original deadline for state lawmakers to craft a rescue plan expire today without action but expected lawmakers to address the issue when they return to Sacramento on Monday. 

Theodore Craver Jr., chief financial officer of Edison International, the utility's corporate parent, said the next few weeks will prove crucial as the Legislature heads for its next recess Sept. 15. 

"We need legislative or regulatory relief to get the revenue to pay" back debt, Craver told creditors in a conference call. 

The Legislature adjourned last month without agreeing on a rescue plan for the Rosemead-based utility, which piled up billions of dollars in losses on power sales when energy prices spiked late last year and earlier this year. 

The state Senate passed a bill last month that would allow SCE to pay off $2.5 billion of its debt through collections from ratepayers but still leave the company with about $1.4 billion in debt and interest charges that it would have to finance on its own. SCE, which has about $1.7 billion in cash, said such a plan would leave it short of the investment-grade credit ratings it needs to refinance debt and conduct business. 

Besides paying off its back debt, Southern California Edison also needs to have the state change the rules of deregulation to allow the utility to routinely recover what it pays for electricity as wholesale prices rise or fall, Craver said. 

Credit-rating and Wall Street analysts agree that without such a legislative change, investors would be reluctant to lend the company money because a sudden rise in the cost of power could tip the utility back into insolvency. 

An Assembly proposal would be more generous, allowing the utility to use ratepayer-financed bonds to cover all but $500 million of its past debt. The bill has passed through several committees but has yet to be voted on by the full Assembly. 

An earlier agreement between the utility and Gov. Gray Davis called for the state to buy SCE's transmission lines for $2.8 billion and issue ratepayer-supported bonds to pay off its remaining debt. Under terms of that agreement, the Legislature was to have passed enabling legislation by today, but the plan failed to gain the support of lawmakers. 

Separately Tuesday, the utility filed documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission warning--as it has for months--that without state action it could be headed into U.S. Bankruptcy Court. 

SCE said it had a total of $3.3 billion in unpaid and overdue debts as of July 31. That includes $1.2 billion to a group of generally small or alternative-power generators known in the industry as qualifying facilities; $878 million to the California Power Exchange, the now-defunct power market in which the utilities and large independent power generators did business; $931 million in defaulted notes and bonds; and $230 million in other debt. 

After factoring in its cash holdings, SCE has a deficit of $1.9 billion, the company said in its filing. 

Consumer advocate Doug Heller said Edison's bankruptcy alarms are intended to pressure the Legislature and Public Utilities Commission into approving a plan to pay off the utility's debts. 

"It's pretty clear that they will use the threat of bankruptcy to get as much money out of ratepayers as they can," said Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer & Consumer Rights, a Santa Monica-based activist group. 

Despite the dire warnings by Edison, its financial situation has improved because of a rate increase of 3 cents a kilowatt-hour that went into effect in June and declining prices for natural gas, a key component in generating electricity . 

Nevertheless, the utility has told the PUC that it fears another rate increase will be needed to cover its own power costs, the projected electricity costs of the California Department of Water Resources and other transition costs. The water agency has been buying electricity for SCE and PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric Co. since mid-January, when the utilities ran so low on cash that generators refused to sell to them. 

SCE, PG&E and Sempra Energy's San Diego Gas & Electric, in filings Tuesday with the PUC, again called for public hearings on the water agency's revenue needs. 

Pacific Gas & Electric said Tuesday that the agency had vastly overestimated the amount of money it needs to pay for the agency's power purchases. The San Francisco-based utility said the state overestimated both the price of power on the spot market and how much natural gas will cost in future years. 

Shares of Edison International rose 8 cents to $14.06 on the New York Stock Exchange.

THE NATION Bush Selects Ex-Texas Regulator to Head FERC

WASHINGTON -- President Bush on Tuesday named Patrick H. Wood III, a former Texas utility regulator with a pragmatic, hands-on style, to be the next chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 

Akin to a national utilities commission, FERC has the power to set wholesale electricity rates, making it a key player in California 's efforts to recover from the energy crisis. But the commission initially took a hands-off approach, drawing bitter criticism from state officials. 

In June, FERC finally imposed price limits throughout the West, while also ordering generators to sell any available power when needed. Wood--then a new commissioner--helped create the consensus for that decision, which has been cited for helping to ensure an unexpectedly calm summer. 

Wood is an advocate of electricity deregulation who nonetheless believes that markets must be closely policed and government should intervene if consumers aren't benefiting. 

"Pat Wood is someone who accepts the proposition that markets have to be constructed," said Mark Cooper, a regulatory expert at the Consumer Federation of America and frequent FERC critic. "He understands that markets are not born as mature adults--they can go very wrong and when that happens, they have to be disciplined." 

Wood said Tuesday that his main goal will be to help deregulated electricity markets take root in all 50 states. About half the states have taken steps toward deregulation, but many are holding back in view of California 's problems. Wood said he would also ask Congress for authority to set up regional market monitoring offices around the country. 

"My top one priority is to get competitive energy markets in this country," Wood said. "That is what I am about. That is what I was picked for. To do that, we need to be credible, adept and open-minded. . . . People may not care about who we are, but they do care about what happens as a result of what we do." 

Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), a leader on energy issues in the state's congressional delegation, welcomed Wood's appointment. "As a sensible problem-solver, Pat Wood places practicality over ideology," Feinstein said in a statement. Wood "will hopefully give some needed teeth to an agency that for far too long has delayed in coming to the aid of California ." 

Since being confirmed as a commission member by the Senate in late May, Wood, 39, has taken an increasingly active role at the agency. A longtime political ally of the president, Wood was immediately chosen by Bush to be his special intermediary to California Gov. Gray Davis. 

Wood also made common cause with FERC Commissioner William L. Massey, a Democrat who for months had been the lonely advocate of a more activist role. Wood's arrival shifted the balance of power on the five-member commission toward those who favored intervention to head off further problems in the West. 

When FERC Chairman Curtis L. Hebert Jr. announced last week that he would resign at the end of the month, it cleared the way for Wood's long-expected promotion. Separately, Entergy, a New Orleans-based energy conglomerate, announced Tuesday that Hebert will join its ranks as a senior lobbyist. 

Industry officials also said they were pleased with Wood's appointment, which will take effect Sept. 1 and does not require further Senate action. 

As chairman, Wood will set FERC's agenda and oversee a staff of 1,200 with a budget of $175 million. But his honeymoon may be short-lived, as he faces resistance on several policy fronts. 

For example, with regard to California , FERC is unlikely to order anything like the $9 billion that Gov. Davis is demanding in refunds from power producers. 

And the agency is on a collision course with the governor over the independence of the nonprofit entity that operates the state's electric grid. Under a new California law, Davis appoints the governing board of the California Independent System Operator. But FERC policy requires the board to be insulated from political control. 

"Stay tuned," Wood said. "That's not anything I'm willing to discuss at this point."

President Bush yesterday named fellow Texan Pat Wood III to be chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, putting an unconventional ally at the head of the federal agency that oversees the restructuring of the nation's electricity industry. 

Wood, the former chief energy regulator in Texas, was appointed a FERC commissioner by Bush and joined the agency in June. But his appointment as chairman had to await the resignation of Chairman Curt L. Hebert Jr., which takes effect at the end of this month. 

A strong advocate of energy deregulation, Wood has surprised some industry officials and analysts by pushing for around-the-clock electricity -price restraints in California and other western states, and supporting California 's bid for refunds from power suppliers. 

Yesterday, Wood said he wouldn't discuss his plans for FERC until after he talks with its other commissioners. "I want us to do the agenda as a team as opposed to a Pat Wood show." 

But he said there is a clear need to strengthen FERC's oversight and investigative staff to see that the deregulation of electricity produces competition, not monopoly profits. "People say, 'He's not for free markets.' Yes, I am. But we have to get there first. 

"At the beginning of a market it's like a teenager. The parents let you out with the car, but they stay up all night until the kids get home. And one day it all works."

New Energy-Panel
Chief Praised for
`Vision' of Deregulation
By Richard B. Schmitt

WASHINGTON -- When President Bush named fellow Texan Pat Wood III to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission last spring, it was a popular choice back home. Some of the state's utilities were happy to see him go. 

After all, Mr. Wood, as chairman of the Texas public-utility commission, had helped implement a deregulation scheme that wasn't always friendly to the interests of the state's biggest electric companies. Upstart power generators were given a boost to start competing with their entrenched rivals. Even consumer groups considered him reasonable. 

"Pat was the smartest chairman we have ever had," says Tom Smith, director of the Texas office of Public Citizen, a nonpartisan consumer-advocacy group. "He had a good vision of how to make deregulated markets work." 

Now, Mr. Wood is having a chance to extend that vision. Yesterday, President Bush elevated him to be chairman of the FERC, effective Sept. 1, to succeed Mississippi Republican Curt Hebert, who resigned last week to take a job in private industry. While both men are staunch believers in free markets, Mr. Wood is considered more likely to suggest interventionist measures when those markets break down. 

The Wood approach may surprise those who think Bush administration appointees are either unfailingly friendly to the energy industry, or reflexively opposed to market intervention. Already, the FERC, which was criticized earlier this year for taking a hands-off approach to California 's recent power problems, seems more energized. Since Mr. Wood, 39 years old, was first appointed to the commission three months ago, the agency has set price caps on wholesale electricity sales in California , and ordered a hearing that may result in a billion or so dollars in refunds to the state from Texas energy companies. 

At the same time, Mr. Wood has helped chart an aggressive course to restructure the nation's power lines into a sort of interstate highway system for electricity , which he says will foster more competition and consumer choice. 

"I never thought I would be so happy to see two new Republicans," William Massey, a Clinton appointee to the FERC, says of Mr. Wood and Nora Brownell, another Bush appointee. "I have been very heartened. They believe in promoting markets. But they will absolutely insist that markets provide consumer benefits." 

Still, some utilities are already chafing at the newly resurgent FERC. Financial analysts attribute a recent decline in utility stocks in part to concerns that FERC under Mr. Wood will adopt tough new rules of the road such as limits on their ability to do power deals with affiliate companies. 

Some also see politics at work: His view of the deregulated world largely coincides with that of Enron Corp., the giant Houston energy company, whose chairman, Kenneth Lay, was one of the largest single contributors to the Bush presidential campaign. Both think the country should have a seamless web of power lines that any energy company can tap into freely. Lately, some utility lawyers in Washington have taken to calling the FERC under Mr. Wood the "Federal Enron Regulatory Commission." 

Mr. Wood says in an interview, "I am always glad to have allies where I can," but dismisses the idea that Enron has any unusual influence with him. 

And conversely, some think that because he is so close to Mr. Bush, Mr. Wood actually will have the power to do what he wants without outside interference. 

Certainly, Mr. Wood is deeply rooted in Texas energy circles. He was born in the refinery town of Port Arthur and worked as an engineer on an offshore oil rig after college. When oil prices sagged in the 1980s, he ditched the job to get a law degree at Harvard, followed by a stint at the Houston law firm Baker Botts. Later, he worked as a legal adviser at FERC and the Texas Railroad Commission. He was appointed to the Texas public-utility commission in 1995. 

Mr. Wood says the real influence in his life and work comes less from oil than pharmaceuticals: His father has operated an independent pharmacy in Port Arthur for years. In the 1980s, when the big chain stores invaded his territory, the elder Mr. Wood was faced with being driven out of business. He kept afloat by computerizing his operations and by hooking up with other independents to increase their buying power. 

In Texas, the son helped prod what he calls "some of the biggest `just-say-no' utilities in the country" into supporting a bill that will open up the state to retail electric competition starting next year. 

Initially, the industry balked at giving up its monopoly status. Mr. Wood responded by scrutinizing standard rate increases and questioning their costs. 

Over the years, Mr. Wood had run-ins over everything from the pricing of transmission service to new entrants -- which utilities thought didn't fairly reflect their own expenses -- and legislation requiring the utilities to offer customer rebates sooner than the deregulation law required. 

At FERC, he is trying to replicate the experience on a larger scale. He envisions once-localized transmission grids combined into giant regional networks that in theory provide seamless "open access" to competing generators. 

He wants the cost of hooking up new power plants to the grids to be borne throughout the system; that is a reversal of current FERC policy, which requires generators to foot those bills on their own.

THE NATION Energy Issue Tops Agenda of Governors Politics: Chief executives of Western states meet in Idaho. Conspicuous by his absence is California's Gray Davis.

COEUR d'ALENE, Idaho -- A conference of the Western Governors Assn. called to discuss wildfires and energy devolved Monday into another denunciation of Gov. Gray Davis of California, whose repeated failure to attend these sessions was said to be impeding solutions to the region's problems. 

In his 2 1/2 years in office, Davis has attended only one of at least six full-fledged meetings of the WGA, an association of chief executives from 18 Western states that tries to present a common voice to Washington on the region's needs.


California-bashing is nothing new in the Republican-dominated group, especially with a Democrat in Sacramento. But as the energy crisis has focused so heavily on California, governors are increasingly frustrated that Davis is a constant no-show. His sole appearance was at the group's "energy summit" in February. 

Idaho Gov. Dirk Kempthorne went so far as to say that Davis' absence at the meetings has hampered the group's effort to resolve the West's energy problems. 

"Gov. Davis should be here," Kempthorne said at the end of Monday's energy session, which dealt with ways to transmit power from the West's energy-rich, sparsely populated states to energy-hungry California. "No one state can be an island. We need to work together." 

Davis was not the only Western governor who failed to attend this meeting--five others didn't attend either. Davis' predecessor, Pete Wilson, also made a habit of missing the several WGA sessions each year. 

A spokeswoman for Davis said a "personal scheduling conflict" prevented Davis' attendance. California was represented at the conference by Deborah Slon, a legislative affairs liaison. 

"I don't think you should interpret that as a lack of attention and lack of interest," said Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean. "He has a great deal of respect for his fellow governors. We certainly count on and appreciate our neighbors in the West. " 

But some governors here are baffled that Davis can't find time to meet with them at a time when so many issues so crucial to California are on the table. 

"These are issues concerning his state," said Arizona Gov. Jane Dee Hull. "It would be better for him to make his points face to face, rather than through aides. It's hard to make your case if you are not here." 

Wyoming Gov. Jim Geringer threatened to send the region's power to the East rather than California. He coined the phrase, "OTC--Other Than California" to suggest a strategy to sell surplus power elsewhere. 

"For the governor of California not to be here to participate removes California from the opportunity to have a partnership that's beneficial to all," Geringer said. "He really should look at his priorities. What I think Gov. Davis should do is look beyond political opportunity and look to the long-term viability of the state." 

Davis missed a spirited discussion among federal and state officials of one of the central puzzles in the energy debate: how to move the region's abundant and diverse energy resources to where they are needed most. The transmission of energy to where it is needed is a challenge in such states as Wyoming and Montana, where coal mines are remote and unconnected to power transmission lines. 

"We've got the resources," Geringer said. "We are just having a heck of a time getting those resources where they are needed." 

The construction of power transmission lines is a private-sector issue and the governors discussed how to encourage the multibillion-dollar investment required to string a line of massive transmission towers across some of the nation's most rugged terrain. 

The governors heard from utility company executives who bemoaned the federal bureaucracy that makes building transmission towers a multiyear effort. 

The aesthetic issue of states not wanting the unattractive towers dominating their landscapes was also discussed. That brought up, again, California. Jack Davis, an executive with Arizona's largest utility company, reluctantly invoked the Golden State to illustrate the problem. 

"I'll use the most convenient whipping boy," he said. "States argue, 'We put these [towers] in my backyard so it will heat their spas in California.' That's what we're facing."

(08-15) 07:37 PDT (AP) -- 

Developments in California's energy crisis: 


WEDNESDAY:


* No power alerts Wednesday as electricity reserves remain above seven percent. 


TUESDAY:


* No power alerts Tuesday as electricity reserves remain above seven percent. 


MONDAY:


* Gov. Gray Davis names four board members of the state's first public power authority, tapping S. David Freeman, his chief energy adviser and an ardent supporter of public power, as chairman of the California Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority. 

Two of Davis' four appointees to the board also are board members of a nonprofit foundation funded by utilities and energy companies, prompting an immediate outcry from consumer advocates who say those members are too close to the energy industry. The other appointees are Sunne W. McPeak, Donald Vial and John R. Stevens, former staff director for the governor. The fifth member of the board, by statute, is State Treasurer Phil Angelides. 

The power authority, approved by the Legislature this spring, will be able to issue up to $5 billion in bonds to buy, lease or build power plants. 

* The city and county of San Francisco takes the first step to end its contract to sell low-cost power to the Turlock Irrigation District, saying it needs to stem financial losses in the escalating energy market. The city files a notice of termination with the district, to which it has sold electricity since 1987. San Francisco sells power generated by the Hetch Hetchy reservoir to irrigation districts in Turlock and Modesto at a fixed rate. The contracts were to expire in 2015. However, they require the city to supply the power even when Hetch Hetchy is not operating, forcing it to buy expensive power on the open market. Turlock has not yet formally responded and discussions with Modesto are under way. 

* Shares of PG&E Corp. rise 2 cents to close at $16.05. Shares of Edison International fall 3 cents to close at $13.98. Shares of Sempra Energy, parent company of San Diego Gas and Electric Co., rise 9 cents to close at $26.71. 

* No power alerts Monday as electricity reserves stay above 7 percent. 


WHAT'S NEXT:


* The deadline for the Legislature to approve Davis' rescue deal for Southern California Edison is Aug. 15. 

* Critics of the Department of Water Resources' revenue requirements have until Tuesday to file comments with the PUC. 

* PUC Commissioner Carl Wood hears arguments on an agreement between San Diego Gas & Electric and Gov. Gray Davis on Thursday at San Diego City Council Chambers. 


THE PROBLEM:


High demand, high wholesale energy costs, transmission glitches and a tight supply worsened by scarce hydroelectric power in the Northwest and maintenance at aging California power plants are all factors in California's electricity crisis. 

Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric say they've lost nearly $14 billion since June 2000 to high wholesale prices the state's electricity deregulation law bars them from passing on to consumers. PG&E, saying it hasn't received the help it needs from regulators or state lawmakers, filed for federal bankruptcy protection April 6. Electricity and natural gas suppliers, scared off by the companies' poor credit ratings, are refusing to sell to them, leading the state in January to start buying power for the utilities' nearly 9 million residential and business customers. The state is also buying power for a third investor-owned utility, San Diego Gas & Electric, which is in better financial shape than much larger Edison and PG&E but is also struggling with high wholesale +power+ costs. 

The Public Utilities Commission has approved average rate increases of 37 percent for the heaviest residential customers and 38 percent for commercial customers, and hikes of up to 49 percent for industrial customers and 15 percent or 20 percent for agricultural customers to help finance the state's multibillion-dollar power buys. 


 
 
 
 
 
 
EPA delays decision on air pollution rule

Washington -- The Bush administration postponed yesterday its decision on how to overhaul a key anti-pollution program as top officials struggled to devise a new strategy that could ease the regulatory burden on the energy industry without being viewed as an environmental rollback. 

The Environmental Protection Agency announced that it would not issue a reassessment of an air pollution rule by Friday, as President Bush ordered it to do this spring. The agency said the review would be delayed until September, 

when the administration will propose a comprehensive strategy to control pollution in a more flexible and less intrusive way. 

The delay shows how jittery the administration has become as it seeks to carry out some elements of Bush's national energy strategy. The president announced the plan with fanfare in May, but his administration has come under steady fire from Democrats and national environmental groups who accuse it of tilting too much in favor of industry supporters at the expense of clean air and water. 

At issue is the so-called new source review, which requires the installation of the latest pollution control equipment whenever new power plants, refineries and industrial facilities are built or substantially upgraded. Established by the Clean Air Act of 1970, it is aimed at curtailing smokestack emissions from some 22,000 facilities nationwide, including primary sources of pollutants like nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide and mercury. 

Jeffrey Holmstead, the EPA's assistant administrator for air and radiation, said the review was delayed because the administration wanted to present a broad pollution-control strategy as a whole, rather than announcing policies in pieces and potentially giving critics more opportunities to attack. 

"It has quickly become apparent that environmental groups will portray any changes in this program as changes that will kill people," Holmstead said. "We want to lay out our vision for a multipollutants strategy and show that we will achieve better environmental protection at lower cost." 

Several other EPA officials said that another reason for the delay was that EPA and Department of Energy officials did not agree on whether new source review substantially inhibited energy production -- and did not agree on how much it needed to be changed. 

Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham has favored a thorough overhaul that would greatly reduce the program's burden on utilities and oil companies and potentially end some existing enforcement actions, these officials said. EPA Administrator Christie Whitman proposed more modest revisions -- many of which were originally considered by the Clinton administration -- that would make the program more flexible but preserve existing lawsuits and enforcement actions under the rule, they said. 

Whitman has said that she hopes to phase out new source review and some other enforcement programs as they apply to utilities by consolidating them in a broad strategy. 

The strategy would set tighter limits on national emissions of major pollutants, but allow utilities to trade credits among themselves -- in effect, 

letting the market dictate how the limits are met. The system is more flexible, proponents say, and would require less plant-by-plant enforcement.

EPA puts off decision on modernization rules for power plants

(08-15) 03:44 PDT WASHINGTON (AP) -- 

The Bush administration has put off announcing whether it will stop tightening pollution requirements for power plants that are being repaired or upgraded. Environmentalists worry that the delay is a signal that industry will win changes in the rules. 

The Environmental Protection Agency postponed the decision until September, when it will propose legislation for reducing emissions of three major air pollutants. 

"Our top priority is protecting public health and the environment, and we are in the final stages of developing a comprehensive strategy that will allow us to take the next step forward into a new generation of air pollution controls," EPA Administrator Christie Whitman said Tuesday. 

At issue is the EPA's "new source review" program, which is supposed to minimize air pollution from new factories, power plants and refineries. 

Power industry officials say EPA has applied the regulations to routine maintenance and replacement work, making plant maintenance schedules longer and more costly. Environmentalists want the program left intact. 

The postponement "sends a clear signal that EPA is headed in the wrong direction," said Rebecca Stanfield, an attorney for the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. "They're looking to obscure the impact of what they're doing by putting into the context of a bigger legislative proposal." 

In a statement, the EPA noted that the National Governors' Association last week called for reform of the program "to achieve improvements that enhance the environment and increase energy production capacity." 

The EPA's evaluation of the program was ordered by a task force, headed by Vice President Dick Cheney, that predicted the need for 1,300 new power plants. The agency held four hearings around the country and received 130,000 written comments on the issue, and was to report to President Bush by Friday. 

The Justice Department is separately reviewing enforcement actions that have been brought under the program to see if they were legal under the Clean Air Act. 

The legislation that the EPA is expected to propose next month will set caps on emissions of nitrogen, sulfur and mercury while allowing the industry to find the most cost-effective means of compliance, the agency said. 

The administration has refused to include carbon dioxide among those pollutants, despite its link to global warming. 

"We are developing a comprehensive approach to improving our efforts to control air pollution, to achieve significant reductions in air pollution while simultaneously streamlining the regulatory process so it works better, achieving real reductions and full industry compliance at far less cost," Whitman said. 


 

 

 

Energy firms taking state grants 

Utilities: Sempra and Calpine receive up to $1 million in subsidies for employee training meant to keep jobs in the state. 

August 15, 2001 

By HANH KIM QUACH
The Orange County Register 

Two energy companies that have made hefty profits off California's energy crisis are also cashing in on the state's business-financed employee- training subsidies used to groom employees and keep jobs in California. 

San Jose-based Calpine Corp., which has cornered a large chunk of the long-term energy contracts with the state, in December was granted $1 million to train 100 employees to work at their new in-state power plants. The money is expected to be reimbursed to the company over two years. 

Sempra Energy, parent company of San Diego Gas & Electric, expects to receive $409,000 to train about 500 workers on a new $6.5 million computer system and improve their business and communication skills. 

The companies say they're contributing to California's economy by giving their employees more valuable skills and are breaking no laws by tapping these funds. 

In fact, they're no different from the Wal-Marts and Oakleys that have also drawn from this state training account and their gains have been in some cases similar if not more. 

"We are working with the system,'' said Bill Highlander, Calpine spokesman. 

But energy companies strike an emotional chord for lawmakers and consumer advocates, who questioned whether it's appropriate for energy companies in particular - whose profit margins have soared during the energy crisis - should be getting this money at the expense of other businesses. 

"It's really appalling because those companies have made so much money in California. The last thing they need is a state-subsidized training problem. We certainly don't need to teach them how to make any more money,'' said Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Rey. 

Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, agreed. 

"This seems to be companies flush with cash trying to get more cash. That's disturbing that there are many businesses operating on a very thin margin that could benefit very well for the employees,'' he said. 

The money comes from the California Employment Training Panel, established in 1983 at the height of a recession and massive layoffs. All for-profit businesses pay a special tax, at the rate of about $7-per-employee per year, amassing about $80 million annually. 

Initially, the panel was formed to help the unemployed get job training and retrain workers with jobs, but whose skills were becoming outdated as technology changed. 

In 1994, state law was narrowed to allow only businesses with out-of-state competition to retrain their employees, although money is available for companies wishing to retrain highly skilled workers in specific jobs, or businesses in high-unemployment areas. 

Other large companies that have tapped Employment Training Panel money include: Wal-Mart Stores Inc. with $1.2 million in Porterville to train 850 workers in vocational English as a Second Language, computer and manufacturing skills; Disneyland with $1.3 million to train 600 employees in commercial and management skills; and Frito-Lay Inc. with $124,410 to train 122 workers in management, business and computer skills. 

In fact, about 41 percent of the $49.7 million disbursed for training last year went to the largest companies with more than 500 employees. At times, such disbursements raised eyebrows within and outside the panel, but "there is no 'means test''' to assess "does this big business really need this money,'' said Peter Demauro, the panel's general counsel. 

Both energy companies say the money is needed. 

"It's not a matter of Sempra Energy's net income. It's really about companies keeping their employees in tiptop skill shape,'' said Sempra spokeswoman Laura Farmer. 

Sempra's "cash conservation'' efforts left its information technology department with about half of what it had been spending for computer training. Without the state's money, training would go at a slower place, said Mirin Wu, the company's director of software development. 

And if information technology employees didn't have the skills, then Sempra's subsidiary companies might turn to out-of-state computer firms for their needs, she said. 

Critics say both Sempra and Calpine can afford training. 

Sempra Energy's profits climbed 8.8 percent over the last year, while Calpine's profits more than tripled, by 240 percent, last year. Some of the non-energy companies did better than that, some worse. Wal-Mart gained 17 percent this past year and Walt Disney Co. lost 30 percent. 

Sempra and Calpine have also made a hefty sum from the state. From January through May 31, Sempra sold $429 million in power to California. Meanwhile, Calpine walked away with $29 million. And the two have invested a combined $812,000 to influence the Legislature this year, documents show. 

"It seems pretty inappropriate for the generators who have been making windfall profits at California's expense to be using (the state's) money to subsidize the training of their workers. Their profits are high enough to invest in their workers,'' said Nettie Hoge, executive director of the consumer group The Utility Reform Network. "And not to be anti-generator, (but) it means that these resources aren't available for those working in other sectors of the economy who actually have been harmed by high energy costs.'' 

Register staff writer James Kelleher contributed to this report.

PG&E filed their Schedule F which displays its nonpriority unsecured claims.  
Many of the claims were listed as unknown in amount.  The PX credit amounts 
were listed as disputed.   Two PX credit amounts were specified in the 
Schedule F:

Enron Energy Marketing      $201,964,905.64
Enron Energy Services       $ 19,737,979.97
Total disclosed PX credit   $221,702,885.61

Note that in the claims that were listed as unknown in amount, none were 
described as PX Credit in nature. 

Two points to be made: 1) this information is now public (but on page 5,066 
of 17,096 on a CD), along with $53,985,167 in other Enron related claims, and 
2) our calculation of the PX credit was $392,416,534 at the beginning of May.

Regards,


Michael

Presented below is a synopsis of the 6.75 hour phone call yesterday.   The 
primary short-term issue facing us is whether we wish to throw our name in to 
be co-chair.    The only other marketer on the official committee is Dynegy, 
Reliant is not on the committee but sat in.    The group generally agreed 
that the co-chairs should be a financial player (bank, bond or CP) and an 
energy company (QF or marketer).   After the phone call, I spoke with 
Dynegy's general counsel John Herbert, who is their designated 
representative.  He was going to check within his organization whether there 
was appetite to serve today, but was not all that inclined, given his "day 
job" as he put it.   I think we would agree that a marketer should be the 
other co-chair as the QF's have a narrow agenda.  Here are some of the 
plusses and minuses if we threw our name in:

+ Better access to information and guiding consensus
+ Ability to explain the necessity of long term contracts in the solution
- time commitment
- will we be more of a lightning rod?


Regards,


Michael

Michael:  I could not tell if you were copied on this, but I thought Ben's 
quick e-mail note to me gave a good description of the situation and the 
initial issues we need to focus on, particularly as regards the possible 
advisors for the committee.  Based on your economic analyses of the various 
parties exposures to date, do you think the numbers that some of the 
participants at the meeting threw out seemed to be in the ballpark?  Do you 
get the sense the numbers are "gross" or "net" (i.e., after reflecting any 
offsets, such as any out of the money power contracts entered into at the 
same time EPMI did its deal last October)?  I'll be out of town tomorrow, but 
I'll touch base with you at some point.  John

John, Carl and Jim,

I attended the PGE Committee call today.  During the call, it became apparent 
that a group of creditors were meeting in a law firm's office nearby.  I 
therefore walked over and attended the meeting in person.  I learned that 
Reliant, Dynegy and Meriant had been in the process of forming an ad hoc 
committee which they had invited Merrill Lynch, B of A and some of the QF's 
to join.  That unofficial committee had not gotten off the ground when the BK 
hit.

All of the official committee members were present either by phone or in 
person.  Many had counsel present.  In addition, representatives of Reliant, 
Meriant (sp?), the Ohio State Teachers Ass'n and a QF called Crockett were 
permitted to attend.  Finally, representatives of PricewaterhouseCoopers, 
which is acting as financial advisors to the Banks, and of Saybrook Capital, 
which is acting as advisors to the State of TN, were present.

The US Trustee made a short presentation regarding duties of committees.  
After they got off the line, the creditors each explained their claim as 
follows:

Ohio State Teachers:  $56M of commercial paper (CP)
B of A: $938M syndicated loan and a letter of credit supporting pollution 
control bonds
Reliant: generator owed $358M
Dynegy: generator owed $255M
Crockett: QF owed $55M
GWF Power: non-gas fired QF owed $60M
Merrill Lynch: holder of CP and unsecured bonds, but declined to state amount 
at this time
Meriant: generator owed $220M
BONY: indenture trustee owed $2 bn
State of Tennessee: CP holder, owed $76M
Davey Tree: trade vendor (tree trimming) owed $10M
US Bank: indenture trustee on 3 bond issues totalling $310M
Palo Alto: party to contracts relating to WAPA and NCPA.  owed $50M, but 
claimed to represent municipalities that could be owed as much as $2 bn if 
the WAPA contracts are rejected.

The committee first discussed the SoCal Edison MOU with the governor.  The 
proposal does not help the QF's, as the rates to be paid to them going 
forward do not cover their fuel costs, and doesn't resolve the generator 
issues either.  There also is a major feasibility issue in terms of the 
ability of the capital markets to absorb $20 bn plus of bonds.

PGE's lawyers then came in and made a brief presentation.  They said:
- PGE won't pay out more than it takes in in rates.  They believe there is 
enough money in their rates to pay the QF's at rate set in Woods decision 
going forward; they racknowledge that the QF's have been the most hurt.
- they believe their liability for the net short position was cutoff at least 
as of April 6 as a result of a FERC decision and a decision of the 9th 
Circuit, and may have been cutoff as of 1/17.
- they will continue to pay the DWR 6.4 cents on an interim basis with a 
reservation of rights.  Will not pay more than they collect.  They expect 
this to become an issue when the amount they have to pay the DWR goes up to 
9.4 cents.
- they view the PUC as their adversary and want to use the BKY Ct as the 
forum for financial issues.  They want creditors' support against the PUC.
- they have hired E & Y as their financial advisors and Ken Buckfire of 
Wasserstein as their investment banker.
- they recommended that the Committee retain a PR firm.

After PGE's counsel departed, the Committee turned to organizational issues.

Clara Yang Strand of B of A offered to serve as Co-chair.  The Committee 
discussed having one of the generators serve as the other co-chair.  Enron is 
thinking about it, as is Dynegy.  During breaks, both Palo Alto and GWF Power 
(a QF) told me they would support Enron to be co-chair.

The Committee then discussed counsel retention.  A number of firms were 
discussed.  Enron suggested Milbank; other members, particularly the QF's, 
objected because of Milbank's prior representation of the PX.  Eventually a 
short list was arrived at of Sheppard Mullin; Paul Hastings; Sidley & Austin; 
O'Melveny; Skadden.  These firms will be invited to make a short presentation 
on Monday.

The issue on counsel is that Sidley has been involved for quite some time as 
B of A's counsel.  They seem like the frontrunner for that reason.  The issue 
for Enron is whether it is comfortable with the Bank as Chair and the Bank's 
counsel as committee counsel.  This is perhaps less of an issue if Enron is 
co-chair.

Next, retention of a financial advisor was discussed.  B of A tried to 
steamroll PWC through.  I objected, as did BONY, that we needed more time, so 
the matter was deferred to Monday.  Right now the only candidate for the 
position is PWC; do we have any other recommendations?  My understanding is 
that the remaining big accounting firms are all engaged by CA utilities.

I am a little concerned that the process is heading in the direction of the 
Bank as Chair, the Bank's lawyer as committee counsel and the Bank's 
financial advisor as the committee's advisor.

We then discussed retaining an investment banker.  The leading candidate is 
Saybrook Capital.  This was tabled in the short term, although Saybrook was 
asked to send a pitch book to the committee.

Finally, we discussed hiring a PR firm and a lobbyist.  The general sense was 
that both were a good idea, and names will be solicited.

The Committee will meet in person in Monday in SF starting at 11.  PGE was 
asked to visit at 2 that day.  Carl and I plan to attend on Monday along with 
Michael.

Call me with questions.

Ben Young

Laws aim at saving energy
By Emily Bazar
BEE CAPITOL BUREAU
(Published April 12, 2001)=20
Gov. Gray Davis insists that Californians who own aging appliances or shive=
r=20
in drafty homes aren't the only ones who will benefit from two major=20
energy-conservation bills he signed into law Wednesday.=20
Instead, the Democratic governor -- who is wrestling with the state's energ=
y=20
crisis as summertime blackouts loom -- has billed the measures as an=20
opportunity for all Californians to save precious megawatts in the critical=
=20
coming months.=20
"Clearly, the cheapest megawatt this summer is the megawatt we don't have t=
o=20
buy," said Davis, who vetoed more than $250 million from the bills, leaving=
=20
about $860 million for energy-saving programs.=20
The governor has said many times that conservation is a key element of his=
=20
overall plan to solve the energy crisis, and that these bills -- SB 5x by=
=20
state Sen. Byron Sher, D-Palo Alto, and AB 29x by Assemblywoman Christine=
=20
Kehoe, D-San Diego -- embody that commitment.=20
Crafted to complement each other, the measures include money for a wide ran=
ge=20
of programs, most of which exist. For instance, the bills dedicate millions=
=20
of dollars to low-income families who need help paying their electricity=20
bills and to families who hope to install solar panels on their roofs.=20
Taken together, the conservation programs are expected to save roughly 2,00=
0=20
megawatts this summer, enough energy to power about 2 million homes, Davis=
=20
said.=20
In deciding what to veto, Davis said he shaved or eliminated provisions tha=
t=20
would not yield energy savings by summertime.=20
"Everything we're doing in SB 5x and AB 29x is targeted toward reducing=20
electricity demand during hot summer afternoons to help avoid rolling=20
blackouts," said Claudia Chandler, a spokeswoman for the California Energy=
=20
Commission.=20
Among their many provisions, the bills include $90 million in rebates or=20
other incentives to encourage Californians to replace inefficient washing=
=20
machines, air conditioners and other appliances with newer energy-saving=20
models.=20
Currently, rebates for energy-efficient refrigerators average about $75, pl=
us=20
the cost of removing the old refrigerator.=20
The incentives will be available to customers of investor-owned utilities,=
=20
such as Pacific Gas and Electric Co., and municipal utilities, such as the=
=20
Sacramento Municipal Utility District.=20
SMUD expects its share will be between $6 million and $9 million, said Mike=
=20
Weedall, manager of energy services.=20
Some of the $90 million also will go toward helping low-income residents=20
weatherize their homes and pay their utility bills.=20
In all, the measures provide $240 million in low-income assistance,=20
encouraging people to install double-paned windows and insulation where the=
y=20
live to save power and reduce their energy bills.=20
Senate leader John Burton, D-San Francisco, said the bills include assistan=
ce=20
for California's families who can least afford the average 29 percent rate=
=20
hike recently approved by the California Public Utilities Commission for PG=
&E=20
and Southern California Edison customers.=20
"They're the ones that will end up freezing to death when they can't pay=20
their bills," Burton said. "We're doing all this (other) stuff; we ought to=

The bills also include $60 million in rebates and incentives to help=20
consumers and businesses reduce their lighting and $105 million to encourag=
e=20
renewable and other Earth-friendly power generation projects, such as rooft=
op=20
solar panels.=20
In order to entice Californians to participate in these programs, the=20
measures provide $10 million for a public-awareness campaign.=20
The measures' journeys through the Legislature, however, were fraught with=
=20
roadblocks. The Assembly, for instance, last week added several proposals=
=20
favorable to farmers.=20
One of their proposals would have limited the amount of time interruptible=
=20
agricultural customers could lose energy to four hours a day or 20 hours a=
=20
month. "Interruptible" customers volunteer to lose power in emergencies in=

exchange for lower rates.=20
But the changes riled Senate leaders. Eventually, the dispute was resolved =

among all customers, not just agricultural ones.=20
Sandra Spelliscy, general counsel for the Planning and Conservation League,=

Enron ordered to provide power to state's colleges

their electricity.=20
U.S. District Judge Phyllis J. Hamilton issued a preliminary injunction=20
holding Texas-based Enron Energy Systems Inc. to the final year of a=20
four-year contract to sell energy directly to the University of California=

and California State University. Unless a higher court rules otherwise, her=

order will remain effective until the results of a full-scale trial.=20
The two university systems signed the contract to get relief from the risk =

relying on shaky utilities, Hamilton said. She said the company took away=

that security when it switched 29 of the state's 33 campuses to Pacific Gas=

She noted PG&E's precarious position since filing for bankruptcy last week.=
=20
In applying for the injunction, lawyers representing the universities argue=

that Enron was motivated by a desire to sell as much of its electricity as=

universities' contract with Enron, signed in 1998, sets their rate at 5=20
percent less than the rate being charged by the utilities.=20
Appearing before Hamilton in support of the schools, state Attorney General=
=20
Bill Lockyer argued that Enron, in effect, was saying, "We don't want to se=

power at the price we promised."=20
But Enron's lawyer, A. William Urquhart, said the company had a duty to its=

shareholders to act in their economic interest.=20
He said he would take the ruling to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals=
=20
immediately. He asked Hamilton to stay it until the circuit court can act,=
=20
but she refused.=20
In papers filed with the court, Urquhart said Enron switched many customers=
=20
to the utilities as the "most logical way to mitigate the impact" of losses=
=20
the company incurred after it stopped getting paid by the California=20
utilities almost a year ago.=20
Enron will pay the difference between the rate it promised the universities=

and the rates charged them by the utilities, he said.=20
But the universities said they were losing other contracted benefits,=20
including protection from the threat of blackouts and a sophisticated Enron=
=20
metering and billing system that's an essential part of a conservation=20
program.=20
After the hearing, Lockyer called the ruling an important victory over a=20
company that he said has best exemplified the "gouging" and "piracy" of=20
California consumers during the energy crisis.=20
He said an investigation by his office that could lead to civil or criminal=

PG&E shorts counties $4.2 million: Poorer local governments say it'll be=20
tough to get by with half a tax ration.
By Jennifer K. Morita
BEE STAFF WRITER=20
(Published April 12, 2001)

After filing for bankruptcy protection last week, Pacific Gas and Electric=
=20
Co. notified local county governments that it won't be able to pay $4.2=20
million it owes them in property taxes.=20
That left officials from El Dorado, Nevada, Placer, Plumas, Sacramento,=20
Sutter, Yolo and Yuba counties with mixed feelings. Some said reserve funds=
=20
will cover the losses, at least for now. But officials of other, smaller=20
counties that rely on PG&E tax money to pay for public services, employees'=
=20
salaries and various programs, are nervously crossing their fingers as they=
=20
watch the utility's bankruptcy proceedings.=20
PG&E owes California counties $79 million for the Jan. 1-June 30 property t=
ax=20
installment that was due Tuesday. It paid slightly less than half of what i=
t=20
owes.=20
PG&E officials said the company was limited in what it could pay because of=
=20
the bankruptcy filing, and paid only what was due for April 6-June 30.=20
"Under the bankruptcy law we can pay our obligation going forward as part o=
f=20
normal business operation," PG&E spokesman Ron Low said Wednesday. "We woul=
d=20
need the court's approval to pay any pre-petition, or pre-filing obligation=
."=20
Low added, however, that the utility intends to ask the court to let it pay=
=20
the balance. "We fully intend to pay the entire amount owed in property=20
taxes," Low said.=20
Two of the hardest-hit counties are Yuba and Plumas.=20
Yuba County, one of the poorest in the state, depends heavily on PG&E tax=
=20
dollars, said County Treasurer-Tax Collector Jim Kennedy.=20
"PG&E is the largest single taxpayer in the county, and the percentage it=
=20
represents of our total tax revenues is the largest share for any county in=
=20
the state," Kennedy said.=20
Although PG&E failed to pay its semiannual installment of $794,292, Kennedy=
=20
remained optimistic that a check was in the mail. Still, the county will be=
=20
receiving $417,003 less than it is owed.=20
In Plumas County, where PG&E is the largest private property owner, officia=
ls=20
are reeling from the tax loss.=20
The utility company paid $762,519 on Tuesday, less than half the $1.6 milli=
on=20
it owed.=20
Plumas County government's share of the shortfall is around $250,000, said=
=20
treasurer Barbara J. Coates. The rest goes to schools, which won't be=20
affected immediately because the state will make up for the missing revenue=
.=20
The county's loss could affect raises for all 350 employees, a countywide=
=20
arts program, library hours and improvements to local campgrounds, said Boa=
rd=20
of Supervisors vice chairman Robert Meacher.=20
But the long-term effects are even more disturbing, according to Meacher.=
=20
The utility's $3.2 million annual tax payment makes up about 16 percent of=
=20
the $20 million collected by the county.=20
"The uncertainty over future tax revenues is more of an issue now than the=
=20
actual dollars," said Meacher, who also serves as chairman of the 28-member=
=20
Regional Council of Rural Counties. "Every county that produces hydroelectr=
ic=20
energy for the state of California will be impacted -- some dramatically."=
=20
As of Wednesday morning, Placer County had not received PG&E's second=20
property tax installment of $1.9 million, Treasurer-Tax Collector Jenine=20
Windeshausen said.=20
PG&E officials told Windeshausen that the company will pay a little less th=
an=20
half of the property taxes it owes Placer County.=20
"As far as the county is concerned, we do not anticipate any reduction of=
=20
services due to this," Windeshausen said. "The county has set aside=20
contingencies for these types of situations."=20
He said PG&E's portion represents only slightly more than a half percent of=
=20
the county's total tax collections.=20
"We are going to be proactive in the bankruptcy proceedings. We're definite=
ly=20
pursuing the progress of the bankruptcy court and we're constantly being=20
appraised of our status," Windeshausen said.=20
PG&E pays significant property taxes to Yolo County, according to Don=20
Ishikawa, chief assistant county administrator. Like every county in the=20
state, Yolo keeps only a portion of that money, and the rest is distributed=
=20
to schools, libraries and special districts.=20
Ishikawa said the lost revenue would be a "big hit" for a county with an=20
annual budget of only $210 million. But Yolo has enough money in reserve=20
funds earmarked for property tax losses that there will be no immediate=20
impact, he said.=20
Nevada County Treasurer-Tax Collector E. Christina Dabis said she also is=
=20
waiting for PG&E's second property tax payment of roughly $615,000.=20
"We anticipate getting around $300,000," Dabis said. "Our tax roll is about=
=20
$100 million and they owe us about $600,000, which is less than 1 percent."=
=20
Sacramento County received a $607,794 check from PG&E on Wednesday,=20
representing about 47.5 percent of what was due, said County Assistant Tax=
=20
Collector Linda Pittman.=20
"We'll have to wait for the bankruptcy case to see what we can do," Pittman=
=20
said. "I'm sure we'll be filing a claim with the court for whatever we can.=

El Dorado County received $232,527 of the $489,530 that was due, according =

"It's a buyers' cartel," Shames says. "We would give them a dose of their o=

no, sorry, your price is too high, we'll do without it today.=20
Under this plan, instead of random rolling blackouts sweeping the state=20
without notice, Shames and Navarro suggest rotating outages that are planne=

and telegraphed ahead of time. That would give predictability to business a=

"If the worst thing they can do to us is take away the lights, we might be=

So far, it's a plan that a free-market economist could love. Buyers pooling=

"Nothing wrong with a group of buyers banding together to buy a commodity,"=
=20
Ackerman says. "I've got no problem with that whatsoever. If the price they=

That's where things could get nasty. If the blackouts grew too disruptive,=
=20
Shames and Navarro say, Davis and his counterparts in Oregon and Washington=
=20
would have to be willing to use their emergency powers to seize the plants=
=20
that won't play ball. The threat to the states is too great to sit by while=

"We are very concerned that over the next six months, a combination of mark=

?????Severin Borenstein, director of the UC Energy Institute in Berkeley,=

estimated that the funds would cover enough meters for businesses that=20

?????"It is reasonable to estimate that we could take 2,000 to 3,000=20

Borenstein said.
?????Davis' goal is to shave off at least 2,000 megawatts a day, enough to=

Failure to Buy Entire Network May Doom Davis' Power Deal=20

By MIGUEL BUSTILLO and NANCY VOGEL, Times Staff Writers=20

?????SACRAMENTO--Does it make sense for California to own only part of the=
=20
state's power grid?
?????That question is dividing state legislators and energy experts after=
=20
Gov. Gray Davis' announcement of a $2.76-billion deal to buy Southern=20
California Edison's transmission lines. The deal was reached Monday, three=
=20
days after Pacific Gas & Electric Co. balked at selling its power lines to=
=20
the state and filed for bankruptcy.
?????Davis and Democratic legislators have pushed to purchase the whole=20
transmission system owned by the state's debt-saddled private utilities. Th=
ey=20
reason that by owning the highway that electricity must travel to reach hom=
es=20
and businesses--a 32,000-mile web of wire that is the world's fifth-largest=
=20
coordinated power grid--the state would gain a negotiating advantage with t=
he=20
companies that produce the power.
?????If California's transmission grid were entirely owned by the public,=
=20
political leaders believe, the state could gain jurisdiction over key=20
electricity issues now decided by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,=
=20
which has been reluctant to intervene in the energy crisis. The state, not=
=20
the commission, could then set its own transmission fees and control the fl=
ow=20
of electricity across the grid.
?????Transmission charges bring in roughly $1.4 billion a year for the thre=
e=20
utilities. With that money, the state could not only repay itself for the=
=20
purchase of the power lines but also fund system upgrades to unclog=20
electricity bottlenecks that contribute to blackouts.
?????"Owning the wires is a business, and this business operates at a=20
profit," said Assemblyman Roderick Wright (D-Los Angeles), who will head a=
=20
series of committee hearings on the plan to buy the Edison lines. "We're no=
t=20
going into their yards and buying old trucks or something; we are buying a=
=20
vital piece of their electrical system."
?????However, now that Pacific Gas & Electric has opted to try to find a=20
solution to its debt problem in Bankruptcy Court rather than continue=20
negotiations with the state, the prospects of California acquiring the enti=
re=20
system appear uncertain at best.
?????That is generating concern about what California is getting for its=20
money--and whether the state stands a chance of gaining any independence fr=
om=20
federal regulators--if it buys only the lines of Edison and San Diego Gas &=
=20
Electric.=20
?????The Edison deal, which needs legislative approval, is unlikely to garn=
er=20
a single vote from Republicans--Assembly Republican leader Dave Cox (R-Fair=
=20
Oaks) calls the grid purchase a socialistic idea. The plan may also encount=
er=20
some Democratic opposition.
?????"It was a tough sell to begin with, and I think if you are going to on=
ly=20
buy part, it becomes a tougher sell," said Assemblyman Dean Florez=20
(D-Shafter).
?????And some utility experts say California gains little, if anything,=20
unless it acquires the whole system.
?????"The motivating factor for buying the grid, as opposed to hydroelectri=
c=20
power plants, is because it addressed the central problem facing California=
:=20
The federal government is unwilling to crack down on the generators that ar=
e=20
ripping us off, and we need to take back control," said UC Irvine professor=
=20
Peter Navarro. "If you only buy 40% of the system, you might as well have=
=20
nothing."
?????California would not be able to make some of the most critical upgrade=
s=20
needed to improve the flow of electricity if it did not acquire PG&E's=20
portion of the system. The worst energy bottleneck in California is the=20
notorious Path 15, a series of high-voltage lines that move power between=
=20
Southern and Northern California. Path 15 lies largely in PG&E's territory.
?????Davis and some state legislators say California still has a chance to=
=20
buy the entire grid. Some, in fact, believe that the utility's bankruptcy=
=20
increases the likelihood of a deal: Talks between Davis and PG&E had falter=
ed=20
in recent weeks, and a judge may have better luck bridging their difference=
s.
?????Negotiations between the state and San Diego Gas & Electric continue,=
=20
leaving the possibility of a deal with that utility.
?????But acquiring PG&E's portion, the largest and most important by far, n=
ow=20
requires the approval of a federal Bankruptcy Court judge. And in that aren=
a,=20
the state may have to compete with private companies for the lines.
?????Trans-Elect, a Washington company that wants to create a national=20
network of independently owned transmission lines, has offered to buy and=
=20
operate the grids of Edison and PG&E for a total of $5.25 billion. The=20
company has also been in contact with the Davis administration on the=20
possibility of leasing the lines from California if they are bought by the=
=20
state.
?????For the state to buy any of the systems, it needs approval from=20
FERC--far from a sure thing. The commission in recent years has encouraged=
=20
states to put management of large sections of the nation's transmission gri=
d=20
into private hands to achieve more efficient electricity flow. Even if the=
=20
commission approved the purchase, the state may not receive any increased=
=20
powers.
?????"FERC would like to see one large regional transmission system in the=

West," said David Clement, a transmission expert with Cambridge Energy=20
Research Associates. "If FERC were to unconditionally approve the sale, the=

the transmission system owned by Edison would leave FERC authority. However=

Stanley said, adding that "there is nothing typical about this case."

It's hard to say what California's power cost could be this year because=20

But with market prices spiraling, experts say this year's bill is sure to b=

``The run-up in prices bodes poorly for the state in a big way,'' said=20
Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network=

in San Diego. ``The dollars we're talking about are huge.''=20
The total cost of power in California was $7 billion in 1999 and $27 billio=

Wolak says the tab will more likely be $70 billion.=20

Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California Energy=20

The state is believed to be paying about $50 million a day for power now, b=

It's unclear whether the state's $50 million daily estimate even includes=

operator. State officials refused to discuss the matter.=20
But experts say it's unlikely the state is counting those costs, which now=
=20
are running about $20 million a day.=20
``This is additional money you're paying,'' Wolak said.=20
What has Wolak and other experts more worried, however, is the growing cost=
=20
of electricity futures for this summer.=20
Futures are contracts reserving the right to buy a commodity such as=20
electricity at a set price on a later date. Like stocks and bonds, they are=
=20
traded on several exchanges, including the New York Mercantile Exchange.=20
``Futures prices reflect people's best estimate of what the spot price woul=

Energy companies that trade electricity futures are loathe to talk about th=

Mark Palmer, spokesman for Texas-based Enron Corp., said his company is=20
paying high prices, too. ``If we're buying for $750, we're going to turn=20
around and try to sell at $751,'' he said. ``The spreads between the prices=
=20
at which we're buying and we're selling are tiny.''=20
Experts, however, warn that prices could go higher.=20
In December, when California went to Stage 3 alerts, Pigeon of TransAlta=20
Energy Marketing saw spot prices soar. ``There was a weekend when our coal=

``It would be a game of chicken,'' said Borenstein with the University of=

Dimming chances for resolving power crisis=20
We're still not convinced that the California government should buy the 60=

for $2.76 billion.=20
"The deal would allow the state to take possession of Edison's 12,000-mile=

the Register. "Edison would use that money and issue $2 billion in bonds to=

at high prices that couldn't be passed on to consumers under a rate freeze.
"Both Edison- and state-issued bonds will be paid off by ratepayers via the=

=20
"Edison also agreed to invest $3 billion over five years in improvements to=
=20
the transmission lines. And its corporate parent would contribute $420=20
million to reduce the utility's debt."
In a conference call we joined with other reporters yesterday, Gov. Davis=
=20
explained that he hopes the Legislature will take up the matter when it=20

purchase. He also will meet on Wednesday with Sempra Energy, the parent=20

agreement.
As to Pacific Gas & Electric, which last week declared bankruptcy, he hopes=

to convince "the bankruptcy court that we are the appropriate buyer" of=20
PG&E's portion of the power grid.
We asked the governor about how politics would be kept out of the process o=

what would happen? "Plan B," the governor said, is "we get assets of=20

Utilities Allegedly Gouged Calif.



LOS ANGELES (AP) via NewsEdge Corporation  -
Private power wholesalers have been blamed
for driving up California's electricity prices but even
government-owned utilities allegedly manipulated the market,
maximizing profits and inflaming the energy crisis, according to a
confidential document obtained by the Los Angeles Times.


The document shows that the power providers, including the Los
Angeles Department of Water and Power, influenced the spiraling
costs of wholesale electricity between May and November 2000.


The DWP was eighth on the list of alleged price gougers for
seeking high prices during periods of high demand, which helped
inflate costs across the entire spot market, the document said.


The document decodes the identities of unnamed power providers
in a recent study by the California Independent System Operator.
CISO examined thousands of hours of bidding practices for 20 large
electricity providers.


DWP General Manager S. David Freeman called the findings
``outrageous.''


``We have consistently charged (CISO) our cost plus 15
percent,'' Freeman said. ``It's not as though we're up there
peddling a bunch of power to jam it down their throats.''


In addition to the DWP, the document singles out two other
government-run agencies that it said consistently inflated prices:
the federally owned Bonneville Power Administration in the Pacific
Northwest, and the trading arm of Canada's BC Hydro in British
Columbia.


BC Hydro reaped the most in what the state's power-grid operator
deemed ``excess profits.'' The Canadian agency took in $176
million, several times the amount of allegedly excessive earnings
collected by all but one private generator. Second on the list was
Atlanta-based Mirant which collected nearly $97 million.


The companies cited said they broke no state rules and abided by
California's 1996 deregulation law, the Times reported Wednesday.


BC Hydro officials acknowledged, however, that they anticipated
periods of severe power shortages and let their reservoirs fill
with water overnight, then opened them to produce cheap
hydroelectric power to sell at a premium.


``It was the marketplace that determined what the price of
electricity would be at any given time,'' BC Hydro spokesman Wayne
Cousins told the Times. ``We helped keep the lights on in
California.''

PG&E's Money Transfers Focused On



By MICHAEL LIEDTKE
AP Business Writer
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) via NewsEdge Corporation  -
Pacific Gas and Electric is in bankruptcy
court, but its holding company remains profitable, partly because
the utility transferred billions of dollars to its corporate parent
in the years leading up to its financial collapse. Is this fair?


Whether the money handed over to PG&amp;E Corp. represented business
as usual or a raid on the utility's finances will probably become a
pivotal issue in the bankruptcy case, affecting millions of
customers and thousands of creditors.


>From 1997 through September 2000, the utility paid $4.63 billion
to the parent company and received nothing in return, according to
a state-ordered audit completed in January.


In another controversial move made the night before the Chapter
11 bankruptcy filing April 6, the utility paid 6,000 employees a
total $50 million in bonuses and raises _ an average of more than
$8,000 per worker.


``I would expect that the creditors are going to be looking at
all that transferred money as money that they should have been
getting paid by the utility,'' said bankruptcy professor Judy
Beckner Sloan of the Southwestern University School of Law in Los
Angeles.


To get to the bottom of what happened, lawyers will probably
exhume e-mail exchanges among PG&amp;E management, take depositions
from top executives and pore over reams of documents, said Tampa,
Fla., lawyer Bill Zewadski, co-chairman of the American Bar
Association's bankruptcy litigation subcommittee.


``It's going to be a very complicated process, something that
could drag on for years,'' Zewadski said.


Even if the creditors decide to go after the money that flowed
from the utility to parent company, it will be difficult, if not
impossible, to recover the cash.


Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison, the
state's two biggest utilities, say they have lost more than $13
billion since June because of skyrocketing wholesale power prices
and California's 1996 deregulation law, which bars them from
passing those costs on to customers.


The crisis has led to rolling blackouts over the past few months
and warnings from the two utilities that they were sliding toward
ruin.


PG&amp;E, which made $753 million during the first nine months of
2000, up 40 percent from the same period the year before, already
has spent most of the utility money to pay shareholder dividends
and buy back stock to boost its market value. The parent company
also invested $838 million in its still-thriving power-generating
subsidiaries.


Those unregulated subsidiaries, lumped together as the National
Energy Group, are not a part of the regulated utility, but they
could be pulled into the bankruptcy case if creditors prove the
parent company's investments in National Energy should have been
made in the utility instead.


Should a judge decide the parent company acted wrongfully and
there isn't enough money to repay the utility's creditors, the
bankruptcy code allows for a court judgment holding the parent
company liable, said Kenneth N. Klee, a bankruptcy professor at the
UCLA School of Law.


If the liability were large enough, it could also force the
parent company into bankruptcy.


PG&amp;E executives said they are confident that the parent company
and unregulated subsidiaries will be shielded from the utility's
bankruptcy case.


PG&amp;E chief financial officer Peter Darbee said the parent
company followed all the state's rules governing the relationship
between holding companies and regulated utilities.


The California Public Utilities Commission is not so sure. Three
days before the bankruptcy filing, the regulators opened an
investigation into whether the parent company illegally took the
utility's money or shirked its responsibility to assure the utility
had adequate capital.


The parent company made a move to insulate itself and National
Energy from the utility's financial woes in December when it
received federal regulatory approval to reshuffle its corporate
structure in a maneuver known as ``ringfencing.'' The term refers
to the concept of building a barrier between a company's stable
operations and its high-risk ones.


The walls separating the utility from the parent and other
subsidiaries are, paradoxically, an offshoot of the deregulation
law.


At the time, regulators ordered PG&amp;E to splinter into distinct
companies to protect the then-rich utility in case something went
awry at the parent company or the unregulated businesses.

States say federal government needs to act to stem energy crisis



By H. JOSEF HEBERT
Associated Press Writer
BOISE, Idaho (AP) via NewsEdge Corporation  -
A six-hour brainstorming session between
federal and state energy regulators ended with a clear message:
Western states want more help from Washington to corral the
region's deepening power crisis.


The three members of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
flew to Idaho for what Chairman Curtis Hebert called ``frank
discussions'' with officials from 11 Western states about the
astronomical electricity prices that have spread from California to
almost every corner of the region.


And the Washington regulators got an earful.


``Montana is taking a hell of a hit because of this market,''
declared Gary Feland, whose job it is to approve requests by the
state's utilities to pass wholesale price increases on to their
retail customers.


``Politically we're getting beat up,'' added Feland.


In many states, retail electricity sales are still regulated,
but wholesale markets are not. The state officials warned that many
of the electricity rate increases, stemming from wholesale price
run-ups, have yet to reach consumers, but will in the coming months
as states have no choice but to approve them.


Much of the discussion focused on whether FERC, which regulates
the wholesale power market, should temporarily impose price
controls to ease the impact of what one of the commissioners,
William Massey, called ``a looming disaster'' this summer if
nothing more is done.


Afterward, Hebert tallied up the results: Five states opposed
such controls, three wanted them desperately and three others were
not sure. Previously, the latter three had lined up in the ``no''
column.


Hebert has made clear his opposition to renewed price regulation
_ even temporarily to address an emergency _ because he argues that
a free market is the only way to get people to build more power
plants and transmission lines and create the ``price signal'' to
foster conservation.


His position drew support from Vice President Dick Cheney in a
telephone interview with the Associated Press in Olympia,
Washington.


``The problem with price caps is that they don't solve the
problem,'' said Cheney. ``Just look at California, where they had
caps applied at the retail level that, coupled with the requirement
to buy power on the spot market, has driven PG&amp;E into bankruptcy.''


Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, California's largest utility, said last
week it had debts of dlrs 9 billion and filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection.


Like the state officials, FERC is deeply split on the issue of
price controls.


``It is wrong to put the entire Western economy in harm's way
solely to protect a price signal arising from a dysfunctional
market,'' Massey said. ``Our passion for the market must be
tempered with commonsense.''


A contingent from California submitted a proposal calling for
cost-based price caps for 18 months on wholesale electricity and
natural gas sales across the West. Only FERC can impose such caps.


``We have done our part. We cannot do it alone,'' Bob Herzberg,
speaker of California's Assembly, told the three FERC
commissioners. The Californians listed the state's response to its
power problems so far: Actions to boost conservation, increase
retails electricity rates and speed up power plant construction.
Still, they bemoaned that California this year was expected to
spend dlrs 65 billion on electricity, nearly 10 times its power
bill in 1999.


Hebert insisted that the FERC ``is doing everything it can'' to
ensure just and reasonable prices and cited the commission's action
to seek dlrs 124 million in refunds on California power sales. He
also said the commission plans soon to approve a new system of
tracking market abuses.


Officials from Washington state and Oregon joined California in
the plea for temporary price regulation. The Northwest has been hit
by a severe drought, making less hydro-generated electricity
available and forcing greater reliance on the high-priced spot
market. On Monday the Bonneville Power Authority said it may have
to nearly triple what it charges for its power if demand doesn't
drop sharply and reduce the need of spot market purchases.


In a surprising development, Wyoming, Utah and New Mexico said
they no longer were sure that price controls would be such a bad
thing. And even those opposed to price caps, like Montana's Feland,
criticized FERC for not being more aggressive in challenging prices
_ many of them now 10 times what they were a year ago _ as
unreasonable.

The following would be used only in response to media questions regarding 
PG&E credit exposure.

Enron does not comment on specific credit exposures.  We are confident we 
have established adequate reserves related to energy issues in California and 
regardless of what happens there we are also confident we will meet our 2001 
(recurring) earnings per share estimate of $1.70-$1.75.

(If pressed on the accuracy of the amount listed in PG&E's declaration)  
There are lots of numbers being tossed around for all parties that are owed 
money by PG&E.  All of them are subject to to modification as information is 
corrected or updated.  The numbers in PG&E's initial filing were estimates 
based on six month old PG&E data that may have been assembled very quickly.

(If pressed on the amount in the creditor committee letter)  Enron will not 
comment on specific credit exposures.  We will not confirm or deny any such 
numbers rumored to be in confidential correspondence.  Any number presented 
would need to be further examined relative to collateral, reserves and other 
credit offsets available under the circumstances.  Again, we are very 
confident that no event related to this issue will prevent us from meeting 
our 2001 (recurring) earnings per share estimate of $1.70-$1.75.

If we are asked if we filed to be on the creditor committee, I would confirm 
that we did, and we are.

Mark

Pacific Gas and Electric Company Receives Court Approval of Second-Day Motions



SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 9, 2001 via NewsEdge Corporation  -

Utility Granted Authority to Continue Efforts to Secure Natural Gas


Supplies, Use Cash Collateral for Normal Business Operations


Pacific Gas and Electric Company today received approval from the
U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California, of
various second-day motions.


These orders will enable Pacific Gas and Electric Company to
continue to fulfill post-petition obligations to suppliers and other
creditors without disruption, and so that all parties' interests are
considered, and treated fairly. The goal of these early proceedings is
to assure stability of the company, in accordance with bankruptcy law.


The court granted the utility the authority to continue to use its
natural gas revenues to secure future supplies, hopefully ensuring
that there will be no disruption of service for millions of natural
gas customers.


The court also authorized interim use of cash collateral in which
mortgage bondholders have a beneficial interest, and scheduled and
established deadlines relating to a final hearing on the continued use
of cash collateral.


Also today, Pacific Gas and Electric Company asked the Court to
allow at least a 60 day suspension of a requirement approved by the
CPUC on March 27, that would force PG&amp;E to restate all its regulatory
books and accounts back to Jan. 1, 1998 in order to prolong the
current electric rate freeze and make it appear that PG&amp;E has never
incurred any operating losses on its wholesale power costs since the
energy crisis began.


Under the CPUC order, PG&amp;E is required to file tariffs and reports
by Wednesday, April 11, making the accounting changes and restating
its books. PG&amp;E believes the CPUC accounting and ratemaking change is
intended to interfere with the rights of creditors and shareholders to
recover over $8.9 billion in undercollected power costs that the
company has accrued since last summer. Under federal bankruptcy law,
PG&amp;E, as a "debtor in possession," generally has an additional 60 days
to comply with various deadlines issued by other agencies, and actions
by those agencies which would interfere with creditors rights and the
value of PG&amp;E's assets cannot be implemented without approval of the
bankruptcy judge.


At the Court's request, Pacific Gas and Electric Company and the
CPUC are currently negotiating on an extension of this filing
requirement, and is hopeful that an agreed upon solution can be
reached in a timely manner.

I attended the hearings on PGE's two cash collateral motions today.  Both 
were granted on an interim basis.  The court set a final hearing for May 9 at 
9:30 am.  PGE is to file its pleadings by April 20 and any opposition is due 
by May 4.

The bondholder cash collateral motion was heard first.  There was no 
opposition and the bond trustee (Bank of New York) consented to the relief.  
BONY and PGE are working on a final cash collateral stipulation.

Next was the gas supplier motion.  PGE mentioned in its presentation that the 
basis of the pre-petition agreement was the waiver of termination rights in 
the event of bankruptcy by the suppliers in return for a security interest in 
the receivables.  Jim Lopes, PGE's lawyer, mentioned that he had learned a 
great deal about Bankruptcy Code section 556 in the last few months.  Judge 
Montali nodded his head at that comment.  Montali also asked whether PGE 
conceded that 556 applied.  Lopes answered that he did not concede that it 
applied, but he was "very concerned."

I asked whether the post-petition security interest was available to 
suppliers that were not parties to the pre-petition agreements.  The Court 
said that was up to PGE; Lopes said they were willing to talk about it, but 
they did not want to grant liens to all of their creditors and hoped 
creditors would rely on their administrative claims, which PGE believes will 
be paid in the ordinary course.  Procedurally, the Court said it would not 
authorize any new security interests on the basis of the interim order 
resulting from today's hearing.  Instead, that would have to be the subject 
of a separate motion with notice, and perhaps coujld be taken up at the final 
hearing.
P
 GE also indicated that it is filing today a lawsuit against the CPUC seeking 
a TRO regarding a deadline of April 11 for the filing of certain advice 
letters.  A hearing is tentatively scheduled on the TRO for 3 pm tomorrow, 
April 10.

There was also discussion of various administrative matters, like scheduling 
hearings, entering a case management order, etc.

A representative of a consumer group, the Coalition for Public Power, read a 
statement asking Judge Montali to rollback rates and to force PGE's parent to 
pay the utility's debts.  The Judge let them speak, but made it clear that it 
was not an action item, and seemed generally to ignore them.

The courtroom was packed with attorneys, journalists and members of the 
public.  After the hearing, the reporters all descended upon the attorneys 
for PGE and the CPUC.  The courtroom is in an office building in SF's 
financial district; there were probably ten TV cameras set up on the sidewalk 
as well as several protesters carrying signs.

Please call me if you have any questions.
