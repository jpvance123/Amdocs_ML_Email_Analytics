I  am glad you will be able to make it.  I agree that I have never been  hit in the head bowling, but it is still similar to other sports for me in  that I am not any good.  I still have fun though!
 
Are you going to be able to make the BBQ too?

We regret to announce that Rick Bergsieker has decided to leave Enron to pursue other interests.  Rick has led our commercial activities in the Middle East for the past several years.  Rick is a highly respected individual within the company as well as within the energy sector, and we will miss his contributions.

With Rick's departure, we are realigning the Global LNG group into the following four separate functional areas: Americas Origination, European and Pacific Origination, New Asset Implementation and Trading and Logistics.  These functional areas will report to Eric Gonzales who will be assuming lead responsibility for the Global LNG business unit.

Within the Americas Origination effort, Doug Arnell will take the group leadership for activities within the Atlantic Basin.  The priorities for Doug's group include the continued development of the Bahamas Terminal and the implementation of the Elba terminal agreement.  The current teams focused on the VLNG project and North American West Coast project are also part of the Americas effort and will continue reporting directly to Eric.

Clay Harris will expand his role to lead the European and Pacific Origination function from the London office.  Reporting to Clay will be the existing Pacific Origination team as well as the members of the London based LNG team.  

The New Asset Implementation group will be led by Greg Curran.  Greg's group will be focusing on the successful implementation of construction and initial operations of our LNG assets under development. 

The Trading and Logistics groups will continue reporting to Jonathan Whitehead. 

Please join us in wishing Rick well for the future, and congratulating Eric, Doug, Clay, and Greg on their new and expanded roles.

Mike McConnell & Jeff Shankman

Hi Jason,
 Dad and I are going out of town for a few days.
As I've tried to tell you at least twice, an IRS check is here for you. Do
you want it deposited in your checking account?
 Also, did I send you the picture of Mikayl in the UH shirt/

Take a look at the groups to visit west power at some point.  I will still need to discuss this rotation with the Portland guys before we set the dates.  Please take a look at the groups and make certain there are no conflicts with trading coverage.

Thanks,
Mike

Karen Denne, vice president of Public Relations, received some interesting questions about Enron's dealings with the media in her eSpeak session on July 24.  Here's one of them:

I am new to Enron, and the "pie in the face" incident occurred just after I began working here. I have had several friends ask me about that. My questions are: 1) How did we "spin" this issue (i.e., the problems with Cal. AND the fact that we got pie thrown on one of our main players) 2) Was he mad about it, or did he laugh it off? 3) Is this a pie incident kind of a good thing, because it gets people talking about the issues and Enron or do we look silly?

Want to know how she responded?  Check out her full eSpeak transcript at http://ethink.enron.com/eSpeak/exec/default.asp.

Jason,
 I forgot to tell you about the bridal shower on Sat. Reagan laughed about
your comment about singing in English class. She said to tell you "hi".
Jamie Kalmer and Reagan looked about the same but NOT Jeanne Hofbauer! She's
going to McKendree College and working at Good Ol'Days restaurant in New
Baden. She must be getting part of her wages in food! WHOA! Is she big!
Looks like she put on about 70 pounds. I almost didn't recognize her.
 Anyway, just thought I'd give you  the news.
Love, Mom

Jason-

True love conquers all, including Aggie traditions and the fact that she
is not Catholic.  I think that it is sort of sweet.  It is kind of cool
when your friends surprise you like that.  I always saw Stu wanting
to get married and have kids, but I figured that he would have dropped
some hints before he popped the question.  What does he think that I
can't keep my mouth shut (verbal irony here).  Stu broke the news to
Matt by telling him that he would be moving out in 9 months (don't read
into the time span...no significance as far as I am aware).  Matt
said ok, and then Stu added "because I am getting married" and then
Matt let loose a string of holy !@$#$%$ type words.  I guess it is?more emotionally taxing to men when their friends get married.??Later,?Tami

Do you know that Enron is committed to providing procurement opportunities to minority and women-owned business enterprises?  Do you know how it works?  Ask Calvin Eakins, director of Minority & Women Business Development about his group's goals for 2001.  Tuesday, July 10 on eSpeak at 10 a.m. Houston time.

Can't make the live event?  No worries.  Go to eSpeak (http://ethink.enron.com/eSpeak/exec/default.asp) now and submit your question.  Calvin will try to answer it during his event and you can read the transcript later.


How do you feel about Enron's cost savings initiatives? Have you thought of some innovative ways to save money?  Talk amongst yourselves in eMeet  http://nahou-lnapp01.corp.enron.com/eThink/eMeet.nsf .



This week's ideas deposited into the Idea Vault include such interesting concepts as California time-of-day remote metering via broadband and prepaid gas cards.  Go to the Thinkbank (http://nahou-lnapp01.corp.enron.com/eThink/Thinkbank.nsf/HomePage?OpenPage) for all the details.

with me. Then I get some messages. I thought you said you were going

Yeah, when I get up to Maine you better be ready. 'Cause I'LL be ready.

The deadline for the Enron Business Top 10 List contest is upon you!  Be sure to get your entries in by the end of the day Friday, July 27.  Ten winners will receive a $20 gift certificate to the Enron Signature Shop.

You'll find the newest EB in your mailbox at home and online at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com> under Publications, Enron Business, and "Volume 3, 2001."  (And if you're in Houston, you might find a few extra copies at the Plaza Java in the lobby of the Enron Building.)

Hi Jason,
 Grandma and Jill got the packages on Mon.
Also, yesterday you received a check from the IRS. It looks like a separate
letter came too. Do you want me to deposit the check in your checking
account? Do you want me to send the letter or open it to see if it's
important?
 I had to take Grandma to the eye doctor today. (The specialist) It must've
been senior citizen appointment day. It was the routine exam she has once a
year where they dilate her pupils and examine the eyes. Normally, we've been
out of there in 20 to 30 minutes. Today it was 2 and a half hours.
 It is dangerously hot again today.
,Hope it cools down before Dad sprays the trees and shrubs. This area has
had a major infestation of Japenese beetles.
 Better go for now. I  took the mail in and I see that Dad's card is here.
 Love, Mom

Hi Jason!
 What have you been up to? I miss hearing from you.
The Board approved our .40 an hour raise plus the insurance, the a 4%
increase a year for the next 2 years. They also have to pay any increases in
the insurance rates. This year they increased 20% so at least that's covered
for 3 years.
 Grandma and Grandpa are going to see Grant for 10 days in August. They'll
ride the train to Oregon.
Just wanted to say "hi". Hopefully, we'll have a chance to talk to you this
weekend.
 Love, Mom

August 1st, you will have your positions in your new financial and physical=

I will tell him what I know, although I haven't looked at a food processor in some time.  

Matt - I would suggest you talk to Matt Gravelle from ConAgra.  I have done him some favors over the years.  They are a big food processor with Beatrice Hunt Wesson.  He will know all the big tomato processors which are 80% of the food processing load.  Others include Tri-Valley.  I would try to get as many names and phone numbers as you can and call them up and ask them their plans.  My bet is cooler and wetter weather will result in a lower and later harvest and hence gas usage.  
The fruit driers are the other 20% and they are much less concentrated and it will be hard to get a handle on their usage.

Also, what's up with EES?  Do they have any marketers anymore?  Dan Bergmann used to be very effective in getting deals done with the food processors, but they laid him off.

I would like to have Matt Smith, West Fundamentals, call you to discuss the food processing load in CA.  He wants to pick your brain on how to gather more information on this business sector.

Thanks,

Subject:	proposed sitara report

Krishna,

I am looking to create a new report based on an existing sitara report that generates a deal list by pub code to estimate
various indexes during bid week. This was first made for Anne Bike, West Desk risk group.

The purpose of this new report is to generate a list of Desk-To-Desk deals for a given period and desk and generate a WACOG.
The parameters for this new query include:

>From and To Dates
Gas location (including All)
Desk (including All)

It should return to and from dates, volume, price, location, sitara number, tagg number, eol number (if any), and desk
It should generate subtotal volumes and WACOG for each desk, and each pipe location in each desk

Desks include: ENA - IM WSOCAL, ENA - IM WSJ, ENA - IM WKEYSTONE, ENA - IM WPGE, ENA - IM WROCKIES

If possible, the data should export into excel.

Thanks,
Jason Wolfe
Trading Analyst, West Desk

The collective efforts of the trading operations support teams within EWS to develop and improve our services have now positioned EWS to promote and commercialize our business activities. My expanded focus in support of successfully commercializing our effort dictates that I announce, effective immediately, new assignments for members of my Global Risk Management Operations management team. 

Bob Hall will lead operations for Enron Americas. Bob previously served as one of the business controllers for gas operations for Enron Americas, with direct responsibility for Gas Logistics and Volume Management.  The leadership team reporting to Bob will include Peggy Hedstrom (Calgary Operations), Jeff Gossett ( U.S. Gas Risk and South America Operations), Stacey White (U.S. Power Risk), Leslie Reeves (U.S. Gas and Power Confirmations and Settlements), and Bob Superty (U.S. Gas Logistics). 

Brent Price will continue to lead Operations for Enron Global Markets and fulfill his dual role as Chief Accounting Officer for Enron Global Markets. 

I am very pleased to announce that Kevin Sweeney will lead Operations for Enron Industrial Markets.  Kevin brings to his new role extensive risk and operations experience from stints in our Houston, London and Singapore offices.  Kevin fills the role that was previously held by Brenda Herod, who will now report directly to Beth Apollo. 

Beth Apollo will be the Operations Project Manager for the assimilation of EES Wholesale. This will include Deal Capture, Risk Analysis,  Confirmations, and Global Data functions which have been moved into EWS under Global Risk Management Operations.  Successfully leveraging the infrastructure to support the EES business plan will also require close coordination with Gas Logistics, Settlements and the Operational Analysis (OA) process, and Beth will actively coordinate operations efforts with these teams and the commercial teams.  I have asked Beth to project manage the effort to look for opportunities to streamline and improve systems, processes and controls, and to consider alignment, where it makes sense, with existing EWS processes.  Reporting to Beth will be Scott Mills, with a focus on Deal Capture, Risk Analysis and Confirmations, and  Brenda Herod, with a focus on invoicing control guidelines and reporting requirements. 

Beth will also continue to manage the Global Services function, which includes the consolidated DPR process and Global Operations Standards, led by Shona Wilson, and the Global Data function which is lead by James Scribner.

Mike Jordan will continue to lead operations for Enron Europe, working closely with me and other EWS operations leads to insure the proliferation of best operational practices worldwide for Enron.   

Thanks for your continued support especially in exploring and seizing commercial opportunities to strengthen our contributions to Enron.

GO COOGS!!!

As we approach the middle of summer, Cougars@Enron is gearing up for the fall season.  Below is information on FAQ's, Committees, Football Tickets and All Alumni Meeting.

FAQ's
If I attended UH Clear Lake, can I participate in Cougars@Enron?
YES!!  Cougars@Enron includes alumni from all the UH campuses: Clear Lake, Downtown, Victoria and the future Sugarland campus.

Are there still Board of Director seats available?
YES!!  However, we only have a few remaining.  Please contact me at 713-853-3446 for details.

Committees
Every UH alumni is invited to participate in or chair our various committees.  We want each of you to have the opportunity to be involved in your alumni organization.  If you are interested in being a part of one or more of these committees, please call me a 713-853-3446.  Below is info on the types of committees and those that still need chairs:

Golf (need Chair) - This is our most important committee as it brings great revenue for scholarships and to our group.  Our next Golf Tournament will be held March 25, 2002.  Even though it is 9 months away, this committee works year round to find sponsors, golfers, and golf teams as well as arranging awards, golf goodies, etc.  This is a GREAT networking opportunity and LOTS of fun.

Fundraising - This group will create creative and innovative ideas to help raise funds for Cougars@Enron.  This will allow us to provide more receptions, bigger tailgate parties and goodies to all alumni.

Tailgate Parties - Jeff McClellan, past President, is still Chair for this committee.  This group will assist in finding sponsors for food and beverage, help set up the area (tent is done for us) and think of creative ideas to increase attendance.

Happy Hours (need Chair) - Think of places to hold happy hours, schedule with those establishments, negotiate food and beverage discounts and bring in guest speakers.

Brown Bags (need Chair) - Schedule guest speakers and room for Brown Bags.  Topics can include UH Education, UH Sports or Enron information.

Social Committee (need Chair) - This group will schedule and plan the Christmas Party and any other large social events.  This includes budgeting and working with catering services for the events.

Football Tickets
There is still an opportunity to purchase Season Tickets for the 2002 UH Football Season!!  Jeff McClellan is continuing to handle season ticket purchases.  You can contact Jeff at "jmccle1@entergy.com" or myself for information and applications.  Here is the schedule:

Sept 1 - Rice		7:00pm
Sept 22 - UT		7:00pm
Sept 29 - TCU	7:00pm
Oct 13 - Memphis	7:00pm
Oct 20 - Cincinn	7:00pm
Nov 17 - UAB		7:00pm

Undoubtedly, the UT and Rice games will be the most popular.  UH and Mattress Mac from Gallery Furniture will be holding several events including a Ferrari giveaway, chili cook-off with over 250 teams at the UT game and a free concert.  Season Ticket prices for all 6 games start at $150!!!  Contact Jeff for more info.

All Alumni Meeting
Mark your calendars!  We have scheduled our All Alumni Meeting to be held on Thursday, August 23rd. You will meet the new officers and board members, get information on upcoming events and have the opportunity to ask questions.  Since we feel that this is such an important event, we are offering two sessions to give you the chance to attend.  The first session will be held from 11:30 - 1:00 in EB5C2.  The next session will be that evening (Location and time TBA).


GO COOGS!

Jason:  This is just to remind you that we have a report out there in SITARA, that might help you.  We can have it modified to include internal trades only.  I will leave the ball in your court, if you need an explanation of the report, or want me to show you how to run it, let me know.

Bike,
Can you please run the Deal Fixed Price report on development machine. Now you can able to run one report that captures all five of the new West businessunits in one report as opposed to having to run five separate reports.  All five business units roll up into one named West Intramonth Position.  

 Packaged Businessunits are as follows:

ENA - IM WKEYSTON
ENA - IM WPGE
ENA - IM WROCKIES
ENA - IM WSJ
ENA - IM WSOCAL

Dave:  The Deal Fixed Price Report has been a very valuable tool.  Thank you and Krishna for your efforts.  I have a question for you regarding our transition into multiple books and how it will affect the report.  Beginning in July the West desk will have several physical books instead of just the one ENA-IM West book.  The new books are as follows:

ENA - IM WKEYSTON
ENA - IM WPGE
ENA - IM WROCKIES
ENA - IM WSJ
ENA - IM WSOCAL

We would like to be able to run one report that captures all five of the new books in one report as opposed to having to run five separate reports.  In the position manager for SITARA, we have all five books roll up into one named West Intramonth Position.  Would it be possible to have something similar for this report ?

Please let me know your thoughts.

Thank you.

Anne Bike

Baby News!

EnFORM,
It is my great privilege to announce one of EnFORM  Technology's greatest 'deliveries' since our small company began over  three years ago.   As  you may have heard, on June1st,  at 6:46pm,a small handful of EnFORMers  completed one of the most ambitious technology integration projects in the  history of modern B2B e-commerce initiatives.TrueQuote.com, a web based energy trading exchange, successfully  interfaced it's product and trading transaction engine to the largest  e-commerce site in the world, Enron Corporation's EnronOnline.com. EnronOnline trades approximately $3Billion in energy related products and  services every day making it (by  far)the largest e-commerce platform in  the world.
The magnitude of this achievement can not be understated.  Many doubted that it was technically feasible, and many others thought it was  out-right impossible to keep the trading engines of two completely different  platforms completely synchronized. Well, it is with great pride that I report  to you that since going live with the interface, TrueQuote.com (developed  using SQL Server 2000, VB / COM+, ASP, and a whole-lotta XML) not only keeps in  lock-step synchronization with EnronOnline.com (a Java, Oracle8i, and Web-logic platform), the two platforms have exchanged  over 1.25Million orders in just a few weeks, averaging between 50-75,000every daywith  less than a 1/2 second of latency between the two platforms for each  order.
When you get a chance,  congratulate the team for delivering such an impressive achievement.   Since going live, the baby hasn't even burped!
-Stewart

Krishna,

I am looking to create a new report based on an existing sitara report that generates a deal list by pub code to estimate
various indexes during bid week. This was first made for Anne Bike, West Desk risk group.

The purpose of this new report is to generate a list of Desk-To-Desk deals for a given period and desk and generate a WACOG.
The parameters for this new query include:

>From and To Dates
Gas location (including All)
Desk (including All)

It should return to and from dates, volume, price, location, sitara number, tagg number, eol number (if any), and desk
It should generate subtotal volumes and WACOG for each desk, and each pipe location in each desk

Desks include: ENA - IM WSOCAL, ENA - IM WSJ, ENA - IM WKEYSTONE, ENA - IM WPGE, ENA - IM WROCKIES

If possible, the data should export into excel.

Thanks,
Jason Wolfe
Trading Analyst, West Desk

ahhhh hume.  let's get metaphysical.

yeah things are going well, if a little dull.  i talked to ellwanger last
night, it sounds like he is a little bored, and frustrated with having
nothing to do.

kami and i are doing good, we celebrate two years together this weekend.
we seem to be spending all of our time going to weddings, and my first
college friend had a baby last night.  it is all so grown up.  i even
bought saran wrap for the first time.

how's your lady friend?  anything going on?  do you eat lunch?  do you play
basketball?

i have mounted a plastic spoon catapult on my desk.

soul peace and hair grease, clay

Clay-Flexxx-

Good to hear from you. I am doing fine, but my job has left me ignorant
of anything but what is presented to me daily on one of 3 flat screen
monitors.
I hope you (and your significant other) (and, the rest of your people) are
doing well.
I miss the irreplaceable "culture sophistique" provided by you and
Hotwanger.

Shout back at me, foo

Subject:	Western Natural Gas Organization

	
Dear Western Region:

	I would like to thank Phillip Allen for his leadership of the west desk for 2000 and 2001.  He will continue as Managing Director at Enron North America and trade a financial book for the natural gas trading group.  Phillip will be sitting near the western region and will continue to participate in our goal to analyze the western market fundamentals to maximize wholesale trading efforts.  I will be assuming all management responsibilities of the west trading group effective immediately.

	I would like to take the opportunity to discuss our new organization for the Western Region trading group.  I have organized a vertical based trading structure that clearly defines each employee's responsibilities going forward.   Our goal is to organize all of our efforts in the west such that we will offer Enron North America the most profitable wholesale trading model.

The most significant change to the western region organization will be Keith Holst's role as Director of West Fundamentals.  Keith will manage this unit from the west desk, while using the services of Enron's centralized fundamentals group, headed by Chris Gaskill.  Our western region Fundamentals group will be responsible for delivering the most complete and market sensitive data to the trading desk.  We will all share in Keith's efforts to make our fundamental analysis the standard for all trading units within the company.

West Origination, led by Barry Tycholiz, will play a larger role in our term trading efforts going forward.  They will be joining our desk for fundamental forecasting meetings and discussions.  Our goal is to capture a majority of the term risk management efforts of our customer base.  We must succeed in capturing a majority of our customers' business to increase our share of lower risk earnings.  This contribution, along with our wholesale trading, will help our desk beat earnings expectations consistently.     

The West trading organization is structured to maximize profitability by sub-region.  The emphasis for the trading group will be to increase profitability and market information from each trader's sub-region.   We will be evaluated on how we organize and build the business and profitability in our respective trading areas.  This structure, however, does not preclude west traders from trading positions throughout the Western region and the North American gas market.  The West trading organization will be successful by creating accountability for trading responsibilities.
  
Please review the attached outline for the new trading structure.  We will be meeting as a group to discuss the changes soon.  The implementation of this structure will rely on our back office to set up the new books for each trader.  

Sincerely,

Michael D. Grigsby
West Gas Trading

 and a 10-year storage capacity agreement that also provides transportation=
.  The toll conversion agreement calls for EGLI to deliver a combination of=
 feedstocks (methanol, natural gas, and normal butane) to be converted into=
 various offtake products, primarily MTBE.=20

As a part of the 10-year conversion agreement, EGLI has the option to conve=
rt the facility into an Iso Octane plant.  The option to convert is EGLI's =
sole and exclusive right.  In addition, the call helps to mitigate the regu=
latory risk associated with the MTBE market.

Prior to the close of the 10-year conversion and storage capacity agreement=
s, Enron's corporate development group organized the sale of the hydrocarbo=
n-processing complex in Morgan's Point, Texas, and a liquids pipeline grid =
system to EOTT for approximately $120 million.  The asset sale was predicat=
ed on the agreements to be entered into between EGLI and EOTT. =20

These combined agreements represent EGM's largest transaction to date.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron Secures First Industrial Customer Gas Supply Deal In Germany=20
Congratulations to the German Gas Origination team for closing its first ph=
ysical supply contract with an industrial customer.  The customer, based in=
 Stendal, Germany, operates steam boilers for a milk factory and will be ta=
king gas from Enron for a contract of 9.3 MW of interruptible one-year base=
 load.

In connection with this supply contract the Continental Gas Trading team co=
mpleted a gas supply transaction, the first inside Germany by a non-incumbe=
nt player, with EnBW at Steinitz, to overcome capacity constraints expected=
 in Q3 this year.  Due to the fragmented gas industry in Germany, Enron had=
 to secure transport with no less than four network operators inside German=
y in order to close the gas supply deal.  "Although we are happy that we ha=
ve successfully secured all necessary transportation to fulfill our contrac=
tual obligations, it was quite a challenge to reach agreement with four net=
work operators -- while this was a transaction only within Germany, the neg=
otiation with the network operators was as complex as securing gas transpor=
t from Ireland through the UK and Belgium into France," commented Carsten H=
aack, who closed this deal together with Helge-Juergen Beil, Ulrich Finke a=
nd Gordon Smith from the German Gas Origination team.  Another important el=
ement of the deal is that the team succeeded in establishing the first tran=
sportation contract for VNG, Germany's largest German import company after =
Ruhrgas. "This contract will serve as a useful basis for future gas deals, =
especially in East Germany, " said Haack. "But more importantly, this deal =
will send a message to the market that once again Enron has proven to custo=
mers it can deliver on its promises and, of equal importance, that network =
operators had better take our transportation requests seriously!" he added.

ETOL Celebrates New Deals With Du Pont
Congratulations to Enron Teesside Operations Ltd (ETOL) for signing a serie=
s of deals with chemical giant Du Pont for supplies to its facilities at Wi=
lton International.

A new arrangement between the two parties means Enron will supply two milli=
on tonnes of steam and 30 MW of electricity a year to Du Pont's nylon plant=
s. New agreements have also been reached for gas supplies, and for the prov=
ision of a number of key site services including pipeline maintenance, secu=
rity and emergency response.

Paul Gavens, CEO of ETOL, said: "Securing an exclusive long-term supply agr=
eement of this nature with one of our largest customers is a fantastic achi=
evement for ETOL. The new arrangements extend the terms of our current cont=
ract for steam and power to 2010, restructure the pricing arrangements and =
offer the opportunity for adding value to both companies by optimizing the =
operation of their respective assets."


Enron's Northernmost Partner!
Enron Nordic Energy has entered into a partnership agreement with Varanger =
Kraft AS.  Under the terms of the deal, Enron Nordic Energy will assist Var=
anger in hedging its power sales, power prices and area prices.  The partne=
rship will also involve the development of a risk strategy for Varanger and=
 the provision of weather risk products relating to water flow and temperat=
ure risk.  In addition, the agreement will open opportunities for Enron to =
develop contacts with Varanger Kraft's Russian partners and the Russian mar=
ket generally.  Following a deal with Luster Energiverk, this is the second=
 such agreement closed by Enron Nordic Energy in recent weeks.

This is our first partner in the Nordic region with established relationshi=
ps in Russia, through its ownership of a grid connected to Russia.  Varange=
r has hydro power plants on the Passvik river near the Russian border.  As =
the Passvik river flows on both sides of the border, Varanger works in coop=
eration with Russian partners to manage the water storage.=20

Yes, THE Yoko!

Enron has graciously agreed to be an underwriter for the "Yes Yoko Ono" exhibit at the Contemporary Arts Museum (CAM).  The Associate and Analyst Program has 25 pairs of tickets to the "Members Only" exhibition preview on Friday, July 13, 2001 starting at 9:00 pm.  Yoko will be in attendance.

We have decided to hold a raffle for these tickets with the proceeds going to SEARCH's House of Tiny Treasures, a long-time favorite of the program.  The House of Tiny Treasures, a licensed child-care facility for homeless children, was heavily damaged during the recent floods and is in need of donations to help with repairs.

Each winner will receive tickets for two to the exhibit and an invitation to a cocktail reception before the event.  Chances will go on sale Tuesday July 9th at EB3520a (Jackie Coleman) and EB3521a (Donna Jones).  You can buy one chance for $5.00 or three for $10.00.  The drawing will be held on Thursday, July 12th at 5:00 pm.  The winner need not be present to win.

Please call John Walt at x35379 with any questions

I invite you to provide feedback on the Analyst & Associate Program, using a very short, anonymous and confidential survey. In the very near future, you will receive an email from ramabile@execlead.com asking for feedback on your overall satisfaction with the Program, and your suggestion of one thing we should focus on for improvement. To insure confidentiality of your responses, Executive Leadership has been engaged to conduct and compile the results of the survey. 
The survey is designed to be completed in about two minutes, and your participation is important. We plan to do short surveys like this a couple of times each year, in addition to the all employee survey. As always, I invite each of you to contact me or anyone on my team if you'd like to discuss ideas or issues in person. 
Thank you in advance for your participation, 
Billy Lemmons

In addition to my current role of leading ENA's Wholesale Gas Structuring, I have been asked to take on ENA's Retail Gas Structuring for EES.  

I have asked Mark Breese to take the lead on all EES related activity effective immediately.  Mark will maintain a lead role on a couple of important wholesale transactions that are ongoing, but he will not be taking on any new wholesale deals.  Eric Moon will retain his lead role on all West Region deals and will take the lead on all new East Region deals.  Eric Boyt will retain his lead role for all Upstream and ECR deals, and will back up Eric Moon on new East Region deals as needed.  Santiago Garcia (Associate) has chosen to stay in Gas Structuring for his third rotation to contribute his needed experience to the team.  Finally, several Associates and Analysts are being added to Gas Structuring to handle increased Wholesale deal flow and the EES effort.

Mark Breese, Melissa Solis and I have moved to the 14th floor and we will office at the following locations:

	Mark Breese	EB-1457a
	Ed McMichael	EB-1456c
	Melissa Solis	EB-1456d

We are moving to the 14th floor to initially be closer to the EES business as well as free up space on the 32nd floor.  This move is temporary as all Gas Structuring (wholesale and retail) will be located together on the 6th floor in the new building.

Hi Jason,
 Hope you'll have time to answer my messages today.
 We just wanted you to let you know not to bother to bring your suit to
Dad's retirement. A shirt and tie will be fine. (However, pants are NOT
optional!)
 Dad received the Father's day card yesterday. It was a riot! I think Dad is
finished with the tattoos though.
.Please let me know about the check.
 Love, Mom

When: Sat. August 4th 
Time: Noon 
Price per game (per person) - $2 
Price for pair of shoes - $1 
After bowling, we will head over to Bob's house for barbeque.  Here are the 
details for the barbeque: 
Where: Bob Volpe's house (about 25 minutes South from the Enform/TrueQuote 
office)

What to bring: We will need a head count and then be asking people to bring 
items like side dishes, napkins, paper plates, cups, condiments, chips and 
dip, etc.  Bob will be providing the hotdogs, hamburgers and beverages, so 
we will need to do our share! 
Dress code: It is Houston...it is the summer...please dress comfortable!! 
Feel free to bring spouses, friends, family, significant others, etc.  Just 
remember to include them in your head count. 
So...what I need from you is your total headcount including yourself by next 
Tuesday, July 31st.  Please let me know which specific activity/activities 
you will be able to make, so Bob knows how much food to buy and I can 
reserve enough lanes for bowling. 
Thanks!  I am looking forward to seeing all of you!!

You can go there directly and see if this will help you.

That picture is of an alfalfa field during irrigation with Mount Signal in
the background. The picture was taken for IID by Marvin Wieben Jr., a local
photographer. If I can be of further assistance, let me know.

As many of you know already, Final Fantasy opens tomorrow, but I'll be seeing it Thursday evening with whoever wants to come along.  Because my Evolution team and I have yet to make it to that one, I suggest we go see it tomorrow evening when Final Fantasy will draw the biggest crowd away from Evolution.

j-flizexxx,

it was good to see you while i was in town.  i still can't believe you stood
me up on saturday though...  youre lucky i had a good evening without you.

i had an insane trip home.  i got stuck in memphis overnight because of bad
weather in boston.  it sucked, i got home 16 hours later than i was supposed
to, and i had to pay for my own hotel room since it wasn't the airlines
