		 Subject: Dabhol Power Project - Arbitration-Related Materials


I attach the results of a first trawl through the archives.

Of the attached materials,I think that the most relevant,for present
purposes,will be the following:-

(1) the enforcement memo produced by Peter Cornell and Atul Rajadhyaksha;

(2) the final consent award (as I drafted it) (the tribunal made the award
in the terms requested so far as I can recall;we are retrieving the original
from the papers in storage).

Item (2) above binds the GOM in relation to the PPA,SSA and the GOM
Guarantee. However,strictly,the MSEB is not bound,because it was never a
party to the 2 arbitrations begun by DPC in August 1995.

I attach for your review the final draft of the proposed Enron U.S. Foreign 
Corrupt Practices Act Policy.  As I mentioned this morning, this draft is the 
result of many months of work by Mary Nell Browning, Bob Williams, Joe Dilg 
(Vinson and Elkins) and Martin Weinstein (Foley and Lardner).  I would like 
to roll this policy out early in the new year and so would appreciate 
receiving your comments as soon as possible but not later than the end of 
this year.

Please feel free to call me if you have any questions or need any 
information.  Thanks.

Rob

Privileged and Confidential Attorney-Client Communication;  Attorney Work 
Product

We may need to file a suit this week or next to enjoin the signing of a gas 
supply agreement between Petrobras and Compagas.  As you know, Enron 
(Dutapar), Copel, and Petrobras are the three shareholders of Compagas.  
Copel has as interest (along with El Paso) in the power plant which would use 
the gas.  A contract has already been signed between Compagas and the plant.  
The Compagas Board votes on the agreement tomorrow.  The gas supply contract 
would have a 20-year term and would be worth $1.2 billion.  The ground for 
the suit would be that, under Brazilian law, Compagas is required to solicit 
bids for the gas supply arrangement.   Compagas has sought to justify not 
soliciting bids on the basis that Petrobras is the only supplier capable of 
supplying the gas.  This is incorrect:  Enron, among others, is also capable 
of supplying the gas.  We have a legal opinion supporting our position. and 
have called for a special shareholders' meeting to discuss the issue.  We 
anticipate that Petrobras and Copel, despite their obvious conflict of 
interest, will force the issue and will vote in favor of the agreement 
nonetheless. 

Tozzini Freire has been advising us, and is doing an excellent job.  If you 
approve, we would like to continue to use them if litigation is necessary.   

Please call me or Randy with any comments or questions.

Thank you.

Jim,

Attached you will find the press release announcing the opening of our
Houston office, effective from January 1, 2001.  This is an important step
for the Firm and, in particular, the continued development of our oil, gas
and power practice.  Once the office formally is opened, we will look
forward to inviting you and others from the legal group over to meet the
people who will be resident in this office and have a look around, but for
the moment I just want you to know of this development as we announce it
publicly.  Please feel free at any time to let me know if you have any
questions.

Brad Keithley

I will keep in touch.

the time of the September 1st construction close have been given first 
consideration when selecting their new locker location before December 29th.  
 Priority will be given to member's original locker location (i.e. a member

space).  After this date lockers will be distributed to members on the 
waiting list and to member's with permanent lockers who request a different 
space from their original locker area.   For your convenience, a Body Shop 
enrolment and locker request table will be in the lobby from December 18th 
through January 5th between the hours of 11am - 1:30pm.

Rob, attached is the list of Legal VPs across Enron.  I have tried to get a 
confirmation from each of the Enron companies but have not been successful 
yet.    There are several employees such as Bob Vote, Robert Eickenroht and 
Chuck Cheek who are classified as Asst General Counsel which is a Sr Director 
job group and not VP.  

I am in training all day on Friday, Nov 10th and from 3-5 on Monday Nov 
13th.  I have HR PRC meeting on November 14th but I will be trying to keep up 
with e-mails and voice mails at night if you have any questions.

Lauren and Kelly:

I attach the consolidated legal comments to the  proposed Security and
Human Rights Principles, as well as  copies of your overview memo and of
the Principles themselves.

In summary, the note says we see no major issue legal that cause us to
advise Enron not to endorse the Principles, but that we do see a number of
significant matters that Enron should consider before it makes a decision
to endorse them.

There are two other items in addition to those mentioned in the note:

   In regards to e-mails we exchanged yesterday regarding the fact that
   these Principles are targeted at the extractive industry peer group that
   Enron tries to distinguish itself from and is largely exiting, I
   understand that Vicki will be contacting Kelly to discuss your
   suggestions  on differentiating Enron from those industries.
   It is not clear whether the decision to endorse the Principles must be
   made by the full Enron board or some level short of the Enron board.  I
   think Vicki will be discussing that with Rob.

Please call if you have any questions.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Direct
Enron Direct was recently cited by Ofgem for high complaint levels with 
regard to account complaints per total customers served.  Enron Direct views 
the Ofgem customer service measures very seriously and is committed to 
improving all aspects of its customer service - even while enjoying continued 
strong growth in its retail commodity business.   However, the account 
complaint level measure is particularly biased against fast-growing new 
entrants like Enron Direct.  Since all of Enron Direct's customers have 
recently switched suppliers - which is when most complaints occur - and our 
total customer base is far lower than that of the RECs, our account complaint 
levels per customer tend to appear inflated versus the REC peer group.   In 
fact, Enron Direct's complaint levels for both transfers (i.e., switchers) 
and mis-selling, as measured by Ofgem, were well below industry averages.  
While we are not yet best-in-class, Enron Direct's portrayal as an industry 
laggard in any aspect of customer service is misleading.  Stay tuned.

Relations with UPM-Kymmene
As previously announced, Enron Nordic Energy has entered into a two year 
energy portfolio management agreement with UPM-Kymmene, the forestry industry 
enterprise.  This deal creates huge potential for business opportunities 
across a wide range of areas for Enron.  

As part of the agreement, UPM-Kymmene has requested a dedicated account 
manager in Oslo.  In order to comply with this request, we have appointed 
Sami Tenngren on a full time basis to establish the operational framework and 
to coordinate all Enron relations with UPM-Kymmene regarding power related 
issues.

It is important that all Enron businesses take advantage of this unique 
opportunity to generate profitable business relations with UPM-Kymmene. If 
you would like to discuss new business opportunities related to worldwide 
power with UPM-Kymmene, please contact the Nordic Origination Team. Please 
also keep us informed about any other business development issues related to 
UPM-Kymmene within other parts of Enron.

Australia
The Sydney Metals Desk is now fully manned. Welcome to Owen Murphy,  Max 
Sobal and Robert Heynen to the Sydney Office.  The Metals Group is already 
reviewing the possibilities of utilising the existing metals customer base in 
Australia to expand these relationships to include power supply/pricing, a 
large component of overall costs.  While it is early days, our preliminary 
discussions on the idea of pricing for power in relation to metal price is 
receiving a positive response. 


ENRON IN THE PRESS

Virtual tanker swaps generate $5m freight in real terms
The inclusion of tanker swaps on Enron's online Internet trading platform in 
early October has already generated trade for 600,000 tonnes of tanker 
freight derivatives contracts worth the equivalent of $5m of freight in real 
terms - and all based on just one tanker route.

Volatility in the tanker physical sector prompted Enron to add tanker swaps 
to its new online platform.  Enron Director, Scott Moncrieff, told Lloyd's 
List: "The reason we started tanker forward freight agreements was because of 
the volatility.  We are experiencing the highest levels of volatility since 
the Gulf War."

Based on existing figures, the Enron team believes that growth in the 
physical market will fuel freight swaps demand.  Mr Moncrieff said: "The 
market for physical tanker freight will be over $10b in 2001.  This will 
obviously expose a lot of people to risk.  We want to give our customers as 
many options as possible so that it reflects their fleet."  Lloyds List

Enron lines up the big players
Enron is on line to introduce big players into the dry bulk freight 
derivatives market in the new year.

Enron's Pierre Aury, told Lloyd's List:  We are now meeting with banks and 
some have volunteered to trade on behalf of their shipping customers.  
Hopefully by early next year we should see the first trades with these new 
players."

After entering the shipping freight swaps market earlier this year, the 
EnronOnline initiative has generated plenty of business, and has, its 
creators hope, contributed towards liquidity in the other freight 
over-the-counter markets.

While Enron would like to see even more business come its way, surprise has 
been expressed at how quickly the online market has become established.

"We thought it would have taken longer to take off but we have reached close 
to 1.5m tonnes (dry bulk freight swaps) traded online.  Some days we are 
doing more than the over-the-counter markets.  Our dream target would be to 
double trade on the forward freight agreement market reasonably quickly," 
said Mr Aury. Lloyds List

Chance for competitive market.  Enron wants to trade with Polish energy.
"Experience from West European markets shows, that liberalisation leads to a 
decrease in energy prices for end-users, especially plants and companies.  
Competition and the TPA rule gives freedom of choice of contractor, and 
allows implementation of risk management tools.  It also allows potential 
investors to objectively evaluate analysed enterprises based on market 
research," said Jarek Astramowicz.  Parkeit (Polish national daily)

FLORA LONDON MARATHON 2001

Enron Europe has secured 10 places in the Flora London Marathon which takes 
place on the 22nd April 2001.  Places will be given to those who pledge the 
most money and give a non-refundable cheque (minimum o500) as a deposit.  The 
money can then be given to a charity of your choice.  Those who wish to apply 
should email adrian.watts@enron.com with their choice of charity and the 
amount they wish to pledge!  Entries and cheques should be in by Monday 18th 
December 2000.


GOT SOME LOOSE CHANGE?  TIME TO CLEAN OUT THOSE DESK DRAWERS. . .

You've all heard the reminders that we like to maintain a clean desk policy 
here at Enron House, but have we told you about the clean desk drawer policy, 
too?  Starting next week we plan to give everybody a fabulous opportunity to 
clean out their desk drawers and off load all those pesky pennies, francs, 
lira, escudos, pesetas, rupees, drachma, schillings, deutsch marks, dollars 
and any other foreign currency you have kicking around in your drawer into 
the two big blue bins in the Forum.  UNICEF and Enron have teamed up to give 
you a chance to make a fresh start in the New Year with a change-free 
drawer.  So, join in the fun and empty out those rattling desk drawers -- 
'cause we'll be calling a desk check come the end of January!  Oh, and yes, 
if you want to turn over a new leaf at home for the New Year, then gather up 
your loose change and drop it off in one of the bins on your way upstairs. 
The small print: All loose change will be collected by Travellex foreign 
currency exchange bureau for counting and, in the case of foreign currency, 
will be exchanged at market rates into pounds sterling.   The money will then 
be donated to UNICEF -- the United Nation's Childrens Fund -- to support, 
among other projects, their worldwide child care immunisation and clean water 
schemes.

Jim, I need to apologize and confess I skipped the call this morning because
of an uncontrollable addiction to the Presidential election proceedings. 
David Boies and Barry Richards were just too much to pass up.  Sorry.  
Not much here.  We settled the Beaver lease cases at the same price we paid
the other lessors and without any of their attorney fees.  Good result.  We
have FERC approval of the Sierra sale.  SEC looks good for Jan or Feb.  
I am working with Richard Sanders and Robin Gibb on defense to the California
class actions.  
We have a new offer from BNFL that will be the subject of a conference call
soon.  Looks like they will pay us about 75% of our damages to go away.  
One new risk is the upcoming cold spell and very high Northwest prices.  This
will cost us a lot of money, possibly not recoverable from customers, and may
spread the litigation over high prices to the Northwest.  This could develop
as a risk to the Sierra sale in the extreme, but right now appears manageble. 
More on this as it develops.  The Enron litigation team is here on Monday and
we will cooperate on strategy and resources as prudent.  
Finally, we have received a settlement offer on the Grant County case that
looks good and we are pursuing it.  Al.

Rebecca/Jim -

The India legal team has completed two important reviews:

Permits/Approvals Review.  Sandeep Katwala led a group reviewing our permits 
and approvals.  They feel pretty good about our compliance with these 
permits/approvals.  As you have heard on previous phone calls, the day tank 
seepage some time ago makes us the most nervous.  It seems to us that a 
release from the site resulting in substantial groundwater contamination 
plays pretty well in the court of public opinion given DPC's failure to "come 
forward" on the issue (even though it was advised at the time of the release 
that it had no legal obligation to do so).  Sandeep's note is below.

PPA Review.  Paul Kraske led a group reviewing the PPA.  His memo on this 
issue is also below.  He feels pretty good about our ongoing compliance with 
the PPA.  The instances of the non-compliance are not particularly material 
and none would appear to play well in the court of public opinion.  I should 
also note that it would be very difficult for MSEB to lawfully terminate the 
PPA -- that remedy is not readily available to MSEB under the PPA terms.

Both review efforts have relied somewhat on the representations of DPC 
personnel.  The India legal team was able to "tie down" many significant 
issues with written documentation but in many cases have relied on the oral 
representations of our own employees to confirm compliance with our 
obligations.

There are a number of other legal review efforts underway and I will keep you 
apprised as these reviews progress.

Bruce,
Lauren, Narayan and Kunal have completed their review of DPC compliance with 
clearances. Based on discussions with DPC personnel and a review of 
correspondence where relevant, no material non-compliance issues have 
surfaced which I feel would pose a problem under the PPA. There are two 
instances under the Reserve Bank of India approvals DPC has failed to submit 
reports to the Ministry of Finance within the time frame indicated; these are 
however minor issues. We have to accept that there may be practical instances 
where there may not be strict compliance at the site (eg the actual 
construction of physical assets is not strictly as per the layout approved by 
the authorities) but, from the discussions with DPC personnel none of these 
have come to light. On the environment approvals DPC has submitted compliance 
statements to the Maharashtra State Pollution Control Board which confirm 
that DPC is in compliance with the conditions in the relevant approvals. We 
have relied on these statements as being accurate. 

With respect to the water pollution issue, as we saw on Saturday, DPC has 
notified MPCB pursuant to the show cause notice of the measures taken to 
mitigate the pollution off the site. That correspondence seemed to indicate 
that there should be no further problems with this issue. However, my sense 
is that we have not seen the end of this issue and in particular, the report 
currently being prepared by GSDA has not yet surfaced in final form. There is 
no guarantee that it will be positive. Shobhan's view that it is difficult to 
see how a Court would support an injunction of some sort shutting down the 
plant "permanently" given the remedial measures taken by DPC is persuasive - 
you can however see that it provides excellent ammunition for PR purposes.

FYI.  Although clearly slanted, the following is rather astute local coverage 
of the issue.
John

Asia Intelligence Wire


MUMBAI, DEC. 5. Strange as it may sound, the Maharashtra State Electricity 
Board (MSEB) would be paying less for the energy it buys from the 
Enron-sponsored Dabhol Power Company if it buys more. If it buys only half of 
the present capacity, the state- owned power utility would pay, as it 
does now, around Rs. 95 crores per month towards unbought power. That is its 
entrapment signed and sealed with Enron. 

Under the contract between the MSEB and the Dabhol- based independent power 
producer, the pricing of its output has two components: capacity 
charges and the variable or fuel charge. If it buys power, it pays a 
combination of the two and if it does not, MSEB has to fork out the capacity 
charges 
which is almost a penalty for not picking up the energy.


At present, MSEB is allowed to buy only 3,044 million units which is about 
half the Dabhol plant's capacity during its currently operating Phase I 
because 
the Electricity Regulatory Commission has stipulated that only cheaply 
sourced power should be on its shopping list and if it has to draw from 
Dabhol, then 
the ceiling is 3,044 million units. 

That means, when the MSEB pays for half the power that would be available, it 
is also paying some Rs. 95 crores towards the capacity charges and which is 
loaded on what has been bought. This arithmetic has pushed the price, in 
addition to the weakened rupee against the US dollar plus the $30 per barrel 
of oil in 
the international market, to hover at close to Rs. 7 per unit. 

Arguably, it would have been cheaper to buy the entire output from the 
present Phase I capacity of 740 mw but the problem is that MSEB does not have 
money 
to pay for that. Therefore it would like to evaluate its options, as advised 
by the Maharashtra Government, so that the right ways and means could be 
found to 
handle this issue. 

One is to appeal to the MERC to allow all the power to be bought as it is 
produced, since the IPP is all set to activate a part of its Phase II 
capacity which is pegged 
at 1,444 MW and then get energy at a lower average price. That means it can 
avoid paying the capacity charges it can ill-afford. Says an official : "it 
is throwing 
good money behind the bad." 

Let us look at the prices paid hitherto, when the US currency had a different 
parity with the rupee. When it was Rs. 43.02 to a dollar, the MSEB was billed 
at Rs. 3.37 
per unit in May 1999. Then it was tossed upwards, to reach Rs. 6.81 now and 
next month, move to about Rs. 6.90 per unit. "If the rupee slides further, we 
pay more," 
an official explained. 

There is a nice little twist to the Enron story. If the Power Purchase 
Agreement, as re-negotiated by the Shiv Sena - BJP Government had not made 
the 1,444 mw 
Phase II mandatory as against only an option to either pick up or reject in 
the earlier PPA, this need a re-look at the Phase II or the entire project 
may not have arisen. 

Those in the know of the economics of the situation explain :"If it was an 
option, we could have taken a hard look at the experience with the Phase I 
and decided on 
our steps. But the millstone was tied around the MSEB neck in 1996 itself by 
the previous Government. There seems to be no escape route except to ask the 
IPP to 
lower its prices by managing its cost of funds." That is now being done. Some 
FIs like IDBI have offered to lower its interest rate provided the lowered 
burden is
 transferred to the MSEB in the tariff. This is yet to become a widespread 
offer from FIs but the MSEB may, with the Maharashtra Government's help, 
quietly lobby 
towards that objective. That would not mean a lot but in the payouts, a few 
paise per unit less. 

When the first block of Phase II is activated by June 2001, at present 
dollar-rupee parity, with the price of petroleum products being the same, the 
price of power 
from Dabhol is estimated at about Rs. 5.43 per unit but that too to a 
financially crippled power board is stiff. But it can do little because of 
the "take or pay" deal 
with Enron. 

If the petroleum prices remain steady and the rupee does not slide, and when 
the second block of Phase II is operational, the price of power could dip but 
"we 
are talking of a situation which we can guess at." This is on the basis that 
MSEB can buy all the power and not merely end up paying capacity charges for 
not 
buying energy. 

According to present estimates, outgo towards power bought and not bought, 
would be Rs. 511 crores per month June 2001 onward, Rs. 712 crores per month 
October 2001 onward when the current realisation for the MSEB is only Rs. 920 
crores per month from all power sold from all sources it accesses, its own 
and 
others. That is unlikely to go up substantially, not in the near future.

Joe:

I just returned to town and picked up your message re Enron General
Counsel's son and SMU. I am going to Washington early in the morning,
returning Wednesday evening.

I would be delighted to send a letter of recommendation to SMU Law School.
As a member of the School's Board of Visitors, I have had some success with
admissions, and would be happy try to help here. If he will send me a copy
of his college summary, I will prepare a letter and send it this week.

Hopefully, it will help. As you know, SMU is a long-time client, and Kay and
I, as well as the Firm, are significant money contributors to the School.

Regards.

supple that you can easily pack it, and so versatile you'll wear it=20

rigors of the road. That's why we stand confidently and fully behind=20
everything we make.=20

Airplane Comfort Kit
The airlines' idea of comfort just doesn't measure up: Scratchy,=20
handkerchief-size, shared-with-strangers blankets and tiny, lumpy=20
pillows are a recipe for jet lag. Next time you fly, pack your own=20
Airplane Comfort Kit instead. The cloud-soft fleece pillow unzips to=20
reveal a generous (36" x 60") double-faced fleece blanket that=20
surrounds you (and only you!) with heavenly softness and lightweight=20
warmth. There's even a thoughtfully placed pocket at the bottom in=20

your preferred level of firmness. Blanket and pillow cover can be=20
washed and dried by machine. Pillow also available separately. For=20
those desiring added lumbar support, the inflatable back pillow is a=20
great comfort add-on. $38=20

Men's Classic Packable Raincoat
These handsome raincoats have the superior quality and classic style=20
of those fashionable English macs. But they go one better by being=20
lightweight, packable, and 100% waterproof - ergo, a far better value=20
and the ideal raincoats for the road. (Most raincoats are not=20
actually rainproof!) Made of suede-soft microfiber, with a frankly=20
sensual texture, they weigh just 26 ounces. Best of all, each folds=20
into a compact travel pouch built into the lining. The travel pouch=20
slips easily into any carry-on. All styles are as impervious to=20
fashion trends as it is to rain and wind. Generous fit. $159=20

Medium Pack-It Envelope
These lightweight carriers are the answer to every frequent packer's=20
prayers. Not only do they organize your travel wardrobe by category=20
or function, Pack-It Envelopes prevent wrinkles by keeping clothing=20
from shifting around in transit. You'll even find you can pack more=20
in less space because the Pack-It compresses its load. Three colors=20
allow color-coded organization. Each Pack-It Envelope comes with a=20
folding board and instructions for quick and easy folding. The medium=20
size holds 8 to 12 dress shirts, blouses, or trousers. From Eagle=20
Creek. $25=20

Swiss Army Multi Tool
A screw falls out of your eyeglasses. A button pops off your pants.=20
The bike you rented needs a brake adjustment. From the people who=20
brought you Swiss Army knives, this Multi Tool corrects a multitude=20
of minor setbacks on the road and is compact enough to carry in your=20

airplane travel. Each year, millions of kids between the ages of=20

the departure gate.=20

? Get to the airport early. Parents or legal guardians should allot=20
time to fill out all paperwork required for unaccompanied minors,=20
most importantly the paperwork that travels with the child.=20

? Because in-flight food service can be slow or delayed, it's a=20

the flight.=20

? Parents or legal guardians should provide the airline with written=20
information about how flight delays or cancellations should be=20
handled, including emergency contacts and a means to pay for=20
necessities, such as overnight accommodations.=20

? Upon arrival at the destination point, airline personnel are=20
required to escort the child off the plane. They are not allowed to=20
turn the child over to a waiting parent or guardian without seeing=20
the adult's identification and matching it with the information on=20
the form filled out before departure.=20

? An authorized parent or guardian must pick the child up at the=20
arrival gate. Not only is it important for the child's sense of=20
security to be met personally at the arrival gate, but in some cases,=20
children will be turned over to local child welfare authorities if no=20

fyi--clearly, this was the "right thing to do."  But keep in mind that 
Transredes does not have a great credit rating.

Guys:

Just wanted to let you know that the Transredes board approved today to 
indemnify Enron for any legal expenses incurred in connection with the suit 
filed in Texas by Garner in exchange for a taking an active role in managing 
the litigation. The vote was 6 against one.

Fernando will be working together with Eileen and the gas pipeline guys in 
drafting the final agreement.

I guess this is good news for all the parties involved in this case.

Regards,

Miguel

Hi James:

My name is Pat Brandt and I work for the Legal Research Center ("LRC") in
Minneapolis.  As you may know, we are the nation's leading provider of
outsourced legal research and writing services.  Recently, we have entered
into a strategic business alliance with Integrity Interactive Corporation
("IIC"), to offer industry-leading, online compliance training - training
that could help Enron save millions in the event of a DOJ prosecution.
LRC's role in this alliance is to provide the legal research content for the
compliance courses and assist in the marketing and selling of the IIC
product.

You can view our compliance modules at work or home, as long as you have
access to the internet and a personal access code.  To receive an access
code or more information, please call (800-776-9377) or send me a reply
email.  Thank you for your time and have a great day!

Sincerely,

Patrick C. Brandt, Esq.

I'm having trouble accessing my email but here is the latest.  There are more 
newspaper articles which make me believe that GOM's position is hardening on 
reviewing the project.  I met with two of our outside lawyers today.  Atul 
recommended that we review the possibility of a challenge based on 
unconscionability or void as against public policy.  

The lawyers are universally pretty pessimistic regarding the possibility of a 
satisfactory outcome for Enron.

I'm meeting with the rest of our India lawyers tomorrow, including Robert 
Mathis.

As there are several new members of the Committee, I have been asked to
forward the following memorandum, which was sent to the membership on June
1, 2000 regarding the Committee's List Serve and how to use it. In addition
to this information, please note that the email address that you send the
message from must be the address that was given to the Committee (i.e. if
your business email address is on the List Serve, you cannot send a message
to the List Serve from your home email address), otherwise your message will
not transmit to the List Serve.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at (404) 249-2717
or at emily.ward@bellsouth.com.

MEMORANDUM


To:             Committee of Corporate General Counsel

From:           Thomas A. Decker

Date:           June 1, 2000

Re:             Committee's List Serve

One of the greatest benefits that we derive from being a member of the
Committee of Corporate General Counsel is the opportunity to communicate
with our peers and discuss matters common to us as General Counsel. The
Committee provides us with a forum to exchange ideas and experiences about
substantive, administrative and ethical law issues facing us and our
corporate clients. It also provides us opportunities for informal networking
among our peers.

In an effort to provide an additional avenue in which we may communicate, a
"List Serve" has been created for our Committee. A "List Serve" is an
Internet email device used to forward information to large numbers of
addresses at one time. The address for our Committee is corpgen@abanet.org.
All members of the Committee who have provided email addresses have been
placed in the "List Serve." To use the "List Serve," you simply address your
Internet email message to "corpgen@abanet.org" and your message will be sent
to all of the members.

The Executive Committee intends to use this device to communicate
information to the Committee regarding meetings and issues that effect the
Committee as a whole. Members are encouraged to use it to obtain information
and exchange ideas with other members of the Committee, such as
recommendations for outside counsel and networking for prospective hires. If
you wish to communicate to only a few members on the Committee, do not use
this device. Rather, send your message to the individual members, using
their e-mail addresses included on the Committee membership list. Also,
please note that if you choose the "reply all" button (versus the "sender
only" button), when responding to a message to this address, your reply will
not only go to the sender of the original message, but to the entire "List
Serve." (We have learned, from other Committees using a list serve, that
this can cause an abundance of mail to be forwarded to and from e-mail
systems which can overload some systems.)

If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact Emily N.
Ward at (404) 249-2717 or at emily.ward@bellsouth.com.

Rebecca:

These meetings that were set up with Pawar in Delhi were supposed to be
attended by Wade but but he was unable to attend them due to the fact that
he fell sick. No agreements have been reached because there are none that
are contemplated. All we have done is to encourage the GOM to approach the
GOI for reducing their own liabilities. The details you will find in the
other memo I have already sent to you. (I picked up your email after I
finished sending my emails).  The approach as u will notice is no different
than what we have been following all along and I believe that  you know
that already.  If u want further clarification, I am happy to discuss this
with you or if u want to follow a different strategy then please let me
know. I am at the Delhi Oberoi at  91-11-4363030, room 716.

Ken had expressed to me last week that you desired to take charge
immediately and start moving the resolution of the Dabhol issues forward. I
agree that this will be the best way forward. Given the way things are
moving, I think that it would be best  that you arrive in Delhi immediately
over the weekend so that I can introduce you to the players on Monday and
start transitioning the relationships to you and Wade. Wade will join the
team in delhi as soon as he is able to travel. Tuesday onwards I have
urgent commitments in Mumbai that require my presence there.

As you can appreciate, your presence in these meetings will be essential
for you to start getting a feel for the situation on the ground and
developing the rapport with the key players. The GOM is clearly driving the
train and if we are to assist them its essential that we not slow them down
and assist them in any way we can.

regards,

Sanjay

Sanjay,

Through several forwardings of memos it has come to my attention that you
had several meetings this week with Sharad Pawar and reached some
agreements.  I understand that a conference call to generate a strategy
regarding our approach to Mr Pawar was cancelled and no one is able to
explain to me what approach  you took or what the nature is of any
agreements or accomodations that you may have struck in these meetings.  I
think it is important that I and the rest of the task force be involved in
the setting of strategy even if we will call on you to conduct any of the
discussions and it is clear that it is cooperation and coordination is
paramount.

Please call or write immediately with a briefing of those meetings and of
any agreements that were agreed to.  In the future, I would appreciate
better coordination and discussions on all matter related to Dabhol and to
Metgas.  I am available by phone day or night.

Regards
Rebecca

Sandeep, 

Find out which firm Justin is discussing with. Hopefully, it is a "good" 
firm, both in terms of quality and absence of conflicts with what we've done 
in India to date. Let me know.

I hope Justin contacted someone in Enron legal with some experience in India 
before he hired a firm. Hopefully, he talked with you first, as this is 
common courtesy. Maybe he talked with Sarah G, and that would be fine also as 
she is generally aware of the Indian firms we use and don't use.

Thank you for your quick response!

As I suspected, I was slow on the draw.  Justin Boyd with our London team has 
already directed a firm in India to start looking at these issues.

I'll forward your email to Justin, as he very well may want to coordinate 
some of this through Sandeep, if Sandeep has the capacity to help us out.  

Thanks again for your help.

Subject: Clickpaper.com - Indian legal issues

Wade:

I hope things are going well for you.  It was good to see you the other day.  
I'm not even sure where you are right now, but I imagine that you are 
checking your e-mail, wherever you are.  I was hoping you could give us a 
little guidance on tracking down some Indian legal issues -- perhaps a 
reference to someone that could assist us.

Clickpaper.com is Enron's electronic  trading marketplace for pulp, paper and 
lumber products (including derivative products).  It is modeled after 
EnronOnline, but specializes in these commodities.  The team is in the 
process of registering customers around the world to access and trade on the 
Clickpaper website;  in keeping with the EOL business model, Clickpaper 
enters into access and trading agreements with every customer that govern 
their use of and trading on the site.

Those access and trading agreements are "jurisdiction specific" -- customized 
for the particular country in which the customer accessing the site is based 
-- in order to deal with jurisdiction-specific legal issues associated with 
accessing, or contracting via, the internet, financial trading, regulatory 
issues, etc.   

The team has identified India as having a large number of potential 
customers, and is attending a trade show in New Delhi in early December, and 
they would like to be able to sign customers up at that trade show, or at the 
very least arrange to give them access to the site.  We therefore need to 
consult with legal counsel in India to identify any issues and prepare an 
apporpriate access and trading agreement.  EnronOnline has developed a due 
diligence checklist which is very helpful in describing our business model 
and raising specific legal issues that we are likely to encounter.

Could you refer me to in-house counsel or an outside firm that could assist 
us with this project on an expedited basis (isn't that always the case 
here)?  I would really appreciate any help you could give to us.

To the other  recipients of this message  -- I know that there are several 
people working on this project -- if you already have this project underway, 
please let Wade and I know so we aren't duplicating  your efforts.  Thanks.

Rumors of Eni / Enron Merger Abound, Despite Denials from Eni
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
===============================================================

Eni, the Italian oil and gas group, is expected to complete the sale of
its Italian property interests next week as part of its strategy to focus
on its core activities of natural-gas and oil production. Vittorio Mincato,
Eni's chief executive, confirmed that the group is on the verge of
finalizing
the sale of its Immobiliare Metanopoli property subsidiary (Eni's real
estate company) with assets valued between $856 million and $1.3 billion.
Eni's decision to divest its property assets has been viewed by many
observers
of the company as an attempt to release funds to facilitate a merger with
another company. Enron Corp. has been among those on a rumored short list
of merger prospects for Eni.

ANALYSIS: Is the foundation being established for a mega-merger between
Eni and Enron? It is not too difficult to formulate a theoretical argument
in that direction.

Eni is Italy's state-owned, multi-faceted energy company, operating in
the oil and gas, power generation, petrochemicals, oilfield services, and
engineering industries. The company has a market capitalization of about
47 billion euros (approximately $40 billion), is present in over 70
countries
and produces more than one million barrels of oil equivalent a day. Across
the European energy market-which once it has fully privatized will represent

an arguably larger market than the United States-Eni is unquestionably
one of the Continent's leading champions.

Illustrating this point, Eni has taken several important steps within Europe

to, as it says, "play an increasingly important role" in the Continent's
competitive energy market. For instance, earlier this month, Eni inked
a deal to sell 2 billion cubic meters of natural gas to Gaz de France.
This deal followed a previous agreement in which Eni agreed to sell 4
billion
cubic meters of natural gas to Italy's largest private energy supplier,
Edison. With both agreements, Eni has given a substantial kick start to
the opening of the European natural-gas market. CEO Mincato has said that
Eni would recoup the losses made by giving up its market hold in Italy
by "focusing on international markets."

One move that Eni has made outside of Europe also came earlier this month.
Eni made a bid for Australia's Petroz NL, which wields an 8.25 percent
stake in Bayu-Undan, the giant gas and liquids project located off the
northern coast of Australia. Eni already owns 6.7 percent of Bayu-Undan
and apparently is attempting to gain a majority ownership over the project.
It is no wonder why-the Bayu-Undan field has recoverable reserves of 400
million barrels of liquefied petroleum gas and gas reserves of 3.4 trillion
cubic feet. Petroz has not yet accepted Eni's offer, but a favorable
decision
is expected shortly. Thus, whatever Eni may be divesting in Italy it is
trying to regain in other key areas of the world. In fact, Mincato recently
confirmed that Eni plans to increase its daily output of oil from a current
level of 1.2 million barrels to 1.5 million barrels by 2003.

Moreover, Eni has been making aggressive attempts at expansion, both within
Europe and beyond. Along with that expansion comes the development of merger

strategy. Eni does not want to be left as a target for a takeover, which
could be a strong possibility given its recent divestitures and the fact
that its profits remain strong. Net income for the company for the first
half of 2000 was 2,606 millions of euros (equivalent to approximately $2.2
billion), representing a 119-percent increase. Eni is largely considered
one of the best buys among the big oil stocks, but it would rather merge
with an equal partner than be sold to another company. As consolidation
of the oil industry continues, Eni reportedly believes that the only way
to remain a top player is to marry an equally large player on the world
stage.

Enron may be at the top of Eni's list of merger partners. Negotiations
with Spain's largest oil company, Repsol, appear to have stalled, as was
confirmed when Mincato stated that any "link-up with Repsol would not be
a merger of equals." French oil company TotalFina is also interested, but
is preoccupied with its own acquisition of fellow French oil company Elf.
Other companies that have been mentioned include Conoco and Phillips
Petroleum.
It is quite obvious that Eni's merger prospects are predominantly oil
companies,
which is quite clearly the company's intention. Thus, it may seem odd that
Enron is also included as a top prospect. Enron, while unquestionably a
world player, is known for its unorthodox approach to hard assets. Put
succinctly, Enron believes that it doesn't need to own physical assets
in order to be a major player, but rather it only needs to rely on strategic

contractual agreements.

However, if Eni wants to continue to expand globally, it arguably could
not find a better partner than Enron, generally considered North America's
biggest buyer and seller of electricity and natural gas. Enron's gas trading

and distribution activities in particular-along with its electricity
production,
raw material trading and broadband expansion-would all appear to be good
compliments to Eni's portfolio. Reports of talks between the two companies
first appeared in the Italian financial paper iL Sole 24 Ore, based on
input from an unnamed source. The report indicated that Enron is being
targeted by Eni for an equity partnership or even a full merger. Mincato,
as recently as Tuesday of this week, continues to adamantly deny that any
deal with Enron is being studied.

Not surprisingly, Enron is remaining mum on the rumors and has not even
mentioned Eni in any recent disclosures. However, the incorporation of
Eni's power production portfolio would support Enron's expansion into new
markets such as Japan, for example. Back in March, the Japanese government
began allowing non-utility firms to supply power to industrial and
commercial
end-users. Almost simultaneously, Enron established a new subsidiary, Enron
Japan Corp., to capitalize on new opportunities in the country. Enron
Japan's
first offer is a 10-percent discount off current electricity prices for
customers who sign on with Enron for two to four years. Operating against
its North American strategy, Enron also plans to build a power station
in northern Japan, beating to the punch several of its key rivals, including

Vivendi, Texaco and Royal Dutch Shell, which also have expressed interest
in establishing operations in the country.

Enron's proposed power plant should give the company prime access to
companies
in the Tohoku and Kanto regions, as well as Tokyo, the "big catch" of the
Japanese market. In my opinion, herein lies the primary synergy that would
make the partnership between Eni and Enron a strategic step for both
companies.
As Eni attempts to position itself in various key markets, Japan seems
like a natural location, and I've seen no reports that indicate Eni is
moving into Japan on its own. The fact that Enron is already there, along
with most other lucrative international markets, must certainly be appealing

to Eni. Regarding Enron's perspective on any potential partnering, Eni's
substantial oil and natural-gas generation assets, along with its current
lock on the European market, must be very attractive.

Enron's current market capitalization is about $48 billion, which actually
makes it larger than Eni. This raises the question of which company would
be the buying partner if a merger were to indeed take place. All of the
rumors flying around currently speak of Eni pursuing Enron, but it could
just as easily be the other way around. Those of us who follow Enron closely

may find it hard to believe that the powerhouse company would ever be the
target for a takeover or even a merger. In any case, the rumors continue
to fly as Eni responds to claims of "thou doth protest too much." Whether
or not any such merger between Eni and Enron, which appears smart on paper,
will materialize remains to be seen. However, it certainly seems like Eni
is lining up its chess pieces to cement some kind of partnership in the
very near future.

Jim,

The proposed structure chart I sent you a few days ago has changed following 
some comments received from lawyers and commercial people. I attach the new 
version. The changes are in groups 1 to 3 which have been rearranged, both in 
terms of work allocation and people.



I am also proposing, as part of the same exercise, to make 5 new assistant 
general counsels:

Mark Elliott
Robert Quick
Martin Rosell
Sarah Gregory
Marcus Von Bock .

Jim:  we need to hire counsel in Virginia to handle our license application 
with the PUC.  My experience in Washington was that the state was fairly 
parochial and did not generally look favorably to Virginia licensed attorneys 
from D.C. firms.  On that basis, I would like to engage a "Virginia" firm 
with good connections with the PUC.  I used to use McGuire Woods for Virginia 
litigation, but I don't know if they are on Enron's "approved" list, or if 
they have the expertise to handle a PUC application.  Do you have a 
recommendation?  Marc

Jeff/Ken:

I heard from Wade that there were a number of questions on Dabhol yesterday
and I thought it may help if u received a quick update. Over the last 3
days, I have met with most key players in GOI and GOM assisted by some very
close friends of ours. The start of the state assembly session has given
some politicians and some vested interests an opportunity to raise issues
about Dabhol in the assembly again, a feature that we have seen every year,
at about this time, without exception and has led to a number of misleading
newspaper reports. The usual suspects are behind the latest stirring of the
pot.

The facts however are as follows:

1. GOM (at the administrative and political level) and MSEB remain firmly
behind the project and the commitments to it. They are concerned but at the
same time looking at proactively working to find a solution. They also
believe that they may have found one that is agreeable to GOI.

2. After discussions with us on Tuesday, GOM and MSEB are working on a plan
(thru this weekend) to treat Dabhol as a national asset. The plan involves
MSEB selling  power from DPC to the central government utility which will
then pool the power with over 30,000 MW of power that they currently
control and sell the power onward to other states. The plan has already
been discussed at senior levels in the GOI and finds general acceptance.
Obviously the details are to be worked out and we are proceeding to help
GOM put the outline together over this weekend in Delhi and GOM will then
discuss it with MOP on Monday.

Wade reported that it was felt that the seniormost GOI ministers be
apprised  of the seriousness which with we are viewing this situation. This
was already done Tuesday.

3. The Indian Lenders to the Dabhol project have met and agreed to a 30 day
waiver of MSEB delay in payment - agreed subject to review of the situation
at the end of 6 months. They have also agreed to the Equity transfer -
subject to lenders counsel confirming that there are no legal issues under
any of the project contracts. This shows the lender support for continuing
to move forward and buys us time to put in place the fix we are planning.

4. Ministry of Power has yesterday agreed to support an effort to freeze
the duties on imported fuel at a lower level of about $12/bbl versus the
current $35 or so. This will help achieve an immediate reduction in tariff
from Phase I and make Dabhol more competitive. This proposal is currently
with Ministry of Finance and our expectation is that they will review it
favorably as the MOP is taking it up personally.

All signs that I have received in India over the last few days lead me to
believe that the GOM is committed to solving the Dabhol issues at the
earliest. While we all have concerns, they seem to be addressable and if
the current plan is successful, they can  be sorted out within the context
of current and existing documentation.

I have left names out but they are better discussed on the call that has
been scheduled for Monday evening India time. Hope that this helps in the
meantime.

Regards,

Sanjay

Committee members,

The Fall Meeting of the Corporate General Counsel is past, and from all
appearances it was a success.  It was good to meet many of you that
attended.  I wanted to take this opportunity to give you an update on some
initiatives Mr. Morgan is looking to implement and how we're going about
implementing  them.

The Committee's web site (see
http://www.abanet.org/buslaw/corpgen/home.html), as Mr. Morgan announced,
will be going through some modifications to enhance its usage.  The first
item to report is that the web site will be secured, in that it can only be
accessed by its members.  You will be asked to login with your ABA id
number, and also provide a password which is your last name.  Access to the
site will only be for current ABA members, who belong to both the Section
and the Corporate General Counsel Committee.

The second item to report is the posting of past and upcoming meeting
agendas.  You'll be able to see what was discussed at previous meetings, as
well as what is upcoming by clicking on the links.  Also to be included on
the site will be the materials that were distributed at your meetings.  Some
of the materials from the Fall Meeting have been posted and can be viewed at
the following link by clicking here:
http://www.abanet.org/buslaw/corpgen/fallmeeting2000.html

The third development to report is the implementation of a member profile
page and a foreign outside counsel searchable database, which I discuss in
length below.

COMMITTEE MEMBER PROFILES

The page will have all committee members listed, and will require the
submission of a photograph and a resume as follows:

*       Photographs -  A black and white or color photo should be submitted.
Photos should be no larger than 3 x 5 or 4 x 6.  Anything larger will not
scan properly for the web site.  You may also send a photo via e-mail (if
you have the capability), with the attachment consisting of your name, and
saved with an extension of .gif or .jpeg format (e.g. Charles Morgan
photo.gif or .jpeg).

*       Resumes - The easiest way to send these is via e-mail in either a
Word or WordPerfect format.

You can send these items to me at the following:

Fax: 312/988-5578

Mailing address (if sending any hard copies of photos)

Chicago, IL  60611


FOREIGN OUTSIDE COUNSEL SEARCHABLE DATABASE

Mr. Morgan solicited comments from members at the Fall Meeting regarding the
implementation of an on-line searchable database, consisting of foreign
counsel that committee members have used.  The purpose would be to take the
guess work out of contacting foreign counsel should the need arise.  The
database would be on the committee's web site with a link, and would have
searchable criteria like country, firm, expertise, clients represented etc.
The idea was received well with members present who attended the Fall
Meeting.

The only caveat to this is that the project needs to be approved by the ABA
Board of Governors.  In discussions with the Policy Office of the ABA, there
is a concern that this might imply an "endorsement" of sorts, and I was
advised to have Mr. Morgan submit this idea for approval by the Board.  We
will be taking the necessary steps to get the approval, with the hope that
we can move forward to implement.  You will be updated about the status of
the approval.



Please let me know if I can answer any questions for you.

Attached is a revised version of the Q&As, which incorporates many of the
changes suggested by Rob Walls, Jane Wilson and Paul Kraske. The new and
revised sections are shown in italics. (Please note that the second answer
indicates that Phase II is 80 percent complete, but the proposed
presentation to Sharad Pawar indicates 70 percent complete.  Confirmation
of the correct number would be appreciated.) Your early review, comments
and approval would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Jim:
Here are our comments on the i2 Technologies insurance policy.  This is a
combination of my comments and Marcia Backus' comments, and in fact Marcia
gets the vast bulk of the credit (I found out that she has considerable
experience in this area).
(1)  This is a claims made policy.  Apparently they are all this way.
Ken should get a contractual commitment from the Company to renew the
coverage upon its expiration or obtain new coverage that covers claims made
after expiration of the policy but relating to periods when Ken served on
the board.
(2)  We didn't attempt to determine whether the amounts of coverage are
adequate in light of the company's business or whether the carriers are
solid; I suspect Jim Bouillion has far more expertise on those issues than
we do.
(3) See item E on page 23 of 26.  It appears that the effect of the
language is that the $150,000 deductible applies if there's any case where
the Company is required or permitted by law to indemnify Ken but for some
reason (other than insolvency) it does not indemnify Ken.  This appears to
be a provision designed by the insurance company to ensure that the Company
doesn't say to Ken "Hey, you'll be fine and we'll come out ahead if you
agree that we won't indemnify you; you can just collect from the insurance
company with no deductible, and we'll be better off because if we indemnify
you we'll have a deductible."  This provision may make sense from an
insurance policy standpoint, but Ken ought to make sure he has a contractual
commitment from the Company to indemnify him to the fullest extent permitted
by law.
(4)  Please note exclusion 19 on page 22 of 26.  This provision is
designed to protect the insurance company by preventing the company from
making money by suing a director and then letting the director collect from
the insurance company.  Again, this points up that Ken needs a contractual
commitment from the Company to indemnify him to the fullest extent permitted
by law.
(5)  The application for the policy is part of the policy, which
apparently means that if there was something wrong with the application the
policy itself may be void, not only against the Company that applied for the
policy but also against innocent insureds such as Ken.
(6) The policy confers on the parent company the authority to cancel the
policy on behalf of the beneficiaries at any time.  Ken should get a
contractual commitment from the Company not to cancel the policy without
obtaining substitute coverage that is at least as good.
(7)   The policy provides insurance for employees as well as officers and
directors, which dilutes the coverage somewhat.
Generally, this appears to us to be an ok policy.  I would be very
interested in knowing whether Jim Bouillion disagrees with that assessment.

=DJ Enron, Powerex Investigated For Alberta Price Fixing
11/21/0 15:31 (New York)



      By Cheryl Devoe Kim
      Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

  TORONTO (Dow Jones)--Canada's Competition Bureau raided the offices of Enron
Canada Corp. in Calgary and Powerex Corp. in Vancouver earlier this year as
part of an investigation into suspected electricity price fixing by the two
companies, according to documents obtained by Dow Jones Newswires.
  Bureau investigator David Bloom alleges in an application for a warrant he
used to gain access to the offices that in the summer of 1999, Powerex and
Enron were coordinating bid restatements and inflating the price each received
for electricity as they traded on the Power Pool of Alberta.
  The investigation hasn't yet produced any charges against either of the
companies, according to Enron. The Competition Bureau declined to comment on
the status of the case.
  Both Enron Corp. (ENE), which owns Enron Canada, and Powerex, a unit of
provincially owned British Columbia Hydro & Power Authority (X.BCH), deny
breaking any rules or laws.
  From Powerex's point of view, Albertans are looking for someone to blame for
high power prices, which have become a political issue in the province.
  "They just find it easy to blame us for what are pretty fundamental market
design flaws," Powerex president and chief executive Ken Peterson told Dow
Jones Newswires in an interview.
   Deregulation Spurs Search For Someone To Blame
  The search for someone to blame has repeated itself across every 
deregulating
market Enron has participated in, Enron Corp. spokesman Mark Palmer said.
  "Almost every time that either power markets or natural gas markets or even
oil markets or gasoline markets have experienced any kind of price volatility,
there have been investigations done," Palmer said.
  Enron has been scrutinized before as part of wider energy markets
investigations, he said, but never found to be breaking the rules. This is the
first such investigation into Powerex's actions, Peterson said.
  The Competition Bureau, based in Ottawa, won't say whether the investigaion
is ongoing, citing disclosure rules under the Competition Act.
  The companies themselves said they're not sure of the investigation's 
status.
Their seized files were returned several months ago, but Powerex hasn't heard
from the Bureau since then. Enron did receive a call from the Bureau last week
with a question, according to Enron Corp. spokesman Eric Thode.
  The investigation began when the Power Pool of Alberta's system controllers
noticed the clearing price for a megawatt of electricity was topping C$100 
with
unusual frequency.
  The Pool's price is set by participants submitting bids to buy or sell power
for the following day. Until Oct. 19, 1999, a bidder could restate the amount
of power in a bid or offer an unlimited number of times, until 20 minutes
before the hour of transmission. The price paid for every megawatt of power
needed by the Pool in a given hour is set by the most expensive unit needed to
meet demand.
   Alleged Bid Rigging Methods Detailed
  According to the Competition Bureau search warrant application, Powerex and
Enron were rigging their bids in the following manner:
  Powerex would lower the volume of an existing offer. As little as two 
minutes
later, Enron would increase its offer for the same period by the same volume,
but at a "significantly higher price," according to the warrant application.
Sometimes, Enron would increase its offer even before Powerex had dropped its
offer.
  Power Pool market analyst Owen Craig, who once worked in Enron Canada's gas
trading group, found that "as a result of restatements, involving mostly
Powerex and Enron," the Pool price was raised once to C$200/MWh, four times to
between C$354.29 and C$499.93, three times to between C$500 and C$541.63, and
10 times to between C$801.02 and C$998.
  Based on the restatement patterns, Craig, and then the Bureau's Bloom,
concluded that no new energy was being offered to the Pool. They believed the
power was just being transferred from Powerex to Enron and then offered at the
higher price, according to the warrant application. By cutting the volume
offered by Powerex, the more expensive power offered by Enron would likely be
needed, and every participant would get the higher price.
  Powerex's Peterson doesn't take issue with the trade history as detailed by
the Bureau, but denies that the company's traders were doing anything wrong or
that the two companies had some sort of arrangement.
  "And we're adamant about that," Peterson said. "There was no deal with 
Enron.
There was no expectation about what their behavior would lead to in terms of a
change in prices or anything like that."
  Powerex traders were merely locking in their price, cutting the company's
risk, which Enron agreed to take on by buying the power at a fixed price,
Peterson said.
  "Whenever Enron's offer of high-priced energy was declined, within moments 
of
Enron being advised by the Pool that their energy would not be required,
Powerex would restate an identical volume of energy back into its lower priced
unit," according to the warrant application.
  Peterson's response: "We're operating in a very tight market there and we
felt an obligation to make sure the power got delivered into Alberta."
  Enron also denies it broke any Power Pool rules or Canadian laws.
  "It boils down to we were offered power at a price lower than we thought we
could sell it at," Enron's Thode said. "And that's what Enron and every other
company does that's in the business of trading."
  The May 25 search warrant covers the companies' actions between June 1, 
1999,
and Oct. 19, 1999. On Oct. 20, 1999, the Pool changed its restatement rules,
essentially closing the loophole, though it did so without ever making public
its investigation into Powerex and Enron.
  Power Pool spokesman Wayne St. Amour declined to discuss details of the
investigation.
  "Market surveillance is in place to, among other things, protect the
interests and activities of market participants," he said.
  Those convicted under Canadian law for bid-rigging can be fined an amount at
the court's discretion and/or jailed up to five years. A conviction wouldn't
likely affect Powerex's ability to trade in the U.S., Peterson said. In Canada
"there would have to have some follow-on action by the Alberta parties to
inhibit that. And so far, they still like to get our power."
  Companies Concerned About Reputations
  The bigger problem, Peterson said, is what the case will do to the Powerex
reputation.
  "Essentially both companies are concerned about it because we have a lot at
stake from a reputational point of view," Peterson said. "Both companies, I
believe, conduct themselves in the highest possible standard. But these are
difficult times in the business with prices going crazy in Alberta and
California and people looking for somebody to blame. There's always a
possibility of collateral damage when politics gets involved."
  Powerex parent company BC Hydro is also suspected by the Power Pool of
Alberta of unfairly providing access to transmission through British Columbia,
linking Washington with Alberta, as detailed in an Oct. 13 Power Pool market
surveillance report. Again, no charges have been laid.

Carrin & Jim --

It was an honor and a pleasure to meet both of you yesterday.  I know we will
have fun working together on this very special event.

Jeff left the jurisprudence luncheon lists for me before he left on vacation.
 I wasn't sure whether he transmitted them to you as well.  Would you please
advise me if you would like them sent to you?  I can email the MS Excel files

		 Subject: EECC Litigation Update - Puerto Rico, Marmara, Dabhol


I would like to update the legal report I just sent to you as follows:

   Puerto Rico:  Larry Izzo had a conference call with Misson Energy
   regarding the claims between EECC and EcoElectrica. Enron's shareholder
   representative was also involved.  The parties reached agreement in
   principle on the open issues (the owner dropped its claims against EECC,
   EECC relinquished two smaller claims, the Owner will pay EECC's
   remaining claims).  Bracewell's analysis of the claims was very helpful
   in reaching this result.
   Marmara: As expected, Black&Veatch has filed a formal notice of
   arbitration against EECC relative to sums they claim are due them with
   respect to the Marmara Project. EECC management expects that this will
   be settled early next year, and that it may provide an opportunity to
   reach a global settlement with Black & Veatch re Puerto Rico and
   potential future work.  Gail Brownfeld and Scott Burdine of Hagans, Bob,
   Burdine are both up to speed.
   Dabhol: Besix has informed us that we will be receiving thier notice of
   arbitration re the Dabhol Quarry before the end of the year. We are told
   that they have changed their counsel, apparently releasing the English
   firm of Masons and engaging a firm in Washington DC of Watts, Tieder,
   Hoffer & Fitzgerald to carry the claim forward. This is an unusual move,
   since the contract is governed by English law and the site of the
   arbitration will London. Besix's local representative told  our project
   manager that Besix was not happy with the Masons advice, but it may be
   that they want a US firm involved, backed up by an English firm. I have
   asked Phil Bruns to check into the reputation of  Watts, Teider. He was
   not familiar with them, but has found that it is a 67 lawyer firm that
   specializes in construction and real with a main office in northern
   Virginia and offices in California. Gail Brownfeld, Phil Bruns, and
   Jonathon Rosshandler are all aware of this development.

I offer the following in response to Mr. Baird's comments:

1. All D&O policies are written on a "claims made basis".    As noted in my 
earlier comments, I find no "retroactive date" in the policy.  If i2 renews 
with different   underwriters, the "retroactive date"  should remain the 
same.  If renewal is with the same underwriters, the date normally stays the 
same.  If they decide not to renew for whatever reason, they should, at a 
minimum, provide a runoff period or "tail" for the reporting of claims as a 
result of wrongful acts committed while the coverage was in effect.  I will 
leave the "contractual commitment to renew" to Mr. Lay and his attorneys.

2. As mentioned in my voice mail, the carriers are acceptable security.  We 
were not provided enough information on i2 to comment on the adequacy of the 
limit.  (We did note that Enron's program could apply as excess insurance if 
Mr. Lay is serving at the request of Enron.)

3. The indemnity provided by an organisation to their D's and O's is normally 
found in the Company by-laws.  If sued, the director or officer would first 
seek protection from the Company's indemnity.  If the indemnity does not 
respond, the claim is made directly against the insurance subject to the 
policy terms and conditions.  Most D&O matters are covered by the company's  
indemnity and the claim is subject to the deductible under the Corporate 
reimbursement section of the  D&O policy.  Normally the "direct coverage" has 
no deductible. 

4. The contractual matter should be handled by counsel.

5. It is normal in this type policy for the application to form a part of the 
policy.  "Polling"  the D's and O's at renewal will at least ensure that all 
claims are reported.  

6. See comment #1 above.

7. Employees are covered only when they are sued along with a director or 
officer, except for the  Employment Practices Coverage, where employees are 
covered along with directors and officers.

Please call if you or Mr. Baird wish to discuss further.

Subject: i2 Technologies


Jim:
Here are our comments on the i2 Technologies insurance policy.  This is a
combination of my comments and Marcia Backus' comments, and in fact Marcia
gets the vast bulk of the credit (I found out that she has considerable
experience in this area).
(1)  This is a claims made policy.  Apparently they are all this way.
Ken should get a contractual commitment from the Company to renew the
coverage upon its expiration or obtain new coverage that covers claims made
after expiration of the policy but relating to periods when Ken served on
the board.
(2)  We didn't attempt to determine whether the amounts of coverage are
adequate in light of the company's business or whether the carriers are
solid; I suspect Jim Bouillion has far more expertise on those issues than
we do.
(3) See item E on page 23 of 26.  It appears that the effect of the
language is that the $150,000 deductible applies if there's any case where
the Company is required or permitted by law to indemnify Ken but for some
reason (other than insolvency) it does not indemnify Ken.  This appears to
be a provision designed by the insurance company to ensure that the Company
doesn't say to Ken "Hey, you'll be fine and we'll come out ahead if you
agree that we won't indemnify you; you can just collect from the insurance
company with no deductible, and we'll be better off because if we indemnify
you we'll have a deductible."  This provision may make sense from an
insurance policy standpoint, but Ken ought to make sure he has a contractual
commitment from the Company to indemnify him to the fullest extent permitted
by law.
(4)  Please note exclusion 19 on page 22 of 26.  This provision is
designed to protect the insurance company by preventing the company from
making money by suing a director and then letting the director collect from
the insurance company.  Again, this points up that Ken needs a contractual
commitment from the Company to indemnify him to the fullest extent permitted
by law.
(5)  The application for the policy is part of the policy, which
apparently means that if there was something wrong with the application the
policy itself may be void, not only against the Company that applied for the
policy but also against innocent insureds such as Ken.
(6) The policy confers on the parent company the authority to cancel the
policy on behalf of the beneficiaries at any time.  Ken should get a
contractual commitment from the Company not to cancel the policy without
obtaining substitute coverage that is at least as good.
(7)   The policy provides insurance for employees as well as officers and
directors, which dilutes the coverage somewhat.
Generally, this appears to us to be an ok policy.  I would be very
interested in knowing whether Jim Bouillion disagrees with that assessment.
