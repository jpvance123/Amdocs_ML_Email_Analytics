I did not know about you and Kate. Congradlutions! My family is fine and I'm
happy to see your about to start one of your own. You probably heard this
once or twice in the last month but it's really only a job. Keep your head
up and if there is anything that comes to mind that I might be able to help
you with. The number is 011-44-207-827-2940 or home 011-44-207-586-0131.

Good Luck!

Harvey,
Thanks for the note. I really appreciate your concern. I hope all is
well in the European markets and you and your family are settling in
your new enviroment. Things are crazy here. You would not believe the
situation with ENE's credit situation. Nothing we could have ever
expected. Things are fine with me though. Kate (my fiance......I'm not
sure if you knew) is coming back to Portland and we are to spend some
time in December together. Tkae care and thanks again.
Regards,
Matt

We're beaming with excitement to share our new name with you!  It's a name that reflects the
true culture and beliefs of your Credit Union, and represents the reliable and innovative services
you expect and enjoy as a member.
  
 

Due to the unfortunate circumstances that surround Enron Corp., we believe it is important to change our name
for the sake of our membership and our organization.  Careful consideration went into choosing a name that we
feel describes our Credit Union's trustworthiness, shining service, and extensive product line that offers value
and convenience to each of our members. 

All of your Credit Union accounts remain unaffected, including your membership, loans and other account
services, as does our friendly staff.  Over the next few weeks, watch your mail and our web site (currently www.enronfcu.com) for information about our new web portal and e-mail addresses, as well as communications regarding your options to receive new ATM cards, VISA check cards, credit cards and checks.  

Give us a call with any questions at 713.853.6242, or drop us a note at efcu@enron.com.  Also, watch your mail for
information about our new location coming soon!  We look forward to sharing a bright future with each of you under our new name!

Dear Matthew,

	
There you are, relaxing on a white-sand beach. In front of you, the cerulean-blue sea stretches out for miles ... behind you, palms are swishing softly in a gentle breeze ... and beside you, that special someone and a tall, cool tropical drink. Paradise? No, it's the Caribbean! Jamaica, the Bahamas, Aruba, and more -- and they're all on sale right now, for up to 35% off <http://www.expedia.com/pub/agent.dll?qscr=cmdi&dsct=1&dnam=Caribbean&rfrr=-6490>. 

	  <http://www.expedia.com/daily/common/images/spaceit.gif>	Can you picture yourself here? <http://www.expedia.com/pub/agent.dll?qscr=cmdi&dsct=1&dnam=Caribbean&rfrr=-6384>

DON HENLEY AND TRAIN
TO HEADLINE TIGER JAM V 
PRESENTED BY COCA-COLA 
AT MANDALAY BAY IN LAS VEGAS
SATURDAY, APRIL 20th 


Los Angeles, CA (March 4, 2002)-The Tiger Woods Foundation announced
today that Grammy-award winning artists Don Henley and Train will
perform at the Tiger Jam V benefit concert presented by Coca-Cola and
hosted by Tiger Woods.  The fifth annual event will take place on April
20, 2002, at 8:30 PM in the Mandalay Bay Events Center in Las Vegas,
Nev.  The benefit concert will once again raise and distribute funds for
the Tiger Woods Foundation and children's charities based in Las Vegas
and Los Angeles.  

"I am very excited to have both Don Henley and Train as part of Tiger
Jam V," stated Tiger Woods.  "I have been a fan of Don's for a long
time, and Train is a band whose sound I really love.  I'm looking
forward to seeing both of their performances and I know they will help
make Tiger Jam V a memorable evening."

Tickets for the concert will be going on sale to the general public
beginning Sunday, March 10, 2002, and can be purchased through
Ticketmaster Charge-By-Phone lines at (702) 474-4000, at all
Ticketmaster retail ticket centers, via www.ticketmaster.com, and at the
Mandalay Bay Box Office. Individual ticket prices start at $45.  VIP
events will be held before and following the concert - packages begin at
$1,500.

An ardent supporter of the Walden Woods project, which has raised over
30 million dollars to preserve Walden Pond and support the Thoreau
Institute, Don Henley has had a long and successful music career.  As a
founding member of the Eagles, Henley won four Grammy awards, topped the
album charts five times and has been inducted into the Rock and Roll
Hall of Fame.  Henley's first three solo efforts produced numerous hits,
including "Dirty Laundry", "All She Wants to do is Dance," and "The
Heart of the Matter," as well as a Grammy award for Best Rock Vocals.  

"Drops Of Jupiter," the title track from Train's multi-platinum second
album, recently won two trophies--Best Rock Song and Best Instrumental
Arrangement Accompanying Vocalist(s)--at the 2002 Grammy Awards
ceremony. The San Francisco-based Train has earned a reputation as one
of the hottest live bands in the country having performed hundreds of
gigs--including slots on the Matchbox Twenty tour and high-profile
television performances on "The Late Show with David Letterman," "The
Tonight Show with Jay Leno," the 2002 Grammys and the 2002 Winter
Olympics--since the release of the group's self-titled debut album in
February 1998.  Driven in part by the band's breakthrough single, the
Top Ten hit "Meet Virginia," the band's self-titled first album was
certified platinum in March 2000.

Proceeds from Tiger Jam V will be used to support the many programs
funded throughout the year by the Tiger Woods Foundation.  Charities
that received funding from Tiger Jam IV include Child Haven, Center for
Independent Living, Greater Las Vegas Inner City Games, Las Vegas
Chamber of Commerce Foundation, Southern Nevada Inner City Youth Golf
Association, Las Vegas Founders' Club Golf Foundation, Children of the
Night, Starlight Children's Foundation, GRAMMY in the Schools and VH1
Save the Music Foundation.

Established in 1996 by Tiger Woods and his father Earl, the Tiger Woods
Foundation empowers young people to reach their highest potential by
initiating and supporting community-based programs that promote the
health, education and welfare of all of America's children.  Through
junior golf clinics, motivational speeches, educational programs, the
support of local heroes and benevolent giving, the Foundation has
interacted with over 85,000 kids across America.

The Coca-Cola Company is the official community sponsor and beverage
sponsor of the Tiger Woods Foundation, and the title sponsor of two
major annual fundraising activities- the Tiger Jam benefit concert, and
the series of Coca-Cola/Tiger Woods Foundation Junior Golf Clinics.

The four-star Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino celebrates its third
anniversary this Spring, continuing its tradition of elegance and
excitement as one of the top resorts on the Las Vegas Strip. Well known
for its diverse array of top entertainment offerings, the Mandalay Bay
Events Center regularly plays host to a wide range of events, including
concerts by opera sensations the Three Tenors and Andrea Bocelli,
popular music stars Ricky Martin and Gloria Estefan, and has become the
premiere venue of choice for world championship boxing events. Tiger Jam
V on April 20th marks the third time Mandalay Bay plays host to Tiger
Jam.

For more information on the concert, TWF or for Tiger Jam V Sponsorship
opportunities, please call Michelle Bemis at (714) 816-1806.

Nothing about bankruptcy is easy, and because of Enron's size, ours is especially complex.  So it is understandable that there might be confusion among employees of Enron's various debtor and non-debtor companies surrounding the bankruptcy.

To clarify, debtor-in-possession, or debtor, companies are the legal entities of Enron that have filed for bankruptcy - their business activities are subject to the review and approval of the Creditors' Committee and the bankruptcy court.  Non-debtor companies are legal entities owned or controlled by Enron that have not filed for bankruptcy - for the most part, non-debtor companies are able to operate their business as usual.  The estate is made up of the combined assets and liabilities of Enron, which include some holdings in non-debtor companies.  It is important to note that at the beginning of March there were approximately 20,000 Enron employees in non-debtor companies, and about 3,500 Enron employees in debtor companies.

Distinctions between debtor and non-debtor companies become especially relevant for employees as we begin to roll out components of a transitional compensation program.  As we work through restructuring, components of the program will apply differently to employees of debtor and non-debtor companies.  For example, earlier this year some non-debtor companies were able to pay performance bonuses and merit increases to their employees as part of the ordinary course of business.

Another example is severance.  Going forward, we can anticipate gradual reductions in our workforce.  Given the uncertainty of our situation, we realize the importance of providing a "safety net."  Severance provides employees a degree of financial security in the event their jobs are terminated in the future.  Some non-debtor companies were able to recently institute a new severance plan for their employees.  This was possible because the plan did not require the approval of the bankruptcy court.  While the severance plan for debtor companies will be different than the plan for non-debtor companies, severance is part of a comprehensive retention and severance plan that will go to the bankruptcy court for approval.  Employees of debtor companies will be covered by either severance or retention.

Retention will become part of the compensation program for some employees, primarily those in debtor companies.  Retention offers employees an incentive to stay with the company to help develop a new business entity, to liquidate non-core assets, or to unwind the affairs of the estate.  Retention is not a measure of past performance, but is intended to retain key employees whose skills or historical knowledge are critical to preserve or generate the greatest value for the estate and its creditors.

Additionally, we are now finalizing merit increases and promotions for employees of debtor companies.  Supervisors in those companies will soon begin communicating merit increases or promotions to their employees.

We hope this information further clarifies the bankruptcy's impact on our individual businesses, but more importantly, we hope it helps to establish realistic expectations and reduce some uncertainty for you as employees.

From: Governor's Office of Emergency Services

WHAT: This weekend, the Governor's Office of Emergency Services, in
coordination with its Sacramento Urban Search & Rescue Task Force #7,
will test 18 Urban Search & Rescue canines. During the Disaster
Search Canine Readiness Evaluation, each canine will undergo a
rigorous 1 ? hour test rescuing mock victims from rubble piles of
various configurations. 

WHO: Eleven US&R canines from various parts of California, seven from
other states and one from Canada. Some of the canines are being
tested for the first time, others are being recertified as required
every two years, but most are being tested for a promotion.

WHEN:Eight dogs will be tested each day on rotation. Saturday and

Great restaurants, shopping, historical attractions, and more. Take a Fan Fare trip from delta.com and explore a city you might not otherwise visit. Whether you're interested in immersing yourself in nature on the slopes, the arts, or history, Salt Lake City is the perfect destination this weekend. Here are a couple of ideas to get you started.

Ballet West
Ballet West ranks among the premier professional ballet companies in the United States. The company strives to bring new levels of excellence to ballet through innovative choreography, and to present balanced programs representing a broad range of ballet styles. This weekend you can experience two company premieres, Christopher Bruce's Ghost Dances and Hans van Manen's Black Cake. Concluding the program is George Balanchine's tribute to the great composer Igor Stravinsky, Stravinsky Violin Concerto. Located at Capitol Theatre, 50 West 200 South, Salt Lake City.

Temple Square
No trip to Salt Lake City is complete without a long visit to the square that forms the heart of Salt Lake City. You'll find the Family History Library, the Tabernacle, home of the world-famous Mormon Tabernacle Choir, as well as the Temple that gives the square its name. Free tours begin every 5 or 10 minutes at the 100-foot flagpole in the center of this 10-acre block.	   <http://www.delta.com/images/spacer.gif>

Dear Expedia.com Customer:
                                                                                                     
We have received notice from CONTINENTAL AIRLINES that they have made a change to your flight schedule.         
This change could mean a difference in departure or arrival time and/or a change in flight number on one
or more of your flight segments.                          
                                                                                                                   
To review your new flight information online, access your itinerary by clicking on the following 
link. http://expedia.com/pub/agent.dll?qscr=litn

If you are traveling with an e-ticket, you must provide proof of current date travel, such as a printed

recommend that you check your itinerary on-line prior to your scheduled departure to ensure that the 
information that is displayed on your printed documents has not changed.

EA Estate Group:

Please see the below reference of Enron's vacation eligibility, allowance, and scheduling policy:

Vacation Eligibility:
All regular full-time employees are eligible for vacation based on continuous service.  Regular part-time employees receive 40 hours per year of paid vacation per year.  Temporary employees are not eligible for vacation.

Vacation Allowance:
Vacation allowance is based on an employee's continuous service according to the following schedule.  Employees must be on the payroll and actively at work as of the first business day of the calendar month to accrue vacation for that month.  If the first day of the month falls on a holiday or weekend, causing the employee to have a hire date other than the first, the vacation accrual date will be dated the first of the month so that the employee will accrue vacation for the month.  (For example, an employee with a hire date of January 5, 1998 will have a vacation accrual date of January 1, 1998.  The intent of this change is only to affect the vacation accrual date as explained; it is not to affect any other term, condition, privilege, or benefit of employment.)

Length of Continuous Service--Vacation Allowed
>From hire date to the end of the calendar year in which the employee was hired -- Prorated accrual of 10 hours per month for each full calendar month completed.
For an employee hired in a prior calendar year who has less than 10 years of service -- 3 weeks (120 hours) per year
For an employee with at least 10 but less than 20 years of service -- 4 weeks (160 hours) per year
For an employee with at least 20 years of service -- 5 weeks (200 hours) per year
Vacation may be taken any time in the calendar year in which the employee will complete required service for 3 weeks, 4 weeks, or 5 weeks of vacation, per the schedule above, except for the hire year.

Vacation Scheduling and Approval:
Supervisors- The supervisor will develop a vacation schedule that ensures all essential operations are maintained effectively.  All vacation requests are subject to Supervisor approval.  

Tthe Estate will continue to implement its current policy with respect to the payment of unused vacation under most circumstances.  Any questions regarding this policy should be addressed to Khymberly Booth @ X52532.

Thanks-
ENA Human Resources

Brian,
Hi. Hope things are well with you. I wanted to drop a line and say hello as well as to thank you for your extreme generosity   with respect to our wedding. I am humbled by what you are doing for us and know Kate feels the same. I am looking forward to September and know that all will have a great time!
Kate and I are going to CT and NY next week to find a place to live (hopefully). We are planning on renting initially then look to buy later. Real estate is crazy there. I guess it is not much better where you are though. Take care.
Regards,
Matt

As many of you know, we have been working with members of the Creditors' Committee and their consultants since December to formulate a Retention & Severance Plan, and we formally presented the plan to the committee on Friday, February 22.  We had hoped the committee would approve the plan quickly so that we could file it with the bankruptcy court and share the details of the plan with you before the end of the month.
 
We know that many of you have career options outside of Enron and that the Retention & Severance Plan may impact your decision to stay or to leave.  We sincerely regret to inform you that approval of the plan for debtor companies is delayed.  We're learning that, in bankruptcy, most things don't move as quickly as we are accustomed.
 
The committee outlined some concerns related to our proposed plan, but we are confident we will be able to reach agreement with the creditors on those concerns.  The Creditors' Committee fully supports the implementation of a Retention & Severance Plan.  Such plans align the company's objectives with the goals of the creditors and are fairly standard in bankruptcy.  These plans are designed as a way to preserve and maximize value for the estate.
 
The Creditors' Committee also understands that time is of the essence for getting a plan in place and has established a subcommittee to expedite their review and approval process.  To that end, we are meeting regularly with the subcommittee.  We intend to work hand-in-hand with them to reach agreement on an acceptable plan as quickly as possible.  This is currently our top priority, bar none!
 
When we filed for bankruptcy, we did not fully grasp how tedious the process of developing an acceptable plan would be.  Unfortunately, that lack of understanding led management to set unrealistic expectations about how quickly a plan might be in place.
 
We now know that it takes significant time, resources and effort to understand, identify and gather the massive volume of required details, to formulate that information into a reasonable program, and to prepare a rationale and compelling presentation.  The process mirrors the most time-intensive business presentation or deal negotiation with which Enron has been involved.  That serves only as an explanation - it is not intended as an excuse.
 
We remain committed to working with the Creditors' Committee until we can reach agreement on a plan.  We anticipate that negotiation process will take another week or so, and have targeted the week of March 11 to file a motion to adopt a plan with the bankruptcy court.  We will continue to hold retention and severance as our number one priority until a plan is approved by the bankruptcy court.
 
With respect to non-debtor companies, or those companies not in bankruptcy, new severance plans are being approved and will be rolled out to employees in those companies in the very near future.
 
In the meantime, we have been working to finalize merit increases and promotions across the entire organization and plan to communicate those to employees next week.
 
And of course, we will update you on retention and severance as soon as possible.

While it has been discouraging to see an endless stream of negative news coverage about Enron, we want you to know about some positive news that is starting to emerge.  ABC News was at Enron today because they want to do a story about Enron's future, our business going forward and the tremendous work being performed by the remaining 20,000 employees worldwide.  The segment is scheduled to appear on both Good Morning America and on ABC World News Tonight with Peter Jennings on Wednesday, Feb. 20.  The Good Morning America piece will be kicked off with a live feed from the Enron Building tomorrow morning at 7 a.m. CST.   Check local listings for the air time of World News Tonight.  While there is no guarantee that these stories will be glowing pieces about Enron, the interest by ABC in running a positive story is encouraging.  We wanted to let you know about these stories before they air.  

Additionally, two articles featuring interviews with Interim CEO Steve Cooper ran yesterday in USA Today and the Los Angeles Times.  We are forwarding them to you for your information.  Thank you for your support as we work to turn the tide of media coverage and public perception of Enron and its employees.


MONEY
New Enron CEO turns company focus to future ; While workers cope with loss and uncertainty
Noelle Knox

USA Today
FINAL
B.03
(Copyright 2002)

HOUSTON -- Inside Enron headquarters, employees walk by stacks of moving boxes as they scrounge for pens and Post-it Notes from the empty desks of their laid-off co-workers. On one desk, an employee finds a note that reads: "I'm not gone, don't take my stuff!" 
Forgotten behind the headlines of smoking guns, Aspen ski homes and shredded documents are almost 18,000 employees who work on Enron's power plants and pipelines.
USA TODAY is the first to get a tour inside Enron since its collapse late last year and spend time with Stephen Cooper, the new chief executive, talking about his vision for the future. 
On the 50th floor of executive suites, decorated with rich carpets and velvet-covered chairs, there is a sweeping view of Houston -- a city Enron helped shape with its philanthropy, political donations and corporate muscle. Cooper, however, is only focused on saving part of the company. 
His plan faces monumental challenges. In his words, "Everybody's betting against us." 
While many American corporate icons have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the past year -- Kmart, Polaroid, Bethlehem Steel -- the size, speed and sordid details of Enron's collapse have sparked numerous investigations and lawsuits, angered creditors, demoralized employees and ruined its reputation. 
But Cooper -- whose firm Zolfo Cooper worked on the troubles of such companies as Polaroid, Sunbeam and Federated Department Stores - - is adamant Enron can emerge healthy from bankruptcy within a year. 
"I've probably been in more Chapter 11s than anybody in the United States, literally," he says. "This company, by way of business and asset base, by way of management team, by way of predictability of its future business, has more of all of that than most distressed businesses I've ever seen." 
Cooper's plans 
The company already has sold the energy-trading business that was once considered its crown jewel to UBS Warburg. Although a bankruptcy court and Enron's creditors must first approve any moves, Cooper's plans include: 
* Enron will likely have to give up this skyscraper for a "more modest habitat," Cooper says. 
* The company's new $100 million building across the street from headquarters also is for sale. 
* Even Enron's name blazoned across the top of the nearby Major League Baseball stadium is going to have to go. 
"Out of the ashes, there ought to be something everyone can be proud of a year, or two, or three from now," he says. 
Today, the company still has a pipeline network that stretches from Canada to California and from Texas to Florida. And Cooper is betting that business can power the light at the end of the tunnel. 
He wants to keep the North American and South American pipelines and power plants and sell or shut down the rest of the company's businesses, including its broadband network, water utilities and the like. 
That will mean cutting an additional 10% to 20% off Enron's payroll and returning the company to its natural gas pipeline roots of the 1980s. 
But to pull off his plan, Cooper must not only sway his critics, including giant Wall Street creditors, but also motivate thousands of devastated employees. 
"Cooper and (Enron President Jeff) McMahon have one of the toughest jobs in business to keep the people there and keep them motivated," says John Whitney, a turnaround expert and professor at Columbia University. 
To lock in 500 key executives, Enron offered $55 million in retention bonuses. Former Enron executives who went to UBS Warburg as part of the sale of the energy-trading business also pocketed multimillion-dollar payoffs. 
And Cooper's pay? 
The New York-based consulting firm Zolfo Cooper will receive $1.3 million a year, plus $1.2 million for each of the eight executives he brought with him to Houston. If Enron emerges from bankruptcy, Cooper's firm will get a $5 million fee. If Enron is liquidated, Cooper will get a fee agreed upon by the creditors and court, according to a filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York. 
Shattered morale 
Enron's fall from grace has shattered employee morale. 
"It's just so sad," says one current employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "On several floors, it looks like the rapture. It looks like people disappeared into space. They're just gone." 
This employee, just two years away from retirement, watched $160,000 in retirement savings shrink to zero with Enron's stock price. "Now I'm going to have to work as a greeter at Wal-Mart until I'm 90," the employee says. "It's gone. I just can't make it back." 
Jorge Garcia, a project controls manager laid off in December, says his friends still at Enron say, " 'You can tell if you'll be let go soon by your office accommodations. If you've been moved to a cubicle, you probably won't last long.' " 
That kind of stress takes its toll. 
Downstairs in the company gym, Kathy Kissner, a massage therapist, says that as the company fell apart, employees would call begging for any open appointment or even just five minutes between appointments. 
"I've lost 30 pounds in the last six months" from long hours and lack of sleep, says Mark Palmer, vice president of communications. 
Cooper knows his employees have been hurt financially and emotionally. It's the hardest part of his job. 
"When people are looking at the prospect of losing enormous amounts of money, they often times get heated. They get emotional and upset," he says. "It's never fun to be at the receiving end, but I've gotten used to it." 
Blast voice mail 
To motivate the employees, he is trying to focus them on future goals. "People have two choices: We can spend all of our time living in the past, which is a crazy way to spend your life. You can't change it. Or, we can begin to move beyond the disappointment and the upset and the loss, to focus on the future," he says. 
And he has opened up lines of communication. 
Once a week, he sends out a lengthy voice mail, telling employees what has happened during the past week, explaining management changes and timetables. 
When employees call or send him e-mail, he will go find them in the building to answer their questions. And next month, he will hold a meeting with all of the employees in Houston to explain the details of his strategy to bring the company out of bankruptcy. 
This kind of candid communication is essential, he says. 
"We are not trying to eliminate bad news. We are not trying to make it just good news. What we are trying to do is to eliminate uncertainty," he says. "People can live with either one of those, good or bad. What they can't live with is uncertainty." 
And while some still say Enron's future is uncertain, Cooper is certain of one thing: 
"The lives and reputations of 20,000 people shouldn't be trash- canned because a handful of geniuses decided to run wild," he says. "People ought to keep in perspective that we've got a lot of really tremendous people here, and for the sake of a couple bad apples, we shouldn't blowtorch the entire field."

The Nation Acting CEO Plans Legal Assault Amid Effort to Salvage Enron Litigation: Those who helped fell the energy giant would be targeted, Stephen Cooper says.

HOUSTON -- Enron Corp. is planning a broad legal assault against those who helped bring the company down, according to acting Chief Executive Stephen Cooper, the corporate rescue artist who was selected three weeks ago to put the company back on the road to solvency. 
Cooper said in an interview that the litigation would be extensive and rapid, although he declined to identify specific targets.
"Enron may have causes of action against institutions and individuals that could represent a meaningful asset for the estate," said Cooper, a principal with Zolfo Cooper, a New York consulting firm that specializes in corporate restructuring. "I think you will see something sooner as opposed to later." 
The players were many in what has become a lurid corporate morality play, and all are potential defendants. 
Enron filed the largest Chapter 11 bankruptcy in U.S. history Dec. 2, following a series of damaging disclosures of questionable transactions with partnerships controlled by company employees. The nation's seventh-largest company collapsed less than seven weeks after it disclosed losses tied to the off-the-books partnerships, wiping out billions of dollars in investor wealth and more than 6,000 jobs. 
An internal investigation by three Enron directors determined that abuses in accounting of partnership transactions masked at least $1 billion in recent losses, while a few company employees reaped millions of dollars in personal profits. Directors and executives, including former Chairman Kenneth L. Lay and former Chief Executive Jeffrey K. Skilling, failed to curb the missteps of subordinates, the report concluded. It also pointed to poor advice from Andersen, Enron's auditor, and Vinson & Elkins, one of its outside law firms. 
Still Sorting Out All the Issues 
Cooper, who occupies Skilling's old office on the 50th floor of Enron's mirrored office tower in downtown Houston, said the company has not asked any former employees to repay the millions of dollars they earned from partnership transactions. That would include former Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow, former Enron Global Finance executive Michael Kopper and former Treasurer Ben F. Glisan. 
"I think that the recovery vehicle in the main will be litigation," Cooper said. 
Cooper and his team are still "sorting out issues" related to Enron's financial statements and the value of its trading book, the contracts that were not included in the recent sale of its energy trading operation. Since Enron filed for Bankruptcy Court protection, the value of those contracts has eroded to about $1 billion from about $7 billion. 
"I certainly don't believe at this particular point in time that anybody is engaging in transactions that aren't completely above board," Cooper said. "We will be presenting to the creditors committee on a regular basis our financial statements, which I believe, in the main, will be accurate." Enron has not yet hired a new auditor to replace Andersen, which it fired. 
Enron already has filed a $10-billion lawsuit against Dynegy Inc. alleging that its cross-town rival withdrew from a proposed merger with Enron in late November as part of a plan to wreck the ailing company. Dynegy has said it pulled out of the merger because Enron misrepresented the depths of its financial problems and lost its investment-grade credit rating. 
The Enron that Cooper envisions will look much different from the market-dominating energy trader that Lay and Skilling built. The name will change, and the company will focus on its natural gas pipelines and power plants--the kind of hard assets Skilling said he disdained. 
Cooper's style, too, is unlike Lay's grandfatherly and professorial demeanor and Skilling's hard-driving image. Cooper insists on being called by his first name and dresses casually at the office, complete with baseball cap. He hasn't decorated Skilling's wood-paneled, deadbolted office. 
To keep up employee morale, Cooper said he visits workers in response to e-mail and sends out weekly, unscripted voicemail updates. An all-employee meeting will be held soon, he said. 
Enron's overhaul is well underway. 
Enron has agreed reluctantly to turn over to Dynegy its biggest pipeline, 16,500-mile Northern Natural Gas, which was a condition of the $1.5 billion that Dynegy invested in Enron as part of the aborted merger. Enron also recently gave away its vaunted energy-trading operation to New York investment banking firm UBS Warburg in a no-cash deal that would supply Enron with a cut of any future profit. 
What remains is an assortment of smaller natural gas pipelines, including one that runs from Texas to California, and electricity generating plants. Enron has announced plans to shut down its remaining telecommunications operations and to unload Portland General, its Oregon utility, as well as many of the international power plants and other assets whose poor performance helped sink the company. 
Cooper declined to detail which assets he is thinking of unloading because "we haven't settled on a final configuration yet. But it will be substantially smaller by way of reported revenue than the old Enron. 
"The company, if you remove the trading from the rest of the business, it's actually got a very good, very solid, very revenue- and cash-flow- and earnings-predictable business, which is really its power and pipes business," Cooper said. "So in my view, there is an eminently reorganizable entity here." 
'Not Going to Wallow and Linger' 
Cooper expects to present "a fairly on-point direction" for reorganization to its creditors committee in the second quarter and to have settled on a new version of the company within a year. 
"We're going to move this process forward very quickly. We're not going to wallow and linger in Chapter 11 for a day longer than we have to." 
Although many have speculated that Enron will never emerge from bankruptcy and will instead be carved up and sold, Cooper said he is "not of that mind," adding that in his 30-year career of reorganizing companies he has seen only a few instances in which liquidation made more sense for creditors than reorganizing the ongoing business. Those cases all involved substantial amounts of valuable real estate, he said. 
Enron has a bit of that. Although it leases its Houston headquarters, Enron is building a tower nearly as tall next door. It has received $40 million in debtor financing to complete and sell that project. 
Cooper flatly states that he is not interested in doing a post-mortem on Enron, but he did acknowledge the "very labor-intensive" process of sorting through "hundreds upon hundreds" of so-called special purpose entities, which are financial vehicles commonly used by corporations to finance projects separate from the company's balance sheet and for other legitimate purposes, such as a sale and lease-back of a building. 
Lawyers and accountants are examining the entities to determine the extent of Enron's liabilities and the economic value to Enron of each vehicle, he said. A team of about 10 Zolfo Cooper employees, an unusually large number, is being assigned to Enron, Cooper said. 
"There's a difference between were the partnerships legitimate or not versus were they accounted for properly or not. Both of these are being looked at. We'll just have to wait to see what the attorneys say as that gets sorted out," Cooper said. 
Special purpose entities "are not good or bad, they're just instruments or vehicles which provide companies with financial flexibility to better manage their business, to better manage their balance sheet to fit the needs of their business," Cooper said. 
"The Enron phenomenon was the failure to transfer economic risk [from Enron to the partnerships] and the failure to disclose and the suspension of the corporate code of ethics and conduct that allowed people to get into a position where they had divided loyalties" by working for both Enron and the partnerships, he said. 
"What we saw here was a case where they weren't constructed properly, they weren't reported properly and by allowing someone to be on both sides of the transaction, you couldn't have really an arm's-length transaction. It's kind of like having you negotiate both sides of a prenuptial agreement." 
Despite its size, the Enron reorganization is much like every other he has handled, Cooper said. Those included Federated Department Stores Inc., Polaroid Corp. and Malden Mills. 
Unique to Enron, however, is the furor surrounding the rapid and stunning collapse of the business, Cooper said. 
"It's become an enormous lightning rod for not only the upset of people directly involved in the company, but it's become a lightning rod to coalesce all of these other national interests" involving such issues as accounting and corporate governance, Cooper said. 
"I hope people will be able to relax and calm down and look at this as an opportunity for a fresh start for our external economic constituencies, a fresh start by way of an investment and a fresh start for our employees," Cooper said. 
"It's sort of like when your car breaks down and you're in the middle of nowhere and you end up hating the car. You're kicking the tires. You're kicking the bumpers. After you get over it, you realize that it's still a good car. You get the tire or whatever fixed and you just keep going."

From:  Ray Bowen, Office of the Chief Executive 

One of Accounting and Controls primary objective is ensuring that internal accounting controls are properly designed, implemented and enforced throughout the company.  Enron's Executive Management and Board of Directors are committed to this objective.

A new group, Accounting Controls and Procedures, has been established to provide centralized management in meeting this responsibility.

Accounting Controls and Procedures will report directly to Dick Lydecker, Enron's Chief Accounting Officer, and will be led by Rick Carson.  Joining Rick will be Donna Lowry who will manage compliance and records retention controls.

As you may know, Jim Fallon and Rich DiMichele have elected to leave Enron.

Effective immediately, Dan Leff will assume management and leadership responsibility for Enron's wholesale businesses, in addition to his current responsibility for our retail businesses.  It is critical that we continue to focus significant effort and attention toward maximizing the value of these businesses.

Bob Semple, of Zolfo Cooper, will continue to stay closely involved in an advisory capacity with Enron's wholesale and retail business activities.

Dan will report directly to Enron's Office of the Chief Executive.

Re:  Management Changes

As a company working to emerge from bankruptcy, Enron looks and feels completely different.  However, one thing is the same - we continue to move and change at a fast pace.  Last week, we shared with you a developing management team.  This week, we want to update you on some further management changes that have taken shape.

Jim Derrick, executive vice president and general counsel, will retire from Enron effective March 1, 2002.

Rob Walls, currently deputy general counsel, will succeed Derrick and serve immediately as acting general counsel.

We are also happy to announce that Mike McConnell, formerly CEO of Enron Global Markets, is returning to the company to help identify and develop business opportunities within our remaining non-regulated businesses.

We will continue to share changes to the management team as they occur.

Dear Mr Motley:

I'm writing to tell you that our negotiations with the 
International Association of Machinists (IAM) District

This has been a difficult time, and I want to thank you 
for your understanding and continued support.

IAM District 141M will forward the details of the 
tentative agreement to its membership for a vote within 
the next two weeks.

This decision allows us to continue focusing on serving 
you, and I hope it renews your confidence in planning 
your travel with United. We look forward to seeing you 
on board.

Thank you,

Chris Bowers
