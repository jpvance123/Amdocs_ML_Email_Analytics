NewPower to offer another pilot program to Houston employees


Free remote energy management solution helps you to manage rising energy 
bills.
NewPower is launching a revolutionary technology pilot to the first 500 
people to sign up in the Houston area.  The NewPower Connections Remote 
Energy Management Solution is a pilot program designed to give consumers 
control of their thermostat via the Internet.  The program will allow 
thermostats to be adjusted from anywhere, with any Internet-enabled device, 
including computers, web-enabled cell phones, palm OS devices, or pocket 
PCs.  Sears Home Central will install and service the Remote Energy 
Management Solution at no charge throughout the duration of the pilot 
program.  For a typical household, the three-month pilot could result in up 
to 10 percent to 15 percent utility bill savings, based on personal usage and 
the size of your home.  


Be among the first to participate absolutely free.
Enrollment with the NewPower Connections Remote Energy Management Solution 
pilot program starts May 14 and continues through the end of the month.  For 
more information about this offer, visit NewPower's table located in the 
Plaza of the Enron Building near the down escalator from 11:00 a.m. to 2 p.m. 
during the week of May 14.  To become a pilot participant you need only to be 
a homeowner in the Houston area and have Internet access.  You do not even 
have to be a NewPower electricity customer to participate.  For more 
information about NewPower Connections, send an e-mail to 
connections@newpower.com.


Disclaimers:
Any contract for goods or services that is entered into by an Enron employee 
with respect to the NewPower program shall be solely between NewPower and 
such employee.  Enron assumes no obligation on behalf of NewPower and makes 
no representations, warranties, or guaranties with respect to NewPower, any 
goods or services offered or provided by NewPower.  Home.Enron.com

Current Notes User:

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook 
client will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail 
via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is 
configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is 
migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your 
web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and 
To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook 
client is configured on your desktop.

2. Remote access to your mailbox.
After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) 
for remote access to your mailbox.

PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while 
connecting to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA 
available from your home or when traveling abroad.

HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  
http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe

Substitute "john.doe" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You 
will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in "corp/your user 
id" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You 
will now be able to view your mailbox.

 

PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between 
the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things 
in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the 
functions NOT available via OWA:

Features NOT available using OWA:

-  Tasks
-  Journal
-  Spell Checker
-  Offline Use
-  Printing Templates
-  Reminders
-  Timed Delivery
-  Expiration
-  Outlook Rules
-  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall
-  Sharing Contacts with others
-  Task Delegation
-  Direct Resource Booking
-  Personal Distribution Lists

QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?

If you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the 
Outlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at:

 Outlook.2000@enron.com

Otherwise, you may contact the Resolution Center at:

 713-853-1411

Thank you,

Outlook 2000 Migration Team

Dear AMU Student:

Thank you registering for classes at AMU.  This e-mail is your
confirmation that we have received your registration and that you are
enrolled in one or more courses.  We wish you the best of luck in your
class.

To ensure that you are properly prepared for your course, there are three
(3) more quick things you need to do:

Step 1: If Eligible, Get Tuition Assistance

If you have not already done so, you will need to go to your Education
Center or Human Resource Office to get completed Tuition Assistance (TA)
paperwork.   In order for your TA paperwork to be completed by your ESO or
HR professional and accepted by AMU, the following information must be
correct:

- Course Number and Title

- Course Start and End dates

- The amount per credit hour ($250 per semester hour).

Please know that Tuition Assistance Regulations require that we not
provide access to the Student Course Guide until the AMU Financial Aid
Office has received your completed TA paperwork.  TA paperwork may be
faxed to 703-330-5109 and is required before the start date of the
semester.  If you encounter any problems with your TA paperwork please
immediately send an e-mail to hstine@amunet.edu or call (703) 330 - 5398
ext 117.

Step 2: Order Your Books

In order to provide the best possible customer service and to allow
students to track the status of their book shipments, AMU changed its book
ordering process effective April 9, 2001.  It is now requested that
student contact MSB directly to order books.

Undergraduate Students participating in the AMU Book Grant*, need to order
books as soon as possible by calling MBS after registering for their
classes.   Ordering is easy:

Call 1-800-325-3252

Give Customer Service your name, and the AMU course(s) you=01,re taking.

Step 3.   Tell MBS what address to ship your books to - and you=01,re done.

After MBS has confirmed your book order, you will be issued a UPS tracking
number that you can use to check to the status of your book(s).  If you
encounter any problems with your book shipment, or if your book(s) do not
arrive, you will need to contact MBS at the number listed above (please
note that APO/FPO shipping times generally take longer than regular CONUS
mail so please order your books as soon possible).

MBS can be reached toll free 1-800-325-3252 during the following hours
(Central Time):

Monday - Thursday 7 am - 10 PM

Friday 7 am - 6 PM

Saturday 8 am  - 5 PM

Sunday  12pm - 4 PM

All foreign or APO/FPO students may want to use the MBS commercial number
which is (573) 441-9179.

Graduate students are required to purchase their books.  You may order
books from our preferred provider, MBS Direct,  by going to
http://direct.mbsbooks.com/amu.htm.  If you order your books on-line, MBS
discounts the UPS shipping charges by 20%.  You can also call MBS
toll-free at: 800-325-3252.  For more information on shipping charges to
foreign addresses, you can contact MBS at 573-446-5299.  Please know that
the standard shipping time for books is 5 business days so please remember
to order your books as soon as possible before the start of your class.

Step 3: Maintain Your Student ID and Password

Your Student ID and password are your keys to access the Electronic
Classroom.  If you have do not remember or if you have lost your Student
ID and password, please immediately send an e-mail to
techsupport@amunet.edu.

Complete these 3 steps and you'll be on your way to success.  If you have
any questions or need any assistance, please contact the registrar at
(703) 330-5398 ext 104.

Best of luck to you in your courses!

Sincerely,

AMU Office of Student Services & Technology

* if you were a student prior to February 1999, and were allowed to
continue under the old tuition rate, you must still purchase your own book
either through MBS or another book vendor as the AMU Book Grant will not
cover the cost your books.

Given the growth in EES it has become apparent that it is time to consolidate 
the risk functions between EES and EWS.  This will provide EES with the 
systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups 
necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market 
opportunities.

With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk 
groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing, 
structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and 
back-office services.  These groups main function is to provide these 
services to EES.  We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice 
President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the 
Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will 
continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice 
President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the 
Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim 
Belden.

These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while 
ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading 
organizations.

These changes are effective immediately.  Please congratulate Rogers and Don 
on their new roles.

Houston Ballet gives free performances of Copp,lia
at Miller Outdoor Theatre in Hermann Park
8:00 p.m. Friday May 11, Saturday May 12, & Sunday May 13, 2001 
sponsored by AZURIX and ENRON

Considered the great comedy of classical ballet, Copp,lia  tells the story of 
a doll so enchantingly lifelike that she mesmerizes an entire village, 
captures the heart of a young swain named Franz and inspires the eccentric 
toymaker Dr. Copp,lius to attempt to transform her into a living, breathing 
human being. 

AZURIX and ENRON are Corporate Sponsors for Houston Ballet's Miller Theatre 
performances, helping to present these free performances of Copp,lia to the 
people of Houston.  Houston Ballet has a limited number of tickets for the 
seated area each night for employees of AZURIX and ENRON.  These tickets are 
available on a first-come, first-served basis by calling William at 
713-535-3235 no later than 5 PM today .  (Please be aware that all unoccupied 
seats are released at 10 minutes before curtain.)

Other, free, general public tickets for the seated area (max 4 per person) 
are available at the Miller Theatre 11:30 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. on the day of 
performance; for more information call 713-284-8351 for the Miller Theatre 
ticket information line.  Tickets are not required for the lawn area.  

About Coppelia
Copp,lia was first performed on May 25, 1870 at the Th,atre Imp,rial de 
L'Op,ra, featuring choreography by Arthur Saint-L,on and music by L,o 
Delibes. The work maintains a special place in the history of dance, serving 
as a kind of bridge from the glory of the French Romantic ballet in the early 
nineteenth century to the masterpieces of the Russian Imperial Theater at the 
turn of the century. Writing in The International Dictionary of Ballet, 
critic Karen Dacko analyzes the unique characteristics of the piece as 
follows: "Copp,lia owes its longevity to its inspired, very danceable score. 
But the ballet is also remarkable for its perennial appeal and for its 
historical significance as Romanticism's grand finale and classical ballet's 
prologue."
Copp,lia first entered Houston Ballet' repertoire in October 1974, in a 
staging by Frederic Franklin (who also performed the role of Dr. Copp,lius), 
and featuring scenery by Peter Farmer. In November 1979, former Royal Ballet 
ballerina Anne Heaton re-staged the work for the company. When Houston Ballet 
premiered its new production of the work in March 1992 featuring breathtaking 
d,cor by Desmond Heeley, Carl Cunningham of The Houston Post wrote, "It would 
be hard to imagine anything to cap the joyous, gentle, and glorious looking 
new production of Copp,lia the splendidly prepared company of dancers and 
musicians put forth Thursday evening on Wortham Center's Brown Theater 
stage."    (The Houston Post, March 21, 1992)
Heeley's designs for Copp,lia never fail to enchant, most notably in the 
second-act depiction of Dr. Copp,lius's workshop. The sampling of dolls on 
display pay homage to the era when automatons, or mechanical toys, were the 
rage in Europe -- and to Heeley's inexhaustible creativity. Among the 
eye-popping toys featured in  the workshop are a huge astrologer with a 
pointed hat and a robe covered in shooting stars and moons; a strongman with 
a handlebar mustache and barbells; Puss n Boots; an acrobat hanging from a 
trapeze holding the man in the moon; and a small ballerina dancing on the 
back of a goat. In the first act, the vibrant reds, golds, and oranges of the 
costumes worn by the peasants in the village conjure up a wonderfully 
picturesque vision of nineteenth century Bavaria.

sounds like a good idea.... id like to know where the author of this lives,  
however, cause its more like $2.00 a gallon here in san diego....  and  
besides, it really is fairly cheap compared to european countries because 
our  
govt subsidizes the entire automobile industry... gas, cars, roadways etc.   
realistically, you should be paying way more than what you currently do.   
maybe its time to start thinking more into alternative sources of  
transportation other that the individual automobile... i can go on with this  
subject regarding all the various societal impacts but i'll cut myself off  
there.  food for thought... 
By now you're probably thinking gasoline priced at about $1.49 is cheap. Me  
too! As it is now $1.58 for regular unleaded.  Now that the oil companies 
and  
the OPEC nations have conditioned us to think that the cost of a gallon of  
gas is CHEAP at less than $1.50, we need to try an aggressive response.  
With  
the price of gasoline going up more each day, we consumers need to take  
action. The only way we are going to see the price of gas come down is if we  
don't buy it.  But, that's not really a practical option since we all have  
come to rely on our cars.  But we CAN have an impact on gas prices if we all  
act together. 
Here's the idea - 
For the rest of this year, don't purchase gasoline from the two biggest  
companies (which now are one), EXXON and MOBIL. If they are not selling, 
they  
should be inclined to reduce their prices-and if they reduce their prices 
the  
other companies will too.  But to have an impact, we need to reach literally  
millions of users. 
But it's doable!  I am sending this note to 42 people. If each of you send 
it  
to at least 10 more ... and those 10 send it to at least 10 more and so on 
by  
the time the message reaches the sixth iteration we will have reached over  
one million consumers. Acting together we can make a difference. If this  
makes sense to you, please pass this message on, or one you compose, to at  
least 10 more E-mail addresses. 
**** PLEASE HOLD OUT UNTIL THEY LOWER THEIR PRICES TO BELOW $1.28 
-- $1.29 AND KEEP THEM DOWN. THIS CAN REALLY WORK. 
If you're not outraged, you're not paying attention!

The Enron Center Garage has opened.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the 777 Clay garage are being offered a 
parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. 
Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an 
exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You may enter & exit on Clay St. and Bell St., also pedestrians, will have 
to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

Please respond via e-mail if you are interested in acquiring one of these 
spaces.

John,

VCM is not an eligible swap counterparty.  Until established, we could 
possibly face FERC audit if we opened them up prematurly.  We consider the 
issue a high priority and will let you know when the guaranty comes in.

thanks

Lon,

I added sensitivity of the ostrip premium to the basis offset (output 10)
for the forward start options in OSTRIP2 model

I added forward vega (7) gas daily vega (8) and Charm (9) previously
for Larry May.


Please find the example spreadsheet and Exotica add-in.   (you need to
delink your Exotica addin and Browse to select the new addin).
After you test it, we can put into the release version.   Use the attached 
addin
as the temporary one.

Let me know your comments.

Zimin

With ECS (Enron Center South) rapidly approaching completion, Enron is forced 
to change the numbering scheme on the existing Stentofon system.  To increase 
our capacity to support this expansion, we must increase the number of valid 
Stentofon address numbers.  Enron currently uses 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600 
and 900 series numbers for the addresses.  In order to add more addresses to 
the system, Enron will be converting the dial plan from a three digit dialing 
system to a four digit dialing scheme on the Stentofon system.  This 
conversion is scheduled to occur on the weekend of May 18th.

In efforts to minimize confusion, we will convert all Stentofon addresses in 
EB1 to a 4000 series number.    (i.e.  If your Stento number was 364, then 
your new number will be 4364.)  We will also change all speed dials to 
reflect the new dialing scheme.  Please instruct the users within your group 
of this change.


Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

Then the sovereignty, power and greatness of the kingdoms under the whole
heaven will be handed over to the saints, the people of the Most High. His
kingdom will be an everlasting kingdom, and all rulers will worship and obey
him.'

Daniel 7:27 (NIV)

Come, Thou Almighty King,
Help us Thy name to sing.
Help us to praise:
Father all glorious,
O'er all victorious,
Come, and reign over us,
Ancient of Days.
"Come, Thou Almighty King" Italian Hymn (c. 1757)

Lord God, we yearn for the day when You will reign.... but we are not
alone. You are with us, beside us, above us, beneath us and within us. We
trust You to see us through to the other side of this troubled time. Stir up
Your Holy Spirit in us so that we can be peacemakers in the midst of
conflict, and sow a harvest of righteousness.
