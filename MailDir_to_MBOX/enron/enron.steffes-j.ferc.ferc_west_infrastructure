Subject:	Update on Timing of Proceedings

As Project Lead of one or more of the proceedings that are currently underway at FERC, would you please send to this group a timeline (date of filing or date of FERC issuance, due date for comments, estimated date for FERC action) for each of the proceedings that you are the assigned lead.  For example, for RTO Week, the timeline would be:


Project:  RTO Week

RTO Week									October 15-19

Comments on RTO Week							November 3

Estimated Date for Draft Circulation (and who is responsible for the first draft)	November 1 (Sarah will write the first draft)

Estimated Date for FERC Action							Mid-December (which could be in the form of additional proceedings, such as a NOPR)


Because we have so many proceedings pending, and because FERC continues to change the dates for interventions and comments, this information will allow us all to keep on top of what needs to be done.

Please send your responses to this group by COB Wednesday.

Thanks

Sarah

The FERC Infrastructure Conference in Seattle was planned to coincide with =
the dates of the meeting of the Western Commissions and Energy Offices, the=
 Committee on Regional Electric Power Cooperation (CREPC).  Enclosed you wi=
ll find my meeting notes from both the CREPC meetings on Wednesday and Thur=
sday (Oct 31 and Nov 1) and the FERC Conference on Friday (Nov 2). =20

The first day of the CREPC meeting dealt with development of a protocol for=
 joint efforts on transmission line siting.  The Western regulators are uni=
ted in their opposition to Federal pre-emption of siting.  Their view is th=
at biggest problem in the past has been warring federal agencies not the st=
ates.  FERC Staff said that Wood and Brownell are not seeking such authorit=
y.

The second day of the CREPS meeting was on RTO seams issues.  The work bein=
g done to enable three RTOs to work together was presented.  The States wan=
t FERC to let the three form initially.  Some state want to go slow.  (If w=
e were going any slower we would be dead in the water.)  Brownell attended =
all day and Wood attended in the afternoon.  Both were complimentary of the=
 level of work that been done.  Wood asked several times about problems wit=
h three organizations.

Chairman Wood convened the FERC Infrastructure Conference by stating that w=
hen he and Brownell went to the Commission, both as advocates of markets, t=
hey were forced to voting on price mitigation.  These Infrastructure Confer=
ences are being organized to gather facts.  He said he never wants to have =
to vote on price mitigation again because basic infrastructure has not been=
 addressed.  Both Governors Hull (AZ) and Locke (WA) addressed the conferen=
ce.  Hull wants Federal hands off and Locke says benefits of moving ahead w=
ith "experimental new organizations" are small compared to harm done of mak=
ing a mistake.  The panels during the day were primarily opportunities for =
invited parties to express their concerns with what needs to be built and w=
hat impediments are in place.  Both gas and electricity were addressed.  Th=
e panels and the State regulators again opposed federal siting pre-emption =
for transmission lines and supported three RTOs.  The general view is that =
more transmission and gas pipeline is needed.  There was also broad support=
 for demand bidding/demand side programs as part of the solution.  A good d=
eal of praise was give by FERC for the WGA study.  The study of financing m=
ethods for new transmission was the next promised step in the process.  I a=
m on that committee and next week will be submitting comments on the initia=
l draft. =20

I have updated Sarah's form for this project.  The Commission will issue a =
transcript and will accept comments, although no dates were given for when.=
  After you review the meeting notes, please indicate if you think we shoul=
d submit comments on infrastructure  expansion.
