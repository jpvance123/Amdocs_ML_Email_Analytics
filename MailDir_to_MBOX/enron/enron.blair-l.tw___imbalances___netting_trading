Let's plan on meeting today after Steve's staff meeting to discuss.  The existing imbalances as of the effective date of the tariff OBA will have to be individually negotiated with the party to resolve separate and apart from any imbalance that occurs under the new OBA.  TW's tariff states that if the OBA party does not execute/sign the tariff OBA, they are still subject to the tariff OBA if they physically receive or deliver gas into/out of Transwestern's system. These relationships will have to be managed carefully from all sides to resolve the old imbalances while moving forward with the tariff OBA for new imbalances.  

Thanks, Kim.

A couple of items need to be discussed:

If these volumetric contracts are changed to dollar valued obas as of their new effective dates, how will the accumulated volume balances as of the effective date be handled.  Also, what will be our game plan if the parties refuse to acknowledge the tariff oba.

Dennis - The following parties' volumetric OBAs were provided notification of termination last Friday.  Each party will need a new OBA (TW tariff OBA) contract set up in the system.  Please refer to the information below to properly account for imbalances and paybacks as we move these parties from volumetric to dollar valued OBAs.

Negative dollars represent amount to the shipper - Positive amounts represent amounts due TW.


Currently all shippers received a contract balance statement.   The imbalance is calculated on this statement as follows:
(Scheduled Receipts less Scheduled Deliveries less Fuel)  *  Avg index = imb value.    - - Currently, if TW owes a shipper for an imbalance (scheduled receipts are higher than scheduled deliveries and fuel) uncollected transport and fuel is not deducted from the amount payable to the shipper.

There have been few cash outs by TW to shippers in the past.  I can recall one instance when a large payable balance was created and the shipper nominated additional volumes to reduce the balance to a minimal amount.  TW then paid the shipper for the remaining balance.  

Also,  oba statements which reflect payable balances at receipt points do not deduct unbilled transport from the amount due to the operator.

Does our tariff allow us to deduct transport and fuel from paybable imbalances -  Will we have to reimburse shippers/operators for overbilled fuel?

Ramona, Lindy and/or Richard - Can you respond to Mary's questions about the derivation of the dollar amounts that will be included in the TW Imbalance Posting?  Do TW shipper imbalances include fuel & transport dollars if the imbalance is at a delivery point?  Do the negative dollars represent credits (imbalance due shipper/operator) and positive dollars represent amounts due TW?  What kind of supporting information does TW provide operators or shippers regarding their monthly imbalances?

Mary - The numbers in the draft were only for illustration.  As I understand it, TW plans to post by legal entity, the sum of dollar values for both Shipper & OBA imbalances (if the same Legal Entity had both).

	Rita, Mary Kay gave me a copy of this posting of imbalances for trading,  I was wondering if the party who provided this to you
	indicated whether the transport and fuel was included where appropriate.  I can't tell where it is appropriate because I don't 
	know what the credits mean and what the debits mean.  We need to have a supporting document that shows the imbalances 	and whether they are due TW or the Customer, whether they are at receipt points or delivery points because we need to 
	charge transport and fuel when we are posting a delivery that had not been previously billed.  If a party scheduled 30 and 
	actually took 40, they would owe TW transport and fuel on the extra 10, because we would have billed on scheduled.

Please plan to attend a meeting on Tuesday, August 21st from 2:30 to 4:30 in 49C2 (video) to discuss the letter TW received recently concerning our 637 filing.  If you have not seen a copy of the brief letter, dated August 8, 2001, it reads as follows:

	"On August 15, 2000, Transwestern Pipeline Company (Transwestern) filed pro forma tariff sheets in Docket No. RP00-490-000 in compliance with Order No. 637.  Protests were filed in this proceeding.  Transwestern and its customers have been meeting to attempt to resolve some of the issues raised in the protests.  Staff understands that Transwestern may file revised pro forma tariff sheets if there is agreement with its customers on the matters at issue.

	Accordingly, you are encouraged to finalize discussions with your customers and file any revised pro forma tariff sheets in the near future.  Otherwise, Staff will proceed to process your filing based on the pro forma tariff sheets submitted on August 15, 2000."

We would like to discuss our strategy in response to this letter.

Mary and I met with Mary Kay regarding the filing for mandatory cash-out at constrained points.  Assuming the historical data will support and demonstrate an operational need, she is on board with this approach.  gh

Subject:	FYI - 637 Imbal Mtg

We held a meeting to discuss the status of TW's 637 Imbalance filing.  Our current position (after discussions about a month ago) has been that we are concerned about filing anything in the 637 docket because it would stir-up segmentation and for now we want to let that sleeping dog lie.  We discussed again the possibility of making a separate tariff filing to pursue our OBA "wish list" outside the 637 arena and decided again that this type of filing would just get consolidated with our pending 637 filing.

After further discussion we decided that the one thing, most narrowly defined, that would really help us out with our imbalances is mandatory cash-out in constrained areas.  If defined this narrowly, this is something for which we can clearly demonstrate an operational need based upon historical allocation and imbalance data.  We think that we could make a 30 day tariff filing for this one change and have minimum risk of entanglement with the overall 637 filing.

Glen & Mary are going to discuss with MKM and Teb with Rob.  Lyn & Terry are going to pull together the last 12 months of data for constrained areas on our pipe (Ignacio to Blanco, Blanco to Thoreau, Thoreau to the border & check with Darrell for any other areas that should be included) and increased imbalance levels.  We plan to get together next week to discuss further.

Concerning the rest of our OBA "wish list", we are discussing whether to hold meetings with individual protestors to discuss only the Imbalance issues of the filing and work toward a "settlement" position on those issues to have ready in the event of Commission action in this docket.
