Hey,

I just got an email from Linda McKula (we went to her wedding in Napa);
anyway she was sharing the news that her and Tim are going to be having a
baby.  She's about 2 1/2 months preggo right now.  She said things have
gotton really quiet/slow work wise for them but they are thankful that they
still have jobs (for now).  Later.

I just found out that I might have to be in a 4 hour mtg today from 11-3; so
let me know what your plans are this afternoon via email.

Conectiv Completes Nuclear Plant Sales=20
By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis=20

[IMAGE]
[News item from PR Newswire] Conectiv (NYSE: CIV), an energy provider locat=
ed in the Mid-Atlantic, announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, Atlanti=
c City Electric Company, completed the sale of its ownership interests in t=
hree nuclear plants to PSEG Nuclear LLC and Exelon Generation Company. The =
ownership interests were sold for approximately $11.3 million, excluding re=
imbursement of estimated fuel inventory, subject to adjustment.=20
Analysis: This announcement from Conectiv came out late last week, but I di=
d not want to miss the opportunity to provide some analytical commentary on=
 what I think is a rather significant development. The transfer of ownershi=
p in the three nuclear plants included in this transaction is significant b=
ecause of its relation to Conectiv's unique competitive strategy and the ro=
und-robin way in which nuclear assets are changing hands in the United Stat=
es. Further, despite an increase in acquisition activity around the nation'=
s nuclear facilities, we still are seeing only a small number of companies =
that actually own or control nuclear power in the United States. =20
The divestiture of the nuclear assets includes only what is Conectiv's owne=
rship in the plants, which Conectiv shares with other companies (who also h=
appen to be the buying partners in this sale). The breakdown of the sale of=
 nuclear assets is as follows:=20
A 7.51-percent interest (164 MW) in the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station U=
nits 2 and 3 sold in equal shares to co-owners PSEG Nuclear and Exelon. Pri=
or to the transaction, PSEG Nuclear, an indirect subsidiary of Public Servi=
ce Enterprise Group Incorporated, and Exelon each owned about 46 percent of=
 the Peach Bottom plant. Exelon is the operator of the Peach Bottom facilit=
y.=20

A 7.41-percent interest (167 MW) in the Salem Nuclear Generation Station Un=
its 1 and 2 was sold to PSEG Nuclear, which prior to the sale owned about 5=
0 percent of the facility. PSEG Nuclear will remain the operator of the pla=
nt.=20

A 5-percent interest (52 MW) in the Hope Creek Nuclear Generation Station U=
nits 1 and 2 was sold to PSEG Nuclear, which is the operator of the plant a=
nd prior to the sale owned 95 percent of the facility.=20

As noted, the significance of these transactions relates to Conectiv's comp=
etitive strategy and the consolidation that is taking place in the nuclear =
sector. Let's look at Conectiv first. =20
According to Conectiv's President and COO Thomas Shaw, the divestiture of t=
he nuclear assets is consistent with the company's focused business strateg=
y on two core energy businesses: Conectiv Energy, the company's integrated =
generation and asset optimization group, and Conectiv Power Delivery, the c=
ompany's regulated delivery business. To support this two-tiered focus, Con=
ectiv has been in the process of divesting its baseload generating plants t=
o expand a generation portfolio that includes only mid-merit plants (units =
that have more flexibility to follow demand patterns). Mid-merit plants are=
 often viewed as units that fill the operating space between baseload plant=
s and peaker units. Whereas a baseload unit may have a generating capacity =
factor of about 80 percent, a mid-merit unit may have a generating capacity=
 factor of about 30 percent to 55 percent. From Conectiv's perspective, the=
 value of the mid-merit strategy is that these plants can be reserved to op=
erate only when demand is comparatively high. Further, the company believes=
 that mid-merit units are ideally suited to support the company's energy tr=
ading and asset optimization strategy because they are flexible enough to p=
rovide fuel arbitrage opportunities and ancillary service support when they=
 are not needed to meet higher demands for power.=20
The sale of the nuclear assets follows the previous sale of 1,081 MW of bas=
eload generating capacity by Delmarva Power & Light, a subsidiary of Conect=
iv, to NRG Energy and the divestiture of Conectiv's telecommunications busi=
ness (Conectiv Communications) to Cavalier Telephone of Richmond, Va., for =
$20 million. In addition, Conectiv sold its 50-percent stake in a 118-MW co=
-generation facility in New Jersey to Pedricktown Cogeneration LP, a non-ut=
ility electric generator, for $9 million. =20
Conectiv is divesting all of its baseload generation but has maintained own=
ership of some 2,000 MW of mid-merit generation in the Mid-Atlantic region.=
 The proceeds from the coal plant sales to NRG will reportedly be used to r=
epay debt and fund Conectiv's development of additional mid-merit assets. C=
onectiv's immediate goal is to build more than 4,000 MW of mid-merit power =
generation within the Mid-Atlantic region by 2004. Toward that end, Conecti=
v is taking some of the proceeds from the NRG transaction and using the mon=
ey to support a $300-million, 500-MW expansion of its Hay Road Generating S=
tation, which is currently a 516-MW plant that is primarily fueled by natur=
al gas. =20
The divestiture of both the telecommunications business and the baseload ge=
neration supports Conectiv's strategy of re-focusing on its core businesses=
, which are power trading and wholesale marketing (through mid-merit units =
only) and a regulated delivery business. Conectiv Power Delivery provides e=
nergy service to more than one million customers in New Jersey, Delaware, M=
aryland, and Virginia. Given the fairly distinct line between Conectiv's re=
gulated and unregulated businesses, I have previously speculated that Conec=
tiv could be preparing to spin off its unregulated businesses into a stand-=
alone company (a trend represented by AEP, Reliant and UtiliCorp). Conectiv=
 is in the midst of major restructuring, so it is unlikely that any such sp=
in off of its generation business would take place in the near term. Howeve=
r, as far as I know, Conectiv is the only energy company that has focused e=
xclusively on mid-merit plants. =20
Conectiv is also involved in merger proceedings with Pepco, a partnership t=
hat is scheduled to close in April 2002.  In this deal, Pepco is acquiring =
Conectiv for a combination of cash and stock valued at $2.2 billion. Both c=
ompanies will become subsidiaries of a new holding company to be named at a=
 later date. The partnership between these two relatively small and regiona=
lly based utility companies reportedly will create the largest electricity =
delivery company in the Mid-Atlantic region. By combining their two electri=
city delivery businesses, Pepco and Conectiv reportedly will more than doub=
le their customer base and expand their service territory by nine times.=20
In the nuclear sector, it is not terribly surprising that Exelon and PSEG N=
uclear would be the buying partners in the three nuclear plants sold by Con=
ectiv (despite the obvious fact that these companies already maintained maj=
ority ownership in the plants). Exelon and PSEG Nuclear are two of what is =
a small number of companies that are actively involved in the nuclear-power=
 space, and thus it is not surprising that they would be involved in the li=
cense exchange on these three plants. Exelon has the largest nuclear fleet =
in the nation and still outpaces most of the competition in the nuclear ind=
ustry, owning a total of 17 reactors. Earlier this year, Exelon CEO Corbin =
McNeill said he thought that a new nuclear plant would definitely be built =
in the next five years, and did not rule out the fact that his company migh=
t be the one to drive the construction of the new nuclear facility.=20
As noted, PSEG Nuclear is an indirect subsidiary of the Public Service Ente=
rprise Group Inc., which in 2000 was split into PSE&G, a regulated gas and =
electric delivery company in New Jersey and PSEG Power, an unregulated U.S.=
 power generation company. As noted, PSEG Nuclear LLC operates the Salem an=
d Hope Creek Nuclear Generating Stations in Lower Alloways Creek, N.J., and=
 oversees PSEG Power's ownership interest in the Peach Bottom Atomic Power =
Station, located in Delta, Pa. When the Conectiv transaction is completed, =
PSEG Power will own 100 percent of Hope Creek, 52 percent of Salem, and 50 =
percent of Peach Bottom.=20
In addition to Exelon and PSEG Nuclear, Entergy Corp. is another company th=
at deserves a mention when discussing the nuclear sector. Since 1999, Enter=
gy has been an active bidder on most every nuclear plant that has come onto=
 the auction block. Recently, Entergy bought Con Edison's Indian Point Unit=
s 1 and 2 nuclear power plants in Westchester County, N.Y. In addition, Ent=
ergy recently announced an agreement with the Vermont Yankee Power Corporat=
ion to purchase the 501-MW Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant in Vernon, Vt=
., for $180 million. With the completion of the Vermont Yankee sale, Enterg=
y will own a nuclear fleet that includes 10 reactors. Also note that the  N=
ew York State Public Service Commission (PSC) just approved the sale of Nia=
gara Mohawk's Nine Mile nuclear generating station to Constellation Nuclear=
 for about $780 million. The purchase prices for the 614-MW Nine Mile 1 and=
 82 percent of the 1,142-MW Nine Mile 2 are about $221 million and $559 mil=
lion, respectively. Constellation is another company that has consistently =
increased its nuclear power assets.=20
Given the volatility of natural gas prices and the high emissions associate=
d with coal-fired generation, many industry analysts have debated whether o=
r not nuclear power is on the brink of resurgence.  Exelon, for example, is=
 involved in a joint venture that is attempting to commercialize a new nucl=
ear technology called Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR).  Supporters of PBM=
R believe its relatively small size (110 MW), anticipated short constructio=
n time (24 months) and cost ($1,000/kW) can once again make nuclear power a=
n acceptable option.  In February of 2001, Exelon filed an application with=
 the U.S. nuclear energy regulators to license a similar reactor in the Uni=
ted States.  Clearly, steps are being taken to revive this controversial in=
dustry.=20

Subject: Enron's FERC filing opposing icap



Today at FERC, Enron filed a pleading requesting the complete elimination of "icap" as a product (including any "reserve type" products) based on the fact that the real time spot markets of the RTOS can effectively price this in the cost of energy.  The pleading also includes a proposed interim approach (with a two year sunset date).  This pleading was made in response to FERC's request for comments on "Ensuring Sufficient Capacity Reserves In Today's Energy Markets."

The pleading and affidavit of Larry Ruff, PhD are attached.

  RTO Week
Day 2 -- October 16, 2001
Transmission Planning & Expansion
The afternoon panel discussed transmission planning and expansion. The pane=
lists were: Jose Degado--CEO American Transmission Company, Michael Dworkin=
--Chair Vermont PSC, Mark Maher--VP Transmission Business Line, Bonneville =
Power Administration, Lara Manz--PSE&G, Masheed Rosenqvist--National Grid, =
Steve Walton--Enron.
General Observations
The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from t=
ime to time.  Commissioner's Breathitt and Massey were the most active in q=
uestioning.  The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initi=
al presentations, moving along the discussion by asking questions.  There w=
as some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management, howev=
er, there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmiss=
ion rights.  There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the R=
TO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market (wh=
ere are problems, how might they be solved, etc.) and that the where possib=
le that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit.  Ther=
e was a good deal of discussion of "least cost planning" and the identifica=
tion of options which are not transmission related.  All agreed there had t=
o be backstop authority to build transmission, however then the challenge i=
s who pays for it, which raises the need for dispute resolution. =20
Opening Statements
Jose Delgado: ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system op=
erator.  They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met.  They =
were formed by divestiture by IOUS, coops and munis and with a $500 million=
 asset base initially. Their current ten year plan will add $1billion of in=
vestment.   Their top priorities are connecting generation and load. =20
Michael Dworkin: Because transmission is a common good, construction affect=
s all parties not just one party.  The environmental and permitting of line=
s requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view.  The ide=
a of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multi-state project=
s, although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been us=
ed by FCC.  State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which=
 must be considered.
Mark Maher: FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when =
considering congestion management.  LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems =
with their multiple use obligations.  RTO West is developing a planning pro=
cess which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in =
the future.  The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process.
Laura Manz: The various aspects of planning are connected.  Pricing (LMP) i=
s the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and re=
sources.   No competitor should have an advantage over another.  The RTO ne=
eds a central planning process but it shouldn't push solutions.  The market=
 should decide on solutions. =20
Masheed Rosenqvist: The morning discussion of congestion management talked =
about hedging against risk.  The planning discussion is not about what we h=
ave now, but about how to avoid future congestion.  The Commission has take=
n conflicting positions in different cases.  The issues that need to be ans=
wered are:  How can merchant transmission be compensated?  Should transmiss=
ion projects be open to RFPs?  Is FERC open to market based pricing for exp=
ansions? =20
Steve Walton:  The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to =
settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that h=
as frozen transmission investment.  The RTO debate has been going on for 5 =
years or more and needs to be settled.  For expansion to go forward, there =
needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party.  Y=
ou are always going to have muddy issues in planning.  For instance if a 13=
8 kV line is all that is needed to day, but future considerations of scare =
right-of-way say a 345 kV line should be built, who pays for the extra cost=
.  In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dis=
pute resolution process, appeal able to FERC, to decide such matters.
Discussion
Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current cong=
estion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose.=
  Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built=
 with the beneficiaries funding.  Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about =
use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say=
 this is the best solution, i.e. least cost planning.  This lead to discuss=
ion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so=
 they can make intelligent decisions. =20
Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was (a) under built and =
needed lots of expansion so don't worry about overbuilding or (b) transmiss=
ion planning should consider all options before construction of new facilit=
ies.  The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the =
process.  Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions.  L=
aura Manz felt that the term "under built" is a secondary effect of not hav=
ing proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties.
Dick O'Neil asked if LMP will work in the West.  Mark Maher said it wouldn'=
t.  Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics, they manage h=
ydro facilities in PJM.  Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure=
 of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought n=
ot to be rejected just intelligently designed.  BPA is looking pricing mode=
l but LMP won't work.  Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch,=
 but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some "twea=
ks" like bilaterals and allow operator self-schedule output levels to permi=
t  river coordination.  Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to max=
imize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis.  PJM has hydro, =
but not 70% as in the Northwest.  Implementation will be different because =
such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro a=
nd base load coal.
In the summation at the end of the panel, four principles were listed:  (1)=
 RTO must provide information, (2) RTO should identify solutions, (3) RTO s=
hould be unbiased and (4) the RTO should be accountable.  The disagreement =
was over the last two points, Michael Dworkin felt that #3 (unbiased) was c=
ritical and that #4 (accountability) was accomplished by having regulators =
involved in governance.  Jose Delgado said and Transco can't be unbiased si=
nce it provides services, although the ISO above it can be, but accountabil=
ity is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake.  This last =
point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the =
tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues.

Hello Everyone, 

	This week again saw some upsets, both in college and pro games, however, the overall results were better this week than the past few weeks. In the college games, it was split between the Oklahoma and Nebraska game as far as who got it right, the Auburn/Arkansas game and UCLA/Stanford game were both missed by most people. Quite a few people also missed the Oregon/Washington St. game. 
In the pros, the New Orleans/St.Louis game was missed by just about everyone, everyone missed the NY Giants/Washington game, the Minnesota/Tampa Bay game was missed by quite a few people, and the Arizona/Dallas game was also missed by about half the people. 

	Through all that, Rob Benson is currently in the lead with only 5 games missed. Rob also picked Pittsburgh tonight. Still alive for the money with 6 games missed are Joe Quenet and Jeff Miller, who both picked Tennessee tonight. There were also 3 other people who have 6 wrong, however, they all chose Pittsburgh tonight. Therefore, if Pittsburgh wins tonight, then Rob will win outright. If Tennessee wins tonight, then it will come down to total points. Rob chose 38 points, Joe has 48 points and Jeff has 34 points. Therefore Jeff will win with a Tennessee victory and 35 or fewer total points, 36 he will tie with Rob. Rob will also win if Tennessee wins and the total points are from 37-42 and he will also tie with Joe at 43 points. Joe will win if Tennessee wins and there is 44 or more total points scored, 43 he will split with Rob. 

	We raised the entry fee to $3 per entry this week and will continue that for the rest of the season unless enough people want it back down to $2. We had 34 entries this weekend, therefore the prize money is $102 !!  There is no Thursday night game this upcoming week, therefore this coming week's picks will be due on Friday. Following is each person who played this week with the amount of games they missed.

NRC Approves Yucca Mountain as Nuclear Waste Site=20
By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis=20

[IMAGE]
[News item from Reuters] The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) signed off=
 on a plan to build an underground dump in Nevada's Yucca Mountain to hold =
radioactive spent fuel from nuclear power plants. Yet another step in a lon=
g approval process, the NRC approved a site suitability study submitted by =
the Department of Energy (DOE). The Bush administration must still submit t=
hat plan for congressional approval. The DOE in August gave a favorable saf=
ety assessment to the proposed project, which may face an uphill battle on =
Capitol Hill. It is heavily opposed by Democrat Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada, =
the new Senate assistant majority leader.=20
Analysis: This is a major step toward establishing Yucca Mountain as the na=
tion's repository for spent nuclear fuel, but the NRC approval of the site =
could be blocked by the pending vote in Congress. Since Sept. 11, new secur=
ity issues certainly have been unearthed that may give legislators in Washi=
ngton, D.C. pause, and support ongoing efforts to block the site. Neverthel=
ess, after a decade of study, planning commissions and public debate, the N=
RC vote clearly represents the strongest endorsement of the Yucca Mountain =
site and could very well be an indication of how federal policymakers will =
side on the issue. =20
For background, since the dawn of the nuclear age one generally accepted be=
lief is that the most feasible and safest way to dispose of highly radioact=
ive materials is to store them deep underground. From this starting point, =
the United States passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act in 1982 and charged t=
he DOE with finding an appropriate spot in which radioactive materials coul=
d be stored. From the beginning, it was understood that the NRC would need =
to give approval to the location selected by the DOE and that congressional=
 approval would also be necessary. In 1983, the DOE selected nine locations=
 in six states for consideration as possible depositories, and at that time=
 President Reagan approved only three of the nine locations for intensive s=
cientific study (known as site characterization). The three locations were:=
 Hanford, Wash.; Deaf Smith County, Texas; and Yucca Mountain, Nev. In 1987=
, Congress amended the Nuclear Waste Policy Act and directed the DOE to onl=
y study Yucca Mountain as a suitable location, based on the finding from th=
e earlier report. In other words, since that time no other location besides=
 Yucca Mountain has even been considered as a potential repository for nucl=
ear waste in the United States.=20
The issue is critical because storage capacity for the waste from nuclear e=
nergy and weapons has become increasingly limited. The Bush administration'=
s national energy plan, released last April, demonstrated strong support fo=
r the use of nuclear power as a supplement to more traditional fuel sources=
. Thus, the amount of nuclear waste in the country could increase considera=
bly in the near future, and the location of an acceptable repository has be=
come a top priority for the federal government. =20
What makes Yucca Mountain the preferred location? According to the vast amo=
unt of research compiled over the last decade, there are several characteri=
stics that arguably make Yucca Mountain the most appropriate repository sit=
e: it is a remote location and a long distance from a large population (100=
 miles from Las Vegas); it is located in a very dry climate, with less than=
 six inches of water per year; and, the location offers an extremely deep w=
ater table (800 to 1,000 feet below the level of the potential repository).=
 In addition, Yucca Mountain is located on federal land near the Nellis Air=
 Force Range and the Nevada Test Site, where atomic-bomb tests once took pl=
ace. Thus, it is considered a very secure area. Based on these characterist=
ics, over the last 14 years scientists have generally concluded that Yucca =
Mountain is capable of isolating spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioact=
ive waste. =20
Under the evolving plan, the site reportedly would store underground thousa=
nds of tons of radioactive materials from the nation's nuclear plants for a=
n estimated 10,000 years.  Yucca Mountain originally was scheduled to be us=
ed as the repository by 1998, but a delay in feasibility studies caused tha=
t date to be extended several times. It is presently expected that, assumin=
g the site gains all the necessary approvals, Yucca Mountain would be used =
as a repository starting in 2010.=20
However, while scientists may have been generally in agreement, reaching co=
nsensus among the other involved parties has been more difficult. From a fe=
deral perspective, President Bush and Vice President Cheney have supported =
the use of Yucca Mountain as a national repository. This belief has been sh=
ared by Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham. However, Nevada state leaders hav=
e demonstrated fierce resistance toward the use of Yucca Mountain for the s=
torage of nuclear waste, which has caused state / federal conflicts for the=
 last several years. Specifically, Nevada Gov. Kenny Guinn and the Nevada A=
ttorney General Frankie Sue Del Papa have said that they are opposed to usi=
ng Yucca Mountain as a repository and reportedly believe that the entire is=
sue should be put onto the back burner indefinitely, considering the recent=
 national events. =20
Water permits became one major conflict between state and federal officials=
. In fact, the federal government sued Nevada after the state refused to is=
sue water permits that Yucca Mountain would need to operate. Nevada had gra=
nted water rights to the federal government, but only for the study purpose=
s and not the actual use of the site. The issue is still working itself thr=
ough various courts. The latest word is that an appeals panel said a federa=
l court should decide the case because the proposed dumpsite is authorized =
under federal law. =20
Those who oppose using Yucca Mountain as a repository have consistently out=
lined their concerns in public meetings. Basically, the top concern is that=
 the radiation from the nuclear waste could seep through groundwater and in=
to the aboveground environment. Yucca Mountain is reportedly located near a=
 fault line, which has exacerbated concerns that the ground covering the po=
tential repository could be subject to shifting. The location of Yucca Moun=
tain, while touted as an advantage for proponents of the plan, has also bee=
n used by opponents as an argument against the plan. Specifically, opponent=
s say that Yucca Mountain is too close to a commercial air corridor (locate=
d about 11 miles away), and that a large number of military flights routine=
ly cross over the site.=20
In addition, the events of Sept. 11 certainly have heightened concerns abou=
t potential targets for terrorist activity, and despite reassurances from s=
cientists that the site is secure, opponents believe that no site would be =
attack-proof. Another concern is the actual transport of nuclear waste from=
 various locations across the country to the proposed site at Yucca Mountai=
n. The federal government reportedly claimed that it would not be responsib=
le for the actual transport of nuclear materials to the Yucca Mountain site=
 because the transportation would be handled by private companies.  Critics=
 of the plan say that this creates an unacceptable vulnerability for the co=
untry. =20
The next step will be for Energy Secretary Abraham to review all of the pre=
viously obtained material and make a recommendation to President Bush about=
 whether or not the federal government should proceed with using the Yucca =
Mountain site. All indications have suggested that Secretary Abraham will s=
ide with scientists that Yucca Mountain is an appropriate site and, after n=
early two decades of study, the pros of using this site outweigh the potent=
ial risks. =20
Regardless of the ultimate decision, action on nuclear waste is necessary. =
The sources vary on their estimates of how much highly radioactive material=
 waste exists in the United States. However, if we take the range of estima=
tes, it would equate to a football field ranging from 15 to 20 feet deep. T=
hat estimate takes into account all high-level nuclear waste generated in t=
he United States since the start of a nuclear program in the 1950s. Compare=
d to other hazardous materials, the amount of nuclear waste generated per y=
ear is very small. In the United States, all of the nuclear plants produce =
about 30,000 tons of spent fuel a year, whereas 300 million tons of chemica=
l waste are generated per year.=20

I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

   Napa);
      anyway she was sharing the news that her and Tim are going to be
   having
      a
      baby.  She's about 2 1/2 months preggo right now.  She said things
   have
      gotton really quiet/slow work wise for them but they are thankful
   that
      they
      still have jobs (for now).  Later.

      I just found out that I might have to be in a 4 hour mtg today from
      11-3; so
      let me know what your plans are this afternoon via email.

Nuclear Experts Respond to Yucca Mountain IssueAlert 
 By Robert C. Bellemare
Vice President
 
Brian O'Connell, P.E., Director of Nuclear Waste Program Office for the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC), and Janet Schlueter, Chief of Staff and Nuclear Materials Assistant for Commissioner Edward McGaffigan of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), sent us several clarifying points concerning Yucca Mountain and nuclear waste, which we believe should be shared with our readership. 
The action taken by the NRC on October 23 was not an "approval" of the Yucca Mountain site. What the NRC approved was the "site suitability guidelines"-the Department of Energy's (DOE's) Part 963 general repository siting guidelines that the DOE will use to evaluate Yucca Mountain when it submits a recommendation to the President on whether the site is "suitable" for the repository purpose. Then, after the unusual approval procedures of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA), the next step would be to submit a license application to the NRC to build the repository. The Commission's concurrence on DOE's general repository siting rule is separate and distinct from any comments NRC may have on DOE's preliminary site suitability recommendation. 
According to the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI), 2,000 metric tons are generated by the nuclear industry per year, not 30,000 tons per year as we reported. The entire industry has produced about 40,000 metric tons of used nuclear fuel over the past four decades. 
Finally, the federal government may not be able to avoid responsibility for the actual transport of nuclear materials to Yucca Mountain.  Section 137(a)(2) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act does call for the DOE to "utilize by contract private industry to the fullest extent possible." Regardless of whether the shipments are made by the government or contractors, all shipments must meet NRC and other federal and state regulatory requirements.

HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 23, 2001 -- You can hear them approaching from hundreds of yards
away. That guttural, rumbling, roar can only denote one thing, a
Harley is near. Harley-Davidson Motor Company (Milwaukee, Wi.)
(NYSE:HDI) has been an institution in the motorcycle industry since
1903 when William S. Harley and Arthur Davidson first painted their
names on the gas tank of the first Harley-Davidson (H-D) Motorcycle.
Originally designed to be a racing bike, the H-D bike won its first
race in 1905 and never looked back.
	   As the most popular motorcycle in America, H-D is constantly
growing in an effort to keep pace with ever-increasing demand, and to
keep ahead of the research curve on new product development. The new
millennium appears to bode well for H-D as they have announced plans
to spend approximately $250 million on capital projects in 2001 alone.
This includes grassroot plants in both Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and
will position H-D to maintain its lead in the U.S. motorcycle
industry. In addition to planning brand new facilities, H-D is also
expanding and upgrading their existing plants and research centers. In
Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, H-D is planning a 75,000 square foot (sqft)
office building addition and a 65,000 sqft plant expansion.
	   These expansions will enable H-D to maintain 800 jobs and create
393 new positions, something the Governor of the state is fully
behind. "The company is expanding and upgrading equipment at two of
its Wisconsin facilities," says Wisconsin Governor Scott McCallum.
"The quality of its products has helped raise Wisconsin's viability
around the world." H-D shipped 200,000 motorcycles for the first time
in company history last year. H-D's internal company goals had
initially called for reaching that sales milestone by 2003, the year
they celebrate their first century of business.
	   Harley-Davidson, Incorporated is the largest U.S.-based motorcycle
manufacturer, and produces heavyweight motorcycles and offers a
complete line of motorcycle parts, accessories, apparel, and general
merchandise.
	   Industrialinfo.com provides daily news related to the industrial
market place including industry alerts and databases for the energy
and industrial markets. For more information on trends and upcoming
construction activities for the Industrial Manufacturing industry as
well as other industrial sectors send inquiries to

Don't forget to pick up the most important person in the whole, wide world
today.  Remember, Friday traffic blows so if you wait much past 4:00 to go
get him, you'll be kickin yourself all the way home.

RTO Week

 <?xml:namespace prefix =3D o ns =3D "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:offi=
ce" />

Day 4 - October 18, 2001

Afternoon Session

=20

Standardizing Markets, Business, and Other Practices=20

Panelists for this discussion were:  Sarah Barpoulis, PG&E National Energy =
Group; William P. Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Chr=
istiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC Gene=
ral Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnes=
ota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Co=
mpany.

=20


General Observations


=20

The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left la=
te in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, t=
he commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of=
 all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed; =
much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seeme=
d very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry fo=
rward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover for=
ward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize tha=
t some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed t=
o be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was d=
iscussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the=
 reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was noticea=
ble conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two org=
anizations somewhat common during the discussions.=20

=20


FERC Deliverables


A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne=
eded from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they =
felt was critical. =20

The first major topic was "How many RTOs?  What is their scope?"  All panel=
ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b=
y FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific langua=
ge, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.

The next topic was, "What will be standard market design?"  Panelists varie=
d on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged f=
or one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid sta=
ndard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (=
followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the curre=
nt situation.

The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha=
t the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic=
 throughout their discussions, asking questions like, "Do we need to issue =
a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?" and, "How much detail do you=
 need us to provide?"   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they =
wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as t=
o say FERC should "Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a=
 little further."  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, bu=
t in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and t=
he need for cautious investigation. =20

One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc=
heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th=
e "RTO Design and RTO Implementation" section would address many of the que=
stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Korm=
os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying =
a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The se=
ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following =
questions:


?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occu=
r, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i=
s nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there=
 be others that must be accommodated?


?         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to sch=
edule ("covered" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protect=
ing from congestion charges (both "covered" and "uncovered" schedules are a=
llowed)?=20


?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission =
services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues=
 to be addressed?


?         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing pr=
ior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to reti=
re those contracts?  Are there other solutions?


?         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function?=
 Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules)=
, be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced sche=
dules), or will they be required at all?


?         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed =
in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary=
 services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as fina=
ncial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?


?         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses? =
 Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce=
ss, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technical=
ly unwieldy?


?         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrate=
d into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that =
non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to t=
reat each NJE as a separate entity?


Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica=
l questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which =
to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions=
, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., "do congestion management") will t=
ake a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., "LMP with financi=
al hedging instruments") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike =
about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible =
to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.

Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) refer=
red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati=
on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out=
 said, "My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't =
believe that that statement is true."  He then backpedaled a bit and said t=
hat it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assert=
ion by the Northwest interests was false.


NERC and GISB


A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-se=
tting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, "Are we looking at a bea=
uty contest between NERC and GISB?"  Cook and Boswell then went into severa=
l short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants cont=
inually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interesting=
ly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI=
SB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the "new" structure of NERC and=
 did not focus on its history.

Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a=
sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were=
 they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily a=
ble to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin=
g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Poin=
t, Brownell.

Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-m=
an.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's suppos=
ed "successes," such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will =
likely remember that these "successes" have not been so successful, resulti=
ng in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments=
 in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show=
 the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.

There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues=
, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some =
talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.

The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly ur=
ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade=
rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC s=
omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would=
 say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.

Let me know if you have any questions.

--------------- Authored by: Jeff Dietert ----------------
OUR VIEW:  ENE is down huge (-80% for the year, and trading at only
7.5xFY02) and its hard to imagine more confusion associated with the stock.
More pressure is likely today on the news of S&P revising its long-term
ratings outlook to negative (based on the decline in market capitalization)
and ENE's additional draw on its credit facilities (which does not change
its net debt, but prevents banks from denying access to its liquidity in
the event that the rating agencies do downgrade its credit rating, which
could break covenants and restrict liquidity).  We believe the major issues
are: 1) management's ability to regain the confidence of the street and
persuade investors that it can restore balance sheet strength and generate
the expected earnings and cash flow,  2) ENE must maintain its investment
grade credit rating, 3) ENE must successfully execute its divestiture
plans, and 4) ENE must control the timing of the recognition of the
write-down in the value of any assets whose market value is less than book.

IF ENE management does not step-up to calm investor fears, these fears
could become a self fulfilling prophecy.  In the potentially vicious cycle,
investor fears could drive the stock down, the lower stock prices force the
rating agencies to consider downgrades, potentially lower credit ratings
force counter-parties to reduce exposure with ENE, limiting ENE's to
generate earnings and cash flow.  Thus we see a big incentive for ENE to
clarify the issues.  We expect ENE to put together a more complete
explanation of the major issues over the next few days in order to
stabilize the stock.   If/when ENE schedules a conference call or road
show, we would consider this a bullish sign.  Absent further clarification,
the stock is likely to continue to be weak.   Our gut feel is that ENE can
pull it off and that long-term investors should hold firm, as eventually
the stock gets valued on earnings (with upside potential to $25+/sh over
the next 12 to 18 month period), rather than break-up value ($16/sh-see
below).  We believe new money (with high risk tolerance!) should wait until
ENE announces its intentions for communicating a clear path to recovery.

ENE's VIEW:  ENE has stated that it has reviewed its asset base with Arthur
Anderson and that no additional asset impairments are required other than
an approximate $200 MM charge expected in 1Q02 due to an accounting change.
With no further asset write-downs, and roughly $890 MM in asset
divestitures ($390 MM India E&P, $250 MM Puerto Rico power plant, and $250
MM Brazilian power plant) in 4Q01, ENE's D/TC ratio is likely to decline
from 50% at the end of 3Q01 to roughly 48% at the end of the year.  After
the close of the Portland General divestiture, expected by year-end 2002,
we expect its D/TC to fall below 45% (we are projecting FCF to be
break-even in FY02).  We estimate that ENE's interest coverage at the end
of 3Q01 is 3.5x.  ENE is currently rated BBB+ by S&P and Baa1 by Moodys,
and would need to decline 3 ratings to fall below investment grade.  For
comparison purposes, S&P's BBB median D/TC is 47.4% and EBITDA/Int. Exp.
coverage is 6.1x, while BB (non-investment grade) median D/TC is 61.3% and
interest coverage is 3.8x.

IMPORTANCE OF ENE's INVESTMENT GRADE CREDIT RATING:  We believe that ENE's
Wholesale segments, which generates 80% of its EBIT, would be
noncompetitive if the credit rating falls below investment grade.  In
addition, a decline in credit rating below investment grade would trigger
the issuance of 50 MM shares of common stock and $1 B in convertible
preferred stock associated with ENE's off-balance sheet structured
financing vehicles.  We believe ENE will do what ever it can to maintain an

investment grade rating.  Moodys has its BBB+ rating under review for a
possible downgrade.   Last night S&P revised its long-term ratings outlook
to negative due to concerns that the significant drop in market
capitalization in the past week has adversely affected the company's
financial flexibility and could impede its ability to pursue plans to
rebuild its balance sheet.

BREAK-UP VALUE:  We believe ENE 's Wholesale America ($2.7 B in TTM
EBITDA), Wholesale Europe ($900 MM) and Retail ($450 MM) segments are
conservatively worth a 4x multiple (recent multiples have been higher, but
we are discounting due to limited buying interest) or $16.2 B.  The Gas
Pipeline segment ($820 MM) and Global Assets ($200 MM) valued at a 6x
multiple are worth $6.1 B.  PGE valued at the divestiture price is $2.9 B.
Total asset value is conservatively $25 B, vs. debt of $13 B, leaving $12 B
or $16/sh for equity investors in a break-up scenario.  The challenge is,
if ENE loses its investment grade rating, the value ($16.2 B) of its
Wholesale and Retail segments would be materially compromised--leaving
little for equity investors.

POTENTIAL FOR ADDITIONAL ASSET IMPAIRMENTS:  ENE's Global Assets portfolio
includes assets with $6 B in book value (ENE's total gross PP&E is $14 B)
that has generated an EBIT loss of $18 MM (EBITDA of +$168 MM) over the
last 12-month period (4Q00 to 3Q01).  The Global Assets portfolio includes
Elektro (an electric utility in Brazil), Dabhol (power plant in India), TGS
(a natural gas pipeline in Argentina), Azurix and Enron Wind operations.
These assets seem ripe for a write-down although the company argues that it
has reviewed them with Arthur Anderson recently and that the assets are not
impaired.  ENE will have to continue to convince Anderson that the value of
these assets has not been impaired.  The write-down of these assets would
reduce shareholder equity and ENE's D/TC, threatening its credit rating.
It is not clear that ENE put all its under-performing assets in the Global
Assets portfolio.  There could be other poor performing assets in other
segments that are hidden by strong performance in its Wholesale business.

ADDITIONAL DATA POINTS:  ENE's counter-parties seem to be supportive and
have not indicated any change in business activity.  EnronOnline trading
volume was slightly above average yesterday.  Some energy traders have
bought ENE in their personal accounts, convinced that ENE core marketing
business is strong and the belief that the equity markets have
over-reacted.  Lots of ENE corporate finance people are working late nights
solidifying ENE's financial strategy (hopefully for a more complete
discussion with the street?).

THE SEC INQUIRY:  We believe ENE has an extensive paper trail from its
attorneys and accountants that will clear them of any legal problems with
the SEC associated with the LJM partnerships in which CFO Andy Fastow
participated.  We do not expect the SEC to find any legal
wrong-doing--although this doesn't mean that they won't express qualitative
concern over the appearance of the transactions.

Moody's Investors Service downgraded Enron Corp.'s long-term debt by one
notch this morning, a move sure to hamper the company's efforts to restore
investor and client confidence.
Shares of Enron fell to seven-year lows this morning, losing $1.51 to trade
at $13.89 in mid-day trading. In the past two weeks the stock has lost more
than half its value, dropping from as high as $35 at the beginning of
October.
Enron's rating was lowered by the bond rating firm from Baa1 to Baa2, where
it will remain on review for further downgrade, Moody's said in a statement.
The firm also placed the Houston company's Prime-2 rating for commercial
paper on review for downgrade.
The Baa2 rating is just two notches above what is commonly called "junk
bonds."

anyway she was sharing the news that her and Tim are going to be having a
baby.  She's about 2 1/2 months preggo right now.  She said things have
gotton really quiet/slow work wise for them but they are thankful that they
still have jobs (for now).  Later.

I just found out that I might have to be in a 4 hour mtg today from 11-3; so

AES Hits Brick Wall in Venezuelan Acquisition=20
By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis=20

[IMAGE]
[News item from Reuters] Venezuelan telecommunications firm CANTV, or Compa=
nia Anomima Nacional Telefonos, facing a $1.37-billion hostile takeover bid=
 by AES Corp. (NYSE: AES) has forced a showdown with the U.S.-based global =
power company by announcing a share repurchase program. The Board of Direct=
ors of CANTV, Venezuela's biggest telecommunications company, recommended t=
hat shareholders approve a proposed share buyback program of up to 15 perce=
nt of CANTV's shares at a price of $30 per American Depositary Share (ADS),=
 or approximately $4.29 per share. Analysts said the CANTV Board's proposal=
s, which would be submitted to shareholders at an extraordinary meeting set=
 for Oct. 24, clearly flung down the gauntlet to AES. =20
Analysis: AES' expansion in Latin America's telecommunications market was a=
lways seen as a risky move, and now that risk seems to be resulting in a bi=
g bite out of the company's strategy. CANTV, which was an appealing takeove=
r target for AES due to its long-standing monopoly over the telecom market =
in Venezuela, has a strong ally in the form of Verizon Communications (NYSE=
: VZ), which holds a 28.5-percent stake in the company. Verizon came out in=
 support of the 15-percent repurchase program being launched by CANTV, whic=
h clearly is a form of aggressive resistance against AES' efforts to gain c=
ontrol over the company. The repurchase could be seen as a power play, with=
 Verizon also seeking to increase its share in CANTV, which many analysts m=
ight see as a more appropriate synergy. However, this story also highlights=
 the difficulty that AES has had with its expansion efforts in Latin Americ=
a, especially since CANTV's resistance comes on the heels of AES' pulling o=
ut of another acquisition project in Ecuador. =20
For background, it is important to note that AES already owns 6.9 percent o=
f CANTV through its majority ownership of Electricidad de Caracas, Venezuel=
a's largest private electricity company. Thus, the takeover effort is an at=
tempt to gain majority ownership of the company and take control away from =
Verizon.  CANTV, which was privatized a decade ago, is a full-service telec=
ommunications provider offering switched and local, domestic and internatio=
nal long-distance service throughout Venezuela Company. CANTV also offers m=
obile cellular services, wireless services, Internet access and other value=
-added services, and owns all of the Venezuelan public exchanges and nation=
al network of public telephone lines. CANTV became privatized about 10 year=
s ago and until last year reportedly had a monopoly on the fixed-line telep=
hone service in Venezuela. The company has a market capitalization of $2.6 =
billion. =20
AES had bid $24 in cash for each of the 28.57-million U.S.-listed shares in=
 CANTV and $3.43 in cash for each of the 200 million shares of CANTV traded=
 in Venezuela. AES' offer for CANTV's American shares represents a 9.2-perc=
ent premium over CANTV's closing price of $21.98 on Aug. 29, the time at wh=
ich the takeover effort was launched. From the start of the offer, some cri=
tics charged that this bid was too low, but AES has maintained that the off=
er is fair. AES reportedly plans to sell off CANTV's mobile services, which=
 account for about a quarter of the company's revenues, and distribute the =
proceeds to shareholders.=20
CANTV was never very receptive to AES' bid, and did consider it to be a hos=
tile takeover. In fact, workers' representatives at CANTV circulated a stat=
ement strongly objecting to the bid from AES, stating that the deal would s=
everely damage Venezuela and CANTV workers. CANTV employees hold a 10.9-per=
cent interest in the company. Now we see that CANTV is upping that resistan=
ce a notch by attempting a repurchase of its own stock. Note that CANTV wil=
l most likely issue the buyback program at $30, compared to the $24 that AE=
S had offered. Thus, the challenge for AES, if it still wants to gain contr=
ol over CANTV, will be to increase its already 9.2-percent premium offer. T=
he word circulating in the industry is that AES still intends to proceed wi=
th its takeover attempt, and the CANTV strategy will not derail these attem=
pts. =20
AES' rationale for increasing its holdings in the company is most likely tw=
ofold in nature. First, AES obviously finds great appeal in the Latin Ameri=
can market as the company already owns electricity assets in Brazil, Chile =
and other countries. Just this week, AES announced its penetration of the A=
rgentina market by inking a $376-million deal to purchase distribution and =
generation assets in that country from New Jersey-based Public Service Ente=
rprise Group (PSEG). In another recent announcement, AES launched a cash te=
nder offer to acquire all of the outstanding loan participation certificate=
s of Empresa Electrica del Norte Grande in northern Chile, a company that c=
onsists of 716 MW of generation and 1,056 kilometers of transmission. In fa=
ct, AES reportedly rivals Spain's Endesa as the region's most dominant powe=
r company and by all appearances now derives a large part of its business t=
hroughout Latin America. Whereas AES was clearly diversified across the Uni=
ted States, Asia, Europe, and Latin America, many investors now perceive th=
e company as moving into a heavier focus on Latin America, which constitute=
s a risky proposition in and of itself due to unique politics in the variou=
s Latin American countries.=20
However, AES recently pulled out of its attempt to launch a $128-million ta=
keover bid for Chilean generator Edelnor. Currently, Edelnor, which is one =
of the largest electrical generators in Chile, is controlled by Mirant Corp=
., one of AES' direct competitors in the independent power producing market=
. Perhaps also reacting to the volatility in the region, Mirant has announc=
ed that it will not sink any additional capital into the Edelnor unit unles=
s it can be assured of repayment. AES did not give a reason for its decisio=
n to terminate the Edelnor takeover, but one can surmise that investor reac=
tor to its ongoing efforts in Venezuela may have been a significant factor.=
 Further, on Sept. 25, AES cut its earnings estimate for 2001 to a range of=
 $1.25 to $1.45 per share from a previous range of $1.75 to $1.90. AES blam=
ed poor currency exchange rates between the Brazilian real and U.S. dollar,=
 lower U.K. power prices, and the company's inability to replace earnings a=
nticipated from the planned acquisition of the Mohave power plant. The drop=
 in AES' earnings estimate may have lowered available capital that the comp=
any needed to purchase Edelnor.=20
AES shares were priced at $24.25 prior to the earnings revision. After the =
announcement, at least as of early morning trading on Sept. 27, AES shares =
were priced at $12.25, significantly down from the 52-week high of $73, whi=
ch is what the stock was priced at a year ago. As of early morning trading =
on Oct. 17, AES shares were priced at $14.81.=20
Moreover, investors did not react positively to AES' plan to increase its s=
take in CANTV. In fact, after word of the deal began to circulate on Aug. 2=
9 (a day on which many stocks fell) AES' stock closed down $2.94, or 8.3 pe=
rcent, to a 20-month low of $32.65 on the New York Stock Exchange. AES CEO =
Dennis Bakke immediately attempted to reassure investors that the purchase =
did not represent a change of strategy for AES, which he says will remain f=
ocused on power. In addition, Bakke noted that the purchase does not repres=
ent a new venture for AES as the company already holds telecom assets in Br=
azil and Bolivia. Further, Bakke clearly stated that AES is "not going to a=
nnounce a bunch of telecom acquisitions around the world." Nevertheless, so=
me investors believe that AES is imprudently expanding into the telecom sec=
tor, which is already significantly troubled, and becoming too heavily entr=
enched in Latin America, a market that is prone to political volatility. On=
e investment analyst perhaps spoke for many when he commented that AES has =
little experience in the telecom sector and its limited experience to date =
has not been terribly successful. This, coupled with the general market dow=
nturn for most companies with telecom exposure, does not make for a good re=
cipe from an investor's perspective, at least as of today. =20
In fairness to AES, penetrating the Venezuelan market could represent a ver=
y strategic move from a long-term perspective. With a population of 23.5 mi=
llion, Venezuela represents a large potential market for energy and other r=
elated services. In addition, Venezuela is an asset-rich country, particula=
rly with regard to oil resources. According to the Department of Energy, Ve=
nezuela is important to world energy markets because it holds proven oil re=
serves of 77 billion barrels, plus billions of barrels of extra-heavy oil a=
nd bitumen. Venezuela consistently ranks as one the top suppliers of U.S. o=
il imports and is among the top 10 crude oil producers in the world. In add=
ition, as noted AES' investments in Latin America are not exclusively focus=
ed on Venezuela, as the company also is present in Argentina, Brazil, Chile=
, etc.=20
Concerns about telecom arguably overshadow concerns about expansion in Lati=
n America and play a larger role in the drop in AES' stock, especially when=
 we consider that AES has been present in Latin America for some time. Only=
 little more than a year ago, the telecom sector was at its peak, with bill=
ions of capital investment flooding into the sector as wildly optimistic ex=
pectations for demand seemingly exaggerated the scale of the market. Howeve=
r, a massive downturn has ensued, impacting not only companies operating in=
 the telecom space but the nation's entire economy as well. The bottom of t=
he telecom sector has fallen out, due in large part to the fact that the in=
crease in bandwidth capacity has outpaced the growth in market demand. =20
As I've said before when analyzing this company, the further that AES depar=
ts from its core strategy, the more likely it is that we will continue to s=
ee volatility in the company's stock. Up until these recent announcements, =
AES maintained that it was engaged in three lines of businesses, which were=
 all equally important to its strategy: power generation, network delivery =
services and retail energy marketing. Generation always appeared to be the =
main core of the company's business model, as AES controls some 125 facilit=
ies totaling over 44 gigawatts of capacity worldwide. This business model w=
orked well for AES and was well received by investors. Any perceived deviat=
ion from this successful strategy-especially if it includes expansion into =
the dangerous territory of telecom-could mark a new and risky era for AES. =
=20
Nevertheless, one could also surmise that AES has found a market opportunit=
y that is worth exploring. Latin America has low electrification and Intern=
et usage statistics. Some analysts project high growth in the next 5 to 10 =

Caminus and Altra Energy Partner to Create
Full-Service Trading Software Provider=20
By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis=20

[IMAGE]
[News item from Reuters] Software company Caminus Corp. (Nasdaq: CAMZ) anno=
unced it would buy the software operations of privately held Altra Energy C=
orp. Caminus said it would swap 1.975 shares of its stock and pay $30 milli=
on cash for Altra's software business. That values the deal at about $62 mi=
llion, based on Caminus' closing price of $16.05 on Oct. 12. =20
Analysis: The announcement that Caminus and Altra Energy are joining forces=
 represents major news for the energy industry, particularly impacting thos=
e companies that are involved in the trading sector. On their own, both com=
panies have ascended in the trading space by focusing on a particular niche=
. Now that Caminus is acquiring Altra's software suite, which is primarily =
focused on the natural-gas trading sector, the synergy between the two comp=
anies creates a fuller package of offerings for companies that are involved=
 in energy trading. Essentially, Altra has two core businesses-an energy tr=
ading exchange and a software business. Caminus has entered into an agreeme=
nt process to purchase only the software side of Altra. Altra has a highly =
regarded portfolio of software systems and consultant services primarily fo=
cused on the automation of gas transaction management and pipeline operatio=
ns. Together, the synergy of the two companies is intended to enable greate=
r participation for traders in existing online energy trading exchanges. =
=20
Let's first establish the business models of these two companies so that we=
 can fully appreciate the synergies that the new partnership will create. U=
p to the point of this partnership, Caminus and Altra were not considered d=
irect-line competitors, as Caminus' business model focused on risk manageme=
nt while Altra focused on the actual energy transactions. However, there we=
re components of the companies' businesses that certainly overlapped. Camin=
us Corp. has created a software suite that helps utilities and gas producer=
s trade energy commodities in exchanges such as EnronOnline, TradeSpark, Ho=
ustonStreet, etc. Altra's software, which is used in the same energy tradin=
g portals, focuses on natural-gas transactions. =20
Headquartered in New York, Caminus, which went public a year ago, is a prov=
ider of software solutions (and consulting services) that help a wide range=
 of participants in the energy market to manage their risk factors associat=
ed with energy trading. Toward that end, the company offers two software pa=
ckages:
Zai*Net software solutions, which "enables energy organizations to effectiv=
ely trade and manage energy transactions." Zai*Net has been designed to add=
ress a wide range of energy commodities, traded instruments and associated =
risks and was designed to interface with both proprietary and third-party s=
ystems.

Nucleus software systems, which were designed specifically to meet the trad=
ing, risk management, scheduling, and accounting needs of utilities, genera=
ting companies, power pools, gas and oil producers, processors, pipelines, =
and other energy market participants. In other words, the Caminus Nucleus s=
ystem provides a tool for energy traders to organize, track and manage thei=
r various energy transactions from generation to end-user delivery. One of =
the advantages to the Nucleus software is that users can evaluate assets an=
d market positions in real-time and consequently determine acceptable risk =
levels.=20

Recently, Caminus added the Storefront product, which is a Web-based tradin=
g application that helps customers to increase trading volume and reduce tr=
ansaction costs by publishing bids and offers on the Internet. Also, just t=
his week at the Power Mart conference in Houston, Caminus unveiled a new so=
ftware product known as FrontOffice?, which gives traders of energy physica=
ls and traded instruments the ability to see how a potential deal will affe=
ct a portfolio before committing to the transaction. According to company r=
eports, approximately 80 percent of Caminus' revenue comes from software li=
cense sales. In addition, Caminus also has a consulting service that focuse=
s on risk management services for energy clients. =20
One reason that Caminus has gotten a good share of industry attention latel=
y is its efforts, along with other software companies, to establish a commo=
n standard for moving transaction data from energy trading platforms to tra=
nsaction / risk management systems. A few months ago, Caminus established t=
he Energy Trading Standards Group with HoustonStreet, and has since generat=
ed interest in some 30 companies to participate and help create universal s=
tandards for energy trading. One of the key objectives of the Standards Gro=
up is to help determine which technology should be used as the standard pro=
tocol for energy trading platforms. The technology committee is reportedly =
working on a beta version of XML standard for physical power transactions.=
=20
In September, Caminus formed a strategic partnership with Lodestar Corp., w=
hich primarily provides billing software and load forecasting solutions. Un=
der the partnership, Caminus and Lodestar will work to integrate and jointl=
y market their respective wholesale and retail energy billing, transaction,=
 trading, and risk management systems to create what they are calling a "St=
raight-Through Processing (STP)" environment for vertically integrated ener=
gy companies. =20
By comparison, Altra Energy is a private company located in Houston that pr=
ovides software systems primarily focused on managing the transactions and =
physical movement of the gas and pipeline segment of the industry. Altra re=
portedly has the largest base of systems in the gas segment of the market. =
Some of the specific features of the Altra software include scheduling of d=
irect access load, generation dispatch, regional transmission organization =
(RTO) connectivity, integrated OASIS reservations, and North American Elect=
ric Reliability Council (NERC) checkout and billing. Altra boasts a custome=
r list of about 100 clients, mostly in the gas sector but also including po=
wer and multi-fuel companies. Altra's software product suite includes trans=
action management tools known as Altra Gas, Altra Power, Altra Pipeline and=
 Altra Web, which all facilitate the exchange of a particular commodity.=20
According to Caminus, the value of acquiring Altra's software suite is to c=
reate an offering of integrated applications that can be applied to both ga=
s and power traders. Further, the exchange of customers should benefit both=
 companies. Caminus will have the opportunity to sell its risk management s=
ervices to Altra's customer base, and in turn gain the opportunity to sell =
Altra's new generation of systems to Caminus customers. =20
The European market is arguably the top focus of Caminus Corp. In fact, Cam=
inus believes that the global market for energy trading is presently "explo=
ding." According to Caminus CEO David Stoner, the global market for wholesa=
le energy trading, which consists of the European market, is six to eight t=
imes the size of retail markets. Consequently, a typical therm gets traded =
a number of times in Europe before it actually gets sold to an end user. In=
terestingly, about 30 to 40 percent of the companies to which Caminus has p=
rovided risk management consulting services are U.S. companies attempting t=
o expand in the European wholesale trading market. Caminus consultants help=
ed write the New Electricity Trading Arrangements (NETA) for the British go=
vernment, due to be implemented by the end of 2001 or early 2002. Although =
smaller than the U.S. market, Britain has been experiencing privatization a=
nd various levels of deregulation since 1983, providing valuable experience=
 and depth. Besides the U.K., Caminus has been active throughout Europe in =
Italy, Spain, Holland, Belgium, Germany, and the Nordic countries through N=
ORDPOOL.=20
Earnings for Caminus have been fairly strong up until recently, when fallou=
t from the events of Sept. 11 began to impact the company's business. For 2=
Q 2001, Caminus reported that its total revenues increased 58 percent to $1=
7.7 million, compared to $11.2 million for 2Q 2000. Specifically, revenues =
from the company's software license fees increased 61 percent to $7.5 milli=
on during the same quarter. However, for 3Q 2001, Caminus lost $369,000, or=
 2 cents a share, on revenue of $14.7 million, due primarily to the fact so=
me license sales that were expected to close did not. Specifically, Caminus=
 says that much of the revenue from its license sales is booked during the =
last month of each quarter. Given the impact that the events of Sept. 11 ha=
d on many companies, a large part of this anticipated revenue was not booke=
d as scheduled.=20
Moving forward, Caminus says that the addition of Altra's software should r=
esult in an increase of its 2002 revenue guidance by about 40 percent. Cami=
nus also expects the partnership with Altra to increase its 4Q earnings to =
27 cents a share, compared with a previous estimate of 23 cents a share, al=
though analysts are still projecting 19 cents a share for the fourth quarte=
r. =20
Deregulation has opened up many new opportunities for generation companies =
to trade and market power in new regions. However, with these opportunities=
 come considerable risks. Hence, creating this balance between risk and opp=
ortunity in the energy trading space is the market niche in which Caminus a=
nd Altra operate. However, the software market in the energy trading space =
is becoming increasingly competitive. Every month, new competitors in this =
space emerge, so it is difficult to offer a comprehensive list. However, so=
me competitors that also seek market share in the niche now occupied by Cam=
inus / Altra are Allegro Development, KWI and SolArc (to name just a few). =
=20
Moreover, competition in wholesale trading should continue to gain momentum=
, regardless of the status of deregulation in a particular state. The whole=
sale market is without question far more attractive to traders than the ret=
ail market, and as I mentioned power is often traded many times on the whol=
esale market before it reaches the end user. Thus, consolidation within the=
 energy-trading software space should continue, and I would expect Caminus =
to proceed with further acquisitions once it integrates the Altra software =
into its service offerings. =20

Clarification Statement to 10/16/01 IssueAlert on Dynegy: In its 3Q 2001 ea=
rnings statement, Dynegy reported that net income of its transmission and d=
istribution company Illinois Power was $26 million, versus $27 million in 3=
Q 2000. In the 10/16 column, we incorrectly stated that Illinois Power had =
taken a loss of $15 million. The loss of $15 million was reported by Dynegy=
's telecommunications segment, which was duly noted in the article. We apol=
ogize for any confusion this error might have caused.=20

Energy Company Values Sink
In Response to Changing Times=20
By Robert C. Bellemare
Vice President=20

[IMAGE]
Constellation Energy's (NYSE:CEG) shares fell nearly 11 percent on Friday i=
n response to announcements that the company is cutting its earnings' proje=
ctions, shelving plans to split the company into two parts, and severing it=
s ties with investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) which would have been a=
 minority partner in its energy-trading operation if the spin-off had gone =
ahead.=20
Analysis:  Constellation Energy's stock value dropped to its lowest level i=
n seven years-down nearly 11 percent in one day, and down over 45 percent s=
ince May 1, 2001.  But perhaps what is most important about Constellation i=
s its shift in business strategy as it becomes the second company of the we=
ek to announce it is withdrawing plans to split its company into two parts.=
  Earlier in the week Allegheny Energy (NYSE:AYE) announced it would hold o=
ff on its planned initial public offering (IPO) of Allegheny Energy Supply =
Company, its unregulated power generation and trading subsidiary, until mar=
ket conditions improve.=20
The dramatic shift in company strategy appears to be driven by the same for=
ces.  Constellation sited falling energy prices, the changing nature of the=
 California power crisis and weak economic conditions as the main reasons f=
or dropping its company-separation plans.  The company said it would now fo=
cus on using its "single" status to leverage its balance sheet to participa=
te in the consolidation of the wholesale electricity industry in the United=
 States.  "What seems to matter now is size and stability and we think that=
 comes from being a single company ? What has changed (in the last one year=
) is the significant change in the immediate growth rate we are seeing for =
new power plants ? the reasons are simple and profound.  The world has chan=
ged,'' Constellation Energy Chairman Christian Poindexter said in a confere=
nce call with the media. =20
The change in Constellation's strategy will be costly.  The company will pa=
y Goldman Sachs about $355 million to terminate their power-marketing agree=
ment, $159 million which Goldman had previously put in the business, and $1=
96 million in future income Goldman would have earned had the business cont=
inued.  Constellation expects the Goldman Sachs business termination will c=
ause the company to record a $200-million special expense in the fourth qua=
rter.  The company said that its split-up with Goldman Sachs was amicable. =
 Goldman's relationship with Constellation started in the mid-nineties when=
 the investment bank was looking for a partner to help it break into the en=
ergy trading and marketing business.  In 1999 Goldman agreed it would take =
a 17.5-percent stake in Constellation's trading business when the state of =
Maryland deregulated the power industry and Constellation decided to make a=
 separate trading company.  Poindexter indicated that Goldman did not want =
to be part of a situation where energy trading and generation would remain =
together.
It certainly has been an active week for Constellation as it has made other=
 significant announcements concerning its future plans.  Mayo A. Shattuck I=
II was elected to the position of president and CEO effective Nov. 1, 2001.=
  Shattuck recently resigned his position as chairman and CEO of Deutsche B=
anc. Alex Brown and has served on Constellation's board of directors for th=
e past seven years.  On Oct. 24, the New York Public Service Commission sai=
d it would approve the sale of Niagara Mohawk's Nine Mile nuclear generatin=
g station in New York to Constellation Nuclear for $780 million.  Constella=
tion Nuclear is a unit of the Constellation Energy Group.  As part of the s=
ale, Constellation has agreed to sell 90 percent of Nine Mile's output at f=
ixed prices for 10 years, or through August 2009 if the operating license o=
f Nine Mile 1 is not extended.=20
The unregulated generation and trading activities continue to drive the bul=
k of earnings for both Constellation and Allegheny.  Constellation's domest=
ic merchant energy business contributed $0.89 of their $1.00 earnings per s=
hare of common stock for the quarter ending Sept. 30, 2001, slightly higher=
 than last year when the business contributed $0.87 of the $0.98 per share =
in earnings for the same quarter.  Allegheny Energy reported that their thi=
rd-quarter profits more than doubled on increased generation capacity and t=
he acquisition of a trading and marketing unit.  Allegheny's third-quarter =
earnings were $1.33 per share, compared with $0.69 per share one year ago, =
and beating analysts' earnings of $1.10 to $1.28 per share.  Allegheny is c=
onfident that its year-end earnings will be within its guidance range of $3=
.80 to $4.10 per share.  =20
Despite the strong earnings, Allegheny's stock price has dropped over 30 pe=
rcent since May, and over 5 percent in the past 10 trading days.  The drop =
in energy stock value appears to be driven by softening wholesale power pri=
ces.  Earlier in the month Lehman Brothers lowered its estimate of Alleghen=
y's 2002 earnings by 12 cents, to $4.03, citing reduced forward power price=
 assumptions.  =20
The high-flying days of the recent past, where energy companies' price-to-e=
arnings (P/E) multiples were exceeding 50 in certain cases, appear to be ov=
er.  Many power producers are returning to their roots-scrapping plans for =
splitting operations and questioning whether more risky overseas operations=
 can be supported by lower prices brought on by a slowing economy and softe=
ning wholesale market prices.  Paul Patterson, an energy analyst with ABN A=
mro, said there are common themes affecting the industry:  "One is lower po=
wer prices and the margins that are associated with them. And two is lower =
stock prices and the ability to finance more asset driven growth." =20
AES Corp. (NYSE:AES ), apparently agrees.  Its earnings fell for a second c=
onsecutive quarter on poor results from operations in Brazil and Britain an=
d said last Thursday it would revamp its organization and did not rule out =
selling off assets.  AES' Chief Executive Officer Dennis Bakke indicated AE=
S was placing a renewed emphasis on the traditionally profitable, long-term=
 contract generation business. By placing generating capacity into long-ter=
m contracts a company is able to provide profit stability during times of f=
lat growth.  Just one year ago physical reserve margins in power markets we=
re very low, allowing generation companies to achieve high profits for thei=
r product.  But with the slowing economy, mild weather and consumer respons=
e to the higher prices, power demand for 2001 is flat or even down from one=
 year ago in many parts of the country.  =20
The recent actions of Constellation, Allegheny and AES likely indicate a fu=
ndamental shift in the electric business.  Their actions are, in some respe=
cts, a return to the past-companies striving for predictability and reliabi=
lity in their power supply costs, profits and operations.  Perhaps most sig=
nificantly, companies are once again rethinking their strategy in regard to=
 whether or not they will continue to be an integrated business.  As Conste=
llation concluded, one way to achieve and maintain a critical mass of busin=
ess is to remain an integrated company.  We would not be surprised if other=
s come to the same conclusion.  =20

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

Heres your second and final reminder for the day (just in case you already
forgot)

Alex is now in Group H, his bag is in Gard 2, #242

If you pick him up between 4:00 and 4:30 he should be in the computer room.
If you get him between 3:30-4:00 he'll be in the 'Art room' which is
straight back all the way to the end (its the room right next to Gard 1,
where you would drop him of in the morning)

You be nice to him, and play with him..... NO MORE NEWS, NO MORE NEWS...
I'm gonna ask him what you guys did when I get home so you best be good...

The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

Subject:	Update on RTOs -- Today's FERC meeting

TJ and Claudette -- please forward to your groups:


FERC held a discussion today on the status of NE, SE, and Midwest RTO proposals.  The FERC judges and staff gave the Commission reports from the mediations and current MISO, SPP and Alliance filings.  While there was much discussion about the appropriate model (non-profit ISO, Transco, ITC), with questions on whether congestion management models were the same or simply compatible, no decisions were made by FERC.  Chairman Wood did commit to quickly providing "certainty" to all stakeholders, including the investment community.  He asked FERC Staff to prepare reports on each region based on comments received at RTO week and through filed RTO week comments (Enron will file Nov. 2) and report back to FERC at the Nov. 7 meeting.

Enron's Departure from Core Business
Takes a Toll on Performance =20
By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis=20

[IMAGE]
[News item from Reuters] Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE) stock sustained further he=
avy losses on October 19 as investor confidence in the former Wall Street f=
avorite remained at a low ebb after it reported its first quarterly loss in=
 over four years. The energy giant's stock was off $3.32 or 11.45 percent a=
t $25.68 per share at mid-day trade on Oct. 19, making a cumulative loss of=
 28 percent for a week in which it reported a third-quarter loss of $638 mi=
llion. As of early morning trading on Oct. 22, Enron shares were priced at =
$21.99, a reflection of new developments (including a new Securities and Ex=
change inquiry) that have caused uncertainty about the company among invest=
ors.=20
Analysis: Enron's first financial report since the departure of former CEO =
Jeffrey Skilling in August has not done much to once again instill investor=
 confidence in the company, which has experienced one of its most turbulent=
 years in recent memory. While Skilling cited personal reasons for his depa=
rture, many analysts suspected that a significant drop in Enron's share pri=
ce and financial losses in its diversified businesses also played a role. A=
t the time of Skilling's departure, Enron's stock had tumbled to a 52-week =
low. However, based on the new 3Q report, it now appears that Enron's downw=
ard turn may be continuing despite the return of Kenneth Lay to the company=
's top spot. In essence, Enron's financial problems have been caused by bus=
inesses that the company has established as a way to diversify from its cor=
e focus on wholesale power sales. It appears that Enron is learning a costl=
y lesson-namely that investors are not responding favorably to the company'=
s innovation, especially if bottom line performance is in any way compromis=
ed. The road ahead may remain uncertain for Enron, as a good number of unre=
solved issues and a new Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) inquiry in=
to financial dealings of its chief financial officer continue to overshadow=
 the company.=20
Let's first establish the financial losses that Enron has reported in the t=
hird quarter. As noted, as a whole the company reported $638 million in los=
ses, after taking $1.01 billion in charges associated with several of its n=
on-core businesses. When we break down the losses, it becomes clear that En=
ron is struggling with its operations in three businesses: water, broadband=
 and the retail power market. Specifically, Enron reported $287 million in =
charges from Azurix, its water and wastewater business; $180 million in cha=
rges related to the downsizing of its broadband operations (including sever=
ance costs and losses on inventory sales and customer contracts); and $544 =
million in what the company is calling "investment losses." Evidently, abou=
t half of the $544-million figure is related to Enron's investment in NewPo=
wer Company, the retail electricity and natural-gas provider that Enron lau=
nched about two years ago with partners America Online and IBM. Enron owns =
45 percent of NewPower. In addition, Enron's debt to total capitalization r=
atio reportedly will increase to about 50 percent, although Lay says that p=
ending asset sales may reduce that amount to 40 percent by the end of 2002.=
 However, it is important to note that Enron's 3Q recurring net income (bef=
ore the write-offs) did increase 35 percent to $393 million, or 43 cents a =
diluted share, and revenue in the quarter rose to $47.6 billion from $30 bi=
llion in 3Q 2000.=20
The losses associated with NewPower are particularly interesting. As one of=
 the leading investors in the company, Enron drove NewPower's aggressive bu=
siness focus on retail residential power sales, despite ongoing concerns ab=
out the development of retail competition across the United States. NewPowe=
r went public last year at an opening price of $21, and in the early days o=
f its initial public offering was trading above that price. However, the co=
mpany's stock has experienced a devastating drop in value, and is currently=
 priced at $1.25. NewPower is not scheduled to release its own 3Q financial=
 statement until early November, but it is expected that the company will c=
ontinue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future. Specificall=
y, NewPower recently reiterated its earlier expectations of a 3Q loss of $6=
5 million to $70 million, or $1.12 to $1.20 a share. Third-quarter revenue =
reportedly will be slightly lower than the $60 million to $65 million that =
the company had forecast in August. =20
In analyzing NewPower's 2Q financial losses (see IssueAlert from 8/8/01 at =
www.scientech.com/rci ), I argued that the company is really struggling fro=
m a mix of positive and negative factors in its efforts to become the leadi=
ng retail energy provider in residential and small business markets in the =
United States. On the positive side, NewPower has recently secured a large =
number of new customer accounts, most significantly from its purchase of cu=
stomers and related assets from AES Corp. and DTE Energy. These purchases p=
rompted an impressive growth spurt for NewPower, and the company reportedly=
 now has a customer base in 22 markets in 10 states. However, the bad news =
for NewPower is that its losses continue to widen, apparently resulting fro=
m a combination of weather factors and financial hits absorbed in several o=
f the states in which the company operates. This dichotomy does not appear =
to be getting any better, and the company's stock has continued to drop as =
a result.=20
In an effort to alleviate some of its financial woes, NewPower recently rev=
ised an existing master netting agreement with Enron Corp. and several of i=
ts subsidiaries. The revised agreement essentially lowers the amount of cas=
h collateral that NewPower is required to post to the Enron subsidiaries th=
rough Jan. 4, 2002. With the lowered financial obligations that it must mak=
e to Enron, NewPower believes that it will have sufficient financial resour=
ces to conduct its business in the near term until it secures ongoing asset=
-based financing.  =20
However, from Enron's perspective, the losses associated with NewPower (and=
, by the same token, the losses in water and broadband) have contributed to=
 a steady drop in its own stock price. The message is clear: The businesses=
 that Enron plunged into as a way to diversify have tainted the company as =
a whole. Further, what some analysts perceived as brash hubris on Enron's p=
art has not translated into measurable profits, and consequently Wall Stree=
t has reacted by sending Enron's stock to a level that is about half of whe=
re it was a year ago. The individual sectors that Enron has pursued are all=
 unique, but they share the common denominator of taking Enron away from wh=
at was a successful core business. Further, they are similar in that Enron =
aggressively sunk large sums of capital into new business lines for which i=
t arguably had unrealistic expectations for growth. The problem with Enron'=
s bandwidth unit is that the company has faced an unanticipated excess of f=
iber-optic lines, which has prevented the demand for the division's service=
s from materializing as anticipated. The problem with Azurix, which has bee=
n losing money since its formation in 1998, is that privatization of the wa=
ter sector has not materialized as quickly as Enron and other companies ant=
icipated. In addition to these problem areas, Enron also faces challenges r=
elated to its investments in India (where it is locked into a legal battle =
with the state government) and California (from which Enron has yet to rece=
ive full payment for previous power sales). =20
In addition to the losses outlined in the 3Q report, there are new issues t=
hat are brewing at the start of this week. First, the SEC has requested tha=
t Enron provide information regarding "certain related party transactions."=
 Not much additional information is presently available about this inquiry.=
 However, it is probably connected to earlier reports about concerns relate=
d to the dealings of Enron's Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, who up =
until very recently had run a limited partnership that bought assets from E=
nron. Ken Lay has said that Enron will cooperate fully with the SEC's reque=
st. In a separate development, several mutual funds (including AIM Constell=
ation that once held large positions in Enron) have either liquidated or re=
duced their holdings in the company, which has further weakened Enron's sto=
ck value. Portfolio managers of the mutual funds have cited concerns about =
Enron's ability to balance its new businesses with its core strength as an =
energy trader.=20
The present challenge for Enron is to convince investors that the company r=
emains on solid ground despite the losses. Thus, Lay has been quick to reit=
erate that earnings from the company's energy and gas-pipeline business are=
 still strong. Further, Lay says that the charges reported in the third qua=
rter should be seen as a way to "clear away issues that have clouded the pe=
rformance and earnings potential of our core energy businesses." Neverthele=
ss, the fact remains that Enron has invested huge amounts of money toward i=
ts diversification effort, and in addition to water and broadband the compa=
ny has invested into the steel and pulp and paper sectors as well. Thus, se=
veral questions remain at this juncture. Are the losses reported in the thi=
rd quarter only a temporary setback for Enron that will clear the way for t=
he company to return to a primary focus on its core business of energy trad=
ing? Or, will the losses continue into the fourth quarter and 2002? Moving =
forward, will Enron once again reshape its business model and eliminate the=
 various businesses to which investors have reacted less than favorably? On=
ly time will tell as the industry continues to watch the developments at En=
ron, which is clearly a company in the midst of another wave of change.=20

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

As we near the end of the year, I want to make clear some individual VAR limits I have come up with as we go forward.  These will change from time to time as to allocate VAR to desks that are profitable and re-adjust VAR when desks are not profitable.  Please read carefully.  If you have any questions feel free to see me.  There will be penalties for not staying within your VAR limits.  I will be reasonable but fines will be assessed for repeated breakage.

Today FERC issued the following draft orders:

NYISO TEP and Bid Cap (ER01-3001):  Commission granted NYISO's request to extend the currently effective $1000/MWh Bid Caps on certain NYISO adminstered markets, and to extend its Temporary Extraordinary Procedures for Correcting Market Design Flaws and Addressing Transitional Abnormalities, until the Northeastern RTO is operational.  The Commission ordered NYISO to narrow the scope of the TEP, and to file tariff sheets doing so within 30 days.  

NYISO proposed virtual bidding procedures (ER01-3009; ER01-3153):  Tariff changes to implement virtual bidding were approved.  The changes would allow market participants to bid non-physical generation and load into the day-ahead market and settle the bids in the real-time market.  Also accepted were NYISOs Market Mitigation Measures to address gaming or market power strategies that might emerge as a result of the virtual bidding.

NYISO - Cost responsibility for new interconnections.  (ER01-2967):  Tariff changes allocating cost responsibility for interconnection facilities.  The provisions allocate to developers 100% of the cost of facilities necessary to physically interconnect the project.  Additionally, developers are allocated the coswts for transmission system upgrades that would not have been made "but for" the interconnection, minus the cost of any facilities that the NYISO's regional plan dictates would have been necessary anyway for load growth and reliability purposes.  

ISO-NE - Interim Bid Caps (ER01-3086):  Commission approved extension of bid caps until the Northeastern RTO is operational.

Calpine v. ISO-NE (EL01-124):  Commission granted complaint by Calpine and Mirant, finding that ISO-NE has amended Market Rule 5 to exclude external contracts from setting the energy clearing price, in violation of a Commission order.

Hello Everyone,

	Well, this week was no doubt a tough week for us all picking the winners. Approximately 10 of the NFL games were won by the underdogs this week. Many people missed the Pittsburgh/Tampa Bay game, also the Carolina/Washington game, Baltimore/Cleveland, New England/Indy game; Atlanta/New Orleans, Denver/San Diego and Green Bay/Minnesota game. Back on Thursday, Buffalo was only picked by one person over Jacksonville. In the college games, just about everyone missed the North Carolina/Clemson game, while the Wisconsin/Illinois and USC/Notre Dame games were missed by about half the people. 

	Through all that, Larry Campbell is the current leader with only 7 wrong, while George Phillips is the only other person still in contention with 8 wrong. Larry picked the Giants tonight with 39 total pts, while George picked the Eagles with 32 total points. Therefore, if the Giants win, Larry will win outright, if the Eagles win and there is 36 or more total pts, then Larry will also win. George will win with a Philly victory and 35 or fewer total points scored. There were 31 entries this week, therefore the prize is $62. 

	There is another Thursday night NFL game this week, therefore we will make this week's picks due Thursday afternoon. I did have a few requests for making each entry $3 this week, to increase the money you could win. Therefore, please email me back if you would like to see the entry fee at $3 instead of $2. If we get more than 20 people who would not mind a $1 increase in the entry fee for a bigger prize, then we will go with it. I do not want to go more than $3 for now. Therefore, if we can keep the 30-35 people each week, the prize will be closer to $100, instead of $60-70 dollars. This is not my idea to have some people give up more money, but just a suggestion I got from a few people. 
Below are the number of games missed by each person this week.

      Napa);
         anyway she was sharing the news that her and Tim are going to be

         a
         baby.  She's about 2 1/2 months preggo right now.  She said things
      have
         gotton really quiet/slow work wise for them but they are thankful
      that
         they
         still have jobs (for now).  Later.

         I just found out that I might have to be in a 4 hour mtg today

   Hey,

   I just got an email from Linda McKula (we went to her wedding in Napa);
   anyway she was sharing the news that her and Tim are going to be having
   a
   baby.  She's about 2 1/2 months preggo right now.  She said things have
   gotton really quiet/slow work wise for them but they are thankful that
   they
   still have jobs (for now).  Later.

   I just found out that I might have to be in a 4 hour mtg today from
   11-3; so
   let me know what your plans are this afternoon via email.

Anyhow, OK if you have a meeting... I'll just stay at Alex's Halloween party
for a little while longer, if you're meeting ends really early you should
walk down to his school, otherwise we'll just look for you at the normal
place...

Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

On October 17, 2001 Rockland Electric Company and PJM filed with FERC a joi=
nt application for the transfer of operational control from the NYISO to PJ=
M of certain facilities located in Northern New Jersey.  The facilities are=
 the transmission assets in the Eastern Division of Rockland's service terr=
itory.  This includes approximately 400 MW of load in Bergen County, NJ and=
 transmission facilities that are already directly interconnected with PJM =
(note that other Rockland facilities located in NJ, namely those in norther=
n Passaic County and Sussex County (Rockland's Central and Western Division=
s respectively) will not be transferred to PJM and will remain under the op=
erational control of the NYISO since these facilities are not directly inte=
rconnected with PJM nor with Rockland's Eastern Division).  The filing requ=
ests approval of the transfer by November 30, 2001 which would allow PJM to=
 take operational control on February 1, 2002 (the filing does not address =
what, if any, changes to the operation date might be if FERC does not appro=
ve this by Nov 30).  Rockland Electric is a subsidiary of Orange & Rockland=
 Utilities which is a subsidiary of Con Edison.

The transfer adds approximately 400 MW of load and 56,000 customers (mostly=
 residential and commercial) to PJM.  There is no increase in supply, there=
fore the total load of PJM is increased by 400 MW without any additional re=
sources.  The transmission assets include 138-kV (8.3 miles), 69-kV (35.9 m=
iles) and 35-kV (12.4 miles) transmission lines and 11 substations (the fil=
ing includes a detailed description of these assets).

Let me know if you require any additional information.

Standardizing Markets, Business, and Other Practices <?xml:namespace prefix=
 =3D o ns =3D "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" />

Panelists for this discussion were:  Sarah Barpoulis, PG&E National Energy =
Group; William P. Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Chr=
istiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC Gene=
ral Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnes=
ota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Co=
mpany.

 General Observations

 The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left l=
ate in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, =
the commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% o=
f all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed;=
 much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seem=
ed very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry f=
orward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover fo=
rward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize th=
at some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed =
to be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was =
discussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take th=
e reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was notice=
able conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two or=
ganizations somewhat common during the discussions.=20

 FERC Deliverables

A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne=
eded from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they =
felt was critical. =20

The first major topic was "How many RTOs?  What is their scope?"  All panel=
ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b=
y FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific langua=
ge, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.

The next topic was, "What will be standard market design?"  Panelists varie=
d on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged f=
or one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid sta=
ndard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (=
followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the curre=
nt situation.

The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha=
t the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic=
 throughout their discussions, asking questions like, "Do we need to issue =
a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?" and, "How much detail do you=
 need us to provide?"   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they =
wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as t=
o say FERC should "Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a=
 little further."  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, bu=
t in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and t=
he need for cautious investigation. =20

One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc=
heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th=
e "RTO Design and RTO Implementation" section would address many of the que=
stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Korm=
os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying =
a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The se=
ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following =
questions:


?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occu=
r, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i=
s nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there=
 be others that must be accommodated?


?         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to sch=
edule ("covered" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protect=
ing from congestion charges (both "covered" and "uncovered" schedules are a=
llowed)?=20


?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission =
services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues=
 to be addressed?


?         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing pr=
ior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to reti=
re those contracts?  Are there other solutions?


?         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function?=
 Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules)=
, be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced sche=
dules), or will they be required at all?


?         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed =
in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary=
 services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as fina=
ncial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?


?         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses? =
 Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce=
ss, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technical=
ly unwieldy?


?         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrate=
d into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that =
non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to t=
reat each NJE as a separate entity?


Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica=
l questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which =
to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions=
, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., "do congestion management") will t=
ake a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., "LMP with financi=
al hedging instruments") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike =
about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible =
to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.

Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) refer=
red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati=
on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out=
 said, "My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't =
believe that that statement is true."  He then backpedaled a bit and said t=
hat it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assert=
ion by the Northwest interests was false.


NERC and GISB


A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-se=
tting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, "Are we looking at a bea=
uty contest between NERC and GISB?"  Cook and Boswell then went into severa=
l short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants cont=
inually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interesting=
ly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI=
SB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the "new" structure of NERC and=
 did not focus on its history.

Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a=
sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were=
 they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily a=
ble to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin=
g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Poin=
t, Brownell.

Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-m=
an.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's suppos=
ed "successes," such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will =
likely remember that these "successes" have not been so successful, resulti=
ng in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments=
 in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show=
 the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.

There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues=
, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some =
talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.

The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly ur=
ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade=
rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC s=
omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would=
 say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Private Investors Align to Upgrade California's Path 15;=20
Project Causes New State / Federal Conflicts=20
By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis=20

[IMAGE]
[News item from Reuters] The federal government has reached a deal with a c=
oalition of energy companies to build a transmission line in central Califo=
rnia under a $300-million project to relieve a chronic bottleneck in moving=
 electricity supplies between the northern and southern parts of the state.=
 Construction on the so-called Path 15 project, which was announced by Ener=
gy Secretary Spencer Abraham, will begin in the spring of 2003 and could be=
 completed by as early as summer 2004. =20
Analysis: The California energy crisis, which clearly subsided over the sum=
mer of 2001 due to new generation that came online in the state, mild weath=
er patterns and conservation efforts, is generally considered the result of=
 a severe supply / demand imbalance. While this may be true, what often get=
s overlooked is that deficient transmission capacity in the state-the lines=
 that actually transport power from point A to point B-also played a primar=
y role in creating the tremendous instability of California's energy market=
. This problem still persists today, and as California heads into the winte=
r season concerns about power reliability once again are surfacing. The Dep=
artment of Energy (DOE) has stepped in to correct the problem by overseeing=
 a massive upgrade to California's main transmission line. While this is a =
positive step, the upgrade creates a new level of state / federal disputes =
for California and also puts ownership of the new transmission line into th=
e hands of private companies, which creates a whole new set of potential co=
nflicts.=20
Amid a long list of uncertain ramifications of the Path 15 upgrade, there a=
re some things that we know for sure. First, Path 15, which is owned by Pac=
ific Gas & Electric Co., is a 90-mile high-voltage section of transmission =
capacity that essentially carries power between Northern and Southern Calif=
ornia. During the peak of the energy crisis in California, Path 15 became r=
ather clogged and suffered from bottlenecks (points at which transmission c=
ould not transport high volumes of power). This pre-empted any transport of=
 power from Southern California (and Arizona and Mexico) to the north, whic=
h resulted in rolling blackouts in San Francisco and other Northern Califor=
nia cities. As noted, these bottleneck problems remain and are particularly=
 acute during times of peak power demand, which is obviously a concern as w=
inter approaches. =20
The deficiency of the California transmission systems is arguably the last =
piece of the puzzle that remains toward bringing stability back to the stat=
e's energy market. Ironically, power supply is no longer seen as an imminen=
t problem. New reports from the California ISO indicate that the state shou=
ld have operating reserves of between 2,000 and 2,200 MW this winter, which=
 has been deemed sufficient to stave off problems that plagued the previous=
 winter season. However, the report on the state's transmission system is n=
ot as positive. If the Northwest continues to experience a drought, then No=
rthern California will still need to import more power from the south. Heav=
y dependence on the strained Path 15 could once again cause reliability pro=
blems for California.=20
Thus, deficiencies along Path 15 can be seen as a symptom of larger problem=
s that continue to plague California, and problems that have been the focus=
 of both state and federal intervention for months, if not years. In fact, =
there is a history here that is worth noting, especially as it relates to f=
ederal / state jurisdiction. When President Bush released his national ener=
gy plan in April of this year, he directed the DOE to explore efforts that =
would relieve congestion along Path 15. Following through with this order, =
Energy Secretary Abraham issued a request for proposals that elicited respo=
nses from 13 companies interested in participating in the expansion of Path=
 15. The current contract, which will add a new line to the existing Path 1=
5, is the result of that previous directive.=20
At present, it appears that PG?Corp. (NYSE: PCG), the parent of Pacific Gas=
 & Electric Co., and six other companies have signed on to financially supp=
ort the upgrade. The six other companies that will spearhead the project ar=
e the Transmission Agency of Northern California, Trans-Elect, Inc., Kinder=
 Morgan Power Co., PG?National Energy Group, Williams Energy Marketing and =
Trading, and the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA), a federal agency=
 within the DOE that sells electricity from water projects in 15 western st=
ates and operates 17,000 miles of transmission lines. =20
Presently, Path 15 connects the Bay Area in Northern California to two of t=
he state's largest generation facilities-Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s Diabl=
o Canyon nuclear facility and Duke Energy's Morro Bay natural-gas power pla=
nt. The upgrade will reportedly include a new 500-kilovolt line that would =
boost transmission by about 1,500 MW from these two plants. Further, when t=
he upgrade is finished in 2004, Path 15 should be able to carry a total of =
5,400 MW of power.=20
Of course, the first question that I asked was: Who is going to pay for the=
 upgrade? The way it appears at this writing is that the WAPA will retain 1=
0-percent ownership of the new line for its role as project manager and for=
 acquiring the rights from property owners to hold the power line. The rema=
ining 90 percent will be owned by the private companies that are devoting d=
ifferent amounts of capital to fund the upgrade. The exact percentages of i=
nvestment (and ownership) have yet to be defined, but should be revealed in=
 a subsequent plan outlined in the next 90 days. You may ask why these comp=
anies would want to participate in a transmission upgrade in California. Th=
e answer is that the companies will be able to recoup their investments thr=
ough fees charged to use the new transmission line. This could result in a =
hefty payoff for the companies investing in the project, who presumably ant=
icipate that California will remain a high-demand state through which huge =
amounts of power will need to be transported.=20
As I mentioned, there are some potential conflicts that might arise with th=
is upgrade plan. First, there is the issue of potential state / federal reg=
ulatory conflicts. Presently, state governments have jurisdiction over powe=
r line siting. Thus, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) had =
already been pursuing its own upgrade plan for Path 15 prior to Secretary A=
braham's call for private-company bids. Specifically, the CPUC had directed=
 Pacific Gas & Electric Co., which it regulates, to upgrade the bottleneck =
spots along Path 15. As seems to be a growing occurrence, we may find that =
there is a state / federal jurisdictional dispute regarding which regulator=
y body has the authority to direct and manage transmission upgrades in Cali=
fornia. Gov. Gray Davis and the CPUC certainly seem to believe that it is t=
he state's prerogative, and have issued strong criticisms over the DOE's ve=
nture into this territory. However, in his energy plan, President Bush seem=
ed to support a change in policy that would allow federal officials to obta=
in transmission rights of way as a way to increase national transmission ca=
pacity.  If there is indeed a dispute between the CPUC and the DOE, it is n=
ot known if federal policy would supersede state policy in this area. In an=
y event, representatives from Trans-Elect, one of the participating compani=
es, have said that balancing the various interests among federal and state =
(and public and private) interests will be one of the key challenges for th=
e upgrade project. Note that Trans-Elect was the company that had unsuccess=
fully attempted to purchase the transmission assets of Southern California =
Edison earlier this year.  =20
Also viewed by some as a potential conflict with the DOE's upgrade plan for=
 Path 15 are the difficulties that could arise with private ownership of a =
major piece of California's transmission grid. The DOE-sponsored upgrade, u=
nlike the one that the CPUC has directed, reportedly would not be subject t=
o review or approval by either the California ISO or the CPUC. Further, bec=
ause the companies participating in the upgrade will own a portion of the n=
ew line, these companies will be able to charge "tolls" to the power market=
ers that use the lines to transport power. This is most likely a point of c=
ontention for California officials, especially Gov. Gray Davis, who has sou=
ght state ownership of existing transmission lines and is not too keen on p=
rivate-company ownership of generation facilities in the state. The positiv=
e side of this issue is that, according to the DOE, the bids from private c=
ontracts enable the upgrade of Path 15 to proceed without any increase to "=
either the taxpayers or ratepayers of California or the United States of Am=
erica."=20
As a side note, in addition to Path 15 the CPUC is also proceeding with a n=
ew transmission line in Southern California, known as the Valley-Rainbow In=
terconnect transmission line. Although the timetable has been delayed until=
 2005, San Diego Gas & Electric is proceeding with a 500,000-volt transmiss=
ion line that would connect Southern California Edison's Valley Substation =
near Romoland, Calif., with a future substation to be located in the Rainbo=
w, Calif. area, just south of the Riverside-San Diego county line. The new =
transmission line would provide a second interconnection between SDG&E's an=
d SCE's transmission systems. The first interconnection is at the San Onofr=
e Substation near San Clemente, Calif. The project is designed to deliver a=
pproximately 1,000 MW. =20
Moreover, the expansion of Path 15 is a necessary step to help California l=
ower its risk for further reliability problems. Due to generation developme=
nt, the imminent threat of the California energy crisis has diminished, but=
 the state is still wrestling with an equally important mix of risk factors=
. The state government still has its hand in power purchases, which represe=
nts a huge part of the state's energy market. The state has accrued $12.5 b=
illion in debt to buy power for the state's utilities, the recovery for whi=
ch remains an unresolved issue. While Gov. Davis has preferred to increase =
the state's role in California's energy infrastructure, this new DOE-sponso=
red project on Path 15 puts ownership of transmission assets into the hands=
 of private companies. =20

Dynegy vs. Enron:
A "Tale of Two Companies" =20
By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis=20

[IMAGE]
Facts: Dynegy Inc. (NYSE: DYN) beat expectations in the third quarter, repo=
rting that its earnings rose to $286 million, or 85 cents per diluted share=
, from $177 million, or 55 cents per diluted share, for the same period in =
2000. This represented a 22-percent increase from 3Q 2000 and boosted the c=
ompany's 2001 earnings estimate. Dynegy has a market capitalization of $14.=
5 billion. Its stock is currently trading at about $43 down from a 52-week =
high of $59, although it is important to note that for year-end 2000 the co=
mpany's stock was one of the top performers among Standard & Poor's 500 com=
panies with a total shareholder return of 218 percent. Dynegy employs 5,778=
 people. =20
Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE) reported $638 million in losses for the third quart=
er, after taking $1.01 billion in charges associated with several of its no=
n-core businesses. The company's 3Q recurring net income (before the write-=
offs) increased 35 percent to $393 million, or 43 cents a diluted share, an=
d revenue in the quarter rose to $47.6 billion from $30 billion in 3Q 2000.=
 Enron has a market capitalization of $14.8 billion. Its stock is currently=
 trading at about $16.0, which represents a six-year low for the company an=
d is considerably lower than the peak of $82 hit in August 2000. Enron empl=
oys 20,600 people. =20
Analysis: Dynegy closed out a banner year in 2000 and appears to still be o=
n a roll in terms of its financial performance. In contrast, Enron faced an=
 unprecedented year of turmoil, and is presently languishing in a low ebb, =
characterized by a strategic crossroads and heightened scrutiny of the comp=
any's financial reporting. While the two companies operate in the same mark=
et space of power trading and are fierce competitors, Dynegy-ironically the=
 younger and smaller of the two companies-is an industry success story whil=
e Enron's status remains rather uncertain. The questions to be addressed in=
 this article are: What is Dynegy doing "right"? What is Enron doing "wrong=
"? What lessons can other power and natural-gas marketers learn from this "=
tale of two companies"?=20
Although they are often referred to as "cross-town rivals," Dynegy and Enro=
n are worlds apart in terms of their competitive positions. Their divergent=
 approaches to the global marketplace illustrate what could be the single-m=
ost important element related to their disparate positions at the end of 20=
01. Put more simply, the two companies have vastly different strategies, an=
d-hindsight being 20/20-a strong argument can be made that Dynegy's strateg=
y is the winner at this juncture. Throughout this article, I will focus on =
two key areas in which Dynegy and Enron differ dramatically. Those two key =
areas are the ownership of physical generation assets and the extent to whi=
ch the companies have expanded (and invested) into non-core sectors.=20
Both companies started out as natural-gas companies and converged into the =
power market in the 1990s. However, that is essentially where their similar=
ities end, and over the last few years Enron and Dynegy have followed decid=
edly different paths. In an attempt to make the complex rather rudimentary,=
 let me summarize the two paths this way: Enron does not believe it needs t=
o own physical assets to be a success in the power and natural-gas trading =
sector; Dynegy, on the other hand, not only believes in the ownership of ph=
ysical assets, but has set a goal that could ultimately establish the compa=
ny as owning one of the largest generation arsenals in the industry. =20
Let's look at the companies separately. We'll discuss Enron first since it =
is the older of the two. Enron readily admits that its strategy is difficul=
t to define, but a close approximation is that Enron literally creates comm=
odity markets so that it can deliver physical commodities to customers. The=
 participation and success in commodity markets, according to Enron, does n=
ot necessitate ownership of physical assets. In fact, the company has routi=
nely sold physical assets that are not considered to be strategic to its wh=
olesale business. Rather, Enron has concentrated on developing a new philos=
ophy of risk management excellence, in which it will merely buy and sell th=
e commodities it needs to participate in trading venues. =20
As an example, Enron bought Portland General (which owns 2,000 MW of genera=
tion and 41,600 kilometers of electric T?lines) in 1996 as a way to launch =
its penetration of the West Coast power markets. When competition fizzled i=
n that region, Enron put Portland General back on the sales block (a sale o=
f Portland General to Northwest Natural is pending at this writing). Likewi=
se in Europe, where it is one of the most prominent trading companies, Enro=
n has disposed of generation assets such as Sutton Bridge in England and, u=
nlike other U.S. competitors, has refrained from buying additional generati=
ng units in opening countries such as Germany and Italy. According to its m=
ost recent 10K report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, En=
ron owns or controls 2,015 MW of generating capacity (including joint owner=
ships), which is drastically lower than the average among other companies o=
perating in the power trading sector. =20
Dynegy's approach to the market is crystal clear and radically different fr=
om Enron's. In the words of CEO Chuck Watson, "Dynegy's long-term strategy =
is to focus on marketing and trading around physical assets, which supports=
 earnings sustainability." Ever since going public in 1995, Dynegy has been=
 on an acquisition binge, with each purchase significantly increasing its g=
eneration capability. Dynegy presently owns or controls about 27,000 MW of =
generating capacity in the United States, 26 gas-processing plants and 14,0=
00 miles of pipelines, which are located in geographically competitive area=
s. The company's goal is to own or control 70,000 MW, or 10 percent of the =
U.S. market, within the next five years. Sometimes, Dynegy has acquired ass=
ets through partnerships with other companies such as NRG Energy, but just =
as often it has purchased assets independently. Most notably, when Dynegy a=
cquired Illinova in early 2000, the purchase doubled Dynegy's generating ca=
pacity. Dynegy is now attempting to replicate this approach in Europe, wher=
e it is presently planning to purchase natural-gas storage facilities in En=
gland. Dynegy executives have argued that natural-gas storage is the best w=
ay to back up a natural-gas trading operation. There's no question that the=
 approach is working. Out of the $286 million that Dynegy reported in the t=
hird quarter, $263 million of it came from the company's main wholesale bus=
iness. =20
The issue of asset ownership is probably the central defining difference be=
tween Enron and Dynegy, and its significance should not be overlooked. It i=
s not difficult to make a case that supports Dynegy's approach. Owning phys=
ical assets often enables a trading company to gain information in the cour=
se of operating power plants that can help the company to gauge markets and=
 anticipate small changes in price. In other words, by controlling the actu=
al output of generation instead of just being involved in buys and sells, a=
 trader such as Dynegy will theoretically know what the load is going to be=
 in a particular region, how much power can be produced to meet that load a=
nd when shortages might occur. In addition, in markets that are short on in=
frastructure, it may be difficult for a trader to participate in the market=
 unless they actually have ownership of physical assets in the region. By t=
he same token, those companies that do control physical assets often have g=
reater communication with grid operators, and possible insight to spreads (=
the difference between various energy prices). In fact, Dynegy's CEO Watson=
 fully acknowledges that his company excels at being able to trade around t=
he volatility of price, and being capable of resolving balances when shorta=
ges exist. This may be more difficult for a company such as Enron to accomp=
lish when it has no physical generation of its own to meet discrepancies in=
 power bids. Dynegy's strategy of acquiring both natural-gas pipelines and =
power plants also gives it the flexibility to trade on both commodities.=20
On the other side of this argument, a case could be made that Enron's appro=
ach provides more flexibility in reacting to trading volatility. Certainly,=
 by investing less in power generation facilities, Enron has less capital o=
n the line when compared to a company like Dynegy. Under a scenario when ma=
rket prices suddenly drop, a company such as Enron that does not have heavy=
 capital invested in power generation could actually fare better than an as=
set-laden company because Enron does not face the pressure to meet the fixe=
d payments of a generation facility. Asset-heavy companies also may find th=
at their earnings could be impacted by the investment in generation facilit=
ies in times of extreme price volatility. As the industry becomes increasin=
gly focused on bottom-line results, this could be seen as a potential conce=
rn for investors. Further, some would argue that Enron's approach of establ=
ishing purchasing contracts with various parties to meet its buy and sell r=
equirements is the rough equivalent of owning a generation facility. What E=
nron gains by this approach is the presumed flexibility it has by not being=
 tied down to a specific generation unit and being able to build its own po=
rtfolio.=20
Consequently, the issue of asset ownership can perhaps be considered the "g=
reat debate" among power traders. However, although Dynegy's overall perfor=
mance in the third quarter was better than Enron's, that does not necessari=
ly provide a clear endorsement of Dynegy's strategy toward acquiring new ge=
neration facilities. Keep in mind that Enron's 3Q losses resulted primarily=
 from non-recurring charges related to its non-core businesses (broadband a=
nd water in particular). Without these charges, Enron's core wholesale trad=
ing business continues to perform well. This is a point that CEO Ken Lay ha=
s been quick to reiterate to investors. "Our 26-percent increase in recurri=
ng earnings per diluted share shows the very strong results of our core who=
lesale and retail energy businesses and our natural-gas pipelines," Lay sai=
d. "The continued excellent prospects in these businesses and Enron's leadi=
ng market position make us very confident in our strong earnings outlook."=
=20
Moreover, perhaps even more than ownership of physical assets, the key issu=
e that played a role in the current disparity between Dynegy and Enron earn=
ings in the third quarter is the companies' approach to developing new line=
s of business.  Telecom is a perfect example to illustrate the point. Enron=
, which prides itself as usually gaining a first-strike advantage, plunged =
into the telecom sector well ahead of other energy companies. Under the lea=
dership of then-CEO Jeffrey Skilling, Enron sunk large sums of capital into=
 purchasing broadband capacity on the expectation that the market would qui=
ckly become lucrative. Now Lay admits that the company "could have gotten i=
nto the broadband business with less capital" and that Enron "spent too muc=
h too soon" in this sector. Nevertheless, Enron recorded an $80-million non=
-recurring write-down for restructuring its broadband unit in the third qua=
rter and is presently attempting to stop the bleeding in this sector by red=
ucing future costs in this sector to $40 million a quarter. =20
Dynegy took a much more cautious approach toward expanding into the telecom=
 sector and made a comparatively small amount of investment when compared t=
o Enron. Dynegy has likewise been impacted by the slowdown of the telecom s=
ector, but in the third quarter took a $15-million loss in its broadband bu=
siness compared to the $80-million loss that Enron reported. However, Dyneg=
y clearly specializes in marketing and trading two commodities (electricity=
 and natural gas) and seems to add other businesses in a very methodical wa=
y that merely supplements its core business.=20
It is also important to note that Enron gained the first-strike advantage w=
hen it developed EnronOnline, an electronic trading exchange. In fact, Enro=
n was the first to create such an exchange in the energy space, well ahead =
of its competitors. Dynegy later followed this trend with creating Dynegydi=
rect. The two exchanges are different in terms of their trading standards, =
but it is important to acknowledge that in this particular case Enron was s=
uccessful in launching into the electronic trading space well ahead of its =
competitors. The latest available information indicates that EnronOnline ha=
s recorded transactions that exceed $590 in notional value. Since its incep=
tion in November 2000, Dynegydirect has recorded $33 billion in notional tr=
ansactions. =20
At this juncture, Dynegy and Enron are very different with regard to their =
approaches toward financial reporting. Enron, which has often been accused =
of not providing a balance sheet to investors, is currently struggling from=
 a serious image problem as the Securities and Exchange Commission pursues =
an investigation of possible mishandling of funds by Enron's CFO. To my rec=
ollection, no one has ever accused Dynegy of not providing a balance sheet,=
 and thus the company's status with investors is arguably more solid. As I =
don't expect either company to radically alter its competitive strategy any=
 time soon, my projection is that (at least in the near term), we will cont=
inue to see a wide disparity in Wall Street performance between Dynegy and =
Enron. That is not to say that anyone should count Enron out of the game. A=
s noted, the company's core business of wholesale business remains strong, =
but clearly has been tainted by the impact of other non-core businesses. Th=
at doesn't mean Enron is down permanently, but it will have to find a way t=
o strike a better balance between the businesses that it does best and thos=
e businesses that former CEO Jeffrey Skilling believed were advantageous.=
=20
In many ways, the comparison between Dynegy and Enron is rather like the to=
rtoise and the hare parable. I am sure you can guess which company is the t=
ortoise and which is the hare in this analogy. The race between the two is =
far from over, although Dynegy is taking the lead at this point, based on i=
ts more methodical approach. What will be fascinating to observe is how bot=
h companies continue to adapt to changes in the marketplace and possibly mo=
dify what up to this point have been adamantly espoused philosophies. =20

Dumbest Things on Wall Street This Week [IMAGE] By K.C. Swanson  Staff  Rep=
orter 10/19/2001 06:59 AM  EDT  1. Bayer Fighting the Bears?  One beneficia=
ry of the anthrax scare has been Bayer AG (BAYZY :OTC  BB ADR - news  - com=
mentary   - research   - analysis) ,  the German chemical maker, which has =
seen its share price gain 10.4% since  the terrorist attacks. But investors=
 bidding up the stock might be getting  ahead of themselves.    Bayer makes=
 Cipro, a leading treatment for anthrax. But while the demand for Cipro is =
high, sales from the drug are only a small portion of  the company's overal=
l revenue, which totaled 30.9 billion euros last year  (and, according to a=
nalysts, will increase even more this year, due to its  acquisition of Aven=
tis CropScience, a crop protection and production company). To put the dema=
nd for Cipro in context, J.P. Morgan expects U.S.  sales of the drug to be =
approximately 1.2 billion euros for 2001.     [IMAGE] [IMAGE]border=3D0 hei=
ght=3D"280" width=3D"336">   [IMAGE]  Even emergency purchases of Cipro  pr=
obably won't add that much to Bayer's overall revenues. The president  has =
asked for $643 million for antibiotics to combat bioterrorist attacks.  Whi=
le it's possible that sum will be increased, not all the money would be  sp=
ent on Cipro.    Besides, it's not even clear that Bayer will remain the on=
ly producer  of Cipro. Though the company holds the patent for the drug, th=
ere's some  pressure in Congress for the government to purchase a generic v=
ersion from  other manufacturers.    On another front, Bayer is currently b=
attling a class-action lawsuit  related to an anti-cholesterol drug implica=
ted in a number of deaths. It  was forced to withdraw the drug from the mar=
ket.    Bayer may offer protection against anthrax, but that doesn't mean i=
t's  a refuge for investors.    2. Losses at Twice the Price  You know thin=
gs are bad for a company when its losses per share are  double the price of=
 the shares themselves. That's the case for i2 Technologies (ITWO :Nasdaq  =
- news  -  commentary   - research   - analysis) ,  the supply-chain softwa=
re maker. After market close on Tuesday, the company posted   losses under =
generally accepted accounting principles that amounted to  $5.5 billion, or=
 $13.25 per share, for the latest quarter, including all  charges.    In ot=
her words, i2's losses were more than twice the value of its share  price, =
which closed at $5.69 before the announcement.    Much of the huge writedow=
n reflects amortized goodwill from the  purchase of Aspect Development in M=
arch 2000.    To be fair, investors in companies that have made big acquisi=
tions like  i2 typically focus on pro forma earnings, which exclude charges=
 and extraordinary items. By that measure, i2's losses didn't look quite so=
  bad: The company met analysts' consensus expectations with a loss of $55.=
3  million, or 13 cents per share.    Still, investors met i2's earnings wi=
th disapproval, knocking the stock  down 25% the day after they were report=
ed.    3. Microsoft's Bag of Tricks  In times like these, there's comfort i=
n knowing business goes on as  usual at many U.S. companies. Just like the =
old days, Microsoft (MSFT :Nasdaq  - news  -  commentary   - research   - a=
nalysis)   is in the hot seat for its sharklike behavior toward a competito=
r.    It stands accused of sending 3,000 fake cereal boxes emblazoned with =
 the words "Microsoft Server Crunch" to customers of rival server software =
 maker Novell. The boxes, according to Novell, contained "a number of false=
  and misleading statements" intended as putdowns of Novell products.   Amo=
ng the attempted insults were some not-so-clever plays on packaged  food. F=
or example, in a reference to Novell's flagship software product, a  line o=
n the Microsoft boxes read: "What's the expiration date on that NetWare pla=
tform?" (A round of applause, please, for those gut-splittingly  funny engi=
neers.)    The boxes also said Novell is shifting its focus from software t=
o consulting services, which Novell says isn't true.    Microsoft spokesman=
 Jim Desler said the cereal boxes were primarily  intended to advertise Mic=
rosoft services, not to slight Novell. "It was  all in the theme of a mock =
cereal box," he said. "It was a modest  campaign."    In response to Novell=
's complaints, he says Microsoft sent out a letter  in September to recipie=
nts of the boxes to clarify some of its statements,  and it's just agreed t=
o send another letter to appease the company. For  the record, Novell said =
it's not calling off its lawsuit for unspecified  money damages.    4. AMD'=
s Feisty Pledge  CEOs don't get their jobs by being eloquent, and it probab=
ly would be  too much to expect them to sound statesmanlike. But sometimes =
their oratorical rough edges cross the line into embarrassing.    Case in p=
oint: Comments from Jerry Sanders, the CEO of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD :=
NYSE  - news  -  commentary   - research   - analysis) ,  which earlier thi=
s week reported a loss for the first time in almost three  years. The compa=
ny, facing harsh pricing competition from Intel (INTC :Nasdaq  - news  -  c=
ommentary   - research   - analysis) ,  said its revenue was down 22% from =
a year ago and it expects a likely operating loss for the fourth quarter.  =
  Given recent declines in consumer confidence, the downturn is likely to  =
be extended by several quarters, Sanders admitted. But in a conference  cal=
l, he indulged in some spirited fist-shaking. Citing the company's so-calle=
d "Hammer" architecture for processors, Sanders declared, "We feel  that wh=
en the upturn comes, we're going to kick ---."    Does this guy carry aroun=
d a surfboard in his car or what? Mr. Sanders,  meet Mr. Reeves .    OK, so=
 we actually kind of admire Sanders' never-capitulate spirit. But  his comm=
ent seems a little redundant, because just about everybody will  look bette=
r when the economy turns around. Because that may not be anytime  soon, wha=
t matters is how companies weather the interim -- feisty pledges  notwithst=
anding.    5. Enron's Rabbit-From-a-Hat Style  Analysts have complained for=
 some time about Enron's (ENE :NYSE  - news  -  commentary   - research   -=
 analysis)   rabbit-from-a-hat style accounting, with which the company pro=
duced results that wowed investors without making it quite clear where they=
 came  from. Now that its business has taken a sour turn, that tendency has=
 gotten even more unsettling.    To cap off its disappointing earnings resu=
lts this week -- Enron posted  a steep loss after taking a $1.01 billion ch=
arge -- the company let drop  that its shareholder equity had decreased by =
$1.2 billion.    In a conference call, CEO Kenneth Lay attributed the reduc=
tion in equity to the "removal of an obligation to issue a number of shares=
." According to a report in The Wall Street Journal, Enron repurchased  55 =
million shares issued through a series of transactions involving LJM  Capit=
al, a partnership that until recently was headed up by Enron's CFO.    TSC'=
s Peter Eavis has written   that it appears Enron lent LJM money to buy Enr=
on stock.    Ironically, the company boasted in its earnings release this w=
eek that  it had expanded reporting of its financial results, presumably to=
 quiet  its accounting critics.    Enron's transactions have been so labyri=
nthine that it's hard to identify exactly if or how they were inappropriate=
. But the latest  revelation, to say the least, does nothing to bolster the=
 company's credibility. Enron, whose CEO resigned unexpectedly in August, h=
ad seen  its stock fall 59% for the year leading up to its latest earnings =
release.  Since then, it's dropped another 12.6%     Read our conflicts and=

Effective Monday, October 22, 2001 the following changes will be made to the Autohedge functionality on EnronOnline.

The volume on the hedge will now respect the minimum volume and volume increment settings on the parent product. See rules below: 

?	If the transaction volume on the child is less than half of the parent's minimum volume no hedge will occur.
?	If the transaction volume on the child is more than half the parent's minimum volume but less than half the volume increment on the parent, the hedge will volume will be the parent's minimum volume.
?	For all other volumes, the same rounding rules will apply based on the volume increment on the parent product.

Please see example below:

Parent's Settings:
Minimum: 	5000
Increment:  1000

Volume on Autohedge transaction			Volume Hedged
1      - 2499							0
2500 - 5499							5000
5500 - 6499							6000

> Enron Said To Be Takeover Target, Shell Tipped As Possible Bidder
> Oct. 28 (Power Finance & Risk)
> Enron, which 12 months ago was the darling of the energy markets, has
> become increasingly vulnerable to a takeover bid following the recent
> collapse of its share price, according to bankers and analysts. Royal
> Dutch/Shell is one likely bidder, they say, noting that Enron's relatively
> modest market capitalization--down to $11.5 billion late last week from a
> high of more than $55 billion--means that Shell and other potential
> acquirers would have little trouble digesting it whole. Cerris Tavinor, a
> spokeswoman for Shell, declined to comment. Calls to Enron were not
> returned.
> An M&A banker in London says the Anglo-Dutch oil giant was rumored to have
> approached Enron unsuccessfully in August. An analyst in New York adds
> Shell has courted Enron for more than three years. "[Shell]'s downstream
> power business InterGen has not been as successful as it and its partner
> Bechtel hoped, especially in the U.S., and this would be a great fit," he
> continues.
> While many energy concerns would love to get their hands on Enron's hugely
> successful gas and electricity trading business, its forays into water,
> broadband and pulp and paper, might prove less attractive. Bidders may
> want to cherry pick the best parts of the business, reasons Peter Fusaro,
> president of Global Change Associates in New York. Still, he says "there
> is a distinct possibility that it could be bought outright."
> Another obstacle to any sale is believed to be CEO Kenneth Lay's
> unwillingness to sell the company at such a low stock price. Still, Lay
> has already given up the executive reins once, and at 61, he would
> probably be willing to sell if the premium was significantly rich, argues
> one New York based banker. Another adds that Lay will probably wait for
> the share price to recover before he would even consider talking to
> bidders.
> Bankers argue that potential bidders would be unwilling to ride roughshod
> over Lay's wishes through a hostile bid as most of Enron's value is tied
> up in intellectual capital. Hostile bidders run the risk that senior staff
> will jump ship, argues a London banker.
> Another obstacle to any bid is concern that Enron may have additional
> skeletons in its financial closet. Last week's stock market selloff was
> prompted by Enron unexpectedly writing off some $1.2 billion in equity
> resulting from the termination of contracts with a special purpose vehicle
> linked to Peter Fastow, cfo. Analysts fear that Enron may have to
> terminate similar contracts over the next quarters.

Calpine Eastern Corporation, Mirant Americas Energy Marketing, L.P., Mirant New
England, LLC, Mirant Kendall, LLC, and Mirant Canal, LLC filed a complaint against ISO New England
with respect to its unilateral modification of Market Rule 5 and Appendix 5-C of the
New England Power Pool (NEPOOL) FERC Electric Rate Schedule No. 6, through which ISO-NE has excluded external energy contracts from its calculation of the Energy Clearing Price since September 1, 2001.
Interventions in this proceeding are due this week; please let me know immediately whether we have a specific interest.  In any event, I will circulate an update of any FERC action on the complaint.

   Hey,

   I just got an email from Linda McKula (we went to her wedding in Napa);
   anyway she was sharing the news that her and Tim are going to be having
   a
   baby.  She's about 2 1/2 months preggo right now.  She said things have
   gotton really quiet/slow work wise for them but they are thankful that
   they
   still have jobs (for now).  Later.

   I just found out that I might have to be in a 4 hour mtg today from
   11-3; so
   let me know what your plans are this afternoon via email.

RTO Week

 <?xml:namespace prefix =3D o ns =3D "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:offi=

Day 4 - October 18, 2001

Afternoon Session

=20

Standardizing Markets, Business, and Other Practices=20

Panelists for this discussion were:  Sarah Barpoulis, PG&E National Energy =
Group; William P. Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Chr=
istiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC Gene=
ral Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnes=
ota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Co=
mpany.

General Observations


=20

The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left la=
te in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, t=
he commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of=
 all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed; =
much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seeme=
d very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry fo=
rward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover for=
ward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize tha=
t some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed t=
o be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was d=
iscussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the=
 reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was noticea=
ble conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two org=
anizations somewhat common during the discussions.=20

=20


FERC Deliverables


A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne=
eded from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they =
felt was critical. =20

The first major topic was "How many RTOs?  What is their scope?"  All panel=
ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b=
y FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific langua=
ge, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.

The next topic was, "What will be standard market design?"  Panelists varie=
d on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged f=
or one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid sta=
ndard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (=
followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the curre=
nt situation.

The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha=
t the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic=
 throughout their discussions, asking questions like, "Do we need to issue =
a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?" and, "How much detail do you=
 need us to provide?"   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they =
wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as t=
o say FERC should "Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a=
 little further."  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, bu=
t in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and t=
he need for cautious investigation. =20

One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc=
heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th=
e "RTO Design and RTO Implementation" section would address many of the que=
stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Korm=
os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying =
a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The se=
ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following =
questions:


?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occu=
r, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i=
s nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there=
 be others that must be accommodated?


?         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to sch=
edule ("covered" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protect=
ing from congestion charges (both "covered" and "uncovered" schedules are a=
llowed)?=20


?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission =
services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues=
 to be addressed?


?         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing pr=
ior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to reti=
re those contracts?  Are there other solutions?


?         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function?=
 Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules)=
, be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced sche=
dules), or will they be required at all?


?         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed =
in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary=
 services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as fina=
ncial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?


?         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses? =
 Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce=
ss, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technical=
ly unwieldy?


?         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrate=
d into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that =
non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to t=
reat each NJE as a separate entity?


Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica=
l questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which =
to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions=
, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., "do congestion management") will t=
ake a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., "LMP with financi=
al hedging instruments") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike =
about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible =
to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.

Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) refer=
red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati=
on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out=
 said, "My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't =
believe that that statement is true."  He then backpedaled a bit and said t=

NERC and GISB


A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-se=
tting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, "Are we looking at a bea=
uty contest between NERC and GISB?"  Cook and Boswell then went into severa=
l short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants cont=
inually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interesting=
ly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI=
SB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the "new" structure of NERC and=
 did not focus on its history.

Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a=
sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were=
 they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily a=
ble to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin=
g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Poin=
t, Brownell.

Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-m=
an.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's suppos=
ed "successes," such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will =
likely remember that these "successes" have not been so successful, resulti=
ng in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments=
 in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show=
 the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.

There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues=
, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some =
talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.

The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly ur=
ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade=
rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC s=
omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would=
 say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thursday Morning session----Meeting with State Commissioners


This session was generally known to be the occasion for state commissioners to vent their frustrations at FERC taking action without including them in the decision making process.  Although the panel notice showed that 5 state commissioners would attend, upon arriving in the hearing room we found that 27 state commissioners were there and ready to claim their 15 minutes of fame.  It was a long morning!  I will include comments or highlights from some of the commissioners below as well as some general thoughts. 

Approximately 35 to 40% of the commenters were supportive of FERC and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts.  Most of these comments came from the Midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support.  Everyone else was fairly verbal against FERC, primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process, that FERC was moving too quickly, and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens.  In particular, the commissioners from Maryland and North Carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric. While many would think that the session was extremely negative (our friend Sarah Novosel thought it was disgusting!) in my mind it was similiar to a legislative hearing--allowing alot of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis.

Here's some individual comments:

Catherine Riley/Maryland---she started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the MAryland commission and immediately implied that FERC was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens (she was way overboard in the dramatics department).  She then stated that she was not at the meeting to "help you (FERC) backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record".  It went on like this for about 15 minutes.  The good part is that she was so personally negative, that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against her.

Sam Ervin/NOrth Carolina---he was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens, that customer choice is never coming to his state, so he will never benefit from an RTO, that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an RTO (and I bet if they do, he'll work to change the statutes!) and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of FERC. His comments were also pretty brutal, but sugar coated just a bit with southern humor.

Arnetta McRae/Delware---she kept on saying "show me" where the benefits for consumers are.  She also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the order.  

Rory McMinn/New Mexico---repeatedly talked about how the west was different, how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers, how the FERC commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they were. 

Carl Wood/California--tried to portray himself and California as representing the west as a whole, and even brought along a statement from the Washington commission echoeing his comments. He delivered the same messages that we've been hearing forever---FERC should have acted sooner on price caps, etc etc.

Glen Thomas/Pennsylvania---he was the first positive commenter and talked about how his state has taken great strides to bring it's energy system into the new century...that by opening it's markets they have had an explosion in green power, they have reduced costs all across the state, etc. He was very supportive of PJM (makes sense because it's in his back yard) and stated that for any RTO to be effective it must have independent governance.  

Judy Jones/Ohio---was very parochial in her discussion, but echoed Don Svanda's comments from earlier in the week that one RTO for the midwest was necessary and encouraged the FERC to make a decision and get on with it so that regulatory uncertainty would be removed.

Ed GArvey/Minnesota---he got the gold star for the day.  After very very lengthly comments from about 15 commissioners, he took about 1 minute and said "FERC--just get it done"....in essence telling them to go ahead with what they are doing and move forward.

Other Commissioners who talked were:  Arthur/Connecticut, Hadley/Indiana, Huelsman/Kentucky, Nugent/ Maine  all on the positive side.  Other negative commentors were two guys from DC and Jim Irvin from Arizona who had a rambling conversation that never really pinpointed what he wanted to do.


>From the FERC commissioner standpoint, the gold star went to Massey.  After hearing over and over again about how the commisioners didn't feel that they had been included and that FERC had not consulted them enough, he stated that he was going to express his frustration right back, saying the "there has been 7 years of process, and he wants a process that comes to an end....you've been talking for 7 years and never could agree..."


Call me if I can provide any further insights into the individual comments or the tenor of the meeting.  Sue.  #612-339-4599

U.S. Power Firms Plunge Into Europe's Trading Market; =20
U.K.'s NETA Rules May Set Continental Standard =20
By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis=20

[IMAGE]
[News item from Reuters] U.S.-owned Entergy-Koch Trading (NYSE: EKT) is boo=
sting its European electricity and weather trading business with expansion =
in Germany and the Netherlands. "After a successful start, we plan to subst=
antially increase our volume of European power, power options and weather t=
rading next year," said Uday Narang, managing director of European trading.=
 EKT also completed the paperwork needed to start trading electricity in Fr=
ance and Austria, although its immediate focus would be Germany and the Net=
herlands.=20
Analysis: The announcement from Entergy-Koch Trading that it will significa=
ntly increase its European power trading business is by no means unique. In=
 fact, a recent scan of announcements from U.S. power firms tells a similar=
 story. Dynegy announced last week that it is seeking acquisitions to stren=
gthen its European operations, in an effort to "replicate its strong U.S. e=
nergy trading platform in Europe." TXU said that it expects "sharply higher=
 profits this year" from European energy trading as its electricity trading=
 volumes have soared across the Continent. For the first nine months of 200=
1, TXU reportedly traded 211 terawatt hours of wholesale electricity in con=
tinental Europe, mostly in Germany, which compared to 97 terawatt hours in =
all of 2000. Further still, UtiliCorp just announced that it and an unnamed=
 financial partner will be purchasing Midlands Electricity, the fourth-larg=
est regional electric utility in the United Kingdom, which in addition to 3=
8,000 miles of electric distribution lines owns a 1,875-MW power plant. The=
 unrelated announcements have a common denominator: U.S. power firms are pl=
unging into the European energy trading market in droves, despite some inhe=
rent governmental challenges and resistance toward embracing electric compe=
tition among some European countries. A new model in the United Kingdom, kn=
own as the new energy trading agreement (NETA) rules, appear to be facilita=
ting more efficient trade in that country and could become the standard acr=
oss the Continent. =20
The appeal of Europe's power market for U.S. energy companies is perhaps ob=
vious. According to a Financial Times Energy report from late last year, de=
mand growth for electricity in European countries over the next five years =
may prompt the need for an additional 69,000 MW of generating capacity to b=
e built (an amount roughly equivalent to the generating capacity of ERCOT i=
n Texas). In addition, like other developed areas of the world, Europe's en=
ergy consumption has grown over the last two years. U.S. power firms, who p=
erhaps see their competitive opportunities as being rather limited in this =
country, have expanded operations in Europe, where electric privatization i=
s occurring on a country-by-country basis. Consequently, the companies ment=
ioned above join Williams, Enron, Duke, AEP, and Mirant (to name a few), wh=
ich have established London trading offices. =20
Moreover, many of the U.S. power firms that expand into Europe start by acc=
umulating generation assets in the United Kingdom, as represented by the Ut=
iliCorp and Dynegy announcements. Much of this has to do with the fact that=
 the United Kingdom began privatizing its electric market in the early 1990=
s and completed the process in May 1999 (after Norway, but well ahead of ot=
her European countries). However, there is a more important reason why U.S.=
 energy firms may be drawn to U.K. power trading, and that is related to th=
e area's unique rules for energy transactions, which were outlined in NETA =
and took effect in March of this year. =20
To appreciate the significance of the new NETA rules, it is important to fi=
rst understand the context of the European market as a whole and the tradin=
g system that had been in place in the United Kingdom until earlier this ye=
ar. The European Union has directed countries across the Continent to open =
their electric markets to competition. Toward this end, the commencement of=
 competition in various European countries has included the following three=
 approaches: 1) allowing end-users the right to select an alternative provi=
der; 2) giving generation companies the right to use an incumbent power sup=
plier's transmission and distribution network, otherwise known as third-par=
ty access; and 3) the introduction of energy trading, which has allowed an =
incumbent supplier to buy power on the wholesale market. This last point is=
 significant, because some of the European countries have dismantled previo=
usly integrated, state-owned utilities and mandated the divestiture of gene=
ration assets. =20
At the end of 2000, approximately 68.4 percent of the European Union (EU) e=
lectricity market was open to competition. Privatization has theoretically =
enabled European power companies to expand beyond their traditional service=
 territories and business lines into other countries (at least those that a=
re open). That is the good news. However, the basic problem with this appro=
ach is that the European Union did not put standardized deadlines for the t=
ransition to a fully competitive marketplace, and thus various countries in=
 Europe have developed their own timetables. For instance, Germany is fully=
 privatized, while France has been notoriously hesitant to provide third-pa=
rty access to competitors. In practice, this often means that one country m=
ay have an extremely complex system for transmission tariffs while its neig=
hboring country may have not developed any standards at all. The other prob=
lem is that physical interconnections between countries are often deficient=
, which makes it difficult to transport power across borders. As a result, =
wholesale competition across the Continent is considered rather heterogeneo=
us and lacking in comprehensive trading standards. The lack of standards is=
 particularly acute as it relates to rules and tariffs for third-party acce=
ss to the national grids on the Continent. =20
While these fundamental problems on the Continent are being resolved, the U=
nited Kingdom has moved ahead with what is generally perceived as a more ef=
ficient market because it offers one grid system, one balancing and settlem=
ent code, and one contract format. However, even the power trading market i=
n the United Kingdom did not get off to an easy start. Up until March of th=
is year, the U.K. power market operated under a pool / auction system. Unde=
r that model, generation companies offered electricity for sale, which was =
then pooled into an auction system where day-ahead bids were made and power=
 was sold in half-hour increments. The model was quite significant because =
it was one of the first attempts in the world to create a competitive marke=
t for generation and it operated outside of governmental oversight. =20
However, the pool model in the United Kingdom became fraught with problems,=
 mostly because observers believed that excessive opportunity existed for m=
arket manipulation. Given the concerns with the pool format, the United Kin=
gdom began to formulate new rules for power trading in October 1998, which =
culminated in the NETA model that started this year. The key tenets that ma=
ke NETA different from the previous pool model are:=20
Forwards and futures markets, which allow participants to form power sale d=
eals using standardized contracts either on-the-day or several years in adv=
ance (as opposed to only day-ahead bids).=20
More flexibility regarding the kinds of contracts that buyers and sellers c=
an negotiate (bilateral and multilateral contracts are allowed in the Unite=
d Kingdom).=20
A new balancing mechanism covering ancillary services overseen by National =
Grid Co. (operating in a role similar to an ISO), which facilitates the var=
ious transactions to ensure reliability.=20
The administration of contracts linking wholesale supplies with demand (rep=
resented by individual meters), and the threat of strict penalties for part=
icipants whose positions do not match their metered volumes of electricity.=
=20

In a nutshell, NETA essentially sharpened the rules surrounding power tradi=
ng in the United Kingdom to allow less opportunity for gaming. The system i=
mprovements have been successful, and more international power firms appare=
ntly believe that they stand a better chance of competing in the United Kin=
gdom due to the NETA rules. Installation of the NETA system reportedly has =
caused a 315-percent increase in the number of contracts traded, a 25-perce=
nt drop in wholesale prices and a six-fold increase in the variety of produ=
cts offered. As of early summer 2001, about 150 new participants had regist=
ered to participate under the NETA system, as compared with about 12 under =
the former model. =20
As noted, many believe that the NETA model will become a standard for the C=
ontinent as other European countries proceed with opening their wholesale m=
arkets to competition. In addition to the U.K.'s model, there are several a=
ctive trading exchanges in Europe presently, although more are expected to =
emerge as the market becomes more competitive. The Nord Pool, with about 60=
 members, organizes trade in standardized physical and financial contracts,=
 and provides current prices on electricity in both spot and futures market=
s. The Dutch Amsterdam Power Exchange has about 25 members and operates a s=
pot market for electrical power. Smaller European exchanges, offering both =
spot and futures contracts, include the Switzerland Exchange and Germany's =
Leipzig Power Exchange in Frankfurt. In the meantime, I think we will conti=
nue to see additional U.S. power firms expanding into the European trading =
market, and using the United Kingdom as their launch pad.=20

  RTO Week
Day 2 -- October 16, 2001
Transmission Planning & Expansion
The afternoon panel discussed transmission planning and expansion. The pane=
lists were: Jose Degado--CEO American Transmission Company, Michael Dworkin=
--Chair Vermont PSC, Mark Maher--VP Transmission Business Line, Bonneville =
Power Administration, Lara Manz--PSE&G, Masheed Rosenqvist--National Grid, =
Steve Walton--Enron.
General Observations
The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from t=
ime to time.  Commissioner's Breathitt and Massey were the most active in q=
uestioning.  The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initi=
al presentations, moving along the discussion by asking questions.  There w=
as some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management, howev=
er, there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmiss=
ion rights.  There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the R=
TO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market (wh=
ere are problems, how might they be solved, etc.) and that the where possib=
le that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit.  Ther=
e was a good deal of discussion of "least cost planning" and the identifica=
tion of options which are not transmission related.  All agreed there had t=
o be backstop authority to build transmission, however then the challenge i=
s who pays for it, which raises the need for dispute resolution. =20
Opening Statements
Jose Delgado: ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system op=
erator.  They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met.  They =
were formed by divestiture by IOUS, coops and munis and with a $500 million=
 asset base initially. Their current ten year plan will add $1billion of in=
vestment.   Their top priorities are connecting generation and load. =20
Michael Dworkin: Because transmission is a common good, construction affect=
s all parties not just one party.  The environmental and permitting of line=
s requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view.  The ide=
a of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multi-state project=
s, although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been us=
ed by FCC.  State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which=
 must be considered.
Mark Maher: FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when =
considering congestion management.  LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems =
with their multiple use obligations.  RTO West is developing a planning pro=
cess which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in =
the future.  The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process.
Laura Manz: The various aspects of planning are connected.  Pricing (LMP) i=
s the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and re=
sources.   No competitor should have an advantage over another.  The RTO ne=
eds a central planning process but it shouldn't push solutions.  The market=
 should decide on solutions. =20
Masheed Rosenqvist: The morning discussion of congestion management talked =
about hedging against risk.  The planning discussion is not about what we h=
ave now, but about how to avoid future congestion.  The Commission has take=
n conflicting positions in different cases.  The issues that need to be ans=
wered are:  How can merchant transmission be compensated?  Should transmiss=
ion projects be open to RFPs?  Is FERC open to market based pricing for exp=
ansions? =20
Steve Walton:  The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to =
settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that h=
as frozen transmission investment.  The RTO debate has been going on for 5 =
years or more and needs to be settled.  For expansion to go forward, there =
needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party.  Y=
ou are always going to have muddy issues in planning.  For instance if a 13=
8 kV line is all that is needed to day, but future considerations of scare =
right-of-way say a 345 kV line should be built, who pays for the extra cost=
.  In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dis=
pute resolution process, appeal able to FERC, to decide such matters.
Discussion
Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current cong=
estion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose.=
  Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built=
 with the beneficiaries funding.  Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about =
use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say=
 this is the best solution, i.e. least cost planning.  This lead to discuss=
ion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so=
 they can make intelligent decisions. =20
Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was (a) under built and =
needed lots of expansion so don't worry about overbuilding or (b) transmiss=
ion planning should consider all options before construction of new facilit=
ies.  The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the =
process.  Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions.  L=
aura Manz felt that the term "under built" is a secondary effect of not hav=
ing proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties.
Dick O'Neil asked if LMP will work in the West.  Mark Maher said it wouldn'=
t.  Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics, they manage h=
ydro facilities in PJM.  Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure=
 of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought n=
ot to be rejected just intelligently designed.  BPA is looking pricing mode=
l but LMP won't work.  Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch,=
 but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some "twea=
ks" like bilaterals and allow operator self-schedule output levels to permi=
t  river coordination.  Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to max=
imize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis.  PJM has hydro, =
but not 70% as in the Northwest.  Implementation will be different because =
such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro a=
nd base load coal.
In the summation at the end of the panel, four principles were listed:  (1)=
 RTO must provide information, (2) RTO should identify solutions, (3) RTO s=
hould be unbiased and (4) the RTO should be accountable.  The disagreement =
was over the last two points, Michael Dworkin felt that #3 (unbiased) was c=
ritical and that #4 (accountability) was accomplished by having regulators =
involved in governance.  Jose Delgado said and Transco can't be unbiased si=
nce it provides services, although the ISO above it can be, but accountabil=
ity is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake.  This last =
point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the =
tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues.

we just held an all employee meeting over at the hyatt. After ken lay spoke they held a question and answer session. the moderator read the first written question from the crowd.    " are you on crack ?".   the place went nut's.....lay didn't look to happy and deferred that question till the end.   I swear this happened.

Hello everyone:  

Would you please forward this announcement to your groups?  I really appreciate your help!

Thanks!

*************************************************************************************************************************************************

You are invited to attend the following presentation: 

PSIM: A Power Simulation Tool

PSIM is a proprietary model developed by Enron Research Group.

?	It takes Power, Gas, Weather and demand information into consideration and 
	uses Monte-Carlo simulation to assess the expected deal value and risk distribution. 
?	It evaluates complex electricity related contracts such
as Full Requirement  and load following contract. 
?	It also provides a valuation tool for power assets and asset management deals.

Enron and they are just dogging Mr. Kenneth Lay,,,,

first, and foremost, "we" ....especially me, are not scared of anybody.
second, the real answer is that any trade beyond cal 03 needs credit
approval on a deal by deal basis.

  come on, take up the wide market issue with gautam. he's easy to "spin"
up.

    going over to the parties today?   3-6 at george brown.....5-7 at the
grasshopper........7-10 back at the george brown.....    last night there
