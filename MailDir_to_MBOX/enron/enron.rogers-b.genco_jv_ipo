Subject: Re: Lincoln - EIS issue REVISED ANSWER  

4.  Are the facilities FERC jurisdictional for environmental impact statement 
purposes pursuant to 18 C.F.R. Part 380?
  Assuming the "facilities" are the lateral and interconnect, the answer is 
no.

We noticed that the only facility with information about this issue was the 
pipeline at Lincoln, although the information seemed to suggest that only the 
pipeline was subject to the EIS process.  See 2.02.12.G.  Was the rest of the 
Lincoln facility subject to the EIS process?

 Fred - someone other than me will have to answer this question as I assume 
the "Lincoln facility" refers to the plant.
 I also need to see document 2.02.12G in order to see why they believe the 
pipeline was subject to the EIS process.

 I am not aware of an EIS being prepared for the Lincoln Energy Center 
project.  I talked with Dave Kellermeyer and he was not aware of an EIS 
being   prepared for Lincoln.  I have sent an email to Dave Lazzaro at 
Peoples Energy to determine if an EIS was completed for the pipeline.  I will 
forward you his  response.

 What was the outcome of the EIS process for the pipeline?

 The interconnect facilities upstream of the intersection of the lateral and 
N. Border's Manhattan Station are subject to FERC jurisdiction.  N. Border 
completed the hot tap and interconnect facilities ( the permanent will be 
finished by December 1) under its blanket authorization and in compliance 
with any notice and/or permitting requirements.  As for the lateral, this was 
handled by Peoples.  Fred or Dave may be in a better position to ascertain 
any EIS process completed by Peoples. 

 My request to Peoples is in progress (see comment above).

Answers to your Questions:

Both Plants

1.  What are the short term NOx and CO emissions during startups, and are
there limitations during start-ups.

See answers provided by Mitch and Pat. In addition, I offer the following:

Caledonia - There is no specific exemption in the permit for startup and 
shutdown. We tried to request one when we modified the permit for peak firing 
in May. The state told us however, that there is no need to provide a 
specific exemption in the permit and that we can rely on the exemption 
provided in the general rules under (APC-S-1, Section 10.2)

Brownsville - Again, there is no specific exemption for startup and shutdown. 
We are relying on the exemption provided in the general rules under 
regulation 1200-3-20-0.02 which calls for implementation of good management 
practice to minimize emissions during startup and shutdown.

2.  Are industrial stormwater permits required at either site?

No. There is no wastewater discharge at either site

Caledonia

3.  In Caledonia, what is the custom fuel sampling schedule?

We are implementing the recommended EPA protocol for natural gas sampling 
which calls for twice per month the first six months, then once per quarter 
the first six quarters, then semi-annually thereafter. However, since we are 
also required under Part 75 to analyze for the natural gas heat content on a 
monthly basis, I have asked the plant managers to analyze for the sulfur 
content monthly. 

Brownsville

4.  What is the agency's response to the Enron letter regarding the 2nd
stormwater NOV?

We have not received any written correspondence from the agency following the 
second NOV. However, the site was inspected after completion of the 
corrective measures (around June 15) and the state inspector was satisfied 
with the progress made to bring the site into compliance with the stormwater 
construction permit.

5.  Has there been any further action by the agency since the 1st stormwater
NOV was never responded to?

I am not aware of any action

6.  One memo stated that the stormwater is channeled to a wetland.  Was that
during construction only or is it ongoing?

I am not aware of anything existing. I believe that this is during 
construction.
Mitchell -- any thoughts on that?

7.  Were there any further problems with the B T Readymix concrete dumping
issue?

Mitchell - Please respond to this question

Ben:  

Here are my answers to the Allegheny Questions below.  Please confirm the 
details with Dave Kellermeyer where necessary.

Question 1:   Does the Lincoln facility have an air operating permit from the 
Illinois Environmental Protection Agency?  If so, please provide a copy. If 
not,    please explain status.

Answer:  I believe that the application for the Title V Operating Permit for 
the Lincoln Energy Center was submitted to the IEPA in the Spring of 2000.  
Dave   Kellermeyer can definitively answer whether this Operating Permit has 
been issued/received from the IEPA.

Question 2: Were any wetlands impacted by the construction of the facility 
and, if so, what permits were obtained?  Will any wetlands be impacted by 
future   expansion plans?  ENSR's conclusion on this issue seemed unclear, 
particularly with respect to the 30 acre parcel.  See 02.03.09C.

Answer:  The ENSR Wetlands Delineation activities conducted during the period 
of December 1998 through February 1999 determined the following:
   1.  No wetlands existed on the 50 acre parcel upon which the Lincoln 
Energy Center was ultimately constructed.
   2.  An agricultural wetland area existed within the parcel of land 
adjacent to the western boundary of the Lincoln Energy Center 50 acre    
parcel.
   3.  After reviewing the ENSR wetland delineation information, the Will 
County NRCS confirmed the existence and boundary location of the    
agricultural wetland and  concurred with the ENSR conclusion that the 
agricultural wetland boundary was completely contained within the    parcel 
of land adjacent to the western boundary of the Lincoln Energy Center 50 acre 
parcel.

With regard to wetlands impacted during construction of the Facility, the 
construction of the Facility's natural gas pipeline lateral was routed 
through several existing wetland areas.  The potential impact of this 
lateral's construction on existing wetlands was mitigated through a 
directional drilling program implemented during the pipeline construction 
activity.  The Site Development permits required for this pipeline 
construction activity were obtained from the Will County Land Use 
Department.  

With regard to future Facility expansion plans, no impact to wetlands is 
expected provided that such expansion occurs within the existing boundaries 
of the 50 acre Facility parcel.

As a note to Question 2 above, I could not locate a reference to a 30 acre 
parcel within the ENSR Wetland Investigation Report described as 02.03.09C.  
Perhaps this is a typo and should be 50 acres.

Call/see me to discuss this information.  I will be in the office tomorrow 
(10/24) until 2 pm and then in Chicago on Wed-Thursday.  I will access my 
email via laptop while I am out of the office.

Fred

Gents,

I made the following changes to this model:
I adjusted all the NPV functions to be as of 12/31/2000.
I incorporated the seasonal availabilities and capacities into revenue 
calculations.  Previous to this revision, all monthly merchant revenue was 
calculated using the Winter availability and Summer capacity.  All monthly 
PPA revenues were calculated using annual average availability and Summer 
capacity.
I cleaned up the update macro and added a nifty status bar progress indicator 
while the thing's running.

Let me know if you have any other revisions or corrections.

Jon

Responses to Cinergy's Gas Transport Questions

Brownsville
1)  Verify Type of Transportation Service and Identify location of 2 hour 
notice.
Transportation is provided  under  ITS Service Agreement Contract No. 10290 
.  This contract  is ANR's  pro forma ITS Agreement from its FERC Gas 
Tariff.  Changes to the pro forma  are included in the various rate letters 
(most recent dated September 20, 2000), the Operating Agreement (dated March 
31, 1999) and the Additional ANR Transportation Service letter (dated March 
30, 1999).  These three agreements were assigned to Brownsville Power I, LLC 
per the Assignment Agreement dated December 1, 1999.  

Specific to the question of the two hour notice, Brownsville's rights are 
identified in the Operating Agreement under Article 1 on page 2 of the 
agreement (See Articles 1.01, 1.02 and 1.03).  ANR's two hour notice rights 
are also identified under Article 1 (See 1.05).  Please note that ANR's two 
hour notice right is subject to the plant having taken delivery of gas 
volumes per Articles 1.01, 1.02 and 1.03.

2)  On ETS Conversion right, is ETS service seasonal or annual?
The seasonality of the conversion is not addressed under the Additional 
Transportation Letter dated March 30, 1999.  ANR's FERC Gas Tariff does not 
preclude a seasonal application of the ETS service.  
3)  Provided gas volumes burned at plant.
To be provided under separate cover.

Caledonia
1) Identify location of FT-BH rights in transaction documents (FT-A Contract).
Transportation is provided  under  Gas Transportation Agreement Service 
Package No. 29230.  This contract  is TGP's  pro forma Agreement from its 
FERC Gas Tariff.  Changes to the pro forma  are included in the Firm 
Transportation Discount Letter dated April 7, 1999.  Additional 
transportation rights negotiated by Caledonia, such as FT-BH (page 4) and the 
FT-A replacement contract (page 5), are included in a letter dated March 31, 
1999 titled "Commercial agreement with:  CALEDONIA POWER I, L.L.C., Natural 
Gas Transportation". 
2) Identify location of 4.5 Bcf/yr obligation in transaction documents (FT-A 
Contract).
This provision is included in the  Firm Transportation Discount Letter dated 
April 7, 1999 (See page 2 and 3, Article 3).
3) Provide gas volumes burned at the plant.
To be provided under separate cover.

I am in the process of firing the off the first shot to Cinergy for a 5 or 10 
year toll starting 1/1/03.  Please provide any comments with regard to 
pricing, etc.  I just pulled the Capacity charge out of the air.  I made the 
10 year a little lower in hopes of making it more attractive.  I think a 10 
year toll attached to the asset will make it more attractive to the tolling 
providers of the world (AES, Calpine, Tenaska,etc.).  Let me know your 
thoughts and concerns before I send this off to Cinergy.

Subject: Re: Lincoln - EIS issue REVISED ANSWER  

4.  Are the facilities FERC jurisdictional for environmental impact statement 
purposes pursuant to 18 C.F.R. Part 380?
  Assuming the "facilities" are the lateral and interconnect, the answer is 
no.

We noticed that the only facility with information about this issue was the 
pipeline at Lincoln, although the information seemed to suggest that only the 
pipeline was subject to the EIS process.  See 2.02.12.G.  Was the rest of the 
Lincoln facility subject to the EIS process?

 Fred - someone other than me will have to answer this question as I assume 
the "Lincoln facility" refers to the plant.
 I also need to see document 2.02.12G in order to see why they believe the 
pipeline was subject to the EIS process.

 What was the outcome of the EIS process for the pipeline?

 The interconnect facilities upstream of the intersection of the lateral and 
N. Border's Manhattan Station are subject to FERC jurisdiction.  N. Border 
completed the hot tap and interconnect facilities ( the permanent will be 
finished by December 1) under its blanket authorization and in compliance 
with any notice and/or permitting requirements.  As for the lateral, this was 
handled by Peoples.  Fred or Dave may be in a better position to ascertain 
any EIS process completed by Peoples.

As all of you know, we will begin the plant tours on Thursday, Oct. 12., and 
they will last through Friday, the 27th.  Mike, Mitch and I have met with 
everyone except Dave and Chris about the tour and sales process.  At that 
meeting, the following scheduling conflicts were identified.

Mike Miller - 12,13,14
Jeff Keenan - 16,17,18
Mitro- 12,13, 16

We will begin scheduling today.  If anyone has any other conflicts, please 
let me know ASAP.

Thanks for your help with this process.

Gents,

I have created and populated the due diligence folders in Livelink for the 
1999 Peakers.  Attached are the slimmed-down indexes of the documents that 
were moved.  We'll need to go through these documents to find the redactions.

Subject: Revised JV Term Sheet for E2


Attached is the JV Term Sheet that was originally drafted by Lance which I 
have revised in the following ways:

1)  The concept of having 25% of the aggregate consideration supported by a 
letter of credit or otherwise payable in cash has been added.
2)  The bracketed questions/comments relating to (1) Purchaser's potential 
ability to effect a tax free contribution without requiring the establishment 
by the issuer of a holding company and (2) the request for confirmation about 
non-compete arrangements and development opportunities, have been deleted 
[JORDAN - PLEASE ADVISE IF THIS IS PROBLEMATIC]
3)  The Doyle and Calumet facilities have been removed from Annex A
4)  The entity names for the Wheatland and Lincoln Sites have been inserted.

Please call asap with any questions or comments

Stuart

Jinsung and Don,

We are continuing to have difficulties accessing data from DealBench.  The
response times from PECO, PricewaterhouseCoopers and other high speed
internet connections have been very slow (sometimes 5 minutes or more to
retrieve a single 10-15 page text document).  It would help us greatly in
our due diligence efforts if this material could be made available on CD
ROM as has often been done with other deals we have been involved with.
Please advise if this is possible and if so, when the CD's would be
available.

The following is an update on Enron's sales process, including several
additions to DealBench.

1.  The Purchase and Sale Agreement ("PSA") for each asset has now been
posted to DealBench under the New Document section.  Please review the
instructions attached to each PSA.

2. The Management Presentations (with audio) have now been posted to
DealBench under the Management Presentation(strikethrough: s) section.
When attempting to view the presentation, please log onto DealBench using
Microsoft Internet Explorer. Once in DealBench, you will most likely need
to download "Flash Player" (free download).  You can do this by clicking
"Macromedia Flash Player download center" in the Linked Documents section
of DealBench.  The download usually takes less than 30 seconds.  After the
download, return to the Management Presentation section of DealBench and
click on the Management Presentation (with audio).   A power point
presentation has also been included in the Management Presentation section
of DealBench.   A detailed instruction guide "Instruction for Viewing
Management Presentation" has been posted in New Document section of
DealBench.

3.  Please be sure to consistently review the New Documents section on
DealBench for any new documents that have been added to DealBench.  Also, a
running black line Due Diligence Index is posted in the Due Diligence Index
/ Plant Pictures section of DealBench.

4. Any drawings or CDs that you need from the Due Diligence Indices may be
requested by sending an email to don.miller@enron.com or jhoff2@enron.com.

5.  Any problems or issues that you may be encountering need to  be
directed to Jinsung Myung at 713-853-7330.

6.  We are prepared to schedule Q&A sessions.  Please contact Don Miller at
713-853-0492.

Regards,

Don Miller

I have a meeting with Dave on Monday at 8:30am. We will be bringing the deal
guys (Bill Grealis, Chuck Winger, Art Vivar, myself and possibly one other)
so we're ready to listen and make something shake loose. I am also going to
contact Rich Kinder this week to talk about the possibilities.

I very much appreciate your input and your insight and would welcome your
help when the time is right. As a side note you may have heard that
Madeleine Ludlow has left to pursue other business interests and we are in
the hunt for a corporate CFO and talent as I mentioned is my number one
priority. As to your inclusion in this meeting I will inquire with Dave as
to the attendees and mention your name as a good participant. (Dave's call
obviously). Thanks again....

Mike:

Thanks again for taking the time to meet with me last week.  I left you Rich
Kinder's number on Thursday with your assistant, Sheilla - hope you got it.
Again, I think a deal between or three companies is something to really look
at.
I think it creates a great story to the street.  Kinder/Morgan brings the
growth
story, the gas pipelines for the convergence play and the development team,
Enron brings the MW's and trading and Cinergy brings MW's, trading and
operating
expertise.  I feel that Enron and Cinergy can work togther with regards to
the
trading.  I am sending you an anayst report I just finish reading regarding
generation spinoffs - I think it will be helpful.   Also, Kay Chapman,
Dave's
assistant informed me that you were coming up next week, and I wanted to
know if
you wanted me to be there or not or if you wanted me to prepare anything for
you
for the meeting.

Hope you had a good weekend and I look forward to talking to you soon.
Regards,
Ben

Ben,
Here's the information on the ABB GT11N turbines.  They are available for 
immediate delivery (once removed from New Brunswick).

If the party has questions please have them give me a call.  If they need 
more detailed information on the units we can put a CA in place.

Gents - 

Here is your spreadsheet. There are comments at the bottom each sheet. Many 
of them bring up the same points and I stopped making specific comments at 
the older projects. Sky River and VG comments are more detailed because we 
are the project partner again as of last week (these were divested for QF 
reasons in 1997).On the EnronSumm sheet added are some recommended further 
info to request and a summary of the main points in the comments. On the 
EnronVal sheet I suggest an alternative valuation for your consideration 
although issues on which I've made comments will still need resolution. Let 
me know what I can do for you further and when/if you'd like to go over this.

Cheers - Eddie

Subject: Re: FW: Questions/Wheatland  

Mitch - Whether or not we qualify to even apply for an NPDES permit is 
contingent upon the results of the mercury sampling. If the Mercury 
concentration is greater than 12 ppt, we can not apply for a permit. This is 
a very low threshold and it is likely that we are not going to meet it. The 
sampling was done last week, but the results are not out yet. If the results 
show that we can meet the mercury limit, we still need to assess the cost of 
building a 3-mile pipeline to the white river. We have not yet given 
authorization to do this study. Ross Newlin is taking the lead on this.

If everything goes well, we may be able to submit an application by middle of 
December at the earliest.

Protocol for CEMS approval - CEMS must be installed, certified, and quality 
assured as per the acid rain requirements contained in the Code of Federal 
Regulations (CFR) Part 75. The process involves performing a series of 
initial tests, including Relative accuracy test audits (RATAs), linearity 
checks, cycle/response time checks, and calibration drifts.  It also involves 
significant recordkeeping and reporting requirements.

Rick, have we been able to come up with a summary sheet on the performance 
tests?

>  b.  Confirm that all warranties are in name of LLC or transferable
> to LLC.
Stuart, this one is probably more in your bag. I would suggest that we state, 
all bidders should assume that warranties will be placed in the LLC's name 
prior to closing and that all warranties are fully transferable.  (Note that 
currently, the warranties are not in the LLC's name, but are in ENA's name).

>  c.  What is the protocol for CEMS approval.
Gus, can you take a stab at this one?

>  d.  Provide water quality test results.
Don, this should now be in the DD room.

>  e.  Provide all outage reports.
Rick/Brent, do we have all of these?  Any problem with providing them?

>  f.   Provide overhaul budgeting.
Don, not yet developed.  Overhaul budgeting will be completed as any 
scheduled overhaul reaches the near-term horizon.  Our method of budgeting 
for overhauls is to accrue maintenance dollars for every start (approx $1500 
per start).  We continually re-evaluate whether we are starts based or hours 
based.  Currently, we remain starts based maintenance.

>  g.  Provide copy of application for discharge permit.
Application has not yet been submitted.  We have only entered initial 
discussions with the state.  We will submit the application once developed - 
- currently expected by xxxxx date (Gus, please verify this is true).

Brownsville SPCC plan - The plan is currently in draft form. It will be 
finalized and signed by the end of the week.
Emergency Response Plan - We are not required to have one by law. However, I 
believe we do have one for the site. Mitchell- - please have your assistant 
make a copy and send it to Ben.
CEMS QA/QC - Available at the plant, Mitchell will provide a copy
CEMS certification report - Should already be on DealBench
Monthly log of emissions as required by condition #4 of the permit, Available 
at the plant, Mitchell has already given Duke a copy for the month of October 
when they were on-site yesterday.
Annual Emissions Report (condition #11)  - We submitted two semi-annual 
reports for the site so far, one on January 31, 2000 and another on July 31, 
2000. Mitchell will provide copy of the July report and the January report if 
available. The January report covers emissions for the third and fourth 
quarters of 1999.  This is really the annual report for 1999 because we did 
not operate in the first and second quarters of 1999. Duke already saw the 
July report covering January through June 2000.

I've review all three.  We have definite problems with WIlton.  The other two 
are correctable without Mike's assistance.  My comments are below:

Wilton:
- The OBA is a ten year agreement ending March 31, 2010 (not a two year 
term).  You can probably delete 
 the sentence where he addresses term.
- The transport rate on Northern Border is approximately 4 cents per 100 
dekatherm mile (not 4 cents)
- The ANR IPLS Agreement expires in April of 2001 and then rolls month to 
month thereafter.
 The discounted rate of 3 cents is only good through October of 2000, then 
the rate reverts to
 maximum tariff rate (unless negotiated otherwise).

Wheatland
- Delete Mike's sentence where he talks about term. 

Gleason
- The info I heard was fine; however, the beginning of his narrative is cut 
off.

I'll be at the doctors office from 7:00 a.m. till about 10:00 a.m then in a 
meeting from 10:00 to 11:00.  I'll try to catch you guys in between.  
Otherwise try me on my cell 713-408-6240.

Ben, 
Attached is the latest draft of the Beck report. I'm attaching a list that I 
prepared that generally has the items that are outstanding; however, the 
priority items are the back up information on performance testing (& curves) 
of the inlet fogging system and the peaking testing (output) of the three 
units and the confirmation of the data in table 5 (long term performance of 
the projects).
I have the O&M contracts, the monthly reports, and the contracts between OEC 
and Caldwell for the inlet fogging system, but these do not contain what 
Conrad (RW Beck) is looking for. My understanding from the operations guys is 
that there is data for the above items.
As discussed, Conrad will be here Monday morning, so if we could have the 
back up information for these items by then, it would expedite the process 
tremendously.
You can reach me at 54426 if you have any questions.
Thanks for your help.
Joana

resulted in soil or groundwater contamination?  Please provide details of
any incidents. Have there been any incidents since the plant achieved
commercial operation?  Please provide details.

3.   [Wheatland] It is our understanding that the switchyard will be owned
by the project and maintained by Cinergy.  Please provide a copy of the
proposed contract with Cinergy.  What indemnification will Cinergy provide
the project related to environmental incidents in the switchyard?

4.   [Wheatland] It is our understanding that the quality of the plant's

to have this informaiton for Lincoln and Gleason as well.]

6.   [Wheatland] Please provide a listing of all non-Enron organizations
involved in the development, design, and construction of the facility who
may have a continuing relationship with the project, including outstanding

7.   [Wheatland] Are there any formal contracts between West Fork Land
Development Company and Lake Acquisition Company? Please provide.

8.   [Wheatland] Are there any currently enforceable warranties running
from the project to the EPC contractor (We understand it to be Enron

structural stability or integrity of the shoreline of the "Lake".  During
the site visit it was observed that one shoreline on one side of the Lake
had been reinforced.

10.  [Wheatland] Provide any studies discussing the seismic activity in the
vicinity of the Wheatland facility.

11.   [Wheatland] Were transmission upgrades required of Wheatland by
either Cinergy or IPL? Were transmission service credits credited to

All,

This morning I provided the following info and documents.  I will correspond 
with all of you but am sending the documents to Mitch Robinson's fax machine 
unless requested to do otherwise by Mitch.

1.  I fax'd to Mitch and Stuart Zisman the results of the "Personal Property" 
inventory.
2.  I fax'd Mitch the most recent water bill.  To the best of my knowledge 
there is no contract with the Town of Caledonia for water.  We utilize an 
industrial user account.  The account number (14670) is on the bill. 
3.  I fax'd Mitch the Emergency Action Plan.  This plan is under revision.  I 
sent the existing plan as well as the portion of the plan where revisions are 
complete.
4.  I also sent the Semi-Annual Excess Emissions Report.

After lunch I will send the CEMs QA/QC documents and CEMs data which has been 
requested.

Site personnel, under my direction conducted a spot check of spare parts 
utilizing the most recent inventory list provided by Jim Meyer.  I certify 
that the spare parts inventory, based upon this spot check, is substantially 
complete including the high-dollar components.

Regards,
Pat Cathers

DealBench

Enron Net Works' newest initiative is now online!  

The Product
DealBenchTM is an online platform that enables licensing companies to arrange 
and execute transactions  efficiently and effectively.  Companies that 
license DealBenchTM are able to organize their transaction materials, upload 
documents and other materials to a secure website, invite deal participants 
to view deal materials, host various types of online auctions and manage, 
track and close a transaction online.  
DealBenchTM incorporates five specific business tools that streamline the 
transaction process for licensees:
Document Sharing:   deal-related materials in various formats (Word, 
Powerpoint, Excel, CAD drawings, digital pictures,      etc.) can be uploaded 
for deal participants to view and/or edit.

Auctioning/Bidding:   licensees can design and monitor (in real-time) forward 
or reverse auctions and collect sealed tender      bids.

Multi-media:    customers can present high quality virtual road shows and 
asset descriptions using streaming video.

Secure Communication:  DealLineTM messaging system facilitates one-to-one, 
one-to-many, and many-to-many        communication.

Deal Management:   DealNotesTM  enables customers to monitor the progress of 
their deals using statistics on user      downloads, bidding/auction results 
and user page views.


Applications
DealBenchTM has been used by Enron during bank product syndications, the sale 
of a large portfolio of leases, and the procurement of certain materials for 
the new headquarters building.   Soon, DealBenchTM will also meet the 
collaboration needs of Enron attorneys, facilitate online RFQs and provide 
for the hosting of online datarooms.  

To learn more about DealBenchTM, please join eSpeak on Wednesday October 4th 
when Harry Arora (Vice-President, eCommerce) will answer questions regarding 
this Enron Net Works initiative.  For additional information, please visit 
https://www.DealBench.com (username= guest, password= dealbench) or email 
webmaster@DealBench.com.
NOTE:  If you are unable to execute the above link, please copy the link into 
the address line of your installed browser.

We welcome all thoughts and ideas on how the DealBench platform can be 
utilized to address the needs of Enron's business units.  Further, as the 
platform is available to be licensed externally, please forward new business 
development leads to members of the    DealBenchTM team.

Here are the contents of the damaged floppy disk.  It
looks like there are multiple indices for some of the
projects.  I have included all the files, so we can sort
through to see which are the correct ones to use.  I'm
assuming that these files are not corrupted.  My machine
is too old to be able to open them.  And yet it was
sophisticated enough to recover the files.

I can only attach 5 files to an e-mail, so I'll have to
send them in multiple batches.

I think I have cleaned this one up.  I removed the PPA portion (2001-2003).  
I haven't played with the debt too much; I just reduced it to give us roughly 
the same coverages as we had in the previous model.  Please review and let me 
know what I missed -- I'm sure there are a lot of things.  I have to take off 
around 3:00 this afternoon to turn in the keys from my old apartment, so 
e-mail your changes, and I'll get on it first thing tomorrow morning.

Clement:  We have an add'l issue on the LM  6000's and that is on IDC.  My 
understanding is when we originally structured the sharing of the West LB 
interim interest, we were assuming the turbines would move out of the 
facility to Project Facilities.  Since we have turbines that do not have 
homes, but will continue to incur add'l IDC, we would like to agree on a new 
methodology for accruing IDC per turbine.  We look forward to meeting with 
you soon to discuss this.  Let me know when you are available.  

Thanks, Thomas.

Matt:  thanks for the memo.  
As per my discussions with Billy, there is no problem with Austin being on 
balance sheet because we are accounting for our interest as a % of the J.V.  
and will accrue income, not Fair Value it.  
As to the turbine/West L.B. structure moving forward, I have left a message 
with Bruce Golden recommending in our next meeting we include the 
Procurement/Purchasing agent from NEPCO who would be involved in any 
ancillary purchases.  Additionally, accounting should be represented.  

Let us know when next week will work for you.  Thanks, Thomas.

budget meeting. When structuring the Acquisition and Development Agreement 
(ADA) for the LM6000s with West LB, a spending budget for major equipment 
purchases was put together and signed off by Mike Miller and Chris Booth 
which included ancillary equipment items, such as transformers but also 
chillers, stacks and compressors, etc, through November 12, 2000. What I 
heard in yesterday's meeting is that related to the LM6000's, NEPCO plans to 
order not just major equipment but smaller items too.   We need to ensure 
that  (1) the ADA as currently drafted allows for non-major items and (2) 
those items have been budgeted. We will get back to you related to (1).   

More generally, accounting has told us that NEPCO cannot pay directly for ANY 
(big or small) hard costs for which it is not reimbursed (this includes items 
for City of Austin until their units and associated ancillary equipment are 
removed from the West LB structure). Specifically, that means NEPCO must  (1) 
have a contract for all of the items (big or small) it plans to purchase on 
behalf of West LB as its acquisition agent (Kay please provide such language 
to Bruce Golden - he has informed me about an SCR LOI out there) and (2) have 
it in the West LB budget.  It would be helpful if CTG could coordinate with 
NEPCO so that all binding LOIs or contracts be reviewed ahead of time by 
accounting and finance to ensure off-balance sheet treatment. 

I will ask my assistant to put together another meeting to further discuss 
the purchase process and that the current West LB budget truly reflects what 
NEPCO plans to purchase on behalf of West LB.

Thanks,
Matt

If you can let me know when you have talked with Dave, that would be great.
I am trying to talk with Don Miller and wanted to make sure that you had
already talked with Dave.  Enron's PRC is going on and I am trying to get
promoted to manager and this deal should enable me to do just that.  Thanks
again for your comments to Dave.

Subject: Questions regarding PSD permit for Lincoln


Don,

As a result of our review of the information and documents on Lincoln we
are requesting additional documents which are not in the data room.

1.   Relating to the plant's PSD:

     The Mostardi & Platt emissions test protocol for the May 2000
     emissions test
      A report to Illlinois EPA containing the emission test data
     Continuous Emission Monitoring (" CEM") Data ( all data
     developed since start-up)
     Any reports to IEPA required under the permit pertaining to
     exceedances, or
     start-up, breakdown & malfunction ( we have internal memos indicating
     that there
     was a breakdown at # 7 on July 5,2000)

2. Also, we don't have any permits for wastewater discharge. We have been
told that there is no wastewater discharged except
sewage/office wastewater which is going to a septic field. But we have no
verification of this at this point.

Thank you for your attention to these items.

I am working with Don Miller and will be responsible for receiving and 
processing all due diligence requests for Pastoria.  

Below are our responses to PG&E's questions:


QUESTION:Is the major maintenance reserve estimate based on a negotiated Long 
Term Services Agreement (LTSA)?  If so, will it be in place and transfer with 
PEF?

RESPONSE:  We have not negotiated an LTSA with anyone at this time, and we do 
not expect to have one in place to transfer with PEF.  The maintenance 
reserve is our estimate based on industry data and information from GE.


QUESTION: Are spare parts for the first major overhaul included anywhere in 
the capital cost estimate or are they assumed to be purchased through the 
maintenance reserve estimate (i.e. the LTSA) charge?

RESPONSE:  The maintenance reserve is intended to include parts and labor for 
the overhaul.


QUESTION: What is Enron's intent re: continuing involvement?  PG&E is 
concerned about any potential requirements that they might be required to 
either purchase fuel from Enron or engage Enron as the power marketer.

RESPONSE: Enron is very flexible re continuing involvement:  scheduling 
coordination, fuel supply, power marketing, etc.  We are also flexible re the 
time period and the terms of the continuing involvement.  Whatever 
arrangement is developed would be mutually beneficial.


QUESTION: What is status of EPC negotiations.  Will they be required to 
engage NEPCO as the EPC contractor?  Does the EPC contractor have control 
over the turbines?

RESPONSE: o EPC negotiations are complete with NEPCO.  Contract has not been 
executed, but has been "put on the shelf" awaiting decision on successful 
bidder for the purchase of the Pastoria project from ENA.  Successful bidder 
and NEPCO will each have the option of executing the EPC agreement.

  o The successful bidder will be under no obligation to engage NEPCO.

  o Pastoria has control of the turbines.  


QUESTION: They also questioned whether there would be any "agricultural
restrictions"?

RESPONSE: The project site is presently under a Williamson Act contract to 
maintain agricultural use in exchange for lower taxes.  Last week, the Kern 
County Board of Supervisors voted to cancel the Williamson Act contract to 
allow for industrial use, which started a 180-day public comment period.  
However, the Governor has on his desk a bill for signature that would reduce 
the public comment period for the cancellation to the same time frame as the 
request for rehearing period for the CEC Final Decision.  (The Governor has 
until 9/30 sign the bill and is expected to do so because of the overwhelming 
support of the bill in the Assembly and the Senate.)  The cancellation will 
be contingent upon a successful CEC decision and a payment of a Williamson 
Act cancellation fee.


QUESTION: I received a call from Tom Favinger at PG&E today.  He would like 
to get a breakout of the $10.25 million item in the Pastoria capital budget 
labeled Pre-Commercial Operations Costs.

RESPONSE: The breakdown (in $MM) is as follows:

Project management during construction  $1.000
Start-up and acceptance    2.900
Insurance and performance bond   1.846
Owner's Engineer     1.500
County Chief Building Officer/Engineer/Consultant 3.000

TOTAL      $10.246


Should you have any questions, please call me at 713.345.8992.

Annual Emissions Report (condition #11)  - We submitted two semi-annual 
reports for the site so far, one on January 31, 2000 and another on July 31, 
2000. Mitchell will provide copy of the July report and the January report if 
available. The January report covers emissions for the third and fourth 
quarters of 1999.  This is really the annual report for 1999 because we did 
not operate in the first and second quarters of 1999. Duke already saw the 
July report covering January through June 2000.

I changed Heat rates for Caledonia and Gleason, and Start Charge for Gleason. 
Heat rates has no impact on numbers. Only increased start charge reduced IRR 
from 13.966% to 13.947% with same debt and equity scenario. I think we can 
stay with previous numbers (debt and equity) with new heat rates and start 
charge. Jin

Subject: Question 2


More Questions:

Both Plants

1.  What are the short term NOx and CO emissions during startups, and are
there limitations during start-ups.

Start-up emissions vary and can not accurately be measured due to the 
inherent delay time in the CEMS system.  Additionally, start-up emissions are 
not required to be and in fact were not measured during the stack testing.  
There are no limitations on emissions during start-up evolutions, since the 
permits at both plants allow exceptions to exceedences during start-ups and 
shutdowns.

Short term NOx emissions due to start ups are as follows:

Unit #1 = 78.95 ppmc
Unit #2 = 79.49 ppmc
Unit #3 = 87.58 ppmc
Unit #4 = 89.48 ppmc

TDEC Operating Permit #950748F special condition #5 requires that Brownsville 
Power 1 L.L.C. (BPI) operate at 0.057 #/MMBtu and 0.090 #/MMBtu for units 
#1-2 and #3-4 respectively, with a total NOx emission limit of 249 Total Tons 
per Year.  The TDEC Division of Air Pollution Control regulation chapter 
1200-3-20-.02 (1) regulates the reasonable measures required to keep emission 
to a minimum during startups, shutdowns and malfuntions.  There is no Special 
Condition outling rolling averages or compliance with a certain time limit 
for NOx emissions otherthan "Reasonable Measures Required."

2.  Are industrial stormwater permits required at either site?

Brownsville Power was issued a Tennesse Multi-Sector General Permit (TMGP) 
#TNR05XXX for Storm Water Discharges associated with Industrial Activity. Mr. 
Jacke Wade, TDEC Division of Water Pollution stated that if the NOV's were 
not satisfied after July 1, 2000 a new TDEC rule was being promulgated to 
convert the TMGP back into a Storm Water permit during construction.  I 
believe the NOV's have been satisified and can therefore request TDEC to 
terminate the TMGP.  Due to BPI's sic code of 4911, it is my understanding 
that we are not required to maintain an Industrial storm water permit or 
SPDES permit.  

Caledonia

3.  In Caledonia, what is the custom fuel sampling schedule?

The fuel monitoring schedule has been monthly from Comercial Operation 6-7-00 
through 4-00.  Then in accordance with the TDEC letter dated 9-10-99 
Brownsville Power was granted a custom fuel monitoring schedule.  The 
schedule consists of sulfur monitoring conducted twice monthly for six 
months; then sulfur monitoring conducted once per quarter for six quarters;if 
fuel analyses show little variability the samples will be conducted twice 
annually during the first and third quarters of each calendar year.

Brownsville

4.  What is the agency's response to the Enron letter regarding the 2nd
stormwater NOV?

I spoke with Mr. Jacke Wade on 6-14-00 and requested he visit the site to 
inspect the work completed.  His response was " I will inspect the facility 
as time permits and if I do not show up on your door step your o.k."  I have 
not heard from him to date.

5.  Has there been any further action by the agency since the 1st stormwater
NOV was never responded to?

Not to my knowledge other than issuance of the 2nd NOV dated 5-1-00.

6.  One memo stated that the stormwater is channeled to a wetland.  Was that
during construction only or is it ongoing?

I do not recall specifically wetland being mentioned, but the TDEC letter 
dated 2-22-99 and 5-1-00 refers to the "sediment retention basin".  In my 
internal memo to Mitch Robinson dated 9-14-00 I outlined the corrective 
measures which included the excavation of the holding pond (sediment 
retention pond) and build a spillway for sediment retention.

7.  Were there any further problems with the B T Readymix concrete dumping
issue?

I spoke to Aquila again today.  They are planning to submit bids on Friday
for Gleason, Wheatland and Pastoria.  They already have a tolling agreement
in the Lincoln area and don't want more capacity there.

Aquila's question:

They questioned the development costs for Pastoria - look very high.  I
noted that it includes the ERC's.  They would like a breakout of the
development costs


PG&E's question is below.  Are you comfortable disclosing this at this stage
or is this a phase II due diligence item?

Since we do not have to accept the NEPCO contract, can you break out the
cost and scope of equipment (Enron uses the term "power islands")?  Can we
get this information tomorrow?  Both cost and scope of this is important to
be able to assess the "EPC" price and determine bid price.

It appears that we did not cancel the second station service contract with 
Monroe County.  This second contract was for construction power supply, and 
is now used as an emergency source of power for hotel loads, etc.  Note that 
it is not sufficient to start up the plant.  We spend approximately $9,000 
per month in demand charges for this emergency hotel load capability; 
however, the contract can be canceled by Caledonia Power I, LLC with 90 days' 
prior written notice.

Bottom line:  Both contracts belong on DealBench.  Both contracts are still 
in force.  Next time we talk with the bidders, I will describe this 
capability.

Don, for labeling purposes on DealBench, the one labeled "Power Supply 
Contract" is the 480V supply and is not sufficient for starting the plant; 
the one labeled "Industrial Power Contract" is at 500kV, and is sufficient 
for starting the plant.  I would label them "480V Power Supply Contract" and 
"500kV Industrial Power Contract", respectively.

In addition, you can forward this e-mail on to potential bidders.

Mitch

ADOBE SWEET ADOBE
The publishing giant sees higher margins ahead. Solid 2001 in
store?

By Rick Aristotle Munarriz

When is less, more? For publishing software leader Adobe
(Nasdaq: ADBE) it means growing operating profits next year by
scaling back on research and development. The company announced
its guidance at yesterday's 2000 Fall Financial Analyst Meeting.

The logic may seem absurd in this era of perpetual obsolescence.
The failure to plant seeds today means less of a harvest to reap
tomorrow. But Adobe feels that it can still seize the future by
trimming research expenditures from 20% to just 19% of projected
sales.

"Our R&D investment is larger than the annual revenues of most
of our competitors, and we do think that gives us a competitive
advantage," Adobe President Bruce Chizen told Fool analyst Zeke
Ashton back in September. So even if the company does hold back
on research, it should still remain ahead of the pack.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=184234

Like hue-tinkering on Adobe Photoshop, it appears that the
prospects are brighter than the 20% growth analysts were
projecting. The company expects revenue growth of at least 25%
next year. With operating margins now set to climb from 31% to
32%, estimates are now poised to be revised about a dime above
the $2.56 consensus.

In the meeting -- which ran just over two hours long -- the
company shared its enthusiasm over its role in the new economy.
Adobe has gone from a leader in the realm of desktop publishing
for print media to serving as the software backbone for online
and network publishing. Its ePaper Solutions segment is expected
to provide a 65% growth spurt in sales next year. That's a stark
contrast to the print publishing side. There the company is
looking for just a 10% hike in revenue. Adobe has always known
how to touch up a picture, and this horizon seems to have a
crusty glow.

NEWS TO GO

It's election day. Time to voice your vote. Like, what matters
more, the top or the bottom line? VoiceStream Wireless (Nasdaq:
VSTR) reported revenue of $562.2 million, well ahead of analyst
expectations and 317% higher than last year's $134.9 million
showing. Strong subscriber growth led the way. But bloated
expenses found the company also producing a much wider loss than
was projected. The company is in the process of being acquired
by Germany's Deutsche Telekom (NYSE: DT).

Knocking chips off the global building blocks, two sources
abroad warned of lower chip prices earlier today. First it was
Douglas Lee, an executive director at Goldman Sachs in Asia,
predicting that DRAM prices will continue to fall well into next
year. Then Germany's largest semiconductor maker, Infineon
Technologies (NYSE: IFX), warned of weaker demand and
consequently lower prices in its memory business during the
current quarter. However, Infineon reported a strong close to
its fiscal year and maintains a positive outlook through the
next three years thanks to growth in other high-margin
businesses.

General Electric (NYSE: GE)? No. Not quite. But Dollar General
(NYSE: DG) and Emerson Electric (NYSE: EMR) reported earnings
this morning. Both companies held their ground with results that
were in-line with analyst expectations.

Casino gaming equipment maker International Game Technology
(NYSE: IGT) has beaten the house. The company trumped the
quarterly estimate of $0.63 a share by reporting earnings of
$0.66 before charges. The strong hand was there for the taking.
All one had to do is count cards. Two weeks ago Anchor Gaming
(Nasdaq: SLOT) also topped projections on the hot demand for its
video gaming machines themed to television shows such as
Jeopardy! and I Dream of Jeanie. Those devices are being rolled
out as a joint venture involving both companies. How popular are
IGT's slots and video-gaming machines? The company topped the
billion-dollar mark in revenue this year.

Attached is the latest weekly report.  You should notice a significant 
increase in forecast by the amount of the Acceleration for each project 
(previously shown as Unapproved trend changes, not included in forecast) 
totaling $21.5 million.   I am currently working with the developers to 
revise the forecast for the ENA expenses for such items as Spare Parts and 
Interconnect Costs.

The report does reflect Nepco payments through June with an Estimate to 
Complete.  However the report does not show actuals by budget line item for 
the NEPCO reimbursables for May (Gleason and Wheatland) or June.   Mike 
Miller and I are currently working with EECC trying to resolve three issues, 
one of which are timely accurate reports. 


Dave,

I did receive an invoice from EECC for the $9 million fee for the 2000 
projects, which I think Mike forwarded to you.  Let me know if I need to 
include the fee, previously pulled out, in the forecast.

Thanks Amy 3-7805

Enclosed is a copy of the new certificate for the Oxy ERCs.

The certificate names "Enron North American Corporation" as the holder.
Barry and Joan, can you confirm this is not a problem.  Also, could you
please review the certificate to make sure it is otherwise OK (looks that
way to me).

The agreement with Oxy contemplated a live closing where we would swap wire
confirmation info for the original certificate.  Oxy is proposing Enron pay
first and they will then FedEx the certificate when the transfers have been
"verified."  Sheila, is this OK?

The last day to pay is Monday October 9, which is Columbus day.  I have not
verified whether that is a bank holiday.  Perhaps the payment should be made
on Friday October 6 in any event.

We are waiting to get a file endorsed copy of a financing statement
termination from Chevron.  I will remind them of that.

Subject: Revised Due Diligence Indices


Stuart,

Attached are a clean and a blackline version of each of the due diligence 
indices for the six plants.  As you know, I have recently made several 
additions to each of these indices based upon my time in the data room this 
past week.  This includes recent documents for the 2000 peakers as well as 
other previously unseen documents that came from the boxes that were given to 
me by Don Miller.

I understand that Jinsung and Ben Rogers had previously given the prior 
drafts to Ben Jacoby and others to review for redacting purposes.  It will be 
necessary and useful to give these blacklines to those persons doing that 
review to note the recent additions and review these as well.

I also understand from Carolyn Gilley that she will coordinate with Lorie 
Leigh regarding the creation of the due diligence files on Live Link.  It 
seems relevant that Jinsung and Ben Rogers are also aware of how this process 
would work.

My understanding, and I will confirm that this is done, is that Carolyn's 
scanning personnel are to be scanning in the additions into Live Link today 
per my request.  There is also some filing and re-filing that will need to be 
done in the data room and I have alerted Lorie Leigh to this fact via voice 
mail on Friday.

I seem to have left Don Miller's, as well as Ben Rogers' and Jinsung's, 
e-mail addresses at my home over the weekend.  By copy of this e-mail, I am 
asking Lorie to please forward it to Don, Ben, and Jinsung.  She has 
confirmed to me via telephone that she will do so.

If you or any of the others involved in this project have any further 
question, please do not hesitate to call me.  Thank you.

Best regards,

Don:

I looked into the EPCRA reporting requirements for Sulfuric acid and lead in 
batteries. This is a one time report to the State's emergency planning 
committee, the local emergency response department, and the local fire 
department declaring the presence of sulfuric acid and lead in quantities 
greater than 500 lb and 10,000 lb, respectively.  These notifications are 
being mailed out today. I have not had a chance to do a detailed calculation 
of the amounts. I will do an analysis over the next few months to determine 
if we are required to also annually report by March 1st every year.

Dave will answer the first two issues below.

Thanks.

Gus

Don, based on our conference call last week and the fax sent to me, I am
still in need of the following:
* The air permit to construct application as submitted to IDEM and any
correspondence related to the application.  I do not need the actual permit
as issued by IDEM.
* Petition for Alternate testing.  The cover page was faxed.  Dave
Kellermeyer was to Fed Ex the remainder.  If this has been done, let me
know.  I will have to track it down.
* Determination of EPCRA reporting requirements for lead acid
batteries.

Additionally, we discussed yesterday a request for any analytical data
associated with the Lake Acquisition property, particularly sediment samples
from the lake bottom.

Thanks for your help.

Team,

As everyone knows, we will use DealBench (a secure on-line platform) as a 
virtual due diligence room and for more. We are in the process of uploading 
electronic copy of due diligence documents, plant pictures, due diligence 
list, management presentation with voices of developers and more on 
DealBench. 

Attached is the first draft of DealBench instruction I prepared. You will 
receive invitation email(s) to DealBench. Please read attached instruction 
and  log onto DealBench. Please give us any comments on using DealBench based 
on your experience. We will improve this instruction and send out to Phase II 
bidders next week. 

Regards,

Jinsung Myung

A detail concerning our visit to Gleason on Tuesday, 10/17/2000.  Due to a
different travel schedule, I will be arriving later than the bulk of the
team.  In my absence the Team contact will be Jon Pritchett from our Asset
Managment Group.  Jon's cell phone is 704-904-4163.

Any questions, please don't hesitate to call.

Don,

Attached are three docs: (1) the revised PPA term sheet which I believe has
all of the changes, (2) the General Terms and (3) a redline of the General
Terms highlighting my questions/comments.  Generally Delainey was a genius
as expected but a few things really ought to be tightened down before the
doc is sent.

I would like to schedule a conf. call on Tuesday morning the 16th, at 11:00 
am (Houston time) to update everyone on GENCO and answer any questions that 
you all may have and also to see where we stand on PPAs, models, PDAs, 
curves, etc.  I am sitting down with Delainey and Donahue on Wednesday to 
talk about all the above and I need to be in a position to send out 
preliminary info late Wednesday or early Thursday to interested parties.  

I will schedule a call-in number.  Please let me know if this works for you.

Thanks,

Ben:

I am not sure that Swati from Duke understands what the payment schedule 
represents.  First of all, the property tax payments for assessment years 
2000 - 2009 range from a high of $590K to $490K and are not close to the 
numbers he feels are reflected by the schedule. 

 Property tax payments for any given assessment year in Mississippi are paid 
in January of the year following the year of assessment.  For example, the 
property taxes for the 2000 year assessment year are paid in January 2001 and 
the payment schedule reflects that ($591,200).  The other figure that shows 
in the column are property taxes for that year to be paid in the following 
year.

The 15% ratio of assessment has been taken into account in the calculation 
and the payments for the year are total estimated taxes for the year 
including the payment-in-lieu-of taxes payment ("PILOT").

The document for the PILOT agreement has been supplied to the Duke Property 
Tax Department.  Have Swati contact Kelly Voelkel for any information he 
needs.

If additional information is necessary please contact me at X-30689.

Warren

I spoke to Aquila again today.  They are planning to submit bids on Friday
for Gleason, Wheatland and Pastoria.  They already have a tolling agreement
in the Lincoln area and don't want more capacity there.

Aquila's question:

They questioned the development costs for Pastoria - look very high.  I
noted that it includes the ERC's.  They would like a breakout of the
development costs


PG&E's question is below.  Are you comfortable disclosing this at this stage
or is this a phase II due diligence item?

Since we do not have to accept the NEPCO contract, can you break out the
cost and scope of equipment (Enron uses the term "power islands")?  Can we
get this information tomorrow?  Both cost and scope of this is important to
be able to assess the "EPC" price and determine bid price.

Is the major maintenance reserve estimate based on a negotiated Long Term
Services Agreement (LTSA)?  If so, will it be in place and transfer with
PEF?

Are spare parts for the first major overhaul included anywhere in the
capital cost estimate or are they assumed to be purchased through the
maintenance reserve estimate (i.e. the LTSA) charge?

Ben, 

Here is the first cut of Wheatland. I did not reflect all comments from Mike 
since I think we need to sit down with Don tomorrow morning before we make 
any structural changes. We will decide tomorrow regarding how we present key 
sales point - general to all peakers vs specific to each peakers and other 
things. Thanks.

1.  What are the short term NOx and CO emissions during startups, and are
there limitations during start-ups.

Normally, there is a short period during startup when the NOx goes to 
approximately 35 ppm.  This is very short in duration and occurs while the 
gas turbine is loading.  Our site is permitted to normally operate between 
70-100% turbine load.  These emissions have subsided within the few minutes 
required to attain 70% load.  Our permit constraints require that we do not 
exceed our emissions limits on a 3 hour rolling avarage.  Therefore these 
short-term startup emissions are not an issue.  

CO is a calculated value.  I do not have short-term CO2 numbers at present.  
However, I don't believe they are at issue since they are related to excess 
air which is pretty high during startup.

There is a condition called lean-lean firing which can and has occured from 
time to time.  A transition takes place above 40MW when the nozzle gas 
arrangement normally goes to a firing state called "premix steady state."  If 
this transition fails for some reason, the machine goes into a lean-lean 
state and the NOx level can rise to 40-50 ppm.  The turbine activates and 
operator alarm when this happens.  We can count the number of occurances that 
this has happened on one hand at Caledonia.  When this conditions occurs, the 
operators correct the condition by reducing the load to about 35MW and then 
increase the load again.  Typically this resolves the faulty transition and 
it configures the nozzles correctly on the second attempt.



2.  Are industrial stormwater permits required at either site?

No industrial stormwater permit is required at Caledonia.



3.  In Caledonia, what is the custom fuel sampling schedule?

The fuel sampling schedule for both sulphur content and heating value at 
Caledonia is once per month.

Pat Cathers

1. Do the cost of linears (gas, transmission, and system upgrades)
include tax grossups relating thereto?

2. Is the cost of backup power (for startup and station service)
included in the variable O&M estimate or is it included in one of the fixed
charges.  Please tell us where it is and how much it is expected to be
annually.

Ross, please review this answer.  I have not seen any cost analysis with the 
NPDES and water upgrade.  Cinergy is concerned as are most over the water 
cost issues.  Ben/Don, lake and property issues and permit issues should go 
to Keenan and Kellermeyer.

As I read it, the only potential action item that involves me directly has to 
do with a KVB Enertec purchase order.  I am not sure which one you are 
addressing.  I also sould direct you to Jim Meyer on this.  

We do receive from time to time copies of POs but typically we submit 
Purchase Requests and Jim issues the POs.  Depending on the service or item 
we may need to have a copy of the PO on site.  But typically we ask Jim for 
it when applicable.  He has copies of all POs and would just need to know 
which one you want.

Thanks,

Subject: Schedule Updates


Mitch,

There are a few items on which I need your input in order to update the
schedules for Brownsville and Caledonia.  Stuart has asked me to follow
up with you.

In re: Brownsville

I am still waiting on certain purchase orders from KVB Intertech and
Seimens (for telephone support), as well as any others that may be out
there.

"Mitchell/Ross, please have them faxed to my office number at 713-345-7384.  
Time has become more critical.  In order to save time, please also fax copies 
directly to Roger's office - - the fax number is below"

In re: Caledonia

I am also waiting on a purchase order from KVB Intertech, as well as any
others that may be out there.

"Pat/Ross, please fax to my office and directly to Roger"

Further, I am waiting on some spill info for Schedule 4.1(n),
Environmental Matters, of Caledonia.  Specifically, I need a blurb to
insert into the schedule.

"Already sent by Gus.  Let me know if you need anything else."

Also, on Schedule 7.12, Stuart stated that you are preparing some
updated to Excluded Assets for Caledonia.

"Pat, you stated in our conference call that there were some items that might 
have been at the plant that were of a personal nature and therefore would not 
be included in the asset sale.  In general, if they are low dollar (e.g. 
$500), then I don't believe you need to specifically exclude them.  This 
isn't meant to be a big deal; what I don't want to have happen is the buyer 
gets the plant and remembers a large drill press was at the plant and isn't 
anymore because it was your personal press.  Make sense??"


Finally, I am not clear on what to do on Schedule 4.1(v) on Caledonia in
regard to the defective blades as well as to some problem with the
(Westinghouse) bearings.  I need blurbs to insert into the Schedules.  I
have seen some documentation via e-mail, but do not know how these items
should be described in the Schedules.

"Had a discussion with a bidder this morning.  I recommend the following 
blurb.  Please review from a legal stand point and advise. - - - Though the 
generator bearings are operating correctly, the Brownsville turbine vendor 
has implemented an upgrade to these bearings at other plants.  Enron will 
make commercially reasonably efforts to get the vendor to conduct this 
upgrade as a warranty item. - - - The Caledonia turbine vendor has recently 
issued a Technical Information Letter (TIL) that could limit turbine 
operations during low ambient conditions.  Enron will make commercially 
reasonable efforts prior to deal closing to implement the control curve 
changes recommended in the TIL - - - Enron will continue to make commercially 
reasonable efforts to install new silencers on the exhaust of units 1 and 2 
at Brownsville in an attempt to mitigate possible start-up noise.  Enron will 
provide XXXXXXX copies of technical descriptions of the silencer improvements 
once received from the vendor.  If vendors provide possible solutions that 
substantially deviate from a silencer upgrade, Enron will get xxxxxxx's 
concurence prior to proceeding.  Enron will cover the cost of the silencer 
upgrade up to $500,000, and Enron will make commercially reasonable efforts 
to complete the upgrade prior to June 1, 2000.  If the upgrade completion is 
not likely to occur prior to June 1, 2000, Enron will get xxxxxx's 
concurrence prior to proceeding."


Please update me at your earliest possible convenience as we are still
in negotiations with the counterparty and may be executing this
agreement this weekend.

Please call me with any questions.

Thanks.

Gus,

I spoke with Mr. Jack Wade, TDEC concerning the Multi-Sector General Permit 
for Construction, New Storm Water Permit and NOV Status at Brownsville Power..
 
The Multi-Sector General Permit was issued for construction in lieu of Storm 
Water Permit by TDEC direction on August 7, 1998
If by July 1, 2000 the construction activities were not complete, BPI would 
have had to transfer the TMGP to a new Storm Water Permit for Construction 
that was promulgated this summer.  
 The soil erosion control & countermeasures taken and completed by BPI on 
June 15, 2000 has completely satisfied TDEC  concerns outlined in the NOV's 
dated 2-28-99 and 5-1-00.   Mr. Wade asked my opinion of vegetative 
stablization, which was the last condition by TDEC before allowing BPI to 
terminate the construction permit,  I responded that, in my opinion, the 
stablization throughout the facility was excellent.


I have attached a "Draft" letter to TDEC requesting the termination of the 
TMGP.  Please review and comment at your earliest convenience.

Respectfully Mitchell

My responses to one set of PG&E questions would be as follows.  Dean is 
answering the other one and will send back to you directly.

* What is Enron's intent re: continuing involvement?  PG&E is
concerned about any potential requirements that they might be required to
either purchase fuel from Enron or engage Enron as the power marketer.

RESPONSE: Enron is very flexible re continuing involvement:  scheduling 
coordination, fuel supply, power marketing, etc.  We are also flexible re the 
time period and the terms of the continuing involvement.  Whatever 
arrangement is developed would be mutually beneficial.



* What is status of EPC negotiations.  Will they be required to engage
NEPCO as the EPC contractor?  Does the EPC contractor have control over the
turbines?

RESPONSE: o EPC negotiations are complete with NEPCO.  Contract has not been 
executed, but has been "put on the shelf" awaiting decision on successful 
bidder for the purchase of the Pastoria project from ENA.  Successful bidder 
and NEPCO will each have the option of executing the EPC agreement.

  o Successful bidder is under no obligation to engage NEPCO.

  o West LB has control of the turbines.  They can be assigned either to the 
LLC or to ENA.  (If assigned to ENA, it was because the successful bidder for 
the Pastoria project did not want the turbines with the acquisition.)  If 
assigned to the LLC as part of the acquisition, the LLC can then assign the 
turbines to the ultimate EPC contractor.   



* They also questioned whether there would be any "agricultural
restrictions"?

RESPONSE: The project site is presently under a Williamson Act contract to 
maintain agricultural use in exchange for lower taxes.  Last week, the Kern 
County Board of Supervisors voted to cancel the Williamson Act contract to 
allow for industrial use, which started a 180 day public comment period.  
However, the Governor has on his desk a bill for signature that would reduce 
the public comment period for the cancellation to the same time frame as the 
request for rehearing period for the CEC Final Decision.  (The Governor has 
until 9/30 sign the bill and is expected to do so because of the overwhelming 
support of the bill in the Assembly and the Senate.)  The cancellation will 
be contingent upon a successful CEC decision and a payment of a Williamson 
Act cancellation fee.

Please refer to the attached powerpoint slide as part of the general 
explanation below.

The remote terminal unit (RTU) system monitors our high voltage equipment 
status.  This includes the telemetering and revenue equipment required to be 
a Control Area.  The RTU's provide information that is identical to both 
utilities (Control Areas).  We have used the L&G protocol on all of the RTU's 
to date.

The Scada Management Platform (SMP) is connected to the unit control system 
(DCS).  The SMP passes the setpoint that the Energy Management Systems, (EMS) 
Automatic Generation Control (AGC) application has calculated the required 
setpoint  ( dispatch) that is required to be meet by each unit. The local 
operator has to place each units local control system to the remote status 
for the setpoint to be accepted at the plant.  We have used the ESCA Inter 
Site Data (ISD) protocal on all of the SMP systems to date.

 The SMP  also provides us with an alternate data source which is required as 
a Control Area.  

Thanks.

Your math seems correct to me. Keep that in mind our NI includes PPA value

Regarding Question #8 on the Wheatland section...
 LMS-MA is a service we did not elect to participate in - therefore the 
number in the 'blank' that
was illegible was zero.  We keep all balances on OBA - which has no daily 
charges and a mth end cashout.

Regarding question #8:
   
   Wheatland has a zero for "DDQ" under our LMS-MA balancing agreement 
because Wheatland has elected not to have storage
  or "swing" rights associated with the LMS-MA service.   If Wheatland would 
have elected the storage option associated with the LMS-MA
  schedule, a number > zero would have been entered and would constitute the 
amount of "swing" in which variance charges would be 
  assessed.

I am pleased to announce that yesterday (May 3) we closed the sale of the Wheatland, Gleason and Lincoln peaker plants to Allegheny. The completion of this LONG transaction was truly a team effort!  We are currently planning a closing celebration, and I will follow up with the details.

Thanks again for everyone's contribution.

(Sorry for the day delay in the announcement but as you know Outlook was down yesterday)

Ben,

Would you please forward to Dale copies of the CA's that were signed by those 
parties which will be given second round access to the LV CoGen docs?  His 
fax number is listed below. Many thanks.  

Stuart


By the way, I hope that you are continuing to obtain executed originals of 
the CA's (and sending them to Ed Hearn upon receipt thereof).

I probably should get copies of the executed agreements.  My fax is (503) 
464-8058.

Thanks.

Dale,

I will follow up with Ed to be sure that he is able to get you the form (in 
electronic format) that we used.  Be advised, however, that many of the 
parties attempted to negotiate the form.  While I didn't let them get away 
with much, some concessions were made.  If you would like copies of the 
executed confidentiality agreements for certain parties, I can get those for 
you as well.

Stuart

Your Round II Schedule indicates that the data room availability is October
6 to October 30.  Can the use of the Data Room be extended to the bid due
date of November 3 to facilitate members of our team who are working out of
the data room directly in preference to printing hard copies of required
materials?

First of all, our operations representative, Barry O'Brien, mentioned how
pleasant and congenial your employees are at the plant. Thank you for your
hospitality.

Don, we would like some additional information as follows:
Could you please provide a complete asset listing that will be conveyed to
the new owner (including spare parts).


Questions

* There are currently 12 permanent staff assigned to Wheatland. Is
this a requirement due to switchyard interconnects or any other contractual
requirements?

* Do we understand that you are entering into a switchyard maintenance
contract for five years? If so, may we have a copy and what is the annual
cost?

* Are you willing to enter into an agreement to provide turbine
maintenance after the warranty?

Mitch - I took out the first sentence from your answer to question #1. The 
CFR you wanted to refer to is part 60 and not part 75. In any case, I really 
do not think that the part 60 NSPS Subpart GG  limit of 98 ppm applies during 
startup and shut down. I believe that we are covered by the provisions of 
part 60 Subchapter A, Section 60.11(d) which calls only for good air 
pollution control practice to minimize emissions during startup and shutdown.

No short term emission limits apply during startup and shutdown. The only 
issue with startup and shut down emissions is that they get counted toward 
your total emissions for the year, and you certainly covered this issue in 
your last paragraph to question #1.

The revised file is attached.

Gus

Don, based on our conference call last week and the fax sent to me, I am
still in need of the following:
* The air permit to construct application as submitted to IDEM and any
correspondence related to the application.  I do not need the actual permit
as issued by IDEM.
* Petition for Alternate testing.  The cover page was faxed.  Dave
Kellermeyer was to Fed Ex the remainder.  If this has been done, let me
know.  I will have to track it down.
* Determination of EPCRA reporting requirements for lead acid
batteries.

Additionally, we discussed yesterday a request for any analytical data
associated with the Lake Acquisition property, particularly sediment samples
from the lake bottom.

Thanks for your help.

ACTIVISION LANDS HIGH SCORE
Activision tops estimates. Game on!

By Rick Aristotle Munarriz

The game's afoot for software specialist Activision (Nasdaq:
ATVI). The popular video game maker trounced analyst estimates
like a Quake baddie in one of its console ports.
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=165621

Earnings more than quadrupled to $0.17 a share, a stunning eight
cents above Wall Street projections. Revenues climbed by 25% to
$144.4 million with the peak holiday shopping season right
around the corner.

But, as we noted last week, delays in mass shipments of the
highly anticipated PlayStation 2 might hose down some of that
red-hot momentum with the video game powerhouses. Without enough
systems to meet seasonal demand, and few gamers willing to
stockpile games for platforms on the way out, how will
Activision perform?
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=165622

The company is now hiking its annual bottom-line forecast by
seven cents to $0.63 a share. The only problem is that the
company used up eight of those upwardly revised coppers this
past quarter. That means that the game maker is looking to fall
a penny short in either the December or March reporting period.

That might happen later rather than sooner. Since mid-September
the company's Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 has been the top-selling
title for the top-selling PlayStation system. While we are now
just two days away from the PlayStation
2 launch, the extreme skating title should continue to roll
along nicely in the near term.

Activision -- the subject of StockTalk last April -- is the
country's second-largest developer of game console software,
behind only Electronic Arts (Nasdaq: ERTS). The company is
looking for flat growth over the year ahead but a 50% spike come
calendar year 2002.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=165623

So the past looks great. The long-term appears equally aglow.
It's the near-term that might have investors fumbling for the
pause button.

NEWS TO GO

Winning the battle but Lucent (NYSE: LU) the war, the
telecommunications titan reported earnings of $0.18 a share, a
penny above estimates. The problem? Analysts were looking for a
$0.29 showing before the company gave Wall Street downward
guidance due to soft equipment sales. That prompted the bar
being lowered to a height of $0.17 a share. Over the weekend,
the company's board of directors fired its CEO. Reserve the
right to do the same to anyone who naively tells you that Lucent
is back on track because it topped fourth-quarter projections.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=165624
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=165625

Twenty-five million Welcomes. This morning America Online (NYSE:
AOL) announced that it reached the 25 million subscriber mark
for its namesake online service. It was simply a matter of time
-- and of scatter software marketing -- since the company had
announced that it had 24.6 million users at the end of the
September quarter. On the merger front, today's Wall Street
Journal is reporting that the review deadline for its Time
Warner (NYSE: TWX) acquisition has been extended by two weeks.
The stateside antitrust authorities continue to ponder the
ramifications of the mega media merger.

National Semiconductor (NYSE: NSM) is laying its chips on the
table and the stock is falling as it may. The company has warned
that its second and third quarters might fall short of its
fiscal first-quarter showing. The company earned $0.76 a share
on $640 million in revenues for the period.

It was another "pfine" quarter for Pfizer (NYSE: PFE). The
pharmaceuticals powerhouse reported earnings of $0.27 a share on
revenues of $7.2 billion. The results came in two cents ahead of
expectations. For the year, the company is comfortable with
targets of $30 billion in revenue and $1.01 a share in earnings.

All of you continue to play a key role in the success of the sale of the 
Peakers, LVI & II and Pastoria.  A number of different parties are currently 
reviewing the book. Since we haven't had a chance to gather as a group 
recently, I thought it might be beneficial to send out an email highlighting 
the schedule over the next several weeks and months.

This week and next, we will be finalizing the due diligence room, the terms 
of the purchase and sale agreements (PSA), the management presentation and a 
lot of other stuff.  First round bids due a week from this Friday, on Sept. 
29.    The week of Oct. 2,  we will be notifying those bidders that will 
advance to Round 2 and we will be sending out the PSA.  The week of Oct. 9, 
the real fun will begin with management presentations, due diligence room 
opening and site visits.  The key people involved in these activities should 
work to keep their schedules as flexible as possible from Oct. 9 - Nov 3. We 
need to think about who can do plant tours, give presentations, etc given 
that the most logical people may be giving the management presentation, 
answering questions, and/or unavailable to lead the plant tour.  It is our 
hope and expectations that we will have multiple bidders to juggle in this 
process.  It is going to be a balancing act and I encourage everyone to begin 
to think through people and process.  The schedule then has us selecting our 
preferred purchaser(s) the week of Nov. 6, with a December 18, 2000 closing!

I believe we have identified and dealt with many of the legal, accounting, 
tax and financing (unwind) issues surrounding the sale.  If people are aware 
of other related issues, please let me know so that we can deal with them 
ASAP.

Thanks again for everyone's help thus far.  If by chance you don't have a 
copy of the Info Memo, let me know and I will get a copy out to you pronto. 
Let me know if you all have any questions.

Regards,

Don

Our team is now working hard on answering your questions by Friday.  I 
apologize for the difficulty you are experiencing with DealBench.  We will be 
sending you the documents on CDs later today.  Don Miller will call you later 
to discuss.

		 Subject: Due Diligence Questions


Gentlemen,

Attached is a list of due diligence questions for the Enron generation
assets (Wheatland, Lincoln, Gleason and LV Cogen).  We would very much
appreciate your help is getting answers for by Friday, 10/20 if possible.

Unfortunately, we are still having significant difficulty in accessing
documents on DealBench.  The download time is usually several minutes to a
half hour per document and often the larger documents will not fully print
out on our systems.  Two of our consultants have experienced similar
difficulties which suggests that whatever problems we are facing are not
unique to systems at PECO.

We are concerned that the limited information will impact our ability to
bid on the assets.  Would it be possible to receive from you either a print
out of the documents or the documents on CD ROM?

Mike Cazaubon

Don:

The questions that I was unable to answer for Excelon (PECO) during the 
Lincoln site visit are as follows:

1.  What is the gas consumption per unit during start-up?

2.  What is the reference # for the 2nd ComEd Interconnection Feasibility 
Study?  Is this document on deal bench?

3.  Do any other parties have a right to interconnect to the Project's gas 
pipeline lateral?


My input to these questions is:

1.  None.  I am not familiar with this area.

2.  I saw this 2nd study is out on deal bench at least a week ago.  As long 
as it wasn't removed, it should be there.   I do not know the reference #.

3.  I do not believe that any other parties have a right to connect to the 
gas lateral owned by Des Plaines LLC.  (In fact,  I believe that we are 
statutorily prevented from supplying gas to other end users - Des Plaines LLC 
is neither an interstate pipeline nor a gas LDC).  Please confirm my opinion 
with Stuart/Chris Meyer to make sure that we have not granted any 
interconnection rights to Northern Border/Peoples.

Call me to discuss.

Fred

PG&E Gen is most interested in Pastoria and had several questions/concerns
that they asked about during my discussion with them:

* What is Enron's intent re: continuing involvement?  PG&E is
concerned about any potential requirements that they might be required to
either purchase fuel from Enron or engage Enron as the power marketer.
* What is status of EPC negotiations.  Will they be required to engage
NEPCO as the EPC contractor?  Does the EPC contractor have control over the
turbines?
* They also questioned whether there would be any "agricultural
restrictions"?

Mitch,

I spoke with Chris Meyer.  He said that hey should have asked for more 
detail, but only asked for total gas volumes moved.  As a first cut, let's go 
back with total volumes in 1999 and 2000 (broken out separately).  They may 
come back wanting more detail, but this will serve as a start.

Thanks,

Don

Thank you for participating in the meeting/conference call yesterday 
afternoon.  I know it was helpful to go through the Synthetic Lease 
assumptions with everyone on board.  I met with Dave yesterday evening and 
briefly discussed his timing (ASAP) on meeting with Joe Sutton and his 
expectations (very high) on the Moore presentation.  I referenced oversizing 
the amount of the Synthetic Lease in order to keep the Canadian banks happy 
on the 90% Enron guarantee.  He agreed that the economics in the dash should 
still reflect the lower actual amount to be drawn down (currently U.S. 
$169MM).  Please note below his requests and delegated responsibilities in 
(brackets) below: 

Dave requested I revise the proposal (Adam) to show add'l NPV and IRR 
comparisons based on MAIN, ComEd and possibly ICF, and a 30 Yr, GENCO 
comparison (Kate).  Given the recent downward shift in some of the curves we 
may need to recompute our existing NPV and IRR #'s also (Kate).  Besides 
furnishing a graph for the referenced curves, I need to submit GENCO's 
capital cost comparison for peakers in the marketplace (Ben).  Further, based 
on the 30 year amortization, I need to show a graph of the build up of the 
components of capacity price and a break even earnings accrual price 
(Miguel).  I will need comparisons from GENCO of these two graphs as well as 
a chart comparing start costs, heat rate and Var. O&M contrasting the Moore 
Project with the GENCO peakers (Don and/or Jynsung or Clement or Ben).  In 
addition, Dave asked to get a Draft copy of the DASH ASAP (Chip).  Dave does 
not want to circulate the DASH for signature until he has met with Sutton. 

Thanks for your help.  
Thomas.

Let me amend Fred's response to Question 1:

The Lincoln facility does not have an operating permit from Illinois EPA.  
Condition 10a of the construction permit allows operation of the facility up 
to the end of emission testing and Condition 10b allows continued operation 
after emission testing has been completed.  Also note that Condition 10c of 
the construction permit states that these conditions supercede Standard 
Condition 6, which requires the applicant to apply for a State operating 
permit.  In other words, the Lincoln facility does not need to hold a 
separate operating permit from the Illinois EPA.

Subject: Re: Lincoln Environmental Questions  

Ben:  

Here are my answers to the Allegheny Questions below.  Please confirm the 
details with Dave Kellermeyer where necessary.

Question 1:   Does the Lincoln facility have an air operating permit from the 
Illinois Environmental Protection Agency?  If so, please provide a copy. If 
not,    please explain status.

Answer:  I believe that the application for the Title V Operating Permit for 
the Lincoln Energy Center was submitted to the IEPA in the Spring of 2000.  
Dave   Kellermeyer can definitively answer whether this Operating Permit has 
been issued/received from the IEPA.

Question 2: Were any wetlands impacted by the construction of the facility 
and, if so, what permits were obtained?  Will any wetlands be impacted by 
future   expansion plans?  ENSR's conclusion on this issue seemed unclear, 
particularly with respect to the 30 acre parcel.  See 02.03.09C.

Answer:  The ENSR Wetlands Delineation activities conducted during the period 
of December 1998 through February 1999 determined the following:
   1.  No wetlands existed on the 50 acre parcel upon which the Lincoln 
Energy Center was ultimately constructed.
   2.  An agricultural wetland area existed within the parcel of land 
adjacent to the western boundary of the Lincoln Energy Center 50 acre    
parcel.
   3.  After reviewing the ENSR wetland delineation information, the Will 
County NRCS confirmed the existence and boundary location of the    
agricultural wetland and  concurred with the ENSR conclusion that the 
agricultural wetland boundary was completely contained within the    parcel 
of land adjacent to the western boundary of the Lincoln Energy Center 50 acre 
parcel.

With regard to wetlands impacted during construction of the Facility, the 
construction of the Facility's natural gas pipeline lateral was routed 
through several existing wetland areas.  The potential impact of this 
lateral's construction on existing wetlands was mitigated through a 
directional drilling program implemented during the pipeline construction 
activity.  The Site Development permits required for this pipeline 
construction activity were obtained from the Will County Land Use 
Department.  

With regard to future Facility expansion plans, no impact to wetlands is 
expected provided that such expansion occurs within the existing boundaries 
of the 50 acre Facility parcel.

As a note to Question 2 above, I could not locate a reference to a 30 acre 
parcel within the ENSR Wetland Investigation Report described as 02.03.09C.  
Perhaps this is a typo and should be 50 acres.

Call/see me to discuss this information.  I will be in the office tomorrow 
(10/24) until 2 pm and then in Chicago on Wed-Thursday.  I will access my 
email via laptop while I am out of the office.

Fred

Gentlemen,

Attached is a list of due diligence questions for the Enron generation
assets (Wheatland, Lincoln, Gleason and LV Cogen).  We would very much
appreciate your help is getting answers for by Friday, 10/20 if possible.

Unfortunately, we are still having significant difficulty in accessing
documents on DealBench.  The download time is usually several minutes to a
half hour per document and often the larger documents will not fully print
out on our systems.  Two of our consultants have experienced similar
difficulties which suggests that whatever problems we are facing are not
unique to systems at PECO.

We are concerned that the limited information will impact our ability to
bid on the assets.  Would it be possible to receive from you either a print
out of the documents or the documents on CD ROM?

Ben, thanks for getting back so quickly with comments on the Confidentiality
Agreement.  Attached is a revised draft of the agreement blacklined from the
May 10 draft to show the changes you and I discussed and some slight
modification to address the concern I expressed to you.

I am enclosing a clean version of the blacklined agreement.  If the changes
are acceptable, please print out two originals for execution by ENA and
overnight to me for execution by Cinergy.  Please call me if you have any
questions or comments.

I have placed a call to Bo Buchynsky of Diamond Energy (Mitsubishi's US 
subsidiary) to see if they are interested.  They tried to bid Pittsburg, but 
their partner Mission bagged them at the last minute so they backed out.  We 
tried to marry them to Avista, as they both seemed to lack partners at the 
time, but that did not work out.  Several months ago, Bo contacted me to 
indicate that they were in the market for projects and wanted to be kept on 
our lists for contact when opportunities were available. I will contact Bo 
and assess continued interest and get a current address.

I think you got all the rest of the companies I thought of.  I also asked 
David Kates, who also thought of no more.

Thanks for the response.  We had previously received the response regarding
the SPCC plan issue but I had not seen the responses for the Lincoln
facility (although I had received Gleason last week).  Just to confirm what
is outstanding:  The questions relating to all facilities sent on 10/23,
the questions relating to Wheatland sent on 10/23, the questions relating
to LV Cogen I and II sent on 10/23, and the questions relating to the LV
Cogen I and II schedules sent on 10/25.  Please let me know if this is not
consistent with your understanding of what is outstanding.  Thanks.

P.S.  You had also indicated in your 10/25 email that the letter from TDEC
regarding the Subpart GG variance would be faxed to me.  To date, I have
not yet received it.  Thanks.

As we have done with El Paso, Aquila and Duke; is it possible for us (Tax) to

Thanks again for your help with this critical part of the sales process.  We 
will begin the plant site visits this Thursday.  Ben Rogers (3-7998) is 
co-ordinating this and will be contacting you.

Confidentiality

I know it goes without saying,  but all aspects of the bidding process are to 
be kept confidential.  This means that no one can disclose to another bidder 
or any other person: the name of any bidder, the number of bidders, any 
questions asked, or comments made, by any bidder. 

If you have any questions regarding a confidentiality issue, or any other 
issue please contact me or Ben or Stuart Zisman.  Please highlight this with 
the plant managers as well

Site Visit Procedures

The attached Site Visit Procedures and cover letter were distributed to the 
Round II bidders last week.  Please read them carefully and to the extent a 
bidder moves outside of them, remind them of the procedures and have the 
bidder redirect the question to our banker, Credit Suisse First Boston.  
Should you have any questions, please call me.  

Also, you should have received a copy of the Information Memorandum that went 
out to all of the bidders.  If you don't have a copy, please call me and I 
will forward. I have also attached a copy of the presentation which each 
bidder will view online.  Please review both so that we can be consistent in 
our message.

Our internal site visit procedures will be as follows.   As Ben receives site 
visit requests, he will notify you all to establish the correct Site Visit 
Co-ordinator for the plant  and to set date and time of visit.

He will receive from each bidder, and will forward to the correct Site Visit 
Co-ordinator, a list of attendees (with a contact number for the bidder's 
site visit co-ordinator) and the hotel and travel information, as applicable.

Please call me should you have any questions.  I want you all to feel very 
comfortable in your role as Site Visit Co-ordinator  Please call me with any 
questions.

Thanks.

Ben,

I spoke to Ross Newlin regarding the vibration problems.  The Westinghouse 
engineers corrected the problem to the point that it was below alarm limits.  
There is no plan to repair the problem during the November outage since it 
requires significant run time and the economics are not there for a November 
run.  However, West. has committed to come back to the plant in January when 
we can schedule some run time.  Ross will try to track down the minutes of 
the outage planning meeting to document this.  I'll forward them to you when 
I get them.

George,

Thanks for the note and the message. I will try to call you later today, but
will send this note just in case I miss you.

While I am interested in following up with Tim about our project in the NW,
there are two other more pressing reasons for talking with the right guys at
Enron. First, we have just secured the rights to a 1600 MW plant in Texas -
permitting complete and just about ready for financing. We are also close to
securing the rights to a 800 MW project in Oklahoma. So we would like to
talk about tolling, etc. for both of those plants.

Also, word on the street is that Enron is not only selling existing
generating stations, but also its projects under development. I think I saw
a report that your CEO denied this. But, if there is any truth in the
statement, we would like to follow up, especially concerning the development
sites. It may be possible for us to take over development and have a tie
back to Enron for the marketing (and perhaps the operations) of the project.

Hope you are enjoying London,

Cheers,

Chuck

Please contact Chuck to discuss the details.  Thanks.

I am in London this week and can be reached at 44-20-7783-4160 if either of

Thomas and or Mike may have already asked you this, but I want to make sure 
we're all on the same page (or determine if I'm not). In order to support the 
greenfield merchant decision making process for '01, we need price forecasts 
for the following locations / configurations:

1. Florida - 6 - LM6000s in simple cycle mode; 6 - LM 6000s plus a 74.9MW 
steam turbine in combined cycle mode
2. St. Charles Parrish, LA (south of N.O.) 6 - LM6000s in simple cycle mode
3. Chicago area: 2 - ABB 11N2s in simple cycle mode; 6 - LM 6000s in simple

with the consultants after you make the intro...

Thanks much,

Ben and Jinsung,

Below are my calculations for run-hours and annual MWs.  The starts/year is 
an estimate and fuel use/start are estimates only.  I would say that these 
estimates are conservative and are used to make sure that emissions are kept 
below limits. 

Rick


 Heat Rate Basis:
 Unit 1 & 2 - 11,200
 Unit  3 & 4 - 11,800

 Output Basis:
 Unit 1 & 2 - 115 MW
 Unit 3 & 4 - 125 MW

 Emissions Limits:
 NOx - 249 tons/yr
 CO - 225 tons/yr
 Fuel - 7,127,857 MMBtu/yr

Dave, we made a small change in the order of the presentation.  We swithched 
the next to last sections so Other Acquisition Issues is before California 
Power Market.  Also, the Labor Agreement slide has change based on my 
conversation with Rick Johnson.  

Sam and Dave, if you have notes you will follow, please forward them to 
Sheila and Karen to assist them in their review of your voice-over.

Please call if you have any questions or comments.

Subject:  Property tax - Caledonia

Doc 01.07.02  - Talks about a 15% assessment for as valorem taxes.
Doc 01.07.02.01 - Property tax estimates - estimates from 2001-2019  (tax +
pilot payments) are $1M a year till 2009 and then to ~$1.4 M for next few
years beg 2010, dropping back down to $700K level.

In 2000, the property tax was just $500K, as there seems to be no pilot
payment until Jan 2001.

My questions are -
   Confirm that the 15% assessment in first doc is included in the estimate
   The schdule of estimated payments is all inclusive of the payments
   relating to property taxes
   Refer me to doc that talks about the pilot agreement or any other tax
   abatement docs

Thanks.

Dave Delainey has requested feedback on all the interested parties by this 
Friday.  If you have recently made contact with your respective company(s), 
please drop me a line and let me know the latest.  If no contact has been 
made recently, please call and see how things are going.  All of these 
companies should have had books for a week plus.  As you all are aware, bids 
are due a week from Friday.  I am unsure who ultimately made the contact with 
some of these companies, so I have bunched them together.  If there are some 
companies that I haven't included, but that you have feedback on, please let 
me know what it is.  Thanks for all your help, and it looks like the real fun 
is just around the corner.

Subject: Comparison

My comparison stops at Operating Margin because our analysis is done on a 
pretax basis and the debt service schedule are identical.  The primary 
difference is due to their assumptions with regards to annual merchant sales 
of available capacity after meeting contractual requirements.  We tried to 
value the merchant sales and it dragged down the value of the plants so we 
left it at 0.  Not suprisingly they are more bullish about their ability to 
sale the available electrons.  Take a look at the attachment and if you have 
any questions my cell # is (713)503-3107.  Thanks!

Attached please find the weekly cost report.  The only material change is a 
reduction in Gleason Start-up Fuel/Power.  A credit for the sale of power was 
not booked against the project until after closing.  I am working with Ben 
Jacoby, Fred Mitro, and Chris Booth to review Estimate to Complete and Total 
Projects.   We are focusing in on a couple of areas, one being the 
Westinghouse Turbines.  We have withheld money for Liquidated Damage claims 
for both Wheatland and Gleason.

Additionally, we have scheduled the final Nepco audit for August 28th - 
30th.  We will be reviewing actuals, estimate to complete and ultimately the 
final forecast.  


Please call if you have any questions.  Thanks Amy 3-7805

I've finished with Wilton Center.  Here's my highlighted index.  Once again, 
I've probably included too many documents (land, rough cost estimates, etc).

Tomorrow I'll get started on the '99s.  Hopefully we can get a fairly quick 
turnaround on these to get scanned in again.  If we can get these documents 
skimmed through in two days (tomorrow and Wednesday), we should be in good 
shape to get everything scanned in and done by Friday.  Keep your fingers 
crossed.

There is only one quarterly report required for Brownsville. This is the EPA 
electronic data report (EDR) which we generate from the CEMS system and 
submit electronically to the EPA. 

Mitchell - Since you are generating the 3rd quarter reports to the EPA today, 
would you please copy Ben on the submittal. Thanks.

The attached files contain the info.

1) do the capital cost of linears (gas, transmission and system upgrades)
include tax gross ups relating thereto?

2) Is the cost of backup power (for startup and station service) included in
the variable O&M estimate, or is it included in one of the fixed charges.
Please tell us where it is and how much it is expected to be annually?

Thanks.

Subject: Dave Delainey's Additional Requests

As per the presentation with Dave yesterday and a follow up conversation with 
him today, we need the following:

Kate:   Run the model based on the "break even cost #'s" in comparison to 
GENCO's #'s assuming a 6 1/2% fixed interest 
  rate. (As per Dave Don Miller's GENCO group should be able to supply us 
with their comparable #'s).
 Also run the model based on MAIN and ECAR curves ( we have already run the 
#'s on Cinergy and West NY).   
 Produce a graph showing the different curves, including ICF-Kaiser.  
 Also show a graph comparing Moore's tariff build up (based on the 30 yr 
curve) for Fixed and Variable O&M,    principal, interest. etc.  (Jonathan 
Hoff should be of great help here).

Miguel:  Get market comps from the Confidential-CSFB study that Don Miller 
has giving Asset Pricing comps for Power   Plants (GENCO related).  Also look 
to get any other market/asset sales info. we showed to Orion.
 Meet with the desk to get the MAIN and ECAR curves Dave has requested we 
run. (for Kate's proforma).  
 Since Miguel is out after Thursday, Adam  should coordinate and follow up in 
Miguel's absence.

He also gave us go ahead for the DASH and RAROC. Kate was cleaning up the 
DASH and the model to pass on to  Underwriting.

Joe D. and Lisa B. are following up on the Syn. Lease structure getting with 
the banks.  

Eric will of course address all the other issues including technical, 
transmission interface, turbine purchase, permitting, etc.

As you know, Dave wanted this done in tandem with all the other development 
projects, which means ASAP.

Thanks, Thomas.

I am unsure of the direction Ross would like for me to take with the Central

people associated with New Albany.  If Ross would like for it to be listed as 
two, let me know and it will be no problem to generate the second chart.  Let

Ben:

I have been able to locate a copy of the Peoples Energy letter we were 
looking for last week.  I still need to obtain copies of the "as built" 
drawings for the pipeline lateral.  These drawings were in one of the last 
groups of documents which I sent to the data room.  

Please locate these drawings and have copies sent up to Stuart Zisman.  Aaron 
Roffwarg at Bracewell & Patterson will send these copies to ComEd so that 
they may record their easement and we can then obtain our title policy on the 
pipeline lateral (this is needed for sale purposes).

I will be in Chicago tomorrow and Friday.  I will be on vacation Monday and 
in Chicago Tuesday.  I will be back in the Houston office on Wednesday of 
next week.

Thanks for you attention to this matter.

Fred

Attached is a redlined draft of the CA which includes the comments that I 
received from both Lance Schuler and Mark Metts.

Lance raised a very good point about the value of the standstill to Enron if 
ENA is a signatory to the agreement.  I will call Mark directly to discuss 
this issue but have attempted to highlight it for you in the revised draft.

Please feel free to call with any questions.

I have hard coded all volmes, prices and revenues related to merchant sales.  
A blend of Hennwood and our desk curves were used to price the merchant or 
excess sales.  I am also using a 9% discount rate which is what FPL had in 
the model they sent over to us.  We may want to take this out entirely and 
let them do their own.

Be prepared the model that I had to work with was 14 Mbs and a big mess.  I 
have cut it down to around 4 Mbs but the cash flow sheet is confusing 
at best.  It is manageable and should be sufficient.  Give me a call with any 
questions.

Don:

To confirm that we have scheduled a nominal two hour call on Monday (10/30)
at 1:30 CST to warp up the Peaker operational due diligence.  Duke has
arranged for a call in number  800/473-8492.  The conference host is Joe
Synnott.

Our focus on this call will be to review the status of our outstanding
requests and open questions.  An example of the former category are the
inspection reports at Gleason and the gas questions.  In the latter
category we still have some confusion about the units actual vs. guaranteed
performance data, status of the warranty items, historic transmission
performance, and relationship between the facility operations team and the
asset management function in Houston.    In addition our insurance staff
will be participating and will have some questions about the casualty loss
histories at the facilities.

Organizationally: please make available people on your team knowledgeable
in the operation and asset management of the facilities.  I would suggest
Ross, the plant managers, Mitch, and your environmental team.

Any questions, please don't hesitate to give me a call at 713-627-6579.

I just want to give everyone my idea on how we will maintain DealBench to 
catch up with LiveLink.

Tonight I will finish moving files from LiveLink to "O" drive for 6 peaker 
projects. Once I move everything to "O" drive, I need to do following two 
things to maintain DealBench.

Update files from "To be filed" folder since every file to go to "Due 
Diligence" folder goes to "To be filed" folder first.
Jon: Please let me know whenever you move files from "Project Files" to "Due 
Diligence" and whenever you delete files in "Due Diligence".

I think this process should allow me to make sure that DealBench files are 
same as LiveLink files. Let me know if you find any hole in this process. 
Thanks.

I have scheduled a call at 10:00 Houston time on Monday to talk with ICF 
about a new curve for LV, Pastoria, Louisiana, Florida and Missouri.  They 
have said that they can get a preliminary curve to us within 3-5 days with a 
full market study to follow.  For this, they have ask for $95M.  They usually 
charge $37,500 per region, and usually give us a 12% discount for a total of 
$33,000.  So in their minds, they are shaving off $70M from the standard 
discounted price. 

Let's talk before the call if at all possible. We need to be in a position to 
give them the go ahead on Monday, if we are comfortable with the proposal.  
Otherwise, we risk not getting the results until the following week.

Thanks,

Don

1)  Change "Start of Construction" to "Start of Construction and Engineering"
2)  Change Testing date from December 2002 to January 2002.

so that I can walk thru with you how the model works and how to update it

Here are the highlighted versions of the plants I've gone through.  I'm sure 
that not all the info I've flagged needs to be pulled, but I'm not sure 
exactly what the guidelines are for whether information is sensitive or not, 
so I tried to flag it all and let someone more knowledgeable than myself make 
that call.

I'm due to arrive back in Houston at 9:00 this evening (space permitting).  
I'll plan to be in late tomorrow morning (11:00 or 12:00) to continue the 
fun.  See you tomorrow.

I can be reached here for the next hour or so at 503-464-7751.

PS.  Jinsung, be careful when boxing up the stuff in my desk!  I'll bring in

Don,

For response #3, I have additional comments:

The ambient conditions were such that output was limited by the MW limiter in 
the WDPF.  Unit #3 was only operated at 96.2% of base load.  Since the 
guarantees were met during the test, no additional testing was done.

1.  The correction curves are not published with the Test Reports.  The 
calculations are given using the correction data only.  The curves and 
detailed explanations are located in the purchase contracts.

2. The run hours are estimated based on the emissions limits, the guaranteed 
emissions output of the equipment and average heat rates.   

 For example at Wheatland:

 The NOx cap is 249 tons/year * 2000 = 498,000 lbs./yr.  (permit limits)
 The NOx output of each unit is 0.092lbs /MMBtu  (Mfg. guarantee)
 The Fuel Use is 1,486 MMBtu/hr HHV   (Based on avg. heat rate)
 NOx /hr = 0.092 lbs/MMBtu * 1,486 MMBtu/hr
  = 136.7 lbs/hr. 

 Plant NOx = 136.7 lbs/hr * 4
      = 546.8 lbs/hr

 Run Hours = 498,000 lbs/hr / 546.8 lbs/hr
        = 911 hrs.
 These numbers are approximate and are conservative.

3. Regarding the performance issue with Wheatland Unit#3;    I did find a 
reference in the test report stating that units 3 & 4 were underfired due to 
the MW limiter in the WDPF.  Unit 3 was loaded at only 96.2% of base load and 
Unit 4 at 98.4%.  This along with Mitch's comments (The output guarantee was 
for the facility and each unit could have been fine tuned differently) more 
than likely contributed to the output differences.

4. The gas pressure issue at Wheatland in June was a one time excursion per 
Chris Norris.  There have been no pressure problems since then.

 Just wanted to give everyone a update on where we were with all the site 
visits to the plants.  As you already know, site visits begin this Thursday 
and runs through the 27th of October, so its a pretty tight schedule.  In 
terms of who will be specifically covering which plants, this is the 
following: Gleason will be Dave Kristich; Lincoln will be Fred Mitro; and 
Wheatland will be Ross Newlin.  These guys will cover the site visits the 
next two weeks, but everyone else may be asked to fill in for them if needed.
  While on the site visit, please make sure that the companies do not take 
any pictures and they are only allowed to talk to you or the plant manager.  
Most of the companies will probably be there for only a couple of hours per 
day.
 I hope all of this is clear and if you have any questions about scheduling 
please give me a call.  Again, thank you for your help with these issues.
Regards,

Ben

Ben:

Can you locate this document in the data room and forward to stuart zisman?  
I am in Chicago tomorrow and Friday and then Monday-Tuesday of next week.

Call me on my cell phone if we need to discuss (713-412-4612).  This document 
was in one of the last packages from Peoples Energy that went down to the 
data room.

Thanks,

Don, to be more specific....
1) Are the units started in parallel or sequence? (Could you please provide
a diagram of the ramp-up sequence to include timing)
2) How much start up power is required?
3) Is start up power purchased from Cinergy &/or IPL?  At what tariff rate?
4) How many Mwh are produced during start up? (May include as part of #1)
5) How much fuel is burned (MMBTU's) during start up?(May include as part of
#1)

Thanks for your help Don.

_______________________________________________________________

Thanks for the response.  According to my records, the outstanding
questions are as follows:

Wheatland

We understand that the Wheatland facility may seek a NPDES permit to
discharge wastewater directly to the White River.  How is this wastewater
currently managed?  Why is the facility considering changing the management
method to direct discharge under a NPDES permit?  If there are associated
cost savings with a NPDES permit, what are they estimated to be?  We
understand that the source of the water that is discharged is a pond
associated with mining operations.  Who is the owner of the pond?  Are any
water extraction permits needed to remove water from this pond and, if so,
have they been obtained?  We also understand that sampling was recently
performed of the water.  Please provide copies of this analysis and any
associated documentation.

Gleason

You indicated in the response to the Gleason questions that the variance
request for Subpart GG had been approved by TDEC and the approval would be
faxed to me.  To date, I have not received it.

LV Cogen

Earlier today, I asked a follow-up question on the coverage under the storm
water permit from 1998 to 2000.  I did not see an explanation of this gap
in the attached responses.


Given the approaching bid deadline, we would appreciate receiving this
information as soon as possible.

I ran a reconstruction macro on the 2000 peaker model.  There were some 
mysterious links to other files that made me nervous.  I managed to wipe 
these out and made the file about 25% smaller in the process.

Subject: Follow Up Items for DPL

Don,

The following are responses to items that I didn't have answers to during our 
meeting with DPL the other day.  I am not sure whether you would prefer to 
package them with your follow up items or send them independently.  Bracketed 
items require attention.


1)  Both the Remote Control Operation Agreement and the Interconnection 
Agreement with IPL were filed with the FERC.  [File stamped copies were sent 
to Hoff (and you) and should be incorporated into DealBench.];

2)  Regarding the question concerning document number 02.03.13 (Indiana 
Utility Regulatory Commission ("IURC") Petition and Approval) - According to 
our local counsel (Parvin Price at Bose McKinney), no approval or other 
authorization from the IURC is required in connection with a change in 
ownership.  If our transaction was structured as a disposition of assets, 
however, IURC consent would be required.  [He also mentioned that: (i) the 
new buyer should contact the IURC (if they were "smart") to notify them of 
the change in control following closing (this may have been his pitch for 
further business) and (ii) pursuant to the IURC Order dated 8/99 West Fork 
has certain on-going reporting requirements (he wondered whether we had 
delivered these reports - this is probably a Gus or Dave question).];

3)  Regarding any obligation or covenant of West Fork under the PILOT 
Agreement, I have exchanged voicemails with John Gregg (our local counsel in 
Indiana).  He briefly indicated that there is some "local expectation."  But 
said that he wanted to check into it further.  [I will provide an update 
Monday.]; and

4)  A question was raised with respect to the use of the easement from 
Carnanhan to West Fork dated 11/30/99  (Recorded in DR 271, P 688).  [Keenan 
will need to provide an answer on this one.]  I sent him an email requesting 
a response on this one.

These were the only outstanding DPL items that were on my list.  I would 
expect that Keenan, Kellermeyer and Eghneim will be able to provide answers 
to questions 4 and 2, respectively, no later than noon on Monday.  I will 
endeavour to meet the same time schedule on question 3.  Please feel free to 
call with any questions.

Stuart

to call you.  I was asked to get a draft out ASAP so I will call you today 
(Sunday) to discuss them.

I reviewed the attached questions.  Due to their technical nature, I should 
defer to Ross's judgement for the appropriate answers.

Ross:
Please cc me on the answers so that I can become more familiar with these 
issues.  I will be at the Lincoln plant by 8:00 tomorrow morning.

Thanks,

I reworked the debt section to eliminate tranche 1.  Tranche 2 now amortizes 
years 1-10 and pays 11% interest.  Tranche 3 amortizes years 11-20 with 
interest of 11.2%.  I re-solved for optimal amortization schedules and face 
amounts to get a minimum coverage ratio of 2.25x and an average coverage of 
3.25x.

I removed some references to the amortization of the power contract that 
Jinsung pointed out.  I also re-hardcoded the state franchise tax for Gleason.

Let me know what else needs re-working.

Subject: Question 2


More Questions:

Both Plants

1.  What are the short term NOx and CO emissions during startups, and are
there limitations during start-ups.

Start-up emissions vary and can not accurately be measured due to the 
inherent delay time in the CEMS system.  Additionally, start-up emissions are 
not required to be and in fact were not measured during the stack testing.  
There are no limitations on emissions during start-up evolutions, since the 
permits at both plants allow exceptions to exceedences during start-ups and 
shutdowns.

2.  Are industrial stormwater permits required at either site?


Caledonia

3.  In Caledonia, what is the custom fuel sampling schedule?


Brownsville

4.  What is the agency's response to the Enron letter regarding the 2nd
stormwater NOV?



5.  Has there been any further action by the agency since the 1st stormwater
NOV was never responded to?

6.  One memo stated that the stormwater is channeled to a wetland.  Was that
during construction only or is it ongoing?

7.  Were there any further problems with the B T Readymix concrete dumping
issue?

Thank you.
_______________________________________________________________

We appreciate your assistance in providing the responses to the
environmental questions regarding Gleason and the SPCC issue referenced on
the draft schedules.  The following questions are still outstanding,
however, from October 23 and October 25 despite your indication that the
responses to at least the October 23 questions would be available last
week.   Given the fast approaching bid deadline and the importance of the
responses to our due diligence review, we would appreciate receiving the
responses as quickly as possible.  For your convenience, the following is
the list of our outstanding questions:

Questions for All Facilities

1.  What are the limitations on the number of hours that each facility can
operate and what is the source of those limitations?

2.  We understand that there are tentative expansion plans for each
facility.  Were these future expansion plans disclosed to the regulating
agencies at the time that the air permits were applied for, particularly at
those facilities which did not undergo PSD review?

3.  Which facilities are required to perform continuous emissions
monitoring pursuant to its air permits?  For those facilities performing
CEM, please provide the last two years of data.

4.  Are the facilities FERC jurisdictional for environmental impact
statement purposes pursuant to 18 C.F.R. Part 380?  We noticed that the
only facility with information about this issue was the pipeline at
Lincoln, although the information seemed to suggest that only the pipeline
was subject to the EIS process.  See 2.02.12.G.  Was the rest of the
Lincoln facility subject to the EIS process?  What was the outcome of the
EIS process for the pipeline?

5.  What is Enron's understanding of the process required to transfer the
environmental permits for each facility in connection with the proposed
transaction?  For example, the 1995 stormwater permit for LV Cogen appears
to be triggered by a change in control of the facility.  See 6.02.03 at
page 16.  Do other permits have similar provisions?

6.  Will any environmental property transfer or comparable statutes (e.g.
the Illinois Responsible Property Transfer Act) be triggered by the
proposed transaction?

7. We have reviewed the United States Environmental Protection Agency
comments for the air permit at LV Cogen II, as discussed below.  Did U.S.
EPA provide any additional comments on the air permits for LV Cogen II or
any other facility?

Lincoln Facility

1.  Does the Lincoln facility have an air operating permit from the
Illinois Environmental Protection Agency?  If so, please provide a copy.
If not, please explain status.

2.  Were any wetlands impacted by the construction of the facility and, if
so, what permits were obtained?  Will any wetlands be impacted by future
expansion plans?  ENSR's conclusion on this issue seemed unclear,
particularly with respect to the 30 acre parcel.  See 02.03.09C.

Wheatland Facility

1.  We understand that the Wheatland facility may seek a NPDES permit to
discharge wastewater directly to the White River.  How is this wastewater
currently managed?  Why is the facility considering changing the management
method to direct discharge under a NPDES permit?  If there are associated
cost savings with a NPDES permit, what are they estimated to be?  We
understand that the source of the water that is discharged is a pond
associated with mining operations.  Who is the owner of the pond?  Are any
water extraction permits needed to remove water from this pond and, if so,
have they been obtained?  We also understand that sampling was recently
performed of the water.  Please provide copies of this analysis and any
associated documentation.

LV Cogen

1.  The Industrial User Discharge Permit on Dealbench appears to have
expired on July 1, 2000.  See 6.02.02.  Was it renewed?  If so, please
provide copy.

2.  The stormwater discharge permit for LV Cogen appears to be expired.
See 06.02.03.  Was it renewed?  If so, please provide copy.

3.  Does Sunco hold any environmental permits in its own name?  If so,
please provide copies.

LV Cogen II

1.  EPA contends in its March 23, 1998 and March 24, 2000 letters that BACT
for LV Cogen II was SCONOx and/or XONON.  See 06.01.09.1.   How was this
issue resolved?  Can LV Cogen II meet the 2 ppm NOx limit in the draft
operating permit with the technology that has been proposed?  See 06.01.15.

2.  It appears that the State of Nevada has contended that certain
equipment replacement should have undergone new source review in their June
13, 2000 memo.  See 16.03.6.    How was this resolved?  What is EPA's view
on this issue?

Schedules for LV Cogen I and II

1.  Schedule 4.1(i) references an annual audit of the CEM system in May
2000.  Is this audit on Dealbench and/or can we get a copy of it?

2.  Please provide a copy and/or reference to a Dealbench document for the
Phase I referenced on Schedule 4.1(n).

3.  Please provide copies and/or references to Dealbench documents for the
items listed as 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 on Schedule 4.1(u).  [Note that we have
reviewed the 1995 storm water permit, but did not see an indication that it
is automatically renewed.  Is this reflected elsewhere?]

Subject: Re:  

Mitch - I took out the first sentence from your answer to question #1. The 
CFR you wanted to refer to is part 60 and not part 75. In any case, I really 
do not think that the part 60 NSPS Subpart GG  limit of 98 ppm applies during 
startup and shut down. I believe that we are covered by the provisions of 
part 60 Subchapter A, Section 60.11(d) which calls only for good air 
pollution control practice to minimize emissions during startup and shutdown.

No short term emission limits apply during startup and shutdown. The only 
issue with startup and shut down emissions is that they get counted toward 
your total emissions for the year, and you certainly covered this issue in 
your last paragraph to question #1.

The revised file is attached.

Gus

Subject: Schedule Updates


Mitch,

There are a few items on which I need your input in order to update the
schedules for Brownsville and Caledonia.  Stuart has asked me to follow
up with you.

In re: Brownsville

I am still waiting on certain purchase orders from KVB Intertech and
Seimens (for telephone support), as well as any others that may be out
there.

"Mitchell/Ross, please have them faxed to my office number at 713-345-7384.  
Time has become more critical.  In order to save time, please also fax copies 
directly to Roger's office - - the fax number is below"

In re: Caledonia

I am also waiting on a purchase order from KVB Intertech, as well as any
others that may be out there.

"Pat/Ross, please fax to my office and directly to Roger"

Further, I am waiting on some spill info for Schedule 4.1(n),
Environmental Matters, of Caledonia.  Specifically, I need a blurb to
insert into the schedule.

"Already sent by Gus.  Let me know if you need anything else."

Also, on Schedule 7.12, Stuart stated that you are preparing some
updated to Excluded Assets for Caledonia.

"Pat, you stated in our conference call that there were some items that might 
have been at the plant that were of a personal nature and therefore would not 
be included in the asset sale.  In general, if they are low dollar (e.g. 
$500), then I don't believe you need to specifically exclude them.  This 
isn't meant to be a big deal; what I don't want to have happen is the buyer 
gets the plant and remembers a large drill press was at the plant and isn't 
anymore because it was your personal press.  Make sense??"


Finally, I am not clear on what to do on Schedule 4.1(v) on Caledonia in
regard to the defective blades as well as to some problem with the
(Westinghouse) bearings.  I need blurbs to insert into the Schedules.  I
have seen some documentation via e-mail, but do not know how these items
should be described in the Schedules.

"Had a discussion with a bidder this morning.  I recommend the following 
blurb.  Please review from a legal stand point and advise. - - - Though the 
generator bearings are operating correctly, the Brownsville turbine vendor 
has implemented an upgrade to these bearings at other plants.  Enron will 
make commercially reasonably efforts to get the vendor to conduct this 
upgrade as a warranty item. - - - The Caledonia turbine vendor has recently 
issued a Technical Information Letter (TIL) that could limit turbine 
operations during low ambient conditions.  Enron will make commercially 
reasonable efforts prior to deal closing to implement the control curve 
changes recommended in the TIL - - - Enron will continue to make commercially 
reasonable efforts to install new silencers on the exhaust of units 1 and 2 
at Brownsville in an attempt to mitigate possible start-up noise.  Enron will 
provide XXXXXXX copies of technical descriptions of the silencer improvements 
once received from the vendor.  If vendors provide possible solutions that 
substantially deviate from a silencer upgrade, Enron will get xxxxxxx's 
concurence prior to proceeding.  Enron will cover the cost of the silencer 
upgrade up to $500,000, and Enron will make commercially reasonable efforts 
to complete the upgrade prior to June 1, 2000.  If the upgrade completion is 
not likely to occur prior to June 1, 2000, Enron will get xxxxxx's 
concurrence prior to proceeding."


Please update me at your earliest possible convenience as we are still
in negotiations with the counterparty and may be executing this
agreement this weekend.

Please call me with any questions.

Thanks.

Per our conversation on 10/13, I would like to confirm the following site
visit dates for the Enron peaker assets:

Gleason - 10/23
Wheatland - 10/24
Lincoln - 10/26

Thanks for your help.

Response - There is not enough info. in item four for me to fully answer. I 
also need to know what the content of document 2.02.12.G.   However, I'll 
give it my best shot:

 The interconnect facilities upstream of the intersection of the lateral and 
N. Border's Manhattan Station are subject to FERC jurisdiction.  N. Border 
completed the hot tap and interconnect facilities under its blanket 
authorization.  I do not know what they mean by "the rest of the Lincoln 
facility".  As for the question relating to the "outcome of the EIS process 
for the pipeline", do they mean the lateral or the interconnect facility?

Subject: Lincoln - EIS issue

Chris/Dave:

Please take a look at question 4 in the attached file.  It deals with the 
issue of whether the 2000 Peaker Facilities or associated gas laterals are 
FERC jurisdictional facilities and/or require an EIS statement.  My initial 
recollection is that such an EIS was not required for either the Lincoln 
plant or the attached gas pipeline.

Let me know your thoughts with a cc to Ben Rogers.

Thanks,
Fred

Don,

The following questions/requests came out of our visit yesterday:

1.  Provide forecast for the overhaul budget.
2.  Provide forced outage (trips) reports since inception which should
include details of hours out, reasons, etc.  From the limited info we have,
we are surprised by the higher than expected trips, at least at one of the
units.  Any proposed solutions?
3.  What is the latest info on complaints on noise from neighbors?  New
petitions; responses; etc.
4.  What were the hours of operation in 1999 and 2000?  There were some
conflicts in the various info provided.
5.  Was PSD every applied for?
6.  Unit #4 seems to be running right at the 25 ppm for NOx.  If it does go
over 25 ppm, does it violate any regulations, permits, promises, etc.?
7.  The actual O&M numbers are higher than budget (almost twice the budgeted
number).  What cause this?
8.  High bearing temperatures have cause trips.  We understand that Enron
recommended this to be considered a Warranty Item.  Was it ever resolved
under warranty.
9.  Why was utilization much higher with unit 1?

Thanks.

David

Here's our local counsel's response on the Duke question relating any 
contractual obligations (in Indiana) to retain a certain minimum number of 
employees.  His answer relates specifically to the tax abatement that we 
received.  In his memo, he suggests that we speak with John Gregg (which as 
you both know I have already done).  He mentioned that going below nine 
employees would likely ruffle some political feathers.  If I am not mistaken, 
however, I believe that we have more than nine people and therefore there 
might be some economies that are achievable by a potential buyer.

I would add only one thing to the response from Gus.

In regards to #2, neither plant meets the definition of "industrial activity" 
under 40 CFR 122.  As a result, neither plant needs an industrial stormwater 
permit.  Both plants were required to obtain construction stormwater permits.

Subject: 

Answers to your Questions:

Both Plants

1.  What are the short term NOx and CO emissions during startups, and are
there limitations during start-ups.

See answers provided by Mitch and Pat. In addition, I offer the following:

Caledonia - There is no specific exemption in the permit for startup and 
shutdown. We tried to request one when we modified the permit for peak firing 
in May. The state told us however, that there is no need to provide a 
specific exemption in the permit and that we can rely on the exemption 
provided in the general rules under (APC-S-1, Section 10.2)

Brownsville - Again, there is no specific exemption for startup and shutdown. 
We are relying on the exemption provided in the general rules under 
regulation 1200-3-20-0.02 which calls for implementation of good management 
practice to minimize emissions during startup and shutdown.

2.  Are industrial stormwater permits required at either site?

No. There is no wastewater discharge at either site

Caledonia

3.  In Caledonia, what is the custom fuel sampling schedule?

We are implementing the recommended EPA protocol for natural gas sampling 
which calls for twice per month the first six months, then once per quarter 
the first six quarters, then semi-annually thereafter. However, since we are 
also required under Part 75 to analyze for the natural gas heat content on a 
monthly basis, I have asked the plant managers to analyze for the sulfur 
content monthly. 

Brownsville

4.  What is the agency's response to the Enron letter regarding the 2nd
stormwater NOV?

We have not received any written correspondence from the agency following the 
second NOV. However, the site was inspected after completion of the 
corrective measures (around June 15) and the state inspector was satisfied 
with the progress made to bring the site into compliance with the stormwater 
construction permit.

5.  Has there been any further action by the agency since the 1st stormwater
NOV was never responded to?

I am not aware of any action

6.  One memo stated that the stormwater is channeled to a wetland.  Was that
during construction only or is it ongoing?

I am not aware of anything existing. I believe that this is during 
construction.
Mitchell -- any thoughts on that?

7.  Were there any further problems with the B T Readymix concrete dumping
issue?

Mitchell - Please respond to this question

Juan tells me that everything will be moved tomorrow sometime.  We want the 
cabinets to be locked for the move, so I'll lock them up tonight when I 
leave.  If you need to get in the files, grab the keys from my top drawer.  
Make sure to lock things up and replace the keys when you're done.  I'll 
unlock the stuff when it gets settled across the street tomorrow.

Ben, 
Attached is the latest draft of the Beck report. I'm attaching a list that I 
prepared that generally has the items that are outstanding; however, the 
priority items are the back up information on performance testing (& curves) 
of the inlet fogging system and the peaking testing (output) of the three 
units and the confirmation of the data in table 5 (long term performance of 
the projects).
I have the O&M contracts, the monthly reports, and the contracts between OEC 
and Caldwell for the inlet fogging system, but these do not contain what 
Conrad (RW Beck) is looking for. My understanding from the operations guys is 
that there is data for the above items.
As discussed, Conrad will be here Monday morning, so if we could have the 
back up information for these items by then, it would expedite the process 
tremendously.
You can reach me at 54426 if you have any questions.
Thanks for your help.
Joana

I received a call from Tom Favinger at PG&E today.  He is looking for the
responses to his questions from last week and also has a new question.  He
would like to get a breakout of the $10.25 million item in the Pastoria
capital budget labeled Pre-Commercial Operations Costs.

I also spoke to Darryn O Llegas from PECO today.  They are planning to bid
on the peakers and LV Cogen on Friday.  His questions are:

Peakers

* Will Enron's control area dispatching/scheduling software be
included in the property conveyed with the peakers?
* Do the Peaker's permits make any allowance for combined cycle
operation or would they need to re-start the permitting process?
* They would like clarification concerning the joint ownership of gas
interconnects - what is owned, cost to maintain, etc.

LV Cogen

* Update on status of Phase II permitting?
* Update on status of development process?
* Are there any tax abatements of any type for the Phase II project?

Additional Comments from PECO:

* Don't have price curves yet for all of the peakers markets - will
need to develop prior to final bid.
* May have a concern re: market power for the peakers as a result of
the PECO/Unicom merger.  They will be comfortable enough to bid this week
and don't expect it to be a concern for the final bid.
* They will probably submit a bid with separate values for: Wheatland;
other peakers together; LV Cogen.
* They are working their bid from two perspectives: replacement cost
plus a premium and discounted cash flow.  DCF will obviously change as they
get their price curves updated.

Tuesday, the 21st,  at 1:00 pm we will have a meeting in 2988 for 
approximately one hour to discuss the schedules to the Purchase and Sale 
Agreements for the 1999 Peakers.  We will have copies of the schedules 
available for your review.  We need everyone's participation, particularly if 
you have any knowledge of the 1999 assets, and any contractual arrangements 
that may exist with the assets. We will be making reps and warranties as to 
the completeness of the schedules.  We can't afford to over look anything.  
If by chance we have excluded someone from the list of attendees that should 
be at the meeting, please forward this email to them.

We also have a call-in number for those outside the office 1-877-331-6867, 
code: 965303.

I apologize for planning this during what is typically a down week, however, 
we are on a tight timeline with the 1999s.

FYI: The potential sale of the 1999s has not been broadly distributed.  We 
are trying to limit this information to a fairly tight group.  Please keep 
this to yourself. 

Please email me back if you will not be attending.

Thanks,

Quick comments.  Mike, what are your thoughts on my answer in O5?

I'll provide start numbers for O5 later today.

E2.  No; however, CFR60 subpart GG short term limits still apply 
(approximately 90 ppm NOx) which are well above the turbine emissions.

T1.  "on any asset" should read "of any asset"

O5. Since commercial operations, the Wheatland facility has averaged xx 
starts per machine, and the Lincoln facility has averaged yy starts per 
machine.  The start-up and commissioning process followed a normal startup 
progression.  The Lincoln facility experienced a generator failure in unit #7 
during the first run season.  General Electric replaced the generator under 
warranty provisions.  Sratification of gas flows was observed in the stacks 
at the Wheatland facility during CEMS certification.  The CEMS certification 
was then postponed until Summer '01.

O6.  Wasn't it a strip mine?  I didn't think it was a coal mine.

Mitch

Don,

Tom and I had a quite good meeting with ICF staff yesterday. Although they 
did not show us actual mathematical formula, Tom is a lot more comfortable 
with ICF methodology. Their definition of capacity price and energy price is 
a little different from traditional concept. Tom will write summary memo and 
we can sit down Wednesday morning (9 or 10am). Another outcome is that we can 
go over ICF's assumption about O&M, financing, etc, and request more 
information as it is needed.

Are you available 9 or 10 am tomorrow? Thanks.

Jinsung

One minor follow-up question: the stormwater permit for LV Cogen at
Dealbench expired on May 14, 1998 (see 6.2.3).  The Notice of Intent to
continue coverage is dated May 4, 2000 (see 6.2.3.1).  Was there coverage
under a stormwater permit between 1998 and 2000?  Thanks.

I know the following goes without saying, but I wanted to highlight a few 
specific points relevant to this transaction.

As all of you know, the sale of Brownsville and Caledonia to Cinergy was 
recently announced.  As the press release indicated, the terms of the 
transaction were not released.  While Allegheny (with the sale of the 2000s) 
took the same position in its announcement, the purchase price was 
subsequently released to the market (by Allegheny).  Cinergy and Enron both 
agreed in the Purchase and Sale Agreement, to not release the price and terms 
without the other's consent (i.e. THE PRICE AND TERMS WILL REMAIN 
CONFIDENTIAL). 

To the extent legally permitted, Cinergy will not release the price as part 
of its regulatory filings, and in fact, will redact the price from all of its 
filings.  If, through your involvement in this process, you inadvertently 
learned the price, you must keep it to yourself.  As we all know, information 
moves around this organization very quickly.  With two deals on very similar 
assets in the market at once (Allegheny and Cinergy), it only makes sense to 
contain the external flow of information.

By the way, both transactions should close March/April 2001.

Thanks for your help in this process, and your co-operation in keeping this 
information confidential.

Regards,

Don

This week I will be arranging site visits for the bidders of Pastoria and LV 
Cogen I and II.  There will be nine bidders for each but not all are the 
same.  Before the first visit, I want to remind you of the confidential 
nature of the process and send you the Site Visit Procedures.

Confidentiality

All aspects of the bidding process are to be kept confidential.  This means 
that you must not disclose to another bidder or any other person:

the name of any bidder, or
any questions asked, or comments made, by any bidder 

If you have any questions regarding a confidentiality issue, contact me and 
Karen Jones or Dale Rasmussen. 

Site Visit Procedures

The attached Site Visit Procedures were distributed to the Phase II bidders 
last week.  Please read them carefully and follow them.  Should you have any 
questions, please call me.

Our internal site visit procedures will be as follows.   As I receive site 
visit requests, I will notify the applicable Site Visit Coordinator - Bill 
WIlliams for LVI and LVII and Sam and Dean for Pastoria - to set the time.

I will receive from each bidder, and will forward to the Site VIsit 
Coordinators, a list of attendees (with a contact number for the bidder's 
site visit coordinator) and the hotel and travel information, as applicable.

Please call me should you have any questions.  Thanks.

_______________________________________________________________

Tom Irwin asked that we contact you each of you directly on behalf of
Allegheny to ask the following environmental due diligence questions that
we have not resolved based on our review of the Dealbench documents.
Please, however, feel free to reference specific documents on Dealbench if
you believe they would be useful.

Questions for All Facilities

1.  What are the limitations on the number of hours that each facility can
operate and what is the source of those limitations?

2.  We understand that there are tentative expansion plans for each
facility.  Were these future expansion plans disclosed to the regulating
agencies at the time that the air permits were applied for, particularly at
those facilities which did not undergo PSD review?

3.  Which facilities are required to perform continuous emissions
monitoring pursuant to its air permits?  For those facilities performing
CEM, please provide the last two years of data.

4.  Are the facilities FERC jurisdictional for environmental impact
statement purposes pursuant to 18 C.F.R. Part 380?  We noticed that the
only facility with information about this issue was the pipeline at
Lincoln, although the information seemed to suggest that only the pipeline
was subject to the EIS process.  See 2.02.12.G.  Was the rest of the
Lincoln facility subject to the EIS process?  What was the outcome of the
EIS process for the pipeline?

5.  What is Enron's understanding of the process required to transfer the
environmental permits for each facility in connection with the proposed
transaction?  For example, the 1995 stormwater permit for LV Cogen appears
to be triggered by a change in control of the facility.  See 6.02.03 at
page 16.  Do other permits have similar provisions?

6.  Will any environmental property transfer or comparable statutes (e.g.
the Illinois Responsible Property Transfer Act) be triggered by the
proposed transaction?

7. We have reviewed the United States Environmental Protection Agency
comments for the air permit at LV Cogen II, as discussed below.  Did U.S.
EPA provide any additional comments on the air permits for LV Cogen II or
any other facility?

Lincoln Facility

1.  Does the Lincoln facility have an air operating permit from the
Illinois Environmental Protection Agency?  If so, please provide a copy.
If not, please explain status.

2.  Were any wetlands impacted by the construction of the facility and, if
so, what permits were obtained?  Will any wetlands be impacted by future
expansion plans?  ENSR's conclusion on this issue seemed unclear,
particularly with respect to the 30 acre parcel.  See 02.03.09C.

Gleason Facility

1.  Does the Gleason facility have an air operating permit from the
Tennessee Department of Environment & Conservation?  If so, please provide
a copy.  If not, please explain status.  We also noticed that the
construction permit expired on October 1, 2000.  See 02.01.02.  Was it
renewed?

2.  What is the status of the petition for variance to the Tennessee
Department of Environment & Conservation for alternative testing and
monitoring methods under NSPS Subpart GG dated April 17, 2000?  See
02.01.04B.  What is the status of the letter requesting a waiver of certain
source emission tests dated April 18, 2000?  See 02.01.04A.

3.  Is there enough water to support an expansion of the facility at
Gleason?  Please provide any testing/analysis that has been performed with
respect to this issue.

Wheatland Facility

1.  We understand that the Wheatland facility may seek a NPDES permit to
discharge wastewater directly to the White River.  How is this wastewater
currently managed?  Why is the facility considering changing the management
method to direct discharge under a NPDES permit?  If there are associated
cost savings with a NPDES permit, what are they estimated to be?  We
understand that the source of the water that is discharged is a pond
associated with mining operations.  Who is the owner of the pond?  Are any
water extraction permits needed to remove water from this pond and, if so,
have they been obtained?  We also understand that sampling was recently
performed of the water.  Please provide copies of this analysis and any
associated documentation.

LV Cogen

1.  The Industrial User Discharge Permit on Dealbench appears to have
expired on July 1, 2000.  See 6.02.02.  Was it renewed?  If so, please
provide copy.

2.  The stormwater discharge permit for LV Cogen appears to be expired.
See 06.02.03.  Was it renewed?  If so, please provide copy.

3.  Does Sunco hold any environmental permits in its own name?  If so,
please provide copies.

LV Cogen II

1.  EPA contends in its March 23, 1998 and March 24, 2000 letters that BACT
for LV Cogen II was SCONOx and/or XONON.  See 06.01.09.1.   How was this
issue resolved?  Can LV Cogen II meet the 2 ppm NOx limit in the draft
operating permit with the technology that has been proposed?  See 06.01.15.

2.  It appears that the State of Nevada has contended that certain
equipment replacement should have undergone new source review in their June
13, 2000 memo.  See 16.03.6.    How was this resolved?  What is EPA's view
on this issue?

David Parquet asked me to forward these answers to you:
Question:
Is the major maintenance reserve estimate based on a negotiated Long Term
Services Agreement (LTSA)?  If so, will it be in place and transfer with
PEF?
Answer:  We have not negotiated an LTSA with anyone at this time, and we do 
not expect to have one in place to transfer with PEF.  The maintenance 
reserve is our estimate based on industry data and information from GE.

Question: Are spare parts for the first major overhaul included anywhere in 
the
capital cost estimate or are they assumed to be purchased through the
maintenance reserve estimate (i.e. the LTSA) charge?

Answer:  The maintenance reserve is intended to include parts and labor for 
the overhaul.

Subject: Questions regarding PSD permit for Lincoln


Don,

As a result of our review of the information and documents on Lincoln we
are requesting additional documents which are not in the data room.

1.   Relating to the plant's PSD:

     The Mostardi & Platt emissions test protocol for the May 2000
     emissions test
      A report to Illlinois EPA containing the emission test data
     Continuous Emission Monitoring (" CEM") Data ( all data
     developed since start-up)
     Any reports to IEPA required under the permit pertaining to
     exceedances, or
     start-up, breakdown & malfunction ( we have internal memos indicating
     that there
     was a breakdown at # 7 on July 5,2000)

2. Also, we don't have any permits for wastewater discharge. We have been
told that there is no wastewater discharged except
sewage/office wastewater which is going to a septic field. But we have no
verification of this at this point.

Thank you for your attention to these items.

I agree that this should be included in the due diligence files but only 
after the confidentiality issue is resolved.  The portion of the contract 
dealing with confidentiality states that information designated as 
"confidential" must be safeguarded.  It is unclear whether the agreement 
itself constitutes "confidential" information and therefore I would suggest 
that the counterparty be contacted in order to obtain permission to disclose 
the draft agreement.  I am nearly certain that they will not have any problem 
as they are likely to want the business from the purchaser of the facility.

Subject: Excelon questions - Lincoln

Don:

The questions that I was unable to answer for Excelon (PECO) during the 
Lincoln site visit are as follows:

1.  What is the gas consumption per unit during start-up?

2.  What is the reference # for the 2nd ComEd Interconnection Feasibility 
Study?  Is this document on deal bench?

3.  Do any other parties have a right to interconnect to the Project's gas 
pipeline lateral?


My input to these questions is:

1.  None.  I am not familiar with this area.

2.  I saw this 2nd study is out on deal bench at least a week ago.  As long 
as it wasn't removed, it should be there.   I do not know the reference #.

3.  I do not believe that any other parties have a right to connect to the 
gas lateral owned by Des Plaines LLC.  (In fact,  I believe that we are 
statutorily prevented from supplying gas to other end users - Des Plaines LLC 
is neither an interstate pipeline nor a gas LDC).  Please confirm my opinion 
with Stuart/Chris Meyer to make sure that we have not granted any 
interconnection rights to Northern Border/Peoples.

Call me to discuss.

Fred

Ben - did I correctly read the last transitional heading "Deal Maker".  
Further, did I correctly not see my name listed in BOLD next to this item.  
For shame.  For your info, PRC is over.....you can stop kissing Don's butt.

Don, a couple of questions.

1) Are the warranties assignable? Any "change of control" issues?

2) Can I get a copy of the completed real estate purchase contracts and
details on pending real estate deals


Also, I have attached an "Outlook" business card for your reference.

Thanks

John

I spoke with Gavin Gaul just now about the GA drawings for the 99 peakers.  
He said that he would have to do some poking around, because those drawings 
would have been archived a year ago.  But he thought he could get me the 
as-built site layout drawings for the plants.  The version of the Brownsville 
layout from the CD-ROM is not as-built, so maybe we should hold off on the 
layouts until we get the as-builts from Gavin.  I'll let you know as soon as 
I hear back from him.

Don - I will not be able to attend the meeting tomorrow at 1:30 PM because of 
a Dr.'s appointment. Between Dave and Chris, and all the written answers we 
provided, you should be covered on environmental. I will be glad to help out 
with any additional questions they may have.

Ben - The answer to the question you left me on voice mail is no. I have not 
yet received a written response from EPA approving the CEMS certification 
extension deadline until January 30, 2001. I was verbally told that our 
request was approved in a policy review committee held on October 12, 2000. 
DPL can verify this approval by calling my EPA Clean Air Markets Division 
Contact, Louis Nichols at (202) 564-0161.

Thanks.

The following is an update, including several additions to DealBench.

1.  The Purchase and Sale Agreement ("PSA") for each asset has now been 
posted to DealBench under the New Document section.  Please review the 
instructions attached to each PSA.

2. The Management Presentations (with audio) have now been posted to 
DealBench under the Management Presentations section.  When attempting to 
view the presentation, please log onto DealBench using Microsoft Explorer. 
Once in DealBench, you will most likely need to download "Flash Player" (free 
download).  You can do this by clicking "Macromedia Flash Player download 
center in the Linked Documents section of DealBench.  The download usually 
takes less than 30 seconds.  After the download, return to the Management 
Presentation section of DealBench and click on the Management Presentation 
(with audio).   A power point presentation has also been included in the 
Management Presentation section of DealBench.   A detailed instruction guide 
"Instruction for Viewing Management Presentation" has been posted in New 
Document section of DealBench.

3.  Please be sure to consistently review the New Documents section on 
DealBench for any new documents that have been added to DealBench.  Also, a 
running black line Due Diligence Index is posted in the Due Diligence Index / 
Plant Pictures section of DealBench.

4. Any drawings or CDs that you need from the Due Diligence Indices may be 
requested by sending an email to don.miller@enron.com or jhoff2@enron.com.

5.  Any problems or issues that you may be encountering may be directed to 
Jinsung Myung at 713-853-7330.

6.  We are prepared to schedule Q&A sessions.  Please contact Don Miller at

Mitch,

This afternoon we have forwarded to your fax machine copies of the requested 
operational data as well as the CEMs Monitoring Plan.  Regarding the 
Monitoring Plan, Ron sent you via email the updates to that plan necessitated 
by the EDR version 2.1 upgrade.  Included in that email are the 6 upgrade 
attachments - one for each unit.

As I send you this note the CEMs Quality Assurance Plan is being scanned and 
sent via fax machine.

Therefore, I believe I have provided all the info indicated on Gus's reply 
below.

Regards,
-Pat

All,

This morning I provided the following info and documents.  I will correspond 
with all of you but am sending the documents to Mitch Robinson's fax machine 
unless requested to do otherwise by Mitch.

1.  I fax'd to Mitch and Stuart Zisman the results of the "Personal Property" 
inventory.
2.  I fax'd Mitch the most recent water bill.  To the best of my knowledge 
there is no contract with the Town of Caledonia for water.  We utilize an 
industrial user account.  The account number (14670) is on the bill. 
3.  I fax'd Mitch the Emergency Action Plan.  This plan is under revision.  I 
sent the existing plan as well as the portion of the plan where revisions are 
complete.
4.  I also sent the Semi-Annual Excess Emissions Report.

After lunch I will send the CEMs QA/QC documents and CEMs data which has been 
requested.

Site personnel, under my direction conducted a spot check of spare parts 
utilizing the most recent inventory list provided by Jim Meyer.  I certify 
that the spare parts inventory, based upon this spot check, is substantially 
complete including the high-dollar components.

Regards,

Andy Johnson (Mgr Business Development)with El Paso is double/triple checking 
the max flow rate,
but it  is believed to be 190,000 mmbtu/day or 7,900 mmbtu/hr.
Currently at 500 Mw and 11.5 heat rate, our  flow rate is approx 5,750 
mmbtu/hr

I have calls into El Paso again today...Also John Hodge (from Stephanie 
Miller's group) has 
replaced the calls he made on Friday, at my request.  The only reference any 
documents that I have make is to the
current max flow rate of the plant.  However I am sure the interconnect was 
built larger than required.
I will for ward the respones ASAP.

Richard,
Pat just informed me that you need numbers for starts and hours on Unit 3. 
Unit 3 had MarkV problems in the past that needed to be corrected by shutting 
down the system.  This erased any historical information that the machine had 
stored.  Unit 4 and 3 were started up within one or two days apart. There 
should be minimal difference between the two of them. We ran units 3&4 as 
brother and sister during the first year of operation, so I would feel very 
confident with the following numbers.
Fired Hours- 738
Fired Starts- 105
Emergency Stops- 5
Peak Fired Hours-8
Total Starts- 123
If you need further assistance please let me know. Ron D.

Ben,

Per my voice mail, I am with PECO Energy and am the PECO team lead on the
Enron opportunity.  CSFB (Lou Iaconetti) has informed us that PECO has been
selected to proceed into Round II of the bidding process on the Lincoln,
Gleason and Wheatland peaking units.  I would appreciate it if you could
let me know what dates are available for site visits.

Thanks for your help.

Sections:

 2.11 last question: Yes plant can operate without a gas nomination in place 
for that day. As mentioned
     a gas nomination and a notice of flow to Gas Control are both requested 
by Midwestern
     but not required.

 2.12   Interruptible transport maximum under current contract is 125,000/day.
     First 85,000/day is at discounted rate.
     Physical capacity of interconnect is 190,000/day.

 2.15   As mentioned above the maximum physical capacity of the interconnect 
between the plant and
     Midwestern is 190,000 mmbtu/day or about 7900/hour.  Our current 
transportation contract 
     maximum is 125,000/day (first 85,000/day discounted) because with 
current plant size the
     maximum hourly flow rate is 5500/hour.  Additional Interruptible 
transport from Pipeline
     could easily be granted. 

 2.16   All daily imbalances hit the OBA (Operational Balancing Agreement) at 
the plant site.  There is
     no charge for the OBA, or for the daily imbalances.  Imbalances are 
cumulative for the month
     and are cashed-out at each month end in accordance to Midwestern tariff 
provisions.
      Per Midwestern, holder of OBA is asked to minimize  size of imbalance 
in accordance
      to integrity off Midwestern's system.  If a daily imbalance, or  
cumulative imbalance
     begins to threaten integrity of system, Midwestern can call and ask you 
to reduce imbalance.
     After that warning the pipe can issue a point specific OFO, which could 
lead to penalties
     for failure to minimize any imbalances. 
     Since inception of plant 5/00 -  we have never encountered any balancing 
problems/penalties.

Based on the plant design (not measured values), the Full Load Parasitic
would be about 4,600 kW, the "Stand-By" Parasitic load would be about 385 kW
(power backfed through GSU Transformers). If the plant is held in "Stand-By"
without the GSU's energized, then the parasitic drops to about 85 kW.

Mike Connelly is expected back in Bothell tomorrow. He should be checking
his e-mail so you might want to sent him a message (if you haven't done so
already).

_______________________________________________________________

The following questions were raised by our review of the draft
environmental schedules on Dealbench.

LV Cogen I and II

1.  Schedule 4.1(i) references an annual audit of the CEM system in May
2000.  Is this audit on Dealbench and/or can we get a copy of it?

2.  Please provide a copy and/or reference to a Dealbench document for the
Phase I referenced on Schedule 4.1(n).

3.  Please provide copies and/or references to Dealbench documents for the
items listed as 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 on Schedule 4.1(u).  [Note that we have
reviewed the 1995 storm water permit, but did not see an indication that it
is automatically renewed.  Is this reflected elsewhere?]

Wheatland, Gleason and Lincoln

1.  We noticed that Schedule 4.1(u) for each facility indicates that an
SPCC is needed but not currently in place.  What is stored that triggers
the SPCC requirement?  How long have these materials been stored at the
facilities?

Please feel free to call me if you have any questions or if you would like
to discuss these issues in further detail.  Thanks.

Ben,
Attached is a revised Confidentiality Agreement which incorporates many of
your suggested changes.  Several additional changes are being made to
address issues associated with the inadvertent erosion of key provisions
benefiting both Enron and Cinergy that resulted from other changes in your
latest drafts.  I assure you that this document with your changes
incorporated is less than what Cinergy has been willing to agree to in the
past.  I look forward to a favorable response so the pressing need for
exchange of documents and further business discussions can proceed
expeditiously.

I recommend putting the attached e-mails and attachments in the DD room.  
We've also had verbal discussions with the IEPA to verify that the retest can 
be postponed.  It can.

Michelle -

Please forward to Mike Murphy.  In general, the schedule is acceptable.
Please work with Merle on the details.  Can you or Mike confirm my
understanding of the following?

1.  Though the units ran within limits on NOx and CO throughout the summer,
GE believes that the performance will be enhanced with the attached
modifications (i.e. NOx will be reduced even further to the 7.5-8.5 ppm
range).

Response:  The GE target will be to have NOx at 7.5-8.5 range. In addition
the expectation is that CO will also be around 10ppm at Base load
conditions.

2.  The liners will have their dilution holes resized.  Will the secondary
nozzles also be modified, or is this not required?

Response:  The secondary nozzles will be modified to meet the new group
number change which will increase the effective area. This is an engineering
requirement. In addition the primary nozzle effective are will change with
the new part numbers. The liner dilution hole change will be standard across
all the units.

3.  You can postpone the retest until the next expected run season
(December/January).

Response:  The retest could be delayed until the winter peak season but in
the event that a unit was run after modification without a test, the risk of
compliance would be to Enron. GE feels very strongly that a reliable
operation of the unit would include retest as soon as practical after
modifications.  In the event the units will not run until 2Q 2001, the
abiity of GE to respond to the site need may be in jeopardy due to the high
number of new unit start ups.

4.  This change will not limit the ability to run prior to the scheduled
test, in the event of an unexpected run call.

Response:  The units would be available to run, but the operator may not
know where the unit would be in a regards to compliance.  We are also trying
to bring the unit back to a nominal firing temperature. The other point to
consider is whether or not you need to alert the EPA of the modification and
what your requirements are with that entity.

5.  Enron or Des Plaines Green Land Development (Lincoln Center) will not
incur any financial obligations as a result of the change-out.

Response:  GE will be paying for all labor, tools and shop work necessary to
perform the modifications, but Enron or Des Plaines Green Land Development
would be responsible for all fuel costs, electrical costs and operator
costs.

Thanks for your diligence, and please let the GE team know that I
appreciate the effort given to the Lincoln plant.  Regarding both the
generator change-out and the emissions effort, I have no complaints with
GE's performance.

Regards,

Mitch

Mitch,

Attached is the handout presentation that was given today to the Enron
team.
I have also attached the proposed schedule for the work at the Lincoln
Center site. The plan is work two (2) shifts per day, ten (10) per day. It
is expected to take six (6) days per unit at this time. GE will work to
minimize the schedule and we hope with productivity and best practices to
improve the schedule. After the hardware changes made, retesting of the
units will need to occur. GE will bring and emissions test vendor to the
<<Wilton Customerhandout.ppt>>  <<Emissions schedule.xls>>  site and check
the NOx and CO readings. It is expected that the units will need to run at
Base Load for Approximately 8-10 hours and then at the reduced loads to
check part readings. The total operating time should be about 12 twelve
hours.

If you have any questions, please contact Michelle April or myself.

Michelle -

Please forward to Mike Murphy.  In general, the schedule is acceptable.  
Please work with Merle on the details.  Can you or Mike confirm my 
understanding of the following?

1.  Though the units ran within limits on NOx and CO throughout the summer, 
GE believes that the performance will be enhanced with the attached 
modifications (i.e. NOx will be reduced even further to the 7.5-8.5 ppm 
range).

2.  The liners will have their dilution holes resized.  Will the secondary 
nozzles also be modified, or is this not required?

3.  You can postpone the retest until the next expected run season 
(December/January).

4.  This change will not limit the ability to run prior to the scheduled 
test, in the event of an unexpected run call.

5.  Enron or Des Plaines Green Land Development (Lincoln Center) will not 
incur any financial obligations as a result of the change-out.

Thanks for your diligence, and please let the GE team know that I appreciate 
the effort given to the Lincoln plant.  Regarding both the generator 
change-out and the emissions effort, I have no complaints with GE's 
performance.

Regards,

Mitch

Mitch,

Mike Murphy tried to email this to you but was unsucessful.  I also spoke
with Ross Newlin concerning the testing.  We need to speak with you to
confirm one way or another.

Mitch,

Attached is the handout presentation that was given today to the Enron team.
I have also attached the proposed schedule for the work at the Lincoln
Center site. The plan is work two (2) shifts per day, ten (10) per day. It
is expected to take six (6) days per unit at this time. GE will work to
minimize the schedule and we hope with productivity and best practices to
improve the schedule. After the hardware changes made, retesting of the
units will need to occur. GE will bring and emissions test vendor to the
<<Wilton Customerhandout.ppt>>  <<Emissions schedule.xls>>  site and check
the NOx and CO readings. It is expected that the units will need to run at
Base Load for Approximately 8-10 hours and then at the reduced loads to

Subject: Questions regarding PSD permit for Lincoln


Don,

As a result of our review of the information and documents on Lincoln we
are requesting additional documents which are not in the data room.

1.   Relating to the plant's PSD:

     The Mostardi & Platt emissions test protocol for the May 2000
     emissions test
      A report to Illlinois EPA containing the emission test data
     Continuous Emission Monitoring (" CEM") Data ( all data
     developed since start-up)
     Any reports to IEPA required under the permit pertaining to
     exceedances, or
     start-up, breakdown & malfunction ( we have internal memos indicating
     that there
     was a breakdown at # 7 on July 5,2000)

2. Also, we don't have any permits for wastewater discharge. We have been
told that there is no wastewater discharged except
sewage/office wastewater which is going to a septic field. But we have no
verification of this at this point.

Thank you for your attention to these items.
