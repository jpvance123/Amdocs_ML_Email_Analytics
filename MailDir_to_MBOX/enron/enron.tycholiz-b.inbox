Hey there Barry! Just wanted to drop you an note to say thanks for the
cocktails and laughs the other night in Denver. We had a great time with
you guys.

I will store your card and give you a call or drop you a note before we
come to Houston next season. Maybe you can round up some Houston buddies
that could entertain us as much as your Denver ones!

We are off to San Antonio this week with the Lakers. It is a fun town. I am
sure we will manage to find some kind of trouble to get into. Do you ever
go there? Any good restaurant recomendations? There are so many to choose
from.

Talk with you later,

Debra

Barry,

I have spoken to my insurance agent.  Please take the car in for an estimate
and let me know what they say.  After that I can work with the insurance
company to get them to do the rest of the coordination.

Thank you.  I am sorry for the inconvenience and for the whole incident.

Barry,

My name is Alisha Mahabir and I have been working on negotiating the MGI/ENA GISB.  I have been in contact with Lourdes Cervantes at MGI; her phone number is 525-232-5990.  There are still a few issues left to be resolved before we can proceed with the execution of this document.  Per Geral Nemec's request, I will outline these changes as they are addressed in Exhibit B to the GISB that was sent over by Lourdes.

Initially I want to note that some changes must be made to the front page of the GISB.  MGI has previously agreed to allow ENA to be the confirming party under Section 2.5.  Additionally, there have been a few problems with allowing payment to be made on the 30th day of the month.  It appears that MGI has been construing this provision broadly so as to make payment on the 2nd day of March after a short month in February.  Thus, we would like Section 7.2 to read "30th day or, for the Month of February, on the last day of the Month".  

As for Exhibit B, the changes are as follows:

#4 The words "or interruptible" should be deleted from this provision.  The interruptible language conflicts with the ability to do 30 day firm deals under this contract.

#11 This provision deals with when notices are deemed received.  The provision as written provides that notice by first class mail is deemed received 2 business days after mailing.  MGI would like to change this to allow for receipt to mean actual receipt.  Lourdes told me that she will check to see whether the change can be stricken or at least to extend 2 business days to 3 business days.

#12 (a) MGI has agreed to strike the term "letter" from the requirement that the Parent issue a guarantee should doubt arise as to Enron's ability to pay.  
      (b)  Originally the GISB provides that a contract can be terminated without prior notice should certain conditions be met.  MGI wants to change this to require the parties to provide 48 hours notice.  Lourdes told me that she would check to see whether this could be changed to 24 hours prior notice.

#16  The language designating ICC is acceptable, however any redundant language should be stricken.

If this memo is at all unclear, please feel free to call me.  My extension is 52722.  

Alisha Mahabir

This is to quickly summarize our call on July 11 on California gas intrastate matters and set a direction for future activity.

Unbundling:	 PG&E has a Gas Accord in effect through 12/31/03, which is generally positive.  We will participate in the development of a successor plan, and attempt to improve it if we can.
  		SoCalGas attempted its own version of a gas accord, but the CPUC refused to approve.  We will attempt to resurrect this accord and obtain CPUC approval. 

Hedging:  No proceeding currently exists to address gas hedging by LDCs.  (draft legislation does exist on the electric side to allow hedging and passthrough of costs).  Jeff has recommended that we approach the LDCs to begin discussing the issue and developing a strategy to take to the CPUC.  I suggest we develop an ENA-EES hedging proposal for CA and then take that to the LDCs.  I will attempt to put this is writing.

Infrastructure:  CPUC has undertaken a proceeding to determine the need to improve infrastructure.  SoCal Gas and PG&E are responding with proposals.  We want to revitalize the infrastructure and ensure real markets exist and can develop.  Our task is to participate in these proceedings.

(Please let me know who I left off the mailing list).

Just to let you know before it goes out, I have been instructed by Steve Kean that I cannot file separate pleadings for ENA and EES -- we will not have affiliates filing separate documents in the same proceeding at FERC.  The comments you reviewed earlier will be filed in one document by Enron Corp.

Mark, 

Thank you for your help identifying the right speaker for the ZEG/NW Gas Association Conference in Portland - October 3.  I have attached an advanced draft agenda so you can see the line up of executives and topics. We certainly hope that Enron will agree to speak and sponsor....I would recommend the reception sponsorship....I believe a good value for the $.....see attached letter to David Fuller re sponsorship and Sponsorship Detail Sheet. 

As you will see from the agenda, the topic is PRICE...natural gas price.....what I believe would be of interest is the relationship between gas and electric prices in the West....factoring hydro etc.,......identifying the wildcards.... 

The morning of Day 2 is high level - CEO discussions of DEMAND - consumer/industry/gas fired gen and PRICE...as I said Enron - as largest marketer in NA - should be the company delivering the discussion. - This is a GAS industry conference - not a "public" forum.  Louise Kitchen would be an great choice - I've heard she is an excellent presenter - and I believe of equivalent stature to the other a.m. presenters....... 

Thanks...... please give me a call as soon as you can after the holiday.

Gentlemen,

  As you know, I have been working with Steve Lins to negotiate the ISDA agreement so that Enron and the City of Glendale are able to enter into financial transactions.  I spoke with Steve today and he plans to review our latest draft and get back to me with any final changes so that we can send him an executable copy, along with our required documents, for signature next week.  In other words, I am confident that we will have an executed ISDA within the next couple of weeks.

  My boss, Barry Tycholiz, and I are going to be in southern California September 17 & 18 and would like to set up a meeting with you guys to discuss alternatives to swaping out some of your index priced gas supply.  We are available to meet with you after 2 pm on the 17th or at any time on the 18th.  Please let me know when you guys are available and I will set that time aside for you.  

We look forward to meeting with you and expanding our business with the City of Glendale.  Please feel free to call me if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

Mark and Barry

I have talked to Crestone about backing us in a Northern Border transportation deal.  Basically they are on board, however I have not shown them any economics.  What I believe needs to take place is to identify Northern Border shippers who would be willing to release their capacity.  Once we are able to put the capacity release economics together, which will be driven by the Northern Border shippers, we will be able to 
show Crestone a deal.  I do not have any potential parties willing to release Northern Border capacity.  I have talked to the Central desk about this opportunity, they informed me that they had no interest in this type of an arrangement.  I personally believe we can manage ENA's current Northern Border position more efficiently but have been unable to convince others of this.  Any ideas you can provide would be helpful.

Hi, I'm back.

Please fax the IRS notice to me at the number below if you haven't
already
and I'll review it for you.

Regarding the counselling session, I am available tomorrow all day,
Wednesday afternoon after 1:30pm, Thursday afternoon after 2pm and
Friday
after 2pm.  Next week I'll be out of the office Tuesday and Wednesday as
well as Thursday afternoon.  The next week I am out of the office on a

Send me a note when you get back and we can set up a meeting then.

Also, I received a notice from the IRS and it appears that they were
missing information on my wife and as such disallowed me claiming her as
a dependent.  I will send to your attention to review and clarify. Based
on my filing and actual refund there is about a $ 1k difference which I
believe is owed to me.

Good morning Barry,

Just to let you know that I am on holidays August 11-26, so your
counselling will have to be this week or when I return.

Did Enron provide you with approval for a "Post Arrival
Consultation"/PAC?
This is the counselling our PwC Houston office does.  (So, in effect
there
are two possible counselling sessions for assignees - the predeparture
counselling you are supposed to receive before you depart Canada and
then
there's the PAC).  PwC Houston is prepared to set up the "PAC" - they
simply want to know if you received approval for it.

Thanks,

I don't have a problem with it.  I think he would be as good or better of a trader as some of the "kids" I have seen down there losing $30 MM.  At least he has some concept of the physical market and how it works.  I would think to get the best value he would have to be located in Houston for that role.  Especially if Steve wants to "pick his brains".

Mark, I have reviewed resume and although Kevin may have very good trading credentials for this area I am of the opinion that he is a trader and am unclear as to his actual customer contact knowledge... I am sure he knows who they are, not sure if they know who he is other than short dated structures.

Chad,  hope trading is going well.  Weather has been cool so I expect Sumas
basis has been tightening appropriately.   Per our conversation last week,
attached is my resume for your consideration.  Please pass on to the
appropriate people.   I am motivated in finding a position with a
progressive marketing company who could use my experience and knowledge of
the NW gas and electric market and where I can be part of a team that has
much larger view on the markets..   I definitely know that Enron fits that
model...

Thanks, Kevin

Yes, it could be used - with of course excessive costs to buy.
We're currently looking at re-working the code to update.

First of all I want to give you may condolence of what happened yesterday in New York and Washington.  My family and I are praying for all of those who were affected.

I had not received the information that Patty Sullivan told me about the gas flows of August and from you about the first days of this month.  Please call me at your convenience

Update - 

this afternoon Kris, Sarah, Gloria and I talked with Bob Detonte and Carol Consolver from SoCal.  They will provide Kris with information reconciling imbalance data.  They clarified that imbalance trading will be reflected immediately, thus lessening our exposure.  They agreed to several changes in the contract including procedures for posting of margin.  They agreed to consider our requests to increase imbalance tolerance from $2.5 million to $10 million, and to scale the requirement according to our credit rating.  We expect an answer on these latter issues later today or early tomorrow.  The first reaction was that $10 million may be a "little too rich".

Natural Gas Futures and Cash Tumble=20

    Natural gas futures for September delivery on the NYMEX tumbled $0.162 =
to $2.544 per MMBtu yesterday, after hitting a 18-month low on weak overall=
 fundamentals. The October contract dropped $0.154 to $2.582 per MMBtu. The=
 September contract traded at its lowest price since February 2000 when it =
reached a low of $2.53. Bearish fundamentals are triggered by last week's r=
evised storage, mild weather and no tropical storm action on the immediate =
horizon. Last week, the AGA revised the prior week's reported data up 47 Bc=
f in addition to the higher than expect injection for the that week. The fa=
lloff is in preparation for this week's expected much higher than normal.  =
Most of New England and interior New York state will experience mild weathe=
r this as will most of the Pacific coast. Temperatures will turn mild in th=
e Midwest, northern Plains and Northeast later this week, putting more pres=
sure on the market. Look for prices to open lower this morning and continue=
 under pressure. September options expire today and futures tomorrow. Look =
for next support at $2.43 and then $2.39; with resistance seen at $2.83, an=
d then $2.97. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada wa=
s generally $0.15 to $0.20 lower yesterday, except out West where spot pric=
es dipped about $0.05. Natural gas for next day delivery at the Henry hub l=
ost $0.17 to $2.60 per MMBtu.=20

New California Energy Board at Odds with FERC

    In its first meeting, the California Consumer Power and Conservation Fi=
nancing Authority was told that plans to build additional natural gas stora=
ge fields will provide the state with insurance against sudden price hikes =
resulting from supply shortages. California's governor has given the author=
ity for up to $5 billion to build more power plants, add natural gas storag=
e, increase renewable energy, and create conservation incentives. However, =
there are concerns that the agency will dampen enthusiasm for private inves=
tment in the state's beleaguered power system. In order to control their ow=
n destiny, officials say that California needs a sufficient surplus of natu=
ral gas to ensure competition. Mirroring its accusations against power gene=
rators, California has alleged that natural gas pipeline companies created =
non-existent shortages to drive up prices. However, the mandate given to th=
e authority by the governor could put the state on a collision course with =
the FERC, which claims exclusive jurisdiction under the Federal Power Act. =
The authority will expire in 2006, unless the state legislature revives it.

Hey guys, not sure if you are all still at this
address or not but I wanted to get in touch and give
you an update on where I am in case your e-mail
addresses chnaged.

I left San Francisco a couple of months ago and am now
in Sydney Australia with my girlfriend, working on the
federal election campaign for the local Australian
Liberal Party candidate.  It's been a great experience
so far and a lot of fun.  

I'm planning on being back in school in September for
an MBA if I can pull myself together and finish the
applications.  Our apartmnet is nice and close to
Bondi Beach and the Royal Sydney Golf Club so there
are plenty of distractions.   

I'll keep this short because I'm not sure if it will
reach any of you but if it does, it would be reat to
get a quick note back to let me know what's up.  

Dorland, I still owe you a tie by the way.   

I hope everything is going well guys,
Matt

Send me a note when you get back and we can set up a meeting then.

Also, I received a notice from the IRS and it appears that they were
missing information on my wife and as such disallowed me claiming her as
a dependent.  I will send to your attention to review and clarify. Based
on my filing and actual refund there is about a $ 1k difference which I
believe is owed to me.

Good morning Barry,

Just to let you know that I am on holidays August 11-26, so your
counselling will have to be this week or when I return.

Did Enron provide you with approval for a "Post Arrival
Consultation"/PAC?
This is the counselling our PwC Houston office does.  (So, in effect
there
are two possible counselling sessions for assignees - the predeparture
counselling you are supposed to receive before you depart Canada and
then
there's the PAC).  PwC Houston is prepared to set up the "PAC" - they
simply want to know if you received approval for it.

Thanks,

Booking of flights, which will have you departing on Sunday a.m. and arriving  around 12:00 in Denver, have been coordinated by our group to keep control of the flight costs.  We should have you home early on Monday evening ( around 10:30 p.m.). 

We have been able to get some really low fares and I want to keep them that way.  All the Houston based staff plus Portland (Fuller) will come to Denver.

Please see Jessica regarding flight times and schedules. 

A more formal agenda and list of topics/presenters will be sent to each of you in the next couple of days.

If there are any questions, give me a call at 713-853-1587.

Barry,

We normally charge Enron $900 for departure counselling and it involves an
interview of about 2 hours in which we discuss residency, US tax
considerations, etc.  Please let me know when you would like to schedule
the meeting.

Judy, you were?assigned to my U.S and Canadian  tax returns. I am a
employee of Enron North America and previously was an  employee of Enron
Canada in Calgary.

As we had discussed at the time of my filing, I was  never given any
advise
on my relocation to the U.S. regarding tax issues, As  such I am not
sure
what some of my next moves should be.?I very much  require some
assistance?regarding spousal employment. My wife is a  registered nurse
and
would like to work in the U.S., but I have been advised  that this may
affect my filing in the U.S. and perhaps could cost me more in  U.S.
Taxes.

Can we set up a meeting to discuss strategies on  making sure I am going
about this properly.

This is my home e-mail address, you can contact me  here or at my work
address, Barry.Tycholiz@enron.com.

Thanks in advance.

BT

We will but choose the words you use very carefully with regards to what those may be.... LC's, cash are difficult. Basically the most that they are ever exposed to us for is 55 days of gas... and very little mark to market valuations.

     Actually, the money that is in Clarica is part pension and part rrsp, 
     however the pension money, (that should cause it to be locked in) is 
     actually not locked in. I guess that it was not vested. As a result of 
     this, I am looking to transfer it all the one rrsp.
     Let me know if you or Jacy have questions.

     Barry: I will send a note to Jacy. Also the funds I think we will
go 
     into are going to be more heavily weighted towards stocks, but will
     
     have some bonds as well, that what makes them a balanced fund.

I wasn't worried for a second.
     
I would like to have these funds in a portfolio that has a better 
performance than money markets. I already have a decent amount of money 
( 60K) in the Rice portfolio thru andrew agencies in Virden. You may 
want to look at exactly what that is, contact Jacy Whyte at Andrew 
Agencies... he will get you the details for Kim and I. 
     
Was there a particular index fund you had in mind? What do you mean by 
balanced ? Once we put it there I don't plan on touching or managing 
this until I return to Canada.  
     
Thanks, talk to you soon.

     You probably thought I had forgotten about you! I had not. I wanted
to 
     iron out some areas of concern from my end here. As you know, I am
not 
     supposed to do an investment for you while you are a resident of
the 
     US. I have discovered that if we put the money into an account and
not 
     make moves on it until you move back to Canada, then we can do it
if I 
     use a Canadian address. I was advised to put the money into a
balanced 
     fund and leave it there for now. My thoughts are to move it to a 
     couple of funds in a self administered account and NOT make any
moves 
     with it. 
     
     Please review this note, and let me know what you think. If all is
ok 
     I will mail you the forms to sign (which you signed here), and we
will 
     get this moving.
     
     Hope all is well with you down there.

Mr. Tycholiz:

I represent SCE's Energy Supply and Marketing Department with respect to
the above-referenced subject.  It is my understanding that the account
number in Section 2 of the Transaction Agreement Regarding Collateral
("Agreement") is incorrect.  I propose that the parties correct the error
by lining out the incorrect number and inserting by hand the correct one.
I have drafted and attached a letter agreement reflecting that intention.
Please review and call me at your earliest opportunity so tht we may
discuss further.  Thank you.

My dear friends (yes I want something):
I have a proposal in front of Colin for the provision of services and wondered if you might get it back in the conversation at dinner in San Fran.

Actually in all seriousness, Stephanie mentioned that you're meeting with him and I thought you might be interested in seeing what we'd proposed.  Is someone in Producer Services also selling services to Calpine, or would it fall into your shop?

Barry/Mark,

Please see the attached files for the 2002 direct expense plan.  The goal was to reach a combined plan of about $4,220,000.  The numbers included only add up to about $3,905,000 so we can discuss if and where to add the additional $315,000.  I'll try to reach you both at Mark's number around 9:00 Denver time (10:00 Houston time) tomorrow morning.

I called Bill Gaines of Puget to try to relax our credit constraints.  We just traded voicemails, but agreed to talk on Monday.  My general message, unless you have something to add or subtract, will be: "lots has gone on at both companies, makes sense to get together to meet your team to talk about gas and power - probably is more we can be doing together, etc. meeting in late Nov/early Dec".  

Thoughts?

Chris

Would you know, or do you know who would know, whether ENA serves any end use customers off of Southwest Gas's system in Nevada?  We have a case before the Nevada PUC where SW Gas is trying to force transportation customers who return to sales service to sign up for a minimum term of 5 years and then to give one year's notice before they can return to transportation.  Some customers went back to sales because of delivery and pricing problems last winter, so it became an issue (although most of those customers only had to sign up for 1 year of sales).

     Barry:
     
     You probably thought I had forgotten about you! I had not. I wanted to 
     iron out some areas of concern from my end here. As you know, I am not 
     supposed to do an investment for you while you are a resident of the 
     US. I have discovered that if we put the money into an account and not 
     make moves on it until you move back to Canada, then we can do it if I 
     use a Canadian address. I was advised to put the money into a balanced 
     fund and leave it there for now. My thoughts are to move it to a 
     couple of funds in a self administered account and NOT make any moves 
     with it. 
     
     Please review this note, and let me know what you think. If all is ok 
     I will mail you the forms to sign (which you signed here), and we will 
     get this moving.
     
     Hope all is well with you down there.
     
     Regards
     Rob

Mark,

Rate case settlements reached between a pipeline, its customers and Commiss=
ion Staff sometime prescribes the treatment of gains on the sale of assets =
and specifically the sale of base gas volumes (eg Columbia, CNG settlements=
).  In review of the past two rate case settlements of Williston Basin (WBI=
) I found no such provisions.  In its current rate case proceeding before F=
ERC a limited settlement was reached which dealt primarily with net plant a=
nd labor costs.  A hearing was held on all remaining issues and is currentl=
y in the briefing stage.  Neither in the limited settlement, nor in the hea=
ring was disposition of base gas revenues addressed.

However, the reorganizational settlement that conveyed facilities from MDU =
to WBI may be a factor.  As a result of restructuring under 636 WBI was obl=
igated to sell certain excess volumes of company owned working gas (priced =
at $.47 /mcf) to its customers.  WBI proposed to sell the gas at market and=
 retain any profits.  As mentioned in the LeBeoeuf, Lamb memo the Commissio=
n addressed this issues several times, reversing itself in the process, and=
 finally ordered that WBI must sell the working gas at cost.  Though not re=
lying entirely on the reorganizational settlement, throughout the various o=
rders, the Commission referenced the 1985 reorganizational settlement as re=
quiring any gains on the sale of working gas to be flowed through to WBI cu=
stomers.  WBI sought rehearing, arguing that the Commission was taking a ve=
ry broad interpretation of the settlement.  The Commission raised the issue=
 again in its order on rehearing, among other things, and WBI didn't seek r=
ehearing or pursue that particular argument further, which the Commission p=
oints out in its final order.

As LeBeoeuf Lamb asserts, the environment (Order 636 restructuring) in whic=
h the Commission ordered flow-through of profits on the sale of storage vol=
umes has changed and those arguments may not be applicable anymore.  But, t=
he reorganizational settlement might be something to take into account and =
should be discussed with WBI.  Just something to be aware of.

If you have any questions please call.

Robert

We have a very good relationship, and long term gas sale with Thermo Partners who manage the 270 MW Ft. Lupton facility.  They have inquired as to Enron's interest in either buying the energy, tolling or buying the entire plant.  The effective date would be July 2002.  The plant is currently under a QF contract with PSCo.

Mike, I would like to see if you have some time on Monday afternoon to discuss the particulars and we can devise a game plan to get you connected with these guys.  Let me know your availability.

Thanks
Mark

Although the forced ranking creates problems at time, I am satisfied that Ty's ranking is appropriate... 

let's discuss, BT

Barry,

Generally, the seller of an option does NOT incur taxable income on the receipt of an option premium.  Instead, the option premium is held as an "open transaction" (ie. no current tax consequences) until the option is exercised, sold/terminated in a closing transaction, or lapses.  Similarly, the purchaser of an option does not get an immediate tax deduction when it pays an option premium.  

The ultimate tax impact to the option seller and purchaser depends on what happens with the underlying option.  For example, if the option is exercised, then the option seller adds the option premium to the strike price to determine the total amount realized on the sale of the underlying commodity.  (This total amount realized is then used to determine whether the seller has taxable gain or loss on the underlying sale).  From the option purchaser's perspective, the option premium is added to the strike price to determine its tax basis in the underlying commodity.

In the case where the option is allowed to lapse, the option seller treats the option premium as taxable income on the date that the option lapses.  Similarly, the option purchaser takes a deduction for the option premium on the date that the option lapses.

Hopefully this gives you a little bit of an overview of the general rules governing the taxation of options.  Notwithstanding the above overview, I would still like to visit with you regarding the proposed transaction as there are certain "exceptions" or "nuances" to the general rules that could apply.  As such, once you have had a chance to review, please give me a call at ext. 3-5846 so that we can discuss further.  Thanks.

MRC

Morris... if ENA were to sell options to a third party and receive the option premium up front... for example $ 10MM $'s.... would that be considered taxable income?

We would also be buying the option from another party or hedging this structure and this cash would be used to offset future liabilities related to the deal.

Our liability should be limited to recoveries from the insurances required in the contract and specifically purchased for work under this contract. If covered by the policy, we will respond.  Losses, costs and expenses not recovered from the insurance, shall remain the obligation of Citizens. 

Once again, if they agree to the limitation, the continued concerns would be:
1. The indemnity would be set aside by a court.
2. The indemnity from Citizens does not hold or they are financially unable to respond.

Please advise if there are further questions.

Barry,

How are you? Just want to say hi. It must be a very hectic week and
stressful. With the talents of people at Enron such as yourself being the
major asset of the company, the industry recognizes that fact. I am sure
that you will do well. In the mean time, hold tight, pray, and have faith. 

Keep in touch.

PSIM: A Power Simulation Tool

PSIM is a proprietary model developed by Enron Research Group.

?	It takes Power, Gas, Weather and demand information into consideration and 
	uses Monte-Carlo simulation to assess the expected deal value and risk distribution. 
?	It evaluates complex electricity related contracts such
as Full Requirement  and load following contract. 
?	It also provides a valuation tool for power assets and asset management deals.
?	It works for both deal specific or portfolio issues.

In this presentation we will show how the model can be used to deal with various types 
of contracts, explain the model structure and point out further applications. 

Date:		October 30, 2001
Time: 	4:00 pm

Barry, 

It is working great.  Thanks for the support.  One small format issue......Phil has it titled Pacific Gas & Electric Company and it should be PG&E Energy Trading - Gas Corporation.

Mike, further to our conversation of this week.. let's get together early next week... ( Tues ) to sit down and hash out expectations of Jane and Keith as they relate to your needs, my needs and how they mutally benefit our efforts.
 
I think we may have to formalize the reporting process on the regulatory but before I worry about that, I am more interested in you and me working out expectations... we may be far off as to what the priorities are and as such our regulatory focus may need to splinter.
 
I have decided to go up to Canada for a couple days to handle some family affairs.  I can be reached on my cell, otherwise I will talk to you on tues.

Subject:	El Paso's Bid to Hike Export Capacity Opposed 

NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
published : September 20, 2001
El Paso's Bid to Hike Export Capacity Opposed 
Southwest local distribution utilities and municipal distributors have called on FERC to reject, or convene a technical conference to consider, El Paso Natural Gas' application to boost export capacity on the Samalayuca Lateral by about 100 MMcf/d to meet natural gas demand in northern Mexico. They argue that such action would deprive existing El Paso customers of already-tight capacity on the pipeline's South Mainline. 
There are a number of ongoing cases at the Commission addressing the limited capacity on the El Paso system, and its capacity-allocation procedures, the distributors pointed out. "Yet...El Paso proposes to allow a unilateral reallocation of 100,000 Mcf./d of capacity to serve customers outside the United States without fully disclosing from which customer the capacity will come and its likely impact on all these pending matters," said Southern Union Gas Co. The utility asked the Commission to convene a technical conference. 
Southwest Gas Corp. and the El Paso Municipal Customer Group said they were concerned the proposed increase in the lateral's capacity may "adversely affect" them and other customers because capacity on the South Mainline would be needed to move the additional export load. FERC "should not approve increased export capacity without a corresponding increase in mainline capacity" on El Paso's system, they said. 
Southwest and the municipal distributors urged the Commission to either: 1) reject the El Paso application outright; 2) in the alternative, set the case for hearing to assess the impact on existing customers; or 3) absent rejection or hearing, defer consideration of the application until other pending cases related to the level of capacity on El Paso are resolved. 
In its application, El Paso asked FERC for the go-ahead to increase the maximum daily export capacity on the lateral by about one-third to 308 MMcf/d to correspond with the "rapid development" of the gas infrastructure in the northern Mexico state of Chihuahua. It said it already had entered into a long-term agreement for the entire proposed increase of 100 MMcf/d of export capacity with MGI Supply Ltd (See Daily GPI, Aug. 31 <d20010831e.html>).

The Origination Track manual is being drafted by Tom Wilbeck and Ted Bland in HR. We should have a copy to circulate for your comments shortly.

1) Attached is a list of potential Origination Track candidates. These are analysts and associates ranked 1, 2 or 3 who have had at least one rotation in a relevant area. These are people who could be interviewed by us to determine if they would be a good fit for the track. Please have a look at the list. If you spot any errors or omissions, please let me know.

 
2) There are an additional 30 analysts and associates who have relevant rotations, but who have not yet been ranked. Any who rank 1-3 could be additional candidates for us to interview.

3) In addition, any analyst - 2 or associate - 1's who rank 1-3 could be candidates for the track. I will forward this list when received from HR.

I will forward lists #2 and #3 once I have the info.

Dave

In all cases except for Hallwood, ENA Denver has a relationship with these customers that primarily covers their physical business, we would like to expand that business to cover their Derivative business as well.  The list is based on priority.  We would be willing to cover them for their West Gas business only.  Fred could continue to cover their East, Central and Oil/Liquids business.

Don Baldridge indicated that they would prefer to front-load the re-priced swap, with a higher price next year and a market-based price for '03-'05 and no lump sum payout this year.  This structure probably works better for us also due to the increased focus on funds flows.

I also have John Disturnal (ENA Canada) pricing up an at the money swaption for '03-'05, which might be an attractive hedge for Crestone.  Don is going to run some traps on his end and get back to me this afternoon.

(there may have been a third).  The PD by ALJ Brown denied the application.
The PD by Cmmr. Bilas allowed it to go forward, subject to conditions.  The

Craver will head up any of these specific deals that Edison enters into.  I've known Fielder for a long time (very much the company guy, but pretty easy to work with).  I've met Craver, but don't know him as well as Fielder.  Won't be a stretch to get a meeting with Craver if we choose to do it.  Edison is the counterparty.  Regarding the credit issue, in addition to Edison, we should also view the California PUC as a "co-counterparty" to just about anything Edison does over the next 24 months or so.

Jeff

Jeff, I was talking to Mike Etringer yesterday regarding this subject and he gave me the name of the CFO Ted Craver. I understand that you guys were dealing with John Fielder.  
 
For sure we want to know what they are up to.  I think like all deals in California we are going to run into issues with credit, and probably paper but that would pretty much depend on the counterparty. ( is it edison), or DWR? 
 
It is VERY important that trading and marketing are aware of the hedging activities in a very timely fashion so however we need to ensure that happens will be my plan. 
 
Do you know the CFO ?

The Enron Center Garage has opened.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new building and are currently parking in an Enron Contract garage or on the parking waitlist you are being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. 

The  Sky Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until  Sky Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a an information packet for the new garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions.

I just spoke with Krystal at Kern and John Stafford at Patina:
Kern Legal will not finish reviewing until Monday.  At that time they will approve, revise, or reject the changes to the Assignment Agreement.  I reiterated that Enron is comfortable with the changes.
John Stafford is comfortable with Gerald's Indemnity Letter Agreement (below), but would strongly prefer to have the indemnity language incorporated into the Assignment Agreement itself, if it is possible in a timely fashion.
John indicated he would be willing to conference in with Gerald and Kern's attorney(s) first thing Monday morning if we felt it would be helpful.
Bottom line:  It looks like we can shut the door on this, one way or the other, on Monday morning.

UNION members:

The attached presentation provides one format to develop a general orig "plan" for attacking the industrial market.  The objective is to encapsulate our "common view" of the industrial market opportunities, resource strategy, product strategy, etc..(it also shows Louise that we are working together), .   A more specific plan would be needed for each region driven by specific market needs.   There is no pride of authorship for this format - changes/rewrites are expected.

I you agree this has some value as a way to capture the results of our discussions, I will have an Associate from my group, JD Buss, to develop this further and coordinate comments and input from you or someone on your teams.  Let JD know who he should get in touch with.

Regards,
Brian

Dave, I will provide as much detail as possible but may not have all the detail that you are requesting below.  I think that a history of the general activity will help identify the problem and/or potential problem.

ENA East Gas has been working with all of the major Northeast clients (New Jersey Natural, PSE&G, NUI, South Jersey, KeySpan etc.) on gas products and services.  EES has requested that the Regulatory Affairs group use their contacts with those clients to get EES in to meet with Sr. Management.  These are ENA's primary target markets.
The West and Central groups within ENA have witnessed the same encroachment with EES requesting wholesale customer lists and contacts.
Texas has bumped into EES more in the industrial sector then in the LDC/IOU client base.
EES Product Approach - As I understand it EES is proposing to support regulatory changes (where needed) that would allow the wholesale entity to provide market based products and services to retail clients in exchange for EES being the exclusive provider of such product/service to the wholesale entity for redelivery to the retail entity.  To date, I am not aware of any actual proposals that have been provided.  However, as you can see the approach creates confusion for our customers.

I would like to confirm EES's product/service offering and determine from them if they are directly approaching our wholesale customers.

Frank

Frank,

Thanks for offering to help assembling this info.

If you could include the following in your list, that would be great (and consistent with what we are pulling together for Power):

Company
Timeframe (when contact occurred)
ENA Rep (in case we need to follow up for further details)
Notes ( a few words description of issue)

Dave

Greetings Steve:

We have had many inquiries regarding our transportation agreements, specifically PGT, Kern River and El Paso.  

Most pressing is PGT's request to market capacity on our behalf. Although I do not believe we need to have PGT perform this function, I do believe we could mitigate some demand charge exposure for "the estate".  

Are you available to meet with Barry and I first thing tomorrow morning? We need to have an answer for PGT's request. We need to know what the contractual rights are for 1) the pipeline when a shipper declares bankruptcy and 2) our ability to mitigate demand charge exposure by releasing capacity on a short term basis (month at a time?).

Better yet, can we unilaterally turn capacity back to any of these pipes or do we need to reach some type of court approved settlement?

Obviously, we have many questions. Please advise of your ability to meet ASAP.

Thanks,

Stephanie

Talked to Mark.

First thing he has to do is convince Davis' lawyers that his companies' client list (which includes TW) shouldn't conflict him out of working on DWR gas deals.
He should have that figured out by this week--sounds like he may have to make some decisions about his current client list and working for DWR.
I told him that we'd like to sit down as soon as possible to discuss opportunities for us to help out DWR with its gas needs.
He said that he'd be happy to do that, once he's got all conflict issues worked out with the Governor's office.
He's going to get back to me to set up a meeting; and if I don't hear from him by Monday/Tuesday of next week, I'll call him back to set up a meeting.
I'm assuming that you'd be part of that meeting?
I asked him what sort of deals they're working on. As you likely know, some of the contracts permit DWR to either 1) provide gas to the plant providing DWR power under the power contract or 2) manage the plant's fuel supply.  So they're looking to get "soup-to-nuts" supply service for those contracts that include a fuel-supply option.

Best,
Jeff

I am really only available Monday am (I am on a well-deserved vacation next week), but if that works for you, that would be great.  Jeff is pretty full up with the CA legislature and all the electric stuff.  We can try him, tho.  What I would like is to come up with a coherent message on hedging in CA, particularly the core-non-core issues, so that at the end of the day, EES still has a market and ENA can sell hedges to the LDCs.  Sue Landwehr in Gov Affairs is the leader/coordinator of our hedging activities before the state commissions and we should get her involved as well.  In fact I will cc both Sue and Jeff on this.

Subject:	CA Instrate Gas matters

This is to quickly summarize our call on July 11 on California gas intrastate matters and set a direction for future activity.

Unbundling:	 PG&E has a Gas Accord in effect through 12/31/03, which is generally positive.  We will participate in the development of a successor plan, and attempt to improve it if we can.
  		SoCalGas attempted its own version of a gas accord, but the CPUC refused to approve.  We will attempt to resurrect this accord and obtain CPUC approval. 

Hedging:  No proceeding currently exists to address gas hedging by LDCs.  (draft legislation does exist on the electric side to allow hedging and passthrough of costs).  Jeff has recommended that we approach the LDCs to begin discussing the issue and developing a strategy to take to the CPUC.  I suggest we develop an ENA-EES hedging proposal for CA and then take that to the LDCs.  I will attempt to put this is writing.

Infrastructure:  CPUC has undertaken a proceeding to determine the need to improve infrastructure.  SoCal Gas and PG&E are responding with proposals.  We want to revitalize the infrastructure and ensure real markets exist and can develop.  Our task is to participate in these proceedings.

(Please let me know who I left off the mailing list).

Barry,
Here you go! As long as you guys are just using this as a template, then it should be o.k. If you are using the numbers to value deals, you may want to verify them as there are a few pipes that I haven't updated in a while.

We are or may be building a tariff ( book ) for our West Gas Orig desk and I keep telling them I want to look like the canadian version...

Subject:	RE: Northwest Pipeline Discussions: LNG Terminal


Dear Colleagues:

Yesterday, Jeff Slaughter of ENA, Kyu-bong Lee and myself met with Northwest Natural Gas'  Nick Potts, Director - Gas Storage Operations, Charles Stinson, General Manager - Engineering Services & Storage, and Randy Friedman, Manager - Gas Supply.

Full report on the meeting is attached, here is a summary of the main points:

They do not object to the development of an LNG terminal by Enron on the Columbia river or to Enron's efforts to negotiate a land lease option at Port Westward.  Their pipeline system is not set up to take advantage of the regasified LNG to supply their core customers in Portland but they would consider buying directly from us for customers in the Port Westward, St. Helens, Longview area if the price was right, i.e., the lower of Sumas and Stanfield price MINUS some discount from the NW Pipeline postage stamp tariff.
They perceive some risk in relying on an LNG supply with price formula linked to Nymex that would not provide a floor for the LNG producer.
They would like to see the LNG terminal in southern Oregon, where the NW pipeline system telescopes down to 10 inches, but realize that the terminal would be lost somewhere around Coos Bay with over 150 miles to go to connect with the PGT line across the Coastal Range and the Cascades, through an area of strong environmental concerns.
At this point, the best option for Enron seems to be (pending positive report on navigational issues on the Columbia from Golder): 
a terminal close to the N/W Pipeline in the Port Westward/Longview area
selling gas directly to local customers (i.e., bypassing NW P/L transportation charges)
selling rest of gas on NW P//L
Eventually, we will need to talk to the Kelso Beaver (KB) Pipeline which operates the small diameter line to Port Westward.

Please give me a call if you have any questions.

Best,

Z

PG&E called.  They want to set up a conference call to brief us on the gas piece of their POR that they'll be filing with FERC around November 30th.  They want to try to do it in the next couple of weeks. Please let me know if you're interested and please pass this along to anyone else who might be interested.  Thanks.

WILLIAMS PUTS MEAT ON THE BONES OF WESTERN FRONTIER PROJECT DESIGN

Touting a need for more pipeline capacity linking the "prolific" supply basins of the central Rockies and increasingly hungry Mid-Continent markets, The Williams Cos. Inc. last week took the next step by filing for authorization to build and operate the Western Frontier project.

The sponsor has in hand four negotiated-rate deals for long-term service covering roughly two-thirds of the 540,000 Dt/day of project design capacity, it told FERC in an Oct. 24 certificate application (CP02-11). Williams wants to have the $366 million project up and running by Nov. 1, 2003; it asked the commission to issue a final certificate by Dec. 11, 2002, so that it can commence construction by the following April.

Williams unveiled initial plans for Western Frontier early last summer (IF, 9 July, 14) and held an open season in June and July. To carry gas from the Power River, Big Horn, Wind River and Green River basins- estimated to hold 173 Tcf of potential and recoverable reserves - the new 30-inch-diameter mainline would run 398 miles, starting at the Cheyenne Hub and ending at an interconnection with the system of affiliate Williams Gas Pipelines Central Inc. in Beaver County, Okla. Characterizing the Cheyenne Hub as "a liquid point of supply," Williams asserted that "presently, supply capability to the hub has outpaced transportation capacity away from the hub to market areas due to insufficient pipeline infrastructure."

Along the way, the Western Frontier mainline would make another interconnection with Williams Central as well as with Northern Natural Gas Co., ANR Pipeline Co., Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America and Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co., "thus providing multiple avenues for gas produced in the central Rockies to be transported throughout the Mid-Continent using the existing pipeline grid."

To "further enhance its supply options," the sponsor wants to build a 9.7-mile lateral from the mainline to the Wattenberg gas processing plant east of Denver to tap the Denver-Julesberg basin. Rounding out the project design are two new compressor stations, the 10,000-horsepower Chalk Bluff station to be constructed at the Cheyenne Hub and the 20,000-hp Denver station to be built in Adams County, Colo. Following the open season, Williams hammered out precedent agreements with Marathon Oil Co. (75,000 Dt/day), Williams Energy Marketing and Trading Co. (200,000 Dt/day), Utilicorp United Inc. (15,000 Dt/day) and Entergy Power Generation Corp. (75,000 Dt/day). The initial term for the deals is 10 years, except for Marathon which committed to a five-year term with an option to extend it an additional two years, said the application.

"Other shippers have expressed serious interest for the remaining capacity on Western Frontier, and active negotiations are moving forward with these potential shippers," said the application, adding that Williams was "confident . . . that the remaining capacity will be committed in the upcoming months." With the addition of compression, the project could "facilitate relatively inexpensive expansions to accommodate future market growth," the sponsor told FERC. And that may well be necessary, it continued, pointing to "stagnant to declining supply" in the Mid-Continent basins coupled with "projected demand increases." As in many areas of the country, "much of the anticipated demand increase is attributed to installation and operation of . . . gas-fired electrical generation," it said. The 11,439 Mw of "active winter generating capacity" in the combined service areas of Western Frontier and Williams Central is expected to more than double by 2004, said Williams.

The application seeks negotiated rate authority for the project operator, Western Frontier Pipeline Co. LLC, and approval of initial recourse rates. The maximum daily reservation rate under schedule FTS would be 35?/Dt for contract demand in Zone 1 and 79.4?/Dt in Zone 2. Under the negotiated deals reached with the four "anchor" shippers, Utilicorp and Entergy would pay a combined reservation and commodity rate of 25?/Dt at a 100% load factor for Zone 1 service to the Williams Central Hugoton station in Kansas, while WEM&T would pay a combined rate of 30?/Dt for Zone 2 transportation to the Williams Central system in Oklahoma and Marathon would pay 32?/Dt under the shorter contract for Zone 2 service to interconnects with ANR, Panhandle and Williams Central in
Oklahoma. All transportation would originate at the Cheyenne Hub.

Barry -

Could you go through the attached customer list and match up our customer name with the correct counterparty name.  We are working with credit to figure out who has master firm and master swap agreements in place. 

Please mark your changes in yellow.

I can confirm Peter's assertion that the changes we have requested to the Canadian form have yet to be incorporated into the US form. Generally, the US form is the same as the form which PG&E provided to ECC back in 2000 (with the exception that the US form has been amended to contemplate confirmations through EnronOnline and the insertion of the price indices to use to calculate liquidated damages).  As a result, some of our comments (i.e. the idea that a transaction is entered at the time of the telephone conversation/online transaction and is not dependent upon a confirmation being issued) would apply equally to both the US form and the Canadian form.

 However, there are a number of changes which would have no bearing on the US form.  They are:

1.	insertion of representations and warranties relating to:
a.  eligible financial contracts under Canadian insolvency law;
b.  certain Canadian securities representations;

2.	amendments to Article 4 - Delivery Point - whereby the delivery point is to be in Canada (However, the US Form does contain the clause relating to extraction rights at Cochrane Extraction Point (in s.4.1) which we are seeking to fix.);

3.	amendments to the liquidated damages mechanics in the Canadian form which utilize AECO/NIT as a basis.  The amended US Form includes a number of alternative indices (however, the amended US form does not contemplate changes to or lack of availability of the chosen indices); and

4.	in Article 11, amendments to the Canadian form re: Delivery Point force majeure may not be applicable to the US form.

In addition to the Canadian jurisdiction matters, there are certain amendments which we are seeking for Enron Canada which are not applicable to the US form.  These requests were needed for the Canadian form because PG&E's counsel made a number of unsolicited changes to the Canadian form in his draft in May, 2001 which are not found in the US form.  For example:

1.	amendments to section 2.2 on tape retention is not necessary in the US form as there is merely an obligation to protect the tapes from improper access (as oppose to an obligation to protect the tapes from loss or tampering);

2.	      our amendments to the payment netting provisions of section 7.7 are not necessary for the US form as the US form does not restrict netting of payments solely to monthly payments for Gas deliveries;

3.	      our proposed amendments to the collateralization provisions of section 8.2 are not as key as the US form does not have a clause which (i) would effectively bar Enron from calling for collateral or (ii) include an acknowledgement that any security may require the approval of the Bankruptcy Court; and

4.	      our proposed changes to section 8.3 are not applicable as the US form does not provide PG&E with the excuse of "lack of Bankruptcy Court consent" with respect to the provision of collateral.

Hopefully, this gives you an idea of where we are at with the two documents.  If you have further questions prior to our meeting tomorrow, please give me a call at 820-6708.

Thanks,

Mark

Mark can do, but as general proposition I think tht you can assume that none of the changes to the Canadian form have been made to the US form, some of which will be jurisdictional to Canada and others of which will not.  Mark please prepare a brief summary.

If one of the exercises is to standardize ( as best as possible the two agreements) I think we need to create a document that identifies the variance in the agreements. Has this been done and if so, can I have a copy to review. I have gone through both the US and Canadian agreements but am not sure where some of the subtle differences lie.

Call if you want to discuss.

Barry:

This is the insurance language that would appear in the contract between Enron Asset Management Resources (EAMR) and Citizens.  I will send you a second e-mail that summarizes the proposed deal between EAMR and ENA.  As we discussed I would like you to look at this insurance arrangement and see if ENA has any risk.  My view of it is that this creates no risk to ENA, but I have not structured a deal in this way before and would appreciate a second opinion. 

Thanks

Steph, as you know we are not a shipper in this expansion, and I do not foresee any issues related to Enron other than the primary delivery point service that Kern continues to put into Wheeler ( although ) kern maintains this is a takeaway issue, not  delivery. I do not see us filing on this issue however, do you? 

Pls advise if you have a different opinion, but I see no reason for ENA to intervene.

We actually use the same airplanes for both NBA and NHL. They were
originally configured for the NBA then we added some hockey teams to our
contract. There are 12 international first class seats and a table with
four chairs in the front cabin, the middle has 2 tables with 4 chairs and
an additional 4 world business class seats, then the back has 24 domestic
first class seats and a sofa. They are old 727's that were reconfigured.
Obviously, the NBA players sit in the front cabin since that was the idea
of the 12 seats, and coaches in the middle with tables to work,  but the
hockey players sit in the middle and back with coaches and staff occupying
the front or middle. Each Hockey teams seating is different depending on
the teams preference. Just to have a private flight makes the hockey guys
happy. Most of them still remember when they had to fly commercial. They
are not too picky. And with the steller service we provide, they don't even
notice the decor!!!

Off to bang that little white ball around grass, sand and trees!

See ya,

Debra

Hi, Barry,

To help me prepare for our meeting:

What role does Stephanie play?

Will you be speaking for both Canada and US when we talk?

Most important: Do you like paella?

We need to discuss this NBPL opportunity and how we can front run Tenaska. As discussed there is a ton of Canadian Producers who own this pipe and if we can structure a deal to segment the pipe that has Rockies gas supply attached to it we should pursue.

Mark/Barry--- I finally had a chance to look this week at the Colorado PUC proposed rulemaking amendments regarding price risk management (PRM) for gas utilities.  As we had generally talked about, the appetite for meaningful change to the PUCs rules has been pretty weak by staff and to a great extent by the Commissioners themselves.  These proposed rules reflect some movement toward encouraging utilties to implement PRM, but does NOT require them to implement, nor is there a clear statement that the PUC will allow recovery of costs.  Here's a short list of what's in the rules:

	> costs related to prm may be allowed, and new language is added to better define the standard of review as "whether the utility action was reasonable in light of the information known, or should have been known, at the time of action or inaction".    

	> in the utility's annual Gas PUrchase Plan they must include an exhibit that describes and analyzes the steps the utility has taken to reduce gas price volatility.  It appears to be an informational filing only, but clearly signals that the PUC expects them to take some action or explain why they didn't. 

	> the utility's actual portfolio purchases, included in the costs of purchasing risk managment products,  need to be included in a Gas Purchase Report to be filed annually. This report presumably is the document that the PUC will then use to determine reasonableness of gas cost pass thru.


There are numerous areas that we could comment on in this proposed rulemaking---anywhere from pushing them to be more explicit in advocating that the utility must do prm and that they will recover the costs, to something along the line of turning over their gas supply portfolio to a company that can more effectively manage it.  There is a hearing scheduled for November 1 in Denver, with comments due on or before October 21.  

We would be happy to intervene and file comments in the proceeding and work the issue if you guys would like us to. Might be kind of fun to tweak our friends at Xcel just a bit! Is there a time on Monday Oct 8 or Tuesday Oct 9 that we could talk via phone to determine your level of interest?  I am available mid day on Monday (between 10 and 2:30 central) or Tuesday anytime up until about 3:30.  Please let me know via return e mail or give me a call   #612-339-4599

Greetings:

1) I haven't forgot about Baldwin, but it seems that things have changed for him (and his company?).  His long-standing number know longer works and there's no forwarding number.  I'm trying to track him down.

2) What time's your weekly meeting on Thursday, and is there a call-in number?

Best,
Jeff

John, here is a brief summary of the Williston Basin Storage.... The numbers don't lie... the cushion gas is 160Bcf in the ground sitting idle. It is huge..with 20 bcf of working gas!  Is that some idle capital or what?   

.. There is alot of history here and Mark Whitt and I have been discussing structures/ideas. I will update you immediatly if we are able to kindle something.  

Pls advise if any direct / comments.

Is this what you think John wants to see, or should we go into more detail?  I tried to get the storage guys a meeting with these guys earlier in the summer but I was not successful.  I do not know if they were ever successful in getting that meeting.  I do not think so.

     Barry, I just sent out your stuff to get you to sign and return, and I 
     just realized I forgot to put a return envelope in there, (cheap 
     bugger). My apologies.
     
     I am just transferring it to a money market fund until it all gets 
     there,then I will do the direction from there, and I will let you know 
     which funds I think will do the job then.

Barry,

I've left hard copies of the attached on your desk.  The EPNG document is my memo regarding the information you had requested on EPNG's tariffs, etc.  The Marathon Oil doc shows the deltas on the legs of the PNM sale.  The +757 thousand change from Thursday's value is primarily due to an increase in Winter 02/03 border prices and a drop in SJ basis from Nov 02 out.  

Please let me know should you have any questions.

Phil

Regarding our discussions about the subject issue, I believe that the following orders would sufficiently document FERC's policy regarding solicitation of capacity turnback from existing customers to get El Paso's attention:

>From "Order Denying Rehearing and Accepting Compliance Filing", issued  March 19, 2001, Mississippi Canyon Gas Pipeline, LLC, Docket No. RP00-226-002 and -003 (94 FERC ? 61,324)

Prior Solicitation of Capacity Turnback

BP claims (Petition at 4-7) that MCGP should be required to solicit the voluntary turnback of capacity from its shippers prior to requiring them to submit production profiles.  As BP correctly notes (Petition at 4-5), the Commission did state in the Northern Border case that a pipeline should solicit turnback capacity from its shippers before filing an application to construct expansion facilities.

7Northern Border Pipeline Company, 90 FERC ? 61,263 at 61,879 (2000).


>From "Order Issuing Certificate", issued March 16, 2000, Northern Border Pipeline Company, Docket Nos. CP99-21-000, CP99-21-001, and CP99-21-002 (90 FERC ? 61,263)

Further, we find below that Northern Border properly applied the Commission's policy regarding the solicitation of turnback capacity.  (from Footnote 46)

and

We conclude that Northern Border properly complied with the Commission's requirement that pipelines solicit turnback capacity before filing an application for authority to construct new capacity.


Do you want to talk to them again before we send them a letter?  Let me know what they say.

Gerald, I have attached a term sheet that I would like you to review.

As I mentioned we need to determine which contract we will use for these deals, (dedicated reserves or enfolio).  
In addition, we need to send renegotiation letters to several of the parties.  If you need the list Theresa can provide it.

Let me know your thoughts as soon as you can.

Mark

Subject:=09One Way vs. Two Way Payments

I have reviewed the master physical gas agreements for the 10 counterpartie=
s (excluding trading companies) at the top of the exposure list to determin=
e whether the contracts contemplate one-way or two-way payments.

1.  Petro Canada Oil & Gas - One Way
2.  Canadian Natural Resources - Two Way
3.  Marathon Canada Limited - One Way
4.  Husky Oil Operations Limited - One Way
5.  Murphy Canada Exploration Company - One Way
6.  Encal Energy Ltd. - One Way
7.  Talisman Energy Inc. - One Way
8.  Premstar Energy Canada Ltd. - Two Way
9.  Rio Alto Exploration Ltd. - One Way
10.  Sunoco Inc. - Two Way

The basic operation of a one way payment provision is that, if the defaulti=
ng party has a net in-the-money position based upon the Early Termination D=
amages calculation, the Early Termination Damages are deemed to be zero and=
 the non-defaulting party is not required to pay that amount to the default=
ing party (the defaulting party's position is wiped out).  However, we woul=
d still be entitled, prior to default, to call for collateral where a count=
erparty's out-of-the money position is in excess of its collateral threshol=
d, which would provide us with security to ensure the counterparty continue=
s to pay.  In addition, if the counterparty failed to post such collateral,=
 they would be in default, we could terminate the contract and, as the non-=
defaulting party, we would be in a position to realize on our in-the-money =
position.  If, after we received the collateral, we were then to become ins=
olvent or otherwise default under the master, the counterparty could termin=
ate the contract, our mark-to-market position would be wiped out and we wou=
ld be required to return any unused collateral.

The operation of a two way payment provision is that the early termination =
damages are calculated by the non-defaulting party and whoever has a net in=
-the-money position based upon such calculation is owed the termination pay=
ment, regardless of whether such party is the defaulting or non-defaulting =
party.  In other words, unlike a one way payment, if the defaulting party h=
as a net in-the-money position upon termination of the contract, the non-de=
faulting party will be required to pay that amount to the defaulting party.=
  Therefore, if we were to become insolvent or otherwise default under a ma=
ster and we had a net in-the-money position under that master, the counterp=
arty could terminate the contract but we would still be owed our mark-to-ma=
rket position.  The other point to consider in the situation where there is=
 a two way payment provision is that, of the three counterparty masters abo=
ve that contain two way payments, all three also contain cherry picking lan=
guage that, upon the occurrence of an event of default other than insolvenc=
y, allows the non-defaulting counterparty to pick and choose which transact=
ions to terminate.  In other words, the counterparty need not terminate all=
 transactions, which could effect the amount otherwise owed to the defaulti=
ng party.  Even with cherry-picking, upon the occurrence of an insolvency, =
all transactions are deemed to terminate, so cherry picking would not be a =
factor.

You had also asked whether the failure by a party to call for collateral wh=
en it is entitled to under a contract would have an impact on the ability o=
f such party to collect on a termination payment owed to it upon terminatio=
n of the contract.  Other than the fact that the failure to call for collat=
eral may mean that we do not hold credit support that would be usable to of=
fset a termination payment owing if the party obligated to pay fails to pay=
, the right to call for collateral is just that, a right and not an obligat=
ion, and the failure to call for collateral does not colour the right of th=
e party owed the termination payment to require it be paid.

Let me know if you need anything further with respect to this matter.

Greetings.  I'm assuming that we're still on for the call.  Let me know.  Hope things have calmed down somewhat since the deal was announced on Friday.

Best,
Jeff

Understanding that many things can change dramatically between now and next Thursday, we are nonetheless scheduled to call Jim Scilacci at 4 PM CST on Thursday, November 15th.

This project has been noticed by FERC (CP01-422).  Adds 906,626 dth/day (845,500 Mcf) of capacity from Opal, WY to delivery points primarily in California.  Service commencing 5/1/2003.  Incremental rates and fuel.   Seventeen shippers have signed 18 long-term agreements (10 or 15 years) and 95% has primary delivery points in California, mostly for existing and new power generation.

Any issues?  Are we a shipper?  Comments and interventions are due Aug. 29th.  Since I will be in D.C. that week, need your input by Aug. 23rd.  

We are downloading a copy of the filing (392 pages).  Let me know if you would like a copy.

Thanks to each of you who help in the review process yesterday.  As many of you know, we found that several of the contracts that we reviewed did reconcile with the Total Exposure (in other words, the agreements were not the right ones).  Eric Moon and Russell Diamond are working with IT, Credit and Risk to access deal specific information in a way that will let us link deal numbers to contract numbers.  Thereafter we can get the right agreements and finish the process.  I will update you later today on the status.  If you have any questions, please ask.
Ed

You mentioned a gas outsourcing presentation.  Could I get a copy of that?  I am looking for examples of good ideas that can be applied to power - we have a current lapse in creativity!

In order to get Kim Ward VPN access from her Click@Home or non-enron PC, I will need you to e-mail my manager, Paige Cox, with the number of people in your group that need to work from home and the business reason behing it. Once Paige gets approval, I will be able to assist Kim and the rest of your group get the VPN access from thier homes.

In furtherance of discussions between our commercial counterparts (Barry Tycholiz, Eric Le Dain and Ray Welch) and our meeting tentatively scheduled for next week, we have made certain anticipatory revisions to the agreement reflected in the document attached entitled the "Comprehensive Blackline". 

We also attach a blackline of the agreement which separately indicates these most recent changes (as compared to the version which we sent to you on July 3, 2001)(the "Incremental Blackline").

The Incremental Blackline includes a number of changes which address concerns communicated by Ray Welch.  Most importantly, we have removed the concept of set-off of obligations of the affiliates of non-defaulting parties.  We have also reinserted the concept of "Interruptible" transactions; however, we have clarified that "Baseload Gas", "Multi-Month Gas" and "Swing Gas" transactions shall be firm.

In addition to the foregoing, we have proposed a number of other amendments which help clarify the representations, obligations and transacting procedures under the agreement.  For example, we have distinguished payment defaults from other failures as events constituting "Defaults".

Similarly, we have amended the confirmation procedures of Article 2 to clarify the mechanics of transacting.  As you saw in our previous comments, Enron Canada wants to clarify that, although the practice is to always send a Confirmation Notice, a transaction is not dependent on a Confirmation Notice.  In addition, the Incremental Blackline includes amendments which eliminate the potential confusion/uncertainty which would arise in the event that Confirmation Notices were issued by both parties.  Section 2.4 has been amended such that only one party confirms the transactions.  In this case, because Enron Canada will be issuing the Confirmation Notices for all Enron Online transactions, we have inserted Enron Canada as the party to issue the Confirmation Notice for all transactions, subject to a three business day review period. 

Should you have any questions or concerns relating to our proposed changes prior to the meeting, please give me a call.  You can reach me directly at (403) 974-6708.

Regards,

Mark Powell

Attached are three documents (cover memo, draft settlement proposal,
settlement procedures timeline) comprising SRP's formal proposal to resolve
five pending dockets, RP99-507 (Indicated Shippers' Complaint), RP00-336
(Order No. 637 Allocation and Pooling Issues only), RP99-139 (ONEOK
Complaint), RP01-484 (Indicated Shippers/California Complaint), and RP01-48=
6
(Texas, New Mexico and Arizona Shippers' Complaint). We appreciate the
suggestions received to date and believe that while an uncontested
settlement may be unlikely, a sufficient nucleus is forming around the
elements of this proposal that will lead to the filing of an Offer of
Settlement and ultimate FERC approval as in the public interest.  We
encourage your active participation in this process.

Note that while Advisory Staff present at the July 18 Technical Conference
is aware conceptually that SRP will be distributing a settlement proposal,
this proposal has not been distributed to the Advisory Staff.  This proposa=
l
has been sent to Rick Miles, Director, Dispute Resolution Services, for
informational purposes only at this time.

Attached for your review are a draft of the gas Confirmation and associated GTC.  Also attached is a clean and redlined version of the Agency and Management Agreement.  A few minor tweaks were made.  We also added some information requirements concerning your gas supply deals.  Please review.  Thanks for your help.

Tyrell,  I Kern won't accept changes, then we can insert into Patina letter amended a clause which states the ENA will keep whole Patina for those obligations and liabilities.

I agree . . . if Kern remains stubborn, is there any short, sweet side agreement that could be drafted between ENA and Patina (maybe as an add-on to our letter agreement amendment) that would effectively pass through the pre-assignment liabilities?

I just received Chris Kennedy's marked up version.  I will forward immediately.

You can direct Kern that we are prepared to underpin that exposure such that Enron wears that risk.... as
 1. there should be no risk anyways, and 
2.  if there were to be any, it should be ENA's anyways.

I thought you understood from my email and phone call that I was going to track down El Paso's interpretation of the 24 hours recall rights.  Regulatory treatment of the 58 million by PG&E is a CPUC issue.  I just talked to Becky and I don't have a good response to the question of whether our capacity could replace expansion capacity in light of the dueling recall rights, but I will think about it and talk to Becky some more.

As to the 24-hour recall, I can only tell you what the FERC order says, I have no special knowledge of how El Paso and the parties intended the 24 recall to work.  The order is fairly terse, and just says "and if it so recalled (by PG&E), that Enron may further recall the capacity for its own use in the PG&E  service territory upon 24 hours notice."  The language says to me that you can recall it 24 hours before you want to use it.  However, I can call El Paso and find out how they interpret it.

As to the "traditional rate making" valuation of the $58 million, I have to confess I don't understand what you mean.  PG&E paid the 58 million as part of a negotiated settlement.  Typically that is part of a black box settlement, meaning that revenue dollars are not tracked to particular costs.  We can pull the settlement and see if it stipulates some sort of treatment, but I would doubt it.  If your question relates to how PG&E is tracking that expense in a regulatory sense, perhaps Jeff Dasovich can find out.

When is the 24 hour notice on re-recall effective - 24 hours from the day of recall (varies depending on term) or 24 hours before the recall is supposed to start?

How would you value what's left of the $58 million that PG&E paid based upon traditional rate making policies? I believe there are at least 5 years left on the term of the settlement.

Please call if you have any questions,

Regards,

Stephanie

I looked over all the orders and the contracts and I agree with both of your interpretation of the recall rights of Block II.  PG&E did not make a very smart deal for $58 million.

Concur Expense (XMS)
Common Questions


1.  Where can I find online documentation on Concur Expense?
Answer: Documentation on Concur Expense is stored in the ISC Document Library.   Go to the following link:
http://isc.enron.com/site/doclibrary/user/default.asp  and click on the XMS - Concur Expense folder on the left.

2. How can I sign up for Concur Expense training and how much does it cost?
Answer: Go to the following link: http://iscedcenter.enron.com/docentlm/login.htm.  Log in using your Enron email address.  Enter your birth date as the password in the following format: MMDDYYYY.  Under the Courses section, select Concur Expense (XMS).  This will show the training schedule.  Click the Enroll button to sign up for a class.  The cost is $250.

3. Will old XMS expense reports be converted to the new Concur Expense system?
Answer: No.  History data was not converted to the new system because of our move to an Application Service Provider (ASP) solution for Concur Expense.

4. How can I view my old expense reports?
Answer: Call the ISC Customer Care group at 713-345-4727.  The ISC will be responsible for printing out old expense reports and forwarding them to you.  Other options are being reviewed to allow you to view old expense reports.

5. Are there any Enron specific help instructions for Concur Expense?
Answer: Yes.  If you log into Concur Expense, you will see a link to Enron Help on the Concur Expense home page under the Company Links section.  Also you will see a button for Enron Help at the top of the screen when entering expense reports.

6. Is Enron's Travel Policy available in Concur Expense?
Answer: Yes. If you log into Concur Expense, you will see a link to Travel Policy on the Concur Expense home page under the Company Links section.  Also you will see a button for Travel Policy at the very top of the screen when entering expense reports

7. What if I am unable to see any of my credit card charges in Concur Expense?
Answer: Since there are a number of factors that could cause this problem, it is best to call the ISC Customer Care group first.  The ISC will research the problem and get back to you with an answer.

8. Does Concur Expense have a time-out feature?
Answer: Yes.  Concur Expense will automatically time out after 20 minutes of inactivity.

9. How do I enter foreign currency into Concur Expense?
Answer: Go to the ISC Document Library described in #1 above.  Go to the XMS - Concur Expense folder.  Next go to the Special Procedures folder and following the directions stated in the document called Add a Foreign Currency Expense to an Expense Report.

10. Are there any other sources to quickly get me started using Concur Expense?
Answer: Yes.  Concur Expense provides a Quick Tour for new users.  Log into Concur Expense and click the Help button in the top right corner of the screen.  Then click the button labeled Quick Tour at the top of the help screen.  The ISC intranet home page also contains some helpful information.  The following link summarizes some of the topics discussed above:  http://isc.dev.corp.enron.com/site/XMSchange.htm.

11. Can you quickly describe some of the internal changes in the new Concur Expense system?
Answer:  There are minimal changes in the new upgrade.  Here is a list:
?	The first screen only has one tab instead of two
?	New expense types were added
?	Attendees and approvers will now be printed on the expense reports
?	Manager and receipt dunning notices will be sent out
?	The statistical order and statistical WBS element fields have been separated out


Please direct all other questions to the ISC Customer Care group at 713-345-4727.

Barry,

It was a pleasure to discuss the upcoming gas supply needs of DWR and the
potential supply options that Enron may be able to provide . I am interested
in further exploring the discounted transportation/ supply program we
briefly discussed at this week's meeting. As for the payables, DWR is
following standard payment terms; the latter of 10 days after receipt of
invoice or the 25th of the month following delivery. DWR would not agree to
accelerating payments. Additionally, please be advised that DWR would be
contemplating relatively short term transactions with Enron at this time. If
you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call.

Mark Baldwin, IGS.

I filled in the utilities on our industrial customer list for WA & OR.  It looks like there are 17 major industrials behind Cascade (according to our list).  I would suggest we exclude these from the Agency agreement if we ever decide we want to go that direction.

Hello Barry,

My name is Todd Neugebauer and I am a manager in EBS Wholesale Origination in Europe.  I came over here as an associate in February and was promoted in June.  I am looking to move back into one of our more core areas and Ted Bland recommended I speak to you, or someone in your group.  If you have a need, I am going to be in Houston late next week and would be able to meet then to discuss any opportunities.

Steph:  Exactly what are you looking for - I'm not sure we could give you an opinion of the mechanics.  If you remember, we looked at this issue back in March and I sent you the e-mail message below.  Since then, FERC has issued orders in Docket No. RP00-241 on 3/28/2001 and 6/11/2001 which reaffirmed its rulings in the orders discussed below.  There is no discussion in any of the orders on the specific mechanics of the recall other than what I already noted, namely, if the capacity has been recalled by El Paso or a shipper to serve a PG&E market, and the original shipper wants it back, it can re-recall the recalled capacity on 24 hours notice as long as it is using all of its other Block II capacity.  If you need something more "legal", we'll see what we can do.  If we have to go to Bracewell for a law firm legal opinion, there would be a charge since they'd have to do the same research before they could sign off on one.

Subject:	Re: block II  

I would note also that the recent reallocation of Topock rights takes care of one of the issues -- namely that El Paso allowed Dynegy to take Block II capacity to SoCal Topock.  The 4/14/00 order should have taken care of it, except for El Paso's position that they had capacity at Topock in the aggregate so they weren't overselling it.  

Order Date	Block II Rulings	
6/14/2000 Denial of Rehearing by Operation of Law	Denies Indicated Shippers request for rehearing of 4/14/00 order.	
4/14/2000 Order on Rehearing (Enron)	Clarifies the January 19 order to provide that El Paso may remarket the PG&E turnback capacity, including Block II, for primary delivery to delivery points other than PG&E Topock if capacity is available at those other delivery points.	
1/19/2000 Order on Negotiated Rate Transactions  (Enron & Williams)	Block II capacity has primary delivery rights only at PG&E Topock and alternative rights at the other Topock delivery points. Rejects CPUC argument against the recall provisions, which are the same as ultimately accepted in the Dynegy deal (see 10/19/99, 7/29/99, 9/17/98 and 6/11/98 orders) and provide (1) that there is no right of recall if the Block II capacity is simply idle, (2) that the capacity may be recalled if it is being used to serve points other than those behind PG&E Topock, and (3) if so recalled, it may be recalled by the original shipper for its own use in the PG&E service territory upon 24 hours notice. Clarifies, as in Dynegy, that the shipper (Enron) must use all its other Block II capacity before recalling other Block II capacity, but is not required to use Block I or Block III capacity first.	
10/19/1999 Order on Rehearing and Clarification (Dynegy)	Denies rehearing of 7/29/99 order 	
7/29/1999 Order on Rehearing and Compliance Filing (Dynegy)	 Affirms that PG&E and the CPUC are entitled to have the Block II capacity recalled to northern California even if it is under contract [to Dynegy]. Reverses previous ruling -- does not require that all other capacity to California be utilized before Block II capacity can be recalled. Per Settlement, recalling shipper must pay max rate to recall if its contract is one month or less.  If for more than one month, the rate must equal or exceed the rate of the existing shipper. On 24 hours notice, the existing shipper (i.e., Dynegy) may recall for its own use to serve northern California markets, capacity that was recalled for use by other shippers, even if those shippers are willing to pay a higher rate. Clarifies that if the Block II capacity is idle but is not being used to serve areas outside of northern California, [Dynegy] may hold the capacity without any obligation to release it.	
9/17/1998 Letter Order on Compliance Filing	Requires the Dynegy/El Paso agreement to clearly state that Block II capacity was recallable even though Dynegy had a minimum take requirement. Requires El Paso to eliminate use of alternative delivery points as the defining point for the service that would be recalled -- issue is markets served, not delivery points. Requires elimination of a clause requiring recalling shipper to submit a sworn statement that no capacity was available on other pipelines.	
6/11/1998 	Shippers in northern California cannot recall Block II capacity simply because it is not actually being used by [Dynegy]. Block II is recallable if [Dynegy] is using it to serve end users not within PG&E's service territory. Shippers who want to recall Block II capacity must have an actual need and may only recall if firm capacity is not available to PG&E's service territory via El Paso or via any other pipeline available to the shipper.

Subject:	Block III Recall Rights

Further to our discussions about our EPNG capacity: 

Our research had resulted in an opinion that there is little value associated with PG&E's (northern CA customers) recall rights on Block III capacity.  While it was not part of the original settlement, the 24 hour RE-recall rights to the shipper of record appear to give PG&E a DAILY call on capacity at best. 

Because we have pieced this opinion together based upon rulings in various proceedings, we would like a more formal regulatory/legal opinion of the mechanics of the RE-recall provision that has been developed over time. Is this something that either of you can provide or should it go to Randy? The results of this inquiry will set the tone of our next round of dicussions with EPNG.

 By the way, still waiting on their written reponse to our letter..... I think they have bigger fish to fry.

Please advise.

Stephanie

Yes.  See attached.  Note that even the Commission decision overturning the ALJ's rejection of roll-in dates back to early 1999.  The 1999 Policy Statement was not issued until September 1999. 


     Procedural History

          This proceeding arises from two general section 4 rate cases
     filed by Transco in Docket Nos. RP95-197-000 and RP97-71-000. 
     Those cases have a long and complicated history which need not be
     repeated here.4/  A controversial issue in these proceedings has
     been whether the costs of Transco's twelve incrementally-priced
     Leidy and Southern expansion projects should be rolled into
     Transco's system-wide rates.   

           On April 16, 1999, the Commission issued an order5/
     reversing the ALJ's rejection of Transco's proposal to roll in
     the costs of the twelve projects.  The Commission held that, in
     determining whether Transco and the proponents of rolled-in rates
     had met their section 4 burden, the Commission would apply its
     1995 Pricing Policy Statement, 6/ which was issued one year after
     the last of the projects at issue here was certificated and
     built.  The Commission concluded that Transco had satisfied the
     conditions in the 1995 Pricing Policy Statement for rolling in
     expansion costs.

Subject:	RE: PGT Fuel Treatment

Stephanie:  Confirming our phone conversation today, based on my reading of the Transco order and the PGT order, the FERC relied on a different standard in the Transco case (the 1995 Pricing Policy Statement) than they used in the PGT case (the 1999 Policy Statement on Certification of New Interstate Natural Gas Pipeline Facilities).  

The 1995 Policy Statement said that, when the roll-in increased rates to existing shippers by less than 5%, the pipeline needed to make only a general showing of system benefits, and FERC said that Transco had satisfied that showing.  

The 1999 Policy Statement, however, has a threshold requirement for expansion projects requiring that there can be no subsidization from existing customers - in other words, no increase in costs of any kind.  The PGT order found that there was a possibility that fuel costs could increase for existing shippers; therefore, PGT had to establish a surcharge mechanism to subject expansion shippers to an incremental fuel charge for fuel costs above those that would apply absent the new compression.  If the fuel costs do not increase, then there will be no surcharge.

Subject:	PGT Fuel Treatment

Greetings Becky:

Met with PGT the other day. Based upon a recent FERC ruling on the treatment of fuel on a project on Transco's Leidy Lateral (last 2 weeks), PGT is going to ask FERC to reverse its ruling on the 2002 expansion. If you remember, FERC was very clear on the notion that existing shippers should not subsidize increased costs associated with incremental shippers. I've been told that Transco received approval for rolled in treatment of higher fuel because they did not have an "incremental" tariff.  

This sounds very suspicious - can you please investigate?

Thanks,

Stephanie

The rest will be completed shortly.

We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans "Re-start/Integration"  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually.

I can make time.  Let's try to let Leslie vacation.  Also, I'm having a memo prepared that should be ready first thing Monday AM on the CA Commission's policies regarding utility use of hedging instruments.  Just let me know when you'd like to talk.

Best,

Hi Dave,

As we've been running our numbers on this proposal, I was curious if your
offer of $13MM factors in any kind of tax make-up for the up-front payment?
I'm continuing to try to identify where we have differences in value so we
can discuss further tomorrow.  By the way, I think there will be 3 to 4 of
us tomorrow:

Myself
Tim Miller - Origination (Southwest)
Bill Burden - Business Development Gas and Power
Kim Colburn - Business Development Gas and Power

Give me a call and we can set up a place to meet in front of the restaurant
- they won't seat anyone until everyone is there anyway.

Penny,

We do not have a hard deadline for placing this capacity, however, some
of it has already been spoken for.   We could do something as early as
Nov 01 but I understand that may be a bit aggressive.  Our offer
currently stands at about $13MM for 100,000/day, Nov 01 - May 06.  We
will look to you to take on the obligation for that payment or make us a
counter offer.  We would be happy to sit down with you as early as next
week to work through any questions or issues.  I hope that answers your
question, please let me know if it doesn't.

Dave

PS - I'll be in Houston next week if a meeting would be useful.

Dave,

Just wanted to clarify what kind of deadline your aiming for with this
transport proposal.  The reason I am asking is I have taken this to the
next
level and we will probably need several days to run through our internal
processes.  I know you are working with multiple parties so if you let
me
know how you would like to proceed then we can be working on a similar
timeline.

Hey Penny,

One more thought on the EPNG capacity valuation we've been discussing...
physical gas in the San Juan is selling at a discount to index,
therefore we are incorporating that into our valuation.  I thought you
might want to consider that as well. 

Thanks,

Following is a suggested order of events:

1) Contact customer to float concept. If they are interested in a termination, present an initial suggested number. If they are interested in an assignment to a third party, ask for their permission to discuss their deals with other companies, such as Duke and Williams. It is preferred to do a simple termination to the assignment

2) Ask Melissa Murphy (31886) for a list of transactions, the MTM values and copies of the confirms associated with them. Ensure the values represent today's MTM

3) Show the transaction list and valuations to the gas and power traders responsible for those delivery points. Ask them to initial the MTM values and the volumes. Ensure they understand that terminating the deals will make them longer/shorter at each location and obtain their approval to proceed with doing so.

4) Contact customer with the fresh MTM number and obtain final verbal agreement.

5) Work with Jim Meyn/Leonardo Pacheco to put together final contract, complete with copies of the terminated confirms.

6) Bring the final contract to Dave Forster for final signature/approval.

7) Ensure full contract execution ASAP. Chase counterparty as necessary.

Subject:	LADWP Gas Contract


Dear Potential Gas Supplier

As some of you may know our authority to buy gas off our existing spot agreement
will come to an end on December 31, 2001.  While we will honor current
commitments for gas to be delivered after that date, but we will not be able to
use the spot agreement to buy any more gas.  The reason that this is happening
is that our City Attorney has interpreted the new City Charter as not allowing
delegations of authority such as employed in the way we buy gas now.

We are seeking approval for an ordinance which must be approved by the City
Council that will restore our former ability to buy gas with the kind of
agreement most gas suppliers are familiar.  We have the ordinance approved by
the City Attorney and it will shortly be in the pipeline for approval by our
Board and the City Council, but until then, this contract is a stop gap to keep
us operating.

I've attached the new contract and a cover letter which explains what we are
doing.  The deadline is November 8, 2001 at 4:00 PM.  We will take the executed
contracts to our Board with the counterparties listed on a Board Resolution and,
if it is approved, we will be allowed to buy gas from this group after the new
year begins.  This is not the ideal contract but one we feel our Board will be
comfortable with until we can get around the Charter problem.  I can't make any
changes to this contract.  There is a notice published in the LA Times about the
availability of the contract but I am sending it to you directly as someone we
have already done business with (and undoubtedly have satisfied all our
boilerplate requirements) and will probably be interested in what we are trying
to do here.

I Hope most of you will respond.  Thanks

I see how you are doing this.  You are using some early estimates of fuel I
gave you.  You know you should not trust me.  We have some better numbers
now.  It turns out that our average fuel usage rate for calendar 2000 was
.0044 % per pipeline mile.  Stretching this out over 612 miles, KG to Malin
yields a rate of 2.69%.  This is just one place to start when examining the
impact of the expansion.  The modeling of the expansion yields an
incremental rate for the 200,000 mcfd of 7.46%.  If you combine those on a
weighted average you will get 3.24%.  The quantities at KG are significantly
higher than in your estimate.  Regardless, these are the numbers we are
currently predicting.  The actuals will be different and perhaps lower as
the operators optimize the system performance.  Who knows.  Also we are
predicting that the pipeline looping will be constructed in advance and put
into service ahead of the compression.  So on a long term basis (like the
first year) the fuel rate will decrease due to the  looping.

I had promised that I would send my fuel calculation over! Please check on
this:

Current fuel (king to malin) = 2,200,000 mmbtu/d*.03 = 66,000 mmbtu

Proposed fuel = 2,400,000 mmbtu/d*.036 = 86,400 mmbtu

Difference = 20,400/200,000 incremental capacity = 10.2%

Please advise!!

Greetings Becky 

Wanted to make sure we protested the filing based on fuel treatment - page 10 description.  You and I have talked about their interpretation of the Transco ruling - we need to reinforce the currently effective FERC policy of incremental treatment for projects that would raise rates/fuel for existing shippers, regardless of their claim that their tariff does not provide for an incremental fuel charge.

I believe Newport Generation tried to get the previous incremental fuel ruling for the 2002 expansion overturned - they were unsuccessful. FERC's answer to that request may provide good language to cite...... 

What is the timeline?

Barry,
No, I didn't receive this before. Regarding the plan for us to build credit
by selling day gas, yes, a bit more detail on the mechanics would help. Any
trading with Enron would have to be approved by my management. Regarding El
Paso, Gas Procurement needs to see what the utility's plan of reorganization
is before we can look at that seriously. The plan is due Dec 6 at the
latest. I have a call in to Eric LeDain regarding the Canadian contract, so
we should be getting to that soon.

Assume K demand of 24,500

24,500*4.2%= 1,029 mmbtu

24,500+1,025 = 25,529 mmbtu

25,529 *95.8% = 24,457 SHORT GAS!


Correct method:

24,500/95.8% = 25,574 mmbtu

25,574 * 95.8% = 24,500 mmbtu - BINGO!

Jim:

As we have discussed, ENA is trying to close a gas supply transaction with Citizens Gas in Arizona to provide gas supply to Citizens for ultimate delivery to PP&L for the Griffith power plant.  As part of this transaction, Enron Asset Management Resources (EAMR) would provide services to operate a pipeline that interconnects El Paso and Transwestern to the pipeline header system that ultimately interconnects with the Griffith power plant. To date, it has been the reasonable position of EAMR that its liability for services provided to Citizens should be "capped" at the sum of its annual fee of $144,000.  Citizens wants a $1,000,000 limit.  Citizens and EAMR have agreed to all aspects of the services deal except this liability question.  Although it might be possible to close our gas deal without EAMR, this is far from certain.  I have been trying to come up with an approach that would bridge this gap so that the ENA gas deal can be closed. 

This e-mail is intended to indicate the value of this transaction to Enron and get your viewpoint as to the feasibility and cost of one of two deal structures:

1)  ENA buys insurance to cover the cost of our buying a policy to bridge th gap in liability from $144,000 to $1,000,000.
2)  EAMR decides to increase the laibiltiy to $1,000,000 in return for increasing their earnings on the deal by the amount ENA would pay fior the insurance product - about $120,000.

ENA's preference is clearly for approach 2.

The attached spreadsheet indicates the value of this transaction to Enron.  ENA will earn approximately $3 million on the deal.  Please keep this number in confidence.  In addition, we have budgeted about $120,000 for the insurance product to increase the liability of EAMR from $140,000 to $1,000,000.

Can you please advise me as to the feasibility of 1) or 2) above?  If there is no way we are going to get there, I need to know fairly quickly so I can explore other options.  If it is possible, which of the above 2 approaches is better from you perspective?

Citizens will be here today at 3:00 pm.  I would greatly appreciate some feedback from you by that time.

To contact me please call Kim Ward at 713/853-0685 and she will be able to find me.

Thanks very much for you time.

Chris

Mike, here is a very brief overview of planned or approved expansions by major pipeline.  There is a lot of detail that supports each of these pipe expansions including, proposed start dates, delivery points, probability etc... 

Let's discuss needs... 

Perhaps, we can give your group a general overview on expansions in the west, current status etc.

Energy West has been covered by the Canadian Desk for the last 5 years..... I think dave priced a 10 year deal lower than what Canada had already priced the deal at... so we have two issues, 1.  coverage (ownership), 2. coordination efforts.

No, canada is not part of the union but at times the thinkness of the 49th parallel ocelates.

Eric, I received your message on discussions with Energy West.  Firstly, I was unaware of any pricing discussions or notional prices being put out to the customer and I have not discussed with Dave, or Mark Whitt. With that being said, I am sure Dave is out marketing products and services to all of the Utilities in the PNW. 

With out a doubt, we need to discuss this effort as it relates to and creates conflict or duplicate coverage.. I look forward to the discussion and did try to call you earlier today to discuss directly.

Barry,

Definately give a call before you come to LA. Either "the girls" can show
you arond or I can definately give you some good info. You can reach me at
310-372-3086.

I also dropped "Ceasar" a note but haven't heard back from him. Did he make
it back alive from Cabo or did a big fish pull him under?

Later,

Debra

Attached is a summary of the conference call held between Enron, Citizens, and PP&L on October 18th.  Proposed procedures on how we will handle cuts from now on are also included.  Enron is making every effort available to ensure that PP&L receives 100% of the gas that they call on.  I feel that we need to formally agree to these procedures, either in the form of an amendment to the agreement or a formal letter signed by all parties.

Please let me know if you have any comments regarding these procedures and how you would like to proceed.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

There may be a handful of small QFs which have not returned but I would say the a majority of the QFs are back on line and are being paid for what they generate on a go forward basis.  Right now the SCE QFs are negotiating with SCE on 2 major points:  when will they be paid for the outstanding receivables (est. at $1.3 B for SCE and about $1.0 B for PG&E)  and when will the 5 yr fixed price SRAC of 5.37 cents/kw apply for those that have selected this option.  Right now SCE appears to be indicating that they will be paying the receivable sometime around June/July of 2002 and that the 5.37 price would apply at that time or as much as 4 months after that.  The logic is that they are trying to indicate that the MOU, if it had been passed, would not have applied at least until that time.

Mike, have the QF's been paid for the power they were selling to the utilities.  I have not heard much about that and was wondering if these payments were all part of the Bond issue.? Are the QF's generating power today?

Please find the attached LOI.  See if it meets with your understanding of the deal.  The document is non-binding but will serve as a framework for the actual agreements.  I will send you draft versions of the other documents on Monday.

Mark can do, but as general proposition I think tht you can assume that none of the changes to the Canadian form have been made to the US form, some of which will be jurisdictional to Canada and others of which will not.  Mark please prepare a brief summary.

If one of the exercises is to standardize ( as best as possible the two agreements) I think we need to create a document that identifies the variance in the agreements. Has this been done and if so, can I have a copy to review. I have gone through both the US and Canadian agreements but am not sure where some of the subtle differences lie.

Call if you want to discuss.

We have 200,000 mmbtu/day of "Block II" capacity available through May 31, 2006. It is labeled "Block II" because PG&E owns recall rights on the entire block through 12/31/2005.  The ROFR rights that go with this capacity add a tremendous amount of value (i.e. market rates with short term commitment vs. 15 - 20 year obligation of new build)

Capacity currently has access to all supply basins. However, the current FERC proceedings on receipt point reallocations will probably result in a supply split of 60% San Juan and 40% Permian. 

Rates for the capacity and my Duke proposal are attached.

Please call if you have any questions.

At Peter's request, please find attached a copy of the most recent draft of the PG&E Master as compared to the modified version forwarded to us by PG&E in May.  The document also has my comments as to the reasons for some of the key changes.  Those comments are in red (so it might be easier to read the document on line).

Sharon will be coordinating a meeting to discuss the document in advance of our anticipated meeting with PG&E (which I believe is expected to occur on next Tuesday).

In the meantime, if you have any questions, please give me a call (6708).

This was forwarded to me by Paul Kaufman 

Today's GD reports that the Colorado PUC is seeking public comments on policy changes necessary to provide price stability for customers.  The article states that the PUC is seeking comments on 3 methods:  (1) requiring utilities to hedge more of their gas supply; (2) requiring utilities to offer an optional service that would be less volatile than standard offer service; and (3) implementing gas unbundling to give customers supplier choice. 

Apparently, the Commission has received comments from the state's LDCs (and maybe others, although the article didn't speak to them).  It is asking for another round of comments, which are due June 18th.

I recommend that we file comments which advocate our hedging proposal, including weather products.

Subject:	Kern River 637 Segmentation Issue

Report from yesterday's technical conference.  FYI, Kern River originally argued that there is no viable segmentation opportunity on its system because there are currently no gas supply sources available to its shippers between the Utah and Nevada markets to source a segmented transport.  After a technical conference last October, Kern River did file a segmentation proposal, but I'm not sure how much value it would have as a practical matter.  Note the Southwest Gas arguments (summarized in #3 below) for allowing backhauls from California to Las Vegas under a segmented agreement.

Subject:	Kern River 637 Segmentation Issue

Becky,

I did attend this morning's Kern River technical conference in Docket No. RP00-337 at FERC.  The discussion was only on the segmentation proposal made by Kern River.  They have filed pro forma tariff sheets to allow:
segmenting of firm contracts at any point
segmentation and release
subject to a limitation of MD at any overlapping points
backhaul from supply pooling points or points where gas is physically received
sets out secondary priorities for transportation within the path and outside the path

After Kern River made this pro forma filing, there were two protests by Dynegy and Southwest Gas.  Kern River discussed these protests at this technical conference in attempt to resolve all issues.

1.  Kern River agreed with Dynegy's point that a segmenting shipper should retain primary rights to mainline capacity when using points within the original contract path or even when outside of path but the mainline constraint remains the same as within the path.

However, after determining priorities on mainline capacity, if constraints occur at specific new points in the segmented transaction, then the transaction could be given secondary priority based on the receipt or delivery point capacity.

Indicated Shippers needed to be assured that their capacity to Wheeler would not be diminished due to this new policy.  Kern River responded that this is how they have always treated flex points and that because Wheeler was a constrained point, any segmented transactions that used Wheeler (new) would be secondary to the current rights (not on the basis of mainline but on the basis of the delivery point scheduling).

2.  In response to Southwest's first issue, Kern River also agreed to make changes to provide parity between segmentation for release and segmentation for a shipper's own use of transportation.  If a shipper segments a contract, it can get additional primary receipt or delivery point capacity within the path if it is available from the pipeline.

It was also noted that a shipper can segment a contract that goes from A to C into two transactions - A to B and then a backhaul from C to B.  In doing this, since there is no overlapping of mainline capacity, both transactions can be at the original MDQ.  The result could be double the MDQ at the new delivery point B.  This seems very flexible of Kern River and perhaps more than many other pipelines currently are willing to offer.  

3.  The last issue raised by Southwest was the controversial one and was not resolved at today's technical conference.  Southwest wants to use its firm transportation contract on Kern River through segmenting to backhaul from Wheeler Ridge delivery point or from PG&E delivery point to Las Vegas.  Kern River currently will provide this kind of service only on a IT basis - a separate service to Southwest.  They claim that this cannot be provided on a firm basis.  Southwest states that this is displacement service and barring insufficient deliveries at Wheeler or PG&E (very unlikely, according to Southwest), could be provided under their firm contract.  They are willing to take the risk that the capacity would not be available if Kern does not have enough forward haul to Wheeler or PG&E.

Indicated Shippers claimed that this is similar to a service provided by Transwestern; however Transwestern offered this as a pipeline firm service.  Kern River claims that it does not and cannot offer this backhaul as a firm service.  Kern River also argued that per GISB once gas is scheduled on a firm contract to a secondary point that it is considered firm.  IT can be bumped intraday and this backhaul service may be bumped.

Mirant also supported Southwest on this issue because they know of some power plants in the Las Vegas area being built that could use this kind of service.

Kern River maintained that this service is not required by Order No. 637.

Kern River will file changes to the pro forma tariff by May 15.  Comments by the parties are due June 1 and Kern River can file in reply by June 11.  Comments should be emailed to the parties.

Grant, ENE trades at 7x 2001 expected recurring earnings and 0.9 times book value.  This is far lower than a quick industry average of 15.5 times 2001 expected earnings and 2.8 times current book value (industry includes Duke, EL Paso, Williams, Dynegy, Kinder Morgan, and Aquila).  I think what these ratios demonstrate is the risk of the unknown that is being priced into ENE.  For example the current price to book seems like a suspect ratio to use for ENE given that it is unclear what is on our books and what else needs to be written down.  If you look at ENE on a price to earnings after non-recurring items for 2001 it looks far less attractive at 22.9 times.  If you take ENE's earnings after "non-recurring" items and slap on the industry average multiple of 15.5 times ENE's share price is $8.51 (ouch).  Now obviously not everything in the non-recurring events are actually recurring but there is talk of some wholesale losses being buried in the "non-recurring" loss.

ENE's long-term debt to equity is 0.9 times but if you include all the off balance sheet leverage and the leverage inherent in our trading business the true number is significantly higher than 0.9 times.  On a positive note the ENE's debt is trading higher today (price not yield).

Here is a spreadsheet from Bloomberg with the S&P pipelines sub sector P/Es, and P/Bs. and dividend per share (ENE's is 4%, nothing like a share price falling by 85% to get that div yield up).  I have also attached the latest Wall Street Journal article touting Berkshire, Royal Dutch, and GE as potential suitors (do you think Buffet can understand ENE?).

Hope this helps
--Derek

John,
As we discussed, our attorney, Gerald Nemec, will incorporate your language from the red-lined Assignment Agreement in an amendment to the existing letter agreement between ENA and Patina.  The amendment to the letter agreement should be completed this afternoon, at which time Gerald will e-mail you a copy for review.

To the extent that the language is agreeable, Patina can execute Kern's original Assignment Agreement and the amendment to the letter agreement concurrently.

Please call myself or Gerald Nemec (713-853-3512) if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Tyrell Harrison

Timely note, and once again I am already hard at work prospecting for you up here.
They are getting ready to drill CBM this fall. I've been meeting with them on this and actually set them up to do a deal with ATS on production/revenue/lease acctg in the US (next mtg Oct 9 in Calgary).  I gave them a presentation a few weeks ago on the general things we and ATS can do for them in Denver/Dallas.  I want to send them something more specific about all we can do in the Rockies on the gas mktg side.  I'll also build in some data on Hanover for them so will draw that from Producer One.
Can I get some general slides about all the good things Mark and the gang do in Denver.
Timing is next few days.  I'd like to get this to them by sometime Friday if possible (not the end of the world if it's early next week). 
Thanks.

Sorry for the delay, but I finally have a revised version of your contract from our legal department.  Although we have made what appear to be substantial revisions, I believe the key aspects of the agreement remain intact and the revised contract adheres to industry standards.

Hi Barry,

I have sent to you in the mail an article regarding the situation with your
stock account at TD.  Our best advice is to probably close out the account
per TD and do online trading, if that suits you, or move the funds to the
US.

Re the cottage in Riding Mountain - go ahead.  Two things:  it isn't
useable in the winter, so it's not available for your use and the second
thing is that you are going to be purchasing it AFTER you've become a
non-resident.

Amex Card - probably isn't a huge issue to use the Canadian one, but it is
a tie.

Please call with any further enquiries or for clarification.

Boys,  
I am bored today and have proof to show you... 
Go to this website and type in 1031 in the sale number field..
It's a beauty and would be a fine addition to any collector's gallery.
I would consider a joint venture with you for investment purposes on this
find of a lifetime.
Personally, I think it looks a little like a late 70's drummer but it is the
Great One nonetheless. 
It is a fine specimen of the era ' Short on the sides, but keep the length
in the back'

PS- the price is about 25,000 swedish kroners which i think is about $5000

El Paso recently filed their proposal to reallocate receipt point capacity. Comments are due on Thursday, May 17, 2001.

We would like to meet with you to make sure our comments address the commercial concerns regarding the reallocation plan. In that regard, please plan to attend a meeting on Thursday, May 3 at 3:45 in 3269.  Becky will provide for your review a summary of El Paso's proposal.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks

As we discussed during our September 7 meeting, attached is a matrix
showing the 10 Northwest Aluminum Direct Service Industries (DSI's).
Since the curtailment agreements BPA has with Alcoa and Columbia Falls
are confidential, am not privy to all their terms. However, I think the
overall status is pretty accurate.

We can use this chart in our October 8 meeting to discuss possible DSI
candidates for Enron services. Please let me know if you need any more
information.

Barry,
Take a look at this Version II of the Pricing Sheet.  Let me know what you think.  Also, I was unclear on your comments about the NYMEX chart - were you wanting me to add historicals?

Attached is the draft of ENA/EES comments to be filed Thursday in the proceeding on the complaint filed by various producers, the CPUC, SoCal Gas, and SoCal Edison against El Paso Natural Gas, alleging that El Paso has oversold its system and that full requirements contracts should be converted to CD.  Our comments agree with the complainants, illustrated by EES experiences with Southwest Gas this past winter.

If you have any comments or questions about this filing, please let me or Leslie know by close of business (5:00 pm CDT) tomorrow.

I have had several conversations with EPNG about the possibility of ENA turning back capacity to satisfy 1) requests for new capacity in the Power Up 2000 project and 2) any possible capacity that EPNG may need to provide to satisfy incremental needs of full requirements customers as they convert billing determinants to Contract Demand quantities.

In order to preserve our position, should I send a formal letter to Al Clark stating our desire to turn the capacity back? The Power Up 2000 deadline is noon, Thursday, August 2, 2001. They did not provide for turn back in the posting that is currently on the capacity system. While we do not know how EPNG will be forced to resolve their capacity issues in the receipt point allocation proceeding, I believe that a letter can help us preserve our position should we choose to turn back capacity under either scenario.

We have approx. 54,000 of Block I and III capacity and 200,000 of Block III capacity. The Block II capacity is subject to PG&E recall - PG&E paid approx. $58 million for those recall rights in a settlement. Could EPNG pay a negotiated sum of money for the remaining value of the recall rights to fund the needs full requirement customers? I have to believe this option would be cheaper than adding new  capacity.

Leslie - could you help me with the letter?

Many thanks!

Stephanie

Below are some examples of storage services that AEC Storage & Hub Services
can provide at the AECO Storage Facilities located in Alberta.  I priced out
a profile based on our conversation this morning where you indicated that
typically Sierra Pacific usually required a greater withdrawal rate then
injection rate.  I also selected an inventory capacity of 500,000 GJ
(Approximately 0.5 BCF), although I can price out the AECO storage at
utilizing different Withdrawal/Injection rates as well as different
Capacities if you desire.

Proposal #1 (10 Month)
Contract Profile: Standard Profile where Withdrawal/Injection rates are tied
to daily inventory levels, see table below for rate details.
Term: June 2001 to March 31, 2002
Capacity: 500,000 GJ
Withdrawal Rate: 20,000 GJ/d
Injection Rate: 14,000 GJ/d
Demand Cost: CAD 49,844 per month
Commodity: CAD 0.18/GJ on injection only

Proposal #2 (34 Month)
Contract Profile: Standard Profile where Withdrawal/Injection rates are tied
to daily inventory levels, see table below for rate details.
Term: June 2001 to March 31, 2004
Capacity: 500,000 GJ
Withdrawal Rate: 20,000 GJ/d
Injection Rate: 14,000 GJ/d
Demand Cost: CAD 44,860 per month
Commodity: CAD 0.18/GJ on injection only

The following table illustrates the Withdrawal/Injection rate profiles as it
relates to inventory for Proposals #1 &#2.

	MAX	MAX
	WITHDRAWAL	INJECTION
INVENTORY	RATE	RATE
(PJ)	(TJ/D)	(TJ/D)
0.00	10.0	14.0
0.05	12.0	14.0
0.10	14.0	14.0
0.13	15.0	14.0
0.15	16.0	14.0
0.18	17.0	14.0
0.20	18.0	14.0
0.25	20.0	14.0
0.30	20.0	12.6
0.35	20.0	11.2
0.38	20.0	10.5
0.40	20.0	9.8
0.45	20.0	8.4
0.50	20.0	7.0


Proposals #3 &#4 are based on Flat profiles for Withdrawal & Injection
regardless of your Inventory position.  These proposals provide maximum
flexibility.

Proposal #3 (10 Month)
Contract Profile: Flat
Term: June 2001 to March 31, 2002
Capacity: 500,000 GJ
Withdrawal Rate: 20,000 GJ/d
Injection Rate: 14,000 GJ/d
Demand Cost: CAD 85,882 per month
Commodity: CAD 0.18/GJ on injection only

Proposal #4 (34 Month)
Contract Profile: Flat
Term: June 2001 to March 31, 2004
Capacity: 500,000 GJ
Withdrawal Rate: 20,000 GJ/d
Injection Rate: 14,000 GJ/d
Demand Cost: CAD 81,182 per month
Commodity: CAD 0.18/GJ on injection only

Please review the above proposals and call me when you have had time to look
them over.  Additional please note that all the prices I quote above are
negotiable.  If you have any other profiles you would like priced please
give me a call and I'll get them priced out ASAP.

Thank you,

Judy, you were assigned to my U.S and Canadian  tax returns. I am a
employee of Enron North America and previously was an  employee of Enron
Canada in Calgary.

As we had discussed at the time of my filing, I was  never given any
advise
on my relocation to the U.S. regarding tax issues, As  such I am not
sure
what some of my next moves should be. I very much  require some
assistance regarding spousal employment. My wife is a  registered nurse
and
would like to work in the U.S., but I have been advised  that this may
affect my filing in the U.S. and perhaps could cost me more in  U.S.
Taxes.

Can we set up a meeting to discuss strategies on  making sure I am going
about this properly.

This is my home e-mail address, you can contact me  here or at my work
address, Barry.Tycholiz@enron.com.

Thanks in advance.

Barry and Kim,

Attached is my first go at our European option model.  It is capable of valuing monthly physical or financial calls/puts.  I've tried to make it user friendly by using a similar format as we are using for our swap/spread models.  Please let me know if you like its functionality, and provide me some input on how you might want to fiddle with it when doing real time pricing.

Phil

Dave,

I faxed the signed contract to Annette Willis, who assured me that
everything will work out.  She is much easier to work with than Roger
Reynolds, who we never want to do business with again.

Thanks for your help.

Don,

Attached is a request for a gas proposal for a retail customer in California.  Now that Roger Ponce is gone, and I am unable to get in touch with Derick Kelley, I no longer have a contact at EES to send these potential customers to.  Can you tell me who is handling retail customers in the West, particularly California?

Thanks,

Barry,

I would rather not get into the habit of locking in curves before the deal is officially closed (signed).  Can we just agree on a sharing policy, so that we may avoid the event underlined below.  I would like to consider the curves floating until it is booked.  We are all sharing the risk of Huber not signing.

Thanks,
Mike

Further to our conversation please find attached the curves on the JM Huber transaction that we have agreed to work off of. The 30,000/day of capacity will sit on the books until next week but the deal with HUBER is effectively completed. In the event that this deal does not close, then the West desk will resume with the same MTM risks that you presently have.  

Any curve shift positive from now until the transaction is actually unwound will be credited back to the orig desk and any negative curve shift from here on in will be credited to the trading desk... plus ENA Orig and trading will work on a sharing calculation payable for any future deals. 

In addition to the transportation income being generated, additional orig will be generated by entering into wellhead and market based transactions with the desks. I believe that all of the risks and discussions associated with the structures have been well communicated with each book ( by Mark Whitt ) and we will be meeting with each of you early next week to get the structures and booking set up properly.

I trust that this note covers the general areas related to this deal and I am very pleased with the high level of cooperation shown by everyone..

Pls review file and if there are any questions give me a call.

BT

Barry

Thanks for taking time Friday to meet with us......Sorry I missed you but I agree the meeting did go well.....I think you were successful in helping Michael Lynch over his hurdle concerning transport and gas supply which you rightfully point out are two distinct and separate issues.

I appreciate Stephanie Millers role in assisting our group in identifying obstacles and solutions in our development effort.  I hope you are not thinking of redirecting her.  She works well with our group.

With regard to Longview, lets coordinate the Gas Services Agreements through our development group.  I would prefer not to send McCook any further documentation until they have responded to our PSA and Management Agreements.  McCook is good at making us work and never responding. They owe us some Good Faith if you know what I mean.

I would appreciate it if you would continue to respond to McCooks questions about transport and supply...It sould like they need to get into an open season at the right time and you have a much better feel for that timing that I do.

Regards,
Jake

Jake, sorry I missed you on Friday. I took off around 4:00 and assumed you were tied up with MCCook.  If you have time today, give me a call.

If there is any chance that these guys are going to buy the plant, then they really need to get into the open seasons with Williams and PGT.... timing is everything. 

I also would like to discuss Stephanie Millers future role in the development game and would like your direct feedback. 

Thanks for having us at the meeting, I thought it went OK, but there really were two seperate agenda's and they were as much concerned about the price of their gas as they were interested in how it is going to get to the plant... and as you know, one doesn't really have to do with the other.

Attached are comments which ENA proposes to file in response to FERC's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking establishing the right for releasing shippers to recall released capacity from the replacement shipper for nomination at each of the first three GISB prescribed nomination deadlines.  The comments support the NOPR except that we say the FERC should make it absolutely clear that the intraday recall right must be part of a specific and express agreement between the releasing and replacement shipper, and that FERC should schedule a workshop after issuing the order so that operational concerns, such as accounting and gas tracking issues, can be worked out.

Comments must be filed by Monday, so please let me know if you have any concerns or suggestions by noon CST on Friday, 11/16.  Thanks.

Attached is a summary of my notes at the Socal meeting regarding revised window procedures.  No hand-outs were provided.

Calculation of Receipt Point Capacity
Topock  540 mmcf/d
Ehrenberg 1250 mmcf/d
Needles 800 mmcf/d
Wheeler 800 mmcf/d

New Receipt Points
Kramer Junction 200 mmcf/d
Hector Rd 50 mmcf/d
Both will be available around Feb 1

Basis of Pro-Ration-Current Windows Calculation
Currently, Gas Control provides total receipt point capacity comprised of demand forecast and injection capability and compares to maximum amount of gas that can enter system.  Gas Select prorates interstate's receipt capacity based on prior day's nominations.

New Calculation, Changes and Display
Based on operational maximum with adjustments for maintenance.  SoCal ist aking and applying the current formula for Wheeler Ridge to all the points.  Any changes to operational maximum will probably be due to maintenance and posted on Gas Select.  Customer will choose which points it wants to reduce receipts.  Operating maximums will equal demand forecast plus injections.  Demand forecast will rely on Gas Control weather forecast.  They use Weather Bank as one of their tools.

OFO Declaration
Name changes from overnomination
Can declare before any Cycle
Provide 2 hour notice
Post on Gas Select
Show OFO Calculation on Gas Select

Windows
Reason to set windows was to set limits to prevent too much gas from coming into system
Calculation based on noms which does not work well.  Lots of complaints.   People were complaining that it restricted access to the system.  Eliminating point specific calculation.  Open system to Max Oper. Limits or Contractual Limits.   Will continue to operate Wheeler Ridge under Aug 1 procedures.  No changes to Wheeler Ridge.   
Due to the need to maintain operational control, an OFO will be declared when scheduled volumes are greater than the max operating capacity on any cycle.  
Replace windows with operational maximum volumes.  If  CPUC approves comprehensive settlement, will post 5 days of information to anticipate OFO's
Now customers will elect which point they will back off instead of using windows.

Scheduling Changes-Nov 1
Gas Select is being rebuilt and will be an internet system in mid-2002 .  No direct dial-up.     
Rollover noms-noms will be copied from cycle to cycle
Copy confirmed noms
All noms will be rolled over-will not be at discretion of 3rd party.  However, can still make  changes.  Can still upload new files.

2 Hour Notice
Socal will provide 2 hour notice on  Gas Select of OFO.  Other methods include leaving message on Socal Hotline (213-244-3900) and list of e-mail messages that can go directly to pagers.  Gas Select is official notification.  Courtesy notification is hot line and e mail.  Gas Select is a subscriber- based system mandated by CPUC and must get regulatory change to make free.
OFO's are going to be system wide and not customer specific.  OFO's can be declared intraday.  Once OFO declared, it will be kept for entire day.  Concerned that if call off, will have to put back on.  Don't want to go back and forth.  This decision may be reconsidered once they see how it works.  Many times Socal see an increase of 200 mmcf/day between Cycle 3 and 4 so they are concerned.  

Scheduled vs. Capacity-Declare OFO
Nominations may not exceed 110% of expected usage.  
Expected Usage is defined as usage for the same day for the prior week.  Can revise expected usage.
No interruptible storage injections allowed during OFO.
Use Elapsed Pro-Rata Rules
Expected Usage-cut nominations to 110% of expected usage so will use same day  of the prior week as proxy.  Generators need to revise expected usage.  Acceptance of changes are at the discretion of SoCal.
Flow Day Diversions don't go into effect until after Cycle 4.  Gas Control will determine if flow day diversion will be allowed.  
If call OFO after cycle 3 or 4 and have interruptible storage injections, such storage will be prorationed back under the elapsed prorata rules.
Many people were concerned that interruptible storage will be severely compromised.  
If OFO called , Interruptible Storage could be cut under the elapsed prorata rules as follows:

Cycle 1    Nom 1000  ; 0 cut
Cycle 2 Nom 1000; 666 cut
Cylce 3 Nom 1000; 500 cut
Windows will only be implemented during cycle 4 if OFO callled after cycle 3 and no improvement is realized.  Will allocate prorata.  Will use latest scheduled volume and will pro rate by receipt point.  In other words, if OFO declared during Cycle 1 and no relief after 3 cycles, Socal will window Cycle 4 and prorata cut. Parties will determine what gets cut on all the other cycles. For penalty purposes, actual burn from 12 o'clock to 12 o'clock will be used to calculate penalties or MAXDQ if not metered.  
For OFO, assume supply delivereis day before and burn is the same day for the prior week.  Declare OFO on prior day's scheduled volume.

For an evening declaration-will use most recent available scheduled volumes.  For example:

         Flow Day 10/4                10/3 Scheduled Volumes
Cycle 1                                    Cycle 2
Cycle 2                                     Intraday 1
Cycle 3				evening cyle 2 on 10/4
Cycle 4                                     Intraday 1 on 10/4

In other words, will look at evening cycle 2 scheduled volumes on the 3rd for declaring OFO on cycle 1 for the 4th.; look at intra day 1 for the 3rd in declaring OFO for cycle 2 on the 4th;  look at evening cycle 2 on 10/4 in declaraing OFO for Cycle 3 on the 4th;  look at intraday 1 on the 4th in declaraing OFO on cycle 4 for the 4th.

Winter Balancing Rules
Effective Nov 1-March 31
No changes.
All customers must comply.
Minimum delivery requirements
50% of daily usage over 5 day period; (Nov 1-5;6-10;)
70% of daily usage depending on storage level
70% daily usage implemented when storage levels equal 20 bcf above peak day min
90% of daily usage depending on storage level
90% rule implemented when storage levels equal 5 bcf  plus peak day min.
Look at storage graph on Gas Select.  Posted 24 hours in advance if the minimum daily is changed.  If go to 70% , current 5 day cycle must end completely, before new % goes into effect.
Must increase storage inventory by 1 bcf above the 70% before going back to 50% rule.
Once 90% rule implemented, will return to 70% as soon as operationally feasible,

Contracted Marketer's customer usage and delivereies are aggregated in one balancing account.

Core Aggregation-subject to 50% daily throughout entire winter period based on DCQ.  
Core-50% of daily throughput for the enitre period,; (Patrick Brown group)
Not subject to 70% and 90% rules.

2 types of gas count toward daily obligation- firm storage withdrawal and flowing gas.  As-available storage and imbalance trading do not count.

Burn=measured daily usage thru electronic measurement,
Min DQ-used if customer does not have electronic measurement.

Customer assessed  GIMB charge if total deliveries is less than 50% of total burn over 5 day period.  Customer purchases gas at daily balancing stand-by rate under  G IMB Rate Schedule which is 150% of highest Socal Border price per NGI Gas Daily plus franchise fees and other charges.  Rate is posted at end of every month.


OFO can be declared during undernom season (winter season)

For those of you that will be in the office after New Year's, we will begin an informal fundies meeting each day to cover what has happened in the market since we filed for bankruptcy.  We will go over pipeline flows, storage balances, weather, monthly and daily prices, etc. With a few of the Banks showing interest in showing a bid, I thought it would be good for us to begin our preparation to trade the market.

Chris Gaskill will be providing the daily packet and Patti Sullivan will provide the daily operations report.   

I was thinking that we should start around 9:30 each morning.

Here's the draft that we discussed on Friday morning. Please take a look at
it and let me know what you think (Jim is on vacation in New York this
week). We've kept it brief. We put the upstream capacity in here in case you
had achieved any further clarity on the disposition of those contracts, but
it should be easy to remove if needed. We also changed from a two-month term
to a three-month term because in the event that neither of us terminates the
contracts by Feb. 15, we could then extend this agreement if we desired and
not end up trying to sell the awkward block of March/April. Please let me
know if you have any questions, and I look forward to discussing the draft.
Thanks, and talk to you soon.

Q3 now over, you will each be receiving in the internal mail a copy of the origination numbers associated with each of your groups.  Please could you ensure the numbers are both;

(i) Correct, and 
(ii) Correctly allocated

Should employees have left the group or company please do not allocate the amount to another originator as this will distort the numbers, just leave the name of the employee and number in place although they have left.   These numbers will be used as a (obviously only one component) component of performance review.  As you know we also monitor the soft targets so please ensure these are correct too.   If you want to check your progress on soft targets - these are available from Faith.

Please send all alterations to Faith Killen or call her on 30352.

Thanks

Louise

1:30 central on October 8th works for me.  Let's see what Barry and Paul say, and if it works for one or both of them, I'll set up a conference call in number.  Thanks Mark.

As could be expected PSCO has finally implemented PRM this year and did a great job of "buying the high'.  Now the rate payers will have lower prices than last year but probably twice as high as they should be.  I would definitely like to discuss it with you.  How about 1:30 central on the 8th?

Mark/Barry--- I finally had a chance to look this week at the Colorado PUC proposed rulemaking amendments regarding price risk management (PRM) for gas utilities.  As we had generally talked about, the appetite for meaningful change to the PUCs rules has been pretty weak by staff and to a great extent by the Commissioners themselves.  These proposed rules reflect some movement toward encouraging utilties to implement PRM, but does NOT require them to implement, nor is there a clear statement that the PUC will allow recovery of costs.  Here's a short list of what's in the rules:

	> costs related to prm may be allowed, and new language is added to better define the standard of review as "whether the utility action was reasonable in light of the information known, or should have been known, at the time of action or inaction".    

	> in the utility's annual Gas PUrchase Plan they must include an exhibit that describes and analyzes the steps the utility has taken to reduce gas price volatility.  It appears to be an informational filing only, but clearly signals that the PUC expects them to take some action or explain why they didn't. 

	> the utility's actual portfolio purchases, included in the costs of purchasing risk managment products,  need to be included in a Gas Purchase Report to be filed annually. This report presumably is the document that the PUC will then use to determine reasonableness of gas cost pass thru.


There are numerous areas that we could comment on in this proposed rulemaking---anywhere from pushing them to be more explicit in advocating that the utility must do prm and that they will recover the costs, to something along the line of turning over their gas supply portfolio to a company that can more effectively manage it.  There is a hearing scheduled for November 1 in Denver, with comments due on or before October 21.  

We would be happy to intervene and file comments in the proceeding and work the issue if you guys would like us to. Might be kind of fun to tweak our friends at Xcel just a bit! Is there a time on Monday Oct 8 or Tuesday Oct 9 that we could talk via phone to determine your level of interest?  I am available mid day on Monday (between 10 and 2:30 central) or Tuesday anytime up until about 3:30.  Please let me know via return e mail or give me a call   #612-339-4599

Anne,

I just got another phone call from Palo Alto.  They still have not received three of their confirms from deals done around the 20th of July.  They have ceased to do additional business with us until they receive these confirms.

thanks,

Kim

INTEROFFICE MEMO

From: John Lavorato & Dave Delainey

To: All of ENA and EES

Re: ENA and EES Industrial SIC Codes

As Enron continues to build its origination and customer business in the US, it is becoming increasingly important that both ENA and EES target the appropriate industries and customers with our respective value propositions.  Double coverage and duplication waste resources and damages Enron's reputation in the market place.  It is also important that the right product, solution and sales technique are utilized to ensure the maximum benefit for our customers and Enron.

Consistent with the past, EES will be focused on those SIC codes or industries that are less energy intensive and are less sophisticated in their management of energy.  ENA shall continue to target and cover those industries and customers that are very energy intensive and employ significant process load.  We ask that both organizations respect the boundary.  In those few cases where this policy is not appropriate, please over communicate to ensure close coordination between ENA and EES before customer contact. 

Effective immediately in the US and regardless of total energy consumption or number of sites, the following SIC codes have coverage responsibility in ENA.  All other industrial and commercial SIC codes and activity will be managed by EES.

ENA SIC Codes:

Primary Metals Mining and Extraction 
Oil and Gas Extraction
Paper and Forest Products
Chemicals - except for pharmaceutical, biotech and small specialty chemical that will be EES customers
Refining
Petroleum and Coal Manufacturing
Plastics and Rubber Manufacturing
Fertilizer
Rail
Auto - restricted to the Big Three - Ford, GM and Daimler-Chrysler
Cement
Aerospace - restricted to Boeing, Raytheon, GE Aircraft, Allied Signal, Hamilton-Sundstrom
Large Agricultural Processing

Barry,
Sorry for not getting back to you. The Power MTM positions are approx $570,000 and all related to physical positions with a total Net Power  position of approx $1.2MM. I have been working with Beverly Ikeda of Puget on the issues and so far so good. Puget is going to deliver a $10MM  Letter of Credit to cover the financial positions. From our conversations, her traders do not anticipate hedging any further and really only need access to short term EOL business. In addition, she and I discussed the needs of bilateral contracts with margining rights to prevent a similar situation from occurring in the future. 

Thanks,
-D

Did any of the gas commercial people respond?  Also, any communications from ENA and Barry T. on this?

Subject:	Southwest Gas filing in Nevada

You may remember that Southwest Gas filed a tariff revision in Nevada that would keep a transportation customer who returns to sales on sales for a term of 5 years.  They modified that request to grandfather customers who returned as a result of this past winter's fiasco.  We filed an opposition to this tariff change back in April (I think it was).  Anyway, the PUC of Nevada has scheduled a hearing on the SW filing for Sept. 24 and I need to know if this is an issue you want to pursue.  I can attend, or I can have outside counsel attend, or we can skip it and rely on our written comments. IF we want to file testimony, it would be due 9/17.  Please let me know what you would like me to do on this.  Thanks.

Thanks for the reply. It would be my expectation that Enron will pay but

will be.

Judy, you were?assigned to my U.S and Canadian  tax returns. I am a
employee of Enron North America and previously was an  employee of Enron
Canada in Calgary.

As we had discussed at the time of my filing, I was  never given any
advise
on my relocation to the U.S. regarding tax issues, As  such I am not
sure
what some of my next moves should be.?I very much  require some
assistance?regarding spousal employment. My wife is a  registered nurse
and
would like to work in the U.S., but I have been advised  that this may
affect my filing in the U.S. and perhaps could cost me more in  U.S.
Taxes.

Can we set up a meeting to discuss strategies on  making sure I am going
about this properly.

This is my home e-mail address, you can contact me  here or at my work
address, Barry.Tycholiz@enron.com.

Thanks in advance.

One of the guys here recieved a call from a guy at EES looking for contacts at gas utilities in the Northwest.  They are hoping to sell them some sort of deal where they provide the utility structured products and the utility pushes them through to the endusers... isn't that my Cascade deal?  Let's discuss Monday, it sounds like something we need to nip in the bud.

Paul,
Thanks for getting back to me this afternoon.  I am sorry that Enron did not
have the best bid in the last round of RFPs Greeley sent out for the
upcomming winter season.  However, I will look forward to receiving your bid
in the future.  I just wanted to take this opportunity to thank you and
Theresa for the excellent customer service Greeley has received regarding
the current summer deal.


Thanks Again,

I would recommend a conference call with your Wyoming contact in advance of that meeting to determine if it makes sense to fly a lot of people to Wyoming.  Mark Whitt is based in Denver and focuses on nat gas marketing.  I believe he has had some discusions in the past with Wyoming re their royalty positions and will likely call to discuss. 

Scott Josey runs our producer finance business which finances/invests in upstream producers and projects.  He has some clients that may be interested in expanding a Wyoming position.

Let me know how you would like to proceed.

Good morning Barry,

Just to let you know that I am on holidays August 11-26, so your
counselling will have to be this week or when I return.

Did Enron provide you with approval for a "Post Arrival Consultation"/PAC?
This is the counselling our PwC Houston office does.  (So, in effect there
are two possible counselling sessions for assignees - the predeparture
counselling you are supposed to receive before you depart Canada and then
there's the PAC).  PwC Houston is prepared to set up the "PAC" - they
simply want to know if you received approval for it.

Thanks,

Barry - For your cost center, I increased travel by $25k and Conferences & Training by $2,697.  I didn't make any other changes to Mark's.  

These two files show the detail.

  

This file shows the combined plan for West Origination.  The "Income Statement" tab is what will be presented to Office of the Chair.

 

Let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks,

I was advised by Lad Lorenz of Socal that their original application sets forth the plan by which they will sell the residual gas in the Montebello storage field.

Can you please advise me of the final tems of the PUC decision (should have been announced yesterday) and get a copy of the application?

Based upon yesterday's conference in D.C., I  think the restructuring of Socal's backbone transportation is about to become a hot topic again! Please keep us apprised.

Regards,

Stephanie

Barry, I'm trying to see if we can do it from 10 - 11 a.m. (Houston time) on Tuesday.  Is this time slot good for you?
Can you also give me some other times on Tuesday (just in case one of the other participants can't do 10 -11)?

Thanks,
S

Here is the Commission's basic policy on reverse open seasons.  I've asked Randy Rich to look into the other aspects of your questions, which we'll discuss shortly.
The Commission has a two-step process for determining whether the market finds an expansion project economically viable. The first step, which occurs prior to the certificate application, is for the pipeline to conduct an open season in which existing customers are given an opportunity to permanently relinquish their capacity. This first step ensures that a pipeline will not expand capacity if the demand for that capacity can be filled by existing shippers relinquishing their capacity.  The second step is that the expansion shippers must be willing to purchase capacity at a rate that pays the full costs of the project, without subsidy from existing shippers through rolled-in pricing. 
The reverse open season requirement (i.e., the requirement that a pipeline give customers the opportunity to turn back capacity) is established Commission policy.  It was stated in the Commission's Pricing Policy for New and Existing Facilities Constructed by Interstate Natural Gas Pipelines, 71 FERC P61,241 at p. 61,917 (1995), reh'g denied, 75 FERC P61,105, and later reiterated in Certification on New interstate Natural Gas Pipeline Facilities (Certificate Policy Statement), 88 FERC P61,227 (1999), order clarifying statement of policy, 90 FERC P61,128, order further clarifying statement of policy, 92 FERC P61,094 (2000).  
My research has indicated that the Commission has provided few specifics on how a reverse open season is to be conducted.  This probably allows pipelines considerable discretion in how they conduct their solicitations of turnback.  General Commission policy would probably require only that shippers be given adequate notice of and opportunity to respond to the reverse open season.  If the procedure used by El Paso for soliciting turnback becomes an issue, please let me know and let's discuss it.  I'll be up in a few minutes for our call to Randy.

Laura, Barry, Chris and Frank,

Thank you for giving Mastio & Company the opportunity to discuss our market
research capabilities for customer satisfaction and benchmarking.

Mastio & Company would like to have the privilege of building a relationship
with you and assisting your efforts in maximizing customer satisfaction and
delight.  We believe that meeting customer needs, and exceeding expectations
is not only one of the most important business processes, but also builds
loyalty and increases profits.

We would be delighted to have you subscribe to the 2001 multi-client Natural
Gas Marketer Customer Satisfaction Study.
The main benefit of Mastio's multi-client report is, not only will you be
able to discover what customers think of you on 30+ customer service
attributes, you will also learn what customers think of 45+ other gas
marketers, as well.  This study will be an excellent tool if you want to
maximize & improve customer satisfaction, measure & plot progress for
improving customer service, benchmark yourself against competitors, retain &
find new customers and build customer loyalty.
Mastio & Company is convinced you would reap substantial benefits by
discovering your perceived level of customer satisfaction.  As in other
highly competitive industries, natural gas marketers are discovering that
ignoring customer dissatisfaction can be a crucial mistake. The bottom line
is, superior customer service is a given these days, not a difference.
Customers now take superior customer service for granted. Customers are
raising their expectations. Leading companies are responding to this trend
by instituting customer service initiatives and measuring their progress,
versus customer needs and their competition.
Customer satisfaction matters with winning companies, especially for
companies interested in profitable growth.  These leading companies have
actually moved customer satisfaction from a slogan to reality.  They have
made a commitment to value and are realizing superior growth and
profitability because their business strategies focus on enhancing the value
of what they offer customers.
I would like to further point out that our report comes with an electronic
version.  The electronic version allows the segmentation of all the
respondents by state, volume, and customer-type, switching status, head to
head comparisons with competitors, etc. The software can be installed on
your network and up to 50 people can query the software at the same time.
The biggest advantage is the custom tagging feature.  This feature allows
the grouping of your customers, for example, by the key person responsible
for interaction, customer service teams by name, territory, profitability,
strategic importance, etc.  The options are unlimited.  This powerful tool
will empower people to do additional analysis on their own.  They will take
ownership, because the analysis of the data is personalized.
Media information about Mastio -  (video and articles) -

In closing, Mastio & Company would welcome the opportunity to deliver you
actionable information when you are ready.

Sincerely,
MASTIO & COMPANY

Bart

We are just looking for further verfication that the RErecall can be enacted on 24 hours notice regarding of the term of the proposed recall.  I believe there are some distinctions relative to the requested term. To the extent that there is a perpetual 24 hour RErecall (is 24 hours based on date recall is effectuated or the date gas flows pursuant to recall?), PG&E paid $58 million for protection that is not worth very much.

Just looking for greater clarification. To the extent it may help us with our position regarding the ability to turn back the 200 M2/d of capacity, it may be worth the expense to have independent verfication.

Thanks,

STeph

Steph:  Exactly what are you looking for - I'm not sure we could give you an opinion of the mechanics.  If you remember, we looked at this issue back in March and I sent you the e-mail message below.  Since then, FERC has issued orders in Docket No. RP00-241 on 3/28/2001 and 6/11/2001 which reaffirmed its rulings in the orders discussed below.  There is no discussion in any of the orders on the specific mechanics of the recall other than what I already noted, namely, if the capacity has been recalled by El Paso or a shipper to serve a PG&E market, and the original shipper wants it back, it can re-recall the recalled capacity on 24 hours notice as long as it is using all of its other Block II capacity.  If you need something more "legal", we'll see what we can do.  If we have to go to Bracewell for a law firm legal opinion, there would be a charge since they'd have to do the same research before they could sign off on one.

Subject:	Re: block II  

I would note also that the recent reallocation of Topock rights takes care of one of the issues -- namely that El Paso allowed Dynegy to take Block II capacity to SoCal Topock.  The 4/14/00 order should have taken care of it, except for El Paso's position that they had capacity at Topock in the aggregate so they weren't overselling it.  

Order Date	Block II Rulings	
6/14/2000 Denial of Rehearing by Operation of Law	Denies Indicated Shippers request for rehearing of 4/14/00 order.	
4/14/2000 Order on Rehearing (Enron)	Clarifies the January 19 order to provide that El Paso may remarket the PG&E turnback capacity, including Block II, for primary delivery to delivery points other than PG&E Topock if capacity is available at those other delivery points.	
1/19/2000 Order on Negotiated Rate Transactions  (Enron & Williams)	Block II capacity has primary delivery rights only at PG&E Topock and alternative rights at the other Topock delivery points. Rejects CPUC argument against the recall provisions, which are the same as ultimately accepted in the Dynegy deal (see 10/19/99, 7/29/99, 9/17/98 and 6/11/98 orders) and provide (1) that there is no right of recall if the Block II capacity is simply idle, (2) that the capacity may be recalled if it is being used to serve points other than those behind PG&E Topock, and (3) if so recalled, it may be recalled by the original shipper for its own use in the PG&E service territory upon 24 hours notice. Clarifies, as in Dynegy, that the shipper (Enron) must use all its other Block II capacity before recalling other Block II capacity, but is not required to use Block I or Block III capacity first.	
10/19/1999 Order on Rehearing and Clarification (Dynegy)	Denies rehearing of 7/29/99 order 	
7/29/1999 Order on Rehearing and Compliance Filing (Dynegy)	 Affirms that PG&E and the CPUC are entitled to have the Block II capacity recalled to northern California even if it is under contract [to Dynegy]. Reverses previous ruling -- does not require that all other capacity to California be utilized before Block II capacity can be recalled. Per Settlement, recalling shipper must pay max rate to recall if its contract is one month or less.  If for more than one month, the rate must equal or exceed the rate of the existing shipper. On 24 hours notice, the existing shipper (i.e., Dynegy) may recall for its own use to serve northern California markets, capacity that was recalled for use by other shippers, even if those shippers are willing to pay a higher rate. Clarifies that if the Block II capacity is idle but is not being used to serve areas outside of northern California, [Dynegy] may hold the capacity without any obligation to release it.	
9/17/1998 Letter Order on Compliance Filing	Requires the Dynegy/El Paso agreement to clearly state that Block II capacity was recallable even though Dynegy had a minimum take requirement. Requires El Paso to eliminate use of alternative delivery points as the defining point for the service that would be recalled -- issue is markets served, not delivery points. Requires elimination of a clause requiring recalling shipper to submit a sworn statement that no capacity was available on other pipelines.	
6/11/1998 	Shippers in northern California cannot recall Block II capacity simply because it is not actually being used by [Dynegy]. Block II is recallable if [Dynegy] is using it to serve end users not within PG&E's service territory. Shippers who want to recall Block II capacity must have an actual need and may only recall if firm capacity is not available to PG&E's service territory via El Paso or via any other pipeline available to the shipper.

Subject:	Block III Recall Rights

Further to our discussions about our EPNG capacity: 

Our research had resulted in an opinion that there is little value associated with PG&E's (northern CA customers) recall rights on Block III capacity.  While it was not part of the original settlement, the 24 hour RE-recall rights to the shipper of record appear to give PG&E a DAILY call on capacity at best. 

Because we have pieced this opinion together based upon rulings in various proceedings, we would like a more formal regulatory/legal opinion of the mechanics of the RE-recall provision that has been developed over time. Is this something that either of you can provide or should it go to Randy? The results of this inquiry will set the tone of our next round of dicussions with EPNG.

 By the way, still waiting on their written reponse to our letter..... I think they have bigger fish to fry.

Please advise.

Stephanie

FYI

State building natural gas reserve
Officials refuse to reveal details of the contracts
Bernadette Tansey, Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Staff Writers

?2001 San Francisco Chronicle

California has quietly started buying natural gas in response to the energy crisis, forming a gas supply operation that could become one of the largest in the state.

But in a repeat of the state's tactics when it lined up $43 billion in electricity contracts, officials won't say how much they have spent so far -- or how much they plan to buy in the future.

The state is already supplying gas for one power plant this month in an attempt to keep generating costs in check, and it has signed a small contract for gas storage space, state officials said. But they refused to provide The Chronicle with records of any of the purchases.

Releasing additional details -- such as the price officials paid -- would jeopardize the state's goal of keeping electricity costs down by delivering cheaper fuel to natural gas-fueled power plants that serve California, said Ray Hart, deputy director of the state Department of Water Resources.

If private energy traders knew what the state planned to buy, Hart said, they could rush in, scoop up the supplies and demand substantially higher prices to resell them to the state, he said.

Details of the state's gas deals will be made public as much as six months after they're signed, when they no longer give traders any advantage, he said.

That stance has raised an outcry among Republicans and consumer advocates, who criticized the Davis administration earlier this year for delaying disclosure of state power contracts that locked in a huge percentage of California's power needs for more than a decade.

"If there were a competitive bidding process, then, yes, the price should be secret while it's pending," said Marcel Hawiger, a natural gas analyst for the consumer group The Utility Reform Network. "But in a situation like it is now where they're just negotiating backroom deals, we think they should be disclosing everything right away."

Critics of the Davis administration who think the state already got rooked on the power contracts are equally leery about the state's foray into the natural gas market.

'A DISASTER'

"The governor's secrecy and lack of oversight has been a disaster for the people of California over the last six months," said Republican gubernatorial candidate and current Secretary of State Bill Jones. "These are the same novices who signed those energy contracts."

Hart said the gas operation would reinforce the state's long-term power buying effort that he credits with taming the out-of-control electricity market in California. His department was pressed into service as an emergency electricity buyer in January after skyrocketing power prices drove state utilities deeply into debt.

The state's new natural gas endeavor is intended as an insurance policy to make sure power plants under long-term contracts with the state don't hike their prices by claiming steep costs for fuel, a justification used by many generators during the height of the energy crisis last winter.

Under terms of some of the state electricity contracts, if the power plants don't make low-cost deals for gas, the state can step in and deliver the fuel itself.

The plan is to stand ready to provide fuel to generators throughout the state by lining up natural gas supplies, setting up to ship gas through pipelines within the state, and arranging for temporary storage space so any state gas surplus can be saved instead of being sold at a loss, Hart said. If the state were to step in as supplier for all the contracts that give it that option, the government would become one of the largest gas purchasers in the state, he said.

Hart's agency signed a four-year, $2 million contract in May with a Livermore gas consulting firm, Interstate Gas Services. The firm was authorized in July to make short-term gas deals with four suppliers in Texas and one in California.


STRATEGY QUESTIONED
Whether the state will be a successful player in the natural gas market is already being questioned by TURN and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. They say the state is reading the future gas market incorrectly by predicting prices close to double what experienced utility gas managers say the state will see by late 2002.

Bill Marcus, a TURN energy consultant, said the state's high forecasts alone could lead to unnecessary rate increases. Ron Low, a PG&E spokesman, said state gas cost overestimates would add $300 million to consumers' bills statewide through 2002; about $140 million would be paid by PG&E customers.

Hart scoffed at PG&E's claims.

"For them to say the price of gas is going to stay the same is ridiculous," Hart said. Gas prices have dropped this summer because of the cool weather and conservation efforts, he said. But things could change rapidly when demand peaks in the future. "You're going to see prices go up again."

Mark Allen Bernstein, an analyst with RAND, said the state might be doing the right thing if it buys natural gas when prices are low in the spring and fall and socks it away in storage basins to release when demand spikes in the summer and winter.

"We need to make sure there is sufficient storage to weather demand and price fluctuations," he said.

The state has lined up a small contract with the Wild Goose storage basin in Butte County and is supplying gas to an Alliance power plant as it starts operations this month, water department officials said. It has also locked in gas supplies at a set price for Dynegy plants in Southern California. The state has still not decided whether to contract for space on the interstate pipelines that bring gas to California from out-of-state producing basins, Hart said.

Hart said critics of the state's electricity contracts who said the deals all should have locked in a fixed price had already been proved wrong. By allowing some of the contract prices to float up or down with the price of gas,

Hart said, the state has been able to take advantage of a steep drop in gas prices this spring.

"We got totally hammered by the media for those (variable) contracts," Hart said. "My God, we're saving billions of dollars."

It looks like we are done on the new Citizens deal effective July 1.  I have sent original contracts for execution.  We now have to put the deal in the system.  This is a little complicated.  

The attached spreadsheet indicates how this deal will work, using June as an example.  The only differences between June and future months are:

1)  In the future, we will collect a $.09/MMBtu demand charge with $.02/MMBtu of this going to EAMR (ENA gets $.07/MMBtu)
2)  In the future, the PG&E discount is $.10, not $.25.

Some of the complicated booking issues are:

1.  We need to show the John Cogan commission as a separate deal and a cost to ENA
2.  We need to show the payment to EAMR as a separate deal and a cost to ENA
3.  We will continue to bill Citizens for the TW Mainline cost on our utility deal

1 and 2 above are pretty straight forward and should not create any deal entry difficulties other than someone will have to enter the deals.  Number 3 is more difficult.  The complexities relate to where we are making the sale and what costs should be included.  

Can you get with the folks who can help us here and have them come up with a recommendation on how this deal should be booked?  Let me know if you have questions.  I also believe I can add value in speaking with Darren Giron or others.  I guaranty their initial recommendation will not be 100% workable.

Thanks!

Chris

FYI. The California AG has announced that he is investigating conflict of interest charges against consultants who were involved with arranging DWR's long term power contracts. May be part of Davis' attempt to "re-negotiate" the contracts.  There's been some assertions that, under California law, any contracts negotiated by consultants with financial conflict of interests must be nullified.

Per Barry's request, attached is the Agency and Management Services Agreement to be executed between Enron North America Corp. and Mexicana De Cobre.  Also attached is the form of agency agreement to be attached as Exhibit B to the Agency and Management Services Agreement.  This agency agreement is El Paso's form and must be executed by ENA, Mexicana, and El Paso.  The El Paso form requires that you open as a read only file.
Please review.

  

We are working on the gas purchase agreement and should forward shortly.

We received the power of attorney and bylaws you emailed.  I had a Spanish speaking attorney in our office assist me with their review.  The bylaws look fine. We would like you to follow up with a certified copy in the mail.   For now can you confirm via a response to this email, that these are the latest bylaws on file?  

 He noted that under the Power of Attorney, it would be required that two of the gentlemen listed on page 2 of the power of attorney documentation, execute our agreements.  Can you confirm?  Would be happy to discuss this with you.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Hey Paul----I did get together with Barry Tycholiz this afternoon when I was in Houston to review the matrix that we have on price risk management initiatives and current practice at the state PUCs in the west.  As you know, the matrix is a starting point, and I encouraged Barry to take a stronger look at his opportunities in each state and that we would do further spade work in those states as he identifies his prospects.  We talked about 3 states that he has initial interest in--- California (Barry is already talking to Dasovich and I will touch base with Jeff tomorrow to follow up), Colorado and Nevada.  

I will be reviewing the proposed rulemaking in Colorado in the next few days and will send Barry and Mark Whitt an outline of what the issues boil down to so that we can have a discussion on how active/what strategy we might want us to pursue at the PUC.  As you will recall, we have the opportunity to submit comments until the end of October. While the appetite for taking sustantive action on PRM in at the Commision is limited (only the Chair has a strong interest--his other two commissioners are skeptical and the primary staff person has been quite negative), Barry is not adverse to considering a long shot position.

Although we didn't get into alot of detail on Nevada, Barry is in discussions with Sierra on gas supply and I indicated that you had past experience and ongoing relationships with both the Nevada commission and Sierra and could be a great resource for him.  Could you please give him a call (#713-853-1587) when you get a chance.  Thanks!  

I think you're in meetings most of the day tomorrow, but if you get a chance, catch up with me. I am back in Minnesota.

Gerald, I attach a copy of the current form of master physical gas agreement ECC has in place with CNR.  Randy will send you a credit worksheet in the next half hour.  Can you make sure that your form of master has the triangular setoff language that Mark Haedicke distributed a month or so ago to be included in all agreements, as CNR wants to ensure there is cross-affiliate setoff.  Once it is prepared, Howard Sangwine, the commercial contact in Calgary, will walk the document over to CNR, so you can send it to me and I will get it to him.

Thanks for your help.

Greg

We have reserved room EB 4746 from 3:15-4 pm today to discuss status on the SoCal margin agreement.  SoCal is still holding to the deadline of tomorrow; this morning I asked for a couple of additional days while we work through the details but they have not yet agreed to an extension.

We need to cover, at a minimum -
1) suggested wording changes to the agreement 2) sign off on operational coordination between EES and ENA 3) agreement from Credit to the change  4) understanding of final internal signoffs necessary

Barry,

As promised, here are some of the current redeployment candidates that have a marketing/structuring/trading background for consideration concerning your West Origination opening.  I believe that you have seen Jim Lowe before and expressed some limited interest in him.  The other candidates are most likely new to you.

Let me know if you would like to pursue any of these redeployed employees.


     

Also, I spoke with Mark McConnell today, and he mentioned that he had accepted the offer to join the Transwestern group of ETS.  He primary motivation for selection of this option was his desire to work with asset deals.  As we know, given EWS "asset light" approach to deal making, this option would be difficult to fulfill within the West Origination group.  However, he mentioned that he was very impressed with your group, and short of the asset piece maintained a high interest in your open position.

Regards,
Todd Peikert

Hi, everyone. Sorry for the delay in responding to all the messages and
emails regarding the meetings sponsored by SRP. There were a few people who
were in Phoenix before the WTC disaster and we did meet on Wednesday to do
some brainstorming. This email is an attempt to share the discussions with
those of you who were not here.

The parties who met were SRP, APS, PD, SWG, SoCal and the ACC. Joel Greene,
Barbara Jost, Kelly Daly and Dave Huard were here as legal counsel and Greg
Lander was here as a consultant. There are no new proposals on the table. W=
e
did discuss ways to get to a point where we might be able to talk settlemen=
t
and whether or not parties might be willing to turn back capacity. No
surprise that we keep coming back to "what do you use to allocate the
existing capacity". Greg is going to run some numbers for the EOC based on
different starting scenarios using the assumption that CD capacity will be
made available at some level. He will also be looking at the impact of
seasonalizing the EOC loads.

SRP will reschedule the meetings (or arrange a conference call) to discuss
settlement once we have Greg's analysis. I wouldn't expect anything before
the end of September unless it is a conference call.

Thanks to everyone for letting me know your status during the week. It was =
a
relief to know everyone was safe somewhere.

FERC today issued an Initial Decision in the hearing in the Transwestern case concerning several negotiated rate agreements to which Indicated Shippers and the CPUC had raised objections.  Briefly, the Judge ruled that Transwestern had not exercised market power and that the capacity was advertised and awarded in accordance with Transwestern's tariff.  However, Transwestern must modify its tariff to add a separate provision where all the posting, bidding and award procedures for purposes of awarding capacity are clearly stated.  A highlighted copy of the ruling is attached for your information.

PG&E restructuring bid draws state ire 
By Dale Kasler and Carrie Peyton
Bee Staff Writers 
(Published Sept. 21, 2001)

In a controversial attempt to dig its way out of bankruptcy, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. proposed a radical restructuring Thursday that would pay off its debts but end state regulation of the utility's valuable hydroelectric and nuclear plants. 
To make the plan work, PG&E asked a U.S. bankruptcy judge to override state laws and regulations governing power-plant ownership -- a request that triggered immediate opposition from California officials. 
PG&E said the plan, a complicated blend of asset transfers, debt refinancing and corporate spinoffs, would restore the utility's financial health and creditworthiness without requiring additional rate hikes or a state "bailout." Divorcing the utility from its parent company, the plan would pay off the entire $13.2 billion of debt PG&E accumulated during California's poorly executed era of deregulation. 
The plan, filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in San Francisco, had the support of a key block of creditors, including independent energy generators, whose approval is necessary to any reorganization plan. 
But it ran into immediate opposition from Gov. Gray Davis and other state officials, setting up a potentially fierce battle. Despite PG&E's claims to the contrary, they warned the plan could trigger more hikes because PG&E could charge nearly double the amount it currently charges for electricity from the hydro and nuclear plants. The proposal would have the state Public Utilities Commission relinquish control over those plants to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
FERC "has proven over the last 18 months to be ... no friend of the ratepayer," Davis told reporters Thursday. "The PUC, while far from perfect, has been a stronger advocate for ratepayers than the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. ... I'm very wary of PG&E's proposal to transfer all of its generating capacity from a regulated environment to a non-regulated environment." 
The PUC vowed to fight the plan in court. "I don't think the judge is going to do it," said PUC President Loretta Lynch. 
Consumer advocates noted that PG&E has been pushing for years to end state regulation of its hydro plants. "It's complete piracy," said Nettie Hoge, head of The Utility Reform Network of San Francisco. "It's the most audacious thing I've ever seen." 
Filed six months after the utility sought bankruptcy protection, the plan calls for PG&E to be spun off from PG&E Corp., but the utility would transfer its hydro and nuclear plants and some other assets to the parent. 
That would violate a state law, passed as a response to the energy crisis, prohibiting utilities from selling any of their generating plants before 2006. The law was intended to keep electricity in California hands at a time when out-of-state generators were charging ultra-high prices to PG&E and Southern California Edison. 
PG&E acknowledged the conflict with state law but said it will ask the bankruptcy court -- a federal entity -- to override the state law. Legal experts said it's not clear whether a bankruptcy judge would ignore state law, and in prior rulings U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali has sided with state officials. 
"Any federal court would be very reluctant to go in and override state laws," said influential state Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Rey, chair of the Senate Energy Committee. 
Robert D. Glynn Jr., PG&E's chairman, called the transfer a good deal for customers. He said the electricity from those plants would be sold back to the utility at about $50 a megawatt hour -- "the lower end" of current rates -- under a 12-year contract. 
But that's almost double the existing rates for those plants, critics said. 
And Gary Cohen, the PUC's general counsel, said the company would be free to charge market rates when the contract runs out, putting utility customers at the mercy of an independent, unregulated generator. 
"This is more of what got us into this mess to begin with," Cohen said. 
Despite the friction between PG&E and the state, the plan requires assurance from the PUC that the utility will be allowed to collect its wholesale power costs in the future from ratepayers, regardless of how high they go. Such assurance will make the utility creditworthy again and able to borrow money to fund the reorganization, PG&E said. 
The plan also requires approval from federal officials and a "yes" vote from a majority of PG&E's creditors, along with Montali. 
Glynn said the plan could be completed by December 2002, enabling the utility to resume buying electricity. The state has been buying power for PG&E since January, when it became insolvent. 
While the PUC raised rates an average of 40 percent this year, the reorganization plan doesn't require another rate hike, Glynn insisted. "From the customers' view, this transaction will be seamless," he said. The same should be true for most employees, he said. 
The PG&E chairman, whose company has feuded with Davis for months, also boasted that PG&E isn't "asking the state for a bailout or a rescue" -- a jab at Davis' as-yet-unsuccessful effort to sell the Legislature on a multibillion-dollar rescue for Edison. 
It's unclear what impact PG&E's proposal would have on Edison's attempt to avoid bankruptcy. Edison's creditors, already angered that the Legislature adjourned without passing the Davis-backed plan, might conclude that Edison is better off in bankruptcy and could push the Southern California utility into court, analysts said. 
The PG&E proposal involves a complicated series of property transfers and bond offerings that would leave the current PG&E Corp. split into two separate, publicly-traded companies. 
The utility company, Pacific Gas and Electric, would become strictly a retailer and would sell other assets -- including its hydro and nuclear plants, transmission wires and gas pipelines -- to PG&E Corp. for $4.06 billion in cash and IOUs. PG&E Corp. shareholders would receive stock in the slimmed-down utility, although the details of the stock transaction haven't been worked out. 
The bankruptcy proposal represents the fourth time in three years that PG&E has tried to remove its hydro plants from state control. The PUC and Legislature have resisted because of potential impacts on costs and the environment. 
Despite the criticism, PG&E said removing those assets from regulators' oversight is essential to making the plan work. Why? Because PUC rules limit how much money the utility can borrow against those assets, said utility spokesman Ron Low. If the assets became property of PG&E Corp., the corporation could borrow a lot more money and use the proceeds to pay its debts. Glynn said he's had "in-depth discussions" with investment bankers about issuing new bonds. 
Also, by removing the generating plants from PUC oversight, the plan can produce more cash for debt repayment, said credit analyst David Bodek of Standard & Poor's Corp. in New York. 
If state officials fight the plan, "the question arises, 'How do you discharge these (debts)?' " Bodek said. "Here's a plan that does that." 
The plan would pay creditors $9.1 billion in cash and $4.1 billion in bonds. Creditors with debts of more than $100,000 would get 60 percent in cash and 40 percent in bonds, which will be paid in 10 or more years, said Paul Aronzon, attorney for a committee of unsecured creditors. 
"There's some credibility here, and it works," Aronzon said of the plan. 
Gary Ackerman, a spokesman for independent generators, said his group would probably accept the plan, even if it means they have to wait years to get some of their money. 
Shareholders also endorsed the plan. PG&E Corp.'s stock jumped $1.22, to $15.72, on a day when the markets took another bad fall

Dear Western Region:

	I would like to thank Phillip Allen for his leadership of the west desk for 2000 and 2001.  He will continue as Managing Director at Enron North America and trade a financial book for the natural gas trading group.  Phillip will be sitting near the western region and will continue to participate in our goal to analyze the western market fundamentals to maximize wholesale trading efforts.  I will be assuming all management responsibilities of the west trading group effective immediately.

	I would like to take the opportunity to discuss our new organization for the Western Region trading group.  I have organized a vertical based trading structure that clearly defines each employee's responsibilities going forward.   Our goal is to organize all of our efforts in the west such that we will offer Enron North America the most profitable wholesale trading model.

The most significant change to the western region organization will be Keith Holst's role as Director of West Fundamentals.  Keith will manage this unit from the west desk, while using the services of Enron's centralized fundamentals group, headed by Chris Gaskill.  Our western region Fundamentals group will be responsible for delivering the most complete and market sensitive data to the trading desk.  We will all share in Keith's efforts to make our fundamental analysis the standard for all trading units within the company.

West Origination, led by Barry Tycholiz, will play a larger role in our term trading efforts going forward.  They will be joining our desk for fundamental forecasting meetings and discussions.  Our goal is to capture a majority of the term risk management efforts of our customer base.  We must succeed in capturing a majority of our customers' business to increase our share of lower risk earnings.  This contribution, along with our wholesale trading, will help our desk beat earnings expectations consistently.     

The West trading organization is structured to maximize profitability by sub-region.  The emphasis for the trading group will be to increase profitability and market information from each trader's sub-region.   We will be evaluated on how we organize and build the business and profitability in our respective trading areas.  This structure, however, does not preclude west traders from trading positions throughout the Western region and the North American gas market.  The West trading organization will be successful by creating accountability for trading responsibilities.
  
Please review the attached outline for the new trading structure.  We will be meeting as a group to discuss the changes soon.  The implementation of this structure will rely on our back office to set up the new books for each trader.  

Sincerely,

Michael D. Grigsby
West Gas Trading

Barry, hope that you had a great Christmas.  Just wanted to touch base. I am continuing to handle some issues from home on KeySpan and some Florida contracts.  I am not scheduled back until Jan 3.  Let me know if I can do anything.

     Barry: I will send a note to Jacy. Also the funds I think we will
go 
     into are going to be more heavily weighted towards stocks, but will
     
     have some bonds as well, that what makes them a balanced fund.
Also, 
     do want us to manage the money Jacy has, or do you want to leave it
     
     with him? No problem either way, just let me know.

I wasn't worried for a second.
     
I would like to have these funds in a portfolio that has a better 
performance than money markets. I already have a decent amount of money 
( 60K) in the Rice portfolio thru andrew agencies in Virden. You may 
want to look at exactly what that is, contact Jacy Whyte at Andrew 
Agencies... he will get you the details for Kim and I. 
     
Was there a particular index fund you had in mind? What do you mean by 
balanced ? Once we put it there I don't plan on touching or managing 
this until I return to Canada.  
     
Thanks, talk to you soon.

     Barry:
     
     You probably thought I had forgotten about you! I had not. I wanted
to 
     iron out some areas of concern from my end here. As you know, I am
not 
     supposed to do an investment for you while you are a resident of
the 
     US. I have discovered that if we put the money into an account and
not 
     make moves on it until you move back to Canada, then we can do it
if I 
     use a Canadian address. I was advised to put the money into a
balanced 
     fund and leave it there for now. My thoughts are to move it to a 
     couple of funds in a self administered account and NOT make any
moves 
     with it. 
     
     Please review this note, and let me know what you think. If all is
ok 
     I will mail you the forms to sign (which you signed here), and we
will 
     get this moving.
     
     Hope all is well with you down there.

No new details to report.  Same settlement to unbundle socal that's been before the commission for about a year.  On the commission's agenda to consider, but as has been the case for over year, they've delayed any movement--at least one commissioner doesn't like competition and has the discretion to continue to ask that it be delayed.  Some hold the view that there's a push to try to get it moved, but best guess is 50-50 at this point.  Substantively, though, same thing that's been before them for a very long time, i.e., emulate PG&E's gas accord (more or less) on socal.

Best,
Jeff

I am reading an article in NGI that talks about how California Regulator's are scheduled to approve some form of unbundling on Socal's system.  Please provide details of this as soon as it happens.  Thank you.

Are you referring to the Kern origination?  If so, it appears that the orig has not yet been redistributed.  Who controls the changes/updates to the orig reports?

Regarding your comments on the Pricing Sheet - I just want to make sure I understand what you are looking for.  Where you suggesting that I include historical NYMEX  final settles (previous 12 months?) in addition to the current forward strip?

Barry,

Thanks for the updates on the previous candidates.  I am forwarding the resume of Todd Neugebauer from EBS London.  Todd is a manager in the origination group who is currently searching for potential opportunities in the States.  He can be reached at the numbers as listed below.  Let me know if you are interested, as Todd will be in Houston next week if you would care to meet with him in person.

Regards,
Todd Peikert

Per your request, here is a copy of my resume.  As I mentioned on our call, I am planning to be in Houston later next week and would be available to meet with members of the group then (possibility I may be in all week).  If that doesn't work, I am definitely able to speak by phone.

The state treasurer sent a letter this afternoon to Loretta Lynch.
The treasurer claims in the letter that, by extending DA  through Sept. 20th, the PUC could have shifted more than $8 billion to small customers.
He urges Lynch to immediately roll back the date to July 1.
We have started working with large customers to refute the letter.
If you would like a copy of the letter, please send your fax number to Joseph Alamo.

Best,
Jeff

Judy, you were?assigned to my U.S and Canadian  tax returns. I am a
employee of Enron North America and previously was an  employee of Enron
Canada in Calgary.

As we had discussed at the time of my filing, I was  never given any advise
on my relocation to the U.S. regarding tax issues, As  such I am not sure
what some of my next moves should be.?I very much  require some
assistance?regarding spousal employment. My wife is a  registered nurse and
would like to work in the U.S., but I have been advised  that this may
affect my filing in the U.S. and perhaps could cost me more in  U.S. Taxes.

Can we set up a meeting to discuss strategies on  making sure I am going
about this properly.

This is my home e-mail address, you can contact me  here or at my work
address, Barry.Tycholiz@enron.com.

Thanks in advance.

BT

This may be too early, but just in case....I will save the good-byes until they become absolutely necessary.

Could I have your outside e-mails and possibly your phone #'s?  If you feel uncomfortable giving these to me, that is o.k.  The following is my information.

The numbers I sent you DID include Alliance. Do you want the numbers excluding Alliance? I could do that also.
Please let me know.

has there been a change in the way we are calculating field receipts for Alberta that supports the significant month on month growth.  Do we now include Alliance in here ? It appears to be a dramatic increase relative to historicals.

We have accepted your suggested revision to Article 13 of the Agency and Management Agreement.  Attached is a new executable with the language revised.   Also attached for execution are the gas purchase confirm and associated GTC for the gas purchase through Monday June 4.  The GTC was revised to remove the $0.15 per MMBtu liquidated damages.  Thanks.

Great.  Figured they'd contacted them, but wanted to make sure.  You know when the meeting with schedulers will be?  I apologize, I'm on the road and haven't heard when that will be.  I'm thinking that I may want to attend.  Thanks.

If you haven't heard, SoCal's announced their abandoning windows for OFOs.  They're holding "workshops" on how it will all work soon.  I'll get you the announcement.

The Enron Center Garage has opened.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new building and are currently parking in an Enron Contract garage you are being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. 

The  Sky Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until  Sky Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a an information packet for the new garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions.

Hi,

	My name is Iris Mack.  Currently I work on Enron's Power Options Trading desk.  

	I am primarily responsible for building our business in long-term, derivatives structures/trades on multiple commodities and financials.  For example, we are exploring potential structures and trades which involve power, gas, crude oil, weather derivatives, metals, etc.  Some of the building blocks for these multi-commodity derivatives products may be found in the attached document.

 	We are looking to build this business via utilizing as many of Enron's internal resources as possible.  Hence, it would be most helpful to meet with the relevant individuals in Gas Trading who would be interested in the development of multi-commodity derivatives trades/structures which may used to develop customized risk management tools for our clients.
	
	Thank you in advance for your assistance.
    
Kind regards,
Iris Mack, MBA/PhD

Stephanie - I question whether your buy-out idea would fly.  The major thing that got the CPUC in the settlement was the recall rights of Block II which assured that the former PG&E customers would always have firm rights to cheap gas - at least for the term of the settlement.  Removing them would require a tariff change, and I can't see the CPUC agreeing.

Subject:	Turnback of EPNG Capacity
Importance:	High
Sensitivity:	Confidential

I have had several conversations with EPNG about the possibility of ENA turning back capacity to satisfy 1) requests for new capacity in the Power Up 2000 project and 2) any possible capacity that EPNG may need to provide to satisfy incremental needs of full requirements customers as they convert billing determinants to Contract Demand quantities.

In order to preserve our position, should I send a formal letter to Al Clark stating our desire to turn the capacity back? The Power Up 2000 deadline is noon, Thursday, August 2, 2001. They did not provide for turn back in the posting that is currently on the capacity system. While we do not know how EPNG will be forced to resolve their capacity issues in the receipt point allocation proceeding, I believe that a letter can help us preserve our position should we choose to turn back capacity under either scenario.

We have approx. 54,000 of Block I and III capacity and 200,000 of Block III capacity. The Block II capacity is subject to PG&E recall - PG&E paid approx. $58 million for those recall rights in a settlement. Could EPNG pay a negotiated sum of money for the remaining value of the recall rights to fund the needs full requirement customers? I have to believe this option would be cheaper than adding new  capacity.

Leslie - could you help me with the letter?

Many thanks!

Stephanie

Phil,
I have attached a presentation that I threw together for the Calgary office regarding Rockies fundamentals.  It doesn't flow particularly well, but it contains the most significant information from a few different prior presentations relating to the Rockies.  Thought it might be useful as you work on the "Fundamentals Packet".

 

Give me a call if you have any questions.

Barry, what did you do to the company!?  Listen, sorry to hear about the 
problems at ENRON.  What a strange turn of events.  It is pretty bizarre 
after 10 years of ENRON being the model for other companies on how to 
succeed in the energy industry. What's your take on why it happened?  We get 
a little bit of news down here but we're a little out of touch.

How are you taking it?  Are you pissed? Do you feel like you squeezed pretty 
much what you wanted out of the job? What's the next thing for Barry Tic?  
Well, like all of life's curve-balls there is always something sweet in the 
next pitch you get (jeez, how sappy is that!).  Anyway, hope you're taking 
it all with the good nature you always do.

Hey, maybe this will give you the chance to take a holiday in Ecuador 
(Christmas turkey at our house this year?).  Say hi to Kim for us, drop me a 
line as soon as you can (a better address to reach me is craigh@ph.com.ec).  
Sorry I haven't sent a note before this but you know we are always rooting 
for you.

Your pal, Craig.

Baldwin's traveling--meeting with DWR today.  But he knows we want to meet and knows the days we're talking about--left a message with his secretary.  I suspect that, if DWR is free on either Monday or Tuesday, we'll be meeting.

Followed up with Fielder this morning.  He's at an off-site all day and is supposed to call me back COB today.  He knows we want to meet with Craver and offered to set it up.  If he hasn't got it scheduled when I talk to him, I'll go directly to Craver.  I'll hopefully have things more set in stone by end of today or tomorrow by noon.

That work?

Just got off the phone with Rick Hawley--Puget's CFO.  He was very cordial and indicated the company was interested in talking with us.  We had a fairly open discussion of who we should contact.  In the end, he suggested that we call Bill Gaines, VP Energy Supply.  He said that as CFO he is head of the Risk Management Committee and that anything that was discussed with Bill would go through his committee.  I highlighted the notion that we were interested in talking about services that could be helpful to their risk management efforts and that would be beneficial to both of our companies.  

By the way, at the beginning of the call, I made clear that we were not talking about total outsourcing.  

He didn't immediately respond, but in the context of our discussion re:  who to talk to he stated that we should talk to him if we wanted to have a more strategic discussion on outsourcing.  Then he said something to the effect of "of course, we're not at all interested in a more comprehensive outsourcing product."

Bill's number is 425.462.3145.  He said that we can tell Bill, Rick suggested we call him directly.

via an
intermediary to a Cayman Island company secretly owned by the majority
shareholder who sells the rights to all seven cows back to your listed

Barry and Stephanie, I'll check on this when I get in in the morning.  I ha=

 filing, but I may have it confused with another proceeding.  I was going t=

Yep - in fact, they did.  I just haven't got around to summarizing the orde=
r yet.  Here's some excerpts:=20

"We reach no determination regarding whether PG&E Transmission's system-wid=
e cost of fuel will increase above the current cost, since the outcome depe=
nds on numerous factors, such as the total pipeline volumes transported and=
 the price of fuel.  Instead, as discussed below, and in accordance with En=
ron's request [way to go, FERC!!], we will act to insulate existing shipper=
s from increased fuel costs attributable to the proposed expansion."

After suggesting that it would have been more appropriate to calculate fuel=
 costs by using the average of the latest twelve months of actual data in p=
lace of the theoretical maximum rate, FERC directed "PG&E Transmission to d=
esign a surcharge to ensure that expansion shippers are subject to an incre=
mental fuel charge for fuel costs above the costs attributable to fuel abse=
nt the proposed addition of 97,500 horsepower of compression.  In addition,=
 PG&E must indicate compliance with this condition whenever it files to adj=
ust its compressor fuel surcharge and whenever it files its annual gas fuel=
 reimbursement reports." (emphasis added)

According to the Draft Order that was voted out at the Commission meeting t=
oday, the subject project, as amended to reflect the approval of the Califo=
rnia Action Project, is approved, subject to certain conditions including r=
estrictions on rolled-in rate treatment. =20

The Commission was concerned that the additional fuel costs could exceed th=
e rate reduction to existing shippers.  Kern River's projections were based=
 on a $3.00/dth cost of gas.  The Commission conditioned its approval of ro=
lled-in rate treatment by providing that, "in its future compliance tariff =
filing to roll-in the costs and lower transmission rates, Kern River must s=
ubmit revised exhibits showing the excess revenues over the incremental cos=
t-of-service, and the net benefits after anticipated fuel costs are conside=
red" (Kern River's settlement in RP99-274 requires it to reduce its rates f=
or existing customers coincident with the in-service date for newly certifi=
cated facilities if it receives approval for rolled-in rate treatment).  Ad=
ditionally, if during any year, the combined level of the electric and gas =
fuel expenses exceed the benchmark level(s) of excess revenues established =
in the tariff filing, then Kern River must allocate the excess portion of f=
uel costs to its expansion shippers.  Thus, Kern River must always assure t=
hat this expansion does not increase costs for existing shippers.

The Commission rejected concerns of the existing firm shippers as well as S=
oCal Gas about the potential for additional curtailment at Wheeler Ridge.  =
The Commission found that the potential for increased curtailment did not w=
arrant rejection or modification of Kern River's proposal, in part because =
SoCal Gas does not offer firm service on its system and therefore existing =
shippers have never had any assurance that Socal Gas would accept their gas=
. =20

The Draft Order is 49 pages long.  Please advise if you would like a hard c=
opy.

M=09ENT DISCUSSIONS ONLY
Importance:=09High

Attached are three documents (cover memo, draft settlement proposal,
settlement procedures timeline) comprising SRP's formal proposal to resolve
five pending dockets, RP99-507 (Indicated Shippers' Complaint), RP00-336
(Order No. 637 Allocation and Pooling Issues only), RP99-139 (ONEOK
Complaint), RP01-484 (Indicated Shippers/California Complaint), and RP01-48=
6
(Texas, New Mexico and Arizona Shippers' Complaint). We appreciate the
suggestions received to date and believe that while an uncontested
settlement may be unlikely, a sufficient nucleus is forming around the
elements of this proposal that will lead to the filing of an Offer of
Settlement and ultimate FERC approval as in the public interest.  We
encourage your active participation in this process.

Note that while Advisory Staff present at the July 18 Technical Conference
is aware conceptually that SRP will be distributing a settlement proposal,
this proposal has not been distributed to the Advisory Staff.  This proposa=
l
has been sent to Rick Miles, Director, Dispute Resolution Services, for
informational purposes only at this time.

Hope all is well with both of you! 

As Colin and I discussed, we are looking to place some transportation capacity. In that regard, I offer the attached proposal for your consideration. I believe these transportation paths are a good fit for your needs on PG&E. This proposal offers diversity of supply (Baja and Redwood) for your generation projects on the PG&E system. You would also receive the future benefit of existing tolls relative to incrementally priced expansions.Start date is open for discussion.

Please call me as soon as possible - we are going to move fast.

Best regards,

Stephanie

Jeff, Gas Daily has an article on DWR activities for purchasing gas.... do you know Pete Garris and is he the guy we want to get together with... or is Balwin's co. going to carry the ball. I remain unclear as to who actually is doing the gas buying..

Further to our conversation of last week... let's meet with these guys soonest.

Revised per your request.  I did remove the conditions precedent.  All outs in the Cinergy Trading Firm Contract have expired.  I understand that Kern has a final certificate from FERC.  Is this the case?

We do need to have the executed assignment docs, before we sign this paper.

Kim:

Here is a summary of the structure we are using to buy gas from the gas desk for Harbor.  This is basically what I plan on using for any future tolling deals that come up.  We can always enhance the structure by replacing the Gas Daily with a fixed price or NGI border price.  

Also, can you get me an indicative 5 year offer for PG&E Citygate out of August for 10,000 MMBtu/d?

Thanks!

Attached is a summary of the new gas deal.  Essentially, we will sell selling Gas Daily mid plus $.10 on a variable basis will a cash out on imbalances each month.  This will become effective on June 1 and on a month to month thereafter.  I have added a clause that indicates that EPMI will be assured we will collect our gas costs each month.  Please let me know if these terms do not represent your understanding.

Further to our discussions about our EPNG capacity: 

Our research had resulted in an opinion that there is little value associated with PG&E's (northern CA customers) recall rights on Block III capacity.  While it was not part of the original settlement, the 24 hour RE-recall rights to the shipper of record appear to give PG&E a DAILY call on capacity at best. 

Because we have pieced this opinion together based upon rulings in various proceedings, we would like a more formal regulatory/legal opinion of the mechanics of the RE-recall provision that has been developed over time. Is this something that either of you can provide or should it go to Randy? The results of this inquiry will set the tone of our next round of dicussions with EPNG.

 By the way, still waiting on their written reponse to our letter..... I think they have bigger fish to fry.

Please advise.

Stephanie

Jaime, further to our conversations earlier. I look forward to our proposed meeting and will coordinate efforts with Stephanie Miller to prepare for ENA's discussion items.  I have decided for at least the next week or so to defer my travel plans ( I am not the best flyer at the best of times ).. As such, we should work towards the end of the month as a timeline for us to come down. 

We can nail down specific dates soonest.

Faizal.... sorry for the delay in providing a quote to you on this
project.

We continue to work on numbers and have had other co's contact us for a
quote.

At this time, do you know if TransAlta is going to pursue submitting a
response to this project?  Do you still require numbers from us?

If so, then I need to coordinate with the appropriate desks pricing and
ENA's response to you and other co's!! ( if any)

Drop me a note as soon as possible and I will go from there. Thanks. BT

Here is the presentation made by Williams Gas Pipeline at COGA.  Nothing earth shattering in it, but it has a few good slides (proposed generation along Kern, Northwest displacement fix, etc.).

THE NATION
El Paso Rests Its Case in Gas Hearing
 Energy: Firm accused of price gouging ends arguments, though judge warned there's evidence it manipulated market.

By RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER


WASHINGTON -- A Texas natural gas conglomerate accused of price gouging in California unexpectedly rested its case Monday, even though a judge warned that the state has presented credible evidence the company attempted to take unfair advantage of the energy crisis.

Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr. of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said he had wanted El Paso Corp. to present witnesses to explain tape-recorded phone calls that he says raised suspicions of an inside deal to manipulate California's natural gas market.

The California Public Utilities Commission is alleging that El Paso created artificial natural gas shortages last year, helping drive electricity prices to record levels. The state wants FERC to order refunds of at least $184 million. But the company said its critics had not presented any new evidence and had failed to prove their allegations. FERC's governing board had initially dismissed complaints of insider dealing, but it recently authorized Wagner to take a closer look.

"If anything happens here, I am sure it is going to be all political," said El Paso spokeswoman Norma Dunn. "There is absolutely no new evidence. FERC already looked at this the first time and found that El Paso did not violate any rules. How can they come back and say we did?"

Kevin Lipson, a lawyer for plaintiff Southern California Edison, called El Paso's decision "one of the dumber moves I've ever seen": valid from a legal standpoint but "a public relations disaster. . . . The judge is saying we're going to have to draw our own conclusions if they don't present witnesses."

The case is considered the closest thing to a full-blown trial of allegations that corporate scheming--not merely an imbalance of supply and demand--contributed to California's energy woes.

At issue is a controversial contract between two subsidiaries of the Houston-based company: El Paso Natural Gas Co., a pipeline regulated by FERC; and El Paso Merchant Energy, an energy marketing company.

The marketing company last year acquired the right to ship 1.2 billion cubic feet of natural gas a day through a critical pipeline serving Southern California. CPUC alleges that Merchant used inside information to win the deal and later withheld supplies of gas to drive up prices. Once the contract expired May 31 and some 30 other companies acquired the shipping rights, natural gas prices plunged.

Wagner, FERC's chief administrative law judge, has until early October to render an initial decision to the agency's governing board. FERC has the power to order the return of any ill-gotten profits, but the company would likely appeal such a penalty to the federal courts.

A few weeks ago, Wagner dismissed Gov. Gray Davis' demand for $8.9 billion in electricity refunds from out-of-state suppliers. In the El Paso case, however, he has been a thorn in the side of industry.

El Paso chief executive William Wise had been expected to take the stand Monday afternoon, when the company abruptly shifted its strategy in a dramatic legal gambit.

Dan Collins, an El Paso attorney, told the judge that the company would rest its case. Collins held out the possibility that Wise might yet testify, but only to answer questions from the judge, not from plaintiff's lawyers.

After a short recess, Wagner returned to the hearing room and ruled that CPUC had met its initial burden of proof--akin to finding probable cause in a criminal trial.

"I do find that the complainant has made a prima facie case and the burden of proof now shifts to El Paso," Wagner said. When El Paso's lawyers tried to respond, Wagner ordered them to "please be seated."

Wagner said he was disturbed by transcripts of conversations taped in February 2000 between Robin Cox, an official of El Paso Merchant, and Harvey Rodman, an official of yet another El Paso subsidiary, Mojave Pipeline Co.

Cox was seeking a shipping discount from Mojave a few days before Merchant finalized its bid. The Mojave pipeline would provide an alternative route into Southern California in case of shipping bottlenecks.

Securing the Mojave discount made the El Paso contract more valuable for Merchant, the plaintiffs allege. In one taped conversation, Cox asks Rodman to refrain from publicly posting the discount for a few days. Plaintiffs allege that other shippers might have competed with Merchant for El Paso's capacity had they known a discount was available on Mojave.

But Merchant official Mark Mitchell testified that the Mojave discount was of no real importance in the company's decision to enter into the deal.

The judge wanted to know more. He urged El Paso Corp. to produce Cox and Rodman as witnesses.

"If ever a deal was being made . . . the words are clear," said Wagner. "It's all buddy-buddy stuff."

The judge said he was concerned that the Cox-Rodman conversations violated FERC rules that require pipelines to maintain arm's-length relationships with marketing affiliates.

CPUC attorney Harvey Morris, who has spearheaded the case against El Paso, said the judge's ruling made it clear that Merchant obtained preferential treatment.

Morris said he was baffled that El Paso chose not to bring on more witnesses, despite the judge's warning.

"If I were in their shoes," said Morris, "unless I had something to hide, I'd call my witnesses and give them another chance to defend themselves."

Responded William Scherman, a lawyer for Merchant: "You make a judgment that you have produced evidence that is sufficient to win your case, and we believe we have done that."

Price gouging case strong, judge says
El Paso Corp. executives decline to testify -- hearing cut short

A federal regulatory judge buoyed California's hopes for a major refund on energy costs yesterday when he said the state had presented credible evidence that a giant Texas natural gas company broke the rules against favoring an affiliate.

Curtis L. Wagner, the chief administrative law judge for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said lawyers for the state had made a convincing case that the El Paso Corp. acted improperly. He urged El Paso executives to rebut the allegations.

But they declined, bringing an unexpectedly sudden end to the evidentiary hearing in Washington, D.C., and boosting the spirits of California officials who have asked the regulatory commission to order El Paso Corp. to refund up to $200 million.

Wagner plans to file a recommended decision to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by Oct. 9.

At issue is an allegation by the state Public Utilities Commission that El Paso rigged the bidding for use of its natural gas pipeline in Southern California last year. The PUC said El Paso steered a huge block of crucial pipeline space to its own marketing affiliate, effectively freezing out competitors.

The PUC, utilities, say that El Paso's pipeline division and its marketing arm then cooperated to choke off the flow of gas to the state, setting off increases in the price of natural gas -- as well as in the price of electricity from gas-fired power plants.

Wagner said internal El Paso memos and transcripts support the first part of the state's allegations: that El Paso violated federal regulations that prohibit coordination between regulated natural gas pipelines and their unregulated affiliates, which are required to operate independently.

"The California Public Utilities Commission had shown a prima facie case, and the burden of proof shifted to the other side," Wagner told The Chronicle yesterday. "Now I have to look at the whole record and decide the case."

El Paso denies the allegations that it improperly shared information about the bidding process with the marketing affiliate and arranged discounts.

Top executives, including El Paso Corp. chief executive officer William Wise, had flown to Washington to testify at Wagner's suggestion.

"I told them what I thought they needed to do to show there was no affiliate abuse or no (market manipulation)," Wagner said. But he said the company had the right to cut the hearing short and rely on the evidence already presented. "That's up to them."

Whatever penalties the commission might impose, they could be dwarfed by damages sought in a series of private ratepayer lawsuits against El Paso. Those suits claim the company is largely responsible for billions of dollars in skyrocketing energy costs suffered by Californians over the past 18 months..


AMOUNTS TO CONCESSION
The decision to keep executives off the witness stand yesterday amounted to a concession that El Paso violated Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regulations against affiliate abuse, asserted PUC attorney Harvey Morris.

"I infer from their actions it was not going to get any better (if executives testified)," Morris said. "They were doing damage control."

El Paso spokeswoman Norma Dunn denied that the company has conceded wrongdoing.

"That's absolutely insane," said Dunn.

Wagner said transcripts of a telephone conversation between an employee of El Paso's marketing arm, El Paso Merchant Energy, and one of its pipeline affiliates "tend to show there was communication between the marketing agency and the pipeline." The two were discussing discounts.

"It looked like hanky-panky," Wagner said. The judge said he was also influenced that a memo outlining El Paso Merchant Energy's strategy for boosting profits from its pipeline contract was shared with the top executive for the company's pipeline division.

Barry,

The rate plan all of you are on is 89.99 for 650 nationwide anytime minutes.

Name	Monthly Average of Minutes	Suggestions	
Barry Tycholiz	450	Lower rate plan to 69.99 (550 minutes)	
Kim Ward 	650	Keep rate plan	
Stephanie Miller	300	Lower rate plan to 49.99 (350 minutes)	

RATE PLANS	
$ 29.99	$ 39.99	$ 49.99	$ 69.99	$ 99.99	$ 149.99	$ 199.99	
100 min.	175 min.	350 min.	550 min.	900 min.	1500 min.	2000 min	

Any extra charges you see on the bill, doesn't mean they are getting charged for roaming/long distance.  They most likely include:  411 calls, accessories, or exceeding minutes.

I will get back to you with how much is being spent in Denver.

Jessica, it appears that we pay a monthly fee of $ 89.99 / mth plus monthly optional charges and all long distance and local charges.  I would like to discuss the details of a bill. What is this base fee, are there other plans available? Are we getting any value in using cingular ( especially this plan). How many minutes are we getting what are the  long distance and roaming rates? 

In aggregate, my monthly cell phone bill for my group looks to be around $1,400 - $ 2,000/mth for 7 people total and this is a little high. 

Also, pls verify who has cell phones in Denver and what the monthly bills look like for this office.

Thanks, BT

We are in the process of redesigning our application of the fundamentals in our  sales/coverage programs.  We are moving to a much more formal process and your needs dovetail nicely with ours.  We will want to make sure that we are utilizing the best available information in our sales programs so I look forward to working with you on this in a close manner.  We will try to get you what you need and make it a priority.

If you are unaware of this, I have put placed in charge of the fundamentals for the Northwest, Rockies, and Southwest on the desk.  Matt and Steve are currently working on the Northwest and Monique is working on the Southwest.

I am in desperate need of some help on the Rockies as this is the largest fundamental task we have to present in the West, including California in my opinion.  I want to make a full presentation to the group next Wednesday of the complete Rockies picture.  I have already done a lot of work on this, but I am in need of additional information and help.

Paul...we have already talked about load.  I need to know by Monday whether or not we can get numbers from PSCO.  If so, I need them on Monday.  If we can't, I understand the problems with that and I will go forward with what I have.

Tyrell...you seem to have the best handle on production numbers in the Rockies.  Could you please update your production numbers out through the winter.  If you can get your hands on any historical production data showing trends that would be great.  I was thinking that maybe we could ask some of the producers we have done deals with to  give us their production history back to last September or October.  Also, if you have any good information on decline curves (especially the difference between CBM in Powder and the deeper wells in other areas) I would love to include that.

Theresa...can you talk to Trailblazer, CIG, WIC and get the latest on any significant capacity increases (including quantities and schedules) through the middle of next year.  The major thing is the Trailblazer expansion...are they on time...what is the timing...what is the exact volume coming online...etc.  Also, if they know of any major maintenance issues over the next several months I would like to know them.

I know I am asking for quite a bit in a short period of time, but you can also see that there is no way that I can do all this myself plus everything else I am trying to work on.  Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.  I would like to have all this information to me by midday Tuesday at the latest.  Call me with any questions or comments.

Thank you,

Jay

Howard, can you please verify what you mean by renewal rights.. specifically who owns what rights and until which period.

It is my expectation that with the exception of CNRL, ENA/ECC holds the obligation and annual renewal rights on Nova, ANG. We have assigned the PGT permanently out of Nov 08 to Calpine and Sierra Pacific.. We also have the obligation to give them the matching upstream capacity at that time.

Also, where do you think AEC, Talisman and CNRL will be to take permanent assignment of this pipe effective asap... thus changing the deal delivery point around..( an the credit situation). 

Included in the shuffle will be the liquids obligations, nominations, ( ENA /ECC can still act as the agent) but most importantly the thing we need to transfer over is the pipe obligation on PGT..... stat !!! 
 
Pls advise.

Hi Barry!
I was getting ready to email you. Yes, I will be at the game on Mon. night.
I am coming with my friend Linda. She is from Denver. Her parents live
about an hour away. We are going to her parents on Sat. and then coming
into the city on Sun. I got an email from Brian and told him I would be
coming in and it would be great to hook up with you guys before the game. I
have both of your cards. Brian's doesn't have a cell on it, but I see yours
does. I sent him my cell number already. It is 310-346-3086. I'm not sure
where our seats will be since they are from the Giants ticket pool. Just
let us know which local watering hole we can expect to find you!

See you soon!
Debra

As some of you might already know, I resigned today.  I feel fortunate and blessed to have had this experience here at Enron.  Not only have I learned a tremendous amount, but I also have met some very talented and unique people.  I am not 100% sure what I will do at this point, but I will probably be heading up to NYC in January.  I feel sad to end this chapter, yet excited as I begin a new one in my life.  

As always, it has been a pleasure working with you!  Keep in touch.  I will be interested to see what happens.

4.  The Peoples Gas Light and Coke Company - Found an old Columbia Energy Marketing and Consolidated Natural Gas Company.  No MAC termination clause and no termination payment calculation.  If party fails to perform then other party can seek damages.

Are we all set for August?  Do our schedulers know how this will work?  Let's talk with Patti about this transport.

Subject: Kern River Transportation Management - Aug 1


As a reminder...EFFECTIVE AUG 1. ENA has appointed Nevada Power / Sierra Pacific as our agent for the term of the transportation agreement. What this means is that NP will nominate the supply gas into the pipeline and deliver to themselves as they are the market for the whole volume and term. ENA will have to instruct NP what our supply looks like ( on a daily basis) 
 
We have sold all the Kern gas to SPPC for the entire period.... at a Socal Monthly Index minus $.42/$.95 related price and our obligation is 100% takes.
 
I know some supply has been purchased for the term but some gas will be procured in the spot market.  I expect that Steve South and Paul Lucci will coordinate those efforts as required but we need this gas to show up every day.  
 
Let me know if there are any questions regarding this note... but primary supply and market obligations are in the hands of the trading group. 
 
Thanks, BT

Stephanie:

I attach a copy of the presentation we gave to Eric Gonzales last week.  Based on our analysis and the information we received from yourself and gas traders here and in Portland, we made certain assumptions about how the NW Pipeline system works.  During our planned meeting on Friday (we will learn for sure whether the meeting is taking place only on Wednesday -- Kirk Morgan will be reporting for jury duty that day and will let us know whether he's released or not), we wanted to confirm that our conclusions are correct, whether the LNG terminal idea is completely crazy and whether there are any synergies that we may get from working with NW P/L and/or Williams on LNG terminal development.

Please let me know what you think,

Z

Sounds good.  You can reach me at 415.782.7822.  Because my schedule is a mess (thanks to the mess California has created), if you don't reach me on my office line, please try 415.505.6633.  Also, I think that it would be very useful to have Leslie Lawner on, since she's involved a lot in California gas matters, but it's your call.  Just let me know.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff, for the meeting on Thurs a.m.  9:30 ( Houston Time ), we should keep our group to the list I have identified. I would like to start with a simple plan and work out from there. We are working towards an action plan for handling PUC issues ( from a commercial perspective) in california and other states, prior to anybody addressing the PUC we need agreement as to what it is we want to put forward. 

We will call you on thurs a.m.  Can you please verify your contact phone number.  

Thanks in advance. 

Jessica, pls reserve a room.

Importance:=09High

Salt River Project, in an effort to bring resolution to the mainline and
receipt point allocation issues pending in the above-captioned proceedings,
is filing today (and serving hard copies of) the attached "Motion of SRP fo=
r
Adoption of Strawman Alternative to March 28, 2000 Proposal of El Paso
Natural Gas Company".  Unlike any other proposal before it, it seeks to
weave into one workable solution, the concerns raised by shippers in their
initial and reply comments filed in the Order 637 proceeding, as well as
address the 3 complaints.  It is a share-the-pain proposal among CD -
Converted FR - and El Paso.  Under it, FR shippers would convert to CDs at
levels reflecting actual usage over the past 5 years, weighted to the
present. It assures each westward flowing firm shipper, based on the curren=
t
physical mainline capacity (including L. 2000), 93.1%(winter) and 94.2%
(summer) of their contractual entitlement.  On a daily basis, all westward
FT shippers are assured of receiving approximately 60% of their 93.1 and
94.2% allocation from the San Juan.  FT-2 shippers would continue to be
served off the top.  This Strawman adopts the in-line pooling methodology
set forth in SoCal Gas' initial comments.  It includes North and South
system segmentation rights, and narrowly defined demand charge credits for
unprovided capacity as long as there is a shortfall.  Provision is made to
encourage turn-back of capacity and to have capacity under expired contract=
s
dedicated by El Paso to meeting the approximately 7% shortfall. Provision i=
s
also made to treat each primary delivery point as a receipt point, and to
give priority to Alternate Receipt- to- Primary Delivery point in the
systemwide scheduling process, all intended to encourage a strong
supplemental market to meet peak seasonal needs.

This Strawman Alternative is not filed as an offer of settlement, but as a
basis for a merits decision, eliminating the need for lengthy evidentiary
hearings, and providing certainty and flexibility to the system once
implemented.  Alternatively, we have left it to the Commission to decide
whether other procedures should be adopted.  Because it is a motion, it may
be responded to within 15 days of filing.  SRP strongly urges each shipper
and state commission to contact SRP for answers to any questions before
taking a position in response to the motion.  Any shipper that has question=
s
but does not seek answers, but merely sticks to their litigation position
will only be delaying resolution. This proposal is a viable
compromise...everyone gains and everyone loses something.  That is why it
works.  We look forward to hearing from you and reading your constructive
comments.  Joel Greene

In consideration of the sensitivities regarding this asset and ENA's efforts to manage this risk. I believe we need to formalize and coordinate any external communication with El Paso.

Please advise by name who your lead contact is or would be and what the general purpose of the conversations is concerning.  If you do not have a primary contact or do not talk directly to the pipeline, pls advise.

Subject:	More Info: PG&E to Announce Open Season on Redwood and Baja Early Next Week

PG&E will announce via press release very early next week an open season on Redwood, Baja and Silverado.
It comes in direct response to recent announcements of expansions into California by pipelines.
The bid protocols will be structured similar to original open season from the original Gas Accord.
The open season will start on June 1 and end on July 31.
Capacity will be available starting 1.1.03.
Bidders will be able to bid up to 30 years (PG&E states that that's what generators want).
Accompanying the announcement will be another announcement that PG&E will expand Redwood by 200mmcf/day, which they hope to have available by 1.1.03, or some time during Q103.
About 2-4 weeks after the open season begins, PG&E will file its proposed "Gas Accord II,"  (the first one expires end of 02).
As part of that filing, PG&E will offer its proposed ratemaking treatment for the next five years (beginning 1.1.03).
PG&E will not include in the open season 1) core capacity and 2) certain EAD contracts that extend beyond the Gas Accord 1 end date.
In addition, PG&E will hold back an additional 20% (after excluding core and EAD), to be "open-seasoned" at some "future" date.
The capacity to be auctioned is: 1) 900 mmcf/day on Redwood, 2) 245 (annual) on Baja, plus an additional 200/day in summer on Baja, 3) 155 on Silverado.
How PG&E will market the 20% they intend to hold back, and when they might auction it off in the future will be discussed in PG&E's Gas Accord II filing.
No single company will be awarded more than 30% of the capacity on any specific path in the primary open season (though firms can bid whatever level of capacity they choose).

Please forwad along to anyone else who might be interested.  If you have any questions, just holler.

Best,
Jeff

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Louise

In consideration of the sensitivities regarding this asset and ENA's efforts to manage this risk. I believe we need to formalize and coordinate any external communication with El Paso.

Please advise by name who your lead contact is or would be and what the general purpose of the conversations is concerning.  If you do not have a primary contact or do not talk directly to the pipeline, pls advise.

Please let me know how we can help.  We have alot of experience in Wyoming and have invested in excess of $150 Million in pipeline assets in the state over the last 2 years.  ENA has since divested them to Northern Border but we remain very involved in the day to day operations and manage all of the commodity services associated with those assets.

For clarification, we have had numerous discussions with the Feds (BLM) regarding the federal royalties take in kind program and see applications for similiar structures with the State royalties.  In addition we have several ideas regarding potential projects that would/could benefit the state.

You can reach me at 303-575-6473.

Paul,

Welcome back.  The Wyoming Governor's office wants to meet in August re energy issues.  I have identified the appropriate Enron nat gas people.  I would recommend a conference call with your Wyoming contact in advance of that meeting to determine if it makes sense to fly a lot of people to Wyoming.  Mark Whitt is based in Denver and focuses on nat gas marketing.  I believe he has had some discusions in the past with Wyoming re their royalty positions and will likely call to discuss. 

Scott Josey runs our producer finance business which finances/invests in upstream producers and projects.  He has some clients that may be interested in expanding a Wyoming position.

Let me know how you would like to proceed.

Barry, I understand you have some reservations about my involvement with L-P's request for assistance to financially hedge their natural gas exposure.  I have no problem working with Dave Fuller as I did regarding another entity or with whomever from your group regarding this matter, as long as I am financially rewarded for my time and efforts.  As you will see for the attached letter from L-P, I have put a great deal of time and effort into positioning Enron as L-P's preferred ESP to the point of being asked to join their internal energy team.  If you would please advice me how you'd like to proceed and we'll take it from there.  Thanks,  John

Barry,

In spite of the news in the media about Enron, I see
opportunity. Since we've communicated last I've been real
busy selling my services to major energy traders. Actually
Enron is one of the traders that have my company listed as
one of three or four minority businesses that will be
involved with supplying the power for contracts. These
contracts start at $100,000,000 and go up.

Barry, I'm going to forge ahead, but I'd still rather have
the opportunity to work and learn from the biggest and
best.
One of my strong points is to get the deal done, another is
to understand my limitations. If you give me the shot on
the origination side you'd be most pleased. If I can
convince the world's largest energy trader to put me on
their contracts and RFPs after being in business for less
than a year, just think what could be done with a
supportive back office and timely information.

What I'm seeking is a chance to excel with all the tools at
my disposal. Drop me a email and tell me your thoughts.

Tyrone Killebrew

Barry,

Could you go through the attached list and identify which of your customers in column B correspond to the names in column D?  There may be no match in column D.  If so, please indicate as such.

This is part of the project with structuring and credit to identify which of our customers have master firm and master swap agreements in place.  Credit has a number of different subsidiaries in its database, and these subsidiaries do not necessarily correspond to the customer names in our own database.  

Thanks, and let me know if you have any questions.

Phil

Subject:	Re: STatus of PGT and CIG

1.	CIG, RP01-350
CIG  has filed an answer to the comments and protests.  Although they referenced our protest, they did not discuss it in any detail except to say that our issues and those of PSCo and Barrett could be explored through "normal procedures" after the suspension, presumably through settlement conferences or hearing.  Note that I gave you a copy, though I can't remember exactly when.  It might have been when we met with Paul in my office.

The suspension order was issued on 4/25 -- rates effective 10/1/01, subject to refund.  Copies were distributed to parties on my list on 4/30.  All of the issues in the "Appendix B" tariff sheets are set for the technical conference (basically, everything except the rates and cost of service, which are to be addressed at hearing).  The hearing schedule is held in abeyance until after the technical conference issues are resolved.  At that point, a procedural schedule will be established, with a target hearing date and dates for testimony, discovery, rebuttal testimony, etc.  Of course, settlement negotiations will also be going on at the same time, I would assume.

2.	PGT, CP01-141

The application was filed on 4/2, and interventions/protests were not due until 4/25.  As you know, certificate proceedings do not have the same requirement for FERC to act within 30 days.  Environmental issues will be of primary concern initially.  On 4/12, FERC issued a notice of intent to prepare an Environmental Assessment with reqeust for comments.   FERC sent PGT a data request on environmental issues, to which PGT responded on 4/30.  Interestingly, on 5/3, REBOUND, an organization of skilled construction trade workers, filed a letter arguing that a "full and complete" Environmental Impact Statement is the proper avenue for consideration of the environmental impacts of the project.  An EIS is much more extensive than an Environmental Assessment.  REBOUND's justification for an EIS didn't seem to be very strong.  

While the environmental work is ongoing, FERC will probably issue a preliminary determination on the non-environmental issues.  If RIMS is correct, there weren't many protests -- only us, DEK Energy Company, and Pan Alberta Gas -- and only PanCanadian Petroleum filed comments.

Hi Mr. Tycholiz,

My name is Tamara and I work with Judy on the Enron program here at
PricewaterhouseCoopers.  I have been looking over your file and have a
question with regard to the fax which you sent to us on August 29, 2001.
There may have been a misunderstanding regarding the intention of you
faxing those documents to us.  We looked at the fax and understood it to be
for our files.  However, from your most recent email, we are now thinking
that you had expected us to take some kind of action on your behalf with
the IRS.

The original notice from the IRS is dated June 23rd, 2001.  It states that
should you not agree with their figures, you should contact them.  We
assumed that you did not agree with the notice and had contacted them.  Our
question is: did you contact the IRS and/or send in the forms with your
wife's SSN or was it action that we were meant to take?  If you could
please clarify this at your earliest convenience, we will try to get this
resolved as soon as possible.

We estimated 27,700 (including 3,000 for airfare for Enron people)
We spent 25, 096 (not including airfare or fishing or anything that was put on credit cards)

I will need to get an actual cost for the airfare and anything that was expensed to be able to give you a complete cost of the event.  I will contact Jessica to get this information from her.  I will then include it and send it back to you.

The bill has not been paid. As soon as I got it I put the list together for you.   I am sending it to accounts payable to get paid tomorrow.

I'll get everything to you as soon as I get it.

Mara, 

Attached is the spreadsheet for billing Palo Alto.  I think that everything we need for billing purposes is there, we just need to improve it and make it user friendly.  We will provide this spreadsheet to accounting by the 10th of each month for the previous flow month. therefore, once we get August done, we will need to work on September.  Once you've had a chance to look at it, we can discuss.  Also, I have a notebook at my desk that details everything about Palo Alto.  

Thanks,

Kim

These comments on FERC's proposed gas reporting requirements are due on June 18.  The draft takes the position that the FERC should NOT adopt reporting requirements for natural gas sellers, which is a different approach than some of you had discussed earlier.  If after reading my very persuasive comments, the consensus is we should not oppose the reporting requirements but rather attempt to water them down, I will of course rewrite the comments (or resign in protest).

On page 6, I make the argument that we do not do our business in the manner the reporting requirements seem to contemplate.  I go through a very high level description of our "books," but I really do not want to be more specific, as we then get into proprietary matters.  Where we have given FERC the more detailed description, we have asked for confidential treatment.

Please get comments back to me and Becky as quickly as you can.  Thanks.

Subject:	Fantastic Friday/Super Saturday Interviewers

As you all know, the recruiting season is in full swing and the AA Program's recruiters are hitting campus as we speak.  One of the most important parts of the process and a key to Enron's future success are the Fantastic Friday and Super Saturday interview dates where we make the selections on those candidates who will receive offers from Enron for the 2002 recruiting class.  It is important that these candidates be interviewed by business leaders from each business unit and specifically those who utilize AA pool members.  Our goal is for each business unit to identify a core group of interviewers for each of the four interview weekends which will be held as follows:

		Dates						Total Number of Interviewers Needed**

October 25-26           Fantastic Friday - Analysts			100		30 for dinner/70 for interview        
November 2 -4 -        Super Saturday - Associates		100		30 for dinner/70 for interview		
November 15-16        Fantastic Friday - Analysts			100		30 for dinner/70 for interview
November 30-Dec 1   Super Saturday - Associates		100		30 for dinner/70 for interview

I have attached a list of those individuals in various business units that have participated in the interview process in the past for your review (as a sample of the type of individual we are looking for as interviewers).  Please provide me a list of your business unit's interviewers by date by Friday, October 5.  Individuals are encouraged to interview more than one selected date and we will forward details to them at least a week prior to the interview date.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to give me a call.  Thanks again for all your help.  Ted and Traci

 
**  We do not expect you to provide all the interviewers.  This number reflects to total needed from all business units and will include those needed for both the evening and interview days..

Bill -

I have attached a breakdown of our gas inventories by location.  The valuations have not been updated to take into account the downward move in gas prices.  

When we meet with you here in Purchase we would like to this to be one of the topics of discussion.  If you need any additional information (or more detail), please let me know asap.

Thanks.
Are you having any further luck on a counterparty for this IT from Williston/Rockies.
The PG&E legal guy is out this weeek!  Powell has had a call in since last week - no answer.  Perhaps they could have told us...  I waited for that contact before calling Ray.  Let you know.

What's the view on Nymex that you're getting down there - one month, winter, summer.   Thanks.

PS - Suncor/Sunoco 3 yrs verbal - I'll send you a copy of the note.

Timely note, and once again I am already hard at work prospecting for you up here.
They are getting ready to drill CBM this fall. I've been meeting with them on this and actually set them up to do a deal with ATS on production/revenue/lease acctg in the US (next mtg Oct 9 in Calgary).  I gave them a presentation a few weeks ago on the general things we and ATS can do for them in Denver/Dallas.  I want to send them something more specific about all we can do in the Rockies on the gas mktg side.  I'll also build in some data on Hanover for them so will draw that from Producer One.
Can I get some general slides about all the good things Mark and the gang do in Denver.
Timing is next few days.  I'd like to get this to them by sometime Friday if possible (not the end of the world if it's early next week). 
Thanks.

Key Enron Employees Aren't Jumping Ship, Recruiters Say
Dow Jones International News Service via Dow Jones
By Michael Rieke Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES
HOUSTON (Dow Jones)--Enron Corp.'s (ENE) current problems aren't sending its
key employees running for the door, according to two executive recruiters.
While employees at Enron's underperforming units are shopping around for new
jobs, those working for its core wholesale energy trading and retail energy
units seem content, the recruiters told Dow Jones Newswires.
"We've been getting resumes from their international group over the last
year," said Bruce Peterson, managing director for Korn Ferry in Houston.
"But its been a very well-known fact that they're getting out of those
businesses."
Another Houston recruiter, who didn't want to be identified, said he has
gotten "a flood" of resumes from employees at Enron's natural gas and power
assets in South America.
Employees at Enron's broadband unit are also sending out resumes, said the
recruiter. That business has brought the company losses of more than $100
million this year despite hundreds of layoffs. Enron continues to cut costs
in its telecom business.
Neither recruiter has seen many resumes from Enron's big moneymakers - the
wholesale energy trading group and the retail energy services group.
Some of the lower-level employees of those units have sent out resumes but
Peterson said he hasn't seen higher-level executives in the job market.
However, he attached a caveat to that statement.
"Quite a few of the senior people at Enron have left over the last 6-12
months," he said.
When Enron's share price was flying high last year and early this year, some
of Enron's top executives cashed out their stock options and left the
company.
Those executives included Cliff Baxter, former vice chairman and chief
strategy officer; Ken Rice, former head of Enron Capital and Trade as well
as former chief executive of Enron Broadband Services; Kevin Hannon, former
president of Enron Broadband Services; and Lou Pai, former chairman and
chief executive of Enron Energy Services.
The lure of cashing out lucrative stock options won't cost Enron any more
employees any time soon. The company's share price has fallen too far too
quickly, leaving the options underwater.
The company's shares traded as high as $80 early this year. By July the
price had dropped to around $50, leaving employees with options that were
virtually worthless. So Enron told employees it would issue new options in
August.
But the company's share price continued to fall as more and more bad news
came out. The new options issued in August, when the share prices were
around $40, are now underwater also.
Now that the options are out of the money, Enron employees are more
vulnerable to the lure of other companies, Peterson said.
Enron could face another problem in keeping key people. Its employees work
under two-year contracts. If they leave Enron before their contracts
expires, a noncompete clause could prevent them for working for a
competitor.
Some of those contracts will expire at the end of the year. Without the
incentive of lucrative stock options, Enron might have a difficult time
getting employees to agree to new contracts with a noncompete clause,
Peterson said.
An Enron spokeswoman said the company isn't planning to issue more new
options to employees.

Got Mark's number.  I'm going to call him today.  Any specific info you'd like to have, or just generally what he and DWR are up to on the gas side.  I also assume that we'd like to meet with him to discuss possible opportunities?

Davette,

We need to credit Barry Tycholiz (P # 564185) with 40 hrs extra vacation time.  His offer letter said that he would receive an additional 40 hrs vacation.  He has not yet been credited with the extra hrs.  He should be receiving a total of 160 hrs vacation.  Please let me know when this has been completed.

Thanks,
Ben

The following is a summary of the estimated costs of our buildout/subdivide project:

Blueprints	$6,000
Construction	$70,000
Furniture	$3,000
Voice/Data	$4,000 	
*Commisions	$16,000

*Commisions were negotiated by Enron Realty

We had a profit of roughly $70,000 on the sublease over the term of the lease and will save approximately $11,000 per month on the sublease.

Good morning Barry:

I am attaching a copy of my updated resume.  I am looking forward to meeting with you to discuss any possible opportunities that you may have in your group.  I began the Analyst Program in July and have been working in Generation Investments under Carl Tricoli.  The experience has been tremendous thus far.  We discovered last week that our group is being restructured and I am forced to look for re-deployment.  Thank you for time and consideration.

Tyrell,

The following is the information that we have been provided thus far
regarding your questions below.  If the merger between Enron and Dynegy
closes, all terms and provisions of the option awards before the close are
preserved through and after the close except:

(1) number of options in Dynegy will be number of Enron options before the
merger times the merger ration of .2685

(2) the strike price for Dynegy options will be the strike price of Enron
options before the merger divided by the merger ration of .2685

The proposed transaction is considered an "approved" change in control for
purposes of the Enron Corp. stock plans.

I hope this helps with some of the questions.  If you have further questions
that I have not answered I would refer you back to Enron for clarification.

What happens to the Enron options after the merger?
Are all options vested upon completion of the merger?
What happens to the number of options and the strike price, given the
ratio of 1 share of ENA = .2685 share of DYN?

Thanks in advance for your help.

As you know, the Enron Management Conference will be held Wednesday through Friday, November 14-16, 2001, at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio, Texas.  

This has been an eventful and challenging year for Enron.  Now,  more than ever,  it is fitting to bring Enron's leaders together.  After all, it is up to our management team to lead our company through these challenging times.  Together, we will define Enron's character and determine Enron's destiny.

We have a great program planned for this year's conference.  I'm delighted that General Norman Schwarzkopf will join us as a keynote speaker on leadership.  I'm equally pleased to welcome back Gary Hamel, who will help us process the past year and prepare for future success.  As I've said before, we are a company that continues to look to the future, and there are many exciting things in store for us.

I look forward to seeing you at this very important meeting.

Regards,
Ken Lay

Just got off the phone with Rick Hawley--Puget's CFO.  He was very cordial and indicated the company was interested in talking with us.  We had a fairly open discussion of who we should contact.  In the end, he suggested that we call Bill Gaines, VP Energy Supply.  He said that as CFO he is head of the Risk Management Committee and that anything that was discussed with Bill would go through his committee.  I highlighted the notion that we were interested in talking about services that could be helpful to their risk management efforts and that would be beneficial to both of our companies.  

By the way, at the beginning of the call, I made clear that we were not talking about total outsourcing.  

He didn't immediately respond, but in the context of our discussion re:  who to talk to he stated that we should talk to him if we wanted to have a more strategic discussion on outsourcing.  Then he said something to the effect of "of course, we're not at all interested in a more comprehensive outsourcing product."

Bill's number is 425.462.3145.  He said that we can tell Bill, Rick suggested we call him directly.

The enclosed spreadsheet contains data extracted from PGT's semi-annual fuel
tracker filings which might be of interest.  It is possible PGT might claim
the increasing fuel cost parts of your intervention as "unsubstantiated" and
therefore should be excluded and ignored by the Commission.
 <<PGTfuel.xls>>

There could well be a case for roll-in.  If there is, PGT didn't include it
in their filing.  I guess we will see how it all shakes out.  It's
interesting no-one has yet asked FERC to require a new rate case by a
specific date or to force the trivial rate reduction through to Shippers.

Estimate of marginal/incremental fuel consumption due to new capacity:

NEW CONTRACTS
210,800 dt; 612.46 mi => 	(210,800)/(1 -0.0050%*612.46)*(612.46) =
133,185,095 dt-miles/day
  20,380 dt; 612.46 mi =>	(20,380)/(1 -0.0050%*612.46)*(612.46) =
12,876,244 dt-miles/day

				annual average (5 mo winter, 7 mo summer) =
138,550,197 dt-miles/day

BASE CASE, FULL EXISTING SYSTEM
1.385 e9 dt-miles/day, useage of 68.6 Mdt/day, or 0.0050%/mile

MARGINAL FUEL PERCENTAGE ESTIMATE
0.0101 %/mile, slope of line from chart 'ex5' as computed on sheet 'regr'
Sheet 'ex8' has all the historical data points and their derivations.

Additional Fuel estimate
0.0101 %/mile * 138,550,197 dt-miles/day = 14.0 Mdt/day

Total Fuel Used
68.6 + 14.0 = 82.6 Mdt/day

Total Throughput
1.385 + 0.139 = 1.524 e9 dt-mi/day

Estimated resultant average fuel:
82.6 Mdt/day / 1.524 e9 dt-mi/day = 0.00542 %/mile.

Increase in average fuel to existing shippers
0.00542%/mile - 0.0050%/mile = 0.00042 %/mile
612.46 mi * 0.00042 %/mile = 0.257% on a Kingsgate-to-Malin path.
At $5.00 /dt, 0.257%*$5 = $0.013 /dt

Since the combined toll (cash toll plus fuel value) goes up, PGT must make a
case that roll-in is beneficial.



The previous filings by PGT that provide the historical data are:
12/22/93	RP94-88

----------

Fascism
You have two cows.
The government takes both, hires you to take care of them and sells you the
milk.

----------

Pure Communism
You have two cows.
Your neighbours help take care of them and you all share the milk.

----------

Applied Communism
You have two cows.
You must take care of them, but the government takes all the milk.

----------

Totalitarianism
You have two cows.
The government takes them both and denies they ever existed. Milk is banned.

----------

Pure Democracy
You have two cows.
You and your neighbours decide who gets the milk.

----------

Representative Democracy
You have two cows.
Your neighbours pick someone to tell you who gets the milk.

Mexican Democracy
You have two cows.
The government takes both and drafts you into the army.


----------

European Democracy
You have two cows.
The EU commission decides which regulations for feeding and milking apply.
If
there aren't any, they invent some. They pay you not to milk the cows.
They take both cows, shoot one, milk the other and pour the milk down the
drain.
They then require you to fill out forms accounting for the missing cows.


----------

American Democracy
The government promises to give you two cows, if you vote for it.
After the election, the president is impeached for speculating in cow
futures.
The press dubs the affair "cowgate," but supports the president.
The cows sue you for breach of contract.
Your legal bills exceed your annual income.
You settle out of court and declare bankruptcy.


----------


Capitalism
You have two cows.
You sell one and buy a bull.
Your herd multiplies, and the economy grows. You sell them and retire on the
income.


----------

Enron Venture Capitalism
You have two cows.
You sell three of them to your publicly listed company, using letters of
credit
opened by your brother-in-law at the bank, then execute a debt/equity swap
with
an associated general offer so that you get all four cows back, with a tax
exemption for five cows.  The milk rights of the six cows are transferred
via an
intermediary to a Cayman Island company secretly owned by the majority
shareholder who sells the rights to all seven cows back to your listed
company.
The annual report says the company owns eight cows, with an option on one
more.

Earlier this week, EES (Dave Delainey and Janet Dietrich) agreed the following with ENA:

- EES will continue to approach utilities/munis to sell their "whitepaper" concept, but will restrict their efforts to only the following, until such time as the concept is proven or abandoned:

	- City of San Antonio
	- City of Austin
	- Brownsville Public Utility Board
	- City of Anaheim
	- Peoples
	- SMUD
	- Silicon Valley (Santa Clara)
	- City of Memphis

- EES agreed that they should not be approaching industrials which fall within the previously established ENA SIC codes and committed to reigning their people in. It was agreed that EES would work with ENA to determine if there are subgroups within the SIC codes which are too small for ENA, but which EES should be covering. Chris Calger agreed to work with EES on determining this. The SIC Code categories which ENA is responsible for are as follows (note that while the categories have been agreed, the actual code numbers are my own interpretation of the categories):

10 - Primary Metals Mining and Extraction 
13 - Oil and Gas Extraction
26 - Paper and Forest Products
5169, 2899, 5191, 5169 - Chemicals - except for pharmaceutical, biotech and small specialty chemical that will be EES customers  (DOW Chemical)
2911 - Refining
29 - Petroleum and Coal Manufacturing
30 - Plastics and Rubber Manufacturing
5191 - Fertilizer
3531 - Rail
2891, 3559, 5094, 1422, 3241, 3297, 5032 - Cement
3274, 1422, 5191, 2041, 2869 - Large Agricultural Processing

Dan, I am interested.  I know that Sue Mara spoke with Ron on this subject also, although I was not on the call.  The matter was not discussed on our Western Wholesale call this morning either, since I did not become aware of it till later.  I would therefore like to receive input from Sue and others on our team about this, getting final sign off to proceed from Linda Robertson and Jim Steffes.  If we elect to proceed, it would be appropriate to bill all participating marketers in equal shares.  Thanks.  Ray

Governor wants to cut costs of power 
Tough sell for Davis as suppliers balk 
By Steve Geissinger
SACRAMENTO BUREAU 
SACRAMENTO -- With an economic "perfect storm" and an election looming, Gov. Gray Davis wants to renegotiate several of the state's expensive long-term power contracts -- a move that could translate into a big break for Californians. 
But the generators who signed the multibillion-dollar contracts to supply the state will be a tough sell on the notion, even though many have indicated they will at least listen to the state. 
"If the politicians were to make all these contracts go away, ... who the hell is going to meet with the state and negotiate any (new) contracts?" asked Peter Cartwright, president of San Jose-based Calpine Corp., a major supplier of California power. 
And many experts and analysts are skeptical about Davis' chances of getting generators to substantially lower the price of power they sell to the state, which, in turn, supplies California customers through various utilities. 
"Good luck!" former Republican Gov. Pete Wilson sarcastically declared upon hearing of the Democratic governor's plan. 
Davis, however, has suddenly thrust the idea of renegotiating some of the costly power-supply contracts to the center of a wildly complex tangle of fiscal, political and legal issues tied to the energy crisis, the ailing economy and their impact on the growing state budget deficit. 
The outcome could affect the pocketbooks of energy consumers and taxpayers alike for years, perhaps decades. 
"This could save billions of dollars," said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, one of the consumer groups that has embraced Davis' power contract renegotiation plan. 
Barry Goode, Davis' legal affairs secretary, said the administration is "not targeting every contract" because the pacts have been "extremely valuable in keeping the market stable." 
The governor's aides refused to reveal which generators they will approach or the arguments they intend to use on the companies, whose contracts don't require them to reopen negotiations with the state. 
The governor signed more than 50 long-term contracts -- worth more than $40 billion -- with about two dozen generators at the height of the energy crisis earlier this year. 
The state made short-term purchases to supply California after soaring wholesale prices shattered utilities, then entered the longer-term pacts that provide about a third of the state's power demands. The contracts range in duration from a few months to 20 years. 
Though the contracts provide power at an average $69 per megawatt-hour over the next decade, the current market has dropped to less than half that rate. And the contracts provide more electricity than the state needs at times, forcing California to sell the excess at multimillion-dollar losses. 
The long-term contracts, harshly criticized by Republicans seeking the GOP gubernatorial nomination, have become a political liability for Davis as he heads into a re-election bid next year. 
The liability is compounded due to the pacts' potential role in what experts at a recent economic summit at Stanford University termed a brewing "perfect storm" of fiscal calamities. 
The state Public Utilities Commission, principally citing a desire for less costly power, has refused to allocate a revenue stream -- generated from recent electricity rate hikes and anticipated bond proceeds -- to finance the long-term contracts. 
The standoff has pitted Davis and Democratic state Treasurer Phil Angelides against another of the state's most powerful Democrats, Senate leader John Burton of San Francisco, who sided with the Democratic-controlled PUC. 
Burton has called "for Californians to be freed from egregious, unreasonable and expensive provisions contained in these contracts." 
The deadlock is holding up a $12.5 billion bond sale intended not only to help fund California's future power costs but repay state coffers for the billions of dollars spent earlier this year on emergency, short-term electricity purchases. It would be the largest municipal debt sale in U.S. history. 
Without the bond issue, a projected general fund deficit of up to $14 billion next year could grow to a staggering $20 billion-plus, forcing Draconian cuts in essential government services, according to state finance officials. 
The projected deficit of up to $14 billion in California's annual budget of about $100 billion stems from lagging tax revenue in a cooling economy, further chilled by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the East Coast. 
Against the backdrop of fiscal woes, analysts said successful renegotiation of some long-term power contracts could conceivably wind up sparing Californians electricity rate hikes, tax increases or both. 
But some analysts are pessimistic, like Wilson. The former governor is widely blamed for legislation that triggered the energy crisis, and yet he in turn blames Davis for not acting quickly enough to head off power woes. 
The Western Power Trading Forum, a group representing suppliers and brokers, has made it clear generators will expect the state to give them something substantial in return for any changes in the pacts. Such incentives might include settling disputes over power buys or the state dropping lawsuits against suppliers. 
"We're not going to say no. We'd certainly sit down at the table with them and say, 'Let's see, maybe we can do this, maybe we can do that,'" said Calpine's Cartwright. 
If state officials simply broke some of their contracts, not only would penalties be "very, very severe," but also "they would have completely blown their credibility, and no one would negotiate with them," Cartwright said. 
His comments coincided with reports that Calpine's third-quarter profits more than doubled, despite a sharp drop in short-term electricity prices in California, one of its main markets. Analysts said Calpine's performance can be largely attributed to its long-term contracts with the state. 
Heller, one of the state's most vocal consumer advocates, said Davis "is right to look back at the environment in which these contracts were signed and demand that the power companies come to the table and renegotiate, or even throw out many of the contracts." 
"Last spring," Heller said, "power companies had a gun to the governor's head and, with staff that already had conflicts of interest, the administration signed some terrible deals."

I'd like to keep this confidential, but someone inside PG&E's gas group (for what it's worth) told me that participants will have a choice under PG&E's proposed extension of its Gas Accord.  Either the participant can retain the capacity for the term of the extension (less the cost escalators in the original deal) or release the capacity back to PG&E with no penalty.  I'll try to confirm that this is the view among most in PG&E.

Best,
Jeff

Stephanie, I have booked my flights to San Fransisco.  I will arrive on thurs aug 30 around 4:00 PM via continental. 

can you book meetings with Calpine, Jeff Dasovich, and PG&E ( we can discuss who at PG&E ).  We should also review the Sonoran shippers list and as part of this trip see some of these shippers who could use the PG&E recallable capacity (incl. Calpine).

I  am staying in California for the weekend so I can book meetings all day on friday.  Also, if you want to go out thurs a.m. and come back friday afternoon, that works for me also. please advise asap.

Subject:	LADWP Gas Contract


Dear Potential Gas Supplier

As some of you may know our authority to buy gas off our existing spot agreement
will come to an end on December 31, 2001.  While we will honor current
commitments for gas to be delivered after that date, but we will not be able to
use the spot agreement to buy any more gas.  The reason that this is happening
is that our City Attorney has interpreted the new City Charter as not allowing
delegations of authority such as employed in the way we buy gas now.

We are seeking approval for an ordinance which must be approved by the City
Council that will restore our former ability to buy gas with the kind of
agreement most gas suppliers are familiar.  We have the ordinance approved by
the City Attorney and it will shortly be in the pipeline for approval by our
Board and the City Council, but until then, this contract is a stop gap to keep
us operating.

I've attached the new contract and a cover letter which explains what we are
doing.  The deadline is November 8, 2001 at 4:00 PM.  We will take the executed
contracts to our Board with the counterparties listed on a Board Resolution and,
if it is approved, we will be allowed to buy gas from this group after the new
year begins.  This is not the ideal contract but one we feel our Board will be
comfortable with until we can get around the Charter problem.  I can't make any
changes to this contract.  There is a notice published in the LA Times about the
availability of the contract but I am sending it to you directly as someone we
have already done business with (and undoubtedly have satisfied all our
boilerplate requirements) and will probably be interested in what we are trying
to do here.

I Hope most of you will respond.  Thanks

Calif PUC To Pass Power-Bond Measures By Jan -Counsel

Nov. 1, 2001
LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- California utility regulators expect to approve a measure in January that will allow the state to sell $12.5 billion in bonds to repay the state's general fund and banks for power purchases made this year. 


Delays in the bond issue, originally planned for May, may deepen the state's budget deficit in the coming fiscal year and threaten to further tarnish the state's credit ratings. 


"At this point, we are aiming to have everything done by January related to the revenue bond sale," said Gary Cohen, general counsel for the California Public Utilities Commission. 


The PUC refused earlier this month to pass a so-called rate agreement, which would spell out how the bonds would be repaid, because it would give the the state's power buying arm carte blanche to raise electricity rates without public hearings and without oversight by the PUC. 


In addition, PUC President Loretta Lynch wants the governor's office to renegotiate the tens of billions of dollars in long-term power contracts it signed with more than a dozen energy companies at the peak of the market. One of the commission's objections to the rate agreement is that it would lock the state into overpriced, overlong deals that will saddle ratepayers with high electricity costs for the next decade. 


So far, neither the state nor the PUC have identified which power pacts they want to renegotiate. Spokesman for Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Williams Cos. (WMB) Calpine Corp. (CPN) and Sempra Energy Resources, a unit of Sempra Energy (SRE), have said they haven't been formally contacted by state officials to talk about renegotiating the deals. 


Williams and Dynegy said they would consider renegotiating the contracts, but only if the result would benefit both parties. Calpine said it would be difficult to rewrite the pacts, but the company is willing to talk with state officials. 


The PUC met with members of Gov. Gray Davis' staff last week to figure out a strategy for renegotiating the contracts, and talks are ongoing, Cohen said. 


"We are all in agreement that we want to renegotiate at least some of the contracts," Cohen said. "We have technical people looking at the contracts to figure out what we want to accomplish, what kind of portfolio we want in terms of duration and price. My view is we need to have a solid plan before we embark on renegotiations." 


Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for Davis, said the governor's office had no comment on the renegotiation talks.

Scott Yule advised that ANG system contracted for roughly 290 M2/day of new delivery capacity (210 to PGT & 80 to Southern Crossing). The Alberta system will expand by 222 M2/day plus an additional 37 M2/day for LRS 2 service. No capacity was relinquished. All of this is timed to come on line with the 2002 PGT expansion.

Can you tell from the queue that I forwarded to you -  What is the split between Shippers going to PGT versus Southern Crossing?

Thanks,
Stephanie

FERC today issued Draft Orders denying rehearing in the following:

Kern River, CP01-31 (2002 Expansion Project)
Rejected arguments of the Firm Customers that the project should not have been approved or, alternatively, the rights of the expansion shippers at Wheeler Ridge should be subordinate to those of the existing shippers.

PG&E Gas Transmission, NW, CP01-141 (2001 Expansion)
Rejected Newport Northwest LLC's assertion that requiring the expansion shippers to pay a fuel cost surcharge to recover any incremental fuel costs due to the additional compression approved for this project is contrary to FERC precedent and the policy statement on expansion facilities.

These orders should be issued within the next few days, and we will circulate copies.  Let Melinda know if you want to see the draft copies before then (they are not available electronically).

Jeff, did Mark H. sign off on us removing triangular set-off between affiliated entities.  We have removed the concept as instructed by Barry, but do not want to send to PG&E unless we have Mark's OK.

Also, Eric/Barry you were going to canvass Bill in terms of what he would require for Credit.

Peter.

I spoke with Dale Sanders at Williams today.  They seem very positive about the project at this point and have obviously spent a lot of money on right -of-way, regulatory filings, enviornmental and engineering work.  I had previously put this project at a very low probablility, especially with the 900 MM/d Kern expansion in 2003.  I did not think that they would be able to get Williams Marketing to take a substantial part of this capacity.  However, they are making the production company bear the costs of the capacity.  Obviously that is the key to Williams being able to have a shot at making this project a reality. 

Williams is in negotiaitions to fill the other 175,000 mmbtu/d.  I have to put that probability at still fairly low, but stranger things have happened, especially if Williams decides to go at risk for some portion of the 540 MM/d.  Probably the entire project is still less than 50% but it is obviously something to monitor very closely.

If the project gets built it will substantially effect the basis market for CIG and Northwest.  Especially on the heels of the Kern River expansion. In addition, the Cheyenne market will definitely strengthen in the back years.

Call if you want to discuss or have other ideas about how to monitor these developments.

Are they going to build it if it is not fully subscribed?  Or is Williams going to take the risk?  I wonder why Entergy is taking space?

Mark,

Steph said you were looking for some info on the Western Frontier project that was in NGI today.  I called the contact person at Western Frontier/Williams and he told me that the project was not in fact fully subscribed.  He was obviously interested in speaking with you again.  

I glanced through their filing, and apparently the open season led to PAs for 365,000 Dth/d of the 540,000 Dth/d of available capacity.  PA  have been signed with the following:

Marathon - 75,000 dth/d
Williams Marketing - 200,000 dth/d
Utilicorp United - 15,000 dth/d
Entergy - 75,000 dth/d

With the exception of Marathon, everyone signed up for ten years.  Marathon committed to five years, with an option to extend for two years.  

Let me know if you need anything else.

Phil

We have released our RFP for the pipeline capacity and Wallula tolling.  I
will be sending you an original copy via FEDEX, but wanted you to have the
enclosed copy for expediency.  I have also attached the heat balance diagram
(which is Attachment 3 to the Reverse RFP) so that your technical people can
have a basis to start from.  Attachments 1 and 2 you already have through
the PGT open season process, but we will include the version that we
executed in the FEDEX package.  Let me know if you have any questions.

     Barry: I will send a note to Jacy. Also the funds I think we will go 
     into are going to be more heavily weighted towards stocks, but will 
     have some bonds as well, that what makes them a balanced fund. Also, 
     do want us to manage the money Jacy has, or do you want to leave it 
     with him? No problem either way, just let me know.

I wasn't worried for a second.
     
I would like to have these funds in a portfolio that has a better 
performance than money markets. I already have a decent amount of money 
( 60K) in the Rice portfolio thru andrew agencies in Virden. You may 
want to look at exactly what that is, contact Jacy Whyte at Andrew 
Agencies... he will get you the details for Kim and I. 
     
Was there a particular index fund you had in mind? What do you mean by 
balanced ? Once we put it there I don't plan on touching or managing 
this until I return to Canada.  
     
Thanks, talk to you soon.

     You probably thought I had forgotten about you! I had not. I wanted
to 
     iron out some areas of concern from my end here. As you know, I am
not 
     supposed to do an investment for you while you are a resident of
the 
     US. I have discovered that if we put the money into an account and
not 
     make moves on it until you move back to Canada, then we can do it
if I 
     use a Canadian address. I was advised to put the money into a
balanced 
     fund and leave it there for now. My thoughts are to move it to a 
     couple of funds in a self administered account and NOT make any
moves 
     with it. 
     
     Please review this note, and let me know what you think. If all is
ok 
     I will mail you the forms to sign (which you signed here), and we
will 
     get this moving.
     
     Hope all is well with you down there.

John,

I was informed by Ron Whitehead that Les Rawson has arranged for Dave Fuller
to visit us on 6/13 to discuss natural gas opportunities.  (I mentioned that
we would be interested in this topic during my 5/4 visit.)

As you know, we attach significant value to having you as our one
point-of-contact with Enron - and we want to continue to work through you on
any new activities.  Given this, I am hoping that you will be available to
attend this meeting or that we can reschedule it so that you can be
available.

Please let me know if this is possible.

Dave, as you'll see our presentation was well received.  I've spoken to Roger a couple of times and next week they'll be meeting with "management" to obtain their approval of our concept, following that I'll be working on them to using Enron exclusively.  If we are successful, they will be expecting us to develop and manage the whole portfolio.  I appreciate your help and look forward to working together on this.  John

Well I appreciate the feedback.... I feel both Roger and Jeff liked and
understood the concept, but were concerned we "controlled" the number.   I
liken it to checking in the paper as to what the Prime interest rate is
prior to negotiating a home loan.  Once you know the relative interest
rate, you talk to a few mortgage bankers regarding points, services, etc.
and then move forward.  I would hope this is what L-P would do and
naturally I'd hope they would move forward with us.  John

Barry,

I had a long chat with Malowney and we agreed to work together on L-P, we're meeting them here on the 24th.  Regarding other industrials - I'm the gas guy. We're going to share contact lists and try to put forth a cohesive effort on the part of Enron, but I'm gas and he's power, L-P is an exception given their request that he be the contact (for now at least).  Make sense?

I'm very interested.  Can you put together a proposal?
Brian

>>> <Mark.Whitt@enron.com> 06/08/01 10:27AM >>>

I have been working on the San Juan deal we discussed.  The expansions
don't look very good.  Sonora Pipeline which is the Kinder
Morgan/Calpine
project is doubtful.  The rates on it look pretty good ($.39) but that
is
because they need subscriptions of  750 MM/d for 20 years.  It doesn't
seem
to feasible right now and they don't seem very confident in their
ability
to get it done.  The Transwestern expansion is only out of the Permian
basin so it won't fit and we believe that El Paso will be the same
although
that has yet to be determined.  However, it seems unlikely  that El
Paso
will expand out of the San Juan becuase their load growth is primarily
on
the south leg.

That is the bad news!  The good news is that we have existing space
that we
acquired on El Paso that began in June and continues through May of
2006.
Since the spreads have come in it is probably priced pretty well and I
believe we would give it to you at market.  We could structure it like
our
Wyoming deal in that we would manage the capacity and California
Border
sales for you.  I believe the space we have goes to PG&E.  The other
good
point is that you could control the ROFR in 2006.

Let me know if this is something you are interested in and I will work
up a
proposal for you.

Thanks

Mark

The memo was written requesting that the name of the trading book not reflect Denver any longer.  There are several technical issues involved with the IT group which could make this difficult.  It is being looked at to see if it can be changed.  The memo at least documented the fact that this inconsistency exists and may be enough to suffice for the time being.

Hey there Barry! No, I never heard from him. Guess I will drop him another
note and see how he is surviving this series! We actually went to get the
Av's in NJ. Lisa, Lynn, myself and another girl who is flying the Laker
trips with us got snagged to fly the trip since we were sitting around with
nothing to do until Sat. when we go to Philly. I guess they decided rather
than pay us for sitting on our butts they would put us to work! I am not
particularly fond of their players. Some of them are OK. Joe Sakic is nice.
And of course, I got to see Rob Blake which was a plus. He just doesn't
look right in that Av uniform, or sitting on the plane in a different seat
with all of those "other" guys around him! Patrick Roy sits in the seat he
use to sit in with the Kings, so I guess we know who won out on that deal!
I sure wouldn't ask him to get up! Yikes, he scares me! Now, Bob Hartley,
he is THE nicest guy! And not bad to look at either! All of the coaches are
nice, and quite amusing! Until they lost last night I was hoping to take
them back to NJ this week. How awsome would that have been to bring them
home with THE cup on the plane! Now that it isn't going to happen that way
it is just as well we are not going out there. I guess they found some
other charter FA's to handle it.

I am planning to go to Denver for the opening Bronco game on Mon. night
Sept. 10th. We may have to have a reunion! Are your buddies Bronco fans
too?

Take care, talk with you soon,

Debra

Jay is looking at updated financial information we received yesterday but I haven't heard from him.  Stacy is working on a Master Draft as well as the other documents we received from them.  Her ETA as of this morning is this afternoon.  Basically, jay is ok with using the GISB for up to three months if Stacy is ok with it.  He said that he would require a master for a 6 month transaction or longer.  

Will update you as soon as I get more info from Credit and Legal.

Mark, I'll look at the protest that Burlington and Amoco/BP filed and see if they raised any of the same issues.  I do know Pete Cervin, and I also know the Amoco attorney as well as the outside counsel who will be representing them.  If the FERC data base is up to date (not always the case), there weren't that many other parties who protested.  I'll check their filings, too.

If we decide to join with Burlington and Amoco/BP, we would probably need to sign some sort of agreement on splitting expenses for outside counsel and any consultants.  This would make it more difficult to back out so we'd need to be sure before we committed.

I'll let you know what it looks like after I've had a chance to review all the filings.

I spoke with Lee Hanse at Burlington Resources about the CIG Rate Case.  He invited us to join BR and Amoco in sharing the cost of the intervention, assuming that we agree on the issues.  The contact person at BR is Pete Cervin, I believe Stephanie and Rebecca know Pete.  Becky, Please advise me as to how we should proceed.

Paul-- I was in Phoenix the last week of August at an Arizona Corporation Commission (ACC) meeting on price risk managment for gas supply. Leslie Lawner from our gov affairs group had drafted comments for the meeting and attended as well.  During the discussion there was a question from one of the Commissioners to Sourthwest Gas asking why they were not looking into developing a gas storage site.  I believe that Leslie has been talking to Miguel in your group and that possibly there is a meeting set in the near future to discuss development of storage with Southwest Gas?

We have developed a good relationship with several of Governor Hull's staffers, one of whom was at the meeting.  He expressed to me later a strong interest in gas storage development and opined that more  gas storage could be very helpful to the region. It would be helpful for me if I could set up a call between you or whoever would be most knowledgeable on the development of gas storage in your group and the Governor's staffer (Craig Marks) so that he can get a sense of what the real financial/physical/regulatory issues are in such a development.  He has a close relationship with the ACC, and could very well be helpful in moving something forward if we had a strong interest in doing something to move gas storage development in Arizona.

Could you give me a call to discuss?  #612-339-4599.  Thanks.

Stephanie:  Confirming our phone conversation today, based on my reading of the Transco order and the PGT order, the FERC relied on a different standard in the Transco case (the 1995 Pricing Policy Statement) than they used in the PGT case (the 1999 Policy Statement on Certification of New Interstate Natural Gas Pipeline Facilities).  

The 1995 Policy Statement said that, when the roll-in increased rates to existing shippers by less than 5%, the pipeline needed to make only a general showing of system benefits, and FERC said that Transco had satisfied that showing.  

The 1999 Policy Statement, however, has a threshold requirement for expansion projects requiring that there can be no subsidization from existing customers - in other words, no increase in costs of any kind.  The PGT order found that there was a possibility that fuel costs could increase for existing shippers; therefore, PGT had to establish a surcharge mechanism to subject expansion shippers to an incremental fuel charge for fuel costs above those that would apply absent the new compression.  If the fuel costs do not increase, then there will be no surcharge.

Subject:	PGT Fuel Treatment

Greetings Becky:

Met with PGT the other day. Based upon a recent FERC ruling on the treatment of fuel on a project on Transco's Leidy Lateral (last 2 weeks), PGT is going to ask FERC to reverse its ruling on the 2002 expansion. If you remember, FERC was very clear on the notion that existing shippers should not subsidize increased costs associated with incremental shippers. I've been told that Transco received approval for rolled in treatment of higher fuel because they did not have an "incremental" tariff.  

This sounds very suspicious - can you please investigate?

Thanks,

Stephanie

Barry, thanks for the number.  Also, I just thought of something.  The 1:30

Send me a note when you get back and we can set up a meeting then.

Also, I received a notice from the IRS and it appears that they were
missing information on my wife and as such disallowed me claiming her as
a dependent.  I will send to your attention to review and clarify. Based
on my filing and actual refund there is about a $ 1k difference which I
believe is owed to me.

Good morning Barry,

Just to let you know that I am on holidays August 11-26, so your
counselling will have to be this week or when I return.

Did Enron provide you with approval for a "Post Arrival
Consultation"/PAC?
This is the counselling our PwC Houston office does.  (So, in effect
there
are two possible counselling sessions for assignees - the predeparture
counselling you are supposed to receive before you depart Canada and
then
there's the PAC).  PwC Houston is prepared to set up the "PAC" - they
simply want to know if you received approval for it.

Thanks,

Jeff, further to our conversation... this is the list of companies that have entered into contractual agreements with the DWR. I don't know if this means they have transaction but perhaps between Kim Ward and yourself, you can advise.

What I need to know is the legal status/issues ( if any ) of any of the companies listed here today as it relates to the state of California. 
Pan Canadian Energy Services, Occidental Energy Marketing, Dynegy Marketing and Trading , Texaco Natural Gas, BP Amoco, and Coast Energy Group. 

Can you advise If any of these companies form part of ongoing legal action against the state?

Once I know this, then we can decide on a plan what we should discuss with Mark Baldwin.

Thanks in advance.

I thought that is might be helpful to outline what we agreed to with EES.  I have taken a shot at it. I would like to get agreement within ENA and then forward to EES.  Please provide your comments.

BT;
- I feel like foghorn leghorn on this project (ie: "I'm pitching but not one's catching")...I have been trying to find ABC/ANG capacity (per your inquiry for 10,000 capacity for winter only) in addition to looking for 5,000 of ABC only capacity for Petrobank (they actually have firm ANG/PGT but let their ABC go) 
- fyi, (this has not been press released) but it looks like NOVA/ANG will have an additional 60,000 of contracted capacity avail this Nov 1 (part of the expansion that was to go with the PGT expansion but is being done early as it only goes as far as kinsgate)...no surprise that the shipper to get the capacity is BC Gas (to use for Southern Crossing) 
- I'm afraid that the best we can offer is IT Tolls (.17 C/GJ for Nova + .08 C/GJ for ANG + .06 for Fuel on ANG) = .31 C/GJ
- as far as ABC capacity, there are mismatches (that are complicated by higher fuel rates in the winter) but I will keep working the phones
- do you know if any of the PNW/Calif shippers-utilities have excess ABC capacity and an interest in ANG/PGT??? (Petrobank will likely look at any term winter/1 yr/longer)
- based on previous dealings, Petrobank is motivated 
   

Thanks,

Jeff, thanks again for attending the discussions with DWR.

Do you have any recon.... on exactly which plants DWR has the right to bring the fuel on. As Mark indicated, it was about 1/3 of their exposure, and most of that was in the south service area, but I am very interested in the actual facilities and whom used to bring fuel to them or run the units.'

There is a zero sum game on fuel... but the landscape changes depending on who buys it and how they buy it! 

Any thoughts.

With that being said, I am sure Dave is out marketing products and services to all of the Utilities in the PNW.

FYI.  Appears that the two sides may be crawling toward renegotiation.

Battle lines drawn over long-term power deals 
SD Union Tribune, 10.07.01 
In a perverse sign that normalcy is returning, the state's power crisis roared back to life last week with the California Public Utilities Commission as the focus. 

This time the state utilities commission pulled off a feat few could have anticipated, even from a long-running crisis that has caused blackouts and soaring electricity costs. 

In a span of three hours last week, the five-member panel went from being applauded by consumer groups and blasted by industry interests to being vilified by consumer advocates and applauded by business. 

Consumer advocates celebrated when the PUC refused to rubber stamp state-negotiated long-term power contracts, a move the governor said stalled the $12.5 billion bond offering needed to cover past power purchases. 

But business leaders and the governor cheered the PUC for approving a $3.3 billion rescue of Southern California Edison, which consumer advocates criticized as an unauthorized bailout. 

As massive as the Edison deal is, it may be less likely to affect customers of SDG&E than the second reality that emerged last week: Despite the PUC action on the contracts, Californians still face the burden of paying more than $40 billion over the next two decades for overpriced and possibly unneeded electricity. 

Or maybe not. 
While electricity providers continue to defend the long-term power contracts as fair and key to resolving the state's electricity crisis, consumer groups and others have launched a major offensive to get the contracts revised, renegotiated or canceled. 

Critics argue that the deals were negotiated while the state's economy was reeling, blackouts were striking and federal regulators were insisting that the state had to tie up the bulk of its electricity needs through long-term deals. 

Duress alleged 
Consumer advocates say the long-term contracts bind California to power purchases at more than double current market prices and force the state to buy power it does not need. 

"We should not be stuck with these agreements because conditions have changed so dramatically," said Bill Ahern, a senior analyst with Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine. "We did these agreements under duress, and it is better for the generators and us to negotiate what all believe is a good deal." 

Ahern also said an investigation of possible conflicts of interest for at least one member of the state team that negotiated the contracts could lead to their invalidation. 

Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego, notes that much of the power to be delivered under the agreements will come from new plants yet to be built in California. 

"The state has the ability through the siting process to modify those contracts," Shames said. The motivation to do so could grow soon, he added. 

"Especially in an election year, the question will be whether elected officials and the public will tolerate the (cost) of these contracts," Shames said. 

Shames noted that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pressed California to lock up much of its power under long-term contracts, because it argued that excessive reliance on short-term purchases was a major contributor to the power crisis. 

Now it appears the cost of that solution could exceed the cost of the short-term crisis, Shames said. 
Beyond the growing political pressure, San Diego attorney Michael Aguirre is arguing in appellate court that Gov. Gray Davis overstepped his legal authority by declaring an emergency and signing the long-term agreements in the first place. 

He says California's electricity deals violate state law regarding purchasing practices. 
"To circumvent that law by calling it an emergency does not pass legal muster," said Aguirre, who is suing electricity providers for overcharging. "There were other means to manage the emergency." 

The PUC also says the state locked itself into too much power for too long a period. 
"First and foremost, we should try to renegotiate, try to get shorter terms," said Gary Cohen, general counsel for the PUC.

Willingness to deal 
At least two major suppliers have indicated a willingness to discuss the matter, Cohen said. The PUC also will continue to press for changes to the agreements with FERC. 

The federal commission regulates wholesale power markets and is legally mandated to ensure prices are "just and reasonable." FERC is considering refunds for prices paid by California in spot power markets during the crisis. 

Cohen argues that if spot prices are subject to refunds, long-term contracts should be subject to similar relief. The PUC has made several filings pressing this point, but has received no response from FERC. 

For his part, the governor declines to call for renegotiation of the contracts. 
"In order to renegotiate we would have to have the generator come to us, and they have not done so," said Steve Maviglio, the governor's spokesman. "We would be pleased to sit down and renegotiate. But we have not been approached by anyone." 

Some experts believe Davis wants to break the contracts more than he is willing to say, but he must maintain credibility with the providers with whom he signed agreements. The same people speculate that the governor, who blasted the PUC last week for failing to help implement the agreements, may have privately welcomed the commission's action as a step toward revising the agreements. 

Power providers, meanwhile, continue to support the agreements. 
"The contracts are good for the state and helped stabilize the market," said William Highlander, director of public relations for Calpine Corp. 

The San Jose company is the largest provider under the controversial agreements, with some $13 billion in contracts. Calpine hopes to provide much of that power from new plants it is building within California. 

Sempra says contract fair 
The company has not been approached by the state to revise its agreements, said Highlander, and he declined to say how Calpine would respond to such an overture. 

San Diego-based Sempra Energy, another major provider under the agreements, also insists its contracts provide power at fair rates to the state. 

Michael Niggli, president of Sempra Energy Resources, said his company will provide power for about 4 to 5 cents per kilowatt hour, based upon current natural gas prices. 

"It's pretty tough to say, 'Let's renegotiate the lowest price contract,' " Niggli said. 
But V. John White, director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies, said Sempra's contract and others lock the state into power that consumers are unlikely to need, and too much of the electricity comes from non-renewable sources. 

White says state consumers are being held hostage by some unnecessary posturing. 
"There are indications from several generators that a call to renegotiate would be responded to," White said. "The generators say nobody asked us. The governor says nobody has volunteered. 

"But the opportunity is there at this moment to renegotiate. Why don't we ask?" 
***************************************************************** 
State authority buying more power for 2002 
Critics say it's too costly, perhaps unnecessary and may be sold off later at a loss 
OC Register, 10.07.01 
SACRAMENTO -- California's new power agency is rushing to buy more electricity for next summer, even as the state has come under fire for buying too much costly power and then having to sell it at bargain prices. 

Moreover, another state agency says the state will have enough power - because of existing contracts and conservation - to get through the hottest of summers next year. 

The new power purchases, which are being negotiated by the California Public Power and Financing Authority, could add as much as 3,000 megawatts of power to California - enough for about 2.3 million homes - by June. That would be in addition to the existing $43 billion in long-term agreements the state has already inked with power generators. 

Many observers - even those supportive of the power authority's goal to increase cleaner, alternative energy sources in the state - are balking at the agency's rapid pace, saying consumers will end up paying more in the long run. 

"We're dumping power and (authority Chairman) David Freeman is buying more power. What's up with that? It's absolutely ludicrous,'' said Harry Snyder, executive director of Consumers' Union, which publishes Consumer Reports. 

A draft report by the California Energy Commission shows the state already has plenty of power for next year. 
Without the extra power being negotiated by the power authority, even in a very hot summer, the state would have about 6,000 extra megawatts during peak periods, when it needs 63,800 megawatts, about a 9 percent cushion. That is if all power plants came online as expected and residents continued to conserve as they are. 

In a normal summer, such as this year's, the state would have 10,000 extra megawatts above the average 59,000 megawatts it needs, roughly a 17 percent surplus. 

Power authority officials counter that those surplus figures are estimates that depend on people conserving at the rate they did this summer. "The more we own of our own supply, the more we can control the market,'' said state Treasurer Phil Angelides, an authority board member. 

Said Freeman: "We are thinking our way through what we should do for next summer. That why we get paid the big bucks." 
New contracts would increase 'green' power 
In addition, at least one-third of the new energy the power authority is trying to buy - 1,000 megawatts - would come from solar, wind and other renewable energy providers, officials said. 

Such generators were left out when the state signed its initial round of contracts. Bringing on 1,000 more megawatts would increase the portion of the state's energy derived from renewable resources to 13 percent. The long-term goal is 17 percent. 

The remaining power purchased under the new contracts, perhaps 2,000 megawatts, would be from so-called "peaker'' plants - less efficient jet-engine-like generators that are turned on only during emergency shortages. 

The emphasis on these natural gas plants irks many environmentalists, but proponents of them say these would be a new generation of gas peakers. While not preferable to conventional generating plants, they would pollute less than the peakers currently being pressed into service. If California can build new, more efficient ones, it can retire the old polluting ones, the argument goes. 

Nonetheless, critics fear the state, rushing into new negotiations, will leave ratepayers with more expensive power contracts. They note that the authority hasn't completed an assessment on exactly how much power it really needs and what it wants for the state's power portfolio. That assessment won't be done until February. 

"I hope they have a basis on which they've determined they need those (3,000) megawatts of contracts,'' said Lenny Goldberg, a lobbyist for The Utility Reform Network, a consumer watchdog group. 

Businesses worry new pacts will hurt them 
Even the state's businesses are critical. 
They believe that the more expensive long-term power there is under state contract, the less likely lawmakers are to businesses go into the open market to buy the cheaper electricity they think they can get there. 

Lawmakers, they believe, will want to force businesses to continue to buy power under the contracts they've negotiated because if the businesses were allowed to pull out, residential customers alone would be left paying the higher prices that those contracts dictate. 

Lawmakers are reluctant to put any more burdens on the average consumer, who they feel are the unintended victims of a severely flawed deregulation system. 

"I would just as soon not see them negotiate any more contracts,'' said Jack Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association. 

The state power authority was signed into law in May to build its own plants, help others finance them and compete with the private power companies. Leading the $5 million-a-year agency is Freeman, the former head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and one of Davis' closest advisers during the energy crisis. 

The Legislature's auditors are casting a critical eye at the power authority and will hold hearings next month. 
"It's not an investigation,'' said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Felton, chairman of the Joint Legislative Audit Committee. But "it's appropriate early and often to review their work in a public venue and have them held accountable for compliance of the law.'' 

Keeley's committee is looking into the planned purchases and he said he could not yet conclude whether the power authority's actions could help or hurt the state. 

Freeman said onlookers have been too quick to criticize the state's work. 
"The plain truth is we had blackouts last winter. We did what we could. We kept the rates stable and lights on,'' Freeman said. "Criticism is real easy with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight.''

I am never big on utility guys.  This guy seems to be very focused on Sumas compared to U.S. supplies.  I think he is a want to be trader who got out of hand at a utility.

Mark, I have reviewed resume and although Kevin may have very good trading credentials for this area I am of the opinion that he is a trader and am unclear as to his actual customer contact knowledge... I am sure he knows who they are, not sure if they know who he is other than short dated structures.

Chad,  hope trading is going well.  Weather has been cool so I expect Sumas
basis has been tightening appropriately.   Per our conversation last week,
attached is my resume for your consideration.  Please pass on to the
appropriate people.   I am motivated in finding a position with a
progressive marketing company who could use my experience and knowledge of
the NW gas and electric market and where I can be part of a team that has
much larger view on the markets..   I definitely know that Enron fits that
model...

Thanks, Kevin

Attached for your review and comments is Enron's Answer to Motion for Partial Summary Disposition by the Texas, New Mexico and Arizona full-requirements shippers in the complaint proceeding that they filed in July (RP01-486).  The shippers have asked the Commission to (a) summarily determine that El Paso's mainline capacity is not adequate to serve its existing firm customers and (b) expeditiously establish a remedy phase in this proceeding.

Enron's answer reiterates the comments it filed in the original proceeding, namely that the Commission should consolidate this proceeding with the complaint filed in RP01-484 by the Joint Complainants (producers, California LDCs) which also deals with issues of adequacy of capacity.  We also reiterate and emphasize our original proposal that the Commission require El Paso to immediately give existing firm shippers the opportunity to turn back capacity they no longer need as one means of making additional capacity available to those who need more.

You do not need to respond, but if you desire to, please get any comments back to me or Leslie by noon tomorrow.  Thanks.

Is this what you think John wants to see, or should we go into more detail?  I tried to get the storage guys a meeting with these guys earlier in the summer but I was not successful.  I do not know if they were ever successful in getting that meeting.  I do not think so.

PG&E will announce via press release very early next week an open season on Redwood, Baja and Silverado.
It comes in direct response to recent announcements of expansions into California by pipelines.
The bid protocols will be structured similar to original open season from the original Gas Accord.
The open season will start on June 1 and end on July 31.
Capacity will be available starting 1.1.03.
Bidders will be able to bid up to 30 years (PG&E states that that's what generators want).
Accompanying the announcement will be another announcement that PG&E will expand Redwood by 200mmcf/day, which they hope to have available by 1.1.03, or some time during Q103.
About 2-4 weeks after the open season begins, PG&E will file its proposed "Gas Accord II,"  (the first one expires end of 02).
As part of that filing, PG&E will offer its proposed ratemaking treatment for the next five years (beginning 1.1.03).
PG&E will not include in the open season 1) core capacity and 2) certain EAD contracts that extend beyond the Gas Accord 1 end date.
In addition, PG&E will hold back an additional 20% (after excluding core and EAD), to be "open-seasoned" at some "future" date.
The capacity to be auctioned is: 1) 900 mmcf/day on Redwood, 2) 245 (annual) on Baja, plus an additional 200/day in summer on Baja, 3) 155 on Silverado.
How PG&E will market the 20% they intend to hold back, and when they might auction it off in the future will be discussed in PG&E's Gas Accord II filing.
No single company will be awarded more than 30% of the capacity on any specific path in the primary open season (though firms can bid whatever level of capacity they choose).

Please forwad along to anyone else who might be interested.  If you have any questions, just holler.

Best,
Jeff

I was in Mexico City... for school

What has happened to your stock price.... you will have to work for many
more years.  

What is the hedging loss about that I saw reported? 

When are you coming to cowtown and have time for a quick visit? 

Bryn and I are in Denver Nov 2-5.  Any chance you happen to be there then? A

How much longer for school for you? ... I know you will do fine!!

All in all things are going pretty good, work is OK, pretty busy myself.


What have you guys been up to? Traveling sure sucks now...  How is Bryn?


Are there anymore Canadian E&P Co.'s left... it seems like they have all
been bought up by U.S. Kids?.. how is the House? 

I noticed Anandarko... wrote down $ 464 MM because of their Canadian
assets... could that be the Berkley indigestion? 

I better run.. come and visit me soon.. but let's talk sooner.

Well, we are having to sell it because we are so short of cash right now.
Really for a lot of reasons. We have had to make an investment of our own to
do a demo so we could shop it to labels in the U.S. This is working out well
as we have had a few discussions already. Also there have been some serious
changes in the way U.S. Immigration is working and it has really screwed a
lot of touring bands. It has made us cancel already 10 shows for September.
They basically changed the rules overnight on everybody. There is nothing we
can do about it unless we know a member of Congress or we have a $1000 U.S..
We may have to come up with the $1000. We think that we may be able to book
tours that will allow us to just rent a vehicle when we need one. That is
what we are looking at right now. I am at home by the way, and here until at
least the 15th of September.

I was going to send you one in a day or so after I figured out what was
going on. We have put some money already in the bank this month. Ken put
in
$400 and we are trying to get the rest in before the end of the month.
We
are also trying to sell the van. It's tough right now and we need to
make a
few changes. We of course would sell it and pay off the loan with you. I
believe it is around or just under $4000. We will have to work out a
specific balance with you. I hope to sell it soon, but we will have to
wait
and see. Mom does sound well although I wonder if you think she is
getting
the best advice from her lawyer?????? I just think she should get this

with. Sounds like maybe she is reticent to go any further. Let me know

Barry -

My name is Brian Wood and I am an Associate who is currently up for rotation. I spoke with Shelly Friesenhahn from the Associate/Analyst Program and she recommended that I contact you about openings within your group.  I would be very interested in talking to you in order to find out if I would be a good fit for your needs.

I have spoken with an Associate in your group, Phil Polsky, and am excited about the business and learning opportunities in West Coast Gas Origination.  In my previous rotations, I have participated in a broad base of structuring, modeling, and origination activities.  To provide further detail about my experiences and achievements, I have attached my resume for your review.  

With everything going on in the company, I know it may be difficult to find time to meet with me.   Please let me know when it would be most convenient to stop by.  I look forward to having the chance to explain how I could provide value to your group.

Thank you for your consideration,

Brian Wood
Associate

Subject:	Citizens - Deal structure summary

As a follow up to yesterday's meeting, below is a summary of the course of action to be taken in response to Citizens comments on the service agreement with EAMR.

Enron will work with Citizens to put an insurance policy in place, which meets the insurance provisions requested by Citizens and which names both Citizens and EAMR as policy holders.  See attached file for proposed policy details.
The cost for this policy (not to be revealed to Citizens) will be between $5,000 and $7,500 and will be paid for by ENA.
ENA will enter into a side letter agreement with EAMR, which will provide for the insurance premium payment.
Upon agreement with Citizens on the insurance policy details, EAMR is agreeable to executing a services agreement with Citizens, however, Citizens must agree to EAMR's indemnity and liability contract language as written in its original draft (see attached below). 


Attached is a file containing Citizens' comments on its draft services agreement with EAMR.  Article 8 of the draft agreement details the insurance provisions requested by Citizens.
 
For reference, the original draft sent to Citizens dated effective January 15, 2001 is attached below:

Sorry,  click on Modern Art and then click on 'see catologue' then type
1032.  I thought the link would take you straight to the print.  I feel
shame.  Nobody said collecting art was easy.

I gave you the wrong lot number... type in 1032 instead to get the Great
One.
I think 1031 is Haakan Loob.

Spoke to Ray Welch.
They were supposed to meet with their lawyer yesterday - the lawyer never showed up.
They'll try to get their comments together in the next few days.
He mentioned that they were meeting internally on your transport swap structure Barry.
