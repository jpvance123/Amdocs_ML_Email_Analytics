Harry,
Thanks for taking some to talk today.  Below is some marketing material that we have put together on real estate derivatives.  Hopefully you'll be hearing more about this in the future.  I also attached my resume.  I am currently looking for a rotation and I know you guys are pretty set, but keep me in mind if things change.
Thanks,

Attached is a current summary of the plans for each region as they stand right now.  Mr Presto had me add an extra manager to each group, so that should be the only change--unless one was submitted by you.  Please call if you have any questions.


Thanks

Subject:	Enron Management Conference - Home Video Project


The Enron Management Conference will be held Wednesday through Friday, November 14-16, 2001, at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio.  While the business agenda is still being finalized, there is one thing that is certain ... we want to inject some humor into the event.  The past year has been eventful, and at times challenging, for Enron and its employees.  However, it's not in Enron's corporate fabric to focus on the past.  Instead, we want to look ahead, and even laugh at ourselves.  The Management Conference will provide a platform for just that.

We want to challenge each of the business units to develop and submit a humorous "Home Video" to be presented at the Management Conference.  The video can address any Enron-related topic that your business unit chooses.  However, there are a few rules to follow.
1.) The videos should be no more than five minutes long.
2.) Business units should spend as little as possible on the videos, and no more than $10,000.  Innovision Communications (Beth Stier) has agreed to work with any business unit to help them create an original, inexpensive video.  Innovision can be contacted at 713-446-4424.
3.) The videos should be fun, but not disparaging.  They should adhere to Enron's values of respect, integrity, communication and excellence.
4.)  By Monday, October 15, business units need to notify me of their intention to submit a video.  To avoid duplication, business units will also need to identify a topic they intend to address.
5.) To ensure inclusion in the Management Conference agenda, videos need to be submitted to me by Friday, November 9.
6.)  Awards will be given for creativity and humor.  The first annual, and soon-to-be-coveted, "Enny" will also be awarded for "Best Overall Video."

If you have any questions about the "Home Video" project, please contact myself or Mary Clark.

Harry and Steve,

Couple of updates on the TVA tolls:

Please change the gas assumption to NYMEX + $.50/mmBtu (this adder is a fixed cost so it should not be affected by volatility)
Also, price the 200 MWs for a 3 year term starting 6/1/03 and the 500MWs for a 3 year term starting 1/1/02.  Sorry for the confusion.

What kind of time frame do you see for providing an indicative offer for these two products?

Thanks.

- Nick

Harry:

Long time no hear. I can imagine you must be pretty busy these days. So how 
is the summer shaping up. Are u guys going on a vacation this last week 
before the Fall term starts? Enron has been in the news quite a lot 
recently. Jeff Skilling's leaving the company was quite a shocker.

As for me, I finally received my H1-B visa. As you know I am currently 
living temporarily with my sister in NJ and am moving to Boston Sept 1. I 
had a few questions to ask you and also take u up on your offer of helping 
me with the GC processing.

1) Do I have to goto Vancouver to get my H1-B visa from the US consulate in 
Vancouver. I had given my Vancouver address on my visa application and the 
notice from INS says the the Vancouver consulate is the one that will 
process my visa. I was wondering since I am in NJ, I could drive down to TO 
or Ottawa easily.

2) Can you give me the contact details of the lawyer you used for the GC 
under the E-11 category and also how much would she charge for the GC 
application. Also what do i have to gather in terms of documents and also do 
I have to get a letter from the employer?

Say my hello to your parents and Nicole. Hope to hear from you soon.

Harnek 'Nik' Minhas

Steve,

	As per your request, here is a copy of the heat rate model that Nick Hiemstra (from structuring) and I have been debugging for the Motown deal.

	Feel free to test it out on your trade and please let us know the comparative results.

Thanks,

Did you ever get a chance to look at this resume.  Real smart guy(is actually a Phd), worked a few years in strategy consulting. Great business sense.  Would be great fit in any strategy work we do.

As we discussed....... as much flesh as we can put on this by midday tommorrow would be quite helpful. I would think there are significant aggregation opportunities available to us once this is implemented. Let me know what else you need from me. Thanks.

The attached resume is from an options trader at Coral that comes highly recommended.   I think he would be a great addition to the options desk.   Please work with Charles Taylor in HR to expedite the interview/recruiting process.

I recommend you start defining the options reporting requirements (use gas reports as starting point) and maybe spend some time with Greg Woulfe (former East Power options trader who now works in EBS) to pick his brain on what is necessary to expand the market and manage an options desk effectively.

Thanks.

Hi again,

	Just to clarify. The headquarters for Progress is in San Francisco.

	However, their fund managers are all over the U S and a few outside the U S.

Ciao,
Iris

Hi Harry,

	Hope you had a good trip to New York and got lots of business from the hedge fund managers you met with.

	Just an idea:  I was chatting with Jaime about some friends of mine who are the founders and executives of Progress Investment Management (a "Fund of Funds" in San Francisco).  The last time I chatted with them they had between 3-4 billion USD under management via various fund managers.

	Some of their funds are invested in hedge funds and in venture capital funds.

	Do you think it would be worthwhile to make their acquaintance regarding our products?

Thanx,
Iris

Mr. Ramiro G Vazquez Assistant Director Sales & Technical Services of "Merichem Chemical & Refinery Services" was here in India and was remembering you. He was again asking to tell you  his interest for working with Enron. Then in his other official mail, he asked " did you speak to your nephew". Looks he is impressed with your talk for a few minutes.

A backup seat and a backup computer have been assigned to you.  Please read this communication in detail.


Purpose:  Net Works has developed a backup plan for possible work stoppages after moving to the new building.  A wider business continuity plan will be rolled out next year.

Location:  Large areas of the 30th and 31st floors of the current building, Enron Center North, will be set aside for recovery purposes.  Your name has been put on the list and you will be notified once the seat assignments are finalized.  Locations will also be posted at the entryways on the 30th and 31st floors.

Timing.  Through November, backup seats assignments will be announced as each trading group moves to the new building.  The backup seats will be available at least to January 1st.

Testing.  Test times to try the backup PC and to familiarize yourself with your backup location will be announced by the IT team as the locations are finished.

Telephones.   Only regular phones will be available.  For those with speed dial phones, the IT team will download the numbers and leave them on a piece of paper at your seat assignment.  Because the numbers change frequently, we ask that you rely on keeping track of the numbers yourself and use the number lists as a last resort.
 
Other supplies.  The IT team is not responsible for non-technical or special needs.  If you rely on hard copy forms, address books, etc, you will need to be sure to leave appropriate supplies when you test the computer, or bring supplies along if you are asked to move to your backup seat.

Limited Access.  The backup floor is not meant as a backup day-to-day work environment.  To keep the equipment functioning and secure, we plan to limit access except for test times and if we need to invoke the plan because of a work stoppage.  

Escalation Procedures.  The plan will be  as follows:  

I.	During regular business hours

A.  Announcement.  You will be notified via the PA system if you need to move to the backup location.  

-OR-

B.  No Announcement.  If an obvious problem like a fire or power shutdown occurs, for example, all personnel with a seat assignment will be expected to make their way to their backup seat without notification.


II.	After hours

For after hours issues, greeters will announce the move to the backup location as people arrive to work.  E-mails and voice mails will also be distributed.

Hi Stephanie,

Can I get test ID's for Rob Stalford and Harry Arora. They should have access to all the US  Power Products in test.

HI Melba,

Can you set up Financial Power Product types in test and getting it mapped to the financial swap product type. If this could be done sometime before Monday it will be great. Thanks.

Savita

Harry and Rob,

Could you read though the attached email.  Dana and I will need your imput tomorrow.  Garrett


Dana,,

Lavo would like us to show some hedging products to the Ontario government that would allow the government to feel comfortable opening the market this Winter (if all Retail and Wholesale IT systems are in place).  The government is worried about a Pickering unit not returning on Schedule (Dec. 31st 2001).  Our product will address this 'resource adequacy' issue.  

The government can not lift this offer. However, the government, if they want the province to be hedged, could ask OPG or OEFC to look into the products we are suggesting. 

Here is some product idea's and Indicative pricing.  Please review, and let's discuss which we should show.  With such a large volume, we would have to consider a price premium for Congestion and Ancillary Service risks associated with exporting from NY.  
For comparison, I priced the same products using NY West.

Jaime,

Attached is the long descriptions for the put and call daily power options.  Also on this document is the unit of measure and exercise information.  The only thing we lack is the location description and the reference period, both of which will be inserted into the long description when the product is created.  Let me know what you think.

Hey Harry,

Here are the hydro plant capacities for most of the regions.  You can filter by region or sub-region to receive the plant capacities for that area.  

 
Hope this helps out.

Hi Harry,

Thanks a lot for your help.
IOU big time buddy !!

Can you send me whenever you have time,
the titles, etc. of these people on
the email list,
or let me know where I can get it myself.

As suggested by Suresh, I emailed him 
my current resume. He was planning on me
coming in and meeting 6-7 EES people.

I am also attaching my updated resume for your
records.

Talk to you soon. We are anyway visiting
Houston this weekend for Kavita's baby shower.
and will see you then.

cheers,

Gurmeet

I actually spent a lot of time last night reshaping the resume. Couldn't
forward this to you this morning, somehow the remote connection
was not working.

Here is the new look. Let me know if this works.

I am in Reston, VA today and will be here till Thursday afternoon.
Let me know if you have any questions/suggestions.

Thanks a lot

Cheers,
Gurmeet

Gurmeet

I spoke to John Lavo who runs the Americas group. He wanted to have a
look at your resume.  I was wondering if you could slant your resume to
energy somewhat further and make it punchier because this resume does
come out as a generalist resume. Also some price risk management
consulting (not the cost side but top line ) would be helpful.

Give me a call when you get a chance.


Harry

Hi Harry:

Didn't see you at the gurudwara yesterday. The planned Kirtan event
never
took place
so Uncle and Aunty didn't miss anything.

Just wanted to follow up and send you my resume, in case you need this
for
the meeting.

Let me know the next steps.

Thanks for your help


Cheers,
Gurmeet

Hi Harry, 

      I hope you had good weekend.  The weather in College Station (for the Aggie football game) & Austin was beautiful & sunny.  We never saw the rain. 

      I am sending you my resume for any contacts you may have within Enron or anyone else in the Industry.  I am very interested in this industry in which I can utilize my communication, interpersonal skills and business experience.  I posses strong leadership, motivation skills and long-term client relations that would be of great value to any organization.  I am adept to working in a fast-pace environment and Team oriented group to reach company and personal objectives.  I am keenly interested in making a strong contribution and commitment to a company in the energy industry and my decision to pursue my goals within energy.  I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss my credentials with you or any contacts you may have in a personal interview.  Please feel free to contact me at your earliest convenience. 

      I hope to see you & Nicole this Thursday night around 6:30.  Thank you again for your help.

Dave

One of my close friends is looking for a job. He has been in strategy consulting for the last four years, first for Mckinsey and then for Accenture. He is a very smart guy and has great business sense. I have known him for a long time, great guy and can get things done. 
He is a business strategy and restructuing guru. Gurmeet had a baby and he is very keen in moving out of consulting. I am enclosing his resume here and I am going to take the liberty of asking him to give you a call. Will appreciate your taking a look.


 

Harry

Subject: RTO Week -- Summary of Day One Panel


Today was the first day of FERC's "RTO Week" in Washington, D.C.  The topic of today's panel was "RTO Markets and Design:  Required Markets and Optional Markets."  The issues in both panels were quickly merged and the two panels discussed all of the issues.  

Panel One:  Mandatory RTO Markets<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" />

The morning panel consisted of the following participants:  Peter Cramton (University of Maryland), David Hadley (Indiana PSC), Mark Kleinginna (Ormet), John Meyer (Reliant), John O'Neal (Mirant), and Roy Shanker (consultant for generators in the Northeast).  

Energy Spot Market

There was unanimous agreement among these panelists that the RTO must run a real time energy, or spot, market.  Most panelists agreed that the spot market should be a bid-based, security-constrained system with economic dispatch.  In response to a question from Pat Wood, most also agreed that nodal (LMP) pricing should be used in the spot market, although John Meyer from Reliant stated that zonal pricing is used in ERCOT and that works also.  

Day Ahead Market and Balanced Versus Unbalanced Schedules

Most of the panelists said that the RTO should not require balanced schedules.  Peter Cramton said that with a day-ahead market, no need for balanced schedules because the real time market prices will discipline behavior.  John Meyer agrees, saying if there is no balanced schedules requirement, then there might be a need for a day-ahead market.  John notes that ERCOT has a balanced schedule requirement.  John also said that imbalance penalties could be appropriate for imbalances that hurt the system.   Roy Shanker also said FERC needs either a balanced schedules requirement (which he does not recommend) or have a day-ahead market.

ICAP Requirement

Most of the panelists (except Peter Cramton -- University of MD) support an ICAP requirement.  However, none of the panelists could point to an effective ICAP market (Roy Shanker says he has an idea of what would work - we will probably see this in comments in the ICAP proceeding due later this week).  

Mark from Ormet kept bringing the message back to the need to know the rules and know that the rules will not change substantially over time.  Mark said liquidity in PJM does not help him move power to the Midwest since the rules are undefined outside of PJM.  He cannot enter into long-term contracts because he does not know what the rules will be one or more years out.  He also said you can have an ICAP market but market participants have to be able to meet ICAP requirements through load response.

 Standardized Markets

 Most of the panelists agreed that the mandatory markets should be real time and day-ahead energy markets, spinning and non-spinning reserves and regulation should also be required and be standardized.

Massey asked if the costs to standardize are outweighed by the benefits.  Roy Shanker said the Northeast works so FERC should not change it.  Even if FERC does not require standardization between the RTOs, creating large RTOs and fixing the problems within the RTOs will be a big improvement.  Mark with Ormet and the Indiana Commissioner both urged FERC to standardize the mandatory markets among the RTOs.

Panel Two:  Optional RTO Markets

The afternoon panel consisted of the following participants:  Fiona Woolfe (lawyer with experience in England and Wales pool); Roy Thilly (Wisconsin Public Power Inc.); Richard Pierce (professor at George Washington); Glen Arthur (Connecticut PSC); Steve Naumann (Commonwealth Edison); Ed Cazalet (APX).

This panel was intended to cover optional market issues, including whether a day-ahead market is needed and whether there should be ICAP markets.  This panel addressed these issues as well as the need for a real time market, market monitoring, and other issues.

Mandatory Markets

Other than Ed Cazalet (APX), the other panelists for the most part agree that the RTO should run a real time and day-ahead energy market, ancillary services markets, and there must be an ICAP requirement.  Ed Cazalet believes that there only needs to be a small balancing market (perhaps with balanced schedules requirements) and leave the creation of any other markets to independent entities to create.

 ICAP

 Most of the panelists believe that the RTO should provide a day-ahead market, congestion management and ancillary services.  Most also favor an ICAP requirement and market.

Pat Wood said he is not convinced that a blanket ICAP requirement is needed on Day One.  He has been considering an ICAP requirement that does not apply until triggers are reached, and perhaps that should be considered here as well.  He has also been talking with a Northeast regulator about having different requirements for states depending on whether they have retail access or not.

Shelton Cannon (Staff) asked the panelists to assume one Midwest RTO - can there be different ICAP requirements within the RTO?  Most panelists agree that if the ICAP rules are the same within the RTO, that there could be percentage requirement deviations.

Day Two of RTO Week focuses on Congestion Management in the morning and Transmission Planning and Expansion in the afternoon.  We will get summaries out on these panels tomorrow.

Please call me with questions or comments.

Harry,

I hope all is going well in Houston.  Thanks again for introducing me around
Enron when I cam to visit a couple months ago.  Hopefully you heard that I
accepted the internship and will be starting on June 4th.  I am very excited
about getting involved with Enron, learning as much as possible, and
hopefully contributing value to some interesting projects.

I am writing you for some advice.  I do not know which group I will be
working in this summer.  I am very excited about the company and would like
to perform well once I start.  Is there something I could do to prepare
myself?  I would like to begin reading and learning about the industry.
Unfortunately, Enron is involved in several industries, making it difficult
to know which to research.  Do you have any suggestions?

I look forward to seeing you this summer.

Sincerely,

Vic

Subject: RE: RTO Week -- Summary of Standards and Practices Panel


RTO Week

 <?xml:namespace prefix =3D o ns =3D "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:offi=
ce" />

Day 4 - October 18, 2001

Afternoon Session

=20

Standardizing Markets, Business, and Other Practices=20

Panelists for this discussion were:  Sarah Barpoulis, PG&E National Energy =
Group; William P. Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Chr=
istiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC Gene=
ral Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnes=
ota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Co=
mpany.

=20


General Observations


=20

The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left la=
te in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, t=
he commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of=
 all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed; =
much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seeme=
d very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry fo=
rward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover for=
ward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize tha=
t some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed t=
o be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was d=
iscussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the=
 reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was noticea=
ble conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two org=
anizations somewhat common during the discussions.=20

=20


FERC Deliverables


A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne=
eded from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they =
felt was critical. =20

The first major topic was "How many RTOs?  What is their scope?"  All panel=
ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b=
y FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific langua=
ge, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.

The next topic was, "What will be standard market design?"  Panelists varie=
d on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged f=
or one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid sta=
ndard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (=
followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the curre=
nt situation.

The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha=
t the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic=
 throughout their discussions, asking questions like, "Do we need to issue =
a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?" and, "How much detail do you=
 need us to provide?"   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they =
wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as t=
o say FERC should "Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a=
 little further."  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, bu=
t in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and t=
he need for cautious investigation. =20

One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc=
heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th=
e "RTO Design and RTO Implementation" section would address many of the que=
stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Korm=
os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying =
a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The se=
ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following =
questions:


?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occu=
r, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i=
s nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there=
 be others that must be accommodated?


?         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to sch=
edule ("covered" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protect=
ing from congestion charges (both "covered" and "uncovered" schedules are a=
llowed)?=20


?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission =
services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues=
 to be addressed?


?         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing pr=
ior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to reti=
re those contracts?  Are there other solutions?


?         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function?=
 Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules)=
, be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced sche=
dules), or will they be required at all?


?         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed =
in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary=
 services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as fina=
ncial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?


?         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses? =
 Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce=
ss, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technical=
ly unwieldy?


?         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrate=
d into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that =
non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to t=
reat each NJE as a separate entity?


Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica=
l questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which =
to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions=
, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., "do congestion management") will t=
ake a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., "LMP with financi=
al hedging instruments") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike =
about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible =
to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.

Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) refer=
red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati=
on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out=
 said, "My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't =
believe that that statement is true."  He then backpedaled a bit and said t=
hat it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assert=
ion by the Northwest interests was false.


NERC and GISB


A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-se=
tting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, "Are we looking at a bea=
uty contest between NERC and GISB?"  Cook and Boswell then went into severa=
l short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants cont=
inually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interesting=
ly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI=
SB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the "new" structure of NERC and=
 did not focus on its history.

Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a=
sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were=
 they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily a=
ble to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin=
g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Poin=
t, Brownell.

Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-m=
an.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's suppos=
ed "successes," such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will =
likely remember that these "successes" have not been so successful, resulti=
ng in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments=
 in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show=
 the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.

There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues=
, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some =
talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.

The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly ur=
ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade=
rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC s=
omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would=
 say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.

Let me know if you have any questions.

I have recently spoke with most of you about increasing our emphasis on structured product deal flow. Over the past 12 months, East Power mid-marketers have been focused on covering every customer across the eastern interconnect. Our deal flow through June 30, 2001 stands at 201 term transactions vs. 25 at the same time last year. That's an increase of 8 times. This represents outstanding performance.  Many of those transactions have been relatively standard energy block and option structures. The proliferation of EOL   among our customers has had the effect of shrinking standard product margins. Therefore, we need to increase emphasis on customized risk management products in order to optimize value extraction from our customer base.

We must identify 5 potential "break-out" customers within each of NEPOOL, NYISO, PJM, FRCC, SERC, SPP, MAPP, MAIN and ECAR. That's 45 total target customers for those counting. A break-out customer is a customer with which Enron executes substantial increased transaction flow (especially structured products) with significant associated origination value. I need both coverage and structured product mid-marketers to work as a team to do detailed profiles of the business of each of these customers. A non-exhaustive list of issues to analyze are:

					- What is the customers fundamental business(es) 
					- Supply/demand fundamentals
					- Tariff implications
					- State regulatory implications 
					- Identify their risks 
					- RTO affiliation
					- Open access issues

Profiles should be complete by Friday August 10. I will review completed profiles with each of you.  We will develop custom risk management presentations for each of these customers for role out after the profiles are complete. I will be working with Harry Arora to develop presentation materials. Let me know if you have any questions.


Thanks,   Ed

At Enron, we're good at a lot of things:  making markets, commoditizing products, managing risk, offering innovative energy solutions to customers - the list goes on and on.  However, one of the things we could do a lot better is watching our expenses.  We're all shareholders in this company, and we need to spend our company's dollars as wisely as we spend our own.

There are some simple, yet significant measures each of us can take to make sure we're careful with Enron's money.  The Policy Committee has approved and recommended the following:

?	Professional Services - This is our largest area of discretionary spending, at more than $600 million last year. "Professional Services" includes our contracts with outside law and accounting firms, contractors and other consulting groups.  To make sure that we are negotiating the best rates and terms of service for the company across business units, we are requiring all future professional service contracts and those up for renewal to be negotiated through or in consultation with Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS), effective July 1.  In addition, contracts for more than $5,000 must be pre-approved by the business unit senior executive or their designee and GSS.  For more information, see http://ibuyit.enron.com.

?	On-line expense reporting tool XMS - XMS, our online expense reporting tool, enables us to expedite, monitor and report expenses.  Effective July 1, all employees on domestic U.S. payroll will be required to use XMS for reimbursement of business-related expenses. To access XMS, go to http://xms.enron.com/.  

?	Enterprise wide portal - We currently have 122 internal web sites across the company.  The amount of technology work, marketing collateral, and other related costs required to develop and support so many portals is sizeable.  It makes sense to have one Enron portal so you can efficiently access content and services through a single, personalized channel that will make it easier for you to find information and perform basic tasks online.  This new company-wide portal, under the leadership of Tony Mends, will be launched in several phases beginning this fall.  

Another significant area where we can be more diligent in our spending is travel and entertainment.  Enron has long had travel policies in place.  As we have grown, we have not done as well as we should have in communicating those policies to new employees and reminding all employees to take advantage of the discounts we have negotiated.  The availability of discounts and booking services online should make it easy to save money for the company without sacrificing the comfort of employees who travel.  The following are common sense recommendations that we should all adhere to when traveling for business.  Any regular deviations from these travel policy recommendations will be reviewed by each business unit leader.

?	Air travel - Employees are requested to use either Travel Agency in the Park (TAP) or the GSS-approved preferred travel agency for your location - all of which have access to the significant airfare discounts negotiated by GSS - or http://clicktrip.enron.com/enron, the new online travel booking service that allows employees to book their own travel with the same negotiated discounts.  Employees who fly in the United States should book non-refundable coach tickets, which are typically 65 percent less than refundable tickets and can usually be changed by simply paying a $100 fee.  For this reason, we strongly encourage all employees to purchase non-refundable domestic coach tickets when possible.

?	Lodging - GSS has also negotiated preferred rates at a number of hotel chains in many cities worldwide to accommodate each business unit's individual hotel policy.  We recommend that you use Enron's list of preferred hotels to select accommodations that are in line with your business unit's policies.  You can view the list at http://travel.enron.com.

?	Car rental services - When renting a car for business travel, employees should use our preferred car rental agencies - National (U.S. and Canada) and Alamo (U.S.)- since the agreements we have negotiated are intended to protect you and Enron through the insurance coverage in our contract.  Visit http://travel.enron.com for details and updates to services available outside the U.S.

?	Off-site meetings - All domestic-U.S. off-site meetings and events with more than 10 people should be coordinated through GSS, which will negotiate preferred rates for Enron.  They can be reached at (713) 646-8311.

Because there are differences between business units and offices, each business unit leader will follow up this memo with a communication further elaborating on these policies as they apply to their business unit.

Each of us has a responsibility to make sure we do our part to ensure Enron retains its competitive edge.  These recommendations are some basic, sensible actions we can take company-wide, but it is up to every employee to look for cost saving measures and do what makes sense in your daily activities.  If you have an idea or a suggestion you would like to share with us, please e-mail us at recommendationsforcostsavings@enron.com.   A list of questions and answers about these policies is posted on http://ibuyit.enron.com/gss/ibuyit/csfaq.doc.  If you have additional questions, Policy Committee member Kevin Hannon will host an eSpeak on Tuesday, June 19 at 10 a.m. Houston time to discuss these cost saving recommendations.

Hi Harry:


Just a quick note. I found this opening earlier on Enron's website.
Now I can't get to the particular page on the website, hence I am faxing
you the details.

Have a look and let me know if you think it makes sense to apply for
this.
I
Best wishes,
Gurmeet

Hey Harry,


 1. Volatility smile is calculated based on (contract_price - fwd_price).    If we denote this difference as d, then compare it with the volatility smile curves based on the following rules:

   To make it clear, let's assume the volatility smile curve is for -1.5, -1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5

   a) if d is between the smallest and biggest scale in the curve, namely -1.5 and 1.5, then it is mapped to the closest scalar smaller than it.  This means for d>0, say, d = 1.2, it is mapped to 1;  for d<0, say d= -1.2, it is mapped to -1.5.

   b) if d is greater than the maximum scalar in the curve, it is mapped to the maximum scalar, 1.5 in this example.

   c) if d is less than the smallest scalar in the curve, it is mapped to the smallest scalar, -1.5 in this example.

2.  Volatility smile is calculated in the same way regardless of the deal types.

3.  For Houston deals, volatility smile is always applied.
 

Sanjay

Hi,
I'm working with Dave Forster to put together an Originator's Toolkit, that will contain a description of various products (many from Janelle's Product Descriptions) that the originators and mid marketers can offer customers.  Since many of the products are option based I'd like to run the toolkit by you all to look over.  I'd appreciate any comments.  Also if there are any additional products that I should add please let me know.
Thanks,
Max

This is a good web site which has a decent explanation of the power markets and is also divided in chapters.

Harry,
Tom has drafted a document accompanying the option model. It should
be helpful for other people who sees the model the first time.

Hi Stephanie,

Harry called because the ID we gave him for the test applications does not seem to be working. Can you inactivate the first one and email him a new one. Thanks.

Hey Nicole-
I got your email via Steve Wang-- he actually came to
me with it-- did you send it along?

It was great meeting you this weekend-- what a wild
night-- was really a great party.

I'm sending my resume along-- just had a page maker
competent friend tweak it--- looks pretty flash!

Thanks so much for your help-- I look forward to
seeing you again!

Harry,
Sorry for the  delay.  Here is our Business Plan.  As you can see, we are in the  Vidigo Compression business.  We have developed a proprietary compression  capability which produces video of superior quality and size with approximately  half the file size resulting in substantial cost savings.  We have also  developed proprietary marketing applications based on our core technology  ie.VidiMercial and Vidigo Previews. We are currently looking for a bridge  financing on the order of $2m which should carry us to cash flow positive.   We are now beginning to roll out our technology.   I would be glad to meet  you.  I look forward to hearing from you.
Regards,

Iris,

Attached is a file originally prepared by Janelle Scheuer of the NE Origination group. Note that it summarises products from a fairly high-level perspective and focuses on end result to the customer.

This is being incorporated into a new Toolkit binder, along with a summary sheet which will be similar to the following examples:
