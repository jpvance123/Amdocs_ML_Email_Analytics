it's possible that we could get pulled into the chevron matter but with our 
limited usage - i doubt it.  i would not look any further.  

Duke probably is required to facilitate the TW remediation but likely is not 
required to maintain the lease...roger - is it possible to contact Duke and 
find out what their plans are and if they intend to abandon - possibly get 
them to assign or sublease a portion of the site to us???

Subject: TW N. Crawar Remediation

Lou,

In advance of installing several off-site wells for a remediation system at 
the N. Crawar site, Roger Westbrook has contacted the property owner in order 
to obtain off-site access for the installation of wells and other associated 
activities. I believe Roger offered $2500 for a five year term. The property 
owner has indicated that Duke Energy (the current facility owner) has 
indicated that Duke plans to release the property lease since they no longer 
utilize this facility. Furthermore, the property owner has put off entering 
into an access agreement with TW pending further information regarding Duke's 
plans for the lease. Roger suspects that the property owner wants more for 
damages to replace the lost revenue that was generated by the lease. This 
brings up the following questions. Does Duke have an obligation to maintain 
the lease until TW is done with remediation activities? If Duke releases the 
lease, does TW need to obtain a lease for remediation activities? 

Another issue related to this site. The property owner asked Roger about the 
quantity of water that would be recovered in the course of remediation at 
this site. Apparently the town of Crane, Texas owns the water rights in this 
area and has a pending suit against Chevron and the property owner for 
contamination of the aquifer. I have noticed several monitor wells in the 
area just east and northeast of the TW site. These wells are spaced out over 
quite a large area. My best guess would be that Chevron had a problem with 
one or more injection wells to create such a widespread problem. We've got 
good monitoring data that shows that the lateral extent of affected 
groundwater at the TW site is very limited. Do we run the risk of getting 
pulled into something bigger just for being there? Is this an issue that 
needs to be investigated further? Last year sometime I asked someone at the 
RRC District 8 office about the Chevron monitor wells and they were not 
familiar with them.

Larry, the attached file contains a scanned image of a story that was 
published in The Monahans News, a weekly paper, on Thursday, April 20, 2000. 
I've shown the story to Bill, and he suggested that you let Rich Jolly know 
about the story.

Thanks, George

Roger-

The attached file contains a two page summary of the remediation efforts at 
the former TW North Crawar facility. I have placed two hard copies of this 
letter and the associated site diagrams on your desk. Please feel free to 
either copy and paste this information into a separate letter from you to the 
landowner or to present my letter as an attachment to your letter, whichever 
way you feel is best.

-George

We will require off-site access for the installation of 10 remediation wells 
at the North Crawar facility (formerly owned by TW but now owned by Duke). I 
will drop off in your office a site diagram that indicates the location of 
the wells relative to the facility and the existing wells. I believe that the 
adjacent property owner had been contacted prior to well installations in 
August 1997, but I am not familiar with the details of the access agreement 
or even who within ET&S made the arrangements. We are shooting for 
early-October for the well installations. We may also want to address 
continued access to the wells in an agreement with the landowner (a 5-10 year 
term should be sufficient). Give me a call at x67327 if you have any 
questions.
Thanks,
George

We have received the water well survey for the N. Crawar site. The Crane 
County Water District owns 11 water wells within a one mile radius of the 
site. The nearest well is located about 1000 feet east of the site. It 
appears that all of the wells are completed into the uppermost aquifer and, 
in general, are screened from 50' bgs to total depth at about 140' bgs. The 
shallow water table at the site and in the nearby wells is at about 50' bgs. 
The groundwater flow direction at the site has consistently been toward due 
south. There are no water supply wells within one mile due south of the site. 
There are two monitor wells at the east side of the site which have always 
produced clean samples. The remediation system for this site should be 
operational by April 1, 2001. We will also have more current groundwater 
sampling information for the site within the next few weeks.

Larry-
Two files are attached. The first file includes a project scope and cost 
estimate for 2001. The second file contains two photos of the SVE system that 
was recently started-up. 

The cost estimate is $130,000. This figure includes only contract 
installation dollars, so the work order amount would be about 20-30% more 
than this. The bulk of this figure ($75,000) is for installation of 14 
additional remediation wells. I think we should keep-up an aggressive 
schedule with this site due to the close proximity of the Crane County water 
wells.

Give me a call and lets discuss.

-George
