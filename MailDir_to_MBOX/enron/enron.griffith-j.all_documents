This agreement should be split and attach individually to each of the two 
swaps.  The monetization should therefore not be dependent on both of them 
having occurred but only of the one relevant to that particular credit letter.

Mary Lynne/John,

Just wanted to follow up on my earlier e-mail.  I re-ran my calculation for 
the Enron Cost of Funds/Deal Cost versus Libor.  The following reconciles 
this calculation:

 Difference between Libor and ENE Cost of Funds    $5,131,161
 Difference between ENE Cost of Funds and Deal Spread (87.5 bps)  $2,491,673

 Total Difference between Deal and Libor     $7,622,834

Sorry for the mistake and again, please let me know if there are any 
questions. Thanks.

Mike

Mary Lynne,

Just wanted to updated you on the current prepay that is scheduled to close 
next thursday (28th) with Chase and Fleet.  The prepay is anticipated as 
follows:

Total Funds      $330,000,000
Financing Expenses:
 Upfront to Banks $2,582,500
 Surety Bonds  $2,175,670
  Total Fees         $4,758,170

Anticipated Cash Flow    $325,241,830

The anticipated reserve related to ENE cost of funds versus the prepay is  
estimated to be ($130,501) while the timing differential between delivery 
date and settlement date (55 days) is estimated to be ($2,949,879).  Please 
let me know if you have any questions or need any additional information.  
Thanks again for your help.

Michael

the sitara tic #555941 [Bank of America] should not exist.  there should no

Brazos is buying 100% of the physical gas.  BofA is buying zero.  The sitara

Subject: St. Mary's FEB First of the Month Nom, Myette Point Northwest Field
 St. Mary Parish, LA


for feb,

VPP gas: sitara tic #541136 shows 11,136/d, when it should really be 11,480/d.

The other 344/d is on sitara tic #555941; the two tickets together total 
11,480/d.  You'll remember that the Bank of America tics were established by 
John Griffith's team.

and re the excess gas tics [below], they do not match my first of the month 
[FOM] info below.  Did the FOM change?  

The nom was in fact changed by Hunt at 2:00 pm on 1/31/2001.  Hunt had 
inadvertantly provided you with North Central's nomination for the low volume 
meter, 9502, instead of Preston's nomination.  Thus, the 2,997/d on the North 
Central page (note the 25% WI on your original documentation - I missed this 
clue also) provided to us on 1/25/2001 became 2,012/d on the Preston page 
provided to us on 1/31/2001.

The GDA tic s/b 10% of the total excess amount, and this is less than that.  
Am I missing something?

The Gas Daily ticket won't necessarily be 10% of the total.  Here's what we 
do.  We book the VPP volume on one set of firm tickets (actually 2 sets, 
since the VPP has been broken into a Brazos traunch and a Bank of America 
traunch) - see 541136, 555941, 553654 & 555681 (the last two tickets are the 
internal desk to desk deals).  Then, based on Robert Cook's team's reserve 
review, we book as much excess gas on a second set of firm tickets as the 
reserve report indicates (the Firm Excess volume) - in this case, for the 
month of February, that number is 4,618/d - see 540814 & 594648.  Finally, we 
"book" any residue remaining after the VPP volume and the Firm Excess volume 
on a set of spot, Gas Daily tickets - see 554222 & 555729.  Originally, when 
we mistakenly thought the nomination at meter 9502 was 2,997/d, the 
corresponding spot, Gas Daily volume was 17,216/d minus 11,480/d minus 
4,618/d or 1,118/d.  When the renomination of meter 9502 (a downward 
adjustment of 985/d) took place, the 1,118/d became 133/d.  Thus, the total 
booked, 16,231/d matches the 16,231/d nominated. 

Excess gas priced at IF: sitara tic #540814
Excess gas priced at GDA: sitara tic #554222 

For your information, we deliver herewith a copy of the spreadsheet we will 
use to track this deal for February.



thanks George x3-6992

George,

This is a follow up to the hard copies of the first of the month information 
that I put on your chair earlier today.  Below is a summary/break out of the 
volumes and pricing.

The VPP nom should be in the name of Brazos, and the excess in Preston's 
name.  Do you know has Hunt been informed that the VPP nom will be in Brazos' 
name?

It does not matter to me how you break out the VPP vols between the 2 
delivery points - whatever is easiest for you.



This spreadsheet is the same as what is above....

The new, 1-15 December edition of designzine.com  includes the kind of 
articles on cutting-edge subjects and ideas that readers  of our member 
'zines have come to expect. For example, find out everything you  ever wanted 
to know about the outspoken Murray Moss and were afraid to ask,  in 
Intramuros.  Maria Bottero discusses the pioneer Bucky Fuller, in Abitare.  
And then there's the short survey, "Filming Hotels," by Silvana 
Annicchiarico,  in Modo.

In addition to these articles, there are more than  15 others with all the 
text and all the images from the latest issues of our  nine members. And 
remember that the Calendar  remains definitive.

In case you have designstand.com  coupons you wish to redeem, take a stroll 
down the aisles of the store to see  if there's something you want to pick 
out for the coming holidays. The virtual  doors of designstand.com, whose 
paint  may still be wet, have just swung open. 

Cordially,

Mel Byars

John, 

Doug called me with a question regarding the Historical Henry Hub price: Are 
those monthly gas prices as of NYMEX contract expiration date?  For example, 
Jan. 2001 contracts expire on 12/31/2000.  He wants to make sure that the 
12/31/2000 gas price is actually for Jan. 2001 contracts.  Thanks!

Ying

John:

Thanks for the update.  However, the volumes have changed a bit.  That's my 
fault -  I didn't send them to you.  Not a huge change, but here they are:

Jan  24,644
Feb 22,259
Mar 24,644
Apr 23,849
May 24,644
Jun 23,849
Jul 24,644
Aug 24,644
Sep 23,849
Oct 24,644
Nov 23,849
Dec 24,644

I doubt this will change the notional price, but let me know.

Attached please find both a redlined and a clean version of the draft LOU and 
related Term Sheet for your review prior to our meeting on Monday (1/15).  
The Term Sheet is redlined against your 12/14 version and the LOU is redlined 
against John Scarlata's 1/3 version.  The document contains our position and 
recommendation on all of the previous issues as well as language to cover 
some additional items.  We recognize that some of our positions are different 
than yours.  We are willing to negotiate on most all of the issues, but in 
whole as opposed to piece meal.  We are looking forward to meeting again on 
Monday.  See you then!

Regards,
Ed

PS  I will be out of the office tomorrow and I expect Gil will be out as well 
home recovering from an illness.  We will be checking voice mail 
periodically, so leave a message if you need to talk prior to Monday.  
Furthermore, if you need to contact us prior to the meeting, we will be at 
the Short Hills Hilton on Sunday night.

John,
I now switched the sign of moneyness as you said, and coded it as Strike - 
MidPrice.
Calls see 1086678(with skew) and puts see 1086682(with skew), The ones 
without skew are the same as yesterday.

Helloo, my beautiful Houston kittens!!

Here's a link to some of the photos from my third-to-last night in Texas:
http://albums.photopoint.com/j/AlbumIndex?u=155943&a=11400679

Thanks so much to those of you who made it out to our going-away party last
night. I'm sorry that not everybody could be there, but I understand and
hope you're feeling better. And thanks to everybody for your friendship and
support over the years. Anyway, I had a great time at the party, even when I
fell on my head while trying to do a keg stand. I wish I'd had more time to
spend with each of you. I feel honored to be able to call you my friends,
and I hope the distance between us won't change that. Please keep in touch
with me, let me know how you're doing, and come visit me in California.
We'll go to the beach, and hang out with movie stars together.

xoxoxox,
Al Herrmann

With respect to the ECT Merchant Investments Corp. and ENA contract and the 
St. Mary's Production, LLC and ENA contract (Gary Bryan's "Preston" deal), 
Melissa Graves and I will assume responsibility for having our records and 
deals properly updated.  We would also be happy to perform the same task for 
the Entrada/Crescendo contracts if you wish.

In any event, we need copies of the conveyancing documents for at least the 
"Preston" deal and, if you wish us to update the Entrada/Cresendo deal also, 
the conveyancing documents for that deal too.

		 Subject: VPP's get syndicated


When the existing VPP's get syndicated into Brazos later this week, then they 
will be between Brazos [not Entrada] and Crescendo, and Brazos [not ECT 
Merchant...] and St. Mary's, who is the person responsible for making sure 
that the ENA contracts group makes the name change [assignment], and that 
everything in ENA's internal system - Sitara gets changed accordingly?  And 
also to make sure that these deals do not get duplicated?

thanks

we maybe slow, but we eventually get there,,

as you know Carr has been trying to get approval from within and from Enron
finance people to create margin financing to execute & clear Nymex (and

We would love the opportunity to renew our realtionship of executing and/or
clearing for you again.
We are told (by Sarah) that you would have to talk to your individual
finance person to get the particulars of this, but she told us that we are
basically approved.. If you have any question about this , please call..
Other than that any assistance we could be to help in this , let us know..

Jeremy,

Each day, we receive a report that shows the movement of the position's gamma 
with a change in the underlying (a gamma slide).  We would like to see how 
difficult it would be to see the same with vega (a vega slide).  Also, there 
is a report that shows totals for all the greeks by month.  Could you put a 
total line at the bottom of this report?  Please let me know of the 
difficulty of these changes. Thanks.

Will, consistent with the tickets we provided you earlier today, you entered 
the following deals with the volumes indicated in the column "11/28/00 
Tickets":


Tennessee    11/28/00    10/26/00
     Tickets    Quote

Baseload
Cabot:  #505762    11,280     9,136
D2D:  #505910

Swing:
Cabot:  #505855    2,820     2,284
D2D:  #505913

Transco

Baseload
Cabot:  #505870    14,720     14,400
D2D:  #505892

Swing
Cabot:  #505880    3,680     3,600
D2D:  #505902


But, the volumes cited in the tickets prepared today were not consistent with 
the volumes for which the East Desk originally provided price quotes based on 
the volumes we cited on 10/26/00.  I have spoken with Scott Neal and he is 
agreeable to allowing us to amend the Sitara deals to reflect the 10/26/00 
volumes rather than the 11/28/00 volumes.  Please, therefore, substitute the 
Quoted volumes for the Ticketed volumes on the 8 deals listed above.  Thanks 
much.

I have prepared and attach herewith revised tickets.

Jeff,

Following my discussion with Bob Hall earlier today, we've changed the two 
desk-to-desk tickets to reflect the full 100% volume - 14,100 Mmbtu/d on 
Tennessee and 18,400 Mmbtu/d on Transco.  A set of six tickets - 3 for each 
deal - is attached.   Please enter these tickets into Tagg and Sitara, or 
advise me if you require additional documentation.  Thanks.

1)  Is this deal done?  No, not yet.  Cabot is reviewing our new Enfolio long 
term contract and has suggested some minor modifications.  Also, this new 
long term contract form is awaiting final Legal Department approval - we 
expect this imminently.  Finally, our reservoir engineers are scheduled to 
visit Cabot's offices on 12/5/2000 to review their downhole data - we will 
not enter into a long term contract until a full reserve review has been 
completed.  
2)  What is the firm quantity?   The quantitiy should be fixed.  For 
December, the firm quantity on Tennessee is 11,280 Mmbtu/d, or 80% of the 
14,100 Mmbtu/d we expect to flow.  The firm quantity on Transco is 14,720 
Mmbtu/d, or 80% of the 18,400 Mmbtu/d we expect to flow.  We intend to keep 
the desk whole on these firm quantities.
3)  Who is communcating with Cabot from a logisitics/volume management point 
of view?  We expect to communicate with Cabot from a logistics/volume 
management point of view. 
4)  Why are we nominating ( instead of ENA Upstream) and which group is 
responsible for balancing on Tenn and Transco?  We intend to do whatever is 
necessary to get the gas to pipeline pooling points and thereupon turn it 
over to each Desk's logistics team.  We do not see the need to duplicate our 
existing logistics function.

Victor,

Are you guys nominating/confirming this gas on Tennessee Passkey and Transco 
Transit for December or are we?  We expect that as the deals are entered into 
Sitara, you will be asked to nominate and confirm this gas.

Are there going to be two sets of tickets for each deal (one for the firm 
volume and one for the swing)?  We'll need those deal numbers when you have 
them..  Actually, we've prepared 3 deal tickets for each deal.  One ticket is 
for the 80% firm purchase (first of the month index pricing) from Cabot by 
Upstream, the second ticket is for the 20% spot purchase (gas daily pricing) 
from Cabot by Upstream and the third ticket is the desk-to-desk transaction 
in which Upstream sells the 80% firm volume to the East Desk - this is the 
ticket which will generate origination to the Upstream Desk, if applicable.
   
Are you scheduling this internally in Unify or are we?  You are.

Sandy,

Attached are the tickets we intend to submit to document the two (2) deals 
with Cabot for December.  Once you and John have had an opportunity to review 
these tickets, Melissa and I would like to come down and walk them through 
the system.  Thanks.

Cabot has agreed to do the December deals at index minus $0.01 for 80% of 
their volume and gas daily minus $0.01 for the remaining 20% of their 
volume.  We expect that they will soon execute the long term paper providing 
for index minus $0.005 for the 80% firm traunch and gas daily minus $0.005 
for the 20% spot traunch; a set of new long term tickets will be prepared and 
submitted upon execution of the long term paper.

If this mechanism of documenting our deals works, we intend to submit all 
future deals in a similar manner.

Hi John:

Miles and Knippa just came back from visiting Kern River and gave me a new 
delivery point for this project.  We want to reprice the deal at OPAL.  I am 
attaching a small spreadsheet with a one year snapshot of monthly MMBtus for 
repricing it.  I would appreciate it if you send me the new gas price as soon 
as you get a chance.

Hope everything is going well.

Maria

We are approaching the final countdown as to signing our definitive agreement 
with El Paso regarding the sale of JEDI II's 51% interest in East Coast Power 
and ENA's $157.9mm of ECP Subordinated Notes.  

The transaction has continued to develop along the lines of my last update of 
11-21-00.  The terms and economics remain essentially as outlined on 
11-21-00.  In summary, the primary form of consideration will be a 
derivative-like commodity agreement or a 'contract for differences'.  This 
contract will be exchanged in full for the SubNotes and the majority of our 
equity interest.  The JEDI II equity interest will also receive a residual 
contingent interest which will become payable in the event of a PPA 
restructuring at the Linden facility.  We are calling the derivative a swap 
but it is more like a receivable.  An El Paso affiliate (guaranteed by El 
Paso as parent) will notionally be paying NYMEX plus approx $0.52 
(escalating) over seven years on a notional volume of 300,000 MMBtu/d and 
receiving NYMEX.  With netting the contract is simply a series of fixed 
quarterly payments over seven years.  No offset rights and no limitations on 
the guarantee - fully a stand alone agreement.  

We are optimistic that we may be able to sign documents as early as Thursday 
night.  This agreement can be terminated at our option in the event that we 
do not receive the necessary internal approvals.  There are only two 
significant external approvals required, a NJ Environmental 
'non-applicability' determination and ECP credit ratings reaffirmation.  
Accordingly we expect at this time to receive the necessary internal and 
external approvals and close by year end.  We expect that a public 
announcement would be appropriate at the time both parties have received all 
necessary internal approvals.

The portion of the commodity contract being exchanged for the SubNotes is 
expected to be offered to Condor to monetize this portion of the contract at 
year end.  Subsequent to Condor's acquisition of its contract, both JEDI II's 
contract and the Condor contract are expected to be monetized in a QSPE 
vehicle later in the first quarter.  

Please call or email with any questions you may have.  Thanks for your 
assistance in these matters.

My view on the discussions with Southern Co. is that it is one of several 
potential ways to get at some upside out of our rights at Elba Island.  It's 
also giving us a good indication of where the market is for gas sourced from 
LNG coming in to Elba.  Nothing will be committed to without considering all 
the alternatives at Elba and a full review within EGM and asumably ENA.  The 
discussions are still, in my view, exploratory.

Thanks

Tony,

Whats up?  Hey I think that Mexico is playing US tomorrow in Ohio for the
World Cup qualifying.  Is Mexico any good?  Should we wager on the match?
Hope things are going well with you.  Talk to you soon.

My work number is (713) 853-6247 if you want to call me anytime.  I got a
promotion.  I am now trading Natural Gas Options.  We trade them over the
internet also.  We have a website (Enron Online) that we make markets on
many different commodities and we just started making option markets in
natural gas a couple of months ago.  I am helping with this.

Tell your family hi and have a great day.

Colleen and Greg,

I talked to Zimin today and he agreed with me on the change to the model.  
There are basically 3 columns in the model that need to be changed.  Let me 
know when you want to get together to make the change and run parallel.  
Thanks.

John

Hello John!!  HOw are you ?? How was your Holiday ?  Yes, there has been a 
tremendous ammount of talks about the Industrials asking for subsidies and 
help from the government to help lower the costs of gas...  They were asking 
for a fixed price of gas @ $3.00, or even $4.00, but the final decision was a 
loan to finance the cost of gas between IFERC and $4.00, to be paid over a 3 
to 4 year plan....I guess the final decision is not so harmful for us because 
we can still sell the derivatives, and it is a short term decision,,,What is 
really concerning me is all the noise behind it..The industrials are still 
pushing for a subsidy or a change in formula and the government is listening, 
so basically a lot of clients could eventually decide not to hedge in the 
meantime....Anyway, when do you have sometime to talk about chihuahua ? Let 
me know what is bets for you....Best regards.

Hey guys, 

Happy new year!! How are things going?  I just read an article in NGI about 
the Mexico Energy Ministry looking to possibly financing rising gas costs for 
the Mexico's industrial sector.  How does this affect Enron in Mexico?  Is 
this something that they have been talking about for sometime now?  This is 
tough on competition, right?

Have a great day and talk to you soon.  Thanks.

John, 

The gas is off TW at West Texas Pool.  It is between 42,500 and 51,000 MMBtu 
per Month.  Starting Oct 1, 2001 and Ending May 1, 2010.  It is an expansion 
of the current Gallup deal.

Thanks

To further the process of reaching the stated objectives of increasing Enro=
n=20
America=01,s Velocity of Capital and associated Return on Invested Capital,=
 we=20
have decided to create a Capital Book. The Capital Book will have no profit=

target associated with it and will be managed by Joe Deffner. The purpose o=
f=20
creating this book is to ensure that all transactions within Enron Americas=
,=20
with any form of capital requirement, are structured correctly and are=20
allocated the appropriate cost of capital charge.=20

The previous numbers used in the Business Plans at the beginning of this ye=
ar=20
will remain for all transactions in place and where we hold assets.=20
Therefore, on any assets currently held within each business area, the=20
capital charge will remain at 15%. Internal ownership of these assets will =
be=20
maintained by the originating Business Unit subject to the Internal Ownersh=
ip=20
Policy outlined below.

The cost of capital associated with all transactions in Enron Americas will=
=20
be set by Joe. This process is separate and apart from the current RAC=20
process for transactions which will continue unchanged.

Capital investments on balance sheet will continue to accrue a capital char=
ge=20
at the previously established rate of 15%. Transactions which are structure=
d=20
off credit will receive a pure market pass through of the actually incurred=
=20
cost of capital as opposed to the previous 15% across the board charge.=20
Transactions which are structured off balance sheet, but on credit will be=
=20
priced based upon the financial impact on Enron America=01,s overall credit=
=20
capacity.

On transactions that deploy capital through the trading books, the Capital=
=20
Book will take a finance reserve on each transaction, similar to the way th=
e=20
Credit Group takes a credit reserve. This finance reserve will be used=20
specifically to fund the capital required for the transaction. As noted=20
above, the Capital Book will have no budget and will essentially charge out=
=20
to the origination and trading groups at actual cost.

By sending market-based capital pricing signals internally, Enron America=
=01,s=20
sources of capital and liquidity should be better optimized across the=20
organization.=20

John,

The calcskew function was written in Excel VB for your option pricing model. 
The function has performed well for
the number of times it is used in your model. I took a look at your 
spreadsheet, and had a few IT programers take
a look at it as well. For the amount of times you're calling the function in 
the new spreadsheet, Excel VB is not 
the appropriate language for the function. My suggestion to you is that for 
these more calculation-intensive workbooks,
we use a function developed in C\C++.  I spoke with Paulo, and he will be 
looking into this, and will get in touch with you
today.

-Hector

Hector,

I just wanted to let you know that a floor tech looked at the file that had 
the calcskew function in it (the one I sent you).  I was having problems with 
Dr. Watson with the file.  I copied the contents to another workbook and had 
the same problems.  Either I didn't copy over the module correctly (vba), or 
there are some problems with the function (when it is used many times in a 
worksheet).  Please let me know what you think.  I am trying to use the 
function to value our entire portfolio during the day and until I get this 
worked out, I can't do it.  Thanks for your help.

Sincerely,

John Griffith

Sandy,

Attached are the tickets we intend to submit to document the two (2) deals 
with Cabot for December.  Once you and John have had an opportunity to review 
these tickets, Melissa and I would like to come down and walk them through 
the system.  Thanks.

Cabot has agreed to do the December deals at index minus $0.01 for 80% of 
their volume and gas daily minus $0.01 for the remaining 20% of their 
volume.  We expect that they will soon execute the long term paper providing 
for index minus $0.005 for the 80% firm traunch and gas daily minus $0.005 
for the 20% spot traunch; a set of new long term tickets will be prepared and 
submitted upon execution of the long term paper.

If this mechanism of documenting our deals works, we intend to submit all 
future deals in a similar manner.

What's the status here? Is the Agency Agreement a gas management contract? 
What is ENA's obligation and who is the point person internally on 
negotiating this? Rick Hill? Does ENA have exposure because this isn't yet 
executed? Please advise. Thanks.

John,
I have not heard from Rick on this draft. Did he send it to you? I had 
forwarded the initial draft to you, but we had a meeting and made some 
changes that resulted in this most recent draft. I forwarded it to Rick Hill 
and Darren Farmer for comments and have received none.Copied Rick on my 
earlier email to you to serve as a remeinfer to him. Did you have any 
comments?

Notice # 01-162
May 11, 2001

TO:
All NYMEX Division Members and Member Firms

FROM:
Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President

RE:
Reminder and Clarification on NYMEX Division Post-Close Trading Sessions

DATE:          May 11, 2001
===========================================================
Reminder
Changes will be going into effect today, Friday, May 11, 2001 for the End
of Week post-close trading sessions and also, beginning on Monday, May 14,
2001, for the Monday-Thursday post-close trading sessions. The trading
range for all of these sessions will be expanded by adding the following
ticks above (below) the daily high (low) for the applicable contract month
(provided that this expanded trading range does not violate the maximum
permissible price fluctuation limits then in effect):
Crude Oil      20 ticks
Heating Oil         50 ticks
Unleaded Gas        50 ticks
Natural Gas         50 ticks

Clarification
Previously, the trading range for the Monday-Thursday sessions was the
closing range for the applicable contract month. Exchange staff interpreted
the rule to provide that if a contract month did not trade during the
close, there would be no closing range and thus it would not be permissible
to trade that contract month during the post-close.  Now, as noted above,
the post-close session trading range on any day of the week will be an
expanded version of the daily range. Therefore, the Exchange is issuing the
following clarifications as to the contract months that can be traded
during a post-close session (on any day of the week):

1.   Only the first twelve listed contract months are eligible for trading
in the post-close.

2.   If a particular contract month does not trade during the RTH session,
it may not be traded during the post-close.

3.   It is not necessary for a contract month to trade during the close in
order to be traded in the post-close as long as it has traded during the
RTH session.

If you have any questions concerning these changes, please contact George
Henderson, Vice President, NYMEX Floor Department, at (212) 299-2071; Rob
Stasi, Manager of Trading Floor Systems, NYMEX Floor Department, at (212)
299-2067, or Brian Regan, Senior Associate General Counsel, at (212)
299-2207.

Doug,

As we discussed, I am trying to get a feel for pricing if an insurance
company or companies  were to hedge some potential price exposures.
Please assume that the credit quality of your counterparty is A rated
or better.  Attached are some hypothetical volumes to hedge.  The
actual volumes hedged may be less or more.  I would sugest we look at a
cap and a swap (pay fixed, receive floating).  It would be appreciated
if you would please provide some indicative quotes.

If you need more please let me know.

Thanks.

Best regards,

Bob

Notice No:  01-88
March 8, 2001


NYMEX BOARD EXTENDS PROPRIETARY FEE REDUCTION PROGRAM

At its meeting on March 7, 2001, the NYMEX Board of Directors determined to
extend the current Proprietary Fee Reduction Program ("Program") through
April 30, 2001.

Pursuant to the Program, Member Firms and individuals members who own seats
will have their NYMEX Division fees reduced by 12 cents per round turn (6
cents per trade side).

Individual members who lease their seats, or hold a membership under an ABC
Agreement, will have their NYMEX Division fees reduced by 2.5 cents per
round turn (or 1 ? cents per trade side).

Clearing Members who clear Member Firm trades should adjust their billing
systems accordingly.

Clearing Members clearing floor members' accounts should not adjust their
billing systems for such individual members.  NYMEX issues payments
directly to individual members based upon their trading activity.

Floor members who execute Type 3 trades are asked to pay special attention
to NYMEX Rule 6.18 (B) (ii), requiring the executing member to report the
alpha code (badge symbol) of the receiving member on PTS.

Should you have any questions regarding this matter, please feel free to
contact M. Dawn Lowe or Donna Talamo at (212) 299-2370.

Subject: Southern Confirmation Letters

Attached please find a red-line redraft of the Confirmation Letters.  I 
understand that Enron will not sign the confirmation letters with Southern 
until Enron North America Corp. has finalized its arrangements with the Elba 
Island Terminal entity having the gas available at the tailgate of the Elba 
Island facility.  Is this correct.  If so, I do not need to make ENA's 
contract with such entity a condition precedent to the Southern Confirmation 
Letters.  Please advise.

Lia, Jay Hartman (281.367.8697) has verbally advised us that the SL 14521 #1 
well will be shut-in for a short period and has therefore requested that we 
reduce the existing nomination for 01/2001 at TGT meter 9502 on sitara deal 
540814 from 316 Mmbtu/d (13% of 2,434 Mmbtu/d) to 0.  You indicated you will 
reduce the nomination to 0 for the entire month; we will notify you once 
production re-commences and the nomination should be re-entered at its 
previous level.

Jill, this gas was purchased from Hunt in December by the East Desk, so no 
Wellhead Desk changes are required for this month.

Sam, the counterparty record for St. Mary's Production LLC (BA 88272) does 
not include a DnB status.  It is my understanding that our East Desk cannot 
schedule St. Mary's gas without a DnB number.  Could you please have a DnB 
number established for St. Mary's Production LLC?  Thanks.

Due to the holidays, I sent a copy of this note to both Mary and Jason.

Eric (Moon) and John, attached are the tickets for the physical part of the 
Preston VPP deal.  Please work with Will Kelly to have them entered into 
Sitara and provide me with the deal numbers.

Eric (Wardle), we'll need to get contract numbers established for the 
Counterparty Firm Agreement (ECT Merchant Investments) and the Counterparty 
Spot Agreement (St. Mary's Production LLC).  Have either of these agreements 
yet been executed?  If not, should we generate a spot gtc for the St. Mary's 
spot production?

Corp. has arranged for the Enron North America Upstream Wellhead Desk to 
manage the sale, nomination and transport of this production.

Could you please get us a quote to purchase this wellhead gas on a firm basis 
based on the following:

a.  30 month term commencing 1/1/2001 and ending 6/30/2003

b.  firm purchase and firm transport for 90% of the wellhead volume, starting 
at 90% of 11,567 per day and declining as defined on the last tab labelled 
"Volume" on the spreadsheet attached

c.  gas daily purchase and interruptible transport for the remaining 10% of 
the wellhead volume

Enron Upstream will keep the desk financially whole should volumes for the 
90% firm component fail to show up on any given day of the 18 month term

Drafts of proposed Deal Tickets are attached.

There should not be a deal tic for BOA [555941].  The Brazos tic #541136 has 
100% of the VPP vols, which is correct.  The other tic should not exist.  I 
have been told that you were the one to input it in, so I am trying to find 
out what needs to be done to remove it.  It is not correct.

Joan,

The BOA ticket was established by John Griffith.

Two deal tickets are necessary for St. Mary's in order to segregate that 
portion of the excess volumes on which a firm delivery guarantee to the East 
Desk was made and origination was taken from that portion of the excess 
volumes which are delivered to the desk on an interruptible basis and priced 
accordingly.

100% of the VPP vols, which is correct.  The other tic should not exist.  I 
am not sure if you put this in, or if John Griffith did this when the name 
change from St. Mary's to Brazos took place.  Please let me know what I need 
to do in order to get this removed/corrected. 

Also, when things slow down, we need to discuss the 2 deal tics [firm and 
spot].  Per the contract with Preston, there s/b only one tic - all the gas 
at IF TGT + 0.0025.

thanks.

Nice to meet you this morning.  

Attached is a file containing the hardcopy data that John Griffith, Eric Boyt 
and I provided.  The gas trader expects the transaction to close today--we'll 
keep you posted.



In this transaction we owe gas to National Steel at far below current

A couple of the transaction documents are coming together a little more 
slowly than anticipated yesterday.  After an all day drafting session today 
there remain only a few manageable issues left to resolve.  Accordingly we 
have tentatively scheduled signing the definitive agreements on Monday 4-Dec. 
 

Currently both parties have a termination right for internal approvals - El 
Paso approvals may be complete by Monday and I would like to have ours 
completed as well so that this termination right could be eliminated.  Please 
let me know what other information/documentation you will need so that we may 
complete our approval processes and sign these agreements on Monday without 
this clause.

Thanks again for your timely assistance with this transaction.

Hey you two,
?
Yes, this email is business - Lawndale business.? I'm not really accustomed 
to talking business with my friends so let me say right at the beginning that 
should you not be interested in the following, no harm, no foul.? The last 
thing I want to do is create any discomfort but I really think that this 
might be something that you'd be interested in.? 
?
First, I'm organizing a show at Lawndale that will open on March 9th in the 
Main Gallery called Colorforms.? It's going to include 3 painters - 2 from 
Dallas and 1 from New York - and one sculptor - maybe you know her: Jessica 
Halonen?? She's a core fellow.? I'm really excited about the show.? I did 
studio visits with three of the artists this past weekend and they're all 
working on great stuff.? I'm so jazzed about it, that I've been inspired to 
write an essay and I haven't written about art in 6 years!Anyway, I'm trying 
to do something a little more substantial for the gallery notes - more than 
just a folded piece of card stock - and I told Lawndale that I would try and 
fund-raise for it.? I'm mentioning this to you only because you have 
expressed interest in the past in helping out if I am putting any projects 
together.? I'm trying to raise about $250 to cover printing costs.? I'd also 
like to have a DJ at the ! opening - maybe Patrick Phipps - but I need to 
fund-raise for his fee too.? I know you're thinking "what about DJ Grils 
Baloy" and I'd like to do it but I'm thinking that I need to circulate 
amongst the guests at a show that I organized.? 
?
Second, I'm co-chairing Lawndale's Mid-Century Market this year and so I'm 
also fund-raising for it.? There is a formal letter/packet that has been put 
together but I thought I would ask you a little less formally if you're 
interested in supporting the event.? Last year the Market did quite well 
based on booth rentals and admission.? This year we're focusing on increasing 
the number of donors to the event which has traditionally been small.? There 
are several levels of support with varying benefits at each level.? All 
proceeds from the event go directly to Lawndale's operating budget.
?
As you can tell, I've been increasing my involvement with Lawndale, trying to 
help them get through this period of growing pains.? I regret the fact 
that?these events - Colorforms and the Market? - are happening so close 
together purely from an "asking" point-of-view, but they both seem to have 
"John and Angie" written all over them.? However, if this just isn't a good 
time for you to be doing this sort of thing then I completely understand.? 
Nonetheless, I hope that they might pique your interest.? I'll look forward 
to hearing from you.
?

HI John and Angie!

Hope you are both doing well!

McGowan on Chenevert--2503 Chenevert, 713 759-0819.  Hope to see you soon!

Happy Holidays!

John:

The reason for the large Vega numbers on the TopPage report, while there were 
no corresponding changes in the Volatility curves, is due to the change in 
the mid. price for the current day versus the prior day. The corresponding 
volatility skews that are added to the vols. for the 2 days is causing the 
large vega numbers.

For example, for deal number QV5087.2 (exp. date 01-Jan-2002):

  Current Day  Prior Day
Mid. Price 5.885   5.772
Strike Price 3.5   3.5
Mid - Strike 2.385   2.272
Vol.  0.555   0.555
Vol. Skew 0.03816   0.03635
Actual Vol. 0.59316   0.59135

Option value for prior day using current day's vol. =  7,616,935  
Option value for prior day using prior day's vol.     =  7,547,238 
Vega                =  69,697

Thank you,
Jeremy

Unfortunately we have been unable to reach closure on the third party 
conditions, namely the ISRA and Bayonne consents, to our Transaction 
Agreement with El Paso.  We have therefore negotiated an extension of the 
deadline.  The terms of the extension include a non-refundable deposit to be 
paid to us by El Paso under certain circumstances and an extension to 
22-Feb.  Hopefully the extension will allow sufficient time for these two 
remaining conditions to be satisfied.  This extensio is expected to be 
finalized tomorrow.

John,

Connectiv and Idacorp have been approved; Paribas does not trade on EOL; 
Vitol is declined due to weak credit.  We'll get back to you with the others 
soon.  I left a message for Dave Forster as well.

RV Comment regarding longer portion of curve:

Recap:
1. DNH1 / DNM1 continues to trade somewhat expensive, DNM1 basis is fair
given FF futures ("new & improved" levels)
2. FNMA benchmarks and FHLMC reference notes from 1/09 thru 9/10 are
trading at attractive levels relative to Libor
- likely will not improve much before quarter end
3. USM1 and TYM1 basis:
a. USM1 basis closed cheap across the board (especially given FF
futures)
b. TYM1 basis continues to trade rich
4. GSE issues longer than 15 years contnue to suffer relative to Libor
(trading Libor plus 2 to 4)
5. FHLMC issued $2bn sub-debt 10yrs approx 22 over 10year FHLMC (approx
L+14)

Comments:
1. DNM1 vs E$ strips (swaps) represent very attractive risk/reward profile
- prefer E$ strips instead of swaps because of our opinon on
volatility and ability to discretely manage
duration variability of CTD of DNM1
- we have seen interest in this trade & variants of this trade
2. We view the UST 5.5 5/09 as expensive vs the TYM1, although FF currently
offer no protection against rampant Fed eases
3. We view the USM1 basis as cheap
- prefer owning "non-CTD" issues (e.g. Aug17s and Feb23s) rather than
'20 & '21 issues
- FF futures should provide reasonable repo hedges for these positions
4. FNMA anouncement (tomorrow) of new 10yrs - look for announcement on the
smaller side ... comparable issues trading L-9 or so, relatively expensive
funding for FNMA
5. GSE issues > 15 years continue to lag everything
- unless and until the curve helps out - and - liquidation of
positions acquired considerably above the market

Nope, not this time around.  No movie star.
Other then the work stuff, things are going well for me too.
I'm glad to hear that all is well for you (ferrarri and all...).  Do you
think they'll give me a car too if I
work for them?
In regards to space, I know what you mean.  I needed so much that I am no
longer married.  It was
not an easy decission or thing to do, but definetely the right one.  I've
been living in South Beach
for the past 8 months and lived with my mom for a little while before that.
Butch is doing well.  He is not reporting to Pedro anymore.  He is under a
new manager under
Ana doing web stuff.  He's been working extremely long hours and under a
lot of preassure.
They had to release new hardware.  I don't think things went very well.
I'll let him know you say hi.

Anyway...I'll call you next week and for sure you will be the 2nd, or maybe
third to know if I make it
out to Houston.

Don't work too hard.

Did they think that you were a movie star at the Sushi Bar?  How are things
going?  It is good to here from you.

I haven't travelled at all, I am now trading natural gas options here at
Enron.  I have been really busy.  I get into work around 6:15 and work
until about 6 on the evening.  I don't even leave my desk for lunch.  They
bring it to me.  I only have a chance to leave my desk for the special
things (haha).

I hope that you are well.  I still miss Florida and all my Floridian
buddies, but things are going well here.  My job is going really well
(promotion, big bonus, company ferrarri....).  Just kidding about the car.
But really everything is going well.  I just miss getting away.  Marriage
is good, but I think that everyone needs their space sometimes (you know
what I mean).

Well I better go.  Call me sometime. My work number is (713) 853-6247.  If
you every make it to Houston be sure to let me know.  Talk to you soon.

John

PS  How is Butch doing?  Tell him hi

I just heard back from credit.... No e-dash is required.  So just let us know 
if you are wanting to transact today and we will speak with Mike.

Subject: City of Mesa Update

Dave/Jeff,

I spoke with Jason Williams (Enron Credit) and he confirmed there will be no 
credit reserve on the new index deal.  He is verifying that there is no need 
to "e-dash" the deal.  I will get back to you as soon as I hear word.  If one 
is required, we will help get the document pushed through the system.

The next step, if you and the City of Mesa are ready, is to get a firm quote 
from Mike Grigsby this afternoon.

Let me know.

Regards,

Eric


PS - Attached is an e-dash.  If one is needed, you will need to complete the 
first section describing the deal.  As you can tell by the matrix, it does 
not appear an e-dash is necessary because the City of Mesa has a AA- rating 
and the transaction is approx $8 million and less than 1 year.

Errol:

As per my conversation with John, for today's calc. of his option book, the 
prior day portion of the calc. will be using the vol. skew that was 
mistakenly loaded by Margie yesterday. The current day portion of the calc. 
will be using the original vol. skew that John loaded on Mar. 30, 2001.

Tomorrow, both the current and prior day portion of the calc. will use John's 
original vol. skew.

Thanks,
Jeremy

Victor,

Are you guys nominating/confirming this gas on Tennessee Passkey and Transco 
Transit for December or are we?  We expect that as the deals are entered into 
Sitara, you will be asked to nominate and confirm this gas.

Are there going to be two sets of tickets for each deal (one for the firm 
volume and one for the swing)?  We'll need those deal numbers when you have 
them..  Actually, we've prepared 3 deal tickets for each deal.  One ticket is 
for the 80% firm purchase (first of the month index pricing) from Cabot by 
Upstream, the second ticket is for the 20% spot purchase (gas daily pricing) 
from Cabot by Upstream and the third ticket is the desk-to-desk transaction 
in which Upstream sells the 80% firm volume to the East Desk - this is the 
ticket which will generate origination to the Upstream Desk, if applicable.
   
Are you scheduling this internally in Unify or are we?  You are.

volume and one for the swing)?  We'll need those deal numbers when you have 
them.. 
Are you scheduling this internally in Unify or are we? 
Please let me know as soon as possible as noms for December 1 are due to the 
pipelines by 11:30 this Thursday morning!  THANKS!

Sandy,

Attached are the tickets we intend to submit to document the two (2) deals 
with Cabot for December.  Once you and John have had an opportunity to review 
these tickets, Melissa and I would like to come down and walk them through 
the system.  Thanks.

Cabot has agreed to do the December deals at index minus $0.01 for 80% of 
their volume and gas daily minus $0.01 for the remaining 20% of their 
volume.  We expect that they will soon execute the long term paper providing 
for index minus $0.005 for the 80% firm traunch and gas daily minus $0.005 
for the 20% spot traunch; a set of new long term tickets will be prepared and 
submitted upon execution of the long term paper.

If this mechanism of documenting our deals works, we intend to submit all 
future deals in a similar manner.

George x3-6992

		 Subject: blacklined documents and closing checklist comments



Attached please find blacklined versions of the 5 documents that have
changed, based on the 12/15 comments that Melanie Wilson sent as well as the
subsequent conversation between Melanie, August Shouse and myself.  In
addition, the Guaranty has been further revised to reflect the June 2000
Guaranty as opposed to the June 1999 Guaranty.
 Milbank has raised the question as to whether the surety bonds are
assignable, and we understand from Enron that they are not assignable.  This
information has already been relayed by Joe Deffner to Jeffrey Dellapina.

 Milbank has also sent us a closing list.  What we have sent Milbank
includes:
  1.2- Margin Agreement
  1.3- Margin Price Confirmation Letter
  1.4- Enron Guaranty
  1.7- Consent and Agreement (Enron Corp)
  1.8- Consent and Agreement (ENAC)
  2.1- Forward Sale Agreement
  2.2- Confirmation Letter of Natural Gas Inventory Forward
Sale

 Additionally, we have sent Milbank a Letter Agreement regarding
duplicate delivery of information, which does not appear on the closing
list.
 We are not planning on drafting 1.1- Assignment Agreement, as is
currently reflected on the list.  We assume that Milbank is going to draft
this document.  We are also not doing 1.5- Surety Bond; the surety companies
will be doing those.  In addition, 3.1 and 4.1- Good Standing Certificates,
3.2 and 4.2- Secretary's Certificates have traditionally been handled by
Enron Corp.  Lastly, we are not planning on getting 5.1- Good Standing
certificates for Mahonia.

 We would also propose that Milbank reorganize the closing checklist
so that the gas sale transaction documents between Enron and Mahonia are in
one group.For example, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.7, 1.8, 2.1, 2.2 plus the
Letter Agreement regarding duplicate delivery of information should be in
one group regarding the forward sale contract, and all other documents
should be in one or more other groups.

 Please feel free to contact August Shouse or me with any questions
or comments.

John Griffith will be contacting you to follow up.  He is still managing some 
things until he is full time in Trading.  As such, he will be the structuring 
lead on the deal until further notice.  I will let you know who will take 
John's place when his transition is complete.  If you have any questions, 
please ask.

Hi, Ed,

How are you?  I am an Associate with ENA Generation Investments Group.  A 
couple of months ago, John Griffith helped us on the Indeck Corinth deal 
originated by Douglas Clifford.  Now, Doug is requesting updated NYMEX gas 
curves as well as the basis differential ANR and CNG North CG.   As John has 
transited out of your group, could you please tell me who I should contact?  

Thanks a lot for your help!

Joan,

The BOA ticket was established by John Griffith.

Two deal tickets are necessary for St. Mary's in order to segregate that 
portion of the excess volumes on which a firm delivery guarantee to the East 
Desk was made and origination was taken from that portion of the excess 
volumes which are delivered to the desk on an interruptible basis and priced 
accordingly.

George,

There should not be a deal tic for BOA [55941].  The Brazos tic #541136 has 
100% of the VPP vols, which is correct.  The other tic should not exist.  I 
am not sure if you put this in, or if John Griffith did this when the name 
change from St. Mary's to Brazos took place.  Please let me know what I need 
to do in order to get this removed/corrected. 

Also, when things slow down, we need to discuss the 2 deal tics [firm and 
spot].  Per the contract with Preston, there s/b only one tic - all the gas 
at IF TGT + 0.0025.

thanks.

Tony,

Whats up?  Hey I think that Mexico is playing US tomorrow in Ohio for the
World Cup qualifying.  Is Mexico any good?  Should we wager on the match?
Hope things are going well with you.  Talk to you soon.

My work number is (713) 853-6247 if you want to call me anytime.  I got a
promotion.  I am now trading Natural Gas Options.  We trade them over the
internet also.  We have a website (Enron Online) that we make markets on
many different commodities and we just started making option markets in
natural gas a couple of months ago.  I am helping with this.

Tell your family hi and have a great day.

John

John,

Could you please check whether the following HSC Gas Curve reflects our 
forward forecast about two months ago? (I am not quite sure from Chu Chu's 
model on what exact date he got the curve from the desk.  We believe it is 
about two months ago.)

2001 3.70
2002 3.20
2003 2.96
2004 2.91
2005 2.90
2006 2.91
2007 2.93
2008 2.96
2009 3.00
2010 3.05
2011 3.11
2012 3.19
2013 3.27
2014 3.36

Thanks!

Ying,

Here are the yearly curves for Houston Ship Channel.  These are indicative 
curves from 11/29/00.  They do not include the trader's bid/offer, or any 
costs that may be incurred in getting the gas to the plant.  
  

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.  Thanks.


John

What up, my peoples?!?

After Thursday, Jan. 04, I will no longer be able to receive email at
this address. The Chronicle has opted to cancel my contract, so I will
not be working fulltime for them anymore. I will continue to work here
parttime in graphics, at night, however. Please forward all new email to
me at herrmannal@hotmail.com  starting immediately. Please note this is
a new address, not to be confused with the bad spamful
al_herrmann@hotmail.com (bad! don't send mail there!)  Thank you for
your attention to this matter.

On a much happier note, on Monday Jan. 1st I got a phone call from an
adoption registry I had signed up with on a lark about a month ago. They
found my biological mother, who had been looking for me, and gave me her
phone no., name, etc. We've left phone messages for each other, and I
expect to talk w/ her maybe tonight. Pretty freaky, huh? I am in shock.

xox,
Al Herrmann, Extraordinaire

Subject: Wellhead Group [Gas]


There has been several discussions this past week as to who does what re the 
wellhead book, so I decided to write this out for everyone to understand.

>From now on, we will be going to the wellhead group in order to price out all 
of our wellhead supply.  Our main contact is John Grass.  John is the person 
whom we contact, and it is up to him to bring in someone from origination 
[Gary Bryan, Linda Roberts, Jill Zivley] or not, and he is the person who 
goes to the structuring group to get us our physical premium or discount.  
When it comes time to write up an excess contract or discuss/negotiate the 
excess pricing with the producer, our contact is John, and he will coordinate 
[with legal and origination] the discussions between ENA and the 
producer...of course, Tricia and I will be involved.

These are always funny.  Thought you might enjoy them.

The long awaited Darwin  Natural Selection Awards - Criminal Category have 
been released! ?These  awards are given each year to bestow upon that 
individual, who through  isolation by incarceration, has done the most to 
remove undesirable elements  from the human gene pool. 

RUNNER-UP # 9 Yankton, South Dakota: A woman  was arrested at her stepson's 
Boy Scout meeting. ?While watching a  policeman demonstrate his drug dog's 
ability, the dog found a bag of  marijuana in her purse. 

RUNNER-UP # 8 Colorado Springs: A guy walked  into a little corner store with 
a shotgun and demanded all the cash from the  cash drawer. ?After the cashier 
put the cash in a bag, the robber saw a  bottle of Scotch that he wanted 
behind the counter on the shelf. ?He  told the cashier to put it in the bag 
as 
well, but he refused and said  "Because I don't believe you are over 21." The 
robber said he was, but the  clerk still refused to give it to him because he 
didn't believe him.  ?At this point the robber took his drivers license out 
of 
his wallet  and gave it to the clerk. ?The clerk looked it over, and agreed 
that  the man was in fact over 21 and he put the Scotch in the bag. 
The robber  then ran from the store with his loot. ?The cashier promptly 
called the  police and gave the name and address of the robber that he got 
off 
the  license. ?They arrested the robber two hours later. 

RUNNER-UP # 7 A  woman was reporting her car as stolen, and mentioned that 
there was a car  phone in it. ?The policeman taking the report called the 
phone and told  the guy that answered that he had read the ad in the 
newspaper 
and wanted to  buy the car. ?They arranged to meet, and the thief was 
arrested.  

RUNNER-UP # 6 San Francisco: A man, wanting to rob a downtown Bank of  
America, walked into the branch and wrote "this iz a stikkup. ?Put all  your 
muny in this bag." While standing in line, waiting to give his note to  the 
teller, he began to worry that someone had seen him write the note and  might 
call the police before he reached the teller window. 
So he left  the Bank of America and crossed the street to Wells Fargo. 
After waiting a  few minutes in line, he handed his note to the Wells Fargo 
teller. ?She  read it and, surmising from his spelling errors that he was not 
the  brightest light in the harbor, told him that she could not accept his  
stickup note because it was written on a Bank of America deposit slip and  
that he would either have to fill out a Wells Fargo deposit slip or go back  
to Bank of America. ?Looking somewhat defeated, the man said "OK"  
and left. ?The Wells Fargo teller then called the police who arrested  the 
man 
a few minutes later, as he was waiting in line back at Bank of  America. 

RUNNER-UP # 5 From England: A motorist was unknowingly caught  in an 
automated 
speed trap that measured his speed using radar and  photographed his car. ?He 
later received in the mail a ticket for 40  Pounds and a photo of his car. 
Instead of payment, he sent the police  department a photograph of 40 pounds. 
? 
Several days later, he received  a letter from the police that contained 
another picture ...of handcuffs.  ?The motorist promptly sent the money for 
the fine. 

RUNNER-UP #  4 Drug Possession Defendant Christopher Jansen, on trial in 
March 
in  Pontiac, Michigan, said he had been searched without a warrant. ?The  
prosecutor said the officer didn't need a warrant because a "bulge" in  
Christopher's jacket could have been a gun. ?"Nonsense," said  Christopher, 
who happened to be wearing the same jacket that day in court.  ?He handed it 
over so the judge could see it. ?The judge  discovered a packet of cocaine in 
the pocket and laughed so hard he required  a five minute recess to compose 
himself. 

RUNNER-UP # 3 Oklahoma  City: Dennis Newton was on trial for the armed 
robbery 
of a convenience  store in district court when he fired his lawyer. 
Assistant District  Attorney Larry Jones said Newton, 47, was doing a fair 
job 
of defending  himself until the store manager testified that Newton was the 
robber.  ?Newton jumped up, accused the woman of lying and then said, "I 
should  of blown your (expletive) head off." The defendant paused, then 
quickly  added, "If I'd been the one that was there." The jury took 20 
minutes 
to  convict Newton and recommended a 30-year sentence. 

RUNNER-UP # 2  Detroit: R.C. ?Gaitlan, 21, walked up to two patrol officers 
who were  showing their squad car computer felon-location equipment to 
children in a  Detroit neighborhood. ?When he asked how the system worked, 
the 
officer  asked him for identification. ?Gaitlan gave them his driver's 
license,  they entered it into the computer, and moments later they arrested 
Gaitlan  because information on the screen showed Gaitlan was wanted for a  
two-year-old armed robbery in St. ?Louis, Missouri. 

RUNNER-UP #  1 Another from Detroit: A pair of Michigan robbers entered a 
record shop  nervously waving revolvers. ?The first one shouted, "Nobody 
move!" When  his partner moved, the startled first bandit shot him. 

THE WINNER A  Charlotte, NC, man having purchased a case of very rare, very 
expensive  cigars, insured them against fire among other things. ?Within a 
month,  having smoked his entire stockpile of cigars and without having made 
even  his first premium payment on the policy, the man filed a claim against 
the  insurance company. ?In his claim, the man stated the cigars were lost 
"in  
a series of small fires." The insurance company refused to pay, citing the  
obvious reason that the man had consumed the cigars in the normal fashion.  ? 
The man sued.... ?and won. 
In delivering the ruling the  judge agreeing that the claim was frivolous, 
stated nevertheless that the  man held a policy from the company in which it 
had warranted that the cigars  were insurable and also guaranteed that it 
would insure against fire,  without defining what it considered to be 
"unacceptable fire," and was  obligated to pay the claim. ?Rather than endure 
a lengthy and costly  appeal process the insurance company accepted the 
ruling 
and paid the man  $15,000 for the rare cigars he lost in "the fires." After 
the man cashed the  check, however, the company had him arrested on 24 counts 
of arson.  ?With his own insurance claim and testimony from the previous 
case  
being used against him, the man was convicted of intentionally burning his  
insured property and sentenced to 24 months in jail and a $24,000 fine.

John,

A couple of items - would you mind updating the curves for me so I have the 
most current info before we begin talking with Chase.  Also, I just wanted to 
follow-up on the status of our open items:
Pushkar is on-board and waiting for a contact from Fleet
Credit will still have to be addressed for Stoneville
The margin agreement between Stoneville and ENA will include broad 
rehypothecation procedures

What is the status of (1) accounting, (2) nymex risk books, and (3) basis & 
index books (dummy trade tickets)?  Let me know when you will have a chance 
to look through the model.  Thanks again for all your help.

Mike

Thanks for the information - we now understand how their deal is priced. The 
only rate I am unable to verify is the max int. Permian - Hueco rate of 
$.15819. The El Paso tariff shows $.1936, exclusive of surcharges (GRI and

from Cementos Chihuahua, they have facilities y the Ciudad Chihuahua region,

I just heard from Scott, and this second VPP has just closed.  Please write 
up the physical deal tics regarding this add-on piece.  Remember, you will 
not be receiving these second VPP vols physically until March.  When you get 
a chance, please send me the deal tic - EB 3339F.  I will make sure people in 
my area receive a copy.  When we receive the executed docs, I will make you a 
copy.

John,


For a down and out put, I put the following as an approximation for our 
understanding purpose.

a down and out put with barrier B < strike K
is overestimated by

A put at struck at K - a put struck at B - (K-B)*digital put strike at B.

I ploted the barrier put (blue line)  versus the approximation (red line) as 
function of the 
barrier.  

The true barrier option has zero payoff whenever there is a touch down the 
barrier
during the lifetime of the option.  Therefore it goes to zero much faster than
above approximation when B -> K.

See the spreadsheet for more details.

Dave,

To follow up on our conversation about the Pipe Option Book, Errol will 
provide post id's for Friday's COB
to calc the pipe options book with the skew table. As I asked on the phone 
please provide two calcs, one calc
for the pipe options deals with and with out skew and another calc with the 
NYMEX options deals with and without skew.

In addition to this, please recalc  1078960 & 1078963 for the ngpropt book.  
These calcs are for puts and for calls for COB 3-23.

If you have any questions please contact me at 3-9257 with any questions

Pursuant to our discussions this morning, attached is John Griffith's file 
regarding the changes in extrinsic value for each of the transport books.  As 
we discussed, each of you should make a determination as to what changes in 
correlation you should make to offset the decreases in value due to the 
change in the model.  Since you have been using the correlation factor to 
adjust the values to reflect market, a simple change decreasing these 
correlations will offset the change in value due to John's "fix".  This 
change simply makes the transport model one step closer to properly 
reflecting the intra- and inter-month optionality values--Research did review 
the change and agrees that it is appropriate.  If you have any questions, 
please call me at x35514.

John, thanks for your help with this!

Greg, please coordinate with the traders when you expect to make this change 
official in the books so that they can change their correlations accordingly.

The structure is critical. I don't want to cash out the entire fixed price 
position and then turn around and sell them index gas at $8.  Then I have a 
huge receivable risk that has no MTM offset.  I'd rather reset the fixed 
price to somwhere in between, especially if they are hurting for cash.

I'm unclear, but evidently we sold $2 dollar gas to them (back in 1996) and 
they are asking to cash out...I think we end up paying them roughly 20 
million dollars.  I'll give you better/more details as I learn them.

John,
Thanks for stopping by.  For pre-paids and the like we have an expediated 
DASH process.  Since the counterparty is National Steel, we will need to get 
credit involved.  I've included Chip on this email regarding costs of funds.  

The expediated DASH process is for financings of embedded in commodity 
transactions.  This is to ensure that these type of transactions are reviewed 
considering funds flow and the ability to syndicate, as well as credit, 
documentation, and pricing.  This process is intended to be less 
comprehensive than a standard DASH and is to be used only for embedded 
financing transactions that are either (i) short- term or (ii) longer-term if 
with relatively highly-rated counterparties.


Thanks,

Frank

naming Southern Company Services as Agent). I could not find any specific

Attached is the vol. skew that was used for the current day (April 10) calc;
the prior day (April 9) calc. still used the one you loaded on Mar. 30. 

i.e., the official post_id 1101853 used the April 10 vol. skew for current 
day but the Mar. 30 vol. skew for the prior day valuations.

MAY DAY ... a holiday?   or a (bond-market) plea for help?

Relative Value:
1. TYM1 / TYU1 still somewhat undervalued
2. TYM1 also relatively cheap compared to deliverable securities
3. UST:   (a) 6 to 10 month TEDs very cheap
(b) current 5yr somewhat rich vs Libor
(c) 2yr roll is somewhat undervalued
4. GSE:   (a) 2yr to 3yr Benchmark / Reference Notes likely to
underperform both Libor and other GSE over near term
(b) '05 paper relatively cheap vs Libor and otehr GSE paper
(c) issues under 14 mos trading cheap (funding adjusted)

Comments:

open too cheap,  (b) 10yrs - reopening
2. If data from Housing & (recent) auto production are "right" vs
confidence reports ... then FedFunds Futures are probably overvalued

Phil,

Attached is a very crude spreadsheet to calculate the hedge ratio needed to 
hedge your power short in SERC.  The calculations that I am using is written 
up in an article that is at research's website in their technical corner.  
Call me and I will direct you to the article.  Also call with any questions 
or concerns. 

Have you talked to your VAR people?  Where do you stand with this?  

I look forward to hearing from you.  Thanks.

John

We have arranged for John Griffith to go to Chihuahua with you. I have given 
him the El Paso rate information (there are conflicts with your spreadsheet) 
and provided the big picture overview.  I advised Agustin that there is still 
no capacity available on El Paso, therefore, we may need to purchase gas from 
an existing shipper to make this work (Burlington?)

Please let me know if  you have any questions - I am in PRC meetings on 
Monday.

Regards,

Stephanie

ECT Merchant Investments Corp. has entered into a Volumetric Production 
Payment agreement with St. Mary's Production LLC (Preston) which provides for 
the dedication of St. Mary's non-operated gas production from the Hunt Oil 
Company operated Myette Point Northwest Field. The VPP has both a firm and 
swing volume component. We will move both packages of gas through the  Enron 
North America Upstream Wellhead Desk to manage the sale, nomination and 
transport of this production. I negotiated a contract between ENA and ECT 
Merchant Investments Corp. whereby we will manage the firm and swing portions 
of this transaction through our wellhead desk. The negotiated contract has 
financial  keep whole language for the firm portion of this transaction and 
George will be able to manage the swing volumes. 

We will be receiving the volumes at the Texas Gas meters rather than the 
wellhead. Preston is required to transport this gas to the Texas Gas meters 
by moving the gas across the producer owned gathering system and Preston will 
be assuming those gathering fees. The volumes are currently split 50-50 
between Texas Gas metes 9437 and 9502.  Based on our information, we actually 
expect 87% of the volume at meter 9437 and 13% of the volume at meter 9502. 
With respect to the ECT Merchant Investments Corp. and the ENA contract and 
the St. Mary's Production, LLC and ENA contract ("Preston" deal), George 
Weissman and Melissa Graves will assume responsibility for having our records 
and deals properly updated.  They will also work closely with Eric Wardle, 
ECT Merchant Investments Corp. to assure the firm volumes are managed daily 
and any keep whole requirements are managed properly. 

Robert Cook has reviewed the reserves with Craig Fox and, in addition to a 
third party reserve study, will finalize his study later this week to 
determine if any additional volumes are available for further mark-to-market 
valuation.

The following is a summary of the transaction:

 1. Term commencing 1/1/2001 and ending 6/30/2003

 2. Firm purchase for 90% of the wellhead volume, starting at 90% of 11,567 
per day and declining as defined by the VPP volumes

 3. Gas daily purchase for the remaining 10% of the wellhead volume

 4. The transaction between ENA and ECT Merchant Investments will keep Enron 
Upstream whole should volumes for the 90% firm component fail to show       
up on any given day of term of the transaction.
 
 5. Pricing to customer Texas Gas SL Index plus 0.0025 

 6. Volumes for Phase 1 Preston ,including both firm and swing, total 
approximately 15,000 MMBTU/d

 7. Volumes for Phase 2 Preston ,including both firm and swing, will increase 
by 8,000 MMBTU/d 

 8. Total February 2001 Preston volumes from the 8 wells will be 
approximately 23,000 MMBTU/d

 An additional note regarding this transaction. Preston has been a 
non-operator and therefor they have not been marketing their gas. They have 
allowed Hunt to market under the JOA and , as a result, Hunt has been paying 
Preston's royalties. Starting in January, under the arrangement we are 
putting in place with ATS, ATS will be paying the royalties for Preston for 
the term of this transaction.

Should you wish to discuss this transaction further, please advise.

Notice # 01-154
May 7, 2001

TO:
All NYMEX Division Members and Member Firms

FROM:
Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President

RE:
Implementation of New NYMEX Rule 9.11A ("Give-Up Trades")

DATE:
May 7, 2001
===========================================================
Please be advised that beginning on the trade date of Friday, June 1, 2001,
new NYMEX Rule 9.11A ("Give-Up Trades") will go into effect.

!    In the absence of an applicable give-up agreement, new Rule 9.11A will
define the respective responsibilities/obligations to an order of executing
brokers, customers and Clearing Members.

!    The term "executing broker" as used in Rule 9.11A refers to the
registered billing entity, Member Firm or Floor Broker to whom the order is
transmitted.

!    Rule 9.11 will provide that, in the absence of an applicable give-up
agreement, a Clearing Member may reject a trade only if: (1) the trade
exceeds trading limits established by the Clearing Member for that customer
that have been communicated to the executing broker as provided by the rule
or (2) the trade is an error for which the executing broker is responsible.

!    The new rule also places affirmative obligations on executing brokers
to confirm Clearing Member authorization for an account.  For example,
prior to an executing broker accepting and executing an initial order for
any new customer account, such executing broker must confirm with the
Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that:
(a)  the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member;
(b)  the account number;
(c)  the brokerage rate;
(d)  the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with
the executing broker for that account; and
(e)  a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that
account.
Moreover, the executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or
the specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite
party, date, time, and any other relevant information.  The Compliance
Department will conduct periodic audits of such records, and falsification
of such information shall be the basis for disciplinary action.


If you have any questions concerning this new rule, please contact Bernard
Purta, Senior Vice President, Regulatory Affairs and Operations, at (212)
299- 2380; Thomas LaSala, Vice President, NYMEX Compliance Department, at
(212) 299-2897; or Arthur McCoy, Vice President, Financial Surveillance
Section, NYMEX Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2928,

NEW RULE 9.11A ("Give-Up Trades")

(Entire rule is new.)

Rule 9.11A     Give-Up Trades

In the absence of a give-up agreement whose terms and conditions govern the
responsibilities/obligations of executing brokers, customers and Clearing
Members, the following rules shall define the respective
responsibilities/obligations of those parties to an order.  The "executing
broker", as used in this rule, is the registered billing entity, Member
Firm or Floor Broker to whom the order is transmitted.

(A)    Responsibilities/Obligations of Clearing Members

(1). Limits Placed by Clearing Member.   A Clearing Member may, in its
discretion, place trading limits on the trades it will accept for give-up
for a customer's account from an executing broker, provided however, that
the executing broker receives prior written or electronic notice from the
Clearing Member of the trading limits on that account.  Notice must be
received by the executing broker in a timely manner.  A copy of such notice
shall be retained by the Clearing Member.

(2). Trade Rejection.  A Clearing Member may reject ("DK") a trade only if:
(1) the trade exceeds the trading limits established under Section I(A) of
this rule for that customer and it has been communicated to the executing
broker as described in Subsection (A); or (2) the trade is an error for
which the executing broker is responsible.  If a Clearing Member has a
basis for rejecting a trade, and chooses to do so in accordance with the
provisions of Rule 2.21(B), it must notify the executing broker promptly.

(3). Billing.  A Clearing Member will pay all floor brokerage fees incurred
for all transactions executed by the executing broker for the customer and
subsequently accepted by the Clearing Member by means of the ATOM system.
Floor brokerage fees will be agreed upon in advance among the Clearing
Member, customer and the executing broker.

(B)  Responsibilities/Obligations of Executing Brokers

(1)  Customer Order Placement.  An executing broker will be responsible for
determining that all orders are placed or authorized by the customer.  Once
an order has been accepted, a broker or the broker's clerk must:

(a)  confirm the terms of the order with the customer;
(b)  accurately execute the order according to its terms;
(c)  confirm the execution of the order to the customer as soon as
practicable; and
(d)  transmit such executed order to the Clearing Member as soon as
practicable in accordance with Exchange Rules and procedures.

2.   Use of Other Persons.  Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the
executing broker is allowed to use the services of another broker in
connection with the broker's obligations under these rules.  The executing
broker remains responsible to the customer and Clearing Member under these
rules.

3.    Executing Broker Responsibility for Verifying Clearing Member
Authorization.  Prior to a broker accepting and executing an initial order
for any new customer account, the executing broker must confirm with the
Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that:
(f)  the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member;
(g)  the account number;
(h)  the brokerage rate;
(i)  the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with
the executing broker for that account; and
(j)  a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that
account.
The executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or the
specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite party,
date, time, and any other relevant information.  The falsification of such
information shall be the basis for disciplinary action.

4.   Rejection of Customer Order.  Where an executing broker has confirmed
Clearing Member authorization to execute orders on behalf of a customer in
accordance with this Rule 9.11A, the broker may, in the broker's
discretion, reject an order that the customer transmits to the broker for
execution.  The broker shall promptly notify the customer and the Clearing
Member(s) of any such rejection.

the financial hedge related to the Brazos VPP's should be handled through 
Fred's group.  We need to make sure that the volume that is given to Fred (or 
Vikas or Ross) is only 97% of the VPP firm volumes.   Please let myself or 
Eric Moon know just as soon as you go to Fred's group for a quote so that we 
may be prepared for the physical side of the deal.

Fred, Vikas and Ross:  If you go to John Arnold and the basis trader for the 
quote, we need to let them know that this relates to the Brazos VPP's and 
that his quote is going to be known by Bank of America.  If executed, Bank of 
America will know that Enron is long and the exact volume and term.  They 
will be taking 3% of the deal at our quote (for accounting reasons, 3% of the 
hedge on these transactions has to be executed with a counterparty other than 
Enron, that counterparty is Bank of America).  Vikas and Ross, would you guys 
also call when these go through just a check.

Please call with any questions or concerns.  Thanks

John Griffith

Dutch,
As of this morning, Jeremy has noticed that the daily change and Vega is kind 
of a bit too much with the vol skew
and identified that there was an error in my code for passing the prior day 
MidPr, which caused errors in
the Prior day value and daily change numbers. Now the code is fixed.
I run a few new post_id, and the changes look much smooth.
For March 27 run:
NGPROpt book 1084746 copied into 1086213(with skew)
calls 1085788 and 1086211(with skew)
puts 1085015 and 1086212(with skew)
done with Jeremy's excutible of port_calc on stage.

Dave,

To follow up on our conversation about the Pipe Option Book, Errol will 
provide post id's for Friday's COB
to calc the pipe options book with the skew table. As I asked on the phone 
please provide two calcs, one calc
for the pipe options deals with and with out skew and another calc with the 
NYMEX options deals with and without skew.

In addition to this, please recalc  1078960 & 1078963 for the ngpropt book.  
These calcs are for puts and for calls for COB 3-23.

If you have any questions please contact me at 3-9257 with any questions

Hey, I made this silly animation after seeing performance art/music/dance
troupe Fischerspooner last Sat, but I didn't have my camera. Mr. Hughes was
kind enough to host it on his site in a secret place. So the only way you
can see it is to click this link:

http://members.nbci.com/_XMCM/jodyhughes/Als.folder/FischerspoonerbyAlHerrmann

It takes a few minutes to download, but I think it's worth it.

**Clarification**

Harassment Prevention Training

This training is mandatory for all Enron employees employed since the last 
seminar was conducted  in late 1998 or early 1999.  Those who have already 
attended Enron harassment avoidance training will be offered a refresher 
course in avoiding and preventing harassment.

To contribute our personal best at ENRON, our conduct must promote respectful

ENRON's vision and values and violates Company policy.  Harassment also can 
violate federal and state laws.  By understanding what harassment is and its 
potential harm, we can prevent it in our workplace.

During this training you will:

 Be able to recognize harassment
 Learn to take precautions against being harassed
 Learn to avoid being considered a harasser
 Know how to address a situation involving harassment
 Learn how harassment prevention is consistent with ENRON values

Please click here (  )  to sign up for the session of your choice.    If you 
have problems registering or have any questions, please call 713 853-0357.

We are pleased to announce that all employees of EWS and EES will receive 
harassment prevention training.  

The dates and times available for the sessions are:


 Friday, Feb 23; 1:00 - 2:30; 2:45 - 4:15
  Monday Mar 5; 1:00 - 2:30; 2:45 - 4:15; 4:30 - 6:00

All training sessions will be held in the LaSalle Room at the DoubleTree 
Hotel.
There is a $50 charge for each attendee in the training session.

John,
In regard to our previous discussions regarding the floating tariff and 
related swap for the offshore floating production system financing, we are 
now in the Phase II bidding process for Devil's Tower.  Attached is the 
production profile for Devil's Tower.  

Can you run your analysis on the 1P volumes (guaranteed, firm volumes) and 
advise us of your findings [floating oil and gas tariffs].  I am available to 
meet with you today at 2 p.m., 4 p.m. or anytime tomorrow (Friday).  Let me 
know what your schedule is like.

Thanks, Lisa Druzbik

On your workstation, shut CQG down...
Find the Hard Drive Letter where CQG was installed such as C or D...
Go there using either My Computer or Explorer...
Find the CQG Folder and open it up...
Find the 5x265 folder and open it up...
Find the Private folder...
Within the Private folder are several sub folders (Log, Page and Temp)...
Delete the Temp folder by RIGHT Clicking on it and then LEFT Clicking on
Delete.
Restart CQG and you should be able to see the prices you've been missing.

Regarding the 5x265 update to 5x270 messages:  This is due to our running
different Client(5x265)  and Server(5x270) versions at Enron at this time.
I have already submitted a fix for this and it will be taken care of as soon
as the Enron Servers are restarted - which will be done tonight I hope.
We will be upgrading both Server and Client versions within the next couple
of weeks.

Please contact me if you have any questions or if there's anything else I
can do, etc...  Thanks.

Mike and Frank,

Attached is a revised quote for options relating to the ACE deal.  The 
changes include actual Daily MW Production from Gray and also a hedge ratio 
of 10.522 mmbtu's/MW.  I calculated the hedge ratio 2 ways.  First I put the 
SRAC formula in excel (tying to the Aug'00 SRAC calculation from SoCal 
Edison) and I increased the price of natural gas by $1 and noted the 
difference in the SRAC power price.  That resulted in an increase in the SRAC 
of $1.0522 cents/kwh or converted to $10.522/mwh.  I also looked at a change 
in mark-to-market profit based on a hedge of 10.522 mmbtu's for every 1 MW.  
So for every 1 mwh you need to hedge 10.522 mmbtu's.  Next I took the SRAC 
formula below:

     Pn = {PBase + (PBase * (GPn - GPBase)/GPBase * Factor)} * TOU

    Where   Pn = SRAC price
     PBase = Base Enery Price $2.0808 cents/kwh (constant)
     GPn = current Socal index
     GPBase = Base Gas Price $1.3975/mmbtu (constant)
     Factor = % change in enery price affected by gas price .7067 (constant)
     TOU = time of use (i.e. Summer on peak = 1.4251)

If you look at just the piece that moves (GPn) and calculate a $1 
increase:    ($2.0808 * ($1 - $1.375)/$1.375 * .7067) = 1.0522. 

Gray had calculated the heat rate by taking the SRAC price divided by the gas 
price.  This heat rate moves depending on the level of gas (decreases with an 
increase in gas price).  This is a correct  calculation for the heat rate, 
however, to calculate the hedge delta, the above calculation should be used 
and this hedge delta stays constant no matter the level of gas price.

Please call with any questions or concerns.  My number is (713) 853-6247.  
Thanks.

John

Subject: LNG TRANSACTION AROUND THE ELBA ISLAND LNG TERMINAL

ERIC:

We had a brief discussion regarding the LNG sales arrangement Enron has 
entered with El Paso Merchant Energy (successor to Sonat Energy Services) 
centered on the firm service capacity that Merchant holds at the Elba Island 
LNG Terminal, which will be reactivated to accept LNG tanker deliveries 
sometime late next year or early in 2002.

Enron signed a binding Letter Agreement (which included a fairly 
comprehensive Term Sheet) with Merchant on October 13, 1999.  A copy of this 
agreement is attached hereto.




It was anticipated that the parties would execute a "Definitive Agreement", 
which would replace the Letter Agreement and contain a number of other terms 
and conditions to be mutually agreed upon.  As a precaution, the Letter 
Agreement did outline a process to bring closure to this matter in case the 
parties could not agree.

The parties did work together for several months on negotiating an "LNG Sale 
and Purchase Agreement", which added a considerable number of important 
provisions and modified a number of terms and conditions contained in the 
Letter Agreement for the benefit of both parties.  However, the Quality 
Letter Agreement, which is an attachment to the Letter Agreement, has become 
a major source of contention for two primary reasons:
despite the fact that the parties did not intend to modify the Quality Letter 
Agreement, it is apparent to Enron, and indeed to Merchant, that this 
agreement does not position the Terminal with the capability of handling LNG 
from any meaningful number of LNG production sources in the world.
Southern LNG, which is a party to the Quality Letter Agreement, has no 
intention of agreeing to meaningfully modify its Terminal, although something 
could be worked out if Enron were to eliminate a considerable portion of its 
flexibility and optionality in its sales arrangement with Merchant, an 
affiliate of Southern LNG.

I am attaching a copy of the LNG Sale and Purchase Agreement, as it was last 
drafted in early July this year.  This draft does represent some considerable 
movement from the Letter Agreement, but we found it to be acceptable with the 
assumption that the quality issue would be favorably resolved.  This copy is 
in the comparewrite format, but I think you will be able to work your way 
through it for your purposes.




When it recently became apparent that w would not be able to close with 
Merchant in terms acceptable to use, we decided we had better move back to 
the Term Sheet intent, even though both parties will realize some 
unattractive returns.  We have now drafted up the "Definitive LNG Sale and 
Purchase Agreement', which we believe captures the full intent of the Letter 
Agreement and Term Sheet.  It is attached below for your review.




Following your review of the pertinent aspects of these last two documents, 
we would appreciate the opportunity to meet with you to discuss how, from a 
pricing point of view, they might be better restructured.


Regards.
Les

Dave/Jeff,

I spoke with Jason Williams (Enron Credit) and he confirmed there will be no 
credit reserve on the new index deal.  He is verifying that there is no need 
to "e-dash" the deal.  I will get back to you as soon as I hear word.  If one 
is required, we will help get the document pushed through the system.

The next step, if you and the City of Mesa are ready, is to get a firm quote 
from Mike Grigsby this afternoon.

Let me know.

Regards,

Eric


PS - Attached is an e-dash.  If one is needed, you will need to complete the 
first section describing the deal.  As you can tell by the matrix, it does 
not appear an e-dash is necessary because the City of Mesa has a AA- rating 
and the transaction is approx $8 million and less than 1 year.

Item Description :
NO RESERVE! This RARE , OUT-OF-PRINT , DELETED and HARD-TO-FIND 1990 Original 
CD (NOT a cd-r) by REVENGE (Revenge : Bassist Peter Hook of New Order and 
Monaco - best known for their hit " What Do You Want From Me ? " from their 
CD " Music For Pleaseure .") album CD titled ONE TRUE PASSION (New Order has 
been one of the most successful British musical imports since "Blue Monday" 
stormed American dancefloors in 1983. After a series of successful albums 
such as Low-life (1985), Brotherhood (1986), and Technique (1989), the band 
took an extended hiatus in the early '90s, with each member pursuing solo 
projects. Vocalist Bernard Sumner teamed up with the Smiths' Johnny Marr to 
form Electronic, Gillian Gilbert and Stephen Morris recorded under the 
moniker the Other Two, and bassist Peter Hook released One True Passion in 
1990 as a member of Revenge.
Each of the New Order side projects took a decidedly different route. 
Sumner's Electronic was essentially a variation of New Order's catchy blend 
of dance and rock, while Morris and Gilbert's the Other Two came across like 
a lighter version of Everything but the Girl. Revenge incorporated elements 
of industrial into what was basically New Order's signature sound. 
Unfortunately, the result was less than satisfying, not due to the harsher 
tone, but for the lack of melody. Bearing ridiculous titles like "Surf Nazi" 
and "Fag Hag," the material on One True Passion is ultimately suffocated by 
bombastic arrangements. While Hook's vocals are remarkably similar to 
Sumner's, Revenge shows no trace of the ingenious instrumentation and 
engaging melodies that helped make New Order (along with Depeche Mode and the 
Cure) one of the most endearing British imports of the 1980s. Even the two 
best cuts on the album, "Pineapple Face" and "Slave," sound forced and 
over-arranged. Hook's distincti!
ve!
bass playing is also noticeably missing, replaced by an overabundance of 
synthesizers.) is in Excellent Playable Condition with awesome pictures

In ERMS there is a screen (option_gd) that I go to that I see all of our 
option positions by strike (I can toggle between Exchange/OTC/Swaption and 
Put/Call).  This is run by a post id (1051038).  If I pull this post id into 
an options detail excel spreadsheet, it gives me all of our options but not 
summed by strike.  I would like to be able to pull our option positions into 
excel summed by strike (with the same toggles I have on the screen).  With 
this information, I can run some slides of my delta, gamma, vega, theta 
etc... in excel with the current market.  What do I need to do in order to 
get this information?  

Thank you for you time and prompt attention to this matter.

I think Zimin has been hanging around the "phull volume" guy to much.  I 
think what he is trying to say is that you are calculating the historical vol 
correctly but to compare this (historical vol) to an implied vol from either 
the marketplace or as calculated by yourself, there will be an underlying 
assumption of a calendar year as the basis for option maturity. Therefore you 
would have to use the sqrt of 365.25 in order to make a comparison to the 
historical vol.

You always said that we would end up working together at some stage...

Actually I've just logged into the mail system here in London were I'm 
currently working on a project with Enron Metals Trading, still employed by 
Cap Gemini Ernst & Young though. What's Houston like? Hot as usual I guess 
and Enron keeps you busy, or? I've been doing a fair bit of travelling around 
Europe lately so London actually feels just like a short distance and a nice 
place to be since everybody speaks english and working with Enron is a 
challangening task. This is going to be an interesting project.

Back home life goes on and I got married last october. We really enjoy our 
house and in that sence it's a pity to be away so much, but you can't have it 
all, can you :-)

Got to go! Cheers!

John,
Attached is the base curve we used to value the ACE (Ahlstrom plant in CA) as 
of Nov 10,2000.  

What I am looking for is this:

What would be the cost to buy the following four put options,
assuming financial settle 
 volume of 10,000 MMBtu/day ,
settled at Socal,
Option term of 2001-2002 :

Monthly Put option, strike price based on the curve in the attached 
spreadsheet (Nov 10 curve)
Same as above but strike is at the market.
Annual put option, strike price based on the curve in the attached 
spreadsheet (Nov 10 curve).
Annual put option but with strike at the market.

Last week I got bids from Phillips which were ($0.02) and ($0.03) for Socal 
basis for 2001 and 2002, respectively.  We will likely need to update these 
numbers.

John,

I need a list of names of everyone who will be using Vol Smile.  I will need 
the names and the priveleges for each person.  The privelege can either be 
read or read and write.  I have already set the spreadsheet for this 
authorization check.  The table is set up in test right now.  Prior to moving 
it to production, I'll  need the names and priveleges from you.  I will let 
you know as soon as Vol Smile authorization is complete.  Thanks.

Hey John & Angie, Have you heard the news from K-Girl?  Probably, but I'm
going to tell you anyway.  We're going to have a wedding July 28th.  K-Girl &
B-Boy will get married in Midland at Centennial Plaza(the most beautiful
water garden) in the AM.  We're pretty excited about the whole thing.
Keran's words to you are, you would make it very special if you
Angie(especially you Angie) & John(of course you John) could be there. It's
going to be a beautiful affair, no problems(everyoune must leave problems at
home or not come) that's the rules.  Southwest is running a special and I
would fly you two out for the day or for however long you wanted to stay.
Check your calendar and if you can it will be WONDERFUL but remember if you
can't we certainly understand and will just have to have another one in
Houston just for you two.
Love you so much!!!!
Mel

Well, yep, I am still alive, I still exist here in LA. This hasn't been
easy, it's not easy, but it hasn't killed me, just given me a recurring
chest cold. It seems that it's only really hard to breathe on the days when
I have something pretty big and pressing to do, like the day before actually
getting the truck, or today when I had to go to Aquent to get tested on my
computer skills, and then wanted to go apply for jobs at 12 different
photo-related businesses (which I didn't do). But on the days that I allow
myself to have fun, it is great.

Last week on Monday I went to Point Dume beach w/ Mark Allen and his friend
Elyse, and we had a great time. Of course the water and the day were way too
cold to go swimming, but we hiked up a cliff overhanging the water, where
surfers were trying to catch the 9-15 foot waves. I got pictures of them,
and photo'd Mark and Elyse walking through the crazy daisies that grow
bushlike out of the top of 2.5' sticks in the sand. Then on Sat., I went
hiking by myself in Griffith Park, which is literally up the street from our
house. Griffith Park is a big park in the Hollywood Hills, maybe (I'm not
sure) where the Hollywood sign is. Sort of a California version of Central
Park, with mountains and a whole lot more wild. (From our apartment, we can
see the "lly" and "d" of the Hollywood sign, mostly obscured by palm trees.)
So I was walking along this dirt fire road, amazed at the solitude and
immensity of the nature, my head being buzzed by an annoyed bee or
something, when I turned a corner and saw a huge chunk of LA in front of me.
I'm still too new here to be able to know exactly what I was looking at, but
way in the distance I could see jets taking off from LAX, I think. Closer
was Hollywood, where I live. There were some tall buildings that I think
were the Melrose area, and way in the distance, I could see these buildings
that were backlit from the light reflecting off the ocean. The Ocean. The
Pacific. I could see the PACIFIC from the MOUNTAINS by my house. It is
amazing. Okay, maybe they're technically hills, since I could walk up them
following the trails, but they are definitely mountains to me. Besides, you
can practically walk up Everest, w/ oxygen.
We've gone to art openings, had fun there, gone to parties, had fun there,
too. Can't find really good, really cheap beer here like Pearl, yet, but
I'll keep trying. The Food for Less has a twenty-pack of Budweiser for
$9.98, just 50? a beer. Went to two music shows this last week, at two
different places, and was able to bring my camera in, no problem.
I still haven't processed any film here yet, still way too broke to do it.
I've got about 18 or 19 rolls shot so far, some of it from before I left
Houston. I'll probably process the film even though I "can't afford it", cuz
I'm thinking I might be able to use some of the photos in my portfolio,
which I can use to make me some big money. Gotta spend money to make it,
gotta believe it's worth it, cuz it is. It's easy to believe in my head,
but's harder to get off the couch. I'm still trying to get the guts to go
through all my photos and put together my portfolio. I was out today, had
just filled out a simple application at a camera store (my first), when I
realized I was carrying around my graphics portfolio, and none of my photos.
So I bought some ice cream and came home.
I miss you guys. Tell me how you are. Write to me, email me, call me.
Instant message me, even. Jody is not enough for me, I need other friends.
Remember that I'm two hours behind you, and I stay up really late, so you
can call me at 4am there and I'm still not even home from the bar yet. I
expect every single one of you to move out here one day. Don't forget about
me when I make it big.

John, just to continue "chipping away"  this deal... Regarding The Juarez 
LDC, I talked already to Juarez LDC an their answers were the following:
1.- Regarding 3 year historical gas consumption data,,,They will send it in 
the next couple of days. 
2.- Regarding the flow of gas through their interconnection to 
Southern,,,They say that the only gas that flows through that interonnection 
is for the Juarez USe, and there is little capacoity left on that 
interconnection.  All the gas flowing to Chihuahua and Samalayuca is through 
the new Gaseoductos  de Chihuahua pipeline. 
3.- Gas Natural de Juarez, does not have any capacity in the U.S. side of the 
border.  They have not gone out there to look for capacity and have not asked 
for capacity to Southern, yet.

Kind regards.

Mary Lynne,

Just wanted to updated you on the current prepay that is scheduled to close 
next thursday (28th) with Chase and Fleet.  The prepay is anticipated as 
follows:

Total Funds      $330,000,000
Financing Expenses:
 Upfront to Banks $2,582,500
 Surety Bonds  $2,175,670
  Total Fees         $4,758,170

Anticipated Cash Flow    $325,241,830

The anticipated reserve related to ENE cost of funds versus the prepay is  
estimated to be ($130,501) while the timing differential between delivery 
date and settlement date (55 days) is estimated to be ($2,949,879).  Please 
let me know if you have any questions or need any additional information.  
Thanks again for your help.

Michael

Internal approval schedules at both Enron and El Paso dictate a delay in 
signing until Tuesday morning 5-Dec.

Attached are the latest drafts of all of the significant documents regarding 
the transaction.  There are two minor commercial issues - one regarding the 
final arithmetic for the deferred payment schedule and the other in regard to 
the Merlin SubNote participation.  There are some final tweaks to come to the 
numbers and language in the tax sections of the Transaction and LLC 
Agreements.  Most other changes are anticipated to be minimal from this point 
forward.  

I will be out tomorrow, but will be checking voice mail.  Please leave me a 
voice mail or call Lisa Mellencamp with any final issues you may have.  

Thank you for your prompt attention to these matters.

Hey big brother, how are things going?  Happy New Year and a belated Merry
Christmas to everyone.  I hope that everything is going okay.  I am sorry
that I did not make it to your house for Christmas.  I am very bad about
procrastination and I wait to the last minute on everything.  I do miss you
guys and we will come to stay with you soon.  I hope that you can forgive
me.  I am really sorry.  I love you very much.  We just stayed here and had
a very quite Christmas and New Years.  I did see Mel and Keran.  They
seemed to be okay.  Angie and I drove to Keran's house on Christmas nite.
Everything just happened to quick.  We were not prepared time wise and
financial wise to leave town for Christmas.  How was it?  I guess you had
really bad weather.  Lots of ice and snow?  How is business?  I have been
really busy here.  I didn't take any time off during the holidays.  Being
the new person in the group, I couldn't.  It was really busy.

I love you guys very much and I better get back to work.  I will try to
call you tomorrow afternoon.  Tell everyone hi.

Love you

Dutch,
As of this morning, Jeremy has noticed that the daily change and Vega is kind 
of a bit too much with the vol skew
and identified that there was an error in my code for passing the prior day 
MidPr, which caused errors in
the Prior day value and daily change numbers. Now the code is fixed.
I run a few new post_id, and the changes look much smooth.
For March 27 run:
NGPROpt book 1084746 copied into 1086213(with skew)
calls 1085788 and 1086211(with skew)
puts 1085015 and 1086212(with skew)

Dave,

To follow up on our conversation about the Pipe Option Book, Errol will 
provide post id's for Friday's COB
to calc the pipe options book with the skew table. As I asked on the phone 
please provide two calcs, one calc
for the pipe options deals with and with out skew and another calc with the 
NYMEX options deals with and without skew.

In addition to this, please recalc  1078960 & 1078963 for the ngpropt book.  
These calcs are for puts and for calls for COB 3-23.

If you have any questions please contact me at 3-9257 with any questions

Marilyn,

In talking to Amber, she said that you could set-up entities that  are 
affiliated with Enron.  Enron is the GP of Brazos VVP Limited Partnership and 
we need to set-up as  a counter party on the system to assign some trades.   
It is my understanding that RAC (Credit) has approved Brazos.  Let me know if 
you have any questions. Thx  JGM

Congratulations to the ECP team - we signed the Transaction Agreement 
yesterday afternoon!  Thanks to everyone for their concerted efforts in 
bringing this transaction to this important milestone.


Financial close of the sale is dependent upon several factors - the most 
important of which are:

1.  Rating Agency reaffirmation of the rating on ECP's Senior Notes - both 
Moody's and S&P have indicated that they will announce reaffirmation upon our 
notification to them of the closing of the sale.

2.  ISRA certificate of non-applicability - This is the New Jersey 
environmental condition which according to our NJ counsel, LeBeouf, "is on 
the last desk".

3.  Minority partner consent at Bayonne - EPG wishes to complete a buyout of 
the remaining two minority interests which ECP does not own rather than 
obtain an explicit consent to our transaction.  We completely concur with 
this approach and have granted EPG (a) an incentive if financial close occurs 
this year - $500k price reduction, and (b) an extension to 22-Jan-01 of the 
maximum time allowed for financial close.  Though negotiations with Calpine, 
the largest minority partner at Calpine, are well advanced, it is certainly 
more likely that financial close will occur in early January than next week.

4.  Transition Services Agreement - We need to finalize the terms of and the 
specific services to be provided by ENA to ECP on behalf of EPG during a 
short transition phase beginning with financial close.

>From time to time I will attempt to keep you informed of progress on these 
major items.  


Attached are two files summarizing:

(i) our estimate of 4Q00 P&L results assuming a sale of the SubNotes to 
Condor on 21-Dec and using an estimate of financial close on 27-Dec -   
"ECPmemotable_bka.xls" (Please note - If financial close is delayed until 
January the $500k incentive fee will not be paid to EPG and moving the 
valuation date from 27-Dec to 31-Dec will actually increase P&L for the 
quarter), and 

(ii) an update to the overall transaction results and monetization 
sensitivities - "epgofferanalysis (12-18-00)4Q.xls" (Please note -  the 
estimate of 1Q01 P&L is slightly negative for offering costs associated with 
monetizing the swaps; however, under current market conditions it is quite 
possible that we could realize a monetization rate better than the forecast 
rate of 8.50% and more than sufficient to offset these expenses in their 
entirety).  

Please call with any questions.  


Thanks again everyone.

While  markets  digest  the  impact of the ECB's surprising, but apparently
credibility  damaging  interest rate cut on both European asset markets and
the  euro,  the  Fed  will  rub salt into the wounds this week with another
aggressive  ease  in  policy. Although this may be the last ease this year,
recent  market  moves suggest that the Fed has done enough to support hopes
of  a  recovery  in  H2.  The ECB in contrast, by last week's price action,
still  has  some  way  to go, leaving EUR/USD vulnerable to new lows in the
very short term.

Attached are the clean and blackline versions of the final El Paso documents.

With respect to the Schedule to the Master Agreement, the clean version is 
attached, but there is no blackline version.  The only two changes were the 
removal of the draft date and the revision of the signature block for 
Mesquite.

Jeremy,

John and I really need to meet Tuesday for about 30min-1hr with you Dave and 
Sanjeev, so that we can better understand how the options are being calc'd in 
the system.  We thought we had a pretty good idea after talking on Friday, 
but tonight we see that we don't.  John is about one half million dollars off 
every night in his prediction of the P/L for Mike's book, and we're afraid 
our position might not be correct as well.

Please give me a call.

Thanks,

Errol, X5-8274

Subject: Vega Issue - Vol. Smile

John:

The reason for the large Vega numbers on the TopPage report, while there were 
no corresponding changes in the Volatility curves, is due to the change in 
the mid. price for the current day versus the prior day. The corresponding 
volatility skews that are added to the vols. for the 2 days is causing the 
large vega numbers.

For example, for deal number QV5087.2 (exp. date 01-Jan-2002):

  Current Day  Prior Day
Mid. Price 5.885   5.772
Strike Price 3.5   3.5
Mid - Strike 2.385   2.272
Vol.  0.555   0.555
Vol. Skew 0.03816   0.03635
Actual Vol. 0.59316   0.59135

Option value for prior day using current day's vol. =  7,616,935  
Option value for prior day using prior day's vol.     =  7,547,238 
Vega                =  69,697

Thank you,
Jeremy

Hello, Sweetness! Sorry I didn't get back to you right away. You guys should
come here! It is awesome! Jody, Eric Neibhur, and I drove up into the
mountains on Sunday and played in the snow. It was awesome. We got there in
less than an hour after stopping twice to look at the view. I tried to make
a snow angel, but it was more of an ice angel, really. Neither Jody nor Eric
had gloves, so they weren't too keen on making snowballs and throwing them
at me. Still, we had a great time.

Sat. we went to see this performance group Fischerspooner in sort of the
equivalent of the Rice Hotel while it was under construction. They wore
crazy costumes and danced around and sang over djed music. It was pretty
cool, especially since we snuck in the back door, even though it was free,
since we didn't have reservations. (I made an animation of it. I'm trying to
figure out how to put it online for y'all!) Then we went to Chinatown for
art openings, and that was really cool. Then we went to a renovated bowling
alley to see a secret show by Kim Deal, but she didn't play cuz supposedly
Kelly Deal got married that day. But there was an alright band w/ the most
Amazingly cute girl singer, so it all good.

So you guys have to come here! Come here! C'mere!

See yu on Fri at Jessica's opening at Lawndale, then on Sat at the wedding.
Yeah!!!!!

xoxoxox,
Al Herrmann

Notice # 01-156
May 9, 2001

TO:
All NYMEX Members and Member Firms

FROM:
Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President

RE:
NYMEX Post-Close Trading Session Rules

DATE:
May 8, 2001
===========================================================

This Notice advises Members and Member Firms of changes to the two
post-close session rules applicable to the NYMEX Division.

!    As a result of amendments to both rules, the post-close sessions
generally offered Monday-Thursday will be the same as the Friday sessions
with two exceptions.

!    Monday-Thursday. These sessions will start at 3:25 p.m. and will be
two minutes long.

!    Fridays. These sessions will start at 3:30 p.m. and will be five
minutes long.


End of Week Post-Close Trading Session (Rule 6.57A)

As a reminder and as a follow-up to a Notice distributed last week, please
be advised that beginning on Friday, May 11, 2001, a number of amendments
to NYMEX Rule 6.57A, the NYMEX End of Week post-close trading session rule,
will become effective. The new version of this rule is attached below.

For Friday post-close sessions (and for post-close sessions the day before
a mid-week Exchange holiday) the following changes will be in effect:

(1)  Eligible contract months will be expanded from the first four to the
first 12 consecutive listed contract months.

(2)  The sessions now will be 5 minutes in duration.

(3)  The trading range for these sessions will be expanded by adding the
following ticks above (below) the
daily high (low) for the applicable contract month (provided that this
expanded trading range does not violate the maximum permissible price
fluctuation limits then in effect):

Crude Oil      20 ticks
Heating Oil         50 ticks
Unleaded Gas        50 ticks
Natural Gas         50 ticks


Monday-Thursday Post-Close Trading Sessions (Rule 6.57)

In addition, please be advised that beginning on Monday, May 14, 2001, a
number of amendments to NYMEX Rule 6.57, the Exchange's post-close trading
session rule for days other than Fridays, will become effective.  The new
version of this rule is attached below.

(1)  Eligible contract months will be expanded from the first four to the
first 12 consecutive listed contract months.

(2)  The trading range for these sessions will be expanded by adding the
following ticks above (below) the
daily high (low) for the applicable contract month (provided that this
expanded trading range does not violate the maximum permissible price
fluctuation limits then in effect):

Crude Oil      20 ticks
Heating Oil         50 ticks
Unleaded Gas        50 ticks
Natural Gas         50 ticks

(3)  Customer participation will be expanded to the same extent as is
permitted for the End of Week Post Close Session. Please note that any
order submitted during the RTH session, including but not limited to
resting orders such as stop orders, limit orders and good until cancelled
(GTC) orders, will be deemed to have expired as of the end of RTH for
purposes of this Session.  Accordingly, in the event that a market
participant with such an expired order seeks to participate in the Session,
a new order must be submitted.

(4)  As a consequence of the expanded trading range and customer
participation, trades done during this period will be price reported on
PRS.

Finally, please be advised that, as a matter of practice, the Exchange does
not currently offer post-close trading sessions for Propane futures
contracts.

If you have any questions concerning these changes, please contact George
Henderson, Vice President, NYMEX Floor Department, at (212) 299-2071; Rob
Stasi, Manager of Trading Floor Systems, NYMEX Floor Department, at (212)
299-2067, or Brian Regan, Senior Associate General Counsel, at (212)
299-2207.

Exchange holiday falls on a Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday on the trading
day preceding such midweek Exchange holiday, there shall be no post-close

Session'') shall commence on the trading floor pursuant to this rule and
subsequent to the close.  Except as otherwise provided by the President or
the President's designee for a particular trade date, such End of Week
Session shall commence twenty (20) minutes after the close of trading in
all futures contracts and shall continue for a period of  five (5) minutes
in all energy and metals futures contracts, subject to the following
conditions:

twelve listed delivery months;

Heating Oil                   50 ticks

(C) During the End of Week Session, Floor Members, Floor Brokers and their
customers may participate in the same manner as trading occurring during
the regular RTH session, except that any order submitted during the RTH
session, including but not limited to resting orders such as stop orders,
limit orders and good until cancelled (GTC) orders, will be deemed to have
expired as of the end of RTH for purposes of this End of Week Session.
Accordingly, in the event that a market participant with such an expired
order seeks to participate in the End of Week Session, a new order must be
submitted.

(D) Prices for trades executed during the End of Week Session shall  be
reported on public ticker services;

(E) Current market prices and trades executed during the End of Week

On 12/21 Colleen sent out an email with a file showing $ changes to each 
transport leg (and possibly changes to delta, gamma, vega and rho).  This 
change is due to an error in the formula for blending volatilities and 
correlation.  Please plan to attend a meeting on 1/4/01 at 12:00 to discuss 
these changes.  I will have an updated version of the impact of these changes 
based on tonites close.   Please call at x.36247 if you cannot attend.  
Thanks.

Gentlemen,

We just delivered signed documents to EES on Project Blackwater and the deal 
has effectively closed.  Thank you very much for all of your hard work over 
the last couple of weeks and particluarly over the last couple of days.  This 
was a tough deal with a lot of moving parts and your participation in getting 
the first long-term power deal done with EES for Enron Compression Services 
Company is greatly appreciated.  We look forward to working on additional 
deals with more innovative structures going forward into 2001.

Sincerely,
Chris Hilgert

One of my GARP connections at El Paso has put forth a white paper for 
discussion. He is hoping it will be adopted across the industry.  He will be 
presenting it June 5th, at the next GARP meeting in Houston, to be hosted by 
El Paso at El Paso.  He is collecting feedback before the upcoming meeting.  
Please review, and comment to either myself of Lloyd at the address below.  


Thanks,
Frank

Harassment Avoidance FAQ

What do I do if I've already taken the class?
If you've already attended a session in the past while employed with Enron, 
you do not have to attend these sessions.  A "Refresher Course" will be 
offered at no cost.  

How do those of us attend the Harassment Avoidance if I do not work in 
Houston?
We are making the Harassment Avoidance sessions available on Video to be 
forwarded to your HR manager.   You are NOT encouraged to make travel 
arrangements to attend the Houston sessions.

Who pays the $50?
The $50 fee will be billed to your cost center. Individuals are not expected 
to pay.

Are there any additional dates than those listed on previous email?
Due to the number of people who have not attended in the past, we are making 
special arrangements to offer more classes in the next few months. 

It is important to note, that unless you've recieved a confirmation, you are 
not enrolled.  

All remaining questions or concerns need to be directed to David Foster 
(x.54360) or by email (david.foster@enron.com).

See below - I believe the amount that falls out of the books will be my 
entire discounted proceeds.  I am awaiting a call back on this but it looks 
like schedule E will be the best way to go.

Subject: Re: ECP Sub Notes  

Current plan is to sell the proceeds (in the money Swap received from El 
Paso) to Condor.  Primary issue relates to gain recognition.

The concern is that we are receiving and "in the money" NYMEX swap in return 
for the Notes.  The transaction would be considered a nonmonetary exchange 
pursuant to APB 29 (since we are not receiving cash).  Any gain under APB 29 
is deferred until cash is received (in excess of basis).  If the Notes were 
accounted for under FV, we could "fair value" the Notes immediately preceding 
the transaction and mitigate gain deferral under APB 29.  

To the contrary, if the Notes are Accrual, any gain on the disposition ($5 
million) would be deferred as of 12/31/00 (since we cannot take a gain on an 
accrual asset prior to the transfer/sale to Condor).

So the $5 million dollar question at hand is whether we can build an argument 
that the Notes should have been FV'd to begin with.

I believe our arguements in the past (for Accrual treatment) were weak and AA 
did not challenge at the time we adopted FV acctg for Structured Credit 
investments.  I think we should push the issue with AA and argue that the 
Note should have been marked to begin with.

If we cannot successfully argue for FV treatment of the Note currently, 
Condor would be entitled to a gain on the NYMEX swap once Global Finance 
monetizes the swap in 1Q 01 via a seperate QSPE transaction.

Basic issue is 4Q Gain vs. 1Q 01 gain for ENA.

Let me know what you think.

Thanks.

Subject: Re: ECP Sub Notes  

If you're referring to the debt originally with ECM (approx $158MM), then 
you're correct, it's in the Accrual book.  Regarding AA's question, how would 
the sale be impacted if fair value vs accrual ?

Subject: ECP Sub Notes

Are these notes in the Fair Value book or the Accrual book?

If I recall correctly, they are in the Accrual book.

If so, can we build an arguement that they should have been in the Fair Value 
book, but for some unforseen reason, they were included in the Accrual Book?

As you may or may not be aware, we are trying to sell ECP to El Paso by the 
end of the year.  One of the issues AA has brought up is whether our current 
treatment of the sub notes is Accrual or Fair Value.

Please advise.

Thanks.

Sandy,

As a result of recent contract re-negotiations, the proposed Cabot Oil & Gas 
Marketing Corporation deals in Terrebonne Parish has changed significantly.  
First, our reserve study has been completed and we have determined that the 
Turtle Bayou Field production is expected to last only 18 months.  Second, 
Cabot has balked at our tiered pricing proposal, so 100% of the production 
will be index priced.  Third, Cabot will only commit its working interest 
share of production, not its partners' share.  Fourth, one of the 4 wells 
(Castex #1) has been removed from the contract.  Finally, Cabot has indicated 
it will not accept a price less than index flat.

A revised expectation of volumes for the two Cabot deals is attached.  For 
the Transco Turtle Bayou Field, the intitial volume is expected to be 9,406 
Mmbtu/d for 01/2001 declining to 7,049 Mmbtu/d for 05/2002; please obtain a 
bid from the East desk for this gas for the period indicated.  For the 
Tennessee Kent Bayou Field, the initial volume is expected to be 9,570 
Mmbtu/d for 01/2001 declining to 7,121 Mmbtu/d for 12/2003; please obtain a 
bid from the East desk for this gas for the period indicated.  Thanks.

Sandy, we are still finalizing the contract and expected volumes with Cabot 
Oil & Gas Marketing Corporation for the two Terrebonne Parish deals 
referenced above, but we expect to enter into a long term deal prior to the 
end of December.  Would you please re-confirm that the notional pricing set 
forth in your 11/13/2000 memo for the two Cabot Terrebonne Parish deals is 
still valid for 5 years firm out of January 2001 for 80% of the volumes cited 
in my original request .  Thanks.

played it is not perfect(but working too).
The price is $ 1.500.000 and the shipping price could be around $250.000.
Thanks and regards.

Eric (Moon) and John, attached are the tickets for the physical part of the 
Preston VPP deal.  Please work with Will Kelly to have them entered into 
Sitara and provide me with the deal numbers.

Eric (Wardle), we'll need to get contract numbers established for the 
Counterparty Firm Agreement (ECT Merchant Investments) and the Counterparty 
Spot Agreement (St. Mary's Production LLC).  Have either of these agreements 
yet been executed?  If not, should we generate a spot gtc for the St. Mary's 
spot production?

manage the sale, nomination and transport of this production.

b.  firm purchase and firm transport for 90% of the wellhead volume, starting 
at 90% of 11,567 per day and declining as defined on the last tab labelled

c.  gas daily purchase and interruptible transport for the remaining 10% of 
the wellhead volume

Enron Upstream will keep the desk financially whole should volumes for the

John:

We are testing the new version of the Asian model from Research, and there 
are a couple of issues
we need to resolve with Paulo.  We should have a version ready for your 
testing by the end of this week.  
I will inform you and Errol when we complete our testing.

Thank you,

Here is the file for the Asian function. I am sorry about changing the

You may easily change it back to C style by using the replace function in

Commodity Transactions


John,
Thanks for stopping by.  For pre-paids and the like we have an expediated 
DASH process.  Since the counterparty is National Steel, we will need to get 
credit involved.  I've included Chip on this email regarding costs of funds.  

The expediated DASH process is for financings of embedded in commodity 
transactions.  This is to ensure that these type of transactions are reviewed 
considering funds flow and the ability to syndicate, as well as credit, 
documentation, and pricing.  This process is intended to be less 
comprehensive than a standard DASH and is to be used only for embedded 
financing transactions that are either (i) short- term or (ii) longer-term if 
with relatively highly-rated counterparties.


Thanks,

Frank

Hey John:

I need to get an updated notional price for Iroquois.  We are sending an 
updated  proposal to the customer next week so I will really appreciate it if 
you could send it to me as soon as you can.

Call me if you have any questions.

Maria Tefel

Ps.  Please also forward your model to me because I have to run several 
scenarios, in which the gas volumes vary.
Thanks!

Russell,

As discussed, attached is the model for the City of Mesa deal. Here is the 
summary....

ENA is currently selling gas to the City of Mesa at a fixed price of 
$3.74/mmbtu.  It is a 1 year deal that began in August of 2000 and expires in 
July 2001.
City of Mesa wants to use the value in this contract to buy down an new index 
(physical delivery) deal that begins August 2001 and ends January 2002.
They are willing to raise the price on the existing deal to about $4.50/mmbtu 
and use the value to discount the new floating index deal about $.30/mmbtu

The summary page is the best place to start and probably has all the info you 
need for your analysis.


Again, the orginators (Dave Fuller and Jeffrey Oh, Portland) are looking to 
transact on Monday (Jan 22).

Let me know if you have any questions.  I will touch base with you 
mid-morning on Monday.

Thanks in advance,

Eric

actually,  the hedges will be done at close - not pre-hedge by kcs [we have 
been working with credit, but they want something like $28 MM in escrow from 
kcs], so the hedges will be done at close in the name of ect merchant 
investments - then move to brazos.  last nite i called credit to confirm that 
ect merchant investments can do this big hedge - which i assume they can - it 
is enron.  but, i just wanted to cover all bases.

also, i have a question for you - when you guys get physical premium/discount 
numbers, do you go to the basis trader for this, or to an andy ring/susan 
perrira/kelly stevens/tom donohoe trader type? with peoples new roles, not 
sure who is doing what.   thanks.

joan

Attached is a revised draft of the Schedule.  The only changes are (1) Part 4 
paragraph (g) -- Forum For the Arbitration And Selection Of 
Arbitrators--Houston, Texas was changed to New York, New York and (2) a 
paragraph (q) was added to Part 5.  I apologize for the lack of machine 
black-line but it would not compare write for some reason.

A woman was very distraught at the fact that she had not  had a date
or
any
sex in quite some time.
She was afraid she might have something wrong with her so  she decided
to
seek the medical
expertise of a sex therapist. Her doctor  recommended that she see the
well-known Chinese sex therapist,
so she went to see him.
Upon entering the examination room, Dr. Chang said, "OK,  take off all
you
crose."
The woman did  as she was told.
"Now, get down and craw  reery, reery fass to odder side of room."
Again, the woman did as she was instructed.
Dr. Chang then said, "OK, now craw  reery, reery fass back to me."
So she  did.
Dr. Chang shook his head slowly and said, "Your probrem vewy bad. You
haf
Ed Zachary Disease.
Worse case I ever see. Dat why you not haf sex or  dates."
Worried, the woman asked  anxiously, "Oh my God, Dr. Chang, what is Ed
Zachary Disease?"
Dr. Chang looked the woman in the eye and replied, "Ed  Zachary
Disease is
when your face
rook  Ed Zachary rike your ass."

Joan,

The BOA ticket was established by John Griffith.

Two deal tickets are necessary for St. Mary's in order to segregate that 
portion of the excess volumes on which a firm delivery guarantee to the East 
Desk was made and origination was taken from that portion of the excess 
volumes which are delivered to the desk on an interruptible basis and priced 
accordingly.

George,

There should not be a deal tic for BOA [55941].  The Brazos tic #541136 has 
100% of the VPP vols, which is correct.  The other tic should not exist.  I 
am not sure if you put this in, or if John Griffith did this when the name 
change from St. Mary's to Brazos took place.  Please let me know what I need 
to do in order to get this removed/corrected. 

Also, when things slow down, we need to discuss the 2 deal tics [firm and 
spot].  Per the contract with Preston, there s/b only one tic - all the gas 
at IF TGT + 0.0025.

thanks.
joan

John,

I work with Davis Thames and Chris Herron and am getting ready to move 
forward on another $500 million prepay with Chase & other parties (which are 
still being finalized).  Wanted to see if you would have some time to talk - 
let me know.  Thanks again.

John,
Thanks for stopping by.  For pre-paids and the like we have an expediated 
DASH process.  Since the counterparty is National Steel, we will need to get 
credit involved.  I've included Chip on this email regarding costs of funds.  

The expediated DASH process is for financings of embedded in commodity 
transactions.  This is to ensure that these type of transactions are reviewed 
considering funds flow and the ability to syndicate, as well as credit, 
documentation, and pricing.  This process is intended to be less 
comprehensive than a standard DASH and is to be used only for embedded 
financing transactions that are either (i) short- term or (ii) longer-term if 
with relatively highly-rated counterparties.


Thanks,

Frank

John - thanks for the kind words about Colorforms.? It was a lot of fun 
putting together and the feedback so far has been very complimentary - 
they've already run out of the color brochures so people must be interested 
in learning more.? Thanks for coming to the opening and supporting the show.? 
It means a lot to have friends believe in my projects.? 

I haven't seen the Core show yet but am looking forward to it.? What did you 
think?? I heard that Jessica's piece is real nice.

I look forward to seeing you two soon - maybe we could talk about DJ 
equipment then.? BTW, do you still have my Anokha CD.? I was looking for it 
the other day and couldn't find it.? Not a big deal if you don't.? I'll just 
pick up another copy.

Take care,

Baloy, Grils Baloy

Ned, I reviewed our work with John Griffith.  He pointed out that I was 
pricing the option and all commodity prices at "MID".  He suggested that I 
remind you of that fact.  I have not gotten from the traders, or made an 
estimate of, the differential for bid/offer spread.  I can incorporate that 
information into further updates if you like.  We can discuss this at our 
next meeting.

Please be sure to inform Jean and Chris that the numbers you currently have 
DO NOT include the above factor.  

John did not have additional ideas on how to hedge this transaction given the 
current agreement in place with Dow.  He suggested, as we have discussed, 
going to Dow to get their cost for a firm delivery schedule.  While we have a 
maximum that we would be willing to pay, they may offer something 
less--largely based on their own understanding of their future brine 
obligations.

Let me know when you need more information.

Thanks

I have an opening at Capp St. Gallery at CCAC April 19 6 p.m.-9pm called
PLOB

PLOB is an enclosed environment created out of hundreds of identical plastic
translucent modules. Each module has a light and single different sound that
are activated from movement.

Plastic Blob is a plob -
A plob is the state between liquid plastic and solid material object.
A Plob is a noun, but is also a verb. I plob in a state of endlessness.
Capp Gallery is turned into a non-stop amorphous plastic scape that denotes
a world with no boundaries - The space extends itself via plastic organic
modules of repetition d a continuum of surface based on a conventional
Cartesian grid. Plob is a metaphor for a continuous world, a neutral
landscape, and an undulating surface that is reconfigurable and sizable ad
infinitum.

The lightweight plastic moldings are rearrangeable abstractions that are a
growth from the floor, walls, and ceiling - an extension of the natural
landscape to the artificial landscape. All the notions of objects as
singular are dispelled and are replaced by an environment rising out of the
ground. The continuous white field is surrounded by field of fluorescence to
allude to the world of technology, to digital space and arbiters, as a
recluse from infotrophy.

Inevitably our entire physical landscape will merge and connect. Furniture
and space merge, Object and environment, City and town, water and ground,
highway to highway, being to being.

Please come.


Sincerely, Karim Rashid

John,

You are correct, when you compute the historical volatility you need to use 
252 days to annualize the volatility.
This is because the historical data only existed for trading days. 

The common practice here at Enron for computing Time to maturity is Calendar 
Days (= Maturity date - valuation date).
Therefore the days in Year is 365.25.  So the implied volatility from the 
EIMPVOL function uses 365.25 days as one year.

If you want to convert you can apply the following formula

historical vol * sqrt(252)    vs.  implied vol * sqrt(365.25).

Let me know if this helps. 

Zimin

Subject: Historical Volatility

Zimin,

I have a question about historical volatility.  The way I have been 
calculating historical volatility is that I take the standard deviation of 
the log returns of the price settles.  I then take that number (daily 
volatility) and multiply by the square root of the number of trading days to 
come up with an annualized volatility.  The number of trading days that I 
have been using is 252, however I do not know if this is correct.  What I am 
trying to do is calculate a historical volatility that would be comparable to 
the implied volatility that we are calculating our books with.  The implied 
volatilities are iterated using the euro function.  I get a straddle quote 
and I iterate what volatility would be used to come up with that price ( I 
also look at the eimvol function).  I know that we use a 365.25 trading day 
convention in pricing our options, does this mean that to come up with a 
comparable historical volatility number I need to use 365.25 to convert the 
daily historical volatility to an annualized volatility?

Thanks again for your help.

John Griffith

I just wanted to update you on what Samer has done so far.  Due to an 
unexpected urgency of certain projects last week, Samer did not have time to 
start working on  the Report 1 until yesturday.  We will update you later 
today for the completion of it.  As of Report 2 (report to pull deal # and 
delivery point), I sent you the query as well as the data yesturday.  If you 
need additional changes on this please let me know.  I am still waiting for 
Jessica (Arthur Andersen) to get with me on the details for the Report 3 
(TAGG-LISA Reconciliation Report).  Until Jessica forward me all the 
necessary information, I will get started on it.  If you have any questions 
please call me.  Thanks.

Thank you for your kind e-mail. I think that Omni and Arp are the same in
importance. If you have the room, go with Omni.

Let me know if you will purchase any Pleasurscape pieces.

Scott,

Attached are the two deals we booked last week for Jared.

They are basically identical, with only slight modification on the price for 
June-Sep.  Let me know which deal they want to unwind.  I need to get risk to 
run a mini-book so I can tie it to the model.

I will come up in a few minutes to discuss.

Eric

John,

Included is an updated diagram of the proposed Chase prepay that includes 
Stoneville - please let me know if you have any questions.  With regard to 
Stoneville, Enron Hydrocarbons Marketing Corp. entered into an agreement in 
December 1994 whereby Enron would sell to Mahonia and buy-back from 
Stoneville (Stoneville Aegean Ltd) - a transaction very similar to this 
prepay.  Thanks.

Michael

I have placed the new version of the model on O:\_Dropbox\modelgriffith3.xls

The second function works off the "Skew4" tab, and the name of the function 
is "calcskew2"
The inputs to the calcskew2 function are the same, except for "a" and "b", 
which are now
"anew" and "bnew".

Regards,

Hector

Hi, John,

I have another request for you: Heather and Chu Chu Wang (another Associate 
in my group) are working on the Oyster Creek deal.  Because Chu Chu in on 
vacation now, I just took over his job to continue with the deal.  Heather 
wants me to find out the updated Houston Ship Channel gas curve from 2001 to 
2014.  We only need annual numbers.  

Thanks a lot!

Hi John,

I've attached workbooks that compare implied volatility from market data to 
ENA curves for June, October, December contracts.  But I'm not sure that I 
have the most current skew table.  For the attached workbooks I just took 
last months table and rolled the contracts up a month, so what was May-01 
became June-01, etc.  Have you made any other adjustments to the skew table? 

I'd be happy to come up and talk about these files with you if you want?  
Thanks.
ken

Per Schroeder, a good number to use for crude basis is the $3.00.  H is 
meeting with Tom [mid con properties] on Tues, and Sam [GC properties] on Wed.

Regarding BTU factors on the gas spreadsheet for the midcon area, these 
factors are all wellhead.  Randy will be providing the tailgate factors to me.

Regarding missing marketing info: MELP has been deleted from the deal and 
South Drew is a PUD, not yet drilled.

GAS
The below spreadsheet has all my info re the gas marketing [still not 
"pretty"] for all the fields except MEPLP & South Drew.  I have an email to 
Harry to find out whom I am to talk to about these 2 fields.  

So far, there are 39 delivery points in the mid continent/Michigan area, 25 
delivery points in the gulf coast area [including the 7 VPP points], approx 
20 points go thru plants, 24 go thru gathering lines.  There is a lot going 
on here.  I know we have not discussed what we might want to take physically 
[and I have not discussed this with anyone on the trading or wellhead desks], 
but my gut feel and recommendation is to take all the crude physically, and 
re gas, take the bigger receipt points that flow directly to a mainline 
connection, and the VPP vols.  

I have updated the basis numbers, updated all the gathering fees, fuel ... 
and using vols that I have been given by KCS, the weighted average basis 
number is around $0.25 [$0.2443, go figure].  I still need MI basis numbers, 
but these s/b positive to NYMEX, which should bring the wtd average down.  I 
think everyone knows this, but keep in mind, I have not read any of the 
contracts, all information is hearsay, all numbers are assuming that the 
current prices and fees are to remain constant for the next 5 yrs, but for 
now, this the best we have, especially since I was given this information 
less than 48 hrs ago - the information received originally from the Houston 
office was incorrect.

In my email yesterday, I wrote that there are several delivery points where 
the pricing is POP.  My initial thinking and concern with this, was that if 
KCS had, let's say, an 80/80 deal, and the marketer sold the gas and the 
NGL's for whatever price(s), then, KCS would get 80% of that amount.  which 
makes it impossible to do a clean hedge.  However, the deals KCS has, is that 
they receive [in this instance, in general] 80% of the residue gas, at a set 
IFGMR price.  Thus, we can decide on a volume, we know the pricing, and we 
can hedge.  No issue.

I did receive a binder today with all the gulf coast gas marketing contracts 
[and briefs].  I have not looked at any of this so I am not sure what all is 
in there, but I do not think gathering, processing... contracts are 
included.  Merrill - by chance, have you reviewed any of these?

I s/b receiving the mid con contracts/briefs on Friday.




OIL

Getting the crude info has been harder than the gas.  There are about 14 
fields in the gulf coast area - totaling a little under 500 BOPD.  There are 
about 16 fields in the mid con/Michigan area - totaling a little over 2,300 
BOPD, of which, 1,440 b/d is sour, and 530 is in Michigan.  For the fields 
Mills Ranch, Oak Hill and Pittsburg, the operator markets the crude under 
their JOA.  Thus, I have no information re these fields.  All the crude is 
termed up for the next month or so, so it will soon be available for you to 
take in kind.  There is no crude under the Hall Houston VPP.

Don - I have highlighted in bold the field where Randy [KCS Tulsa] said the 
oil is, for sure, obviously, sour. At first he was telling me that what 
deemed 40' means is that the crude is sour, but he's really getting a sweet 
price.   Needless to say, he is checking with their crude oil marketing 
person - Tom Kivisto, whom I know you know, to find out what field(s) really 
are sour.  On your chair are the two spreadsheets for each region.  The mid 
con spreadsheet is also below, the gulf coast spreadsheet is only a hard 
copy.  Give me a call and let's discuss.  We are currently using a basis of 
$3.00, and any notional basis number would greatly be appreciated.




Larry - call me and let's talk about what you need.

To follow up on our conversation about the Pipe Option Book, Errol will 
provide post id's for Friday's COB
to calc the pipe options book with the skew table. As I asked on the phone 
please provide two calcs, one calc
for the pipe options deals with and with out skew and another calc with the 
NYMEX options deals with and without skew.

In addition to this, please recalc  1078960 & 1078963 for the ngpropt book.  
These calcs are for puts and for calls for COB 3-23.

If you have any questions please contact me at 3-9257 with any questions

Just to let you know. Fraud just called me about the case. they have received 
the paperwork and they are ready to credit the full amount to the account 
however instead I 'm going ot debit new account for $4504.30.

And tomorrow fraud will credit new account for the same amount.

This way we do not have to open the old account. In other words we trying to 
minimixe exposure as possible and follow procedures.
again your account will be debited only temp.

John,

Looks like no confirm since only physical (which seems odd that Stoneville 
sent us a confirm).  I think we should probably be consistent with Mahonia.  
Let me know your thoughts.  Thanks again for all your help.

Mike, there really isn't a confirm with Mahonia, the FSA (forward sale 
agreement) defines our delivery obligation.  When John books that, it should 
then go to the physical desk to be booked into Sitara.  If you have trouble, 
call Brad McKay and he'll give you a contact to book the delivery 
obligation.  Remind him of the fixed price purchase obligation when he books 
it so that he doesn't think he's got an open short to play with.

In our deals the financial swap confirm was written by Chase.  I don't think 
there was ever a formal confirm on the floating physical purchase.

Enjoyed the drink last night - need to do it more often.

Quick question - did you prepare the confirm between ENA and Mahonia?  We 
were having the confirm people do that and they were playing stupid.  I am 
still thinking about your earning game - the only issue I can think of is 
selling a certain part of the fiber (i.e., that represents a certain physical 
asset) where gas is more fungible.  However, that can be gotten around.  
Enjoy and thanks.

Mesquite has an internal approval process which cannot be completed until 
late this week or early next.  We have slowed our approval process to 
parallel theirs.  We will sign doc's when we have both received all necessary 
internal approvals.  Signing is now expected to be early next week.

In addition we have resolved the two minor commercial issues mentioned in 
last update.  The final price has been adjusted slightly - impact on 
transaction value is minimal.   See the attached excel spreadsheet for the 
new Annex 1.02 numbers for the Mesquite swaps (also the assumed closing date 
has been moved to 27-Dec).  The Merlin issue has been resolved with an 
indemnity from ENA in the unlikely event El Paso must pay a make whole 
premium on the refinancing of Merlin's $30mm participation (maximum exposure 
approx. $675k).

One additional issue has arisen concerning a consent right by the Bayonne 
minority partners in the event the Managing Venturer is no longer an Enron 
affiliate.  This consent right was granted at the time of the McNair 
acquisition and was not part of the primary project documents.  This right 
was not recognized in V&E's initial review of consent requirements for this 
transaction.  Of the three minority partners, Mission will be acquired in the 
next few days by ECP and ECP is in final negotiations to acquire Calpine's 
interest by year end.  Consent from the remaining partner, ANP, is not 
expected to be a problem.  This or some other work around will be added as a 
condition precedent to closing.  While we still expect to close by year end 
this new development adds an unwelcome uncertainty to our process.

We will recirculate the DASH, adjusted as necessary for these changes, as 
soon as practical.

The structure is critical. I don't want to cash out the entire fixed price 
position and then turn around and sell them index gas at $8.  Then I have a 
huge receivable risk that has no MTM offset.  I'd rather reset the fixed 
price to somwhere in between, especially if they are hurting for cash.

I'm unclear, but evidently we sold $2 dollar gas to them (back in 1996) and 
they are asking to cash out...I think we end up paying them roughly 20 
million dollars.  I'll give you better/more details as I learn them.

John,
Thanks for stopping by.  For pre-paids and the like we have an expediated 
DASH process.  Since the counterparty is National Steel, we will need to get 
credit involved.  I've included Chip on this email regarding costs of funds.  

The expediated DASH process is for financings of embedded in commodity 
transactions.  This is to ensure that these type of transactions are reviewed 
considering funds flow and the ability to syndicate, as well as credit, 
documentation, and pricing.  This process is intended to be less 
comprehensive than a standard DASH and is to be used only for embedded 
financing transactions that are either (i) short- term or (ii) longer-term if 
with relatively highly-rated counterparties.


Thanks,

Frank

George/Sandy, 
Are you guys nominating/confirming this gas on Tennessee Passkey and Transco 
Transit for December or are we?  
Are there going to be two sets of tickets for each deal (one for the firm 
volume and one for the swing)?  We'll need those deal numbers when you have 
them.. 
Are you scheduling this internally in Unify or are we? 
Please let me know as soon as possible as noms for December 1 are due to the 
pipelines by 11:30 this Thursday morning!  THANKS!

Sandy,

Attached are the tickets we intend to submit to document the two (2) deals 
with Cabot for December.  Once you and John have had an opportunity to review 
these tickets, Melissa and I would like to come down and walk them through 
the system.  Thanks.

Cabot has agreed to do the December deals at index minus $0.01 for 80% of 
their volume and gas daily minus $0.01 for the remaining 20% of their 
volume.  We expect that they will soon execute the long term paper providing 
for index minus $0.005 for the 80% firm traunch and gas daily minus $0.005 
for the 20% spot traunch; a set of new long term tickets will be prepared and 
submitted upon execution of the long term paper.

If this mechanism of documenting our deals works, we intend to submit all 
future deals in a similar manner.

Phil:

Just wanted to check on this differential:

Destin versus Henry Hub - $0.04 per MMBtu

You indicated that this is a 10 year differential, 2004 +.

Is this to buy or to sell?  Is there any difference or is it very liquid?


Regards.
Les

Attached is the model  we used to price gas for Kern River at the end of 
October.  As you can see, we priced gas at two delivery points:  Pastoria and 
Opal.  I hope this is in any way useful to you, if not, we can discuss the 
delivery point with Knippa or Andrew when you come at 10am today.

Thanks and let me know if this is useful.

Lia, Jay Hartman (281.367.8697) has verbally advised us that the SL 14521 #1 
well will be shut-in for a short period and has therefore requested that we 
reduce the existing nomination for 01/2001 at TGT meter 9502 on sitara deal 
540814 from 316 Mmbtu/d (13% of 2,434 Mmbtu/d) to 0.  You indicated you will 
reduce the nomination to 0 for the entire month; we will notify you once 
production re-commences and the nomination should be re-entered at its 
previous level.

Jill, this gas was purchased from Hunt in December by the East Desk, so no 
Wellhead Desk changes are required for this month.

Sam, the counterparty record for St. Mary's Production LLC (BA 88272) does 
not include a DnB status.  It is my understanding that our East Desk cannot 
schedule St. Mary's gas without a DnB number.  Could you please have a DnB

Sitara and provide me with the deal numbers.

Eric (Wardle), we'll need to get contract numbers established for the 
Counterparty Firm Agreement (ECT Merchant Investments) and the Counterparty 
Spot Agreement (St. Mary's Production LLC).  Have either of these agreements 
yet been executed?  If not, should we generate a spot gtc for the St. Mary's

Eric & John

ECT Merchant Investments Corp. has entered into a Volumetric Production 
Payment agreement with St. Mary's Production LLC which provides for the 
dedication of St. Mary's non-operated gas production from the Hunt Oil 
Company operated Myette Point Northwest Field.  ECT Merchant Investments 
Corp. has arranged for the Enron North America Upstream Wellhead Desk to 
manage the sale, nomination and transport of this production.

Could you please get us a quote to purchase this wellhead gas on a firm basis 
based on the following:

a.  18 month term commencing 1/1/2001 and ending 6/30/2003

b.  firm purchase and firm transport for 90% of the wellhead volume, starting 
at 90% of 11,567 per day and declining as defined on the last tab labelled 
"Volume" on the spreadsheet attached

c.  gas daily purchase and interruptible transport for the remaining 10% of 
the wellhead volume

Enron Upstream will keep the desk financially whole should volumes for the 
90% firm component fail to show up on any given day of the 18 month term

Drafts of proposed Deal Tickets are attached.

Enron Benefit Plans 
Summary Annual Report    

The basic financial and insurance information on the back of this page, as 
well as the material below, provide a Summary Annual Report for the Enron 
Benefit Plans.  The annual report for each plan has been filed with the 
Internal Revenue Service, as required by the Employee Retirement Income 
Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). 

NOTE:  You may receive a report for a benefit plan in which you are not a 
participant or under which you are not entitled.  Entitlement to benefits 
under any of the plans is based on the provisions of each plan.


Your Rights to Additional Information

You have the right to receive, upon request, a copy of the full annual 
report, or any part thereof, for any plan.  For insured plans, insurance 
information (including any sales commissions paid by insurance carriers) is 
shown in the annual reports.

To obtain a copy of the full annual report, or any part thereof, for any 
plan, write or call:

Enron Corp
1400 Smith Street
Houston, TX  77002-7311

(713) 853-6161

You also have the right to receive from the plan administrator, on request 
and at no charge, a statement of the assets and liabilities of the plan and 
accompanying notes, or a statement of income and expenses of the plan and 
accompanying notes, or both.  If you request a copy of the full annual report 
from the plan administrator, these two statements and accompanying notes will 
be included as part of that report.

You also have the legally protected right to examine the annual report at the 
main office of the plan (Enron Corp., 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX  
77002-7311) and at the U.S. Department of Labor in Washington, D.C., or to 
obtain a copy from the U.S. Department of Labor upon payment of copying 
costs.  Requests to the Department should be addressed to:  Public Disclosure 
Room, N-5638, Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration, U.S. Department of 
Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20210.

John:

(1) Regarding OptionGrid, Samer can provide you a version that does not write 
out empty grids to the file by tomorrow.  He will then try to increase the 
max. number of grids from 95 to 320.  And we will write the file to a common 
drive that you can access from Windows, without having to FTP the file from 
the Unix to the NT drive.

I will check with my director (Zhiyong Wei) to see if we can move up the 
timeline for the OptionGrid running on Windows project.

(2) Regarding actual gamma: 

PriceDelta = Today's Mid. Price - Prior Day's Mid. Price

Actual delta     = Prior Day's (Option Library) delta * PriceDelta
Actual gamma = Prior Days' (Option Library) gamma * 0.5 * (PriceDelta * 
PriceDelta)

(3) Regarding the Asian model, the number of calendar days in a year is 
365.25 for the new version using calendar days.
We have to merge the new version into the current production PortCalc that 
has the vol. skew changes.  We should have that in a couple of days. I will 
inform Errol when we are ready for him to start testing.

(4) Dave is looking into changing PortCalc to provide 2 actual Vegas - one 
without skew and one with skew.
>From our preliminary analysis, it would require PortCalc, database and report 
changes to do this.
Would you also require 2 predictive Vegas and also sensitivities (i.e. +/- 1, 
2.5, 5 or 10 % vol.) changes also?

John,

The LNG guys wanted to look at some rough economics for building pipe.  Maybe 
you can point me in the right direction.

They would like to know how much it would cost to build a line from Wrens to 
Transco.  Approx 90 miles.
Additionally, they would like to know the cost of building a line from Elba 
going under the river twice to Plant McIntosh owned by Southern Co.  This is 
particularly interesting because the rate would be approximately $.22 for a 
backhaul on IT but we could get a discount if threaten to bypass.  Knowing 
the economics could help steer us or Southern Co. on how much of a discount 
to ask for.

Let me know.  

Thanks.

Eric (Moon) and John, attached are the tickets for the physical part of the 
Preston VPP deal.  Please work with Will Kelly to have them entered into 
Sitara and provide me with the deal numbers.

Eric (Wardle), we'll need to get contract numbers established for the 
Counterparty Firm Agreement (ECT Merchant Investments) and the Counterparty 
Spot Agreement (St. Mary's Production LLC).  Have either of these agreements 
yet been executed?  If not, should we generate a spot gtc for the St. Mary's 
spot production?

Eric & John

ECT Merchant Investments Corp. has entered into a Volumetric Production 
Payment agreement with St. Mary's Production LLC which provides for the 
dedication of St. Mary's non-operated gas production from the Hunt Oil 
Company operated Myette Point Northwest Field.  ECT Merchant Investments 
Corp. has arranged for the Enron North America Upstream Wellhead Desk to 
manage the sale, nomination and transport of this production.

Could you please get us a quote to purchase this wellhead gas on a firm basis 
based on the following:

a.  18 month term commencing 1/1/2001 and ending 6/30/2003

b.  firm purchase and firm transport for 90% of the wellhead volume, starting 
at 90% of 11,567 per day and declining as defined on the last tab labelled 
"Volume" on the spreadsheet attached

c.  gas daily purchase and interruptible transport for the remaining 10% of 
the wellhead volume

Enron Upstream will keep the desk financially whole should volumes for the 
90% firm component fail to show up on any given day of the 18 month term

Drafts of proposed Deal Tickets are attached.

John:

I need you to assist me in repricing Kern River.  We are sending a package to 
the customer on Monday and will need to reprice the gas swap before we do 
so.  

I am also attaching a spreadsheet, which includes delivery location and 
monthly MMBTUs.  I would really appreciate it if you send me the model as 
well because the monthly volumes will change with different scenarios.

Call me if you have any questions.

Thanks.

As a result of discussions for capacity to serve electric generation sites in 
Georgia through Transco's Momentum Expansion, Transco has proposed a rate of 
$0.32 plus 2.35% fuel for receipts in Zone 3 (Station 65) and deliveries in 
Zone 4.  If you assume fuel on a gas cost of $4.00 ($.095 fuel), then the 
total rate is $0.415.  

Assuming the aforementioned rate, Southern Company can pay Transco $0.415 or 
purchase gas from Elba and backhaul on Sonat at a rate of $0.22 which would 
netback to Elba at Hub + $0.195.  If you assume a basis of $0.01 for gas on 
Transco Zone 3, then the netback goes up to Hub plus $0.205.  

Transco has also offered a $0.27 Momentum rate for receipts from Station 
85/Destin (Zone 4) and deliveries in Georgia.  With fuel at 1.9% and $4.00 
gas, the total rate is $0.35.  However, basis at Station 85 is $0.04 and that 
takes the delivered cost up to Hub + $0.39.
This delivered price would yield a backhaul netback to Elba at Hub + $0.17.

Since Southern Company can site generation in Sonat Zone 2 (Alabama) or Zone 
3 (Georgia), they are probably unwilling to pay this high a netback price at 
Elba.  Additionally, most power developers will not commit to a baseload 
quantity given that they will be serving a peaking market.  One alternative 
is to sell to existing firm shippers on the Sonat system that would view Elba 
as a savings on variable cost on their FT agreement.  The net is a Hub + 
$0.10 at Elba assuming a basis of $.04 at Destin.  

Through discussions with Phil Demoes, Southern Company has stated that a 
price of Hub + $0.20 was out of the question.  Phil indicates that we could 
probably strike a deal between their bid of Hub + $0.12 and Hub + $0.17.

I talked to Zimin today and he agreed with me on the change to the model.  
There are basically 3 columns in the model that need to be changed.  Let me

Subject: St. Mary's FEB First of the Month Nom, Myette Point Northwest Field
 St. Mary Parish, LA


for feb,

VPP gas: sitara tic #541136 shows 11,136/d, when it should really be 11,480/d.

The other 344/d is on sitara tic #555941; the two tickets together total 
11,480/d.  You'll remember that the Bank of America tics were established by 
John Griffith's team.

and re the excess gas tics [below], they do not match my first of the month 
[FOM] info below.  Did the FOM change?  

The nom was in fact changed by Hunt at 2:00 pm on 1/31/2001.  Hunt had 
inadvertantly provided you with North Central's nomination for the low volume 
meter, 9502, instead of Preston's nomination.  Thus, the 2,997/d on the North 
Central page (note the 25% WI on your original documentation - I missed this 
clue also) provided to us on 1/25/2001 became 2,012/d on the Preston page 
provided to us on 1/31/2001.

The GDA tic s/b 10% of the total excess amount, and this is less than that.  
Am I missing something?

The Gas Daily ticket won't necessarily be 10% of the total.  Here's what we 
do.  We book the VPP volume on one set of firm tickets (actually 2 sets, 
since the VPP has been broken into a Brazos traunch and a Bank of America 
traunch) - see 541136, 555941, 553654 & 555681 (the last two tickets are the 
internal desk to desk deals).  Then, based on Robert Cook's team's reserve 
review, we book as much excess gas on a second set of firm tickets as the 
reserve report indicates (the Firm Excess volume) - in this case, for the 
month of February, that number is 4,618/d - see 540814 & 594648.  Finally, we 
"book" any residue remaining after the VPP volume and the Firm Excess volume 
on a set of spot, Gas Daily tickets - see 554222 & 555729.  Originally, when 
we mistakenly thought the nomination at meter 9502 was 2,997/d, the 
corresponding spot, Gas Daily volume was 17,216/d minus 11,480/d minus 
4,618/d or 1,118/d.  When the renomination of meter 9502 (a downward 
adjustment of 985/d) took place, the 1,118/d became 133/d.  Thus, the total 
booked, 16,231/d matches the 16,231/d nominated. 

Excess gas priced at IF: sitara tic #540814
Excess gas priced at GDA: sitara tic #554222 

For your information, we deliver herewith a copy of the spreadsheet we will 
use to track this deal for February.



thanks George x3-6992

George,

This is a follow up to the hard copies of the first of the month information 
that I put on your chair earlier today.  Below is a summary/break out of the 
volumes and pricing.

The VPP nom should be in the name of Brazos, and the excess in Preston's 
name.  Do you know has Hunt been informed that the VPP nom will be in Brazos' 
name?

It does not matter to me how you break out the VPP vols between the 2 
delivery points - whatever is easiest for you.



This spreadsheet is the same as what is above....

paragraph (g) -- Forum For the Arbitration And Selection Of 
Arbitrators--Houston, Texas was changed to New York, New York and (2) a 
paragraph (q) was added to Part 5.  I apologize for the lack of machine 
black-line but it would not compare write for some reason.

John,

These are the files that we talked about on our very first meeting some weeks 
ago.  I originally made these for Mario de la Ossa, an options trader on the 
Crude Products desk.  

VolSkew.xls takes market data for options with different strikes and premiums 
and calculates the skew.  FetchContract.xls calculates descriptive statistics 
for contracts based on historic pricing data.  

Feel free to give me a call if you have any questions about the files.  I 
would be happy to modify them to fit your setup and pricing models.

Q. I=01,m not currently a Road Runner customer. What is the process?

A. Your address will be checked to verify Road Runner serviceability. If =

Q. Are there any installation charges?

A. All Enron customers will be charged a fee of $39.95 for a standard=20

getting your  computer through the Click at Home project, a network interfa=

At the risk of further damage to my credibility, I have agreed with David 
Field to schedule signing for 2:00 PM, Thursday, 14-Dec at V&E's offices.  An 
amended DASH has been signed by RAC and is now making the rounds.  

In exchange for the slight reduction in price we obtained a minor credit 
spread protection agreement from EPG.  A term sheet describing the proposed 
terms of this agreement has gone over to El Paso today - see Lewis Worthy for 
any additional information you may require.  The maximum value of this 
agreement is $1mm and would be paid in the event credit spreads on El Paso 
debt widen in the market during the first quarter by approx. 18 bp - this 
represents 50% of the loss in value should such a move occur.  This minor 
addition to our agreement will be finalized over the next 45 hours prior to 
signing.

As to Bayonne consents, the Mission interest was acquired by ECP last week 
and EPG is attempting to accelerate pending negotiations to acquire the 
Calpine interest as the preferred way to resolve our consent issue.

Please be sure that you have completed all necessary/ongoing reviews by early 
Thursday.  Call me, Lisa, Chris or Lewis for any assistance you may require.

Thank you again for your timely assistance in these matters.

Dea John,
I didn't sell the Orgone chair,I was hoping for $750,but I
would negotiate.It costs $280 to send to you local airport,or more door to
door 3-4 days.I have a swivel base Gluon chair and ottoman in black leather
coming.That set is $4200 but won't be here for 12 weeks.I can order that for
you any time with wool or leather. I will also possibly be getting the
'Wicker' and 'Embryo' chair also.I can get them to order,but they are not
cheap.Also can get Newson dish-racks for $45.Let me know if you are
interested in anything,
Cheers John.

John,

Please find details for the distributor for the Coast chair manufactured by
MAGIS:


Leif Petersen Inc. 15 Woodland Avenue San Rafael CA 94901

T+1 415 45 355 00
F+1 415 48 507 76

Personally I like the Orgone chair very much but I don't know how to compare
it with his other pieces...It is to my mind quite unique and a beautiful
piece to look at standing alone in a space.


Regards,


Patsy Youngstein

Hi, John,

How are you?  Doug told me this morning that the Indeck Corinth Project 
(which we worked on last October) has come back.  He needs to update the 
following curves from Feb. 2001 to Jul. 2015:

1. NYMEX Gas Curve
2. Basis Differential ANR and CNG North CG.  

I am attaching the file you sent me last time for your reference.  

Also, you provided us the historical Henry Hub price till last October.  
Could you please give me the historical prices for the most recent three 
months?  I am also attaching that file for your convenience.  

Thanks a lot!

Ying

Subject:?USA freezed for a moment!!!!

One fine morning, every thing was going smooth as usual. Suddenly,the
motors screeched with a sudden brake, when every one in the city couldn't
believe what had happened to America. It was in New York where the scene was

going very hectic. People cried out of shame.
Many where blaming the former president Mr. Bill Clinton. Hillary stood
staring at her darling husband. Clinton came to the crowd and said in
his words, "I'm Innocent, It's really dramatic to say I'm the only man
behind all these cases. Slowly, I feel I'm loosing confidence on myself".
Are you curious to know what had happened ...

Subject: Brazos VPP's

Joan and Eric:  Based on our (Eric Moon and I) discussion with Fred Lagrasta, 
the financial hedge related to the Brazos VPP's should be handled through 
Fred's group.  We need to make sure that the volume that is given to Fred (or 
Vikas or Ross) is only 97% of the VPP firm volumes.   Please let myself or 
Eric Moon know just as soon as you go to Fred's group for a quote so that we 
may be prepared for the physical side of the deal.

Fred, Vikas and Ross:  If you go to John Arnold and the basis trader for the 
quote, we need to let them know that this relates to the Brazos VPP's and 
that his quote is going to be known by Bank of America.  If executed, Bank of 
America will know that Enron is long and the exact volume and term.  They 
will be taking 3% of the deal at our quote (for accounting reasons, 3% of the 
hedge on these transactions has to be executed with a counterparty other than 
Enron, that counterparty is Bank of America).  Vikas and Ross, would you guys 
also call when these go through just a check.

Please call with any questions or concerns.  Thanks

John Griffith

Eric & John

ECT Merchant Investments Corp. has entered into a Volumetric Production 
Payment agreement with St. Mary's Production LLC which provides for the 
dedication of St. Mary's non-operated gas production from the Hunt Oil 
Company operated Myette Point Northwest Field.  ECT Merchant Investments 
Corp. has arranged for the Enron North America Upstream Wellhead Desk to 
manage the sale, nomination and transport of this production.

Could you please get us a quote to purchase this wellhead gas on a firm basis 
based on the following:

a.  18 month term commencing 1/1/2001 and ending 6/30/2003

b.  firm purchase and firm transport for 90% of the wellhead volume, starting 
at 90% of 11,567 per day and declining as defined on the last tab labelled 
"Volume" on the spreadsheet attached

c.  gas daily purchase and interruptible transport for the remaining 10% of 
the wellhead volume

Enron Upstream will keep the desk financially whole should volumes for the 
90% firm component fail to show up on any given day of the 18 month term

Drafts of proposed Deal Tickets are attached.

Victor,

Are you guys nominating/confirming this gas on Tennessee Passkey and Transco 
Transit for December or are we?  We expect that as the deals are entered into 
Sitara, you will be asked to nominate and confirm this gas.

Are there going to be two sets of tickets for each deal (one for the firm 
volume and one for the swing)?  We'll need those deal numbers when you have 
them..  Actually, we've prepared 3 deal tickets for each deal.  One ticket is 
for the 80% firm purchase (first of the month index pricing) from Cabot by 
Upstream, the second ticket is for the 20% spot purchase (gas daily pricing) 
from Cabot by Upstream and the third ticket is the desk-to-desk transaction 
in which Upstream sells the 80% firm volume to the East Desk - this is the 
ticket which will generate origination to the Upstream Desk, if applicable.
   
Are you scheduling this internally in Unify or are we?  You are.

Sandy,

Attached are the tickets we intend to submit to document the two (2) deals 
with Cabot for December.  Once you and John have had an opportunity to review 
these tickets, Melissa and I would like to come down and walk them through 
the system.  Thanks.

Cabot has agreed to do the December deals at index minus $0.01 for 80% of 
their volume and gas daily minus $0.01 for the remaining 20% of their 
volume.  We expect that they will soon execute the long term paper providing 
for index minus $0.005 for the 80% firm traunch and gas daily minus $0.005 
for the 20% spot traunch; a set of new long term tickets will be prepared and 
submitted upon execution of the long term paper.

If this mechanism of documenting our deals works, we intend to submit all 
future deals in a similar manner.

George x3-6992

Jesus and Joan,

 I would like to schedule a meeting on both of your calendars sometime on 
Wednesday or Thursday (Jan. 24 or 25) afternoon (after 4 pm.) to discuss the 
final process which is going to be in place for future VPP deals done through 
the Brazo's Funding Vehicle.  This process has evolved quite a bit since our 
original meetings with Tim Proffitt.  In light of how busy the new year has 
become, it is important that Gas Structuring help facilitate the deals along 
and not slow the process down due to lack of information.


Thanks

California=01,s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last seve=
ral=20
months.  Unfortunately, this debate has generated more heat than light.  We=
=20
want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.=
 =20
Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation=
=20
and our position on California energy issues.

What happened in California

The source of California=01,s current problem is as straightforward as supp=
ly=20
and demand.  California=01,s economy grew 29 percent since 1998.  This incr=
eased=20
the demand for electricity by 24 percent.  At the same time, regulatory=20
restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state.  So=
=20
demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added.  The resul=
t,=20
predictably, is a shortage.  This summer, peak capacity will be about 10=20
percent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state.

In addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related=
=20
factors that led to the current crisis.  First, the state=01,s regulations=
=20
forced all sales and purchases into the spot market.  The spot market for=
=20
power is extraordinarily volatile.  The way firms behave in a free market=
=20
when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo=
ng=20
term, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.  I=
n=20
California, state regulation prevented this strategy.  This would be the=20
equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th=
e=20
most volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine=20
while the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawat=
t=20
was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price.

Second, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remain=
ed=20
in effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep=20
competition out.  This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa=
le=20
prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the=20
regulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt.

In short, California=01,s problems were caused by regulation, not deregulat=
ion. =20
Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new=
=20
generation from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile=
=20
spot prices.

At the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned=
=20
the state=01,s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, w=
hich,=20
if adopted, would have averted the current crisis.

Enron=01,s Role

Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f=
ix=20
the problem.  Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the=20
politicians and the media.  Here are the facts:

? Other than a small amount of wind power, Enron is not a generator in the=
=20
state of California.  Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the=
=20
same market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a=20
market maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.  We ar=
e=20
interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc=
ts=20
for our customers.
? As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from=
=20
the problems the states=01, utilities, and their customers, now face.  We=
=20
protected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility.

You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply=20
power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on=
=20
the open market.  Early reports mischaracterized this as a =01&turnback=018=
 of our=20
customers to the utilities.  Here are the facts:

? As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California=20
market, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct=
ly=20
from the utilities.  This decision reduced EES=01,s market price risk by=20
allowing EES to access lower utility rates.
? EES did not terminate any customer contracts, and our customers continue =
to=20
receive the financial benefits of their contract prices.
? EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them=
=20
with other energy-related products and services, including assistance in=20
reducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times.

Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its=
=20
crisis; Enron continues to sign up customers in the state; and Enron=20
continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western=
=20
power markets.  Enron=01,s primary business is managing risk for our custom=
ers=20
with solutions customized to meet their needs.  There has never been more=
=20
demand for our products and services.

The Solution

The solution to California=01,s crisis is also straightforward.  In summary=
, the=20
state must increase supply, reduce demand, reduce reliance on the spot mark=
et=20
and shore up the financial stability of the state=01,s utilities.

Increasing Supply

California=01,s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing=
=20
short of Byzantine.  Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les=
s=20
than a year.  In California, it often takes 5 to 7 years.  California simpl=
y=20
must streamline this process.  Ironically, while many of the regulations=20
generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality, the=
=20
regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and=20
displacing current plants, which emit 40 times as much NOx.  California can=
=20
have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new=20
facilities.

Reducing Demand

Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand. =
=20
They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is.  An open retail=
=20
market would trigger demand responses, which would balance supply and deman=
d=20
at lower prices than today.  California should fully open its retail market=
.

Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market

In a truly deregulated market, customers would protect themselves from=20
volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer=
=20
term, fixed-price basis.  The state has instead left procurement in the han=
ds=20
of the utilities, which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market=
. =20
Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the=
ir=20
price risk.

Restoring the Financial Integrity of the State=01,s Institutions

The utilities in California are not paying their bills.  This has led to=20
greater uncertainty in the market, higher costs, and reduced flexibility to=
=20
arrive at lasting solutions.  California must permit its utilities to recov=
er=20
their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and=
=20
distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is=
=20
needed.

Just as important as doing these things, the state must avoid policies that=
,=20
while politically attractive, do not fix the problem or even make matters=
=20
worse.  Price caps have been proposed.  They don=01,t work; have never work=
ed;=20
and they will not work here.  Price caps succeed only in creating shortages=
,=20
which then have to be allocated among competing users.  Imagine how=20
ineffectively the government would be in determining, for example, whether =
it=20
is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall=
ey=20
or Silicon Valley.  Price caps are a surefire way to make the current=20
shortage worse.

The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in=20
California.  There is no reason to believe, and every reason to doubt, that=
=20
the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in,=20
constructing, operating and maintaining assets.  This will also result in=
=20
California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power=20
generation -- which the private sector can do -- instead of education, road=
s=20
and other public goods -- which the private sector cannot do.

As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t=
he=20
crisis from the media, it=01,s important for you to know this:  We at Enron=
 will=20
continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real=20
solutions to the state.

Sandy, we are still finalizing the contract and expected volumes with Cabot 
Oil & Gas Marketing Corporation for the two Terrebonne Parish deals 
referenced above, but we expect to enter into a long term deal prior to the 
end of December.  Would you please re-confirm that the notional pricing set 
forth in your 11/13/2000 memo for the two Cabot Terrebonne Parish deals is 
still valid for 5 years firm out of January 2001 for 80% of the volumes cited 
in my original request .  Thanks.

Dear John,
There should be links on our website also to Vitra, Moroso and Fiam. They
will be able to give you details of distributors/stockists in your area.
Please contact me again if you are unable to find the info you need - we
would then need to know your location in the US.

Dear Sir or Madam:

I just fell in love with Ron Arad's designs.  I have always been a fan, but
I just now went to your website.  Truly incredible.  I am a collector of
design objects and I am very interested in Ron Arad.  Are there any
distributors of his products in the US (other than Alessi and Kartell)?  I
am mainly interested in the mass produced  items and in particular the
furniture.

Thank you for your time and consideration and keep up the good work.

Subject: RE: Coast chair



Thank you very much for your email.  One thing I would like to let you guys
know.  I called the company in California (Leif Petersen).  They gave me
the company that carries Magis here in Houston.  The name of the company is
Cantoni.  They are not what I would call a good furniture design store.
They carry alot of very cheesy (sorry for lack of better words) Italian
furniture.  I called them to inquire about the Coast chair.  They said that
they carry Magis furniture and the time for ordering would be approximately
3 months.  No big deal, however, when I asked about price, they would not
answer that over the phone.  They wanted me to come into the store so that
they could consult me.  I don't think I need to be consulted on design.  I
know what I want and all I was using them for was to order.  They said it
was store policy not to quote prices over the phone because of competition.
Competition is what the whole world is all about.  I will not be buying
anything from them anytime soon.  I called Totemdesign and they are finding
all the information out for me.  Totem is so great.  They have helped me
with many things.  I just bought an Orgone chair that I expect to receive
in about a week.

Sorry for the rambling on, I guess what I was getting at is that if you
have any say so about who carries Marc's designs, I don't think that
Cantoni is worthy.  Just take that for what it is worth.

Thank you for your time and consideration and I look forward to talking to
you in the future.  Please keep me informed about anything exciting going
on with Marc's designs or any new products coming out.  I am very excited.

Sincerely,

John Griffith

When you have a few minutes, please take a look at the request below.  My 
thoughts are this product is not hedgable.  I'm looking for another opinion 
and I figure you've probably seen everything under the sun.  

I don't need a response today but this week would be great.  Thanks

the Basis as a percentage of the NYMEX Settle instead of a traditional 
location basis.   Please review.  

Can the Basis be hedged since it is based on the NYMEX Settle instead of a 
traditional location basis?

1)  Is this deal done?  No, not yet.  Cabot is reviewing our new Enfolio long 
term contract and has suggested some minor modifications.  Also, this new 
long term contract form is awaiting final Legal Department approval - we 
expect this imminently.  Finally, our reservoir engineers are scheduled to 
visit Cabot's offices on 12/5/2000 to review their downhole data - we will 
not enter into a long term contract until a full reserve review has been 
completed.  
2)  What is the firm quantity?   The quantitiy should be fixed.  For 
December, the firm quantity on Tennessee is 11,280 Mmbtu/d, or 80% of the 
14,100 Mmbtu/d we expect to flow.  The firm quantity on Transco is 14,720 
Mmbtu/d, or 80% of the 18,400 Mmbtu/d we expect to flow.  We intend to keep 
the desk whole on these firm quantities.
3)  Who is communcating with Cabot from a logisitics/volume management point 
of view?  We expect to communicate with Cabot from a logistics/volume 
management point of view. 
4)  Why are we nominating ( instead of ENA Upstream) and which group is 
responsible for balancing on Tenn and Transco?  We intend to do whatever is 
necessary to get the gas to pipeline pooling points and thereupon turn it 
over to each Desk's logistics team.  We do not see the need to duplicate our 
existing logistics function.

Victor,

Are you guys nominating/confirming this gas on Tennessee Passkey and Transco 
Transit for December or are we?  We expect that as the deals are entered into 
Sitara, you will be asked to nominate and confirm this gas.

Are there going to be two sets of tickets for each deal (one for the firm 
volume and one for the swing)?  We'll need those deal numbers when you have 
them..  Actually, we've prepared 3 deal tickets for each deal.  One ticket is 
for the 80% firm purchase (first of the month index pricing) from Cabot by 
Upstream, the second ticket is for the 20% spot purchase (gas daily pricing) 
from Cabot by Upstream and the third ticket is the desk-to-desk transaction 
in which Upstream sells the 80% firm volume to the East Desk - this is the 
ticket which will generate origination to the Upstream Desk, if applicable.
   
Are you scheduling this internally in Unify or are we?  You are.

Sandy,

Attached are the tickets we intend to submit to document the two (2) deals 
with Cabot for December.  Once you and John have had an opportunity to review 
these tickets, Melissa and I would like to come down and walk them through 
the system.  Thanks.

Cabot has agreed to do the December deals at index minus $0.01 for 80% of 
their volume and gas daily minus $0.01 for the remaining 20% of their 
volume.  We expect that they will soon execute the long term paper providing 
for index minus $0.005 for the 80% firm traunch and gas daily minus $0.005 
for the 20% spot traunch; a set of new long term tickets will be prepared and 
submitted upon execution of the long term paper.

If this mechanism of documenting our deals works, we intend to submit all 
future deals in a similar manner.

harassment prevention training soon.  This training is mandatory for all 
ENRON employees.

Dear Ken,

I spoke to Michcon regarding their gas city gates.

They have over 100 connection points in the state. The nearest ones to
Gibraltar (although they will transport it from anywhere because the gas
loses its identity when it is mixed with other gas
already in the pipes) are:

Panhandle.... River Rouge
ANR...........Willow Run
Great Lakes Transmission....Belle River

I am still arranging to get the Pickling invoices. How many months do you
need?

Regards

Tony Wilson

I left a voicemail, but I'll write an email as well.  Our ECS meeting should 
be over by 2:30 or so, so a 3:00 meeting would be great.  I would have to 
leave at 3:45 to make my 4:00 meeting, but I don't think it should take that 
long, right?

Thanks John,

Andrew

I had a good conversation with Dave Wohlfarth of PSE&G yesterday concerning 
the proposed LOI.  He had received comments back  from his Attorney (Ken 
Caratta) and had 2 issues he needed to circle back with him on.  These issues 
concern the process of approvals by PSEG and ENA of the final Order that 
would come from the NJ BPU relating to the transfer of assets over to their 
unregulated affiliate "Newco".   Ken is out of the office today but will be 
back in Monday.  Dave's target is to get us their comments late on Monday.  
He would also like to have a conference call by mid-week to work through the 
document with the expectation to have it signed by the end of the week.  We 
need to be ready to update our analysis once we receive their revisions to 
the LOI.

Concerning the Filing - a Pre-Hearning Conference has been noticed and  
scheduled with the Office of Administrative Law Judge for December 19th.  It 
is anticipated that the procedual schedule for comments and hearings will be 
set at that time.  Dave would like to finish the LOI prior to the hearing.  
We will be participating and intervening in the hearings.

Good news on the Genco side of PSE&G - The NJ Supreme Court ruled 4 to 1 to 
approve the transfer of the generation assets over to PSEG Power LLC  and the 
approximate $ 3 Billion securitization of  "stranded costs" on the assets.  
Getting this approve has been important to PSE&G and should help with 
precedent on the eventual transfer of the gas assets.

Please give me a call if you have any questions.

Mike and Frank,

Attached are the quotes for options based on your previous email.  Please 
look over the time periods, volumes and strikes.  These quotes are indicitive 
based on todays curves.  Let me know if we need to firm up these numbers 
tomorrow.  I do have some questions/concerns relating to this deal before 
this can be done however, they are:

  1)  Should the volume be a baseload volume of 10,000/day?
  2)  How are you buying your coal for the plant (i.e. fixed, index...)?
  3)  What is the correlation of the SRAC and the Socal Border price 
(especially during this time of high volatility)?
  4)  Has there been a calculation of the change in Socal Border vs. the 
change in the SRAC to calculate the proper volume to hedge (basically a   
delta calculation)?

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.  My phone number is 
(713) 853-6247.  Thanks.

John

John,
There is a re-launch of the Coast chair at the Milan Fair. It is by Magis.
This version is plastic blow-moulded ( not the original wood chair for the
Coast Restaurant)

Some of the originals recently came up for auction.

Patsy,

I just talked to Totemdesign and they said that Magis doesn't produce the
Coast chair.  He thought that it was only produced for a restaurant, is
that true?  If not, who produces the Coast chair.

Thanks for your time.

Sincerely,

John Griffith

We will be releasing new version of the Stack Manager and the EnronOnline=
=20
website tonight . The following are the changes

1. Changes to Stack Manager:

1.1 Changes to toolbar icons:
To facilitate further development of the system, it has been found necessar=
y=20
to change the toolbar icons at the top of the Stack  Manager. The attached=
=20
file shows the old icon and its new replacement. Next to each image below i=
s=20
the description of the function that is executed as well as the short cut k=
ey=20
that is mapped to the same function:



1.2 New Functionality - Auto Suspend
The Auto Suspend function allows traders to set an absolute price change fr=
om=20
a price level at which you would like the system to automatically suspend a=
=20
specific product. This function is useful if your products use automatic=20
price resets.

To activate this feature:
1. Select a product and click on Product Properties
2. Check the Enable box
3. Enter the Price Check and Suspend at +/- values
4. Click Update
Example: a trader Enables Auto Suspend and selects a $35.00 Price Check and=
 a=20
suspension level of +/- $5.00: The system will suspend the product when the=
=20
mid price is above  $40.00 or below $30.00

You will need to enter a new Price Check or disable the Auto Suspend functi=
on=20
to reactivate this Product if the Auto Suspend is triggered. =20
Please note the system checks for any products that need to be suspended on=
ce=20
a minute.


2. Changes to EnronOnline Website
 (These changes will be rolled out in phases over the next week and will be=
=20
available to all customers only by Friday 5/4/01)

The following enhancements have been made to the EnronOnline Website:

2.1 Today=01,s Transactions

Float Window:  In order to float the window, right click on the Today=01,s=
=20
Transactions section, click on the Float Window option.

Sort Ordering: Click on the column heading to change the sort order.=20

Linked Transactions: You can display the linked Transactions in an expanded=
=20
or collapsed view. To do so, right click in the Transaction display area an=
d=20
select full Expand or Full Collapse.

2.2 Submission Box

The submission box has been modified in order to show a space between each=
=20
set of =01&zeros=018 for the volume the customer wants to sell/buy.

Merchant...] and St. Mary's, who is the person responsible for making sure 
that the ENA contracts group makes the name change [assignment], and that 
everything in ENA's internal system - Sitara gets changed accordingly?  And 
also to make sure that these deals do not get duplicated?

Hey Colleen, how are thing going?  I haven't talked to you in a while. 

I was trying to tie out a transportation deal in the books with my transport 
model.  I found that the transportation spreadsheet that the books are being 
closed out with was valuing extrinsic value over what my model valued it.  I 
reconciled the differences and the main difference was due to the blending of 
the volatilities.  I brought this problem up back in October of this year.  
Do you remember?   When I talked to Greg Couch today, those changes were not 
made.  I think that it is an issue with all the transportation deals.   

The problem is related to the number of days that is used to weight the 
daily/omicron volatility.  Basically, transportation is a daily spread option 
and if you look at a month like November for instance, you have 30 different 
daily options.  If you were to look at the number of days that the 
daily/omicron volatility should be used you would have the first option with 
1 day of daily vol, the second with 2 days of daily vol, the third with 3 
days of daily vol and so on and so on.  The average number of days that 
should be used to weight the daily/omicron volatility is 15 or the number of 
days in each particular month divided by 2.  The transportation spreadsheet 
is weighting that volatility with the total number of days in the month.  
This usually overstates the extrinsic value since that the daily/omicron 
volatility is usually higher than the monthly volatility.  

Please let me know what you would like me to do.  I have a call into Zimin to 
make sure that my logic is correct.  Thanks.

George,

Per Scott Neal, the non firm volumes should be handled day ahead with the 
desk.  He wants to know the volume day ahead and he will give you a quote on 
a day ahead basis, not on a set gas daily number for the month.  Please call 
with any questions or concerns.  Thanks.

John

Michael - I understand we are paying the additional $440,220 that was sent 
last Friday back this week.  Can you let me know what day this will need to 
go out so we can have Treasury reserve the funds?  Thanks.

The lovely and talented Beth Secor, the funny funny Beth Secor, the Beth
Secor we all know and love so much, is moving to Baltimore, MD during
the first week of the New Year. I just don't know how the good part of
Texas will survive without her. Just this year Beth won some prize for
her badass painting at the Lawndale Big Show, and she should've won some
other prize for being so damn funny over the years. So here's the thing:

On Thursday, Dec 21, 7:30 - 9pm at DiverseWorks, Beth is doing her Final
Reading. Tickets are $5 and I think all proceeds go to helping Beth
move. Also, she'll  unload a bunch of her old work from the 80's and
early 90's for $10 -$50 that
night. So go check it out. Man, to get a Beth for $50- that's CRAZY! $10
is just insane.

Seriously, Beth is great. Go see her read her hilarious stuff. Go get a
painting. I SO MUCH wish I could go, but I'll be at work. Oh, here's a
link to a bit of her writing:
http://www.creativealliance.org/peekreview/ Go there and click on
Houston Diary.

Ok. Peace. Love. Al Gore.

Mary Lynne/John,

Just wanted to follow up on my earlier e-mail.  I re-ran my calculation for 
the Enron Cost of Funds/Deal Cost versus Libor.  The following reconciles 
this calculation:

 Difference between Libor and ENE Cost of Funds    $5,131,161
 Difference between ENE Cost of Funds and Deal Spread (87.5 bps)  $2,491,673

 Total Difference between Deal and Libor     $7,622,834

Sorry for the mistake and again, please let me know if there are any 
questions. Thanks.

Mike

Mary Lynne,

Just wanted to updated you on the current prepay that is scheduled to close 
next thursday (28th) with Chase and Fleet.  The prepay is anticipated as 
follows:

Total Funds      $330,000,000
Financing Expenses:
 Upfront to Banks $2,582,500
 Surety Bonds  $2,175,670
  Total Fees         $4,758,170

Anticipated Cash Flow    $325,241,830

The anticipated reserve related to ENE cost of funds versus the prepay is  
estimated to be ($130,501) while the timing differential between delivery 
date and settlement date (55 days) is estimated to be ($2,949,879).  Please 
let me know if you have any questions or need any additional information.  
Thanks again for your help.

Michael

John--
I think you're doing the right thing by first getting with Zimin to make sure 
he agrees and will sign off on this change.  Next, before we just change this 
in the model, I will want Greg to run "parallel" valuations to see what the 
impact will be on each person's book.  Then, we will get with the traders and 
see how they want to implement it.  Since the book runners are using the 
correlation to basically make the books have what they believe is a market 
value for capacity, I would assume that they may want to change correlation 
to offset the value change in the volatility; however, that decision will be 
left to each book runner.  

Let me know what you hear back from Zimin.

Hey Colleen, how are thing going?  I haven't talked to you in a while. 

I was trying to tie out a transportation deal in the books with my transport 
model.  I found that the transportation spreadsheet that the books are being 
closed out with was valuing extrinsic value over what my model valued it.  I 
reconciled the differences and the main difference was due to the blending of 
the volatilities.  I brought this problem up back in October of this year.  
Do you remember?   When I talked to Greg Couch today, those changes were not 
made.  I think that it is an issue with all the transportation deals.   

The problem is related to the number of days that is used to weight the 
daily/omicron volatility.  Basically, transportation is a daily spread option 
and if you look at a month like November for instance, you have 30 different 
daily options.  If you were to look at the number of days that the 
daily/omicron volatility should be used you would have the first option with 
1 day of daily vol, the second with 2 days of daily vol, the third with 3 
days of daily vol and so on and so on.  The average number of days that 
should be used to weight the daily/omicron volatility is 15 or the number of 
days in each particular month divided by 2.  The transportation spreadsheet 
is weighting that volatility with the total number of days in the month.  
This usually overstates the extrinsic value since that the daily/omicron 
volatility is usually higher than the monthly volatility.  

Please let me know what you would like me to do.  I have a call into Zimin to 
make sure that my logic is correct.  Thanks.

John, Mike

I work for the London Research team and am looking at 
some option pricing problems for the UK gas desk.
Dave Redmond the options trader told me that you had done 
some fundamental research regarding 
the gas implied volatility smiles and may be able to help.

I would be grateful if you tell me 
what you have done or suggest 
someone else that I could ask.

Jeff,

Following my discussion with Bob Hall earlier today, we've changed the two 
desk-to-desk tickets to reflect the full 100% volume - 14,100 Mmbtu/d on 
Tennessee and 18,400 Mmbtu/d on Transco.  A set of six tickets - 3 for each 
deal - is attached.   Please enter these tickets into Tagg and Sitara, or 
advise me if you require additional documentation.  Thanks.

1)  Is this deal done?  No, not yet.  Cabot is reviewing our new Enfolio long 
term contract and has suggested some minor modifications.  Also, this new 
long term contract form is awaiting final Legal Department approval - we 
expect this imminently.  Finally, our reservoir engineers are scheduled to 
visit Cabot's offices on 12/5/2000 to review their downhole data - we will 
not enter into a long term contract until a full reserve review has been 
completed.  
2)  What is the firm quantity?   The quantitiy should be fixed.  For 
December, the firm quantity on Tennessee is 11,280 Mmbtu/d, or 80% of the 
14,100 Mmbtu/d we expect to flow.  The firm quantity on Transco is 14,720 
Mmbtu/d, or 80% of the 18,400 Mmbtu/d we expect to flow.  We intend to keep 
the desk whole on these firm quantities.
3)  Who is communcating with Cabot from a logisitics/volume management point 
of view?  We expect to communicate with Cabot from a logistics/volume 
management point of view. 
4)  Why are we nominating ( instead of ENA Upstream) and which group is 
responsible for balancing on Tenn and Transco?  We intend to do whatever is 
necessary to get the gas to pipeline pooling points and thereupon turn it 
over to each Desk's logistics team.  We do not see the need to duplicate our 
existing logistics function.

Victor,

Are you guys nominating/confirming this gas on Tennessee Passkey and Transco 
Transit for December or are we?  We expect that as the deals are entered into 
Sitara, you will be asked to nominate and confirm this gas.

Are there going to be two sets of tickets for each deal (one for the firm 
volume and one for the swing)?  We'll need those deal numbers when you have 
them..  Actually, we've prepared 3 deal tickets for each deal.  One ticket is 
for the 80% firm purchase (first of the month index pricing) from Cabot by 
Upstream, the second ticket is for the 20% spot purchase (gas daily pricing) 
from Cabot by Upstream and the third ticket is the desk-to-desk transaction 
in which Upstream sells the 80% firm volume to the East Desk - this is the 
ticket which will generate origination to the Upstream Desk, if applicable.
   
Are you scheduling this internally in Unify or are we?  You are.

Sandy,

Attached are the tickets we intend to submit to document the two (2) deals 
with Cabot for December.  Once you and John have had an opportunity to review 
these tickets, Melissa and I would like to come down and walk them through 
the system.  Thanks.

Cabot has agreed to do the December deals at index minus $0.01 for 80% of 
their volume and gas daily minus $0.01 for the remaining 20% of their 
volume.  We expect that they will soon execute the long term paper providing 
for index minus $0.005 for the 80% firm traunch and gas daily minus $0.005 
for the 20% spot traunch; a set of new long term tickets will be prepared and 
submitted upon execution of the long term paper.

If this mechanism of documenting our deals works, we intend to submit all 
future deals in a similar manner.

Any word on this?  I still think that if Stoneville is preparing a confirm 
(even with the forward sale) it would make sense for us to.  Let me know and

Looks like no confirm since only physical (which seems odd that Stoneville 
sent us a confirm).  I think we should probably be consistent with Mahonia.  
Let me know your thoughts.  Thanks again for all your help.

Mike, there really isn't a confirm with Mahonia, the FSA (forward sale 
agreement) defines our delivery obligation.  When John books that, it should 
then go to the physical desk to be booked into Sitara.  If you have trouble, 
call Brad McKay and he'll give you a contact to book the delivery 
obligation.  Remind him of the fixed price purchase obligation when he books 
it so that he doesn't think he's got an open short to play with.

In our deals the financial swap confirm was written by Chase.  I don't think 
there was ever a formal confirm on the floating physical purchase.

Quick question - did you prepare the confirm between ENA and Mahonia?  We 
were having the confirm people do that and they were playing stupid.  I am 
still thinking about your earning game - the only issue I can think of is 
selling a certain part of the fiber (i.e., that represents a certain physical 
asset) where gas is more fungible.  However, that can be gotten around.  
Enjoy and thanks.

I need to reprice Stagecoach's gas swap.  The location is TGP Zone 5.  I 've 
also attached the monthly MMBtus for one year. 

Please let me know if you need me to provide additional information for 
repricing gas for this deal.  Thanks again.

When the existing VPP's get syndicated into Brazos later this week, then they 
will be between Brazos [not Entrada] and Crescendo, and Brazos [not ECT 
Merchant...] and St. Mary's, who is the person responsible for making sure 
that the ENA contracts group makes the name change [assignment], and that 
everything in ENA's internal system - Sitara gets changed accordingly?  And 
also to make sure that these deals do not get duplicated?

Ned, the table below shows indicative values for the subject transaction.



The assumptions used to derive these values are as follows:
ES owns 3.9 Bcf of gas in storage at a WACOG of $2.30/MMBtu.
The gas will be withdrawn at a rate of 0.487 Bcf/month starting in Jun'02.
In the "Full Hedge" scenario we sell futures to match the withdrawal rate 
(487,000/month in Jun'02 through Dec'02 and 468,000 in Jan'03.)
In the "Partial Hedge" scenario we sell futures at an 80% ratio to the Full 
Hedge scenario.
In the "w/o Hedge" scenario the mark would get adjusted continually with 
market price movement.  Also, the average monthly volatility and expected 
high/low value is simply to demonstrate a range of possible outcomes.  As 
these months move closer to prompt their volatility could (and probably will) 
increase resulting in larger than stated (but currently unknown) swings in 
value.  (Ned, as we discussed, I simply adjusted the transaction value by the 
volatility %.  This methodology may need more work.)
In the "Options" scenario, a significant amount of the transaction value 
would be consumed buying [ATM] calls.  Also, I think selling futures and 
buying calls is the same as buying puts (synthetic option) so we should ask, 
would we buy puts as part of the "hedge?" 

Let me know if you need more information.

Louis

Dave,

To follow up on our conversation about the Pipe Option Book, Errol will 
provide post id's for Friday's COB
to calc the pipe options book with the skew table. As I asked on the phone 
please provide two calcs, one calc
for the pipe options deals with and with out skew and another calc with the 
NYMEX options deals with and without skew.

In addition to this, please recalc  1078960 & 1078963 for the ngpropt book.  
These calcs are for puts and for calls for COB 3-23.

If you have any questions please contact me at 3-9257 with any questions

Joan,

The BOA ticket was established by John Griffith.

Two deal tickets are necessary for St. Mary's in order to segregate that 
portion of the excess volumes on which a firm delivery guarantee to the East 
Desk was made and origination was taken from that portion of the excess

George,

There should not be a deal tic for BOA [55941].  The Brazos tic #541136 has 
100% of the VPP vols, which is correct.  The other tic should not exist.  I 
am not sure if you put this in, or if John Griffith did this when the name 
change from St. Mary's to Brazos took place.  Please let me know what I need 
to do in order to get this removed/corrected. 

Also, when things slow down, we need to discuss the 2 deal tics [firm and 
spot].  Per the contract with Preston, there s/b only one tic - all the gas 
at IF TGT + 0.0025.

thanks.

spreadsheet showing the necessary combination of digitals and europenas to 
make it happen. We will be glad to assist you pricing that.

When you have a few minutes, please take a look at the request below.  My 
thoughts are this product is not hedgable.  I'm looking for another opinion 
and I figure you've probably seen everything under the sun.  

I don't need a response today but this week would be great.  Thanks

Phillips Production would like to know if it is possible to do a Financial 
Hedge for both the NYMEX Settle and Basis.  The attached scheudle calculates 
the Basis as a percentage of the NYMEX Settle instead of a traditional 
location basis.   Please review.  

Can the Basis be hedged since it is based on the NYMEX Settle instead of a 
traditional location basis?

Volume:  5,000 - 7,000 per day.
Period is :  Apr01 - Oct01

John,

I assume that you are working Marsha's values into our analysis of Southern 
Co.'s rate from Zone .  The Southern Co./Sonat transportation contract has 
the following discount rate.  

 Term     Rate
 June 2004 - May 2007   .1973
 June 2007- May 2012   .2219 plus GDP not to exceed 3% in any year
 June 2012 - May 2017   GDP w/no cap not to exceed max rate of $.2663

Max Rate from Zone 1 to 2 is $8.10 or $.2663 which would be the absolute cap 
unless Sonat raised rates during the term of the Southern Co/Sonat contract.

When are we going to meet tomorrow to go over this?  I'm open in the morning 
if ok with you and Breese.

John:
I think I like the approach you took in your first spreadsheet. Note that the 
spread option model takes rates expressed as continious rates. That is not 
consistent with the rates we have on our AA curves.
I suggest you change to your original valuation.
Thanks

Amendments to NYMEX End of Week Post-Close Trading Session Rule

DATE:
May 4, 2001
===========================================================

Please be advised that beginning on Friday, May 11, 2001, a number of
changes to the NYMEX End of Week post-close trading session rule that were
recently approved by the Board will become effective.

Specifically, beginning on Friday, May 11, 2001 and continuing for
subsequent Friday post-close sessions (and post-close sessions the day
before a mid-week Exchange holiday) the following changes will be in
effect:

(1)  Contract months eligible for trading in these sessions will be
expanded from the first four to the first 12 consecutive listed contract
months.

(2)  The sessions will be 5 minutes in duration.

(3)  The trading range for these sessions will be expanded by adding the
following ticks above (below) the
daily high (low) for the applicable contract month (provided that this
expanded trading range does not violate the maximum permissible price
fluctuation limits then in effect):

Crude Oil      20 ticks
Heating Oil         50 ticks
Unleaded Gas        50 ticks
Natural Gas         50 ticks

If you have any questions concerning these changes, please contact George

Rule 6.57A.     END OF WEEK TRADING SESSION

On the last trading day of the calendar week, and, in any week when an
Exchange holiday falls on a Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday on the trading
day preceding such midweek Exchange holiday, there shall be no post-close
trading session provided on the trading floor pursuant to Rule 6.57.
Instead, on such dates, an end of week trading session (the "End of Week
Session'') shall commence on the trading floor pursuant to this rule and
subsequent to the close.  Except as otherwise provided by the President or
the President's designee for a particular trade date, such End of Week
Session shall commence twenty (20) minutes after the close of trading in
all futures contracts and shall continue for a period of [ten (10)]  * five
(5) * minutes in all energy and metals futures contracts, subject to the
following conditions:

(A) Trading during the End of Week Session shall be limited to the first
[four] * twelve * listed delivery months;

(B) Trades occurring during the End of Week Session for a particular
contract month of a futures contract shall be executed openly and
competitively at a price within the daily trading range of the applicable
contract month for that futures contract * and as further expanded above
the daily high and below the daily low only for the contracts listed below
provided however that no such expanded trading range may exceed the price
fluctuation limits in effect for the applicable contract as of the end of
the RTH session:

Contract                 Additional Ticks

Crude Oil                20 ticks
Natural Gas                   50 ticks
Unleaded Gasoline             50 ticks
Heating Oil                   50 ticks *

(C) During the End of Week Session, Floor Members, Floor Brokers and their
customers may participate in the same manner as trading occurring during
the regular RTH session, except that any order submitted during the RTH
session, including but not limited to resting orders such as stop orders,
limit orders and good until cancelled (GTC) orders, will be deemed to have
expired as of the end of RTH for purposes of this End of Week Session.
Accordingly, in the event that a market participant with such an expired
order seeks to participate in the End of Week Session, a new order must be
submitted.

(D) Prices for trades executed during the End of Week Session shall  be
reported on public ticker services;

(E) Current market prices and trades executed during the End of Week
Session shall not be considered in determining any settlement price; and

(F) Floor Members executing trades during the End of Week Session shall
mark a line across their trading cards prior to the entry of an End of Week
Session trade.

The attached note lists conditions that can be used to verify that a given 
vol skew curve does not generate arbitrage opportunities in a strip of option 
prices.

If you have questions or want to discuss implementation, please give me a 
call.
