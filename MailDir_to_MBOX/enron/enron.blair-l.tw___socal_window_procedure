Starting on the timely process for gas day of July 28th forward. We will now start using the cut code of PRD when we allocate Socal based on there window, whether above or below the 750,000 firm capacity. The only time that you will use the cut code CCD, is when the outage is truly related to TW. There will be more procedure to follow, regarding the data request from FERC. If you have questions or concerns, please ask Terry Kowalke, Darrell Schoolcraft, or Lynn Blair. Your assistance is greatly appreciated.

            We met with SoCal today to discuss the changes SoCal is making for
	November 1.  Here is a high level recap in relation to impacts on TW:

	1.  SoCal will NOT set the capacity at needles lower than 750 unless
	     they have operational problems. And they will maintain 750 for a gas 
	     day (during all cycles).  (Good news for TW)

	2.  SoCal may set a capacity higher than 750.  If they do, they will
	     maintain that capacity for a gas day (during all cycles), unless there
	     are specific operational problems. (Good news for TW)
	   
	4.  SoCal will have the option to call OFO's at the beginning of each cycle
	     for the gas day, which could cause a confirmation reduction.  Today they
	     only call an OFO before the gas day begins.   Starting Nov. 1, they can 
	     call an OFO anytime before a GISB cycle, including Intraday 1 and 
	     Intraday 2 which are cycles in the gas day. (This will be a major impact
	     to SoCal's customers)

	5.  SoCal says the "windowing" is gone.  But, they are still giving us a
	     capacity and TW will continue to do the allocation if nominations
	     exceed their capacity.

	6.  SoCal can still reduce the scheduled volumes after an allocation.  This
	     would be due to SoCal's market not burning their schedule.  At that
	     time SoCal will confirm down to the market burn.

	Overall, our process does not change. If you have any questions, please
	let me know.  Thanks. Lynn

Yesterday SoCal filed the attached Advice Letter No. 2837-A to implement re=
vised operating procedures under Rule 30 of their tariff.  Basically this w=
ill formalize the October announcement to discontinue the Windowing process=
 calculations effective November 1, 2001.  Instead SoCal will utilize the M=
aximum Operating Capacity at each receipt point as the capacity limit.  Lyn=
n attended the referenced October meeting and subsequently distributed the =
handouts which are also part of the attachment, however if anyone needs add=
itional copies of  them please let me know. SoCal views this filing as an i=
nterim step towards approval of the GIR/Unbundling proceeding which will pr=
ovide for a system of firm tradable intrastate transmission rights.  I'll c=
ontinue to monitor the proceeding and will advise of any further actions ta=
ken by SoCal or their customers.  gh

Subject:	TW Allocations

When doing allocation process and we allocate points or groups on the Timely, Evening, or Non-Grid. 
We allocate with the capacities that are loaded from CAS.  When allocating points or groups that have
not previously been allocated on any of the previous cycles during ID-1 or ID-2 we need to use the flow rate calculation.
.
Example :  Allocations are as follows

The only point to be exempt from this method should be Socal Needles because of their window issue
Timely:        M/L Thoreau West System                1093.000  (capacity)
                   I/B Link                                             700.000  (capacity)
                   Laplata/Ignacio                                  500.000  (capacity)
                   Socal Needles                                   775.000  (Window)
Evening:      Same sequence 
Non-Grid:     Same sequence

ID-1or ID-2:  Same sequence shows up to be allocated.  
                   Since they were previously allocated on the earlier cycles we do not need to right mouse 
                   click and calculate flow and update capacity based on flow rate.  The only time we should 
                   have to calculate flow rate is when there is a new point or group shows up that has not been previously
                   allocated.                   
             
 The reason for the change is we have recieved more FERC data requests on capacities and scheduled volumes.
lets try this for a while and see how it is working.

FYI, here is an update from our meeting today,	

I did some checking to follow up on the Socal Window issue discussed in the meeting  today with our TMS IT team and Mary Draemer to find out the exact date when we implemented the EDI Socal Capacity Window. It was implemented on April 27, 2000. Socal began sending us the window volume via EDI at this time. Prior to this date, they faxed it to TW and the reps. would load that volume into the capacity system for the Socal point. Linda Ward thinks that we have the old fax documents saved in the file room.

Mary and I also called the EDI Hub team to find out how far back they store our EDI files. Currently the EDI Hub keep six months of data then the archive it. We could get to that date if needed. They would be a charge involved to pull archived data.

Wayne on the TMS team will also check to see if this information is replicated to adhoc (meaning we keep a complete history), or if it is not replicated (meaning we only keeps six months of data).

Please let me know if you need any other information.

Thanks Ramona
