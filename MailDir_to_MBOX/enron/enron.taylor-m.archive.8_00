Tana-

Further to my e-mail below, I note that the EOL US weather GTCs (where ENA is 
the counterparty) will  require modification for use with Japanese 
counterparties.  Presently, Brent Hendry is reviewing the draft EOL Japanese 
weather GTCs, which have been developed to utilize Enron Japan Corp. as the 
counterparty.

Cheers,

John

Tana-

For weather derivatives conducted by Enron North America with counterparties 
in Japan:

1.  There is a "relatively low risk" (quoting Baker & McKenzie) that such 
transactions will be considered gambling in Japan.  However, such risk is 
deemed to be even lower, when utilizing an offshore entity.  The risk has 
been determined to be sufficiently low to utilize Enron Japan Corp. as the 
Enron entity engaging in these transactions, therefore utilizing ENA should 
also be acceptable.

2.  I note, there will be foreign exchange reporting requirements for the 
Japanese counterparty to the transaction, both at the time the transaction is 
entered into and each time a payment is made (or netted).  There are no 
Japanese reporting requirements applicable to Enron North America.  Further, 
a default by the Japanese counterparty in compliance with its reporting 
requirements will not effect the enforceability of the transaction.

3.  I have copied Susan Musch on this correspondence, to obtain her input 
from the tax perspective.

Please let me know if you need anything further.

Cheers,

John

You both may already by aware of this, but the online team has contacted me 
and it is their desire to have the Japanese & Australian products also 
offered out of the U.S. by Enron North America.  They would continue to be 
offered by their current companies, "Enron Australia" and "EnronJapan", but 
they want the products sold "24 hours a day" and I guess to do this they 
would be offered also by Enron North America.  Do you see any legal issues 
from your side with a your Japanese or Australia products being offered by 
Enron North America too?

FYI --

Although Milbank has stated that "EOLympics" is probably permissible use, 
both Japanese and UK counsel have taken the position that this is still 
impermissible use of the term "Olympics".  

I know its not your first choice, Dave, but especially if we are going to 
promote the game on the home page -- which can be searched by any Olympic 
committee checking the Web for infringing use -- it would help to insulate us 
from detection, and possibly liability - to call the game "EOL-ympics" or 
even better from a detection standpoint "EOL-mpics".  

Mark -- Have we trademarked the term "EOL" and if so, in what countries?

		 Subject: olympic flier - and use of EOLympics


Further to my previous e-mail, I have now checked the flier with a
colleague in the IP department.

Providing Leslie's suggested amendments are made, the flier should not
expose Enron to passing off liability, since it is unlikely to confuse the
participants into thinking that the site is officially endorsed.  The best
thing to do, however, would be to include a disclaimer along the lines of
"the EnronOnline Competition has not been set up in collaboration with any
other parties {other than sports.rocket.com]."  Although common sense tells
us that  Enron should be able to use the word "olympic" in a disclaimer,
common sense does not necessarily seem to prevail with regards the use of
the word "olympic" in the UK, so the general wording  mentioned above should
be used!

My comment as to the possibility of fliers alerting the British Olympic
Association to the game still stands, particularly if they are to be paper
fliers.  If they are just to be e-mails, I guess the practical risk is less.
[I'm sure this has already been thought of, but if the flier is to be
e-mailed out, it can't be sent as Enrononline.com OlympicsMailer!]

On this point, am I still "up to date" in thinking that the proposal is
still to mention the word "olympic" in explaining the rules of teh game.

Regarding the use of EOLympics, from a UK point of view, this should
definately be avoided - as explained in an earlier e-mail of today, one of
the actions that "in particular" (i.e. definately!) infringes the Olympic
Symbol Protection Act is "offering or supplying services under a sign which
consists of or contains  the word olympic - it would be difficult to argue
that EOLympic does not contain the word "olympic"!

Thanks

Rachel

asked us to prepare.  Please note that we have made a number of factual 
assumptions about third party business that should be carefully reviewed by 
the EOL team.  Please let us know where we should go from here.  We should 
look to get this to the CFTC in draft as soon as possible.

Matt,

Thank you for your note.   I understand that the reporting requirement 
(According to the Korean Foreign Exchange Transaction Regulations("FETR"), a 
prior report to the Bank of Korea is required for the Derivative Transaction 
whose underlying assets are not financial products, i.e., "Commodity 
Derivative" by our own definition.) is a legal issue to be clarified and 
handled carefully.   However, speaking with the Bank of Korea and Hyundai 
Oil, I have the understanding that the Bank of Korea is willing to be 
flexible enough to accommodate instantaneous on-line derivative trading.  We 
might need official confirmation of this from the Bank of Korea, but I think 
that, working with the Bank of Korea, we could find a solution to this legal 
issue.   The following are some of the facts regarding the reporting 
requirement issue:

Although the Bank of Korea has the legal discretion to reject any report 
made, when I spoke with them a month ago, they emphasized their intention 
that they would not reject any report unless the transaction falls under 
either of the two categories stipulated in the Article 7-61 of the FETR (1. 
option premium more than 20%,  2. illegal  transaction).

Early this week, I talked with the Bank of Korea and Hyundai Oil, and both of 
them confirmed that since Apr. last year total 17 reports (from Hyundai Oil) 
have been filed with the Bank of Korea regarding Oil derivative 
transactions.   All 17 reports were submitted after the transactions had been 
made (ex post facto reporting), and many times Hyundai Oil put 2-3 
transactions together in one package (one-page filled out form per 
transaction) for reporting.   That's why Kim & Chang, the local law firm, got 
the information of 7-8 reports from the Bank of Korea.   

Both Hyundai Oil and the Bank of Korea said that the report is more like a 
notification and that the Bank of Korea just checks whether the transaction 
falls under either of the said 2 categories.  As far as a transaction does 
not fall under either of the 2 categories, neither the Bank of Korea nor 
Hyundai Oil  cares about the reporting.   The Bank of Korea does not insist 
on reviewing the report prior to the transaction and does not care even if 
the report is made even 1 or 2 weeks later.   That's why sometimes it takes a 
week for the Bank of Korea to return the report with its seal on it.   The 
Bank of Korea said that normally it takes less than one hour to review and 
place its seal on a one-page report. 

Regarding the Weather Derivatives, there is an issue whether Weather 
Derivatives will be classified as a Commodity Derivative or a Financial 
Derivative since Korea has no experience with such a product.   In the FETR, 
there is a general definition of the "Derivative Transaction".   No separate 
definition of the "Commodity Derivatives" or "Financial Derivatives".    
However, the FETR treats the Derivative Transaction whose underlying products 
are commodity products like grains and metals differently from the Derivative 
Transaction whose underlying products are financial products like interest 
payments and foreign currencies.   For convenience' sake, I would call the 
former the "Commodity Derivative" and the latter the "Financial 
Derivative".    The FETR stipulates that a prior report to the Bank of Korea 
is required for the Derivative Transaction whose underlying assets are not 
financial products (i.e., Commodity Derivative by our own definition) and 
that a prior approval of the Bank of Korea is required for the Derivative 
Transaction whose underlying assets are financial products (Financial 
Derivative by our definition) "among non-banking residents or between 
non-banking resident and non-resident".   No approval or report is required 
for the Financial Derivative Transaction if a banking institution is 
involved.    When I talked to the Int'l Finance Dept. of the Bank of Korea, 
which is responsible for the prior report and approval, they informally 
indicated that the underlying asset of the Weather Derivatives doesn't seem 
to be a financial product.  They said that they would need better 
understanding of the Weather Derivatives in order to determine that formally.

I hope that Matt's note and the above information are useful for all of you 
to understand the legal situation better.  Let's discuss and clarify these 
issues in our conference call.  Thanks.

Regards,
Jae-Moo

Subject: Re: EOL Korea  

Jae-Moo

On the section of Regulatory/Legal Environment, it may be useful to note:

1. There is no official rule or regulation that ex post facto reporting for 
Commodity Derivatives are acceptable to the Bank of Korea, although your and 
Korean external lawyer's (Kim & Chang) informal verbal enquiries with the 
Bank of Korea have suggested they have accepted some  7 or 8 reports since 
April last year (all from Hyundai Oil).

2. The Bank of Korea take up to two weeks to review the reports and, as Kim & 
Chang has advised, there remains a possibility that the Bank of Korea may 
reject the report, although they were not able to advise the grounds on which 
a report may be rejected.

3. Although, a foreign counterparty need not file a report or seek approval, 
the Korean counterparty must still do so for the benefit and interest of the 
foreign counterparty. Kim & Chang advised that where reporting or approval is 
required but is not made or obtained, the Korean counterparty would not be 
able to remit its payments under the transaction. This would clearly impact 
on the settlement of the transaction, in particular shorter term deals since 
reporting and approval may take several weeks. 

4. The Supreme Court of Korea has ruled that a foreign exchange authorization 
that was originally required should be obtained in order for a foreign party 
to execute any judgment against the Korean party and remit the proceeds.

Matt

Subject: EOL Korea

As many of you are aware, over the past few months we have been investigating 
whether or not it would make sense to seriously consider an EOL launch in 
Korea from a market, regulatory and legal perspective.  The primary interest 
has been on reviewing whether or not we could launch existing products in 
Korea (e.g., products already handled by Singapore EOL) as well as new 
products (e.g., Seoul weather). 

This initial work was directed primarily by the Korea team working within the 
APACHI group.  If a launch is to progress much further from this point, 
however, substantial attention by the EOL team would be required.  To 
facilitate this, the attached presentation summarizes our primary findings to 
date and some of our thoughts.  We would appreciate your taking a look at the 
attached document.

We would like to arrange a conference call for next Thursday (Aug. 31st) at 
6:00 pm by Houston time (Friday at 8:00 am by Tokyo time) to discuss the 
attached document and to solicit thoughts as to next steps.  Please let me 
know whether you will be able to join this call or, if you have a conflict, 
an alternative time.  Your participation will be greatly appreciated.  

Best regards,

Jae-Moo

the Enron Corp Guaranty would be in favour of whom, presumably NYMEX?

Subject: NYMEX

Don't know if you are aware but Enron are currently executing NYMEX trades 
through different 3rd party brokers, and it is now proposed that they put all 
their trades through MG (who are brokers to NYMEX).  In order to do this, the 
New York operation will need:

An unconditional Corp guarantee for $28 million.
In due course further capital, probably in the form of a sub loan.

In the short term, they will be able to migrate 1 or 2 of their existing 
brokerage accounts with just the guarantee.  Anne - can you run this by Ben?

FYI the guy running this out of NY is called Al Pennisi (212 715 5845).

This is currently being handled in Houston by Brent Price and David Dupre.

Mark
 
We asked for some advice from Baker Mackenzie as to an legal rquirements, 
consents permits which may be requred for us to trade aluminium in Japan 
using EOL. I also asked them to provde advice on what would be required if we 
were to trade metal derivatives. Whilst the advice is not complete I thought 
you might find it interesting.

Dear Marcus

Please see our draft advice attached.

Unfortunately, as may be apparent, it still needs some work and should 
therefore
be considered as a draft only. In view of the urgency however I thought it 
might
be useful to get it to you even in its present form.

We will finalize the advice by Friday at the latest, but if you have any
feedback in the meantime it would make for a more meaningful product.

Also, let me know if you wish us to proceed with the wording changes.

Best regards

Paul Davis

Dear Mark Taylor,

Please review the language below; it is a first attempt at making a non 
binding proposal to Noble Drilling.  Please return your approved language 
asap.

Thanks
John A. Peyton



Dear Mark Mey,

We appreciate your interest in our new dayrate financial products.  

For your consideration, we would like to indicatively propose a transaction 
in which Enron North America would purchase a Financial Call Option ("Cap") 
from Noble Drilling Corporation for the Calculation Period  April 1, 2001 
through June 30, 2001 for one Rig.  The Strike Price would be $65,000 per 
(Rig*Day) and the premium which we would pay to Noble Drilling Corporation 
(within Five Business Days of the Trade Date) would be US Dollars $200,000.

The Commodity Reference Price would be the arithmetic mean of the high and 
low Rig Day Rates for JU-300'-IC as published by Offshore Data Services, 
Inc., or its successor, in the last issue of Gulf of Mexico Weekly Rig 
Locator, or any successor publication, published during the applicable 
Calculation Period, on the page entitled "Gulf of Mexico Rig Utilization and 
Day Rates".  The Payment Date(s) would be the fifth (5th) Business Day 
following the date on which the Floating Price is determinable.

We have authority to enter into the above transaction and would be able to 
move quickly toward providing you with an executable contract.  Because the 
market for dayrates is highly volatile and because we may have made similar 
proposals to other counterparties, this indicative proposal is only good 
until August 31st, 2000.  We look forward to further discussions. 

This document contains indicative terms only and is not intended to create a 
binding or enforceable contract nor is it an offer or commitment to enter 
into any transaction.  All terms are subject to change until agreement as to 
a specific transaction has been reached.  ENA is not acting as a fiduciary or 
advisor and you should evaluate and understand the terms, conditions, and 
risks of all transactions in making your decisions with respect thereto.  The 
proposal described herein is subject to further review and approval by ENA 
and Counterparty and, among other matters, further review and approval of the 
board of directors of each party, and the negotiations, execution and 
delivery of definitive agreements containing all appropriate provisions, 
including those related to credit, limitations of damages and others.

Sincerely,

John A. Peyton

Brian,

I am sorry if you miss understand what I said but I would like to reiterate 
that I said IF customer had a master in place, that it would also cover 
EnronOnline but that would have to be verified by the legal group.  That is 
why I emailed and called both Mark Taylor and Leslie Hansen and had them get 
involved.    I had also explained all this to Tim Reyes with Alcoa.

It sounds like Mark has lead you in the right direction for assisting 
customer.

Kathy

Subject: Enron Online Access & ISDA's - ALCOA

To all,

One of our customers, ALCOA, has been registered on EOL for the OTC metal 
products, but is having problems accessing the trading site.

The problem stems from two areas:

1) When ALCOA accesses the trading site,  the prompt for Enron's terms and 
conditions comes up with a further prompt to agree or disagree to the 
conditions.  ALCOA's legal team has determined that they should not agree to 
the conditions because they have an existing ISDA agreement in place with MG 
Ltd.

2) ALCOA has talked to EOL's help desk (specifically Kathy Moore), who 
subsequently has determined (I assume with Enron legal) that the current ISDA 
in place with MG Ltd. is sufficient to begin trading EOL's OTC metal products.

In further discussions I had with Mark Taylor today,  he basically confirmed 
that the ISDA that's in place is valid for EOL's OTC metal products, but said 
that I should confirm with either Edmund Cooper or Justin Boyd in London for 
final confirmation of the legal questions, and Frank Davis for the EOL access.

In addition, Mark alluded to the probability that Enron legal/compliance does 
not have a listing and/or copies of ISDA's that MG Ltd. has in place with 
customers.  If you'd like, I can help facilitate that.  Please advise.

Could you confirm for me the following via telephone and/or e-mail:

1) That the current ISDA ALCOA has in place is valid for EOL's OTC metal 
product trading.

2) That their account can access the site without the term and conditions 
prompt.

Please contact me if you have any further questions or concerns.

Regards,
BEF

I am seeing more and more credit derivatives.  The trades originating in 
Houston are coming from Jeff Kinneman's bond/debt traders but are booked in 
the name of ECT Investments, Inc. or ENA.  I can't be certain if these are 
backed to EnronCredit.com Limited.  

In particular, there is a proposed total return bond trade with DLJ 
International Capital requiring ECT Investments to post collateral.  We have 
no master with this party.  Who in Houston credit  is looking at credit 
derivatives?

FYI, other credit deals seem to be transacted wtih Deutsche Bank and UBS AG.

Dear Ms Hong

Thank you for your memo dated 12 July 2000 on EnronOnline and our various
telephone discussions on the matter.

I had previously enquired on the consequences of not obtaining the relevant
approvals or filing the relevant report with the Bank of Korea. You advised in
your memo thatthe Korean counterparty would not be able to remit its payments
under the transaction and that the Supreme Court of Korea has ruled that 
foreign
exchange authorization must be obtained before a judgment can be executed
against a Korean party and the proceeds remitted.

Your advice was certainly pertinent to our assumption that transacting Enron
affiliates would all be off shore to Korea, kindly clarify whether the 
inability
to remit foreign exchange is the only consequence. Accordingly, what would be
the consequences of not filing a report or obtaining approval from BOK where 
the
two contracting parties are on shore Korean entities?

I tried to call you today, but understand you are on vacation until 28 August
2000. I would be most grateful if you could answer the above question when you
return.

Many thanks
Matt

Mark, 

I will be back in Houston this weekend, so I wanted to check with you for a 
time to come meet you and the other people next week.? Right now my schedule 
is wide open so let me know a time that is convenient for you.

Sorry if you have left any messages on my cell phone.? Estes Park is outside

I look forward to hearing from you.

Mark the position is relatively straight forward. Enron Australia Finance 
Pty.Ltd.(EAF) trades Australian Power Derivatives under what is known as an 
exempt market declaration (safe harbour provision). There are a number of 
requirements to be met under this Declaration including a list 
"qualifications" of the persons who can enter into a transaction. The only 
qualification likely to apply to a non- Australian resident is if  a party 
registered under the Declaration (such as EAF) reasonably believes  that the 
entity has tangible assets with a market value of at least AUD10M (USD6M). 

What happens if we contract with someone who does not have this asset level 
and none of the other tests apply? In all likelihood nothing. However, the 
Australian Regulator (ASIC) would expect EAF to have procedures in place 
aimed at compliance with the provisions of the Declaration. We are required 
to report annually on these procedures. We are also currently in discussions 
with ASIC aimed at extending our Declaration to all products traded through 
EOL in Australia. This is to ensure we are prepared should legislative 
changes eventuate next year requiring trading in all derivatives to be 
licenced. Any suggestion that we do not have procedures in place to ensure 
compliance with the intent of our current declaration would be of extreme 
concern to ASIC. They placed particular emphasis on our assurances that we 
are not going to be entering the "retail" market and will have procedures to 
ensure this occurs. 

In essence what am saying is that we need to be able to point to procedures 
to show we are taking reasonable steps to ensure that our counterparties meet 
the qualifications to trade power derivatives.  My concern is not with  
Australian companies - there are a number of tests that apply to them apart 
from just asset level.  Also we can handle them from here.But when a company 
appears on Tana's list that is say incorporated in the US and does not trade 
in Australia there seems no way of checking unless some assessment is  made 
of its asset level. I thought this was being done as per procedures developed 
(see procedures attached to following email).  

Rather than bounce emails between us can we arrange a brief phone discussion 
on this point?

Subject: EnronOnline access to Australian Power products

Thanks for dealing with Tana on these issues.  It is not entirely clear to me 
what you want the policy to be regarding which counterparties have access to 
Australian power products.  You probably already know that the EnronOnline 
people want every counterparty everywhere in the world to have access to 
every product unless Credit or Legal can justify restricting their access.  
Credit already performs a financial test on each counterparty to determine if 
they meet the CFTC Eligible Swap Participant requirements.  Unfortunately, 
that test is not as restrictive as the Australian tangible assets test.  It 
sounds like there should be a US$6 million tangible assets test applied by 
Credit before we give any counterparty access to Australian Power (this would 
be a total pain but certainly possible).  On the other hand, if you feel 
comfortable giving access to non-Australian counterparties  without that test 
being performed, we can do that, too.  Pleas let me know if we should ask 
Credit to start performing this test on all counterparties or if it should be 
limited to Australian entities.

Eric, 

Please find Mark Taylor's comments related to your request:

Steve Douglas-Tax person working on the MG Acquisition suggested an October 1 
date related to MG acting as a clearing broker due to the following:
-Value of the transaction would be impacted if imputed income was made 
related to acting as a clearing broker.
Phone number - 713 853-0938

David Mitchell-CFTC Attorney with the Law firm of Kad, Walder, Wickershe, and 
Taft
  Mark Taylor needed to address some items with David

Mark Taylor - phone number 713 853-7459

I would suggest talking to Steve Douglas for Tax questions and Mark Taylor 
for legal questions.  Please let me know if I can be of any assistance.
(have not heard from Al)

Thanks,
Jeff (713 853-5294)

Good news.  Milbank's research has confirmed the advice provided by Sullivan 
and Cromwell that the game will not vioate gaming or lottery rules or the 
like in the US, with the exception of the states of Florida and New York.

Clement-

I am temporarily based in Tokyo and have been working with Mark Taylor to put 
together our ISDA related documentation for use in Japan with Japanese 
counterparties.  

With regard to the Enron Corp. guaranty, it is believed that utilizing New 
York law, as opposed to Texas law, may be more palatable (based on local 
market practice) for the Japanese counterparties.  Therefore, I would like to 
obtain your view in doing so.  Attached hereto, is a draft of the guaranty 
for your reference (this particular draft has been prepared for The Mitsui 
Marine and Fire Insurance Co., Limited).

Thank you for your kind attention to this matter.

Best regards,

John Viverito

My thoughts are.......:

The Terms and Conditions for Use

I would add  the following text at the end of section 4:

that, pursuant to the Belgian law of 14 July 1991 on Commercial Practices, 
this website is to be considered as being advertising (reclame/publicit,). 


The Letter

The following text should be added as a footer:

The attached confirm is a swap.  There is no need for a rep in the confirm.  
If a weather deal is structured as an option, Gordon Heaney (backed by Diane 
Anderson) who confirms weather transactions, adds the weather-specific Trade 
Option rep into the confirmation.  The desk uses a template for options.  Let 
me know if you have any other questions.  Sara

Houston next Thurs or Fri (24th or 25th) to discuss the venture in greater 
detail, pending completion of the NDA.  Therefore, I'd like to get it to him 
today.  Michael Robison has already reviewed it from the Global Markets legal 
perspective and has no problem with the NDA.  Since the discussions may 
ultimately lead to some use of EOL, we thought it prudent to get your input 
at this stage.

I'm at x-37377 if you care to discuss the background further.

Thanks,

Doug

Dear Mr. Brannvoll,

I just spoke with our Legal contact and he advised me that your Enron North 
America ISDA will cover any 
derivative product trading conducted with ENA. The long description for the 
product will identify which 
entity you are transacting with.  At which time the European office sponsors 
a product, the trade would be 
considered with a new counterparty and it would be necessary to obtain an 
ISDA with this entity.  The ENA 
ISDA would then be re-excecuted using the new counterparty name.    

One contact I have made during the course of our discussion is Mr. Mark 
Taylor in our Legal Department.  He has
offered his name as a contact available for calls on this matter.  His number 
is 713-853-1459.

I hope that this answers your question.  Please feel free to contact myself 
or Mark in any other
questions you may have.

Regards,

Camille

Dear Camille
Thank You very much for your fast answer, I appreciate this a lot.
I have today spoken with Mr. Martin Holmes in your London office, and I have
now ( I hope) understood, that by dealing with Clickpaper.Com, I eventually
will have a trade with Enron North America, and as StoraEnso Financial
services is having a ISDA documentation in place these trades will then be
covered through this ISDA.

Please let me know if this is wrong.....................

  Dear Mr. Brannvoll,

  We received your question today regarding the principal in
transactions on
  Clickpaper.com.

  In anwswer to your question, the principal in transactions
conducted on
  Clickpaper.com is the particular Enron entity that is making
the market in
  the particular commodity that is being traded.  Currently,
all products
  traded on Clickpaper .com are purchased or sold by Enron
North America
  Corp., a Delaware corporation that is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Enron
  Corp.  As Clickpaper.com  adds products to the trading
selection and
  expands its trading operations to additional European
countries, and as
  Enron expands its pulp and paper trading operations, we
anticipate that
  other Enron entities will be the principal in certain
transactions,
  depending upon the product and transaction.  However, we
currently
  anticipate that the principal win every transaction
conducted on
  Clickpaper.com will be a direct or indirect subsidiary of
Enron Corp.

  Please note that potential customers of Clickpaper.com are
required to be a
  party to a Master Agreement with an Enron entity, or to
agree to on-line
  General Terms and Conditions, for a particular product
before transacting
  in that product.  Those Master Agreements and General Terms
and Conditions
  identify the entity that will the principal to that
transaction.  You can
  always contact Clickpaper.com's Customer Service if you have
any particular
  question about those agreements or the entity that is
transacting in a
  particular product.

  Thank you very much for your inquiry.

No problem weather observations don't know national boundaries. In fact ENA 
has already done an OTC Australian weather trade. Clearly the GTCs will need 
to be converted into an ENA form.

You both may already by aware of this, but the online team has contacted me 
and it is their desire to have the Japanese & Australian products also 
offered out of the U.S. by Enron North America.  They would continue to be 
offered by their current companies, "Enron Australia" and "EnronJapan", but 
they want the products sold "24 hours a day" and I guess to do this they 
would be offered also by Enron North America.  Do you see any legal issues 
from your side with a your Japanese or Australia products being offered by 
Enron North America too?

Sorry for the delay in catching up with my e-mails. Yes, MG London Inc is the 
clearing member of NYMEX/COMEX and is FCM & CTA. The only other MG companies 
who have any exchange/regulatory registrations are in the UK and are 
Metallgesellschaft Ltd (LME & SFA, also LIFFE to come), MG Brokers Ltd (LME & 
SFA), MG Metal & Commodity Co Ltd (LME only).

Grateful if you could complete the picture for me and for Mark Taylor.    Is 
MG London Inc. the entity that is the Clearing Member of NYMEX + a Futures 
Commission Merchant and Commodity Trading Advisor?   Do any other (MG) 
entities have similar registrations, and if so, what are these?

   I fully endorse Mark's suggestion to load up our ISDAs. A worldwide data 
dase of this nature is a valuable resource.  I have access to the data base 
and refer it. Getting our contracts on is on my to do list. What is the best 
way forward.   Yes I will be over in October, I fact I will staying a month. 
However, if there is anything we can do to get info loaded up sooner? We are 
most willing to put in the resources.

When access is being granted could it also be given to my Admin assistant 
Alison Keogh and also Rob McGrory who is also working under my direction on 
ISDA documentation.

Thanks for taking the initative on this matter.

Subject: Financial Trading Legal Database

David,

Mark Taylor asked me to talk to you about getting your ISDA Masters inputted 
into our Financial Trading Database.  This databse is the central master 
database where we keep records of the financial agreements in either draft 
form or that have been executed.  London currently updates this database to 
manage  its (and Singapore's) financial contracts and I would like to get the 
Australian agreements plugged into the system.

This database serves a number of purposes.  First, it is our core memory of 
contract negotiations.  Anyone in Legal and Credit around the world can take 
a look at this database and determine who we have entered into contract with 
and what negotiation issues may be at issue.  It is critical as we become a 
global trading company that we are consistent in the legal positions we take 
on these financial contracts.  For instance, it would be quite problematic if 
someone in Houston was negotiating a contract with an ISDA counterparty and 
asserted that a certain position was critical, if we find out a lawyer in 
another office was negotiating with the same counterparty and gave on the 
same position the day before.  We need to make a somewhat coordinated effort 
on the counterparty front.

In addition, with so many masters and so many counterparties there is just no 
way to keep track of what we have said or done unless we have a database.

Further, we use the information in the database to respond to inside 
auditing, reporting and insurance inquiries.

For online trading, I check the database to see if we have a financial master 
agreement and what trading restrictions we may or may not have in place. 
Global contracts uses this database to confirm their financial contract 
records and approval for online trading.

For both Houston and London we use the database to communicate with our 
Clients, whether traders or  back office support people.  Employees outside 
legal have  limited view access only to see all the information except the 
confidential Legal and Credit comments.  They have no edit capabilities.  The 
database also has some reporting functions that we and London Legal have 
found helpful.

You should have gotten my email to Mike Neves, out database coordinator 
requesting full edit access for you.  It usually takes a few days.  Once you 
get access maybe you could find some time to surf the database, and we can 
figure out how to get your ISDA data inputted..

Are you coming to the ENA Legal Conference in October?  That would be a good 
time for me to do a full review of this database with you.

Sara-

An agency agreement has been contemplated between Tokyo and Houston.  I 
believe it would be best to have Susan Musch advise on this issue, as she is 
handling the tax aspects relating to these activities and was also involved 
in the arrangements between Sydney and Houston.  I have copied Susan on this 
correspondence.

As to the netting issue, please confirm my understanding, that the issues 
are; (i) that we do not want different Enron entities (i.e. Enron Japan Corp. 
and ENA) entering into ISDAs with the same Japanese counterparties; and (ii) 
that if Enron Japan Corp. is transacting with a bank, with which ENA has an 
ISDA in place, we would amend such existing ISDA to cover the multibranch 
situation. 

I have not yet had detailed discussions with Mark regarding the issues you 
have raised.

Best regards,

John

John:  I just wanted to stay in the loop for Japan as to Gary Hickerson's 
FX/rate/equity counterparties.  My understanding from Gary is that  EGM 
(through ENA) will continue to hedge the business originating in Japan, 
subject to tax and any regulatory input.  I don't know if this has 
necessitated an agency arrangement  between Japan and Houston (or another 
office, similar to London or Australia).  Also, for netting reasons, Japan 
would not duplicate existing counterparty  ISDA's with ENA, and to the extent 
Japan is transacting with a bank having an agreement with ENA, we could amend 
the agreement for multibranch purposes if necessary (e.g., Bank of Montreal 
if the bank is transacting from multiple locations that need to be added to 
ENA's agreement).

Please advise if you have already had these discussions with Mark Taylor.  I 
look forward to hearing from you.  Sara

The current policy is to destroy recordings after 6 months.
However, this policy is not being implemented by our Telecoms group at the 
moment which is awaiting confirmation that the 6 month period is appropriate 
(not clear why).  
It appears that no recordings have been destroyed for at least 2 years.
A firm has been contracted to destroy recordings as soon as the go-ahead is 
given.

Obviously we want to be consistent across jurisdictions and I wanted to check 
with you that the retention period in Houston is still 6 months.  Please 
confirm.

Also, John Sherriff is keen for traders to be given guidance on what not to 
say on recorded lines, perhaps with some case studies to provide a salutary 
lesson or two!  Have you guys done anything similar in the US?

I look forward to hearing form you. 

Thanks and regards

Paul

Everybody,

Tanya suggested I ask all of you if you know anything related to a hotline 
call I took yesterday afternoon.  I got a call from John Arnold who wanted to 
know who was working on getting an ISDA in place with a subsidiary of 
Citibank. He thought it was a hedge fund, he wasn't sure.  He said that they 
were getting very impatient to start dealing with us.  He left a contact for 
Citibank:  Jerry Peskuchi (212) 723-7065, who wants to be updated on the 
status of the master.

Sorry I didn't bring this up in the morning meeting, but please let me know 
if any of you know anything about this, because I had no idea who to direct 
his call to and could only promise to try and find the right person handling 
this and pass the info on.

Mark:  I scheduled a meeting with you at 4:30 pm today to discuss the MG 
acquisition, in particular, MG London, Inc. (a U.S REGULATED NYMEX clearing 
member, FCM, CTA).  NO ONE is looking into this from a US regulatory/legal 
perspective and I think it should be the swap group.  Enron's "regulated" 
product areas are metals (since MG clears its own trades on the NYMEX/COMEX 
and has FCM/CTA status) and potentially agriculture if we (some Enron entity) 
choose to become a regulated "ATOM" (ag trade option merchant).  From a legal 
perspective, I think we should have a "whitepaper" drafted by Sullivan & 
Cromwell, and, it should include an analysis of the MG London, Inc. existing 
situation.  This would tie into the ag regulation.  Also, have you thought 
about ENA and MG as NYMEX members and whether we keep both designations, 
whether we move all/part of ENA's existing clearing business to MG (and 
perhaps eliminate the need for margin/brokering arrangements such as Paribas, 
etc.) and any other related issues?  For efficiency purposes, Donna Lowry has 
asked to join us.  Donna and I had a conference call this morning with 
Justin, Paul, Jon Barrett, Sheila Glover and Trena McFarland to figure out 
who's on first (with MG).

Also, I am attaching an update of my workload.  I have reached the breaking 
point and I need more help (even with Jason's help on brokerage agreements 
the new electronic trading platform agreements are reaching multiple 
proportions with a new request for agreements for ENA, ECT Investments and 
EnronCredit.com London).  Gareth and Craig Clark want to meet today about the 
prepay (Delta/Citibank) and I REALLY need help on the Global Finance side.

See you later.  Sara

Raquel Guzman, the lawyer for the referenced counterparty called again, and 
she is going on vacation next week and wants to get that ETA finalized so 
they can start trading when she's out.  She seems to feel the way the ETA is 
written that they are responsible for all unauthorized use of the password, 
including hackers into the system, and wants the language limited to use 
caused by their fault or negligence.  Can you call her at 215/684-6630.

Anne,

I have not done a hard read of the Schedule, but upon briefly reading, I 
noticed that in Part 4 (j), there is waiver of jury trial.  This is a very 
high policy issue for Enron Corp.  As a matter of Enron Corp. legal policy, 
Enron Corp. cannot agree to waiver of jury trial.  This policy is specific to 
Enron Corp. and may or may not   apply to the operating companies.  If there 
was an agreement to such a term, it would require approval by Mr. Derrick.  I 
can only recall one time that Mr. Derrick approved the waiver.  Also, in Part 
4(h), by virtue of the language, Enron Corp. agrees to jurisdiction in any 
court.  If jurisdiction is to be contractually agreed upon (and silence is 
not an option), the choices should be Texas (which in this case is probably 
not an option) or New York, with the specific courts being the United States 
District Court for the Southern District sitting in Manhattan or, if in state 
court, the Commercial Division of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, 
County of New York.  Let me know your thoughts.

Clement

Dave:

Our right to use Dow Jones name other than with the content under license is 
restricted to use that is pre-approved by Dow Jones.  Thus, you need to make 
sure that every reference to Dow Jones (other than the actual link to the 
publications and the publications themselves) is pre-approved by Dow Jones.  
I'm not sure what type (if any) of permission we have received from Reuters 
and the other trade publications to use their name on the web site and/or in 
marketing materials other than in connection with the publication of their 
content.  I alerted Kal Shah to the fact that we would need express 
authorization to use their names in marketing efforts, both hard copy and 
on-line, weeks ago but am not sure what, if any, approvals have been 
obtained.  In looking over the test web site, I noted at least one place 
where we refer to the various publications and was concerned whether we had 
obtained approval to market the names.

Please follow up with Mark Taylor on this matter if we don't touch base.

Subject: Comments & questions re: EOL Korea =20

To Jae- Moo,=20
1. Impressive P'point presentation indeed.

2. Friday Sep 1 - 800am TYO time is good for Australia, I will be attending
is there anything that i need to arrange at our end ??

3. After the successful roll-out of W for Japan & Oz thus qtr,=20
as discussed - we are ready to roll-out Korean W say in Mid October ???
Your email & presenatation thus arrived at a very good time.

4. Just some questions -
You may answer in the conference call or by email -- your choice=20

(a) why has W derivatives been singled out by FSC for potential review=20
when there is no regulation of eg LPG , or plastics swaps & fwds  ?  (pg 11=
=20
of presentation)

We are just talking about the theoretical possibility of FSC's (Financial=
=20
Supervisory Commission) review of Weather Derivatives because of the novelt=
y=20
in Korea although, according to the Kim & Chang report, there are currently=
=20
no laws or regulations in Korea that regulate marketing of OTC derivative=
=20
transactions through the internet or otherwise.  When we talked to FSC a=20
couple of months ago, they confirmed that there is no law or regulation=20
restricting Weather Derivatives in Korea.  FSC did not indicate any intenti=
on=20
to review Weather Derivatives for regulation, either.   In addition,=20
according to the Kim & Chang report, Weather Derivatives would not be=20
considered to be an insurance contract subject to Korean insurance=20
regulations.  Kim & Chang also believes that Weather Derivatives should not=
=20
be considered gambling or wagering but a legitimate method of hedging risks=
=20
relating to weather.

(b) How necessary are the meetings with ( pg 5 of presentation)
".. Bank of Korea (BOK)/ Ministry of Finance & Economy (MOFE) for=20
classification of weather derivatives as commodity derivatives.." ?
Is this meeting to meet
"...except for Foreign Exchange Transaction Regulations (FETR) in case of=
=20
foreign currency trades
? Classification of weather derivatives as commodity or financial derivativ=
es=20
under FETR needs to be resolved..."(pg 15 of presentation)

Can we just do it first with Enron Korea as the counterparty ? If so , if=
=20
Korean coy transacts with Enron Korea,
there should be no problem in remitting funds wholly within Korea !
Also we intend to offer product in Won only so no FX involved at all .

According to the Kim & Chang report,   FETR is the only regulation that=20
regulates OTC derivative transactions, and FETR is applicable only when FX =
is=20
involved in a transaction or when a transaction is between a Korean residen=
t=20
and a non-resident.  Thus, as far as we understand based on the Kim & Chang=
=20
report and conversations with FSC and other local lawyers, if a transaction=
=20
(Weather derivative or other commodity derivative) is between residents in=
=20
Korea (e.g., a Korean customer and Enron Korea) in Korean currency (Won),=
=20
neither FETR nor any other regulations are applicable.  No report or approv=
al=20
would be required.  =20

(c)=20
pg 18 of presentation=20
'...All other EnronOnline products with the exception of bandwidth and=20
emission allowances are classified as commodity derivatives in Korea..."
Why is it bandwidth and emission are classified differently?
Will not Weather fall under same category ?

There is no classification or definition of bandwidth, emission or weather=
=20
derivative products in Korea since Korea has no experience in such products=
=20
or concepts.  Please refer to my previous e-mail to Matt for definitions of=
=20
derivative transactions (commodity and financial).

"...Commodity derivatives require a prior reporting to the Bank of Korea fo=
r=20
each trade .."
Is this only relevant if product is not in Won but foreign currency ?

The reporting requirement is relevant under the FETR only which is applied=
=20
for a transaction with FX involved or between a resident and non-resident i=
n=20
Korea. =20


5. pg 28 of presentation=20
Note that Dr Christian Werner - Sydney office will be the person for=20
"Data system =01  For weather derivative products, arrange with a weather=
=20
forecasting company for the weather data feed - timing depends on the=20
location"

We will provide relevant information for Christian.

We will be able to assist with (if reqd, see points 4b & c above)  Thanks. =
It=20
would be necessary only when we decide to deal with FETR.
"...=01  For weather derivatives, arrange presentation meetings with BOK/MO=
FE=20
for classification of weather derivatives as commodity derivatives
_ May require longer time for their decision making =20

Subject: Re: EOL Korea =20

Jae-Moo

On the section of Regulatory/Legal Environment, it may be useful to note:

1. There is no official rule or regulation that ex post facto reporting for=
=20
Commodity Derivatives are acceptable to the Bank of Korea, although your an=
d=20
Korean external lawyer's (Kim & Chang) informal verbal enquiries with the=
=20
Bank of Korea have suggested they have accepted some  7 or 8 reports since=
=20
April last year (all from Hyundai Oil).

2. The Bank of Korea take up to two weeks to review the reports and, as Kim=
 &=20
Chang has advised, there remains a possibility that the Bank of Korea may=
=20
reject the report, although they were not able to advise the grounds on whi=
ch=20
a report may be rejected.

3. Although, a foreign counterparty need not file a report or seek approval=
,=20
the Korean counterparty must still do so for the benefit and interest of th=
e=20
foreign counterparty. Kim & Chang advised that where reporting or approval =
is=20
required but is not made or obtained, the Korean counterparty would not be=
=20
able to remit its payments under the transaction. This would clearly impact=
=20
on the settlement of the transaction, in particular shorter term deals sinc=
e=20
reporting and approval may take several weeks.=20

4. The Supreme Court of Korea has ruled that a foreign exchange authorizati=
on=20
that was originally required should be obtained in order for a foreign part=
y=20
to execute any judgment against the Korean party and remit the proceeds.=20

Subject: EOL Korea

As many of you are aware, over the past few months we have been investigati=
ng=20
whether or not it would make sense to seriously consider an EOL launch in=
=20
Korea from a market, regulatory and legal perspective.  The primary interes=
t=20
has been on reviewing whether or not we could launch existing products in=
=20
Korea (e.g., products already handled by Singapore EOL) as well as new=20
products (e.g., Seoul weather).=20

This initial work was directed primarily by the Korea team working within t=
he=20
APACHI group.  If a launch is to progress much further from this point,=20
however, substantial attention by the EOL team would be required.  To=20
facilitate this, the attached presentation summarizes our primary findings =
to=20
date and some of our thoughts.  We would appreciate your taking a look at t=
he=20
attached document.

We would like to arrange a conference call for next Thursday (Aug. 31st) at=
=20
6:00 pm by Houston time (Friday at 8:00 am by Tokyo time) to discuss the=20
attached document and to solicit thoughts as to next steps.  Please let me=
=20
know whether you will be able to join this call or, if you have a conflict,=
=20
an alternative time.  Your participation will be greatly appreciated. =20

Hey Mark, nice to hear from you.  I am glad you enjoyed the wedding.  It went
by so fast for me but it seems that people had a good time.  Apart from a few
travel related glitches the honeymoon was also spectacular.  Tahiti is a true
paradise.

I am committed to the concept of sailing in the Carribean but my problem is
that my honeymoon has put me firmly in "vacation deficit" at the SEC.
Barring any emergency congressional action I will not have enough days
available by Tgiving to truly enjoy sailing in the Carribean.  Amanda has
told me how much fun it is and I want to do it but I may need to find another
time.  I'll check into it and let you guys know definitively very soon.  How
long to you go for?

Keep in mind though that I do not speak for Amanda.  She has an uncanny
ability to arrange her schedule so that she can participate in virtually
every vacation idea that people bring up.

I'll be in touch,  Bill.

Hi Mark,

I was just wondering if you had had the time 

To think about  the issues we need to address if we were to have a draft 
agreement  with the Houston Chronicle on us posting prices in the Houston 
Chronicle. The last we talked about it you were going to put some basic ideas 
together in an email and send it to Louise and myself. 
To see whether there would be any issues if we offered transaction ID's to 
brokers. Can we offer them selectively  Can we charge them for it ?


I know you are really busy  but Louise would like us to move forward with 
this and I was hoping to get something back from you on this soon. Thanks.

Savita

On an ISDA I am reviewing, credit has asked that all indebtedness of the 
Canadian counterparty to its affiliates be subordinated to us (in this case 
ECC).  Does anyone have access to a Canadian form of subordination 
agreement?  I imagine that a fairly bare-bones form would suffice.  Thanks -- 
Bob

How did we get comfortable with MG charging commission on transactions?

In fact its the whole thing about them using agreements which are offline?

weather rep also in confirmations when we trade under a master?

Below are the international lawyers who need to be notified of form changes.  
Notify them only when forms are completed (not as they might be evolving).  
Also, they should be using the swap forms in the attorney bank, so they need 
to know where they are located.

Have you talked with Al Penisi?  His telephone number is 212-715-5200.  Al is 
well-versed in the regulatory/legal issues (he worked at the and could

Eric, 

Please find Mark Taylor's comments related to your request:

Steve Douglas-Tax person working on the MG Acquisition suggested an October 1 
date related to MG acting as a clearing broker due to the following:
-Value of the transaction would be impacted if imputed income was made 
related to acting as a clearing broker.
Phone number - 713 853-0938

David Mitchell-CFTC Attorney with the Law firm of Kad, Walder, Wickershe, and 
Taft
  Mark Taylor needed to address some items with David

Mark Taylor - phone number 713 853-7459

I would suggest talking to Steve Douglas for Tax questions and Mark Taylor 
for legal questions.  Please let me know if I can be of any assistance.
(have not heard from Al)

Thanks,
Jeff (713 853-5294)

Jeff-

Thanks for the memo.  After meeting with Al Pennisi in NY on Friday and 
discussing your memo, I am confident that all the issues you raise can be 
addressed so that we can have MG London act as Enron's clearing broker.  I've 
asked him to contact you to review in more detail.  Please let me know the 
outcome and action plan - - - is it feasible to complete this week?

Here is the status of this project.  As you may know, we decided 8 weeks ago 
that the timing was to be postponed for 2 regulatory reasons:

1.  Definitive Market Rules were to be postponed until March 1, 2001
2.  Res. 149/99 forbids marketing companies from being short, i.e. we wanted 
to have an initially long position of 30 to 50MW on the book.

Last Thursday Res. 290/00 was publish by ANEEL which validates some 
components of DMR.  At this stage, I feel much more comfortable with this 
risk (basically: symmetry in penalties and rewards for settlement of short 
and long positions, respectively, as well as some comfort in the 
enforceability of settlement process and credit guarantees granted through 
involvement of CBLC).  This is to start on September 1, 2000.  We still have 
to satisfy requirements under Res. 249/99, but I think that our EOL launch 
date for power products may be sooner than anticipated.  This is why, while 
we send you the attached report on the status of our efforts, we ask you not 
to put too much emphasis on the deadlines indicated as they will most likely 
be pushed backward.  This project gets back on front burner.

Thanks for feedback if needed and for collaborating with us.

Remi



P.S.: Ricardo and I sat down with Steve Nagy and D'Arcy Carroll last week to 
brief them on the project and our stage of advancement.  Steve agreed to 
focus and take the lead on the IT section.  I also wanted to get D'Arcy's 
feedback as he is very much involved with EOL (it's part of E. Networks) and 
he will be responsible for the launch of marketing of other commodity 
products in Brazil (at least this is my understanding).

The Product is as follows:

William Stuart on the FX desk will offer the Product to Enron canada Corp on 
an internal basis only. The GTC will be an 'internal only' GTC that we use 
that tells any external customer that may inadvertantly access the internal 
trade that the transaction is freserved for internal trading only; the only 
radio button will be a "REJECT GTC", which further prevents an external 
customer from transacting.

Stuart will post a Fixed Price price that represents the USD/CAD Exchange 
rate on Trade Date. The Fixed Amount will be a CAD amount equal to volume 
multiplied by Fixed Price. The Floating Amount will be a CAD Amount equal to 
the volume multiplied by the Index, where the Index is a Floating Price equal 
to the USD/CAD.

There are several arguments as to whether this should be classified as a 
Forward or a Financial transaction. Our effort was to arrive at something 
that would be easily understood by the market in the event that we begin to 
offer this product externally.

The full Product description is attached. Please go in and offer your 
approval.

Leslie:
I received your voice mail.  Can someone fax to me at home a copy of the 
latest Talisman ETA amendment that Dave F. looked at?  Also, would it be 
possible to indicate on what you sent to me the parts that Dave F. didn't 
like?  It would make it easier for me to respond and less time consuming 
since I don't have much free time during the day but I'm happy to help out.  
As Mark knows, this was a highly negotiated series of amendments over a long 
period of time.  My hope is that we can work through Dave's concerns without 
having to retrade what we had agreed to on the legal side.  My fax number 
here is 281-890-8862.

Hello Mark,

Justin Boyd told me that your can help me with questions regarding Chile.
We got a request for guest access through MG.
The company is called Escondida and is a subsidiary of BHP Australia.

Please advise if I can set up a guest account or not.
F.Y.I.: MG is planning to put a "in w/h Chile" contract for Copper on-line as 
soon as Enron has done the due diligence for this country.
Thanks !

Subject: Legal & Privacy Statement for EOL

Justin:

Travis recently forwarded to me the language you proposed adding to Section 4 
of the ClickPaper Terms and Conditions for Use:

"For European Union residents: please note that Enron Europe Finance & 
Trading Limited is authorized to carry on investment business in the United 
Kingdom by the UK Securities and Futures Authority (SFA) and had reviewed and 
approved the contents of this website for relevant regulatory purposes. The 
services referred to in this website are intended only for commercial 
enterprises and not for private customers as defined by the rules of SFA. 
Enron will not enter into transactions with persons who would be regarded as 
private customers under the rules of SFA.  For Belgian residents: please note 
that, pursuant to the Belgian law of 14 July 1991 on Commercial Practices, 
this website is to be considered as being advertising (reclame/publicit,)."

Section 4 of the EnronOnline Legal and Privacy statement contains a similar 
provision stated in a somewhat different manner.  Whereas the above language 
specifically provides, "The services referred to in this website are intended 
only for commercial enterprises and not for private customers as defined by 
the rules of SFA. Enron will not enter into transactions with persons who 
would be regarded as private customers under the rules of SFA."  Section 4 of 
the EOL Legal and Privacy states only that "The website is intended only for 
commercial enterprises in certain specified jurisdictions."

Do you want me to revise Section 4 of the EOL Legal and Privacy statement to 
conform to the ClickPaper language or are you comfortable with the EOL 
language as currently drafted.

I have attached a final version of the EOL Legal and Privacy statement for 
your review and reference.

Regards,

Leslie

		 Subject: Gaming advice in the various EU jurisdictions


Thank you for your e-mails.

I set out below the advice we have received from the various jurisdictions.

1.  Countries that can be added to the approved list:

We have now received the advice from Portugal, and as with the Euro 2000
game, the High Five Flag Game does not violate Portugese law, because
participants do not have to pay to enter and because it is run outside
Portugal - so you can add Portugal to the list of approved jurisdictions.

Finland can now also be added to the approved list. The game would not be
considered a lottery, as the players would not pay to enter.  It should not
be considered a restricted marketing measure providing there is no
obligation to purchase goods (which I understand is the situation).  Tax
issues were also initially a concern i.e. it was thought that Enron might be
liable to pay tax if it awarded a prize to a Finnish citizen.  However,
after discussions with the relevant tax authorities, this tax issue seems to
have fallen away - because Enron, as a foreign organiser would not have any
liabilites towards the Finnish tax office.  [If a Finnish citizen won the
prize, they themselves might have to pay tax on it - but I assume that this
is not a concern of Enron, since they themselves would not have liability
towards the Finnish tax office].

2.  Countries that could possibly be added to the approved list, provided
certain facts are confirmed (with either Enron or the regulatory
authorites),and/or  further information is provided.

As with Euro 2000 Poland is also looking likely - the Polish lawyers require
me to confirm that Enron's customers are permitted to use Enron's website
for online trading even if they have not purchased anything from Enron in
the past and do not intend to do so in the future.  It is my understanding,
that this is the case  - so assuming this is correct, Poland could be added
to the approved list.

Belgium - it is unclear under Belgium law whether the game is a Games of
Chance, a Lottery, or a Contest.  They need to forward a demo to the
regulatory authorities.  I have not yet checked whether the demo sent
yesterday is complete enough (our web access was very slow thsi morning)  -
but, as suggested in your e-mail, I will contact Dave Samuels if I need a
substantially more complete demo.

Italy - Approval is needed in Italy if the game is an advertising contest
addressed to Italian residents. The scheme would be classified as an
advertising contest - the key is whether it is addressed to Italian
residents.  Our Italian lawyers would like to know how many users there will
be in Italy, and would like us to confirm that the site will be in English
and from a server located in the UK. In order to obtain approval, the
Italian lawyers need to know whether Enron has a subsidiary in Italy - if it
does, the application needs to be made on behalf of this company, - if it
doesn't have an Italian subsidiary then they cannot actually apply for
approval of the scheme.  An integral feature of being an advertising contest
is that a prize is awarded, so if Italian participants are excluded from
being awarded a prize, the game won't be an advertising contest addressed to
Italian residents.

Sweden - The game is a lottery under Swedish law and therefore requires
approval (which there is virtually no chance of Enron obtaining because it
is not a charitable organisation) if it is addressed to the Swedish public
(as a general rule more than 250 people).  Our Swedish lawyers therefore
need to know how many participants there are in Sweden - if it is less than
250, then there seems to be a good chance that the game can go ahead - but I
will confirm this with them.

Norway.  There are four issues affecting the game in Norway - these are
whether the game is a lottery, whether the game is a money game, whether the
game promotes a business, and tax issues.  After informal talks with the
relevant ministries, th first two issues have fallen away, and are now no
longer a problem.  The Norwegian lawyers had some concerns as to whether the
purpose of the scheme  was to promote Enron - but I believe that, if I can
confirm to them that customers are permitted to use Enron's website for
online trading even if they have not purchased anything from Enron in the
past and do not intend to so in the future -  i.e. that the game is a
"gimmick" and not a promotional tool (as for Poland) this will drop away.
The tax issues are similar to those initially expressed by the Finnish
lawyers - and may fall away after consultation with the Norwegian
authorites.


3.  Jurisdictions where there is a technical  risk of violating local laws
but a low risk of enforcement

Netherlands - technically the game violates the Dutch Games of Chance Act
(DGCA). However, it  is not clear that the DGCA applies to internet games,
and our Dutch colleagues are not aware of any instances where internet games
have been prosecuted under the Act. They beleive that even if the Dutch
authorites were alerted to the game, games offered for a limited period of
time for moderate prozes would not be high on teh list of the dutch
authorities priorites!  There is also the issue that Dutch courts probably
won't consider themselves to have jurisdiction because, for example, the
prizes are expressed in GBP, the game is run from a UK server, the language
is English, and the game does not violate laws in jurisdiction it is run
from, although no guarantee of this can obviously be given.

4.  Miscellaneous

We await advice from Spain.  I have received, but not yet reviewed, the
advice from France (but from a brief glance, it does not look favouarble
regarding allowing French citizens to participate).


I also have advice from the various jurisdictions relating to whether Enron
employees themselves can participate (this looks favourable - obviously as
long as the game is conducted fairly).  I will review the specifics of this
advice, and forward it to you, along with the advice we have on disclaimers.
I should be able to do this this afternoon/evening  (UK time).

I have advice from most of the jursidictions on Olympic legislation.  Would
you like a summary of this advice for future reference? - it makes
interesting, if largely depressing, reading!

Rachel

Tana,

Before Carol St. Clair left for maternity leave, she was working on the 
assignment of some financial and gas deals with Christopher Smith (who 
previously worked in our group).  Since Christopher is no longer here and 
with Carol being out, I'm scrambling to find out who in the financial team is 
working on this.

I've left Mark Taylor a message since Carol's voice mail forwards all 
questions to Mark.

Could you let me know if you have any info?

Thx,

In addition to the exchange seats,  MG London is also licensed as an FCM and 
CTA with the CFTC --- the Enron acquisition requires a re-registration with 
respect to these licenses, and perhaps a great deal of unwanted

Sorry for the delay in catching up with my e-mails. Yes, MG London Inc is the 
clearing member of NYMEX/COMEX and is FCM & CTA. The only other MG companies 
who have any exchange/regulatory registrations are in the UK and are 
Metallgesellschaft Ltd (LME & SFA, also LIFFE to come), MG Brokers Ltd (LME &

Jon,

Grateful if you could complete the picture for me and for Mark Taylor.    Is 
MG London Inc. the entity that is the Clearing Member of NYMEX + a Futures 
Commission Merchant and Commodity Trading Advisor?   Do any other (MG) 
entities have similar registrations, and if so, what are these?

Thanks

Justin

Justin:

Do you know whether we have acquired any companies with CFTC registrations of 
any kind (e.g. Commodity Trading Advisor or Futures Commission Merchant)?  I 
was wondering who was responsible for compliance matters if we have.

I hope you're well and all my best to Fran.

Mark

Subject: Comments & questions re: EOL Korea =20

To Jae- Moo,=20
1. Impressive P'point presentation indeed.

2. Friday Sep 1 - 800am TYO time is good for Australia, I will be attending
is there anything that i need to arrange at our end ??

3. After the successful roll-out of W for Japan & Oz thus qtr,=20
as discussed - we are ready to roll-out Korean W say in Mid October ???
Your email & presenatation thus arrived at a very good time.

4. Just some questions -
You may answer in the conference call or by email -- your choice=20

(a) why has W derivatives been singled out by FSC for potential review=20
when there is no regulation of eg LPG , or plastics swaps & fwds  ?  (pg 11=
=20
of presentation)

We are just talking about the theoretical possibility of FSC's (Financial=
=20
Supervisory Commission) review of Weather Derivatives because of the novelt=
y=20
in Korea although, according to the Kim & Chang report, there are currently=
=20
no laws or regulations in Korea that regulate marketing of OTC derivative=
=20
transactions through the internet or otherwise.  When we talked to FSC a=20
couple of months ago, they confirmed that there is no law or regulation=20
restricting Weather Derivatives in Korea.  FSC did not indicate any intenti=
on=20
to review Weather Derivatives for regulation, either.   In addition,=20
according to the Kim & Chang report, Weather Derivatives would not be=20
considered to be an insurance contract subject to Korean insurance=20
regulations.  Kim & Chang also believes that Weather Derivatives should not=
=20
be considered gambling or wagering but a legitimate method of hedging risks=
=20
relating to weather.

(b) How necessary are the meetings with ( pg 5 of presentation)
".. Bank of Korea (BOK)/ Ministry of Finance & Economy (MOFE) for=20
classification of weather derivatives as commodity derivatives.." ?
Is this meeting to meet
"...except for Foreign Exchange Transaction Regulations (FETR) in case of=
=20
foreign currency trades
? Classification of weather derivatives as commodity or financial derivativ=
es=20
under FETR needs to be resolved..."(pg 15 of presentation)

Can we just do it first with Enron Korea as the counterparty ? If so , if=
=20
Korean coy transacts with Enron Korea,
there should be no problem in remitting funds wholly within Korea !
Also we intend to offer product in Won only so no FX involved at all .

According to the Kim & Chang report,   FETR is the only regulation that=20
regulates OTC derivative transactions, and FETR is applicable only when FX =
is=20
involved in a transaction or when a transaction is between a Korean residen=
t=20
and a non-resident.  Thus, as far as we understand based on the Kim & Chang=
=20
report and conversations with FSC and other local lawyers, if a transaction=
=20
(Weather derivative or other commodity derivative) is between residents in=
=20
Korea (e.g., a Korean customer and Enron Korea) in Korean currency (Won),=
=20
neither FETR nor any other regulations are applicable.  No report or approv=
al=20
would be required.  =20

(c)=20
pg 18 of presentation=20
'...All other EnronOnline products with the exception of bandwidth and=20
emission allowances are classified as commodity derivatives in Korea..."
Why is it bandwidth and emission are classified differently?
Will not Weather fall under same category ?

There is no classification or definition of bandwidth, emission or weather=
=20
derivative products in Korea since Korea has no experience in such products=
=20
or concepts.  Please refer to my previous e-mail to Matt for definitions of=
=20
derivative transactions (commodity and financial).

"...Commodity derivatives require a prior reporting to the Bank of Korea fo=
r=20
each trade .."
Is this only relevant if product is not in Won but foreign currency ?

The reporting requirement is relevant under the FETR only which is applied=
=20
for a transaction with FX involved or between a resident and non-resident i=
n=20
Korea. =20


5. pg 28 of presentation=20
Note that Dr Christian Werner - Sydney office will be the person for=20
"Data system =01  For weather derivative products, arrange with a weather=
=20
forecasting company for the weather data feed - timing depends on the=20
location"

We will provide relevant information for Christian.

We will be able to assist with (if reqd, see points 4b & c above)  Thanks. =
It=20
would be necessary only when we decide to deal with FETR.

Fool.com: Annuities -- Annuities: What's to Like?
 (http://www.fool.com/retirement/annuities/annuities01.htm)
Annuities: What's to Like?

As we so often do, let's start with some Foolish conclusions on annuities
(so those who absolutely don't want to read all about them have a quick
exit strategy) and then explain what they actually are. It's no secret
that within the confines of Fooldom, we're not enamored with tax-deferred
annuities (TDAs). We do not find ourselves waxing eloquent, sending
chocolates, or writing Foolish love poems to annuities, as we sometimes do
to individual stocks. The reasons for this are that annuities by and
large:
are too expensive
offer mediocre insurance coverage
restrict the owner's investment choices to so-so, ho-hum, quasi-mutual
fund subaccounts
do, as advertised, provide for tax-deferred investment growth, yet that
growth is taxed at ordinary income tax rates on withdrawal
lack liquidity
We strongly believe that Foolish investors can generally do far better for
themselves elsewhere. Indeed, unless you simply haven't been keeping up
with the stories of how brokers are getting rich with big commissions, and
feel a bizarre need to help out the brokerage community, you should
maintain a strong bias against annuities. They are desirable only (if
ever) for those who:
Have contributed the maximum to their 401(k) plans and IRAs and desire
further tax deferral on investment gains.
Prefer investing in mutual funds as opposed to individual securities.
Will keep the annuity for at least 15 to 20 years.
Are in a 28% or higher income tax bracket today, but expect to be in a
lower income tax bracket in retirement.
Don't need the annuity proceeds prior to age 59 1/2.
Are unconcerned that heirs must pay ordinary income taxes on any
appreciation.
Desire a "guaranteed" income for life in retirement.
If you meet all of those conditions, then an annuity may be quite
appropriate -- but that's a pretty select group of people. Nevertheless,
annuities are promoted and sold by brokers and insurance agents like
they're the some kind of panacea for your retirement. Is that right?

The Basics
Let's back up for a moment, and, now that we're in the middle of things,
restart from the beginning. What, after all, is a tax-deferred annuity?

Regardless of who sells it to you (broker, 401(k) plan, Martian), a TDA is
a contract between you and an insurance company. In exchange for getting
your hard-earned cash today, the insurance company agrees to pay you an
income for a specified period or for your life. Those payments may start
at some date in the future or they may start on the day you buy the
contract.

If the payments are delayed until the future, you have what's called a
deferred annuity. If the payments start immediately, you have an immediate
annuity. You pay for an immediate annuity with a lump sum of cash on the
day you buy it. You pay for a deferred annuity either with a single
lump-sum payment or with a series of payments made over a number of years.
Your investment in the annuity will earn a return, and those earnings will
grow untaxed until you receive annuity payments. Be aware, though, that
unless you purchase an annuity within an IRA, you will receive no tax
deduction for any investment you make in a TDA -- just a tax deferral on
your annuity investment earnings.

The Types
Tax-deferred annuities come in three flavors: fixed, variable, and
equity-index.
Fixed Annuities: As the name implies, a fixed annuity provides a
locked-in, guaranteed rate of return on the investment and a fixed, stable
income in its payout phase. A fixed annuity thus provides a steady
retirement income -- but this steady return can and will be eroded by
inflation. Options are available (at a price, always at a price) to have
your annuity payments increase by 3% to 5% each year should you so desire.

When used, the payments under that feature would initially be lower than a
fixed payment, but over the years the payments will steadily increase at
the specified rate. For those expecting to live many years, the added cost
of this feature might be worth the price, but expect to pay dearly for
this option.

Variable Annuities: Probably the most popular form of annuity these days,
a variable annuity allows the purchaser to decide how to invest the money
within a range of mutual fund look-alike investment options offered by the
insurance company. These investments are called "subaccounts." They often
carry the same name and are operated by the same investment managers as
publicly offered mutual funds, and they will typically offer a selection
of stock, bond, and money market subaccount investments. Nevertheless,
they are not the same funds because by law they cannot be.

While these subaccounts may invest much like a mutual fund, subaccounts
almost certainly will have a different and higher expense structure, and
possibly a far different return than that of the public mutual fund. Thus,
like a mutual fund and unlike the fixed annuity, the returns of the
variable annuity are not stable, and will vary along with the markets.
While this variability does carry downside risk, it nevertheless affords
the annuity buyer the ability to participate in the potentially greater
returns of the stock market. As the stock market rises, so does income
derived from an investment in a stock subaccount. Conversely, as the
market declines, so will income. Still, over the long-term, a variable
annuity invested in a stock subaccount should provide a much better
opportunity for inflation-protected income than a fixed annuity.

Equity-index Annuity: A recent innovation in the insurance industry, an
equity-index annuity is a form of a fixed annuity contract tied to a stock
index that provides the opportunity to earn returns better than those in a
traditional fixed annuity, but less than those of a direct investment in
the market itself. In this contract, the insurance company invests in a
mix of bonds and stock options designed to give a targeted participation
rate (explained below) on the return of a particular index (e.g., the S&P
500 Index). While the purchaser has no choice in the investment itself, he
or she is able to participate to a degree in stock market gains during a
rising market. If stocks fall, then the contract guarantees a minimum
return, typically 3%. Because of that guarantee, the equity-index annuity
has less downward volatility than the variable annuity.

There's no such thing as a free lunch however, so the equity-index annuity
will also limit the maximum returns of a rising market as compensation for
that guarantee. Most equity-index annuities use something called a
"participation rate" to limit returns. For instance, the insurance company
may declare a participation rate of 90% (some companies are as low as
50%), which means the annuity would be credited with only 90% of the gain
experienced by the equity index for that year. If the index gained 10%,
then the gain in the annuity would be 9% for the year.

And that's not the only way these annuities limit the return. Most will
also tie equity-index returns to those deriving from market price changes
only, and exclude any return due to the payment of dividends. As an
example, in 1998 the total return (i.e., capital gains and dividends) for
the S&P 500 Index as reported by Ibbotson Associates was 28.6%, while that
for just capital gains (i.e., market price) was 26.7%. An equity-indexed
annuity tied to the S&P 500 Index would typically use the smaller 26.7%
return. Couple that with a participation rate of 90%, and the return in
the index annuity becomes just 24%, some 4.6% below the total return of
the market. How's that for a double-whammy?
It's Your Choice
For retirees, an annuity offers the assurance of a stream of income for
life or for a specific period of time. For those who fear the potential
loss of all their money because of poor investment choices, that
"guarantee" is important. As Fools, we recognize that this "fear factor"
is real and does enter into many people's investment decisions.
Accordingly, we fault no one who chooses lower risk approaches, and that's
especially true of those who are retired.

But as Fools, we do urge those interested in annuities to recognize their
costs, their investment limitations, and their limited potential for
passing on wealth to heirs. If, after evaluating all those factors, an
annuity still appears appropriate, then as Fools we also urge the purchase
of a low-cost annuity such as one offered by Vanguard, T. Rowe Price,
Fidelity, AnnuityNet.com, or (in some states) TIAA-CREF. Why pay
commissions and high expenses when you don't have to? That enriches the
fat cats at your expense, and no Fool wants to do that. Keep the money in

Annuities market themselves on the basis of their ability to avoid
taxation on investment growth through tax-deferral. While it is true that
taxes on earnings are deferred within an annuity, this may not be achieved
in a way that is quite as useful as it sounds. Read about the real pros
and cons of annuity tax-deferral next.

Mark,
I noticed you weren't copied on this, and as Paul Simons is on holiday 
thought I would pass a copy on to you. The FX business which is referred to 
is that which was acquired with the Rudolf Wolff asset purchase on 6/30 
(executed by MG Metals). Gary Hickerson/Trena McFarland are currently 
reviewing the commercial options for this business.

Subject: Foreign Exchange from a US entity

David

Further to our recent telephone conversation, we would be grateful if you 
would give us a brief written summary on the regulatory and/or legal issues 
governing a US corporation transacting foreign exchange with US and non-US 
customers. My basic understanding of our telephone conversation was that, as 
a non-bank, neither the Fed, the SEC nor the CFTC have any jurisdiction. 
However the Commodities Exchange Act prohibits us from contracting with 
certain types of counterparties.

The potential business we are looking at currently covers outright foreign 
exchange with counterparties such as banks, securities houses, funds, 
corporates and, possibly, high net worth individuals. The business also 
covers the provision of EFP facilities for these customers whereby they 
ultimately receive a currency futures position on the IMM division of the CME 
or on FINEX. This latter area is one where, from the Exchanges' points of 
view, we would effectively be acting as an executing broker.

I hope this brief description is enough for you to be able to respond but if 
you have any questions or would like further clarification, you can contact 
me by e-mail or by telephone on +44 20 7265 5421.

Thank you for your help in this.

Kind regards.

Jon Barrett

Leslie - if this is possible, I would prefer for the EnronOnline L&P 
statement to contain the new text I had suggested for ClickPaper.com.  

However, where do we stand in terms of making the changes to the EnronOnline 
L&P statement - has this been done yet or are we just about to put the new 
EOL version online?

Thanks.

Subject: Legal & Privacy Statement for EOL

Justin:

Travis recently forwarded to me the language you proposed adding to Section 4 
of the ClickPaper Terms and Conditions for Use:

"For European Union residents: please note that Enron Europe Finance & 
Trading Limited is authorized to carry on investment business in the United 
Kingdom by the UK Securities and Futures Authority (SFA) and had reviewed and 
approved the contents of this website for relevant regulatory purposes. The 
services referred to in this website are intended only for commercial 
enterprises and not for private customers as defined by the rules of SFA. 
Enron will not enter into transactions with persons who would be regarded as 
private customers under the rules of SFA.  For Belgian residents: please note 
that, pursuant to the Belgian law of 14 July 1991 on Commercial Practices, 
this website is to be considered as being advertising (reclame/publicit,)."

Section 4 of the EnronOnline Legal and Privacy statement contains a similar 
provision stated in a somewhat different manner.  Whereas the above language 
specifically provides, "The services referred to in this website are intended 
only for commercial enterprises and not for private customers as defined by 
the rules of SFA. Enron will not enter into transactions with persons who 
would be regarded as private customers under the rules of SFA."  Section 4 of 
the EOL Legal and Privacy states only that "The website is intended only for 
commercial enterprises in certain specified jurisdictions."

Do you want me to revise Section 4 of the EOL Legal and Privacy statement to 
conform to the ClickPaper language or are you comfortable with the EOL 
language as currently drafted.

I have attached a final version of the EOL Legal and Privacy statement for 
your review and reference.

Regards,

Leslie

Re: CRE Resolution Encouraging the Use of Financially Settled Commodity 
Derivatives Transactions For Natural Gas Prices         .


The Energy Regulatory Commission (Comisi?n Reguladora de Energ?a) ("CRE"), 
published last Wednesday in the Federal Register a resolution by means of 
which the CRE encourages the use of financially settled commodity derivatives 
transactions ("Financial Instruments") to hedge the risk of the natural gas 
price variations in Mexico (the "CRE Resolution"). Over-the-counter Financial 
Instruments transactions are being enticed by the CRE in light of the surge 
of natural gas prices1. It is expected that such derivatives market will be 
expanded to other type of energy commodities, such as electric power.

Essentially, the CRE is encouraging the use of Financial Instruments by 
giving a discount of the price index applicable for the month of August, 2000.

The CRE Resolution provides in general terms that:

1. The Mexican Users2 that are able to sign a Financial Instrument with 
Pemex-Gas y Petroqu?mica B?sica ("PGPB"), or with any third party, before 
September 1, 2000, covering commodity prices fluctuations for the period of 
September 2000 thru February 2001, will benefit from a factor of at least 
0.75, which will be applied to the price of reference (i.e. $3.705 U.S. 
Dollars per MMBtu), which results in a price of $2.7788 U.S. Dollars per 
MMBtu, only during the month of August, 2000 (the "Discount Factor").

 2. Mexico's Local Distribution Companies ("LDCs"), that have contracted 
Financial Instruments for their clients, shall passthrough to the Users the 
benefits resulting from the Discount Factor, only if such end users have 
previously agreed upon the rendering of such services.

 3. Needless to say, the price determination for the period of September 
2000, thru February 2001, will be freely agreed upon between seller of the 
Financial Instruments, and the User or the LDC, as the case may be.


       Very truly yours,

To Jae- Moo,=20
1. Impressive P'point presentation indeed.

is there anything that i need to arrange at our end ??

3. After the successful roll-out of W for Japan & Oz thus qtr,=20
as discussed - we are ready to roll-out Korean W say in Mid October ???
Your email & presenatation thus arrived at a very good time.

4. Just some questions -
You may answer in the conference call or by email -- your choice=20

(a) why has W derivatives been singled out by FSC for potential review=20
when there is no regulation of eg LPG , or plastics swaps & fwds  ?  (pg 11=
=20
of presentation)

(b) How necessary are the meetings with ( pg 5 of presentation)
".. Bank of Korea (BOK)/ Ministry of Finance & Economy (MOFE) for=20
classification of weather derivatives as commodity derivatives.." ?
Is this meeting to meet
"...except for Foreign Exchange Transaction Regulations (FETR) in case of=
=20
foreign currency trades
? Classification of weather derivatives as commodity or financial derivativ=
es=20
under FETR needs to be resolved..."(pg 15 of presentation)

Can we just do it first with Enron Korea as the counterparty ? If so , if=
=20
Korean coy transacts with Enron Korea,
there should be no problem in remitting funds wholly within Korea !
Also we intend to offer product in Won only so no FX involved at all .

(c)=20
pg 18 of presentation=20
'...All other EnronOnline products with the exception of bandwidth and=20
emission allowances are classified as commodity derivatives in Korea..."
Why is it bandwidth and emission are classified differently?
Will not Weather fall under same category ?

"...Commodity derivatives require a prior reporting to the Bank of Korea fo=
r=20
each trade .."
Is this only relevant if product is not in Won but foreign currency ?


5. pg 28 of presentation=20
Note that Dr Christian Werner - Sydney office will be the person for=20
"Data system =01  For weather derivative products, arrange with a weather=
=20
forecasting company for the weather data feed - timing depends on the=20
location"

We will be able to assist with (if reqd, see points 4b & c above)
"...=01  For weather derivatives, arrange presentation meetings with BOK/MO=
FE=20
for classification of weather derivatives as commodity derivatives
_ May require longer time for their decision making =20

Jae-Moo

On the section of Regulatory/Legal Environment, it may be useful to note:

1. There is no official rule or regulation that ex post facto reporting for=
=20
Commodity Derivatives are acceptable to the Bank of Korea, although your an=
d=20
Korean external lawyer's (Kim & Chang) informal verbal enquiries with the=
=20
Bank of Korea have suggested they have accepted some  7 or 8 reports since=
=20
April last year (all from Hyundai Oil).

2. The Bank of Korea take up to two weeks to review the reports and, as Kim=
 &=20
Chang has advised, there remains a possibility that the Bank of Korea may=
=20
reject the report, although they were not able to advise the grounds on whi=
ch=20
a report may be rejected.

3. Although, a foreign counterparty need not file a report or seek approval=
,=20
the Korean counterparty must still do so for the benefit and interest of th=
e=20
foreign counterparty. Kim & Chang advised that where reporting or approval =
is=20
required but is not made or obtained, the Korean counterparty would not be=
=20
able to remit its payments under the transaction. This would clearly impact=
=20
on the settlement of the transaction, in particular shorter term deals sinc=
e=20
reporting and approval may take several weeks.=20

4. The Supreme Court of Korea has ruled that a foreign exchange authorizati=

Based upon where we stand today in the final implementation of EOL Argentina 
we have agreed upon a formal launch date of October 4th. Please be aware that 
from here in all deadlines and assigned responsibilities must be met. If 
there are any developing issues or potential conflict with the launch date I 
wish to be made aware directly.

On the afternoon of October 4th we will host a formal energy industry kick 
off event in Buenos Aires to establish our initial market momentum. 

Thank you for everyone's assistance and co-operation.

Subject: EnronOnline Australian Power GTCs

Attached is the revised GTCs that address taxation issues for non-Australian 
resident counterparties. These GTCs have received tax clearance and hence all 
approvals have now been given to allow them to be loaded. Enclosed also are 
the procedures that need to be followed when new counterparties are being 
considered. To date we have been vetting potential counteparties in the 
Sydney office. I suggest that the procedures be made available to anyone else 
who may be given this responsibility. 

One new matter has come to light. In July 2000 with the introduction of GST 
in Australia new legislative arrangements will come into place. They will 
require businesses to have an "ABN". It has been suggested that we amend the 
password application to request the counterparty's ABN.

Dear Mark

Before they give their final confirmation that the game can go ahead in
Poland, our Polish lawyers would like me to forward to them some information
as to the critria Enron use to decide who can and can't trade online.  I
guess that they are wanting to know whether the criteria are basically
objective i.e based on credit ratings etc or whether they are more
subjective.  In practice, what sort of companies do Enron refuse online
trading access to?

Thanks

Rachel

Mark Taylor will finalize all issues relating to the EnronOnline Games in my
absence.  Please follow up with Mark to advise re the status of Italy,
Norway
and Sweden (and any other countries that we may be able to move to the
"Approved
List.")  Also, please confirm that for the purpose of screening individuals
who
should not play the game, the appropriate question is "Country of
Residence."

Thank you so much for all of your invaluable assistance on this project!

Rachel:

I don't think we're going to be interested in reimbursing for connection
costs
so I think we should just keep France in the lists of "not approved."

With regard to the data protection issue, I have actually sent Justin an
e-mail
on this various issue to determine if our current legal & privacy language
is
sufficient or if we need additional language in the rules.  I will forward
you
that e-mail.  If you go into the Registration Screen of the demo game, you
will
see that individual participants will be required to enter their name,
e-mail,
address and telephone number.

I look forward to your comments on this issue.

Leslie

 Dear Leslie


France
I have now read through the French advice.  The DGCCRF (lottery regulators)
have confirmed that a game offered on a website may well be regarded as
involving a financial contribution due to the cost of Internet
communication.  This means that the game probably does fall foul of French
lottery legislation.   One way round this might be to offer to reimburse
connection costs.  If this is done, then there are still a couple of
"indirect contribution" issues to sort out (these relate to being seen not
to promote Enron, and so may fall away as in other jurisdictions, although
French law on these matters is generally stricter).  There is also a
possibility that a bailiff needs to be appointed  to adjudicate in the case
of disupute, but I get the impression from the French advice that this could
probably be got round by further discussing the matter with the DGCCRF.

Is offering to reimburse connection costs feasible? - if it isn't then,
there is presumably little point in "tidying up" the indirect contribution"
and "bailiff" issues.

The game will not be a lottery if no prize is awarded i.e. there must be an
expectation of profit/gain. Hence in theory,  not awarding the prize to a
French resident should allow the game to be played in France.  The French
lawyers seemed to have concerns about how this could be done practically - I
am not sure I understand their concerns, and have asked them for
clarification.  I assume that Enrons French customers are French companies,
and that we would need to exclude employees of such companies, together with
employees of other Enron Customers (for example UK companies) who happen to
reside in France. I have asked our colleagues in France for clarification
that such exclusions would suffice, and will forward you the essence of
their replies.



I set out  below a list of countries where the game would be lawful,
providing prizes are not awarded to residents of that country.

Netherlands
Belgium
Sweden
[France] - subject to clarification of our French lawyers concerns
Italy

As mentioned in my previous e-mail, some of these countries may move into
the "approved" list anyway.  I have not received express advice on this
particular issue from Norway - but there advice implies that not awarding
prizes would be ok, and if the tax issue scan be sorted out, Norway may move
to the approved list anyway.  I will however ask them to confirm the "not
awarding prizes" point for completeness.  I have not received advice on this
point from Spain.

You may recall that for the Euro 2000 game, colleagues in Belgium were
concerned that if prizes are not to be awarded to Belgium residents, then
this needs to be made very clear from an early stage, so that Enron are not
misleading partcipants of that country into thinking that they will be
awarded a prize if they are not going to be.  If ineligbility for prizes is
placed prominently in the rules, and partcipants have to read the rules
before playing, then I  guess that this covers this issue.  Although none of
the advice from the other jurisdictions has mentioned this point, I think it
would apply anywhere where partcipants cannot be awarded prizes.


Countries where Enron could avoid liability by using disclaimers pointing
out that residents of that particular country cannot play and by having an
online registration process are:

Spain (based on previous Euro 2000 advice)
Italy
Netherlands
Denmark
Sweden

Belgium - but note the comments made re Euro 2000 that there is a very
slight chance that an online registartion process might raise evidential
difficulties i.e. Enron might not be able to prove in a court that Belgium
participants had been properly advised of their ineligibility.  Belgium law
requires written proof of such terms in contracts with consumers.

Rules

I have not had chance to review the rules in detail.  One issue that may be
important from a European point of view is data protection i.e. protection
of personal data including names and addresses of partcipants and consent to
trnsfer data - I will look into this and let you know.  As mentioned above,
the inelegibility of residents of certain jurisdictions for prizes will need
to be included in the "eligibility" section.

Miscellaneous

One issue which was touched upon in a previous e-mail was whether the word
"Olympic" could be used in a disclaimer.  I will look into this further and
get back to you on this matter next week.  As requested, I will summarize
the Olympic advice for you also.

Regards

Rachel

John and Michael would like to put together training for London-based traders 
on the "dos and don'ts" of using recorded telephone lines - As part of this 
we're listening to tapes to pick up on some "don'ts" (eg racist comments, 
harrassment, breach of SFA rules etc) which we can possibly use as case 
studies (you'll be pleased to hear that so far we haven't found anything of 
this nature!).

Have you given any training on this subject to traders in Houston?  Any 
materials you may have used or thoughts you have on this would be very much 
appreciated.  Thanks a lot.

Paul

Any answers on this?

Also have you checked into the Reuters agreement to see if it would cover 
confidentiality associated with a potential price posting discusion.

Bob - please pursue, you will need to talk to Mark Taylor as there were 
regulatory issues with the funds.

Thanks Mark  - we'll pursue - hope things are well with you too.  All is 
going fine here.

Subject: new counterparties for EOL?

Louise - I think that John indicated to me that he had or would be suggesting 
to you that hedge funds might be a group of counterparties to get online with 
EOL.  I have also suggested to John, and pass along to you now, an 
additional/different group.  Lately, I have been receiving proxies from a 
number of the mutual funds (the equivalent of your unit trusts and investment 
trusts in the UK) I own (some with the Fidelity funds family in Boston, some 
with the AIM funds, based in Houston [but with a UK parent]), seeking (and 
receiving) shareholder authorisation to trade in commodities.  Particularly 
given the cost pressures on mutual funds these days, the low-cost option of 
EOL would seem a good product for them.  Anyway, in the event that you had 
not targetted this potentially large number of counterparties and funds, I 
wanted to pass along this suggestion/idea.  Hope all is going well.  mcs

Just thought I'd let you know that I have graduated from paralegal school.  
I'm glad it is over, but I'm so glad that I did it.  I was able to put the 
puzzle pieces together and figure out why I was asked to type those 
pleadings!!!  I just learned yesterday that I graduated top in the class.  
I'm thrilled about that.  Maybe I'm smarter than Tana thought I was.  
Yippee!!!!Still miss seeing you everyday - life is all about change they 
say.  As ever, Jan

Susan/Tana,

We have recently traded a deal on Enron Online in which the entity offering 
the trade was ENA and the entity entering the trade was EPMI Long Term Hedge 
(Power group hedging with ENA).  This is currently booked as RMT vs. EPMI 
Long Term Hedge.  Can we send out a confirmation based on ISDA terms since 
this is an Enron subsidiary per Global Counterparty?  I'm assuming this is 
just like doing a deal with Enron Global Exploration and Production, EES or 
ECT International, but let me know if I'm incorrect.

Thanks,
Joe

Hi Louise

We haven't yet - I am waiting for Bruce to return from vacation to discuss 
with him.  In the past Bruce has expressed the view that he wants to move 
away from the commission charging methodology.  Tim Jones has recently 
re-iterated MG's desire to maintain commissions as they get $25m from 
commissions p.a.

Will let you know the outcome.

Regards

Amita

How did we get comfortable with MG charging commission on transactions?

In fact its the whole thing about them using agreements which are offline?

Over the last several years, we've received numerous questions and candid 
comments from many of you on a wide range of topics during our eSpeak 
sessions and through the Office of the Chairman online mailbox and 
voicemail.  While eSpeak is an open, informal chat between employees and 
management, the Office of the Chairman online mailbox and voicemail box are 
designed as confidential upward feedback tools for employees who choose 
anonymity.  We are pleased that many of you have openly expressed your 
thoughts and your identity, which made it possible for us to quickly respond 
to your questions and concerns.  This is the kind of work environment we all 
must strive for at Enron, and we encourage you to continue sending us 
comments about the things that are important to you.

Many times, however, we wanted to respond to those of you who contacted us 
anonymously with your good ideas, observations and questions.  We now have a 
way to do this while maintaining your confidentiality.  In the future, when 
we receive an anonymous question or comment from an employee, both the 
question and our response will be posted on eMeet.  This will allow us to 
answer all the questions that we receive, and it will give other employees an 
opportunity to provide their insight, if they choose to do so, since eMeet is 
an open discussion board.

Remember:  You can send your questions and comments to us in two ways:
 - email to Office of the Chairman, or
 - Office of the Chairman voicemail box at 713-853-7294, which is a 
confidential call

Promoting open and honest communication is consistent with our Vision and 
Values and absolutely vital to our continued success as a company.  So don't 
be hesitant or afraid to speak your mind.  We want to hear from you.

We have finalized the terms of the EnronOnline direct connect pilot program.  
The following points outline the primary terms of the program.  Subject to 
your review we will begin implementation of the program pursuant to these 
terms.  Please review the terms and let me know if you have any questions or 
comments.

Direct Connect service will include the provisioning of T1 connections 
between Enron counterparties and various Enron PoP's.  EnronOnline specific 
traffic will be transported to these Enron Pop's via the Enron Intelligent 
Network.
EBS will implement and manage the direct connect service on behalf of 
EnronOnline.  All customer support relative to the direct connect service 
will be managed by EBS.
In the event of a failure of the direct connect service, the user will access 
EnronOnline via an Internet connection.
The pilot program will last for an initial term of 12 months.
EnronOnline will pay $1750 per month for installation and monthly charges for 
the local loop, all backbone and/or internetworking charges and ongoing 
support for any North American client that comprises at least 1% of all 
EnronOnline transactions (see attached list of eligible counterparties).
Any EnronOnline customer that does not comprise at least 1% of the 
EnronOnline transactions may obtain a direct connect to EnronOnline through 
EBS for $1750 per month.
All direct connect customers will be responsible for providing a router that 
can accept a T-1 circuit.
All direct connect customers will receive a Service Agreement from EBS that 
will specify the terms of the service.

I would like to begin contacting these customers ASAP so please contact me 
with any issues by noon on August 21, 2000.  

Attached is a spreadsheet that outlines the EnronOnline funded participants 
in the pilot program.

Jae-Moo

On the section of Regulatory/Legal Environment, it may be useful to note:

1. There is no official rule or regulation that ex post facto reporting for 
Commodity Derivatives are acceptable to the Bank of Korea, although your and 
Korean external lawyer's (Kim & Chang) informal verbal enquiries with the 
Bank of Korea have suggested they have accepted some  7 or 8 reports since 
April last year (all from Hyundai Oil).

2. The Bank of Korea take up to two weeks to review the reports and, as Kim & 
Chang has advised, there remains a possibility that the Bank of Korea may 
reject the report, although they were not able to advise the grounds on which 
a report may be rejected.

3. Although, a foreign counterparty need not file a report or seek approval, 
the Korean counterparty must still do so for the benefit and interest of the 
foreign counterparty. Kim & Chang advised that where reporting or approval is 
required but is not made or obtained, the Korean counterparty would not be 
able to remit its payments under the transaction. This would clearly impact 
on the settlement of the transaction, in particular shorter term deals since 
reporting and approval may take several weeks. 

4. The Supreme Court of Korea has ruled that a foreign exchange authorization 
that was originally required should be obtained in order for a foreign party 
to execute any judgment against the Korean party and remit the proceeds.

Matt

Subject: EOL Korea

As many of you are aware, over the past few months we have been investigating 
whether or not it would make sense to seriously consider an EOL launch in 
Korea from a market, regulatory and legal perspective.  The primary interest 
has been on reviewing whether or not we could launch existing products in 
Korea (e.g., products already handled by Singapore EOL) as well as new 
products (e.g., Seoul weather). 

This initial work was directed primarily by the Korea team working within the 
APACHI group.  If a launch is to progress much further from this point, 
however, substantial attention by the EOL team would be required.  To 
facilitate this, the attached presentation summarizes our primary findings to 
date and some of our thoughts.  We would appreciate your taking a look at the 
attached document.

We would like to arrange a conference call for next Thursday (Aug. 31st) at 
6:00 pm by Houston time (Friday at 8:00 am by Tokyo time) to discuss the 
attached document and to solicit thoughts as to next steps.  Please let me 
know whether you will be able to join this call or, if you have a conflict, 
an alternative time.  Your participation will be greatly appreciated.  

Best regards,

Jae-Moo

Dave:

As I mentioned yesterday, I have made a few more revisions to the Legal & 
Privacy statement to respond to a couple of issues raised by Justin Boyd.  
The final version is attached.  I was unable to run a red-line of this 
document, so I have summarized the revisions below:

1.  Section 2, second sentence:  replaced the word "derivatives" with 
"derivations".
2.  Section 4:  revised in its entirety.
3.  Section 9, first sentence:  added "all or" before the words "any part of 
the website" in the third/fourth line and replaced the word "the" with "this" 
before the words "Legal and Privacy statement" at the end of the sentence.
4.  Section 11(a):  capitlized "Information"
5.  Section 13:  revised the reference to "this paragraph 6" to refer to "the 
paragraph 13"
5.  Note that I added the new Section 17 at the bottom relating to T1 access.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Leslie

I am sorry if you miss understand what I said but I would like to reiterate 
that I said IF customer had a master in place, that it would also cover 
EnronOnline but that would have to be verified by the legal group.  That is 
why I emailed and called both Mark Taylor and Leslie Hansen and had them get 
involved.    I had also explained all this to Tim Reyes with Alcoa.

It sounds like Mark has lead you in the right direction for assisting 
customer.

The problem stems from two areas:

1) When ALCOA accesses the trading site,  the prompt for Enron's terms and 
conditions comes up with a further prompt to agree or disagree to the 
conditions.  ALCOA's legal team has determined that they should not agree to 
the conditions because they have an existing ISDA agreement in place with MG 
Ltd.

2) ALCOA has talked to EOL's help desk (specifically Kathy Moore), who 
subsequently has determined (I assume with Enron legal) that the current ISDA 
in place with MG Ltd. is sufficient to begin trading EOL's OTC metal products.

In further discussions I had with Mark Taylor today,  he basically confirmed 
that the ISDA that's in place is valid for EOL's OTC metal products, but said 
that I should confirm with either Edmund Cooper or Justin Boyd in London for 
final confirmation of the legal questions, and Frank Davis for the EOL access.

In addition, Mark alluded to the probability that Enron legal/compliance does 
not have a listing and/or copies of ISDA's that MG Ltd. has in place with 
customers.  If you'd like, I can help facilitate that.  Please advise.

Could you confirm for me the following via telephone and/or e-mail:

1) That the current ISDA ALCOA has in place is valid for EOL's OTC metal 
product trading.

2) That their account can access the site without the term and conditions 
prompt.

Please contact me if you have any further questions or concerns.

Regards,
BEF

We need some advice on this one - we are not in any negotiation with Altra 
now and anything we were talking about is under a Confidentiality.

Andy needs some advice on how to pursue - obviously it helps them to say the 
haven't been left out of the loop.  Andy will fill more in.

Enron moves make waves in electronic trading industry.(Brief

  Leading online platform signs agreements with HoustonStreet Exchange
and True Quote

  EnronOnline, Enron Corp.'s giant online platform,, has made the first
Commodity in what may become a consolidation of competing electronic
trading exchanges in the energy industry.


  Enron Net Works, the division which operates EnronOnline, last week
signed cooperative agreements with HoustonStreet Exchange and True quote
LLC.

  And industry sources confirm that EnronOnline is negotiating similar
deals with several other exchanges, including Houston-based Altra Energy
Technologies and RedMeteor, as well as e-Speed, an exchange backed by
Dynegy and, Williams.

  HoustonStreet Exchange, headquartered in Portsmouth, N.H., was
recently ranked among the top 20 dependent energy exchanges by AMR
Research, a Boston consulting firm which put Altra in first place.

  True Quote, based in Louisville, Ky.,  a startup trading platform
being developed by APB Energy -- an over-the-counter brokerage firm --
along with PG&E National Energy Group, EnForm Technology and Microsoft
Corp.

  EnronOnline is the world largest commodity trading platform, but users
an only trade with Enron. Rather than being a true trading exchange,
industry insiders describe it as simply an online extension of Enron's
business.

  But in EnronOnline's first six months of operation after being
launched last November, the value of transactions conducted on the,
system surpassed $50 billion at a rate of $1.5 billion a day. The
platform offers trading in a wide variety of commodities, from most
forms of energy to bandwidth and paper

  MORE EYEBALLS

  The agreements EnronOnline has struck will enable the company to post
the prices at which it will buy or sell natural gas and electricity on
HousonStreet.com and TrueQuote.com Neither HoustonStreet nor TrueQuote
prices, however, will appear on EnronOnline. Customers on those two
sites who click on an Enron quote will be instantly linked to
EnronOnline, where the trades will take place.

  "As Louise (Kitchen, president of EnronOnline) said, extending their
pricing to more eyeballs will build more transaction volume for Enron,"
says Paul Bourke, president of Altra. "The question is whether it will
build volume for the other exchanges.

  "We are talking to Enron," Bourke adds. "We are intrigued, and we are
attempting understand what the business benefits to Altra would be."

  He says an Enron-Altra deal would be "more complicated" than those
involving other exchanges because of Altra's significant liquidity in
natural gas. Altra is the leader in online natural gas trading.

  While none of the exchanges would reveal what, if any, financial terms
are involved in the agreements--other than to say there is no sharing of
commissions --Bourke says he expects that if Altra and Enron finalize an
agreement, Enron would take a small equity position in Altra. He
speculates that this is what Enron did with HoustonStreet.

  Brian Pieri, vice president of Red Meteor, says the value of
EnronOnline to the other exchanges is that "they bring' tight-bid
offers, which is something the exchanges have to work hard on. And more
people will make the bid offers even tighter."

  This means buy and sell prices are close together, which helps market
liquidity.

  Asked if the additional liquidity and trading volume that Enron might
bring to the other exchanges wouldn't just further fragment the market,
Pieri compared the whole online trading scene to a sixth-grade dance.

  "The boys are all on one side of the room and the girls are on the
other side, and nobody is dancing. Somebody has to start and then
everybody else joins in. Enron brings more validity to this very new
situation," Pied says.

  "All of the exchanges are trying to build liquidity, of which Enron is
the king," says Bill Swanton, an analyst with AMR Research.

  Swanton predicts that the energy exchanges will consolidate within the
next six to eight months, and the ultimate surviving exchanges will not
be owned by any single player.

  "You need an independent exchange. I can't imagine Enron will end up
running it. The trading community won't be satisfied with that," he
says.

  Swanton points out, however, that Enron "will attract attention they
don't want if they force, some of these guys out of business."

  But HoustonStreet's CEO, Frank Getman, takes a different view of what
the Enron deals mean.

  "Web-based energy trading exchanges are no longer about liquidity,
thanks to these EnronOnline data deals," he says. "The game is now about
functionality and value-added services."

Attached please find the latest version of the Official Rules of the 
EnronOnline Games.  The following steps are necessary to finalize the rules:

1.  Receipt of final advice from LinkLaters re approved jurisdictions.  
Norway and Sweden, and perhaps Italy, are likely to be moved into the 
approved list and can be added to the eligible jurisdictions in the 
Eligibility section.  

2.  Currently, if a participant is not eligible to win a prize, he/she is not 
eligible to win.  However, if you change your minds and decide to open up the 
game to individuals who cannot win prizes, add the following to the Official 
Rules, as well as the Front Page and Registration Page disclaimers:

"Residents of Belgium, [France], [Italy], the Netherlands, [Sweden] . . .  
may participate in the game but are ineligible to win any prizes due to 
regulatory restrictions."    Confirm the list of jurisdictions with 
Linklaters.

3.  There is a section entitled "Scoring System/Point Weightings" that has 
not been completed.  It just says "To be Confirmed."  Please complete this 
section as appropriate.



Unless I notify you that I was unable to finalize the Rules before leaving 
for vacation, Mark Taylor will handle finalizing these Rules.

Regards,

Leslie

Justin

Our understanding is that FX traded from the US is effectively unregulated. 
If we use MG London Inc, there would be the possibility that the CFTC would 
have some type of oversight on the unregulated business. Only the posting of 
the IMM EFPs needs to be done through the FCM.

There are other practical issues here in that that MG London Inc currently 
lacks the infrastructure needed to do the outright FX business as it has no 
bank FX lines and no bank accounts for all the currencies. There are other 
issues where the main settlements/back office expertise is here in London. 
These are obviously not insurmountable but we need to do a lot of work to get 
either MG London Inc or, for example, MG Newco Inc ready for the business. Is 
there an angle for using Enron North America, for example, as I understand 
they already have existing FX lines and settlements or would that be a 
non-starter? There are currently some UK and EU customers on Wolff's books 
who would need to be routed via an SFA regulated arranger. Will we be able to 
use EEFT for this?

Rgds

Jon

Jon,

I had a glance over the written paper from Sullivan & Cromwell as to FX 
Transactions, and it seems to me that there would be fewer US regulatory 
issues (should there be any), if we were to use MG Brokers Inc, the FCM 
entity.  Are there any other reasons why we would not want to use this entity?

[Mark/Alan/Marcus - I have separately sent you by email the Sullivan & 
Cromwell paper]

Thanks.
Justin

Jon, 

My suggestion would be for the FX business be run out of a NON FCM firm in 
the states (NY) since it is a non-regulated product.

When the Master does not have the weather modification to the Trade Option

this feasible?

The London office is forwarding recent legal advice from our lawyers in South 
Africa regarding FX clearances.  It seems that prior to transacting with a 
South African party, we need copies of the party's "certification" from the 
National Bank allowing the party to make payments out of the country (thereby 
converting local currency to USD).  Such approvals are severely restricted.  
I will forward the memos to Susan Bailey for inclusion in our "database" of 
global advice.  Sara

I have spoken to Jeff and we would like to have a meeting at 3:00 Calgary 
time (4:00 Houston time, 2:00 Portland time) tomorrow to discuss legal 
product definition and identification for the PPA, including:

1.  Firm Physical i.e. Master and GTC;

2.  Interruptible Physical

3.  Firm Financial i.e. ISDA; and

4.  Enron Online.

Structured or Origination deals will be dealt with on a case by case basis to 
manage the structural risks created by the PPAs.

Products need to be developed as soon as possible to accomodate trading the 
PPA Jan 1/00.

Please call Sharon @ 403.974.6726 to confirm, and she will set up a dial in 
number.

Regards, Peter.

John:  I just wanted to stay in the loop for Japan as to Gary Hickerson's 
FX/rate/equity counterparties.  My understanding from Gary is that  EGM 
(through ENA) will continue to hedge the business originating in Japan, 
subject to tax and any regulatory input.  I don't know if this has 
necessitated an agency arrangement  between Japan and Houston (or another 
office, similar to London or Australia).  Also, for netting reasons, Japan 
would not duplicate existing counterparty  ISDA's with ENA, and to the extent 
Japan is transacting with a bank having an agreement with ENA, we could amend 
the agreement for multibranch purposes if necessary (e.g., Bank of Montreal 
if the bank is transacting from multiple locations that need to be added to 
ENA's agreement).

Please advise if you have already had these discussions with Mark Taylor.  I 
look forward to hearing from you.  Sara

With respect to he Bakersfield Californian on the list below, I am amending 
my original approval for this counterparty to approve them to enter into 
newsprint swaps and options only.  At this time our list does not reflect the 
individual products you are trading.  I understand from Mark Taylor that he 
spoke to Jeff Harbert last night about amending your excel spreadsheet to add 
the individual pulp and paper financial products, since restrictions such as 
this one will occur from time to time.

down to trade the current products we have available online.  As our product 
base expands, we can send them through again as an amended counterparty if we 
offer newprint commodity swaps and options online.

FYI.  Can you and the clerks handle packing up my office?  I may be able to 
help but I don't want to make any commitment  that I can make it up there.  
Hopefully, it won't take that long and the only files that need to be marked 
or perhaps put in the legal assistant area are the files near my window.  If 
the move-out timing slips and happens while you are on vacation, I would 
prefer that it be handled before hand so that the floater doesn't have to 
worry about it.  Let me know what you think.  Sorry to impose but I tried to

It looks like Phase II of our construction project (over where Julia's office 
used to be) will be finished on the 18th so she will be moving into her new 
office that weekend.  I now have the plans for Phase III and it turns out 
your office will be included in the construction area.  Phase III will 
probably start on the 25th.  That could always slip but I wanted to give you 
as much notice as possible.

Hope you are all doing well.  Getting any sleep yet?

Hi Mark:

Thanks for your fast and honest reply.  I will print a hard copy of the 
online help for you to review.  At this point there are minimal changes being 
made to the help; mostly button and screen names changing.  I will wait until 
later in the week when it is closer to final and get you a hard copy.  Thanks,

I'm just a lawyer and as such still operating pretty much in the stone age.  
The easiest way for me to look at something that is primarily text (minimal

exists as a Word document that would be great.  I have not yet actually been 
able to see the phase 2 site.

David,

Mark Taylor asked me to talk to you about getting your ISDA Masters inputted 
into our Financial Trading Database.  This databse is the central master 
database where we keep records of the financial agreements in either draft 
form or that have been executed.  London currently updates this database to 
manage  its (and Singapore's) financial contracts and I would like to get the 
Australian agreements plugged into the system.

This database serves a number of purposes.  First, it is our core memory of 
contract negotiations.  Anyone in Legal and Credit around the world can take 
a look at this database and determine who we have entered into contract with 
and what negotiation issues may be at issue.  It is critical as we become a 
global trading company that we are consistent in the legal positions we take 
on these financial contracts.  For instance, it would be quite problematic if 
someone in Houston was negotiating a contract with an ISDA counterparty and 
asserted that a certain position was critical, if we find out a lawyer in 
another office was negotiating with the same counterparty and gave on the 
same position the day before.  We need to make a somewhat coordinated effort 
on the counterparty front.

In addition, with so many masters and so many counterparties there is just no 
way to keep track of what we have said or done unless we have a database.

Further, we use the information in the database to respond to inside 
auditing, reporting and insurance inquiries.

For online trading, I check the database to see if we have a financial master 
agreement and what trading restrictions we may or may not have in place. 
Global contracts uses this database to confirm their financial contract 
records and approval for online trading.

For both Houston and London we use the database to communicate with our 
Clients, whether traders or  back office support people.  Employees outside 
legal have  limited view access only to see all the information except the 
confidential Legal and Credit comments.  They have no edit capabilities.  The 
database also has some reporting functions that we and London Legal have 
found helpful.

You should have gotten my email to Mike Neves, out database coordinator 
requesting full edit access for you.  It usually takes a few days.  Once you 
get access maybe you could find some time to surf the database, and we can 
figure out how to get your ISDA data inputted..

Are you coming to the ENA Legal Conference in October?  That would be a good 
time for me to do a full review of this database with you.

Hi Brent, I have been in contact with Dale Neuner regarding the creation of 
the Product Types for Argentina, by now he has all the necessary information. 
We will need your approval on the wording that was suggested for the long 
description and other legal sign-off. I have already gone through the product 
descriptions with Andrea and no mayor comments came up. Regarding Natural Gas 
products, her comments were that we are creating a Firm product with TOP 
100%, but that is OK. Then on the additional information like delivery 
points, term, currency and unit of measure, all those alternatives have been 
given to Dale for him to load into the system.
Please give me an update on your timetable for these issues.
Regards

Patrick

Dear Mr.Viverito

Thank you very much.
Now we start checking your draft and maybe we can return comment on this
Friday.

Please be advised following points at this time.
1)Part 6 on the schedule is needed to be deleted.
  We think that it's enough if the terms in Part 6 are referred in the
individual confirmation.
2)ISDA Credit support annex is not acceptable
  Unfortunately, we don't have internal system for concluding CSA with
non-financial entity.

Please keep support us for concluding ISDA ASAP for our business in near
future.
If any question, please feel free to contact me.

Best regards,

Leslie - if this is possible, I would prefer for the EnronOnline L&P 
statement to contain the new text I had suggested for ClickPaper.com.  

However, where do we stand in terms of making the changes to the EnronOnline 
L&P statement - has this been done yet or are we just about to put the new 
EOL version online?

Thanks.

Subject: Legal & Privacy Statement for EOL

Justin:

Travis recently forwarded to me the language you proposed adding to Section 4 
of the ClickPaper Terms and Conditions for Use:

"For European Union residents: please note that Enron Europe Finance & 
Trading Limited is authorized to carry on investment business in the United 
Kingdom by the UK Securities and Futures Authority (SFA) and had reviewed and 
approved the contents of this website for relevant regulatory purposes. The 
services referred to in this website are intended only for commercial 
enterprises and not for private customers as defined by the rules of SFA. 
Enron will not enter into transactions with persons who would be regarded as 
private customers under the rules of SFA.  For Belgian residents: please note 
that, pursuant to the Belgian law of 14 July 1991 on Commercial Practices, 
this website is to be considered as being advertising (reclame/publicit,)."

Section 4 of the EnronOnline Legal and Privacy statement contains a similar 
provision stated in a somewhat different manner.  Whereas the above language 
specifically provides, "The services referred to in this website are intended 
only for commercial enterprises and not for private customers as defined by 
the rules of SFA. Enron will not enter into transactions with persons who 
would be regarded as private customers under the rules of SFA."  Section 4 of 
the EOL Legal and Privacy states only that "The website is intended only for 
commercial enterprises in certain specified jurisdictions."

Do you want me to revise Section 4 of the EOL Legal and Privacy statement to 
conform to the ClickPaper language or are you comfortable with the EOL 
language as currently drafted.

I have attached a final version of the EOL Legal and Privacy statement for 
your review and reference.

Regards,

Leslie

The problem with using something other than a quantitative measure (like 
percentage) is that we quickly get into something to argue about with the 
customer.

Some alternatives off the top of my head to get the ball rolling:

- Gross Error determined by independent arbitrator or possibly an appointed 
third party (auditor?)
- Transaction which differs by more than x% from verified other transactions 
between independent companies during the same period (not just quotations).
- Transaction which does not lie within the boundaries of other transactions 
between independent companies which occurred on that day.
- Transaction which does not lie within the bid-offer hi and lo range 
identified by industry price reports published for that day. (obvious 
limitations here)

I think 5% is way too small. At certin physical locations for both gas and 
power, a 5% move is easily achievable in the normal course of business i.e. 
35 mwh power to 45mwh or Transco Z6 from 5.00 to 5.50 in the next trade. I 
think something in the neighborhood of 20% to 25% is
commercially reasonable.

In approximately one month (9/9/2000), we are targeting that a new version of 
the Oracle NT client (8.1.6), Borland Database Engine (BDE) 5.1.1 and 
Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC) 2.5. to all Corp/ENA workstations. 
This software provides the connectivity from your workstation to Enron's 
Oracle databases and the applications supported by them.  We are currently in 
the process of testing all the applications managed by Corp/ENA Information 
Technology to ensure that they will be compliant with this new software.

This change may also effect your own developed MS-Access, MS-Excel 
spreadsheets, and/or MS-Query documents that retrieve data from Enron's 
Oracle databases via ODBC drivers. As part of the upgrade, all Oracle ODBC 
connections will be upgraded to compliant driver versions. 

If you would like to test your MS-Access databases and/or MS-Excel 
spreadsheets under the new software releases, please use one of the 
workstations at one of the following locations for your testing:

General users
EB2230D
EB2778B
EB0504P
EB4857

Traders and developers only please
EB2904E 
EB3067
EB3138B

You may contact your floor support representative for any testing assistance.

I think we need for this to be reciprocal -although I agree the errors are=

Hi Mark-

Hope all is well. 

Attached you will find an e-mail that I sent to Alan regarding ISDA 
documentation, for which I need approval from Houston.  Alan has informed me 
that he left you a voicemail on this subject and I was hoping you could 
provide me with guidance as to whom I should contact to obtain approval.

By separate e-mail, I will be forwarding weather derivative GTC's for use on 
EOL with Enron Japan Corp. as the Enron counterparty.  Please also advise who 
I should be in contact with to obtain the requisite approval for these GTC's, 
as well.

Best regards,

John

		 Subject: ISDA Documents 

Alan-

Attached hereto, are marked-up copies of the following ISDA documents (based 
on the US versions) which have been prepared using the credit worksheet for 
The Mitsui Marine & Fire Insurance Co., Limited, in conjunction with B&M:

ISDA Schedule,
CSA and
Enron Corp. Guarantee.

The footnotes will disappear when the changes to the document are accepted.  
It will be relatively straight forward to revise these for other 
counterparties
such as IBJ and Sanwa, which apparently have the same credit rating.  I note 
that we have not yet received the credit work sheet for IBJ or Sanwa.

Please note:

1.  There are still a number of "options" in the documents which I have not 
completed as I am unsure as to the desired outcome.  These are indicated in 
square
brackets.  Please let me know how you would like to deal with these;

2.   It will be important to make sure that the documents are carefully 
checked to ensure that we have properly incorporated the various elections in 
the documents;

3.   The agreements are governed by New York law and we should ensure that 
appropriate counsel reviews same;and

4.   A number of features in the agreements (particularly the requirement for 
a legal opinion and the use of L/Cs as form of collateral) are not common in
Japan and are likely to meet resistance from our counterparties.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Best regards,

John

Subject: new counterparties for EOL?

Louise - I think that John indicated to me that he had or would be suggesting 
to you that hedge funds might be a group of counterparties to get online with 
EOL.  I have also suggested to John, and pass along to you now, an 
additional/different group.  Lately, I have been receiving proxies from a 
number of the mutual funds (the equivalent of your unit trusts and investment 
trusts in the UK) I own (some with the Fidelity funds family in Boston, some 
with the AIM funds, based in Houston [but with a UK parent]), seeking (and 
receiving) shareholder authorisation to trade in commodities.  Particularly 
given the cost pressures on mutual funds these days, the low-cost option of 
EOL would seem a good product for them.  Anyway, in the event that you had 
not targetted this potentially large number of counterparties and funds, I 
wanted to pass along this suggestion/idea.  Hope all is going well.  mcs

Tana,

Before Carol St. Clair left for maternity leave, she was working on the 
assignment of some financial and gas deals with Christopher Smith (who 
previously worked in our group).  Since Christopher is no longer here and 
with Carol being out, I'm scrambling to find out who in the financial team is 
working on this.

I've left Mark Taylor a message since Carol's voice mail forwards all 
questions to Mark.

Could you let me know if you have any info?

Thx,
Tracyh

Sara,

Please contact either Paul Radous or me on credit derivatives in the U.S.  
Rod Nelson is the lead credit support for EnronCredit.com and should also be 
available in London, if necessary.  I am not aware of these recent trades but 
I am having lunch with Jeff Kinneman on Thursday to discuss among other 
things Credit support for his business.  

It does concern me that we would offer to provide collateral DLJ without 
Treasury's approval.

Subject: Credit Derivatives

I am seeing more and more credit derivatives.  The trades originating in 
Houston are coming from Jeff Kinneman's bond/debt traders but are booked in 
the name of ECT Investments, Inc. or ENA.  I can't be certain if these are 
backed to EnronCredit.com Limited.  

In particular, there is a proposed total return bond trade with DLJ 
International Capital requiring ECT Investments to post collateral.  We have 
no master with this party.  Who in Houston credit  is looking at credit 
derivatives?

FYI, other credit deals seem to be transacted wtih Deutsche Bank and UBS AG.

Subject: Aluminium Trading



Dear Marcus

Please find our advice attached.  Unfortunately we have found it not very
practicable to send a compare version but you may wish to run a compare 
yourself
as against the draft previously sent.  The main changes are in relation to the
Commodities Exchange Law.

In short, there should be no CEL problems with respect to trading of physical
aluminium, offshore or through a subsidiary in Japan, but there is a risk that
trading of aluminium futures will be deemed to be "facility" in breach of the
CEL, which danger is increased if the activities are conducted by a subsidiary
in Japan.

We have not of course at this stage reviewed any derivatives documentation.

Let me know if we can help further.

Best regards

Paul Davis

Hello Mr. Taylor:

I wasn't sure if your voice mail was working so I decided to e-mail you
regarding the TULA Conference in October.  Time is running short and Mr.
Suggs needs to get the TULA Papers approved, and I was wondering what the
status is on your papers.

Please feel free to e-mail me at WhiteS@EpEnergy.com or call me at
713-420-6796.

Thank you,

Susan White

Further to Louise's suggestion:

On selecting "Create Price Limit Order" from the submission window, a link 
should appear titled "How Price Limit Orders Work". Suggest a location 
immediately below the bar containing the "Create Submission" and "Create 
Price Limit Order" buttons.

When this link is pressed, a popup window should appear containing the 
following text:

Price Limit Orders allow you to place an offer to buy or sell at a price 
which is not currently available. If the price you specified becomes 
available on EnronOnline, the system will automatically try to fill your 
submission and a transaction may result.  Your submission may be filled 
partially or completely depending on the volume available. This submission 
will remain active until the earlier of (i) the expiration of the hours and 
minutes you specify in your submission, (ii) Your cancellation (by 
highlighting the submision and pressing the cancel button on the main 
screen), or (iii) the end of the day. The submission  will not be withdrawn 
by your logout. Price limit orders are processed automatically by price and 
then by timestamp. Therefore, if other price limit orders for the same price 
have been submitted before yours, then they will be filled before your 
submission is filled. This can result in other transactions completing at the 
same price as your price limit order, while your price limit order does not 
complete.

How do you want us to handle the price limit order submission text?  See 
Mark's e-mail below.  I believe in the meeting this afternoon we talked about 
reducing the amount of text in the submission screen and creating a link to a 
separate section for the remainder of the information.

Dave - my comments are below in red.  I'm assuming that "end of the day" is 
the end of the trading day, but this seems a bit ambiguous since the trader 
in Japan may be thinking about a different "day" than the trader in London, 
etc.  Will the orders be cancelled if our trader removes a product during the 
day and then reactivates it?

Mark,

Further to our conversation today; How is this?

You have offered a price limit order for aaa mmbtus of yyyyy at a price of 
xxx. If the price you specified becomes available on EnronOnline, the system 
will automatically try to fill your submission and a transaction may result.  
Your submission may be filled partially or completely depending on the volume 
available. This submission will remain active until for the earlier of (i) xx 
hours and yy minutes from your submission, or  (ii) until you cancel it (by 
highlighting it and pressing the cancel button on the main screen), or (iii) 
the end of the day. The submission  will not be withdrawn by your logout. 
Price limit orders are processed by price and then by timestamp. Therefore, 
if other price limit orders for the same price have been submitted before 
yours, then they will be filled before your submission is filled. This can 
result in other transactions completing at the same price as your price limit 
order, while your price limit order does not complete.

Mark, Kristina, and Carol,

In the past few months (before Carol went on maturity leave) I have been 
communicating with Carol on possible positions available at Enron.  Due to 
the Moratorium that was in place here at Azurix, unfortunately, I could not 
speak to anyone at Enron in reference to possible employment opportunities.  
The Azurix Board has lifted the moratorium as of August 7, 2000 and due to 
the present situation here at Azurix, I would greatly appreciate the 
opportunity to speak to each of you of any positions that are open in your 
area or of possible leads to other groups that can use a candidate who is 
detail oriented and possess strong analytical,  communication and 
interpersonal skills and proficient when it comes to ethical and professional 
responsibilities within the corporate arena.  

Thank you for reviewing my resume and I hope to be speaking to each of you in 
the future.  Many thanks, Barb

I know this will cause delays, but this agency does not have authority to

authority.  I have attached 2 files.  One is with the changes highlighted and 
the other is a clean copy of what we would be willing to sign.  Please let me

I have created the following new Product Types in the Data Manager:

AUS CDD Swap
AUS HDD Swap
JPN CDD Swap
JPN HDD Swap

These are exactly the same as the existing AUS and JPN Weather Swap Product 
Types which you have previously approved with the exception that they have 
been created with the trading entity as Enron North America and will be 
denominated in USD. The intention is to give the seperate Weather desks the 
ability to transact weather around the clock. The transactions will be 
denominated in the domicile currency, thereby avoiding dual taxation 
consequences.

Please go into the DataManager and offer your respective approval.

Dale

Jon,

I had a glance over the written paper from Sullivan & Cromwell as to FX 
Transactions, and it seems to me that there would be fewer US regulatory 
issues (should there be any), if we were to use MG Brokers Inc, the FCM 
entity.  Are there any other reasons why we would not want to use this entity?

[Mark/Alan/Marcus - I have separately sent you by email the Sullivan & 
Cromwell paper]

Thanks.

absence.  Please follow up with Mark to advise re the status of Italy, Norway 
and Sweden (and any other countries that we may be able to move to the 
"Approved List.")  Also, please confirm that for the purpose of screening 
individuals who should not play the game, the appropriate question is 
"Country of Residence."

I don't think we're going to be interested in reimbursing for connection 
costs so I think we should just keep France in the lists of "not approved."

With regard to the data protection issue, I have actually sent Justin an 
e-mail on this various issue to determine if our current legal & privacy 
language is sufficient or if we need additional language in the rules.  I 
will forward you that e-mail.  If you go into the Registration Screen of the 
demo game, you will see that individual participants will be required to 
enter their name, e-mail, address and telephone number.

I look forward to your comments on this issue.

 Dear Leslie


France
I have now read through the French advice.  The DGCCRF (lottery regulators)
have confirmed that a game offered on a website may well be regarded as
involving a financial contribution due to the cost of Internet
communication.  This means that the game probably does fall foul of French
lottery legislation.   One way round this might be to offer to reimburse
connection costs.  If this is done, then there are still a couple of
"indirect contribution" issues to sort out (these relate to being seen not
to promote Enron, and so may fall away as in other jurisdictions, although
French law on these matters is generally stricter).  There is also a
possibility that a bailiff needs to be appointed  to adjudicate in the case
of disupute, but I get the impression from the French advice that this could
probably be got round by further discussing the matter with the DGCCRF.

Is offering to reimburse connection costs feasible? - if it isn't then,
there is presumably little point in "tidying up" the indirect contribution"
and "bailiff" issues.

The game will not be a lottery if no prize is awarded i.e. there must be an
expectation of profit/gain. Hence in theory,  not awarding the prize to a
French resident should allow the game to be played in France.  The French
lawyers seemed to have concerns about how this could be done practically - I
am not sure I understand their concerns, and have asked them for
clarification.  I assume that Enrons French customers are French companies,
and that we would need to exclude employees of such companies, together with
employees of other Enron Customers (for example UK companies) who happen to
reside in France. I have asked our colleagues in France for clarification
that such exclusions would suffice, and will forward you the essence of
their replies.



I set out  below a list of countries where the game would be lawful,
providing prizes are not awarded to residents of that country.

Netherlands
Belgium
Sweden
[France] - subject to clarification of our French lawyers concerns
Italy

As mentioned in my previous e-mail, some of these countries may move into
the "approved" list anyway.  I have not received express advice on this
particular issue from Norway - but there advice implies that not awarding
prizes would be ok, and if the tax issue scan be sorted out, Norway may move
to the approved list anyway.  I will however ask them to confirm the "not
awarding prizes" point for completeness.  I have not received advice on this
point from Spain.

You may recall that for the Euro 2000 game, colleagues in Belgium were
concerned that if prizes are not to be awarded to Belgium residents, then
this needs to be made very clear from an early stage, so that Enron are not
misleading partcipants of that country into thinking that they will be
awarded a prize if they are not going to be.  If ineligbility for prizes is
placed prominently in the rules, and partcipants have to read the rules
before playing, then I  guess that this covers this issue.  Although none of
the advice from the other jurisdictions has mentioned this point, I think it
would apply anywhere where partcipants cannot be awarded prizes.


Countries where Enron could avoid liability by using disclaimers pointing
out that residents of that particular country cannot play and by having an
online registration process are:

Spain (based on previous Euro 2000 advice)
Italy
Netherlands
Denmark
Sweden

Belgium - but note the comments made re Euro 2000 that there is a very
slight chance that an online registartion process might raise evidential
difficulties i.e. Enron might not be able to prove in a court that Belgium
participants had been properly advised of their ineligibility.  Belgium law
requires written proof of such terms in contracts with consumers.

Rules

I have not had chance to review the rules in detail.  One issue that may be
important from a European point of view is data protection i.e. protection
of personal data including names and addresses of partcipants and consent to
trnsfer data - I will look into this and let you know.  As mentioned above,
the inelegibility of residents of certain jurisdictions for prizes will need
to be included in the "eligibility" section.

Miscellaneous

One issue which was touched upon in a previous e-mail was whether the word
"Olympic" could be used in a disclaimer.  I will look into this further and
get back to you on this matter next week.  As requested, I will summarize
the Olympic advice for you also.

Regards

Rachel

I recently joined Jeff Kinneman's group and have been asked to participate in 
the evaluation of various internet trading platforms.  Is your area reviewing 
agreements / legal issues related to the Buy Side Direct site or its parent 
Intelligent Markets ?  Could I get an update on the status of this review and 
any outstanding issues ?

Thanks.

Subject: New Secretary of Energy in Argentina

This is to inform you that Montamat was replaced in the Secretariat of Ener=
gy=20
by the former Secretary of Industry, Debora Giorgi.
The new Secretary does not have former experience in the Energy sector. She=
=20
is economist and used to work in a consulting company.
Giorgi has the confidence of her boss, the Minister of Economy, Jos, Luis=
=20
Machinea. Montamat did not have that trust, since he belonged to other=20
political group, lead by the Minister-Chief of Cabinet, Rodolfo Terragno.
It is considered that the movement in the governmet was due to the followin=
g=20
in the stated order:

1. The need to improve economic expectations by bringing on board a private=
=20
sector leader as Secretary of Industry (Javier Tizado, comes from Techint, =
an=20
important private group of Argentina). Among other things, Techint is an=20
steel company with assets in gas transportation and distribution, and is=20
against opening the energy market to greater competition. However, it is=20
considered that Tizado would not try to go back to protectionist policies, =
at=20
least to a great extent. Tizado=01,s agenda includes: a) a right of first=
=20
refusal for domestic producers in the purchases of the government and=20
privatized companies (at equal price and quality, they should purchase from=
 a=20
national producer); b) to extend the term for small and medium companies to=
=20
pay public services.

2. The inclusion of Tizado in the government created the need to move Debor=
a=20
Giorgi.

3. So Machinea needed a place for Giorgi, and suggested De la R?a to fire=
=20
Montamat.

4. De la R?a would have accepted to fire Montamat with the purpose of: a)=
=20
reducing the power of the Chief of Cabinet; b) confirming to the market=20
Machinea=01,s power (Machinea has been the object of strong rumours of=20
resignation during last weeks).=20

So the replacement of Montamat is mainly the consequence of an intent of=20
including Tizado in the economic team to show the government=01,s commitmen=
t=20
with industrial growth (you must have in mind that the main critic to the=
=20
government is that it gave a huge importance to the fiscal goal, forgeting=
=20
other goals as economic growth). In a lower extent, the replacement of=20
Montamat by someone without experience (Giorgi) is oriented to keep the=20
position for one member of Machinea=01,s team and to avoid the nomination o=
f=20
someone from another political group, with own ideas.

Among the implication of the nomination of Giorgi, it should be mentioned:
1. The new secretary will probably be more sensitive to any measure that=20
implies a cost reduction for industries. This is positive, since we are=20
suggesting several measures with this goal.
2. Since she does not have a background on energy, it will be very valuable=
=20
to lobby not only her but other Machinea=01,s team members who can influenc=
e her.
3. On one side, she has a reduced value since she has been moved and replac=
ed=20
by someone stronger. On the other, she has a higher value since from now on=
,=20
it will be clear that her voice is Machinea=01,s voice.
4. Enargas=01, President, Formica, can lose political support, since he bel=
ongs=20
to the group of Montamat and Terragno.
5. On the power side we will probably see a delay in the implementation of=
=20
the regulatory changes we are advocating for, and that we had already agree=
d=20
upon with Montamat=01,s team.
6. Any policy change implying a price increase will have a lower probabilit=
y=20
of success. Machinea=01,s team is highly concerned about energy prices for=
=20
end-users. So we have to be ready to prove that under the full unbunling of=
=20
energy industries prices will not increase (even after paying stranded cost=
s).

Attached are the CV of Debora Giorgi and Javier Tizado in Spanish.

Regards.
Guillermo

Today Paul and myself met with Ted Kerr and Martin James both partners at 
Mallesons concerning the attached Request For  Proposal from ISDA. It relates 
to  the possible development of an online site where electronic versions of 
ISDA documentation could be accessed. There would be some other functionality 
that would include a document negotiation,  processing/execution and storage 
facility.    

I understand the RFP was issued following an approach by Mallesons to ISDA 
earlier this year. Apparently  whilst the ISDA Board was enthusiastic about 
the idea and a demonstration website Mallesons had produced they thought it 
appropriate to invite other proposals.

Mallesons is preparing an initial response to the RFP (due on 8  Sept) and 
wanted to know if Enron was interested in collaborating. Our reputation in 
the finance idustry, experience with online contracting and strong presence 
in e-commerce  they see as a good fit with their skills.     Paul sees some 
real potential and will be (or perhaps is already) talking to Networks. The 
commercial interest primarliy relates to the "deal room" concept that would 
require significant data storage data/transportation.

I wanted to acquaint you as soon as possible with this approach to check 
whether Enron is involved in any other responses to the ISDA RFP. I note Mark 
H. was a recipient of the RFP email and would be aware of this initiative. 
Also as  the opportunities for Legal to bring in an e-commerce business 
opportunity are rare it  would be a pity if we did not make every effort to 
promote this one within Enron. Accordingly any observations you would have 
would be greatly appreciated.

MEMORANDUM TO ISDA PRIMARY CONTACTS

ISDA has undertaken an initiative to produce its documentation in electronic
form.  In connection with that effort ISDA has considered other ways in
which the preparation, negotiation and execution of ISDA documents might be
facilitated.

ISDA is close to completing the process of converting all of its documents
to electronic form. Further details about that development will be provided
shortly and will be highlighted at our upcoming member updates in September.


The Association is now seeking proposals for a document preparation,
negotiation and execution facility.  Attached please find the request for
proposal that outlines the and specifications and requirements for proposals
for a documentation negotiation facility.

ISDA is sending this request for proposal to the Primary Contact at each of
its member firms in the event that their firm is interested in developing
this facility or knows of a third party that might be interested in
providing this service.  Please feel free to forward the request for
proposal to any firms that may be interested in submitting a proposal.

I can be reached by telephone on 212 332 2554 or by email at
rpickel@isda.org should you have any questions.

Mark:  (1)  Did you consider my voice mail about updating authorized trader 
lists and resolutions (by Samantha or Tana)?

(2)  Have you thought about electronic notice provisions?  Shouldn't 
default/termination notices be in writing to the appropriate counsel/Corp. 
secretary?  And, can we agree to "electronic notices" at all?  There is no 
electronic address for a Documentation Desk or Assistant General Counsel.  I 
am seeing this type of provision in electronic trading agreements.

Thanks.  Sara

Mark: 

Implementation of the EOL project in Brazil had been postponed for a while 
because of regulatory matters. The Market Rules were still being discussed 
and had not been approved by ANEEL, making it impossible for us to implement 
EOL, from a regulatory standpoint. Recently (about a couple of weeks ago), 
ANEEL issued Resolution 290/00, approving the Market Rules, subject to 
certain amendments. The amendments will be implemented in stages over the 
course of the next few years. After Resolution 290 was issued and the 
regulatory issues were partially resolved, the EOL team decided to work on 
the project again. I am now in the course of adapting the ETA, GTC and 
Password Application for use in Brazil. I will probably have drafts for 
comments within the next 10 days. I am not sure about the time estimate for 
completion of the project as a whole. I believe Remi can give you a better 
idea of the schedule.

I will forward to you in a separate e-mail the legal opinion that we received 
from outside counsel, addressing the issues in the memo prepared by your 
team. Also, I take the opportunity to let you know that I am leaving Enron by 
the end of August. From September on, the contact people for the EOL project 
will be Remi and Ricardo on the commercial side, and Sami Arap on the legal. 
In the meantime, please feel free to contact me if I can be of any further 
assistance.

TAIWAN BANKS SET TO ENTER SWAP MARKET FOR CHEAP DOLLAR FUNDS.  
Taiwan-based banks are planning to exploit the ballooning interest rate

TAIWAN REGULATORY CHANGE GOOD FOR FOREIGN BANKS. 
Recent regulatory changes in Taiwan will likely be a boon for foreign banks

Subject: Metals Brokers on EnronOnline

Hi Guys

As you are aware some of the metals counterparties we have heard from conduct 
two types of business:

- proprietary trading for own book
- brokerage for customers

It has been decided to give such metals brokers only, access to metals 
products on EnronOnline for trading purposes.

Can you please let me know whether you have any specific reasons why we 
should not go ahead with this course of action.

Be aware that some of these brokers will be clearing their business through 
LCH.  This would entail tagging deals with such counterparties in the back 
office systems and relabelling the cpy as LCH.

Look forward to hearing from you.

Regards

Amita

  Mark Taylor: This is the comment letter I referred to; see the top of page
4. I am also faxing this to you and also Mark Haedicke, who will I am sure
be just as disgusted as you are; they argue in effect that single-entity
internet sites such as EnronOnline should be treated as Multilateral
Transaction Execution Facilities, and therefore they would also be caught up
in the requirement to register with the CFTC as DTFs.

I think if once you get full access  you could have your assistant plug in 
the required data for on each ISDA Master in place or draft you have out to 
counterparties.  When you come here I would like to spend just a little time 
going over some of the data and the reporting funtions.  I am going to open 
an Enron counterparty called short name "Enron Australia" and that should be 
the code name you should use.  Please do not change the entries on any of the 
Houston or London based counterparties.

   I fully endorse Mark's suggestion to load up our ISDAs. A worldwide data 
dase of this nature is a valuable resource.  I have access to the data base 
and refer it. Getting our contracts on is on my to do list. What is the best 
way forward.   Yes I will be over in October, I fact I will staying a month. 
However, if there is anything we can do to get info loaded up sooner? We are 
most willing to put in the resources.

When access is being granted could it also be given to my Admin assistant 
Alison Keogh and also Rob McGrory who is also working under my direction on 
ISDA documentation.

Thanks for taking the initative on this matter.

Subject: Financial Trading Legal Database

David,

Mark Taylor asked me to talk to you about getting your ISDA Masters inputted 
into our Financial Trading Database.  This databse is the central master 
database where we keep records of the financial agreements in either draft 
form or that have been executed.  London currently updates this database to 
manage  its (and Singapore's) financial contracts and I would like to get the 
Australian agreements plugged into the system.

This database serves a number of purposes.  First, it is our core memory of 
contract negotiations.  Anyone in Legal and Credit around the world can take 
a look at this database and determine who we have entered into contract with 
and what negotiation issues may be at issue.  It is critical as we become a 
global trading company that we are consistent in the legal positions we take 
on these financial contracts.  For instance, it would be quite problematic if 
someone in Houston was negotiating a contract with an ISDA counterparty and 
asserted that a certain position was critical, if we find out a lawyer in 
another office was negotiating with the same counterparty and gave on the 
same position the day before.  We need to make a somewhat coordinated effort 
on the counterparty front.

In addition, with so many masters and so many counterparties there is just no 
way to keep track of what we have said or done unless we have a database.

Further, we use the information in the database to respond to inside 
auditing, reporting and insurance inquiries.

For online trading, I check the database to see if we have a financial master 
agreement and what trading restrictions we may or may not have in place. 
Global contracts uses this database to confirm their financial contract 
records and approval for online trading.

For both Houston and London we use the database to communicate with our 
Clients, whether traders or  back office support people.  Employees outside 
legal have  limited view access only to see all the information except the 
confidential Legal and Credit comments.  They have no edit capabilities.  The 
database also has some reporting functions that we and London Legal have 
found helpful.

You should have gotten my email to Mike Neves, out database coordinator 
requesting full edit access for you.  It usually takes a few days.  Once you 
get access maybe you could find some time to surf the database, and we can 
figure out how to get your ISDA data inputted..

Are you coming to the ENA Legal Conference in October?  That would be a good 
time for me to do a full review of this database with you.

Mark:

I am the writer that is developing the online help guide for the EnronOnIine 
system.  I work for Dave Forster.  Dave wanted to make sure that you have an 
opportunity to review the online help guide before we go live.  My 
understanding is that you have access to the test web.  The work in progress 
help guide is on the website but is by no means a finished product; it 
changes as screens and labels change.  Are you currently reviewing the online 
help or do I need to advise you when it is considered final?  Please let me 
know if you have a preferred way of reviewing this sort of thing. Thanks,

Laura J

Gary, Trena,

The key points are:

1. Any FX business conducted from London must in most cases be done by or 
through a specifically authorised SFA-regulated entity.  None of the MG 
London entities is authorised to conduct this type of business.  The choices 
therefore are:

- Set up a new SFA-regulated entity specifically authorised to carry on this 
type of business (up to 6  months to implement)

- Change the current authorisation of the regulated MG London entities to 
permit this type of business (this would involve a material change to its 
current  authorisation )

- Consider using Enron Europe Finance & Trading Limited ("EEFT"), which is 
SFA-regulated.  However, the approval of SFA would be required to   extend 
the scope of its current SFA authorisation to include this type of 
business.   Note also that EEFT Enron Europe Finance & Trading Limited   
currently acts as agent only and not as principal - this is primarily for 
regulatory capital reasons for unregulated entity.  Any proposed extension 
of   EEFT's current authorisation must also be carefully considered in the 
light of the potential increased risk of consolidated supervision from a 
regulatory  capital perspective.

2. Enron carries on all of its current investment business with commercial 
enterprises, and not private individuals.  And there are good reasons for 
this.  From a legal and regulatory perspective, this exposes Enron to fewer 
potential risks and to a significantly lower degree of regulatory 
compliance.  If Enron were to carry on this business with private 
individuals, this would materially increase the level of regulatory 
compliance; it also may give the individual additional rights of recourse 
against Enron for breach of its regulatory duties, and could also expose 
Enron to a greater risk of potential claims as to existence of a special or 
fiduciary relationship between itself and the private individual.  There 
would therefore need to be an overwhelming commercial rationale to support 
the decision to take on private individuals as customers.

Justin

Travis, Mark,

Please see below advice regarding paper swaps with Czech C/Ps.  However, this 
advice applies to all OTC derivatives trades whatever the underlying 
commodity.  We will need to keep a close eye on the new law (expected to come 
into force January 2001) to determine whether we will need to be separately 
licenced.

Regards

Justin

Subject: FX Transactions

We received the attached from Sullivan & Cromwell re the FX business and the 
possibilities of using a US companyn which company to use for contract 
purposes. At a meeting here at MG today, the consensus/preference was not to 
use a UK company as we have no full ISD (chapter 10) firm nor the wish to 
change MG's status.

Per the advice from S&C, we like the idea of using a US corporation with a UK 
"arranger" to cover any UK regulatory issues that arise. Dependent on where 
the business will end up (I understand to be discussed by Gary Hickerson/Mike 
Hutchinson 18th August), the following appears to be the among the logical 
solutions:

1. Contractual entity - either Enron North America, MG London Inc or Newco 
Inc.
2. Arranger - either EEFT Ltd, Metallgesellschaft Ltd or MG Brokers Ltd 
(depending on the effect on their chapter 3 status for the last two).

The current customer base consists of entities in the US, Canada, France, UK 
and Switzerland.

Please advise on any group/tax issues that can affect the final decision. If 
you need any further information, please let me know.

Many thanks.

We have tentatively planned for two partners from the Chicago law firm of 
Sidley & Austin to come visit us in our offices on Friday, Aug. 11 and to 
give a presentation.  I say "tentatively" because I have not yet been able to 
confirm Mark Haedicke's availability on that date -- I will try to do that as 
soon as possible.

I would expect the presentation to take 1 to 2 hours -- I'm sure it could 
take longer if we wanted it to, i.e., if there turned out to be some matters 
that we wanted to discuss in further detail with them.  I think a morning 
meeting would suit most people's availability better than an afternoon one; 
please share your thoughts on this with me.

Enclosed is a rough outline of an agenda I have suggested to them for their 
presentation.  If there are other matters you would like to hear them 
discuss, I encourage you to let me know; I will pass all suggestions along to 
them.

As most of you probably know, attorneys have a duty of strict confidentiality 
to their clients, and this duty attaches from the moment a consultation 
begins (regardless of whether a formal "engagement" has commenced).  
Violation of this duty is grounds for disciplinary action by the governing 
bar association.   On the other hand, I realize that we do not have an 
established relationship with this firm or these lawyers.  All of that being 
said, I will leave it to each of you as to your comfort level in asking 
particular questions or sharing particular information.

I think 5% is way too small. At certin physical locations for both gas and 
power, a 5% move is easily achievable in the normal course of business i.e. 
35 mwh power to 45mwh or Transco Z6 from 5.00 to 5.50 in the next trade. I 
think something in the neighborhood of 20% to 25% is
commercially reasonable.

Hi Mark,

We are currently talking with Natsource about offering them transaction ID's 
to transact on behalf of other counterparties on EOL. We were thinking of 
approaching other brokers to offer them this servie. Are there any legal 
repercussions of only offering it to certain brokers? WOuld we be obliged to 
offer the service to all the brokers if we offered it to some of them?

Attached is the last version of the memorandum from Pinheiro Neto addressing 
the questionnaire prepared by Mark Taylor. I suggest that we all take a look 
at it and identify questions and areas that we would like PN to expand or 
further explain. We could then schedule a conference call to share our 
thoughts and define next steps. I will be out of the office Monday through 
Wednesday next week. Thursday and Friday are holidays in Brazil. Please let 
me know how your schedule looks like from the 26th on so we can schedule 
something. Thanks.

To all,

One of our customers, ALCOA, has been registered on EOL for the OTC metal 
products, but is having problems accessing the trading site.

The problem stems from two areas:

1) When ALCOA accesses the trading site,  the prompt for Enron's terms and 
conditions comes up with a further prompt to agree or disagree to the 
conditions.  ALCOA's legal team has determined that they should not agree to 
the conditions because they have an existing ISDA agreement in place with MG 
Ltd.

2) ALCOA has talked to EOL's help desk (specifically Kathy Moore), who 
subsequently has determined (I assume with Enron legal) that the current ISDA 
in place with MG Ltd. is sufficient to begin trading EOL's OTC metal products.

In further discussions I had with Mark Taylor today,  he basically confirmed 
that the ISDA that's in place is valid for EOL's OTC metal products, but said 
that I should confirm with either Edmund Cooper or Justin Boyd in London for 
final confirmation of the legal questions, and Frank Davis for the EOL access.

In addition, Mark alluded to the probability that Enron legal/compliance does 
not have a listing and/or copies of ISDA's that MG Ltd. has in place with 
customers.  If you'd like, I can help facilitate that.  Please advise.

Could you confirm for me the following via telephone and/or e-mail:

1) That the current ISDA ALCOA has in place is valid for EOL's OTC metal 
product trading.

2) That their account can access the site without the term and conditions 
prompt.

Please contact me if you have any further questions or concerns.

Regards,
BEF

Clement-

I am temporarily based in Tokyo and have been working with Mark Taylor to put 
together our ISDA related documentation for use in Japan with Japanese 
counterparties.  

With regard to the Enron Corp. guaranty, it is believed that utilizing New 
York law, as opposed to Texas law, may be more palatable (based on local 
market practice) for the Japanese counterparties.  Therefore, I would like to 
obtain your view in doing so.  Attached hereto, is a draft of the guaranty 
for your reference (this particular draft has been prepared for The Mitsui 
Marine and Fire Insurance Co., Limited).

Thank you for your kind attention to this matter.

Best regards,

John Viverito

Subject: Re: Foreign Exchange from a US entity  

David

The US entity we're considering at the moment is an FCM, regulated by the 
CFTC and which is a member of NYMEX/COMEX. It currently clears the NY 
exchanges metals business for the group. It will probably be utilised to 
clear the NY exchange energy business following the Enron tie up. It may 
assist in clearing CSCE business but is unlikely at this stage to be looking 
to be a CSCE exchange member. 

It currently has capital of $2 million and subordinated debt of $20 million. 
Profits are generally paid out in the form of a dividend so although it may 
have a small amount of retained profit it won't be material. Currently it has 
about $10 million of regulatory capital requirements.

Depending on your advice, we may consider an un-regulated company with, at 
the moment, not very much capital. This latter point could be rectified, 
either with subordinated debt or capital injection. The EFP customer 
facilities (approximately 50% of the business) may prohibit this.

I hope this is enough info.

Best regards.

Jon

Thanks.  I will prepare a memo.  One question on your e-mail -- can you give 
me a bit more information about the US entity that will be the FX dealer?  
For example, is it currently regulated in any respect?  Is it, or will it be, 
engaged in any other businesses?  How large is it in terms of assets or net 
worth?  Thanks.  I'll get back to you soon.

Further to our recent telephone conversation, we would be grateful if you 
would
give us a brief written summary on the regulatory and/or legal issues 
governing
a US corporation transacting foreign exchange with US and non-US customers. My
basic understanding of our telephone conversation was that, as a non-bank,
neither the Fed, the SEC nor the CFTC have any jurisdiction. However the
Commodities Exchange Act prohibits us from contracting with certain types of
counterparties.

The potential business we are looking at currently covers outright foreign
exchange with counterparties such as banks, securities houses, funds, 
corporates
and, possibly, high net worth individuals. The business also covers the
provision of EFP facilities for these customers whereby they ultimately 
receive
a currency futures position on the IMM division of the CME or on FINEX. This
latter area is one where, from the Exchanges' points of view, we would
effectively be acting as an executing broker.

I hope this brief description is enough for you to be able to respond but if 
you
have any questions or would like further clarification, you can contact me by
e-mail or by telephone on +44 20 7265 5421.

Thank you for your help in this.

Kind regards.

Hydro Quebec is not only a provincial utility, it is owned by the Government 
of Quebec and its business and affairs will be governed by Quebec civil law 
(all other jurisdictions in Canada are common law jurisdictions) which is 
generally foreign to non-Quebec lawyers.  Also, unless you are uniquely 
successful at your negotiations, I expect that HQ will insist on the 
guarantee being governed by Quebec law.  Accordingly, I agree that Quebec 
counsel should be involved in looking at the guarantee and isues of 
authority, capacity, execution, delivery, enforceability, etc.  In fact a 
legal opinion may be appropriate.

As to Quebec counsel, I would suggest the following:

1.  Andre Vautour @ Desjardins Ducharme Stein Monast in Montreal @ 
514.878.5595.  Andre acted for us us the Papier Mason transaction and I would 
recommend him to you.
2.  Xeno Martis @ Fasken Martineau DuMoulin in Montreal @ 514.397.7509.  Xeno 
acted for Bank of Nova Scotia on our financing of the Papier Masson 
transaction and I would also recommend him to you.
3.  Fred Erickson at Stikeman Elliott in Calgary (who is well known to Mark 
T) @ 403.266.9016.  Fred is located in Calgary, but he could refer you to 
someone in his firm's Montreal or Quebec City office.  I personally do not 
know anyone in particular at either Stikeman's Montreal or Quebec City 
offices.

Let me know if I can be of any assistance or how things turn out.

Regards, Peter.

1.  Attached to the forwarded e-mail below please find a link to the demo for 
the Five Flags Game.  Please note that this is still a work in progress.  We 
still need to prepare the "How to Play" section, for example.  Let me assure 
you that this Section and no other section in the game will include the term 
"Olympics" or any of the other protected terms that we have been advised to 
avoid from the various jurisdictions.  The front page of the game will 
include an express disclaimer to the effect of the following:  "The Enron 
Five Flags Down Under game has not been set up in collaboration with any 
parties, other than Internet Sports Network, Inc."

2.  I have attached a draft of the Official Rules for your review. The front 
page of the game will make clear that by electing to play the game, a 
participant acknowledges and agrees to be bound by the Official Rules.  
Please note that the rules make clear that only residents of certain 
specified jurisdictions are entitled to play.  The rules spell out that 
residents of Japan are entitled to play but are not eligible to receive 
prizes in excess of 100,000 yen.  Anne, please confirm that it is permissible 
for us to allow Japanese residence to play and to merely limit their 
eligibility for prize awards.  (There will be prizes available that are 
valued at approx. $5000-$10,000 USD, but if a Japanese resident won the grand 
prize, he/she would not be awarded such a prize.  Instead, in such a 
circumstance, a Japanese winner probably would be awarded one of the 
consolation prizes instead.)



3.  The game will not be promoted with fliers or other hard-copy marketing 
materials, after all.  Instead, the game will be promoted on the 
password-protected Trading Screen of EnronOnline.  (The game will NOT be 
promoted on the home page.)  All registered users of EnronOnline will be able 
to see the front page of the game, including residents of Canada, Australia, 
and any European country where participation in the game is prohibited.  

4.  The following disclaimer will be included (1) next to the initial 
hyperlink to the game on the EnronOnline website (to confirm that this is 
possible; (2) on the front page of the game; and (3) on the registration 
page.  "This game is only available to residents of A, B and C.  Furthermore, 
due to the operation of the law in Japan, we will be unable to award prizes 
whose value exceeds 100,000 Yen to Japanese residents."  The registration 
page will include a gating function that requires the participant to enter 
his/her country of residence or principal place of business.  PLEASE ADVISE 
AS TO NECESSARY FORM OF QUESTION -- e.g., country of residence vs. country 
where business with Enron is conducted  If the country selected is not an 
eligible jurisdiction, the participant will receive a message that he/she is 
ineligible to play the game due to regulatory restrictions in his/her country 
of residence and will not be able to play the game.

Rachel and Marly:  I need to finalize the list of eligible jurisdictions as 
soon as possible.  Here's what I have so far:

USA, excluding NY and Florida (Milbank is advising on US issues)
UK
Germany
Switzerland
Poland 
Austria.

I thought that Portugal was also in the "approved" category.  Please advise 
as to the status of Portugal, as well as other jurisdictions where we are 
awaiting approval.  If the demo is not sufficiently complete to facilitate 
the approval process, please notify Dave Samuels so that he can work with the 
developer to create a more substantially complete demo.

5.  From the Canadian and Australian perspective, I merely want to confirm 
that our disclaimer in (4) above is sufficient to protect Enron from 
liability in Canada and Australia, as applicable, to gaming laws.

I will be in the office through the morning of Tuesday, Aug. 29.  Thereafter, 
through September 9, I will be on vacation.  Mark Taylor will be finalizaing 
all matters relating to the game in my absence.  (His e-mail address is 
mark.taylor@enron.com and his phone number is (713) 853-7459.

I look forward to your comments.

Regards,

Leslie

these agreements on its behalf. It is the provision of a support service, in 
much the same way as the issue of trade confirmations, rather than the 
negotiation and conclusion of a trading transaction. Justin - can you arrange 
for a POA draft ?
Thanks
Janine

Janine,

The U.S. PA is executed on behalf of ENA, and not EPOL.   As for Aus. C/Ps, I 
don't know who the ETA Enron entity is.

The costs of the London PCG team will be allocated to the legal entities who 
benefit from their services under the provisions of the EnronOnline cost 
sharing agreement. Therefore there is no problem with the London based PCG 
team providing PA approval services in respect of Western Hemisphere and 
Australasian customers. The PA form itself is I think signed by EPOL for and 
on behalf of group undertakings which will include all group companies 
worldwide. Indeed, if we approve a PA form in respect of a European customer 
today, this European customer can still transact with non-UK entities 
(depending on the product transacted , and whether the customer has been 
approved to trade these products). Let me know if you think the procedure 
will work differently from that which I described. 

Congrats on the well deserved promotion.

Hi Guys

As the MG credit people sit in the London office we are considering amending 
the PA process for Western Hemisphere and Australasian customers.  All PAs 
received by the Houston and Sydney office from Metals customers will be 
forwarded to the London PCG team to process.  Part of the process includes 
signing of the relevant PA for the relevant Enron company.

Would we have tax/legal issues with having a London person authorised to sign 
these PAs on behalf of the relevant Enron companies?

Speedy response wd be appreciated!!

Thanks

Amita

Mark,

The above-referenced agreement would allow EnronOnline to obtain delayed Dow 
Jones data from Reuters.

Dow Jones has said that they cannot agree to arbitration.  I pointed out to 
them that they have agreed to it in the past (the content provider agreement 
that was executed earlier this summer b/t Dow Jones and Enron Net Works.

DJ has said that the previous deal was with "a different Dow Jones business" 
and that they can't agree to arbitration on this deal.

Please advise.

Jason

Mark: It was great to "meet" you this afternoon -- as a tech lawyer, I have 
been following? Enron's impressive on-line activities and nimble evolution as 
a true new economy company? . . . I? thought I? would mention that our 
Technology Group has worked on, and is currently involved in, a number of 
b-to-b exchanges, on behalf of both investors and technology providers 
(including the petroleum, chemicals and logistics industries). We have been 
actively involved in structuring, formation and financing issues in 
particular and have advised on technology, corporate, tax, employee benefit 
and IP issues as well. Please let me know if, as the ETE evolves, we can be 
of any assistance to you. You can reach me via e-mail or by phone at

Thanks for your quick response. My responses to the points you have raised 
are set forth in red below.

Upon receipt of IBJ's detailed comments, I will forward same for your review.

We have received preliminary comments back from IBJ relating to the draft  
ISDA documentation we recently provided to them.  IBJ appears unwilling to 
enter into a CSA with us.  Please review the traffic below, including Mark's 
comments.  Please provide your view as to how we should proceed on this point.

		 Subject: Re: IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENT

John - While we can delete Part 6 it then becomes necessary to add additional 
language in each confirmation which is not part of the templates for 
transactions used by the back office.  Each transaction would therefore 
require significant additional time and effort to prepare making it more 
cumbersome to do business with that counterparty.  There is no down-side to 
having the language in the master - the whole point of the master is that we 
agree to these things now so we don't have to deal with them at the confirm 
stage.  You can say "it's enough if the terms are referred to in the 
confirmation" for ALL of the terms of the master.  Since we would insist on 
the appropriate provisions being in the confirm in any event, if they have a 
problem with this language we need to know now what the problem is. I agree 
to all of the preceding points you have raised and really do not understand 
why IBJ would desire to delete these provisions. Once we receive all of their 
specific comments, we will require an explanation as to why these provisions 
are not acceptable.With respect to the CSA, that is an issue for Credit. I 
will forward this to John Suttle for his input.  It is certainly not 
necessary to have a valid agreement but it is necessary if you want to insist 
on collateral.  In this case, if IBJ is a stronger credit than Enron it may 
well be that the csa is more of a burden than a benefit.  Good point.  It 
strikes me as disingenuous to say that they don't have the internal systems 
for csa's with nonfinancial counterparties - the same systems would work for 
nonfinancial parties as well as financial parties.  IBJ is the most 
sophisticated Japanese player in the derivative market and one would believe 
that they could handle the documentation for both financial and non-financial 
entities.  I note, I have heard that it is not market practice for Japanese 
financial institutions to provide collateral to non-financial institutions, 
so it may be very difficult for them to alter their position.

Dear Mr.Viverito

Thank you very much.
Now we start checking your draft and maybe we can return comment on this
Friday.

Please be advised following points at this time.
1)Part 6 on the schedule is needed to be deleted.
  We think that it's enough if the terms in Part 6 are referred in the
individual confirmation.
2)ISDA Credit support annex is not acceptable
  Unfortunately, we don't have internal system for concluding CSA with
non-financial entity.

Please keep support us for concluding ISDA ASAP for our business in near
future.
If any question, please feel free to contact me.

I just received the ISN contract for the Olympics game.  Should I send a copy 
to Ed at Milbank as well?  Any reason Mark Holsworth needs to be involved?    
I have reviewed numerous license agreements and feel comfortable with many of 
the issues, but I do not hold myself out as an IP expert.  Have we entered 
into similar agreements with other content providers that would be good 
precedent for my review.

I am just stepping into a meeting and will try tracking you down once it's

Subject: Re: Hydro Quebec  

Hydro Quebec is not only a provincial utility, it is owned by the Government 
of Quebec and its business and affairs will be governed by Quebec civil law 
(all other jurisdictions in Canada are common law jurisdictions) which is 
generally foreign to non-Quebec lawyers.  Also, unless you are uniquely 
successful at your negotiations, I expect that HQ will insist on the 
guarantee being governed by Quebec law.  Accordingly, I agree that Quebec 
counsel should be involved in looking at the guarantee and isues of 
authority, capacity, execution, delivery, enforceability, etc.  In fact a 
legal opinion may be appropriate.

As to Quebec counsel, I would suggest the following:

1.  Andre Vautour @ Desjardins Ducharme Stein Monast in Montreal @ 
514.878.5595.  Andre acted for us us the Papier Mason transaction and I would 
recommend him to you.
2.  Xeno Martis @ Fasken Martineau DuMoulin in Montreal @ 514.397.7509.  Xeno 
acted for Bank of Nova Scotia on our financing of the Papier Masson 
transaction and I would also recommend him to you.
3.  Fred Erickson at Stikeman Elliott in Calgary (who is well known to Mark 
T) @ 403.266.9016.  Fred is located in Calgary, but he could refer you to 
someone in his firm's Montreal or Quebec City office.  I personally do not 
know anyone in particular at either Stikeman's Montreal or Quebec City 
offices.

Let me know if I can be of any assistance or how things turn out.

Tana-

For weather derivatives conducted by Enron North America with counterparties 
in Japan:

1.  There is a "relatively low risk" (quoting Baker & McKenzie) that such 
transactions will be considered gambling in Japan.  However, such risk is 
deemed to be even lower, when utilizing an offshore entity.  The risk has 
been determined to be sufficiently low to utilize Enron Japan Corp. as the 
Enron entity engaging in these transactions, therefore utilizing ENA should 
also be acceptable.

2.  I note, there will be foreign exchange reporting requirements for the 
Japanese counterparty to the transaction, both at the time the transaction is 
entered into and each time a payment is made (or netted).  There are no 
Japanese reporting requirements applicable to Enron North America.  Further, 
a default by the Japanese counterparty in compliance with its reporting 
requirements will not effect the enforceability of the transaction.

3.  I have copied Susan Musch on this correspondence, to obtain her input 
from the tax perspective.

Please let me know if you need anything further.

Cheers,

John

		 Subject: Japanese & Australian Products

You both may already by aware of this, but the online team has contacted me 
and it is their desire to have the Japanese & Australian products also 
offered out of the U.S. by Enron North America.  They would continue to be 
offered by their current companies, "Enron Australia" and "EnronJapan", but 
they want the products sold "24 hours a day" and I guess to do this they 
would be offered also by Enron North America.  Do you see any legal issues 
from your side with a your Japanese or Australia products being offered by 
Enron North America too?

Bryan/Tim - Please pass this note on to your teams.  Thanks.

Please note the new procedures set out below which have been agreed with 
Credit and Credit Trading and take effect immediately.

1.  Use of Enron Credit Ratings

ERatings can be used freely in pricing credit protection for reference 
entities where the ERating does not contain "confidential information" (this 
is defined in the Credit Trading Group's existing confidentiality/Chinese 
Walls procedures - please consult with Legal if the meaning of confidential 
information is unclear in a particular case). 

If the ERating does or may contain confidential information (which Credit 
Risk Management will flag in each case) then the rating can only be used with 
the prior authorisation of the Legal Department.  By way of general guidance, 
authorisation will not be granted where this would result in a clear breach 
of a confidentiality undertaking given by Enron, or where the reference 
entity is privately owned and there is little or no publicly available credit 
information about it.

2.  Restricted List Procedure 

The Restricted List is reviewed and, if necessary, updated by Legal at least 
once a fortnight.

The Restricted List is "unpublished", which means that the only person 
outside Legal who may see it is Bryan Seyfried.

Before a credit price for any new reference entity is published outside 
Enron, Bryan will check that that name does not appear on the Restricted 
List.  If it does, the price may not be published.

If you have any questions please contact myself or Michael Brown.

Best regards

Paul
