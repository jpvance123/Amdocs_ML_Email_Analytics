Joshua:  

I found the Enron staff who have had the conversations with the Oregon PUC so 
believe the attached Q&A meet your request.  If you need additional 
materials, just let me know.



In addition, EPSA sent some questions they would like the Senator to ask of 
any of the EPSA witnesses (Reliant, Calpine, Williams, or Enron) dealing with 
the Impact of the Recent changes in the Management of the California 
Independent System Operator:

Background:  The Cal ISO acts as the "air traffic controller" for the 
interstate electric power grid in California.  The ISO determines who gets 
access to the grid and under what terms and conditions.  It is the ISO that 
helps ensure that access to the grid is truly open and non-discriminatory.  
When the ISO was initially constituted several years ago, a "stakeholder" 
management board was created that represented a wide range of market 
interests---power sellers, generators, consumers, political leaders, etc.  
After the power emergencies began last summer, this board was criticized as 
too splintered and indecisive.  In a response to this perception and in an 
effort to impose greater control over the ISO, the California state 
legislature replaced the stakeholder board with a five-person board that 
serves at the request of the California Governor.

QUESTION:  The Cal ISO has recently seen its management board changed from 
one with broad stakeholder representation to one appointed by the California 
Governor.  Given that California is a critical part of a larger western 
regional power market, how can we ensure that regional power needs are 
reflected in the decisions of the new state appointed Board?

ANSWER:  We really can't.  Most of the time, the Board has a limited role.  
However, the "traffic controller" role becomes crucial when the power crunch 
comes.  Every market participant needs to be worried that, during times of 
real power emergencies, the Cal ISO Board will be too willing to shoot first 
and ask questions later.  Companies with firm transactions involving 
out-of-state entities may find their needs and commercial interests 
sacrificed to prevent local political problems.  Instead of robust, 
competitive regional markets, politicizing transmission decisions practically 
guarantees an increasingly balkanized market.

Attached is my draft revision to Alan's letter to Sen. Wyden on information 
release.  

I have already spoken to Josh Sheinkman in Sen Wyden's office about this 
issue and promised more detail as well as a face to face meeting with experts 
if necessary.  

Also, Chris Long just got a call from the Senator's office indicatiing that 
he wants to place a call to Skilling to discuss this issue.  Should we 
arrange a time for the call or avoid th emeeting.  I need to call back today.

One note: recall that with respect to market manipulation, one of the most
common accusations focused on the problems caused by the PX manipulation
the utilities engaged in thanks to their monopsony (demand-side bidding)
market power.

Steve Kean will be testifying at the Senate Energy Committee's hearing on
Wednesday regarding California.  Steve and Jim Steffes asked me to contact
you for the following information.  I've listed specific requests for
several people, but am copying many more of you for your input as well.
Anything you can provide by sometime on Monday will be appreciated!

Dave Parquet - Siting of new power plants in California.  Any insight you
can provide regarding the rules, the current climate, what would fix the
current situation, etc.

Richard Sanders - Steve thinks he might be asked about whether the market
was manipulated.  Please provide information on whether this was the case
and who the participants likely were.  What's the current climate regarding
sanctions, etc.?

Mary Schoen - Any information you can provide relating to air emission
issues in California, and specific details for our recommendations
regarding air emissions.

Steve Walton - The status on RTO West, Desert Star, Cal ISO and general
information on RO development.

Sue Mara - Specific ordering language requiring the utilities to buy only
from the PX.  Was it required through legislation or the CPUC, and what
exactly does it mean.  Who was involved in formulating the language?
Information on block forward markets.

Alan Comnes - A copy of the CDWR response and anything they might have
available regarding long term proposals from the government.

Dan Allegretti - We have the e-mail Jim sent regarding the UI deal.  Please

 This bill was supposed to be introduced today as the Senate Republican 
Energy Message bill. (We don't have a bill number or verification that it was 
actually introduced.)  However, we believe it will be held an introduced on 
February 5-6th. This bill includes PUHCA repeal, PURPA repeal, Reliability 
and Transmission eminent domain authority.

House Chairmen Tauzin and Barton announced their plans to travel to 
California on a "fact finding" trip while they and other leaders meet today 
at the White House along with Secretary Abraham to discuss policy responses 
to the California situation.

The Senate Democrats do not plan to introduce their bill at all now while the 
House members will wait to draft until after today's meetings.

The Feinstein legislation has bipartisan House cosponsors including 
Congresswoman Bono and Congressman Hunter.

We will follow up with a more comprehensive memo as more details become known.

One more item

1 e. Suspend or relax the RACT ("Reasonably Available Control Technology") 
adjustment requirements to promote the creation of cleaner air and ERCs.  
Example:  When we were having difficulty in finding ERCs for Pastoria, we 
realized that there were quite a few operating gas turbine projects in Kern 
County.  We developed an agreement with GE, because the projects all had GE 
turbines and GE serviced them, to approach the owners of the projects and 
offer to retrofit new emissions reduction technology in exchange for an 
attractive business deal.  The appropriate technology is Dry Low NOX ("DLN") 
which reduces NOX emissions from permitted levels of ~25ppm to <9ppm.  To our 
surprise, since these reductions are "RACT", per present Clean Air Rules we 
can get credit only for reductions below 9 ppm.  Maybe that is intellectually 
OK, but the shocker is that there is now in Kern County no requirement to 
reduce emissions to RACT standards.  So, they keep polluting at 25 ppm...   
We have the same concern with the cement plant initiative we are taking, 
mentioned in item 1.d.  We are working with the largest single source of 
pollution in the SF Bay Area to retrofit it with SCRs, which if successful, 
will reduce emissions by >1000 tons per year, enough for at least a 1000 MW 
plant.  However, there is a plant in Germany just starting up with SCRs.  We 
are concerned that air officials here will become aware of that plant and 
"RACT adjust" any emissions reductions we may get.  I will tell you if that 
happens, the plant will not make the retrofit as the economics simply do not 
work and they will continue to pollute......  You can mention in public the 
Kern County example, but please do not breathe a word about the cement plant 
initiative.

		 Subject: Re: Urgent - Steve Kean to testify at Senate hearing, need info

I have little that Steve does not probably know by heart.  But a few comments 
to Steve's point on siting new power plants.  I ASSUME "SENATE ENERGY 
COMMITTEE" IS THE FEDERAL SENATE, NOT THE STATE SENATE.  I HAVE GEARED MY 
SUGGESTIONS TO THINGS THE FEDS CAN OR SHOULD DO.:

THE PREAMBLE: The continuing lack of leadership by the Governor is causing 
serious concern for anyone looking for a stable environment in which to make 
the $billions in investments required for new power plants.  The desparate 
search for blame placing (of exactly the guys that would make the 
investment), the lawsuits, the simplistic, outright misrepresentations of 
what happened and is happening, the threats of condemnation, etc. are doing a 
good job of making the public very uneasy and effectively destroying the 
"market" that resulted in the largest initiation of investment in power 
plants in the state's history.  To the point, the debt lenders are getting 
nervous; the equity providors are getting nervous.  (Duke:  "I would have 
less third world risk developing a plant in Brazil...")  If the final result 
of all of this is a public power agency that basically controls the grid and 
the buying and selling of power, the cynic might observe that we will have 
traded the accusations of greed of the present environment for a reversion to 
the old environment of inefficiency and escalating rate bases.  In my 
opinion, there is no way that the governor's present political initiatives 
will result in the number of power plants that are necessary to cover the 
demand.  He may be covering the near term price/supply issues with his CDWR 
initiative (I note that it is winter time and power demand is down, 
notwithstanding stage 3 alerts - wait until summer peak demands...), but 
destroyed the desire of the long term risk takers to develop new plants in 
this market.  If the politicians think the "state" can do the development, I 
don't think so.  Think about it:  there just is not anyone in the IOUs or 
CDWR or the Munis or any state agency that can make the decisions necessary 
to make the investments required IN A TIMELY MANNER.    The public entities 
do not even have the staffs to do the required work, much less the political 
environment to get anything done, given the continued thirst for "doing 
things right" vs "doing the right thing."  Maybe we will get back to long 
term power purchase agreements for the development of new power plants.  I 
point out that the Standard Offer contracts developed by the "State" and 
entered into 15 - 20 YEARS AGO in a regulated environment by nearly 10,000 MW 
of QFs are STILL OUT OF THE MONEY.  (Per SCE, since the PX began in 4/98, 
only during August and December of last year were they in the money.  We 
checked it out - they are right.  That is astounding.  And we want to go back 
to that??)  Enron would be pleased to participate in long term PPAs, 
especially since we are developing several sites, and can make money doing 
that.  But if we want to be statesmen about this, we need must get a market 
paradigm back.

THE SUGGESTIONS :

1. Federal Environmental issues:  There are 4 agencies in CA that get 
involved in air issues:  US EPA, CEC, CARB, and the local AQMD.  Lot's of 
rhetoric that each is just doing its own job, but the de facto result of that 
many agencies looking at the inevitably overlapping issues is that the 
requirements end up much tougher than they need to be.  Letting the state 
deal with the last 3, and focusing on the US EPA because of where Steve will 
be testifying, seems like the US EPA (probably through a change in law at the 
Federal level) could do the following:

 a. Take a leadership position in rationalizing the rat warren of districts 
and basins and ERC creation and transfer restrictions.  To our utter 
amazement, every little district that we have gone into to develop power 
plants have completely different rules and have required a completely 
different approach re ERCs- SF Bay Area, South Coast, San Joaquin County, 
Kern County, Placer, etc.  ERCs are the single biggest problem we have in 
moving forward on the development of over 2000 MW of new plants we have on 
the books.  I point out the ERC market in the east for SOX.  SOX ERCs 
produced in Ohio can  be used in a new plant in Indiana.  This is not 
technically crisp, but was a rational, political decision as part of the 
Clean Air Act.  We need that same rationalization now in California.  
Granted, CA and its politics was probably the genesis of the arbitrariness of 
AQMD vs county boundaries vs basin boundaries, but if we can get the state to 
the table to change this, the EPA will be involved.  Leadership by all is 
necessary.  When 2.5 ppm new plants are being held up, the 100 ppm plants 
will continue to be used to produce the power.  Do the math and tell me if 
the pollution produced during the period of delay is worth the result.  Do it 
again realizing that many of these 2.5 ppm plants will never be developed, 
given the difficulty. 

 b. Consider impact fees:  the concept of "pay to pollute."  In LA, there are 
car pool requirements to reduce pollution.  If a company cannot or will not 
carpool sufficiently, they can pay a fine that the district applies (I think) 
to general programs, like electric water heaters vs gas, electric lawn mowers 
vs gasoline, mass transit, etc.  Implement a similar program for power 
plants. Work in concert with the local air district and the EPA to develop a 
program that allows the developer to pay the market price for credits (FYI:  
+$20 million for Pastoria) which the district uses to develop credits from 
existing sources that have not yet been cleaned up  (see list 4 lines above, 
and others.)  Necessity:  power plant proceeds while credits are being 
develop.  If it takes 10 years to develop the credits, consider issues and 
value of fact that the 2.5 ppm plant will eventually replace the 100 ppm 
plants.

 c. Stop the crusade for ever lower BACT requirements that are based on vague 
representations, inconclusive data and over zealous developer agreements.  
Example:  Several years ago, Goalline Technologies developed SCONOX for NOX 
reduction in a 25 MW unit in LA.  Good thing to do, but based primarily on 
the results of that small unit and the salesmanship of Goalline's president, 
we got ratcheted down on our 500 MW plant in Pittsburg to 2.5 ppm.  SCAQMD 
calls to SCR vendors indicated "we can do that".  EPA jumped on board.  
Guarantees from EPC contractors with LDs for nonperformance are different 
than "we can do that" from an equipment supplier.  Now, EPA and others are 
wanting 2 ppm, again based on vague data.  Sam even advises requests to 
consider ~1 ppm.   (I point out that there are ZERO frame 7Fa units in 
operation at these levels in California.)  GE has told us "absolutely not" to 
a 2ppm guarantee.  However, I believe that requirements will in fact be 
reduced again by EPA, just because they can.  Again, do the math on delaying 
or stopping the development of, say, a 2.5 ppm plant (because EPA wants 2 
ppm) in favor of the continued operation of a 100 ppm plant.  Hugely more 
resultant pollution.

 d. Be open minded and proactive with developers' novel methods of creating 
new sources of ERCs.  PG&E had a heck of a time creating ERCs for their Otay 
Mesa 500 MW power plant in San Diego, ending up putting new engines in 4 
harbor boats and +100 garbage trucks.  Enron has several similarly dificult 
initiatives underway (Steve cannot tell anyone this, FYI only:  we are 
looking at replacing engines in harbor boats in SF Bay, replacing engines in 
"yard" locomotives in Sacramento and LA, replacing agricultural pumping 
engines in the Central Valley, putting SCR technology in cement plants all 
over CA.)  We could take years to get these programs approved as did PG&E, or 
we can take several months, with EPAs (and others) leadership.

2. Federal Siting Issues:  California is at least attempting through 
legislation to speed up the siting on new power plants.  Unfortunately, the 
Federal agencies do not have the time line requirements to provide their 
review on the speeded up schedules.  For example, a request of the Fish and 
Wildlife Department for a review/permit gets put on the priority pile, first 
come first serve:  shopping centers, housing developments, power plants, 
power lines, etc.  I understand that our Pastoria project had 65 F&W 
applications ahead of it when we applied.  And, there was no limitation on 
how long they could take to get the review done.  I understand that one power 
project has waited 2 years for its review.  The only way we got our permit 
was Sam Wehn begged F&W to figure a way to get it done ahead of the 65 other 
applications.  Fortunately, F&W figured that we could reapply under an EPA 
rule in this specific case, which did have a timeline limitation.  We should 
not have to rely on luck to get plants permitted.  Suggestion:  require the 
federal agencies involved in power plant or transmission line permitting to 
speed up their review/permitting times to be consistent with the state 
initiatives to speed things up.  

3. Market Issues:  I will not go into this in detail, as Steve is more able 
than I to vocalize these issues.  However, from a power plant development 
point of view, if we want the private sector to develop MERCHANT power 
plants, and I believe we do because of the enormity of the investment 
required, we must get back to a market structure.  As I am sure Steve 
remembers, one of the big issues we all dealt with in "deregulation" was 
stranded cost.  We can avoid those issues by getting the private sector to 
make the investments.  Steve knows all the issues:  stability, liquidity, 
credit worthy counterparties, lots of counterparties, etc.

Auction Doesn't Get Much

A contact of mine at the ISO told me that the auction "didn't get much" and 
the bids weren't "at the Governor's price".  NPR today in SF reported that 
the Governor planned to negotiate the price in the bids (reported to average 
6.9 cents) to a lower number.

PX Stay

CA Court issued a one-week stay preventing the PX from selling the IOUs' 
block forward position (to raise cash) when notified by the Attorney General 
that the Governor may want to obtain the value of the contracts.

Attorney General Orders Exisiting ISO Board to Resign

The CA Attorney General notified the existing, FERC-approved, ISO Board 
Members by letter on Wednesday (1/24) that he had filed a complaint in court 
and expected each of them to tender their resignation by Thursday (1/25).  He 
stated that AB5 had superceded the past state law and led to creation of the 
new Board appointed by the Governor.  If any Board member fails to notify the 
AG today, he will assume that he or she does not intend to relinquish their 
position and the AG "will proceed to serve and prosecute the complaint."  The 
Board meets in Executive Session today. The only rumor I heard was for a mass 
resignation. Joe Hartsoe and Ron Carroll report that FERC does not intend to 
get involved at this time.  The WPTF is considering an injunction.

Governor Davis' ISO Board (DISOB)

The "new" Board met and admitted they know nothing about the details of the 
ISO.  The chair is Michael Kahn (he has been replaced on the Oversight Board 
by Cary Doan.  The ISO informed the DISOB that FERC was expecting a filing on 
Jan 31 describing its market re-design.  The DISOB decided to file a notice 
with FERC saying it has a new Board and can't meet the deadline, and 
promising a progress report in 60 days.  Board Member Mike Florio reported 
thatn Bill Julian in the GOvernor's office had a little group pulled together 
to work on completely changing the ISO's market design.  I found out who's in 
the group -- Bill Hogan and other Navigent members.  That's it. The DISOB 
also agreed to an 8-hour meeting on 2/1.

Armed State Takeover?

My ISO contact (an individual who was born and raised in the Middle East) 
said that the Governor's office has informed the ISO that it has "sheriffs 
standing by" to takeover the powerplants if necessary and has already talked 
with the union, which has agreed to keep operatig the plants if the takeover 
happens.  His comment to me:   "This is like Russia."

Rick - In case you didn't receive this, here is the e-mail that Cynthia sent 
yesterday about next week's Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee 
hearing.  It will be held on Wednesday, January 31 at 9:30 a.m. in 216 Hart

		 Subject: Senate Energy Hearing Witness

Steve:  I ran into Senate Energy Committee Chief of Staff Andrew Lundquist 
who advised me that Chairman Murkowski (R-AK) sent a letter directly to Ken 
Lay asking him or his designee (you?)( Jeff Skilling?)  to testify at the 
January 31st Senate Energy Committee hearing on the California situation.  As 
reported earlier, Secretary Abraham and FERC Chairman Hebert will be 
testifying at the beginning of the hearing.  Enron would be asked to join a 
panel of eight which includes invited witnesses of:  SoCalEd, PG&E, SMUD, 
LAWDP, Calpine, Williams and Reliant.  Should Enron accept, EPSA would have 
four witnesses on this panel of eight.

When I spoke to Andrew, he said the Committee was more interested in hearing 
Enron's testimony on markets, long term contracts, risk management, etc.  
than the generation and new power plant construction viewpoints likely to be 
offered by the other EPSA witnesses.  He believes this will complement what 
the Administration witnesses will say.  Believe it or not, recently, Chairman 
Murkowski has made some progress in moving towards supporting Enron's open 
access electricity  transmission position, although his draft legislation is 
silent on this issue.  Our testimony on the importance of open access for 
reliability purposes ("reliability" would be the tie-in to discuss this issue 
in relation to the draft legislation) plus on the need for consistency with 
the other existing open access provisions in the Murkowski draft bill  could 
provide an excellent platform for Enron to inform many Congressional members 
about California, markets and deregulation needs (the Murkowski draft bill 
was sent to you earlier and is to be introduced February 5th or 6th.)  

Steve, earlier you had asked for the opportunity to do a Hill staff briefing 
on California to reach a larger audience with our messages.  I believe this 
would provide an excellent opportunity to achieve this goal.  If you would 
like, either at a breakfast prior to or in the afternoon after, we could also 
do a Press Club briefing and/or arrange to have a room on the Hill (perhaps 
on the House side) to invite staffers for additional briefings (and include 
the other EPSA witnesses.)

In the alternative, if this hearing date does not work in your schedule,  the 
other EPSA witnesses could make some of our points for us.  However, these 
points might be somewhat diluted given these witnesses' other priorities.  As 
always, you (Jeff and Ken) make a fabulous witness.

Please advise.  (This hearing will be covered extensively by the Press.)

Elizabeth,

 Per your request, I have prepared the following summary.

Western RTO Development:

RTO West.
Area to be included -- WA, OR, ID, MT, Western WY, UT, NV-North & South and 
hopefully Canada (BC Hydro and possibly Alberta)
Filed with FERC "Stage 1" documents in October 2000 -- Governance, Bylaws, 
Draft of Operating Agreement, etc.
Stage 2 development begun January 2001 with of complete proposal in July 2001
Earliest practical operation Fall 2002 (optimistic based on quick on approval 
time)
Plan Quality -- Good overall 
Attractive Features -- independent board, single control area and real time 
voluntary energy market, all parties on same tariff, a tradeable transmission 
right with "use or lose" anti-hoarding provisions.
Unattractive Features -- Majority of transmission rights allocated to 
existing users for a ten year period ("use or lose" will mitigate for short 
term rights but long term rights on existing system will be tough to get).
Desert STAR.
Area to be included -- AZ, NM, CO, Eastern WY
Governance established and Board has been organized.
Have not yet filed a complete plan 
Earliest practical operation Winter 2002 or beyond, depending on when they 
actually file their proposal
Plan quality --  Potentially promising
Attractive Features -- similar transmission right regime as RTO West
Unknown -- whether they will have a single control area, whether 
Unattractive Features -- Majority of transmission rights allocated to 
existing users, board selection committee was manipulated by publics (however 
in practice the independent board selected seems to have been little affected 
by the search firm nomination process)
CA-ISO.
Area included -- CA IOU's only
Fully operational but with CA/FERC jurisdictional struggle over Board 
appointment and independence.
Modifications to meet Order 2000 have been filed which appear to move 
transmission rights close to the proposals under discussion in RTO West and 
Desert STAR


Cooperative Regional Organization Activity:

Seams.
A joint task force of parties involved in RTO West, Desert STAR and CA-ISO 
began meeting in November 2000
Three major seams issues identified and work begun
Scheduling time lines -- aligning processes between three RTOs so that 
business across seams boundaries is not hampered for administrative reasons.
Nature of transmission rights and effect on loop flow -- making the 
congestion management systems work between the three RTOs.
Export fees -- goal is to eliminate pancaking of fixed cost charges between 
RTOs, perhaps by annual transfer payments between RTOs or some other 
reciprocity agreement.
RTG Consolidation.  
WRTA. SWRTA and WSCC voted to merge in to a single organization, the WIO 
(Western Interconnection Organization)
WIO will have three committee:   Planning, Operations, Market Interface.  
The Northwest organization (NRTA) has decided to stay independent for now, 
but if RTO West forms it may just disappear as a separate organization. 

If you need more detail, please let me know.

Steve

I have always found it useful in preparing for congressional hearings to have 
"Hearing Themes."  The themes represent  both the points we want to make in 
our written testimony and the points we should try to emphasize in our oral 
answers to Member questions.   Please feel free to edit.  Here is a first 
cut: 

I. The energy problems in California are of its own making and ultimately 
will require action by the State   government.   The State did not deregulate 
in 1996, it misregulated.  
 
II. In the short-term, California must provide support to the Utilities to 
maintain reliability as they are doing with 
 the California Department of Water Resources purchases and the Utilities' 
financial problems resulting from their
 inability to recover power costs should be addressed immediately by the 
State.  

III. For the long-term, California should:
 
 --Increase supply and reduce demand
 --Bring retail rates in line with the cost of a reasonable portfolio of 
electricity supply
 --Allow customers to benefit stable long-term contracts
 --Not abandon its commitment to foster retail competition.
 (Here we should explain what we mean by each point and suggest solutions.  
Our explanation should not
 assume deep knowledge of the problem or the solutions.)

IV. The California "experience" does not mean deregulation leads to higher 
prices for consumers and a lack
 of reliable supply.  

 --The California crisis illustrates that true deregulation is the answer, 
misregulation is not.
 --There are ample illustrations of "good" state deregulation efforts.
 --Current Federal efforts to increase supply and decrease demand should be 
pursued.
 --Federal efforts to increase incentives for power generation should include 
regulatory policies
 designed to extend open access to all uses of the bulk power transmission 
grid so that power
 can move freely to meet demand and new generation facilities may be brought 
on-line.


V. Enron has been a positive presence in California.

 --Enron is neither a net generator nor a net user of energy in California.
 --We are in the business of making markets and making them work better.
 --From the outset, Enron has been working with all parties to find 
constructive, workable,
 and well-tested solutions to California's problems.  
 --While we strongly disagree with the DOE supply orders, we have fully 
cooperated with
 them in California


VI. Time is running out.  California must act soon, just as our Federal 
efforts to put in
 place a national energy policy should be soon.

Here are possible Q's.  Dan W. will prepare first cut at answers.  

Questions for January 31 Hearing

Price Gouging
?   On January 22, your company reported fourth-quarter results for
2000, in which you showed that profits from your energy trading unit rose
256 percent and your overall earnings rose 34 percent.  How much of this was
attributable to increased sales in California?  How much did you make from
sales in California?
?   What is the highest per kilowatt-hour price Enron charged on the
spot market?  What is the cost of production for that power?
?   In a recent Houston Chronicle article (January 23, 2001), Mr.
Skilling, your CEO was quoted as saying that not only had the California
situation not had an impact on earnings, but that "it may even turn out to
be a benefit in the long run."  Can you please explain the long-term
benefits you expect?
?   In a recent New York Times column by Paul Krugman, Ken Lay was
quoted as saying that California consumers "need to see the price signals
that is, pay much more and start modifying behavior to reduce demand until
we get more supplies."  What did Mr. Lay mean by this?  With the tremendous
profits that Enron is making in this situation, isn't it pretty brazen for
him to be suggesting that California consumers should pay more for their
power?

Market Manipulation
?   A number of generators and wholesalers, including Enron, have been
accused of withholding energy to drive up energy prices in the Western
states.  I understand that you are being sued in state court in San
Francisco for such activities and an independent monitor has supported these
allegations.  Does Enron currently have any generation assets off-line for
maintenance?  Did Enron make all of its generated power in the Western
states available for purchase by California utilities?  If not, why did it
withhold power?  How much did you withhold or sell in other states despite
knowing of the crisis in California?
?   At the time that the spot market collapsed and two of California's
largest utilities were teetering on the verge of bankruptcy, what price was
Enron asking for its power on the spot market?  What was Enron's cost of
producing that power?  How much profit did you make in December from sales
in California?
?   Did Enron ever refuse to sell power to a California utility because
of concerns about their credit worthiness?  Did your company ever tell
California utilities that it would not sell power to them because of credit
concerns?
?   Do you believe that Enron has any responsibility as a corporation in
a crisis such as occurred in California?  How do you justify making such
large profits, driving the utilities into bankruptcy and then refusing to
sell power to those same utilities because of their credit worthiness?  

Utility Forbearance & Auction
?   California clearly has a significant problem with the potential
bankruptcy of two of its largest utilities.  How much money do those
utilities owe your company?  Has your company offered any payment
forbearance or forgiveness in light of the excessive prices that you were
charging them on the spot market for power?
?   California held an Internet auction last week for long-term
contracts for sale of power to the state.  Did Enron participate in the
auction?  What price did you offer for power in non-peak times?  What price
did you bid for power during peaking periods?
?   Your company has successfully gouged the utilities in California for
power on the spot market because long-term contracts were discouraged.  Now,
you are looking to enter into long-term contracts, which many experts
believe will be at rates far above the market in the future.  You really are
going to profit coming and going.  How can you claim that you are not price
gouging in this case?
?   In the past, you have offered power to California utilities in
long-term contracts at rates less than $.06 per kilowatt-hour.  How do you
justify previously offering power at much lower rates and now saying that
you are unable to provide it for less than a much higher price?

Role in California Deregulation
?   Your company was supportive of the California deregulation efforts
and has been a leading supporter of deregulation nationwide.  In light of
the "colossal failure" of the effort in California, do you still support
deregulation in other states or at the federal level?  What safeguards would
you support to protect against increased rates for consumers?

The Future
?   California is likely to enact a legislative fix to address this
problem.  What do you think will happen this summer during peak demand
periods?  Is there another crisis in the making in California or in other
states such as New York?

Political Contributions & Activities
?   Your company has been very active politically and according to press
reports, Mr. Lay is very close to President Bush.  Wasn't your company one
of the biggest donors to the Bush Campaign and the Inaugural Committee?  How
much money did your company contribute in soft money to the Bush Campaign
and the RNC?  How much money did your executives give in personal money to
the Bush Campaign and the RNC?  How much to the inaugural?
?   Has anyone from Enron participated in the Bush transition teams or
the so-called "advisory committees?"  
?   What information and suggestions has your company or its officials
provided to the transition team or the new Administration regarding energy
deregulation or the California situation?
?   What discussions have officials from your company had with
Administration or Transition officials about the California situation?

 
Softball Questions

?   In the short term and then in the long term, what can California do
to fix its power supply system?
?   What do you believe are the flaws in the current California system?
The Power Exchange?  The Independent System Operator?
?   Why did deregulation fail in California?
?   Some people, including Governor Davis, have suggested that
out-of-state power suppliers, such as Enron, are to blame for this crisis,
is that true?
?   Some people in California have suggested that the State should take
over the power system.  Please comment on this proposal.  Is this a good
idea?
?   In which states has deregulation worked?  How do you explain the
success in those states in contrast with the failures in California?
?   This Committee will likely consider deregulation legislation at some
point in the future.  Should we undertake this effort?

I have little that Steve does not probably know by heart.  But a few comments 
to Steve's point on siting new power plants.  I ASSUME "SENATE ENERGY 
COMMITTEE" IS THE FEDERAL SENATE, NOT THE STATE SENATE.  I HAVE GEARED MY 
SUGGESTIONS TO THINGS THE FEDS CAN OR SHOULD DO.:

THE PREAMBLE: The continuing lack of leadership by the Governor is causing 
serious concern for anyone looking for a stable environment in which to make 
the $billions in investments required for new power plants.  The desparate 
search for blame placing (of exactly the guys that would make the 
investment), the lawsuits, the simplistic, outright misrepresentations of 
what happened and is happening, the threats of condemnation, etc. are doing a 
good job of making the public very uneasy and effectively destroying the 
"market" that resulted in the largest initiation of investment in power 
plants in the state's history.  To the point, the debt lenders are getting 
nervous; the equity providors are getting nervous.  (Duke:  "I would have 
less third world risk developing a plant in Brazil...")  If the final result 
of all of this is a public power agency that basically controls the grid and 
the buying and selling of power, the cynic might observe that we will have 
traded the accusations of greed of the present environment for a reversion to 
the old environment of inefficiency and escalating rate bases.  In my 
opinion, there is no way that the governor's present political initiatives 
will result in the number of power plants that are necessary to cover the 
demand.  He may be covering the near term price/supply issues with his CDWR 
initiative (I note that it is winter time and power demand is down, 
notwithstanding stage 3 alerts - wait until summer peak demands...), but 
destroyed the desire of the long term risk takers to develop new plants in 
this market.  If the politicians think the "state" can do the development, I 
don't think so.  Think about it:  there just is not anyone in the IOUs or 
CDWR or the Munis or any state agency that can make the decisions necessary 
to make the investments required IN A TIMELY MANNER.    The public entities 
do not even have the staffs to do the required work, much less the political 
environment to get anything done, given the continued thirst for "doing 
things right" vs "doing the right thing."  Maybe we will get back to long 
term power purchase agreements for the development of new power plants.  I 
point out that the Standard Offer contracts developed by the "State" and 
entered into 15 - 20 YEARS AGO in a regulated environment by nearly 10,000 MW 
of QFs are STILL OUT OF THE MONEY.  (Per SCE, since the PX began in 4/98, 
only during August and December of last year were they in the money.  We 
checked it out - they are right.  That is astounding.  And we want to go back 
to that??)  Enron would be pleased to participate in long term PPAs, 
especially since we are developing several sites, and can make money doing 
that.  But if we want to be statesmen about this, we need must get a market 
paradigm back.

THE SUGGESTIONS :

1. Federal Environmental issues:  There are 4 agencies in CA that get 
involved in air issues:  US EPA, CEC, CARB, and the local AQMD.  Lot's of 
rhetoric that each is just doing its own job, but the de facto result of that 
many agencies looking at the inevitably overlapping issues is that the 
requirements end up much tougher than they need to be.  Letting the state 
deal with the last 3, and focusing on the US EPA because of where Steve will 
be testifying, seems like the US EPA (probably through a change in law at the 
Federal level) could do the following:

 a. Take a leadership position in rationalizing the rat warren of districts 
and basins and ERC creation and transfer restrictions.  To our utter 
amazement, every little district that we have gone into to develop power 
plants have completely different rules and have required a completely 
different approach re ERCs- SF Bay Area, South Coast, San Joaquin County, 
Kern County, Placer, etc.  ERCs are the single biggest problem we have in 
moving forward on the development of over 2000 MW of new plants we have on 
the books.  I point out the ERC market in the east for SOX.  SOX ERCs 
produced in Ohio can  be used in a new plant in Indiana.  This is not 
technically crisp, but was a rational, political decision as part of the 
Clean Air Act.  We need that same rationalization now in California.  
Granted, CA and its politics was probably the genesis of the arbitrariness of 
AQMD vs county boundaries vs basin boundaries, but if we can get the state to 
the table to change this, the EPA will be involved.  Leadership by all is 
necessary.  When 2.5 ppm new plants are being held up, the 100 ppm plants 
will continue to be used to produce the power.  Do the math and tell me if 
the pollution produced during the period of delay is worth the result.  Do it 
again realizing that many of these 2.5 ppm plants will never be developed, 
given the difficulty. 

 b. Consider impact fees:  the concept of "pay to pollute."  In LA, there are 
car pool requirements to reduce pollution.  If a company cannot or will not 
carpool sufficiently, they can pay a fine that the district applies (I think) 
to general programs, like electric water heaters vs gas, electric lawn mowers 
vs gasoline, mass transit, etc.  Implement a similar program for power 
plants. Work in concert with the local air district and the EPA to develop a 
program that allows the developer to pay the market price for credits (FYI:  
+$20 million for Pastoria) which the district uses to develop credits from 
existing sources that have not yet been cleaned up  (see list 4 lines above, 
and others.)  Necessity:  power plant proceeds while credits are being 
develop.  If it takes 10 years to develop the credits, consider issues and 
value of fact that the 2.5 ppm plant will eventually replace the 100 ppm 
plants.

 c. Stop the crusade for ever lower BACT requirements that are based on vague 
representations, inconclusive data and over zealous developer agreements.  
Example:  Several years ago, Goalline Technologies developed SCONOX for NOX 
reduction in a 25 MW unit in LA.  Good thing to do, but based primarily on 
the results of that small unit and the salesmanship of Goalline's president, 
we got ratcheted down on our 500 MW plant in Pittsburg to 2.5 ppm.  SCAQMD 
calls to SCR vendors indicated "we can do that".  EPA jumped on board.  
Guarantees from EPC contractors with LDs for nonperformance are different 
than "we can do that" from an equipment supplier.  Now, EPA and others are 
wanting 2 ppm, again based on vague data.  Sam even advises requests to 
consider ~1 ppm.   (I point out that there are ZERO frame 7Fa units in 
operation at these levels in California.)  GE has told us "absolutely not" to 
a 2ppm guarantee.  However, I believe that requirements will in fact be 
reduced again by EPA, just because they can.  Again, do the math on delaying 
or stopping the development of, say, a 2.5 ppm plant (because EPA wants 2 
ppm) in favor of the continued operation of a 100 ppm plant.  Hugely more 
resultant pollution.

 d. Be open minded and proactive with developers' novel methods of creating 
new sources of ERCs.  PG&E had a heck of a time creating ERCs for their Otay 
Mesa 500 MW power plant in San Diego, ending up putting new engines in 4 
harbor boats and +100 garbage trucks.  Enron has several similarly dificult 
initiatives underway (Steve cannot tell anyone this, FYI only:  we are 
looking at replacing engines in harbor boats in SF Bay, replacing engines in 
"yard" locomotives in Sacramento and LA, replacing agricultural pumping 
engines in the Central Valley, putting SCR technology in cement plants all 
over CA.)  We could take years to get these programs approved as did PG&E, or 
we can take several months, with EPAs (and others) leadership.

2. Federal Siting Issues:  California is at least attempting through 
legislation to speed up the siting on new power plants.  Unfortunately, the 
Federal agencies do not have the time line requirements to provide their 
review on the speeded up schedules.  For example, a request of the Fish and 
Wildlife Department for a review/permit gets put on the priority pile, first 
come first serve:  shopping centers, housing developments, power plants, 
power lines, etc.  I understand that our Pastoria project had 65 F&W 
applications ahead of it when we applied.  And, there was no limitation on 
how long they could take to get the review done.  I understand that one power 
project has waited 2 years for its review.  The only way we got our permit 
was Sam Wehn begged F&W to figure a way to get it done ahead of the 65 other 
applications.  Fortunately, F&W figured that we could reapply under an EPA 
rule in this specific case, which did have a timeline limitation.  We should 
not have to rely on luck to get plants permitted.  Suggestion:  require the 
federal agencies involved in power plant or transmission line permitting to 
speed up their review/permitting times to be consistent with the state 
initiatives to speed things up.  

3. Market Issues:  I will not go into this in detail, as Steve is more able 
than I to vocalize these issues.  However, from a power plant development 
point of view, if we want the private sector to develop MERCHANT power 
plants, and I believe we do because of the enormity of the investment 
required, we must get back to a market structure.  As I am sure Steve 
remembers, one of the big issues we all dealt with in "deregulation" was 
stranded cost.  We can avoid those issues by getting the private sector to 
make the investments.  Steve knows all the issues:  stability, liquidity, 
credit worthy counterparties, lots of counterparties, etc.
