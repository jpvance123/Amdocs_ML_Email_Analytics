In order to continually develop and make improvements to the functionality of EnronOnline we are rolling out several changes tonight, which will be in effect on Monday August 20, 2001. Some of these changes will affect Stack Manager while others affect the Website. A summary of these changes is listed below.

Stack Manager Changes

Top of Stack limit orders - This feature will allow the price submitted via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader's stack price. Stack Manger will list the price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the  floated stack window.  Orders will be queued by price and time stamp. When a counterparty trades on a " Top of Stack Entry" it will create back to back transactions; one between Enron and the counterparty submitting the order, and the other between Enron and the counterparty clicking on the website.

In order to turn on this functionality select the " Allowed Top of Stack" option, in the Orders section of the product properties page.  If regular limit order functionality is desired the "Allowed"  option should be selected.

Please note that this feature will be released in a disabled mode and will be turned on sometime next week after determining which business units want to roll this out.

Restricted Top of Stack limit orders - This feature will allow the price submitted only by internal traders via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader's stack price. Stack Manger will list price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the  floated stack window.  Orders will be queued by price and time stamp. When a counterparty trades on a " Top of Stack Entry" it will create back to back transactions one between Enron and the counterparty submitting the order, and the other between Enron and the counterparty clicking on the website.

In order to turn on this functionality select the " allowed as Restricted Top of Stack" option, in the Orders section of the product properties page.  If regular limit order functionality is desired the "Allowed"  option should be selected. If a product has active orders against it you will not be able to select the "Restricted Top of Stack" feature.

Advanced Filtering Ability on All Products Tab -  Drop down filtering capability is now available for each field in the All Products tab in stack manager. In order to filter click on the arrow next to the field title. A drop down box with a list of attributes will appear. Highlight the attribute by which you wish to filter. To turn off the filter click on the arrow and select the " All" option from the drop down box.


Website Changes

New Submission Screen for Restricted Top of Stack Limit Orders -  The submission screen for  products that allow  Top of Stack or Restricted Top of Stack limit orders is as follows.
 

The submit button on the left makes a submission for a normal transaction, while the button on the right will submit as a limit order.  In case of the Restricted Top of Stack limit orders only internal traders will see the new submission box. 

Price of Limit Orders 

Modify Limit Orders
 Customers now have the ability to modify the price of any active order. In order to do so highlight the order to be modified and use the plus or minus sign next to the price field on  at the top of the "Today's Orders" section. The price will move up or down in the same increments as the tick size for that product. Once the price is at the desired level click the "Set" button and the price will be modified. Another way to modify the price on a limit order is to click on the price field on a particular limit order.  You will see a box with plus, minus and set buttons that allow you to modify that order.

Expiration time for Limit Orders
Customers can now place limit orders with expiration times of up to 30 days. Currently they may place orders for only up to 12 hours.

Float the Today's Orders Section
You can now float the " Limit Order " section. In order to do so, right click in the "Today's Orders " section and select the float window option. In order to make the window " Stay On Top " right click on the floated window and select the stay on top option.

Mid Market Client - Mid market originators will now have the ability to transact on behalf of their customers, while including their desired margin on the trade, on EnronOnline products. In order to do so Click on the bid or offer price, a customised submission window will appear.  Select the counterparty for whom you wish to transact from a drop down list , enter the desired customer price and margin and click submit. For example if a customer wants to buy Nymex Sep 01 at 3.36 and you wish to have a 1 cent margin, please enter 3.36 as the desired price and 0.01 as the margin. The system will trade the order when the EnronOnline offer for Nymex Sep 01 is at 3.35, book the trade at 3.36 and record the 0.01 origination amount.

In order to be set up to use this functionality. Please call the EnronOnline Product Control Group.

Changes to Website Passwords - As an added security measure, which has been requested by many customers, some new password rules have been instituted. First, the password cannot be equal to the login ID. Second, each user will be prompted to change his password every 90 days. These rules apply to all website passwords for both internal and external users.


Please note  Stack Manager changes will be available all traders as of Monday August 20, 2001. The changes to the website will be rolled out to a few internal users on Monday with the rest of the internal users being upgraded Monday night, and external users by the end of the week.  Over the next couple of weeks all users will be prompted to change their website passwords.

If you have any questions regarding these changes please contact me at 713-853-1787.

Subject:	NEW Load Curtailment Product for New York



Introducing a product that lets New York customers turn their 
energy load flexibility into a revenue opportunity.

Enron can turn energy usage flexibility into revenue for our customers. When a customer chooses Enron's product, 
they receive monthly payments in exchange for reducing their energy usage at Enron's request. Requests are made 
when energy market prices are high, so the energy the customer doesn't use can be sold on the market at a premium. 
Bad time for the customer? No problem--they can choose not to reduce usage, and pay a 
"buy through price" to Enron instead. Want to learn more? Click here .

The Boston Differential for August 2001 is ($.1166).  I want to understand the contract better before I give you the Sep price.

Ruth, you and I are chatting about this today I hope.

Kam, I'm guessing this becomes an O&A issue each month.  I don't know if you need to be involved or not.

Hi Chris,

I realize that you are getting bugged from a few of us in Canada for the Boston Differential numbers.  I am in Accounting and I am in desperate need of the Boston Differential for August and September so that I can finish my invoicing for the month.  I really have to have these numbers by the end of the day today (latest).  Sorry for being a pest, but I am starting to panic!  Please send these numbers to me or Nicole Laporte, as soon as possible.

Thanks,
Kelly

Chris,
We just require August and September, we already have July.
Would it possible to get the differential number before Wednesday? Our Accounting group requires this number for invoicing and they are a few weeks late with their August invoice and require the differential immediately.
Please let me know,
Thanks,
Nicole

Sorry about the delay.  I'm starting to look at this again.  I know you need August and September.  Did you say you also need July?  

I don't know if Canada makes any money off this deal but my book is taking a beating.  Ruth Concannon and I are meeting Wednesday to discuss this deal.  There are some other things going on with this deal that she is aware of.  I should have your prices by them.

Thanks

Nicole, I have the Boston Gas confirmation letter.  Thanks.

Kimat, are you familiar with the Boston Gas worksheet Dick Jenkins would update to calculate the Tenn Z6 city gate price?  It wasn't very big, and Dick would have me verify the Iroquois and Tenn transport variable cost.

The reason you don't see the origination for Jon McKay for the Sithe deal for $1,229,328 in the YTD and June Revenue by Originator metrics is because I wanted to capture all origination for just the originations group.  I included origination for Rob, Paul Devries and Kyle Kitigawa per Rob's request.  I checked the gas book for June and Jon's origination was recorded by the risk group.  If you have any further questions with regards to this matter, I will be back in the office on August 27, 2001.

Regards,

Grant

Chris,

I have several questions on these new product types.  Could you help me out so that I can send this for testing?

Is this the index for all products?   The Index shall be the settlement price for the last scheduled Trading Day of the NYMEX Henry Hub Natural Gas Futures Contract.
Which ones will be the locations you will be using?
Please match a Risk Book assignment to each location
Who will be the trader?
Who will be the risk book administrator?
What will be the terms trading? (start and end dates)


Please let me know when you get all this information.

Thanks,
Melba Lozano

Vladi,

I don't know if you are going to get this in time, but I wanted to try to get some of you input on a deal you price earlier for Yankee Gas.  Structuring needs you Gas Daily Daily offer for 30 peak day at TETCO M3.  You previously indicated US$0.13 for 40,000 a day and it looks like they are going to do the whole volume.  They will notify you by 9:00 am the day before delivery.

I don't know what the right price is but it would seem that we could anticipate their need to call and get in front of  the market moves.  I am going to stick with the 0.13/mmbtu unless I hear from you.

I hope the vacation is going well.  Sorry to disturb you.

Regards,

Jon

Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. 

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An "Alliance MX turret quick reference guide" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as "Caller ID" and "Voicemail Indication".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:
 
Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	
Weather Channel	12401	801	
CNN Headlines News	12402	802	
CNN Financial News	12403	803	
CNBC	12404	804	
MSNBC	12405	805	
Bloomberg	12406	806	
Financial News Network	12407	807	
CNN	12408	808	
Fox Sports	12409	809	
ESPN1	12410	810	


Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network "in-building" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible "Plug n Play" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.

Keeping an Open forum
We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com

John,

I have added the curves to a curve fetch file in O:\ERMS\Excel Queries\JMcKayCurveFetch.xls
I did not know which curves to get rid of, but if you go through it just hide the ones that you don't want, you won't have to go back and add them later.  I have access to the folder and file, but I don't have rights to run the macro.  I have tacked the curves you requested to the last four columns of each sheet (one sheet for dailies and the other sheet for basis curves).  Call with any questions.

Adam

Adam,

The file you sent me is exactly the type of spread sheet I needed.  Thank You.   However, I was wondering if you could get access (via that file) to a few other points.  Specifically, I am in need of Gas Daily Curves for NGI-Chicago, GDM-Dawn,GDM-Niagara, and GD-Hehub.  And with respect to basis curves, I am in need of a curve for Niagara and Columbia Gulf.

If you could point me in the right direction I would really appreciate it.

Thanks,

Jon

Jon, Thank you very much for your assistance in terminating our Jan-Mar 2002
contracts.  I will follow up next week with a deal description to match up

Again, thanks and best wishes.  Cynthia

Here is the curve fetch file sent to me.  It has plenty of points in it.  If you give me a list of which ones you need we may be able to construct a secondary worksheet to vlookup the values.

Let me know if it works.   It may be required to have a certain version of Oracle for it to work properly.

 was currently nominating gas to Entex city gates? What about storage?   I =
told him currently we were not nominating all the gas however; the city gat=
es were kept whole with the no notice storage K#2210.  He was told by Tenne=
ssee the storage was not being nominated & there was a good possibility tha=
t the city gates were not receiving their gas.  I reassured him the city ga=
tes were receiving their gas.  ENA does not nominate storage, it  was autom=
atically done at the pipeline level due to the 2 day allocation lag.    As =
per his previous conversation with Vicki Versen, he has an estimate what th=
e storage levels were &  wanted to make sure there was enough gas in the st=
orage to cover December.  I told him he would need to speak with Vicki on t=
hat matter.  I asked him if there was a problem  that needed to be resolved=
 & his response: Reliant is going to wait it through to see the outcome wit=
h Enron, but wanted to make sure the gas was being delivered. =20

After the conversation, I run the storage report for December & the gas is =
automatically being withdrawn.  I called Royal back  and confirmed gas was =
being withdrawn from storage. He asked for a copy of the storage report.  I=
 did not discuss volume or what Enron's intention were at this time. I have=
 not  fax him a copy of the storage report as per his request.  =20

I did not want to alienate Royal, but at same time I did not want to provid=
