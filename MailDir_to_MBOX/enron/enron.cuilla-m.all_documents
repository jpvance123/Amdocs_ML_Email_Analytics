Also, this year if you forget to turn in bye week replacements (for K or Def) 
or replacements for players that are on a bye, you will have up til friday to 
make those pickups.  WE ALL HAVE TO WORK SO I DON'T WANT TO GET PEOPLE 
BOTHERING ME IF YOU JUST HEARD SOME PLAYER BECAME AVAILABLE.  To take 
advantage of this you have to need a bye week replacement or not be able to 
field a team because you have too many players on a bye (you don't have QB or 
only 2 WRs.  If you have three WRs who can start but want another one because 
you don't like one of the ones that are able to start YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO 
PICK UP ANY PLAYERS AFTER THE THURSDAY 1PM DEADLINE.

Just a quick note about the free agent and bye week replacements for this 
year.  The free agent draft will be held Thursday at 1pm.  You will have 
until 1pm to submit your free agent requests to me at mcuilla@enron.com.  You 
should include who you want, who you want to drop and the amount of points 
you want to bid.  You can bid 0 points for a free agent however if someone 
bids 1 point you will lose.  In the case of a tying bid the two teams will 
have an open bid to determine who gets the player.  Everyone will start with 
100 points and you more points based on your weekly finish (1 point for 
highest score and 12 points for lowest score).

I made a few other changes after I had time to think about our discussion 
yesterday.  Let's get
another conference call to discuss why these points are important to Enron.

I have not had time to get with the traders yet. So please do not start 
e-mailing anything to them
yet.

Thanks,

 A roving band of young men took to the streets of Montrose, committing more

killed. A lot of people were terrified. Most times, the robbers' "loot" was a

Hi Martin :
I have all the quotes for you with shipping and delivery ready. However I
will need to call you because of factory restrictions quoting over the
internet. I will send a brochure if this will help.
Thanks,
Madison

Just a quick note about the free agent and bye week replacements for this 
year.  The free agent draft will be held Thursday at 1pm.  You will have 
until 1pm to submit your free agent requests to me at mcuilla@enron.com.  You 
should include who you want, who you want to drop and the amount of points 
you want to bid.  You can bid 0 points for a free agent however if someone 
bids 1 point you will lose.  In the case of a tying bid the two teams will 
have an open bid to determine who gets the player.  Everyone will start with 
100 points and you more points based on your weekly finish (1 point for 
highest score and 12 points for lowest score).

Thank you for all your interest in Trent Green, however he has always been on 
Mike Morris' team.  Maybe next time before you bid on someone you should make 
sure they are a free agent (Goss and Greg Martin)!

 FYI - I just recently paid for a portion of our At&T bill with the
rest of the free money in our Waterhouse account (wrote a check in the
amount of like $2200).  The remaining balance is something like $2,500.  All
of that amount is allocated to our monthly savings for property/school
taxes.  I guess what you're saying is you would like to borrow from this
savings account to make this investment.  As long as you feel confident that
we will be able to reimburse that amount somehow to pay our taxes (should we
not get a return on the investment), then I guess we should go for it if
it's something you're excited about and believe is a good investment.
Naturally, I would prefer we only invest $500 because of the risk involved
and Christmas just around the corner, but you're the one with the financial
instincts and know-how.  Wifey

Hey how much of the money in our Waterhouse account is budgeted for
expenses.  I am thinking that it would be a good investment (speculative in
nature though) to purchase some options on Enron.  The options would expire
in January and the potential return could vary between a loss of 100% of
the investment to a 400%-500% return.  I think between a $500-$1,000
investment would be wise given the nature of it.

Hey everybody!!!

I know the holiday season gets a little crazy, but if you're not attending a
company Christmas party, fighting the masses at the malls, or going to
Cousin Timmy's dysfunctional family get-together, please leave Saturday
night open for hall deckin' H-town style!!

The plans for the entire evening have not been determined, but Zooey & Marty
have graciously offered The Bellefontaine Pub as a starting place for all of
us.  Just think... We can sing & roast marshmallows there for a couple of
hours, and then we'll hit the town with our holiday Nog breath!!   Just
another great excuse to get together & celebrate with friends!   So....

Bring your favorite beverage, and come by for the munchies & fun around
7:00.

Look forward to seeing you all!!

Laura Lou Who

Amy and Alec are definitely welcome!  Actually we had already planned on Amy 
and Alec coming and a couple who we are friends with is bringing their 
daughter, our flower girl, who is about 4 years old.  We have a whole room to 
ourselves at the restaurant so Amy and Alec should be fine.  I talked to 
grandma and she said Julie wouldn't be able to make it so I already knew 
about that.  Don't worry about having 4 more people, the only reason we were 
cautious about inviting aunts and uncles was we didn't want to open up the 
flood gates but most of them already live in Houston or aren't going to make 
it to Houston until late Friday.  As far as the bill just let me know what 
you are comfortable with and we will pick up the rest.  The food bill with 
tax and tip will be about $1,350.  We are very appreciative to have both our 
parent's help as we quickly found that weddings are very expensive.  However, 
we are both adults with good careers and try to be very self-sufficient.  
Also, we realize that some things we do seem extravagant by our parents 
standards.  We could have just as easily had a rehearsal at a Mexican 
restaurant and it would have been cheaper - however we would rather have 
things a certain way and pay for the difference.  Also, I know that you guys 
are on a tight budget with the building of your house.  The bottom line is 
that we are grateful for any help we receive and have the resources to pay 
the balance.  Our most  important concern is that all our family and friends 
to have a great time.  While I am on the subject, I hope your mother and 
grandma Ina aren't going to get their feeling hurt about people drinking wine 
at the dinner.  If you think they will please mention it to them on the way 
down because I don't want them to be offended but I can't change who Zooey 
and I are.  Just so you know we will have dinner and desert and then there 
will be several toasts starting with the best man (James Cook) and the matron 
of honor (Amber) and then probably ending in Zooey and me doing a quick 
toast.  We would love for all our family to be there but if grandmother or 
Betty Joyce is going to get offended and don't want to stay I understand.  
Also, do you know if Skipper is planning to attend.  We haven't received a 
reply card as to whether he will be there or not.  As to this weekend, I am 
going to try to stop by but don't have a car so just depends what is going 
on.  I will be in Dallas so if Mark is coming over Saturday afternoon I could 
get a ride from him.  I'll try to talk to him and see if that works.  
Finally, we are both really looking forward to our big day and are very glad 
to have all our family there to support us!  If you have any questions please 
call me tonight at the house.

     Hi Marty,

     Amy and I were talking over the weekend and she said she did not plan
     to attend the rehearsal dinner because there was no one to keep Alec.
     Would you and Zooey think it was OK if she came and brought Alec for
     dinner only and left as soon as they were through eating?  She said
     she did not want to ask you about it because she didn't want you or
     Zooey to feel any pressure.  This is your special time and she doesn't
     want to detract from it in any way.  I feel sorry for her missing out.
     It is hard for Alec to be still and quite for very long but I think he
     would be fine while we are eating.  Would you please talk with Zooey
     and ask her how she feels about Amy bringing Alec for a while.  Amy
     would leave right away if Alec was disturbing anyone.  If you prefer
     he doesn't come, just say so.  There will certainly be no hard
     feelings over it.

     I spoke with Betty Joyce Sunday and Julianna and her husband are not
     going to be able to come.  Joyce, Chester, Renee, and Travis (her
     boyfriend) are planning to arrive in Houston Friday afternoon the
     29th.  Dad and I are bringing Grandma Ina and Mamanet with us and
     should arrive early in the afternoon on Friday.  Mike decided to fly
     and is coming in Saturday around 4 p.m.  There will be 9 or 11
     (depending if Amy comes) of us from our family for the rehearsal
     dinner.  I know that is more that you had planned on but I will pay
     for the extra people.  Why don't you call me when you have time and we
     can talk about it.

     Now that Mamanet is coming, she is very excited about the trip.  She
     called me yesterday when she got her ticket and she said she had
     really wanted to come but didn't think she would have the chance to
     come.  I'm glad I was able to work it out.

     Grandma Ina will arrive here this week on Thursday.  It seems like I
     remember you and Zooey were going to be in town this weekend for her
     class reunion.  I know you have a busy schedule and may not have time
     to come by, but if you do let me know when and we will plan lunch or
     whatever.  If you have time you can see the new house.  It is looking
     better every day.

     Love,

     Mom

Martin,
?
I've calculated the total points everyone has earned over the  course of the 
season based on where they finished each week.? For ties, i  took total bench 
points to determine ranking - i think that's the way we do  it.
?
Assuming we all started with 100:
Greg  Martin????????? 158
Mark Friedman???? 152
Gary Lamphier???? 147
Scott Earnest??????  144
Tony  Harris????????? 143
Jeff Gossett????????  142
Bill Kasemervisz? 141
Martin Cuilla???????  139
Mike Morris????????  138
Gary Taylor????????  136
?
Of course, this doesn't take into account the points we've bid  on for 
players we've picked up during the year.
?
Gary

CERA Alert: Dcember 13, 2000 

Title: California on the Brink 
CERA Knowledge Areas: Western Energy, N. American Power, N. American Gas 

CALIFORNIA ON THE BRINK 
The California Stalemate 
California moved closer to the brink of an outage today as concerns over 
credit-worthiness of buyers brought the possibility that generators would 
avoid selling to the California market. While numerous factors have 
contributed to the high cost of power incurred by California's utilities, the 
root cause of the current crisis is a lack of new generation. The current 
credit crisis and its threat to supplies could spark state action to address 
the situation. The collective efforts of all market participants should be 
focused on increasing generation capacity as quickly as possible.

Western power prices have skyrocketed well beyond the record levels set this 
summer. Perhaps because frozen rates insulate the majority of California 
consumers and companies from tangible effects of the market crisis, 
regulators have been able to postpone meaningful market reforms and 
significant rate increases. The California Public Utilities Commission denied 
the requests of Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison to end 
their rate freezes, forcing these utilities at least temporarily to finance 
the costs of higher wholesale energy. This has created an unsustainable 
accumulation of costs and a loss of faith in the California market. 

The current credit crisis and the potential for blackouts may become the 
galvanizing events that provide state regulators with a public mandate to 
address the underlying structural problems in the industry. However, there is 
no guarantee that these regulatory actions will expedite an effective 
solution for customers and the industry as a whole. Wholesale and retail 
markets that emerge from regulatory intervention are likely to remain 
muddled. In the necessarily political process that will follow, it is 
possible that-as has largely been the case so far-the steps taken will fail 
to move the California power market toward a more enduring solution and will 
instead continue to mask the underlying structural flaws. 

In the six months since California's supply shortfall began plaguing Western 
markets, regulators have done little to address the underlying problem. 
Rather than addressing the cause of the supply shortage-establishing a market 
environment that encourages timely additions of new generating capacity and 
demand side responses-efforts are instead directed at trying to lay blame for 
the crisis and lessen the immediate financial impact on customers. Indeed, 
several actions taken thus far have served more to compound the problem by 
discouraging new power plant additions. These include price caps, repeated 
changes to market rules, attempts to seize generator profits, and a 
challenging siting and permitting process.

Medicine Worse than the Illness 
Several years of electricity demand growth and low prices in California were 
accompanied by very few additions to the supply base. Regulators did not pay 
adequate attention to the looming supply shortfall. The void of consensus 
over the cause of the current crisis has instead been replaced by a series of 
bandaid remedies that address the symptoms, but not the cause, of 
California's electric market woes.* 

* Challenging siting and permitting. Despite state action to better 
coordinate the siting and permitting process for new power plants, power 
plant developers still face high hurdles. Local community opposition alone 
has struck down some key proposed facilities.

* Price caps discourage investment. State and federal proposals to cap prices 
limit the attractiveness of the California wholesale power market, especially 
for developers who have the option of channeling scarce capital and equipment 
to more stable or more attractive markets outside the state. 

* Repeated rule changes. Frequent rule changes in the ISO markets (including 
the price caps) confound attempts by developers to estimate profits from new 
plant development.

* Calls for refunds. Despite reports by the Power Exchange, the ISO, and the 
FERC that no pattern of abuse could be found from their examination of the 
California markets, state officials continue to accuse power providers of 
gaming the market. Calls by state officials for refunds of generator profits 
are a threat to new plant development.

* Facility inspections. Recent inspections of power plants by state officials 
to verify that operators are honestly reporting the operational status of 
their generating units accentuates the atmosphere of mistrust.

CERA's recent analysis suggests that merchant plant developers in the West 
are not guaranteed? to make a profit. Prospects of new plant profitability 
are affected by the timing and quantity of new plants, decommissioning of 
older units, demand growth, and numerous other difficult-to-forecast factors. 
California's regulatory actions only further cloud the assessment of 
financial viability and degrade the political environment for developers 
considering entering the state. 

Despite efforts by the California ISO to stimulate new capacity additions in 
the state with a special, limited-term capacity payment, CERA estimates that 
demand growth will continue to outstrip supply additions in the West in 2001. 
In addition, the existing siting and permitting process will prevent a 
sufficient quantity of capacity from entering the market until 2003 at the 
earliest. Therefore, three years remain before a sufficient quantity of 
capacity enters service to significantly dampen prices and decrease the risk 
of an outage. 

The Road to Recovery 
There are a number of actions that can be taken to help relieve the capacity 
shortfall: 

* Encourage new build. Supply must be part of the answer. This requires a 
series of steps that can help facilitate new supply build. While in principal 
some have been taken, such as new fast track approval, the success of these 
actions can only be measured by the build itself. For now, there is still not 
enough new supply coming on until 2003 to relieve supply tightness.? 

* Stabilize investment climate. Utilities must have assurance that they will 
ultimately be allowed to recover market costs for power. This provides the 
credit worthiness needed by sellers to produce energy and to stimulate new 
build.

* Move toward more balanced utility supply portfolios. One of the reasons the 
pressure on customers has been so intense in California has been the absence 
(and even discouragement) of diverse supply portfolios among the utilities in 
the state-particularly for residential and small commercial customers. With 
the market at a peak, however, now is in one sense a sub-optimal time to move 
toward term contracting. Yet these contracts provide the foundation for a 
series of actions-including new supply build and demand side investments. If 
they end up above market, they will at least have achieved the desired effect 
of knocking down prices, a fact which by itself should provide sufficient 
justification for recovering the cost of these commitments.

* Encourage market mechanisms that elicit a demand response. Although 
originally a feature of California's market design, most consumers are 
insulated from price spikes through capped or frozen retail rates. Exposing 
customers to at least some of the market price signals would encourage a 
demand response.

* Encourage market mechanisms that dampen the "Boom Bust" characteristic of 
the market. Whether in the form of a capacity payment, a reserve requirement, 
or a minimum term portfolio requirement, the California power market needs to 
move to a structure that encourages investment in new capacity when the 
market is in balance rather than waiting for a shortage and price shock to 
elicit new investment. Such a structure can help dampen (but not eliminate) 
future price volatility.

* Avoid continuously tinkering with the market. While the market does need to 
be restructured as described above, it also needs to be stable and reliable 
to encourage the development of new supply as well as a robust long-term 
contractual market for power in California. Continually tinkering with the 
market structure-such as the three times the price cap has been shifted since 
July-only serves to undermine confidence in the market. California needs to 
do its best to develop a long-term solution and then let the market run its 
course. 

* Allow for greater environmental flexibility. The state should explore a 
more balanced solution to emissions restrictions in the face of a supply 
shortfall that has been exacerbated by generators that cannot operate due to 
emissions restrictions. 

* Free PURPA power plants to generate. Relief should be granted to PURPA 
power plants that are operational, but are restricted by contract from 
operating to generate only power.

I thought you would be interested in the weather forecast for the Wedding.  
The data includes max temp, max temp deviation from normal (ie if max is 88 
and normal max is 86 max temp deviation is +2), min temp, min temp deviation 
from normal and percent of precipitation.  So far things are looking good.  
We are getting a cold front this weekend (hitting Texas on Monday) and looks 
like things should be beautiful for next weekend.  I wouldn't be that worried 
about the rain either - the reason the POP is so high right now is tropical 
moisture in the Gulf of Mexico and that will blow through this weekend.  
After that the tropics settle down and it is much less likely to get 
tropical  moisture.

Credit cards that is! - I just requested another $50 Macy's GC - this is 
still the best reward that they have (we have another 2,500 points already).  
Also, I straightened up the deal with AT&T Long distance and they are going 
to correct the bill to $33.23 and starting with the next bill we are supposed 
to get 120 minutes a month of free long distance so talk up.  Also, two other 
things - I checked BofA and the Negril pulse came through as $142.09 and also 
I was looking at the AT&T credit card and it had a charge for $117.50 from 
Chi's cakes and more.  I guess that is just the charge for the cake but 
wanted to make sure the it wasn't for the cake stands.  

Since we are both big rich types you want to go to dinner tonight?  Let me 
know.

Love

Hubby

Hey pops I guess you know that the NASDAQ is getting crushed - I think you 
should be OK but I think we should look at changing some of your holdings.  I 
looked and some of your funds haven't done so well this year especially Low 
Priced Stock.  Also, I am worried about earnings for many companies with 
energy prices so high and the prospect of very high prices this winter.  I 
don't know but it might be prudent to even move some money into cash or up 
your bond exposure.  I'll try to call you and talk about it later.  If I 
don't talk to you in the next couple of days remind me and maybe we can look 
at some options when you are here for the wedding.

just
in case it takes us another day to address any other concerns that John may 
have.

Thanks,

Hey Zo...

So, you got a new job?? I didn't know.? Congratulations!? I guess you are
just getting adjusted.? Well, I'm about to have to get readjusted when I go
back to work in a week or so.? I'm ready though.

Martin said you had a good time on your honeymoon (aside from the big bruise
on your ass).? I did the same thing in New Braunfels several years ago.? It
looked worse than it felt.? Oh, could you give me Martin's email address at
work?? Kevin keeps meaning to get back with him about his father's
employment situation.? I'll make sure he does that tomorrow.

I'm sending some wedding photos.? I'll have to send only a few at a time, so
you will see other messages from me.? Let me know if you want to have any of
them printed up.

Steph

Cheryl, I was in your store on 9/23/00 and saw some Bernhardt furniture I am 
interested in.  It is the Paris Collection Dining Table and Chairs and the 
numbers are:

346-242  Table
346-244  Base
346-502  Air Chair (4)
346-501  Side Chair

Also I am interested in one of the two beds in the Paris Collection:

346-435  Sleigh Bed 5-0

346-527  Metal Canopy 5-0
346-457  Poster Bed 5-0
346-416  Poster Headboard 4-6 thru 5-0

On the second bed I am not sure if you need all three pieces or not so it 
would help if you could tell me what is the difference between the three 
pieces.  Finally, I am interested in an amroire and chest of draws (there are 
several depending if I go with a granite top or not):
346-144  Armoire
346-237  Right Stone Top
346-236  Right Bachelor's Chest Base
346-235  Right Bachelor'e Chest
346-042  Dressing Chest
346-044  Dressing Chest Stone Top
346-043  Dressing Chest Base

I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow.  If it is easier you can email 
me with the prices and then call to go over the info (instead of having to 
give 15 prices).  My work number is 713-853-5933.

Thanks,

Martin Cuilla

Subject: Procedures for Incremental Empire Gas for On-Peak Day Ahead Market

Marty suggested that I get these discussions kicked off on your side while he 
was
out-of-town today.  Basically, I started off with your proposed procedures 
and made
a few changes that Enron needs to make sure that right amount of gas shows up 
at the
correct time.

Also, we are suggesting a confirmation form be sent back and forth between 
Enron and
Sithe every day.  This will help document all the small little details and 
costs so that we
both drop anything through the cracks.  I am suggesting that we e-mail this 
confirm form
to the right folks in both our companies, so that no one is left out of the 
loop.

You will also notice our attempt to make sure that everyone has a clear 
understanding
of exactly what is included in the numbers that are reported to Enron's 
traders.  The timing
of your calls will be when everyone is very busy in our trading group.  There 
will not be much
time to have long conversations, but it is very important that everyone have 
the same
understanding what the numbers mean.

Please take a look at this on your side and see if there are some other 
things that need to
be included.

Thanks,

Ruth

Martin - You gave me Jeff George rather than Eddie George. - I don't want to 
use all my points to pick him back up in Free Agency.

QB - Steve McNair
RB - Jeff George
RB - Tim Biak.
WR - Iasaac Bruce
WR - Tim Brown
WR - Jerry Rice
K & D - Tennessee

Why do I like my team better than those 2nd place - NY Tailors?

My add drops haven't been approved, so here's my  official lineup:
?
QB???? Beurlein
RB???? Wheatley
RB???? Smith
WR??? Robinson
WR??? Morton
WR??? Ward
K??????  Detroit
D?????? New Orleans?
?
I can't log on to the CBS Sportsline server, and  I'm on my way out to play 
golf, so if any of the above wide receivers are on  bye, Gonzalez is the 
starter instead of them (but I think all those receivers  are playing).
?
Bench:
QB??? Plummer???  bye
RB???  James??????? bye
RB??? Chauncey
WR??? Gonzalez
WR??? Sanders???  bye
WR???  Mathis??????? may be injured
?

Bobby

We are very happy that you will be participating in the celebration of our 
marriage!  Attached is a copy of the reading we selected for you to read.  
Please read it over and if you have any questions you can reach me at 
713-853-5933 or Zooey at home 713-432-7163 or cell 713-516-8820.  I 
understand you won't be in town for the rehearsal so we look forward to 
seeing you before the wedding.  I am not sure when we are all meeting up but 
Zooey or I will talk to you on Saturday afternoon about the ceremony and when 
the reading will take place.  Thanks again for your help.

Martin

again thank you  for
your business.

Looking at Earnings estimates I think they are under estimating the long term 
shift in natural gas prices.  90 days ago they had next year earnings $.17 
under this year
and only resently have they started to raise 2001 earnings to account for 
were prices are.  I image that are still under estimating next year earnings 
based on where
the strip of natural gas is.  I don't think most people expected gas next 
summer to be trading over $4.55

The winner of the 9/15 Dave Matthews Tickets accidently bid on both pairs of 
tickets I had for sale (9/15 and 9/16) and only wanted one pair.  He is 
buying the 9/16 tickets (11th row) for $345.  If you are interested in the 
9/15 tickets (8th row) which are even better seats, I can sell them to you 
for $305.  Let me know asap because I am leaving town around 2pm for the 
weekend.  You can reach me at work or anytime this weekend on my cell phone.  
If you are interested please call me at 713-853-5933 (work) or 713-516-8820 
(cell) and we will work it out.  FYI - I am also notifying the person who bid 
$305 and promised to give them first look but otherwise the tickets are your 
if you want.

Thanks,

Martin
