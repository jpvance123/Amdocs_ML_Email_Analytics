Here is what we are proposing as the new rules for evaluating the transport contracts for rejection/release.  The Creditor Committee is reviewing the draft and hopefully it will be presented at the next meeting.

MRT considers both of these contracts to be Maximum Rate FTS agreements.  All current shippers on MRT receive a prorata share of the Settlement Discount.  The pipeline completed that rate case settlement in November 2001.  MRT cannot file another rate case for at least three years and is not obligated to file a rate case by a stipulated date.  Therefore, for the remaining term of these agreements the Settlement Discount will be in place.

For K# 434:
	Monthly Reservation w/ Settlement Discount is $15,811.58
	Estimated Reservation Charges To Be Paid through End of Term is $411,100
		( 26 months from Apr 02 through May 04 )
For K# 416:
	Monthly Reservation w/ Settlement Discount is $2,238.48
	Estimated Reservation Charges To Be Paid through End of Term is $69,400
		( 26 months from Apr 02 through Oct 04 )

I also received the letter you requested that documents the particulars of EEM picking up the contract from PG&E Energy Services.

Thanks for your help,
Ruth

Hi Ruth,
I don't want to harass you, but if you have the MRT demand charge info,
monthly and for the primary term, I would like to have it. I called
Steve Mahon and he apparently wants to speak with me and Mark today. If
possible, I want to keep MRT in play as part of the discussion and have
all th necessary info.

Also, let me know whether it would create any problems for you if I work
from DC tomorrow and Friday?
Shemin

Shemin,

I got the information you requested so that you could revise MRT's permanent release instruction letter.  Time may be of the essence on Monday morning.  Assuming we get the official word on approval from the Creditor Committee early Monday morning, we will need to be in a position to send the revised letter back to MRT late Monday morning.  Basically I begged them to give us until Monday afternoon before the Motion is filed.

Here is the information:

K# 416		Enron Energy Marketing Company
		Termination Date of 10/31/2004
		577 Dth/day MDQ
		Maximum FTS Tariff Rate
		Evergreen and ROFR Rights

K# 434		Enron Energy Services
		Termination Date of 15/31/2004
		3,583 Dth/day MDQ
		Maximum FTS Tariff Rate
		Evergreen and ROFR Rights

MRT has found three counter-parties willing to step into EES's and EEM's contract obligations via permanent capacity releases.  They are National Steel; Village of Dupo, Illinois; and City of Waterloo, Illinois.

With respect to K # 416 and the unusual Enron counter-party name.  EES purchased PG&E Energy Services gas book several years ago.  This MRT transportation contract was a part of that gas book of transactions.  It is probably because of this acquisition that a different EES counter-party was used.  MRT confirms that this contract has a counter=party name of Enron Energy Marketing Company (Duns #941565582).

An effective date of April 1, 2002 for the permanent releases is still everyone's goal.

Thanks,

Ruth Concannon

Shemin,

Here is a draft instruction letter that MRT prepared in anticipation of hearing that everything was approved by the Creditor's Committee.  I will double check the contract numbers and entity names this afternoon and will let you know if they don't match up with the letter.  Also, we will need to change the date of the letter and put it on EES/EEM or Enron Corp. letterhead.

Thanks for your help and keep your fingers crossed that the Committee says yes,
Ruth
