Toni:  Debra is a nice enough person, but does not really fit our needs.  She 
did not seem to fully understand what our job would entail, and I had a hard 
time figuring out what she does now.  She does not seem to possess the energ 
y level or the sense of urgency our job requires.  She is clearly not a hire 
from my perspective.  Call me if you need anything else.

Nominations:<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hard to believe, but another year

Darwin Awards are awarded every year to the
person(s)<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who died (or almost died) in the
stupidest way, thus enhancing the<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gene pool by
their absence.<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 2000 nominees
are:<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOMINEE No. 1: [San Jose Mercury
News]:<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An unidentified man, using a shotgun
like a club to break a former<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; girlfriend's
windshield, accidentally shot himself to death
when<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the gun discharged, blowing a hole in his
gut<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOMINEE No. 2: [Kalamazoo
Gazette]<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; James Burns, 34, (a mechanic) of
Alamo, Mich., was killed in March<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as he was
trying to repair what police describe as a "farm
type<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; truck." Burns got a friend to drive the
truck on a highway while<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Burns hung underneath
so that he could ascertain the source of a<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
troubling noise. Burns' clothes caught on something, however,
and<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the other man found Burns "wrapped in the
drive shaft."<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOMINEE No. 3:
[Hickory Daily Record]<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ken Charles Barger, 47,
accidentally shot himself to death in<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; December
in Newton, N.C. Awakening to the sound of a
ringing<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; telephone beside his bed, he reached
for the phone but grabbed<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; instead a Smith
Wesson .38 Special, which discharged when he
drew<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it to his
ear.<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOMINEE No. 4: [UPI,
Toronto]<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Police said a lawyer demonstrating
the safety of windows in a<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; downtown Toronto
skyscraper crashed through a pane with his<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
shoulder and plunged 24&nbsp; floors to his death. A police
spokesman<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; said Garry Hoy, 39, fell into the
courtyard of the Toronto<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dominion Bank Tower
early Friday evening as he was explaining the<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
strength of the building's windows to visiting law students.
Hoy<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; previously has conducted demonstration of
window strength<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; according to police reports.
Peter Lawyers, managing partner of<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the firm
Holden Day Wilson, told the Toronto Sun newspaper
that<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hoy was "one of the best and brightest"
members of the 200-man<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
association.<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOMINEE No. 5:
[Bloomsburg News Service]<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A terrible diet and
room with no ventilation are being blamed for<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the death of a man who was killed by his own gas. There was
no<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mark on his body but an autopsy showed
large amounts of methane<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gas in his system.
His diet had consisted primarily of beans and<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
cabbage (and a couple of other things). It was just the
right<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; combination of foods. It appears that
the man died in his sleep<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from breathing the
poisonous cloud that was hanging over his bed.<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Had he been outside or had his windows been opened, it
wouldn't<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have been fatal.&nbsp; But the man
was shut up in his near air-tight<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
bedroom.&nbsp; According to the article, "He was a big man with a
huge<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; capacity for creating "this deadly gas."
Three of the rescuers got<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sick and one was
hospitalized.<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOMINEE No. 6: [The
News of the Weird.]<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Michael Anderson Godwin
made news of the Weird posthumously. He<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; had
spent several years awaiting South Carolina's electric
chair<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on a murder conviction before having his
sentence reduced to life<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in prison. Whilst
sitting on a metal toilet in his cell and<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
attempting to fix his small TV set, he bit into a wire and
was<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
electrocuted.<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOMINEE NO. 7: ["The
Indianapolis Star"].<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A cigarette lighter may
have triggered fatal explosion in Dunkirk,<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Indiana.&nbsp; A Jay County man using a cigarette lighter to check
the<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; barrel of a muzzle loader was killed
Monday night when the weapon<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; discharged in his
face, sheriff's investigators said. Gregory<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
David Pryor, 19, died in his parents' rural Dunkirk home
about<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11:30 pm.&nbsp; Investigators said Pryor
was cleaning a 54-caliber<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; muzzle loader that
had not been firing properly. He was using the<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
lighter to look into the barrel when the gunpowder

was standing on a wheeled chair when the
accident<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; occurred, said Inspector D'Arcy Honer
of the Peel regional police.<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It appears the
chair moved and he went over the balcony,"
Honer<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
said.<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOMINEE No.9: [Arkansas
Democrat Gazette] Two local men were<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seriously
injured when their pick-up truck left the road
and<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; struck a tree near Cotton Patch on State
Highway 38 early Monday<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; morning. Woodruff
County deputy Dovey Snyder reported the
accident<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shortly after midnight Monday.
Thurston Poole, 33, of Des Arc and<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Billy Ray
Wallis, 38, of Little Rock are listed in
serious<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; condition at Baptist Medical Center.
The accident occurred as the<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; two men were
returning to Des Arc after a frog gigging trip. On
an<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; overcast Sunday night, Poole's pick-up
truck headlights<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; malfunctioned.&nbsp; The two
men concluded that the headlight fuse on<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the
older model truck had burned out. As a replacement fuse
was<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not available,&nbsp; Wallis noticed that
the .22 caliber bullet from<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his pistol fit
perfectly into the fuse box next to the
steering<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wheel column.&nbsp; Upon inserting
the bullet, the headlights again<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; began to
operate properly and the two men proceeded on
east-bound<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; toward the White River bridge.
After traveling approximately 20<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; miles and
just before crossing the river, the bullet
apparently<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; overheated, discharged and struck
Poole in the right testicle. The<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vehicle
swerved sharply to the right exiting the pavement
and<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; striking a tree. Poole suffered only minor
cuts and abrasions from<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the accident, but will
require surgery to repair the other wound.<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Wallis sustained a broken clavicle and was treated and
released.<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank God we weren't on that bridge
when Thurston shot his balls<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; off or we might
both be dead" stated Wallis. "I've been a
trooper<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for ten years in this part of the
world, but this is a first for<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me. I can't
believe that those two would admit how this
accident<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; happened," said Snyder.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Upon being notified of the wreck,<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lavinia,
Poole's wife, asked how many frogs the boys had
caught<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and did anyone get them from the
truck.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Way to go,
Lavinia!)<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt;<BR><BR><BR>

Hi Mike,

Thanks for the update.  Unfortunately, the Civic Club is unable to run the
article in The Islander, because of its political nature.  President Kathleen
Gay reviewed the article, as it was previously written, and advised me last
night that it is against Civic Club policy and bylaws to be involved in
political issues.

If you have questions or comments, please contact Kathleen.

Subject: Penalties

Stacy Dickson called, and she said penalties for non-performance in the past 
have been handled by supplying information to Legal and they will then write 
a letter to the counterparty stating that per the contract you were supposed 
to deliver X but you didn't perform, so now you owe us $Y.  I asked her what 
she would need to do this and she gave me the following list of items.  
Please coordinate getting this to her - the spreadsheet you prepared may 
already have the volume comparison, prices, and penalty calc in it - we just 
need to get copies of the confirms and contracts.  Let me know if you have 
any questions.  Thanks.

Counterparty Legal Name
Copy of contract
Confirm
Actual Volumes
Prices (prob gas daily)
Amount we think the penalty should be

Subject: Unify stress test next week with Sybase 12.0

We have done some preliminary testing of the latest version of Sybase 
(version 12).  We have seen very positive results from our initial tests and 
would like to proceed with a "stress test" (not to be confused with me 
showing up each day at work).  We would like to do 2 tests next week due to 
hardware and business restrictions.

The test would be similar to those from late-1998 (ah, those were the 
days!).  We will ask all users, as well as I.T. folks, to run as many of 
their usual processing during a scripted time frame from approx noon - 1:30pm 
on Tuesday and Wednesday. Be sure to order some yummy pizza or sandwiches for 
your staff!

The Sybase 12.0 environment can be accessed via Start/Programs/Test 
Applications/Unify Applications/Unify Gas-Power Stage.  On the Login window, 
select server = "ASE 12 Test".  If you usual Production password does not 
work, try "houston".  If that does not work, try a neighbor's (Audit says 
that fine, its just a test).  Each user should plan to run several sessions 
where permissible to simulate a heavy load on the system and to make up for 
those not able to participate during this time.  Please have your staff try 
to login some time Monday to insure they have access.

The test script during the time period will be:
12:00 - 1:30 Logistics:  pathing, nominating, running some reports
12:20 - 1:30 Volume Management: do your thing
12:40 - 1:30 Settlements/Accounting:  pile in

Please let me know if your area would NOT be able to assist in this very 
important test.  The results of these 2 tests will dictate whether we should 
pursue our migration to this new release in mid-July.  The less bid weeks 
with poor system performance the better!

Thanks in advance for your help, d.n.

Subject: Re: Jokes



Here are some one-liners for people to enjoy, maybe you've heard them but
I'm a BIG Rodney fan.

Bu-bye

Rodney Dangerfield's Material...
 _______________________________________

 I was so poor growing up...If I wasn't born a boy.... I'd have nothing to
 play with.

 A girl phoned me the other day and said .... "Come on over, there's nobody
 home." I went over. Nobody was home.

 During sex, my girlfriend always wants to talk to me. Just the other night
 she called me from a hotel.

 One day as I came home early from work ..... I saw a guy jogging naked. I
 said to the guy .... "Hey buddy, why are you doing that?" He said,
 "Because you came home early."

 Its been a rough day. I got up this morning ... put on a shirt and a
 button fell off. I picked up my briefcase, and the handle came off. I'm
 afraid
 to go to the bathroom.

 I was such an ugly kid........When I played in the sandbox the cat kept
 covering me up.

 I could tell that my parents hated me. My bath toys were a toaster and a
 radio.

 I was such an ugly baby ... My mother never breast fed me. She told me
 that she only liked me as a friend.

 I'm so ugly ... My father carries around the picture of the kid who came
 with his wallet.

 When I was born .... the doctor came out to the waiting room and said to my
 father "I'm very sorry.......We did everything we could......But he pulled
 through."

 I'm so ugly ... My mother had morning sickness.......AFTER I was born.

 I remember the time I was kidnapped and they sent a piece of my finger to
 my father. He said he wanted more proof.

 Once when I was lost ..... I saw a policeman and asked him to help me find
 my parents. I said to him .... "Do you think we'll ever find them?" He said
 "I don't know kid ... there are so many places they can hide."

 My wife made me join a bridge club. I jump off next Tuesday.

 I'm so ugly ... I worked in a pet shop, and people kept asking how big I'd
 get.

 I went to see my doctor. "Doctor, every morning when I get up and look in
 the mirror, I feel like throwing up. What's wrong with me?" He said "I
 don't know but your eyesight is perfect."

 I went to the doctor because I'd swallowed a bottle of sleeping pills. My
 doctor told me to have a few drinks and get some rest.

Bob:  the only other thing I might add is that it makes a record of confirmed 
nomination information that may help in discrepancies (wrong contract #'s, 
etc.).  Otherwise, this is a great starting point.

Hey guys:  just to follow up after our discussion this morning on unfinaled 
invoices, the following will be our procedures.

10th day of month:  invoices sent out
1st business day after 10th:  we will get the unfinaled invoice report from 
settlements and start working on clearing all discrepancies.  We will have 
all discrepancies cleared by the 5th work day after the 10th.
25th day of month:  purchase stuff goes out.
1st work day after 25th:  unfinaled invoice report from settlements, same 
timetable to clear all discrepancies.

Remember:  a discrepancy will consist of anything that could hold an invoice 
from going out the door.  
We need to be very receptive to other groups in helping them clear these up.  
We know more about these deals than anyone, so let's be helpful.
Let's also try to clear these up in a way so as to avoid causing these 
problems in the future, if we can.  

Thanks in advance for everyone's help.

Guys:  currently the system is designed to match upstreams and downstreams 
for buy/sells in contract exchange, and the scheduler would then recreate 
these paths in Unify.  In my opinion this does not guarantee data integrity 
between the systems.  Carrie and I have scheduled a meeting for 1:30 pm today 
in 21c2 to discuss.  Please feel free to attend and give your opinions.

Subject: "Auto-Pathing" Buy/Sells

Hello!

Randy and I were discussing some additional functionality after the meeting 
today. . .

Is there any reason that we could NOT automate the creation of the buy/sell 
or brokered paths in UNIFY once the deals have been matched in the Contract 
Exchange module?  Will the Contract Exchange module contain enough 
information to create the UNIFY path just a scheduler would?  

In other words, is the path creation process for buy/sell deals only manual 
"re-entry" of the data that will be sitting out in Contract Exchange?  OR is 
there additional information that you need to create the path that is not 
sitting in Contract Exchange?

This, of course, assumes that the meter has been added to the deal in 
Contract Exchange and the deal has bridged from SITARA to UNIFY.

It seems to us that this should be possible and valuable, but please give us 
your input!

Thanks,
Carrie

All - FYI, I would suggest copying this and keeping it handy so you can use 
off-hours when necessary (even though the help desk should do the contacting)


Alex - See me about this. I would like some of this info added to the second

Susan,

I am planning to set up an on-call pager and cell phone for Unify Logistics.  
In the meanwhile, please use the following for any Unify Logistics support 
call you may receive:

Seq Name   Home  Pager   Cell
1) On Call Pager    713-284-3757 (not yet activated)
2) Dave Nommensen 281-558-9145 1-888-487-1865  713-562-3986
3) Dave McMullan  281-855-4106 713-285-4982
4) Trisha Luong  281-565-8149 713-285-8715
5) Diane Niestrath  713-682-7416 713-525-0334
6) Benedicta (BT) Tung 281-565-9669 713-285-0931

There are several subsystems within Unify.  The above list is strictly 
related to Unify Logistics.  They are they guys that schedule gas on a 7 X 24 
basis.
This does NOT cover the guys in Unify that do Settlements.

Once I have the on-call pager activated, I will let you know.

Thanks, d.n.

Subject: Fwd: GE Letter Agreement


Alan,

In response to your e-mail, the Letter Agreement has not been further revised 
since I sent it to you on March 30th (that e-mail is attached hereto).

The open issues relate to the following items in Attachment 8 which contains 
certain provisions to be used as part of the "Base Agreement:"

1.  The issue detailed in the attached of whether WestLB will indemnify GEII 
against actions of the Enron entity acting as "Agent."  Rob Gay is reviewing 
this issue.  This issue would impact Section 20.1(a).

2.  The inclusion of certain language that Enron has requested which would 
more clearly establish that GEII's indemnity obligation includes 
consequential damage claims by third parties.  The language at issue appears 
in Sections 20.1(b) and 27.2.

At Brett Wiggs' request, Cheryl Costa is discussing the above issues with 
GEII.  If you have any questions or comments or would like to discuss the 
foregoing, please contact me at 713-655-5102.

please feel free to contact me at 713-655-5102.

Rob,

Attached please find the current draft of the Letter Agreement (32581.7), 
including Attachment 8 (32573.7) which sets forth various provisions to be 
included in the Purchase Agreement.  Article 20 regarding indemnification is 
included in Attachment 8.

As we discussed, West LB has some concerns regarding including language in 
Article 20 which GEII requested by which West LB would indemnify GEII for 
Enron's acts (in its capacity as Agent).  West LB has suggested they would be 
willing to undertake this obligation if they are reimbursed by Enron through 
the Acquisition and Development Agreement.  Today, for the first time, West 
LB indicated that they may require a cap on this liability for Agent's acts 
in the Purchase Agreement.

GEII has requested that West LB undertake this obligation and Enron has 
agreed to pursue it with West LB.  In light of this, the language which would 
establish West LB's indemnity obligation for the Agent's acts is not included 
in the current draft of Attachment 8.

Please let me know how you would like to proceed.  As I mentioned, we are 
trying to finalize the Letter Agreement with GEII very shortly.  I apologize 
for any confusion and look forward to working with you on this matter.  If 
you have any questions or would like to discuss this matter further, please 
feel free to contact me at 713-655-5102.

Thanks,
Vanessa.

Mr. Gay,

My name is Daniel Lisk, your new Gas Scheduler.  I'm slated to begin work on
the Monday the 18th, and must say I am VERY excited to get started.  It will
be an honor to work for Enron.  I know I am just beginning a long and
productive career with an amazing company.

I received your email address from Molly Magee.  I had a few questions
regarding Holiday plans and start-day preparation and she directed me to
this email address.  I know you are very busy, so please reply at your
convenience.

My first question regards holiday planning.  If I remember correctly, it was
mentioned someone was working or on call one weekend a month.  It may be too
early to tell, but if I'm scheduled to work that weekend (December 22nd -
25th) I would like to make plans accordingly.  My mother in Missouri can be
very persistent (aka annoying) and wants to know my plans.

Also, I would like to put my name first on volunteers to work that weekend.
However, I understand my lack of experience may prevent me from accepting
that responsibility this soon.  If I will not be working, may I ask that you
tell me what days I will have off.  I need to know if I should buy a plane
ticket, get my car serviced for the drive, or make plans in Houston.

Finally, I've bought a training video covering Excel and begun reading a
book titled "Trading Natural Gas", by Fletcher J. Sturm (former senior
trader of natural gas derivatives for Enron Capital and Trade).  I want to
start contributing from day one and would like to know if there is anything
I can do to facilitate that.  Any other programs, books, push-up and
crunches, you could suggest would be aggressively pursued.

I look forward to seeing you again next week Mr. Gay.  My schedule on Monday
appears to be; "New Hire Training" from 8:00 am to 4:00 pm.  If possible, I
can be on your floor early to observe, leave for training from 8 to 4, then
return at 4:10 pm and stay until the close of business if you like?

Thank you.

Respectfully,



Daniel D. Lisk

Phillip:  the changes I would like to make are to promote Patti to Manager 
whenever you feel the time is right, and then I am going to recommend Stacey 
for promotion to Sr. Specialist based on her recent performances.  I also 
would like to be able to use the bonus system this year to reward some of the 
people who have been here the last couple of years.  It seems like we have to 
keep paying outside people more and we don't get to reward the experienced 
people who stick with us enough.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks.

Bob:  we probably need to get everyone together on this and come up with a 
consolidated stance before we go outside the group.  As you pointed out, 
there are several areas that could open us up to potential problems.  We want 
ot be careful not to get things out in the iopen that we do not want out.  
Thanks.

Hello,

We had trouble calc'ing our BC Physical books yesterday and pinponted it to 
this deal, which had an addition yesterday.
In order to get a calc. we deleted the day from the deal. This of course will 
go back in, and I just wanted to let you know what is happening.
The deal was for 111 MMBTU's; EC - IM Canada BC buying from ENA - IM West; 
the entry was dated 05/24/00 to PGEN/KINGSGATE/KING from PGEN/KINGSGATE/KING 
for a fee of NOVA_AECO-DAILY-US-CGPR...   

I have let Rich Gebauer know about it on our end. 

Have a great weekend.

Brian.

   Randy, 

   Please confirm by forwarding this email to Veronica Thompson in Accounts 
Payable...

   That you agree Patti Sullivan did not go as planned to Colorado Springs 
and should be reimbursed the 
   amount of $242.17 for those charges that were billed to her American 
Express.  

    Thank you,

Randy,

Here are the instructions for the TS update.  I just ran it here on my pc and 
everything works fine.

1. go to http:\\remoteservices.enron.com
2. click here
3. save program to c:\
4. double click on citrixclient.exe after it has been downloaded.

This will add a Terminal Server icon to the desktop.  Double click on this to 
launch the new version of TS.

Thanks,
KG

Bob:   I am still wonderring why the external modems my group had were 
removed.  It seems like I am always having to order modems and accessories 
every time we move anyone.  Since we are getting ready to move again, maybe 
we should get an inventory of everything each logistic's person has at their 
workstation, and this is what should be moved.

Subject: GE Letter Agreement


Rob,

Attached please find the current draft of the Letter Agreement (32581.7), 
including Attachment 8 (32573.7) which sets forth various provisions to be 
included in the Purchase Agreement.  Article 20 regarding indemnification is 
included in Attachment 8.

As we discussed, West LB has some concerns regarding including language in 
Article 20 which GEII requested by which West LB would indemnify GEII for 
Enron's acts (in its capacity as Agent).  West LB has suggested they would be 
willing to undertake this obligation if they are reimbursed by Enron through 
the Acquisition and Development Agreement.  Today, for the first time, West 
LB indicated that they may require a cap on this liability for Agent's acts 
in the Purchase Agreement.

GEII has requested that West LB undertake this obligation and Enron has 
agreed to pursue it with West LB.  In light of this, the language which would 
establish West LB's indemnity obligation for the Agent's acts is not included 
in the current draft of Attachment 8.

Please let me know how you would like to proceed.  As I mentioned, we are 
trying to finalize the Letter Agreement with GEII very shortly.  I apologize 
for any confusion and look forward to working with you on this matter.  If 
you have any questions or would like to discuss this matter further, please 
feel free to contact me at 713-655-5102.

Thanks,
Vanessa.

Highway 38 early Monday<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; morning. Woodruff
County deputy Dovey Snyder reported the
accident<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shortly after midnight Monday.
Thurston Poole, 33, of Des Arc and<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Billy Ray
Wallis, 38, of Little Rock are listed in
serious<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; condition at Baptist Medical Center.
The accident occurred as the<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; two men were
returning to Des Arc after a frog gigging trip. On
an<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; overcast Sunday night, Poole's pick-up
truck headlights<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; malfunctioned.&nbsp; The two
men concluded that the headlight fuse on<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the

the bullet, the headlights again<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; began to
operate properly and the two men proceeded on
east-bound<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; toward the White River bridge.
After traveling approximately 20<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; miles and
just before crossing the river, the bullet
apparently<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; overheated, discharged and struck
Poole in the right testicle. The<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vehicle
swerved sharply to the right exiting the pavement
and<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; striking a tree. Poole suffered only minor
cuts and abrasions from<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the accident, but will
require surgery to repair the other wound.<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Wallis sustained a broken clavicle and was treated and
released.<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank God we weren't on that bridge
when Thurston shot his balls<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; off or we might
both be dead" stated Wallis. "I've been a

caught<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and did anyone get them from the
truck.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Way to go,

Randy, 
We are in the process of setting up the following locations in red below in 
EOL as requested by Frank Ermis.
We need to get the pipe , zone (both required) and meter, if applicable, 
commercial would like these locations mapped into Sitara.
In order for these locations to flow into position manager in Sitara 
automatically (instead of manuelly entered) when these locations are hit on 
EOL, 
we need this information. Can you provide this information as soon as 
possible?

Thank you for your help!

Subject: New Phys Gas Locations

Frank would like to see the following 3 Locations approved from trading:

First:

Opal; which is already set up as a Location and is out in DRAFT. Dave, I've 
already asked Frank to have Jeff Shankman look at thh product and offer 
approval. Please review.

Then:

Location: PGT Malin
Abbreviation: PGT Malin
Sort Code: 2850
Description: The transaction is for delivery at Pacific Gas Transmission 
Company - Malin.

Location: PG&E Pool
Abbreviation: PG&E Pool
Sort Code: 2840
Description: The transaction is for delivery at Pacific Gas & Electric 
Company - City Gate Pool Gas.

Jennifer; can you check with the logistics guys and make sure these are good 
points and descriptions. Malin Lines 400 and 401 are no longer used, and PGE 
is City Gate Pool Gas.


Frank, if you could review the descriptions also and offer comments I'd 
appreciate it.

Read this, guys..it's really funny.? The format isn't exactly pretty, but 
you'll be able to figure it out: 
? 

The Real Debate 

Jim Lehrer:???? Welcome to the second presidential debate between Vice 
President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush. The candidates have agreed on 
these rules:? I will ask a question. The candidate will ignore the question 
and deliver rehearsed remarks 
designed to appeal to undecided women voters. 
The opponent will then have one minute to respond by trying to frighten 
senior citizens into voting for him. 
When a speaker's time has expired, I will whimper softly while he 
continues 
to spew incomprehensible statistics for three more minutes. 

Let's start with the vice president. Mr. Gore, can you give us the name 
of 
a downtrodden citizen and then tell us his or her story in a way that 
strains the bounds of common sense? 

Gore:??????????? As I was saying to Tipper last night after we tenderly 
made???????????? love the way we have so often during the 30 years of 
our 
rock-solid marriage, the downtrodden have a clear choice in this 
election. 
My opponent wants to cut taxes for the richest 1 percent of Americans. 

I, on the other hand, want to put the richest 1 percent in an iron clad 
lock box so they can't hurt old people like Roberta Frampinhamper, who 
is 
here tonight. Mrs. Frampinhamperhas been selling her internal organs, 
one 
by one, to pay for gas so that she can travel to these debates and 
personify problems for me. 

Also, her poodle has arthritis. 

Lehrer:??? Gov. Bush, your rebuttal. 

Bush:???? Governors are on the front lines every day, hugging people, 
crying with them, relieving suffering anywhere a photo opportunity 
exists.? I want to empower those crying people to make their own 
decisions, 
unlike my opponent, whose mother is not Barbara Bush. 

Lehrer:??? Let's turn to foreign affairs. Gov. Bush, if Slobodan 
Milosevic 
were to launch a bid to return to power in Yugoslavia, would you be able 
to 
pronounce his name? 

Bush:??????? The current administration had eight years to deal with 
that 
guy and didn't get it done. If I'm elected, the first thing I would do 
about that guy is have Dick Cheney confer with our allies. And then Dick 
would present me several options for dealing with that guy. And then 
Dick 
would tell me which one to choose. 

You know, as governor of Texas, I have to make tough foreign policy 
decisions every day about how we're going to deal with New Mexico. 

Lehrer:??? Mr. Gore, your rebuttal. 

Gore:??????? Foreign policy is something I've always been keenly 
interested 
in. I served my country in Vietnam. I had an uncle who was a victim of 
poison gas in World War I.? I myself lost a leg in the Franco-Prussian 
War. 
And when that war was over, I came home and tenderly made love to Tipper 
in 
a way that any undecided woman voter would find romantic. 

If I'm entrusted with the office of president, I pledge to deal 
knowledgeably with any threat, foreign or domestic, by putting it in an 
iron clad lock box. 

Because the American people deserve a president who can comfort them 
with 
simple metaphors. 

Lehrer:??? Vice President Gore, how would you reform the Social Security 
system? 

Gore:??????? It's a vital issue, Jim. That's why Joe Lieberman and I 
have 
proposed changing the laws of mathematics to allow us to give $50,000 to 
every senior citizen without having it cost the federal treasury a 
single 
penny until the year 2250. In addition, my budget commits $60 trillion 
over 
the next 10 years to guarantee that all senior citizens can have drugs 
delivered free to their homes every Monday by a federal employee who 
will 
also help them with the child-proof cap. 

Lehrer:??? Gov. Bush? 

Bush:??????? That's fuzzy math. I know, because as governor of Texas, I 
have to do math every day. I have to add up the numbers and decide 
whether 
I'm going to fill potholes out on Rt. 36 east of Abilene or commit funds 
to 
reroof the sheep barn at the Texas state fairgrounds. 

Lehrer:??? It's time for closing statements. 

Gore:??????? I'm my own man. I may not be the most exciting politician, 
but 
I will fight for the working families of America, in addition to turning 
the White House into a lusty pit of marital love for Tipper and me. 

Bush:??????? It's time to put aside the partisanship of the past by 
electing no one but Republicans. 

Lehrer:??? Good night.

Hi Kathleen, Randy and Chris,

I've made some headway this afternoon.  Juanita gave me info on Alma Roeshot
so a short article can be inserted.  Joh Scott gave me info on the upcoming
water board and I'd like to include that article, with your okay, Kathleen.

Still don't know who lives at 509 Narcissus, but Juanita explained all that
was involved!

Looking forward to a quick response!

Thanks,
'Nita

Please forward to logistics in your region......

Would any of the desks be opposed to enabling Unify to default the 
Destination rankings to the same rankings that are created in the Source 
rankings.  There would still be the ability to change to ranking on the 
Destination side however, it would not  affect the rankings on the Source 
side.  This will save time pathing and prevent the amount of data entry 
errors.   Would you please forward comments to your manager.    Dave

of course.  You should probably sit with Stacey, because she has the most 
daisy chains and confirming to do.  Any day but Friday will do this week.  
Let me know.

I think we are on the right track from our meeting yesterday.  I talked to 
Patti today and she is confirming the way we want to do things from a users 
perspective.  My thought is that we get a good, general, working model as to 
how the information will flow, then take it back to our groups and go over 
different scenarios within each region, such as Opal Plant, Socal, etc.  We 
can see how the information will flow and see what we need to tinker with.

I also have a few questions we need to think about at some point, and I did 
not want to forget them.  

1.  When we make a change to an existing upstream/downstream contract, how 
will we notify the counterparties that a change has occurred.  

2.  Should we lock out our customer's at some time so they can't make changes 
at a late time?  We could do the rest over the phone.

3.  On EDI pipes, we could conceivably make changes up to 11:45 am, but it 
would affect customers whose noms are due at 11:30.  

I thought these were just questions we might want to think about.  I'm sure 
there are a lot of others.

Thanks.

Let me know what the procedure is (i.e. do I interview, will an anlyst just 
be assigned to me, etc.)  I had already talked to Mason Hamlin before, and he 
opted for another rotation, although he was perffectly acceptable to me.  So

Joe,

Late last year Lucy Ortiz gave me your name as the contact regarding gas 
sales under the APEA contract.  I have also been coordinating with Randy Gay 
in our Houston office regarding payments and deliveries.

We have been notified by Coral Energy, representing the City of Glendale, 
that effective December 1, 2000, Glendale wants to receive their entire 
quantity (4,178 MMBtu/d) at the Nova Inventory Transfer ("NIT") point.  This 
point is located in Alberta and will be supplied by Enron's Calgary office.

Can you please notify Chase Manhattan, for purposes of settling the swaps 
associated with this transaction, to settle at NIT for December 2001 and 
beyond, unless another notice is issued to us.

If you no longer have responsibility for managing these issues, could you 
please forward this to the correct person.

Thanks,

Laird Dyer (415.782.7805)

Phillip:  I agree with your conclusions, and we have already started 
addressing most of these issues.  

First of all, I would like to say that all of the schedulers are performing 
at a high level, except for Hillary and Jan.  We have formally addressed 
Hillary's performance problems, and he is on  a schedule for improvement or 
he is out.  We have informally addressed Jan's performance issues with her, 
and next week intend to formalize that also.  That Jan makes more than anyone 
else in the group makes her situation quite critical in my eyes, because we 
are not getting a return on that investment.

The rest of the group is paid based on lots of factors that you are already 
aware of, years of service, years in scheduling, level of performance, etc.  
In Stacey's particular case, I am recommending her for promotion at the end 
of the year, which will bump her pay scale up and make her pay more equitable 
with her job performance.  Also, I intend to help smooth over other 
inequities through the bonus pool.

In regards to Patti, I have recommended her for a bonus for her service 
during the rough time we've had when we were understaffed.  Bob Superty has 
supported this, and the information you provided him this last week should 
help in that endeavour.  Patti has had her pay increased this year after a 
salary survey was performed by our HR group.  I would like to point out that 
Patti is pretty well paid for someone with her experience level.  Also, Patti 
would move up in the pay scale if she is promoted to Manager.  I am not sure 
what the exact plan is for Patti and myself as far as how that will go.  I 
would like to say that I feel more comfortable being back as each day goes 
on, and am ready to make a move to trading anytime now if that is what you 
and Mike still want to do.  

As regards to the new hires:  yes, we can hire more like these at these 
prices.  We would love to have employees like Matt, and Ted and Shelly, 
especially at these prices.  Patti did an excellent job hiring these 
individuals.  We have already started the process of looking for more like 
these to start backfilling in for Hillary and Jan.  We also need to hire more 
for establishing a bigger physical presence in the west.  We probably need to 
sit down and go over with you and Mike as to what kind of plans you have for 
expanding the desk.  

Finally, I would like to bring up that Lucci has requested that the Denver 
office do all nominations for IM Denver deals.  This has met stiff resistance 
in the past, and I do not know how ya'll feel about it, but I promised that I 
would bring it up. I personally feel that Denver and CIG would be isolated 
from us if the operations were to move to Denver.  

If you have additional questions or comments please let me know.  Thanks.

Subject: revision to Path Manager Auto Refresh

Based on feedback from multi-scheduler pipes, the refreshing of paths can 
tend to slow down the other scheduer on the same pipe.  This is especially 
noticeable when many paths are changed at once.  Even if it takes 1 - 2 
seconds to refresh a path, changing 20 - 30 paths could cause the other 
scheduler on that pipe to wait for 30 - 45 seconds.

We are developing a revised Auto Refresh option to let the scheduler pick 
whether they want Deal changes or Path changes (or both or neither).  To the 
scheduler, it will simply be a change on the Path Manager filter to replace 
the "Auto Refresh" checkbox with two checkboxes:
 - Auto Refresh Deals
 - Auto Refresh Paths
Once selected, this will be the default selection for the duration of that 
Path Manager session just as the current selection works.

This will have no impact on how or when the data is stored in Unify, only 
whether another PC should have its numbers updated.  Nominations will process 
all paths regardless of this new selection.

If our testing goes well, we may actually migrate this change to Unify 
Production tonight.  Please let me know if you know of any reason we should 
not go forward with this plan or have any questions or concerns.

Thanks, d.n.

I want to send this to our customer, National Gypsum, but thought you
should review prior to it going out.  Do you have any comments?


I've talked with several people familar with gas sales and distribution in
the southwestern portion of the US.  Summarized below is their collective
response:

     1.   The pipeline capacity is limited due to an order by the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and FERC has jurisdiction over the
interstate sale and distribution of natural gas.  The Department of
Transportation has jursidiction only over certain safety issues resulting
from the gas explosion.
     2.   The spot market has risen in the Arizona area -- currently it is
at $  17.11__ for 30-day _Jan'01__.  The reason prices are high is due to the
excessive demand in California for natural gas for its power plants.  Thus,
gas is flowing into California -- the only way gas will flow east away from
California is in response to higher prices.
     3.   Enron is not "holding back supplies to the area".  Enron is not a
producer of natural gas, does not have ANY physical supplies, and does not
have or utilize storage capacity in this area.  Also, Enron controls
pipeline capacity over the El Paso Gas Pipeline of only 80,000 cf per day
-- this pipeline has a capacity of 4 BILLION cf per day (at full capacity).
The dominant holder of capacity on this pipleline is a gas marketing
subsidiary of El Paso Gas.  Moreover, there are numerous marketers of
natural gas in the area, ensuring competition and pricing visibility and
liquidity.  Thus, there is no way that Enron could control or influence the
price of physical suppliles in the area.
     4.   Gas trading generally occurs over monthly or seasonal (e.g.,
winter) periods, not annual periods.  And, the winter season for which
marketers generally quote prices is considered to be November to March (not
on December 1 as the note below suggests).
     5.   Finally, Enron would not want to hold back physical supplies to
the area.  Enron is primarily a trader of natural gas, engaged in the
buying and selling of the non-physical and financial side of natural gas
supplies.  Through Enron On Line, Enron is both a seller AND a buyer,
making margins on trades of positions in natural gas.   Thus, Enron would
be disadvantaged by not selling gas positions, even if it could hold back
physical supplies to the area, because it is not engaged in buying and
selling of positions in natural gas.

Rich,

The following information was included in an email that was sent to our
executives and CEO.  The tone leaves a negative impression for Enron.  Can
you or someone at Enron comment on Enron's role or lack thereof with
respect
to this item?  I am afraid this will taint our plans if not addressed
quickly.  I want to circulate Enron's side of the story.

Carol


Excerpt from email circulated today:

Due to the lingering effects of the August gas pipeline explosion in New
Mexico that killed 10 people, coupled with some possible market
manipulation
by Enron, we're facing a potential problem at Phoenix in the short term and
possibly all three western plants longer term.  The pipeline which is owned
by El Paso Gas is back in operation, but is being limited to 50% of
capacity.  Weather has turned cold, spiking demand for gas in the region.
Enron appears to be holding back supplies to the area until at least
December 1st, when many of its contracts set the index price for the
following year.  Consequently, gas prices on the spot market in Arizona are
hitting $25 per MMBTU.  The situation has caused several marketers to
declare force majeure.  If our marketer does so, we'll be curtailed.  As
you
probably know, we don't have any backup fuel capabilities at these three
plants.  The U.S. Dept of Transportation controls this and is reported to
be
getting involved.  Will keep you posted as it unfolds.

Melissa Raciti is asking whether we can hold the critical path call on
Friday rather than Wednesday.  Frank will be back from vacation tomorrow,
and the Lenders are hoping to use the 10am EDT time slot for an internal
call.  Does anyone object to this change in schedule?

Bob:  here is our status from this mornings outage event.

NWPL:  we were able to manually input 80% of next days nominations.  Since we 
were not able to EDI, we will have to manually input all successive 
nominations for the day, as well as all actual scheduled volumes in Unify.  
We were also only able to get in our 80% of nominations with NWPL's help, as 
they extended the nomination deadline for us.  The other 20% of next day 
business will be nominated as an intra-day.

El Paso:  basically the same as NWPL..  We were able to manually get in 100% 
of nominations, but only because El Paso kept their system open an extra hour 
for us.   

Let me know if you need aything else.  Thanks.

Dave:  my concern not only is with the outage on Sunday, but what may happen 
between Sunday and Tuesday.  With everything else going on, I would hate for 
my group to come in here on Tuesday and have problems on top of everything 
else.  We are going to be having a lot to do and I would feel more

Hi Kathleen, Randy, Chris, and Trish,

Attached is the text of the August issue of The Islander.  The headings will
be lined up when Trish adds the art and ads.  A calendar, also, which is in
the next e-mail.

I'll appreciate your comments by the end of tomorrow, Monday.

There are open issues which I sure hope get resolved before printing:

1.  I'm waiting for a reply from Mike Bass regarding tenses on the Home Depot
article.  Don't know if there's one developer or more and what the name(s)
is/are.

2.  Didn't hear back from Ted Weir regarding minutes for July's water board
meeting.  I think there are 2 meetings minutes missed, 6/22 and July.

3.  Waiting to hear back from Cheryl Hanks about the 7/6 City Council and 6/7
BOA meetings minutes.

4.  Don't know the name of the folks who were honored with Yard of the Month.
 They're at 509 Narcissus.

I'm not feeling very good about the missing parts but need to move on
schedule!  I'm also looking for a good dictionary to check the spellings of
ettouffe, tree-house and orneryness.  (Makes me feel kind of ornery, come to
think about it!)

Please let me know if you have revisions.  Hope your week is starting out
well.


'Nita

Bob:  not too many new ones.

1.  Continued to see increased volumes and transactions on desk.  As of 
November, we have increased volumes to over 5 Bcf/day, up from about 2 
Bcf/day last six month period.  We are continuing to handle month end close, 
and get all volumes scheduled daily.

2.  Continued to give support to the contract exchange project.  We have 
given my time and the resources from the group.

3.  Re-staffed the group after we lost some key, experienced personnel.  We 
have the new guys up and running and hope to really make some things happen 
from here on out.  

If I think of any thing else I will let you know.  Thanks.

Bob:  per your request, here is the rundown on Patti's activities for August 
and beyond.

1.  We calculated the amount we made on her experience in handling El Paso's 
transport to be close to $1 million/ month.

2.  I could not even begin to calculate the amount made just by having her 
here.  If Patti had just quit with everyone else gone, the amount lost on El 
Paso would be huge, including loss of credibility on our part with our 
customers.  The exact amount would be close to $1 million/month I would think.

3.  The spreads out West have been huge this summer.  We were able to take 
advantage of this because Patti was here to do the scheduling during a very 
difficult time.

4.  When I was out for the entire month of August, Patti was not only holding 
down a desk that usually three people handle, but was also filling in on 
management duties.  

5.  Patti worked 14 weeks in a row, including weekends, without taking a day 
off.  She worked at least 12 hours a day during this time, handling several 
different jobs at a time.

6.  The exact value of what Patti did is hard to determine.  I would estimate 
that her presence here and stepping in to help out was woth about $5 million 
to the desk.

Copom surprises with larger interest rates reduction

Yesterday night the Brazilian Monetary Policy Committee (COPOM) made a larger
than expected basic interest rates reduction. It came from 18.5% to 17.5% per
year level, setting downward bias until next meeting on July 18-19. This will 
at
least influence favorably the local markets, except foreign exchange in the
short run, boosting the mood of the society which may follow business leaders
who have already declared such one as a very positive move to the economic
growth side.

Assuming the move as first of others, despite not so large for the coming
months, consumers expectations may boost promoting additional economic growth 
in
the second semester. Argentina would eventually benefit in such scenario since
it may export more to Brazil, helping its difficult situation by generation of
additional reserves.

At this moment, what local players are trying to do is to understand the
rational of such move, which overcome the forecast of even the most optimistic
of the analysts.

The authority to justify the stronger move mentioned inflation forecasts
declining. The last inflation targeting report of the Central Bank shows a
forecast of 6.3% for the official index the IPCA in comparison with the
inflation-target of 6% for 2000 year. In fact, the new forecast in the market 
is
5.5% for 2000, in the best view. Additionally, the last inflation targeting
report shows a forecast of 3.3% against a target of 4% for 2001 year. However,
market argues that this do not justifies the intensity of the decline, 100 
basis
points against markets maximum expectation of a 50 bp reduction. So, there 
must
be other reasons to be understood.

We can list some other positive reasons. Fiscal primary surplus performance is
overcoming even the IMF goals. The cost of funding abroad is declining, as 
shown
by yesterday?s successful sovereign placement of an EUR 750 millions Eurobond 
to
yield 9.2%, comparably less than last September similar issue at 11.53%. We
could include the better mood on the US economic growth adjustment; Argentina
resistance to change the dollar pegged currency regime by new fiscal measures
and some better mood in the world growth as potential factors affecting
expectations. However, even all that does not justify the COPOM move for the
majority of local market makers. They agree in the direction of the move, but
not on the intensity and mainly not on the speed of the interest rates 
decline.

We can list two other potential reasons for such move. One is related to a
probable Standard & Poors upgrade on Brazil in the coming months, which may
eventually be followed by Moody`s later. The second is a political influence 
to
boost government?s popularity and I will risk saying even to make Finance
Minister Pedro Malan?s candidacy to the Presidency in 2002 feasible. On that
evaluation see the analisys of a political think tank based in Brasilia: 
?That?s
the most important political movement of the year. On political terms it 
became
clear a favourable economic scenario, rebounding President Cardoso popularity
and the chances of political victory increasing a lot, all that not ment<oning
that the political noise in Brasilia will diminish".

Is it to late to change the Home Depot article. The issue with the county has
been resolved

Here is a revised version

"The developer of the Home Depot/ Target Center on FM2094 is proceeding on
plan.

The developers have requested that the Texas Department of Transportation
modify the new FM 2094 road to include three left turn lanes and a light at
Miller Road. The Water District has agreed to also include the new center in
their district as long as they pay any extra costs and meet certain other
conditions. The Developers have agreed to pay the extra cost for both
requests. The City passed a resolution to support both requests by the
developer and to express our intention to annex the property once the
developer closes on the property and makes an annexation request of the City.

The County and the Developers have also agreed to share in resurfacing part,
about 2100 feet, of Hanson Road- - a $200,000 cost. This is a significant
expense on top of all the other cost mentioned above.

But the project is proceeding as planned. The developers are still planning
on closing on the property in the next few weeks."

Just anything you want me to know about to represent you would be fine.  I 
feel comfortable with where you are going to be placed, and can represent you 
just fine with Kam's input.  How are things going?  How's the baby.  Hope all 
is going well.  Take care.

Ken:  currently we get outside E-mails from PIRA and Enerfax on a daily 
basis.  I do not believe we would be at a disadvantage if these were blocked 
the last week.  Thanks.

Bob:  The problem we were having is that if they could get in, it would lock 
them up for up to 5 minutes and then kick them out.  This would happen over 
and over again.  They said it was alright from 7:30 to 8:30 am, then became 
unusable about 8:30.  It has gotten to the point that on most days when they 
get cut off and they have to log back in they do not even consider this a 
problem.  We need to get back to exceptional service so they do not have to 
keep logging back in.  Thanks Bob.

Rob,

Attached please find the current draft of the Letter Agreement (32581.7), 
including Attachment 8 (32573.7) which sets forth various provisions to be 
included in the Purchase Agreement.  Article 20 regarding indemnification is 
included in Attachment 8.

As we discussed, West LB has some concerns regarding including language in 
Article 20 which GEII requested by which West LB would indemnify GEII for 
Enron's acts (in its capacity as Agent).  West LB has suggested they would be 
willing to undertake this obligation if they are reimbursed by Enron through 
the Acquisition and Development Agreement.  Today, for the first time, West 
LB indicated that they may require a cap on this liability for Agent's acts 
in the Purchase Agreement.

GEII has requested that West LB undertake this obligation and Enron has 
agreed to pursue it with West LB.  In light of this, the language which would 
establish West LB's indemnity obligation for the Agent's acts is not included 
in the current draft of Attachment 8.

Please let me know how you would like to proceed.  As I mentioned, we are 
trying to finalize the Letter Agreement with GEII very shortly.  I apologize 
for any confusion and look forward to working with you on this matter.  If 
you have any questions or would like to discuss this matter further, please 
feel free to contact me at 713-655-5102.

Thanks,
Vanessa.

Subject: Expression of Interest


Rob,

It has been some time now since I forwarded you my resume, and in that I
have not heard back from you, I suspect that your particular group had no
open positions.  I am genuinely interested in Enron, and feel that my
diverse background, experience and education could possibly benefit your
company in a number of capacities.  Therefore, I would greatly appreciate
your assistance in advising me as to whom I should direct my expression of
interest.  Should it go to Human Resources, Department Heads, or perhaps
specific individuals ?

I am attaching hereto, a current copy of my resume should that be helpful in
any way.  Thanking you in advance for your assistance.  Enjoy the weekend.

Bill
