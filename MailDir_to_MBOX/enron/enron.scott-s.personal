Bug had a busy Halloween at school- Big kids dressed up trick or treated at
all the classrooms and bug was the only baby still awake during this time so
they put her in a high chair to watch all of the action.  She fell asleep on
the short ride home which she never does. We bought her an outifit to wear
at Old Navy that's not really a "costume". It is an orange one piece thing
with these cute smiling spiders on it that says "silly spiders". It was a
little boyish, but the pumpkin motif suit was on white t-shirt material and
I knew it would be totally stained by the end of the day.  The orange hid
those pesky carrots and peaches! We took pictures of her holding on to the
gourd jack-o-lantern yesterday morning.  I think she enjoyed watching the
kids come to our door for candy, but she really didn't like the doorbell
much at all. The "Hamlets" slummed it and left their million dollar house
area of Alamo Heights to come trick or treat on the old street.  They
brought new baby whose name sounds like Frayton - not sure how to spell -
but it was fun to see them again. Well, we will hook up another weekend but
in the meantime I will send portraits and hopefully some other pics your
way.

Hi!  Sorry to hear about the stomach virus and I hope you are feeling much
better.
Just back from Cali.  It was a fun trip!
I'm in need of a Bug fix, especially after comparing niece/nephew notes
with (and bragging a lot to) Sue, Edd and Craig over the weekend.
Unfortunately, I have to stay in Houston this weekend for a wedding.  Was
contemplating visiting the weekend of Nov. 11 but you know that's totally
D.E.'s call.
If you mail photos, I'd suggest sending to me at my office, c/o Enron
Transportation Services, 1400 Smith St., Room 4788 (very important),
Houston 77002.  That way they will not get mangled or wet.
Did you dress the little one up for Halloween?
Have a good day!

OK! Since our last attempt to go to Austin was foiled by a bout of stomach
virus, we will go THIS weekend for much needed wig control! Might you be
available for a visit ? Just thought I'd clue you in since you haven't seen
bug for a while! I picked up her portraits today at lunch and they look
good! If we meet in Austin this weekend I will hand deliver, otherwise I'll
mail or FedEx.  What address would you prefer, home or office? Let me know!

The Star Diva has spoken!  I believe she is correct in everything but the

would come back.  And I would miss you while you were gone!  I cannot
imagine wanting to go on a trip without you, and I don't consider myself a

Since every Saj is equal parts idealist and gambler, your relationship
should be very interesting.
You're great pals, marvelous traveling companions, a pair of high-flying,
high-rolling
activist/adventurers. Just come down to earth once in awhile -- or find
someone else to
do it for you. This union requires periodic reality checks. You share each
others ideals, interests
and adventures like no one else can. Both of you like to read, study,
observe, learn and teach.
When you're doing all those things together, life may get exhausting but
never boring.
Travel is part of the glue that holds you together. So here's a warning:
Separate vacations
are a no-no. Each of you is such a wanderer, somebody might not come back
--
or remain at home.

I suggest putting the trap out with food as fast as humanly possible as this
cat has to go! A hungry cat is a motivated cat! If it does not work, we can
put food out sans trap and get his confidence,  then use the trap. I think
mouse will go for the canned food -the stinkier the better.

Assuming Mouse is caught - what then? SPCA and the likely result or do we
relocate him to, lets say, Pasadena?

I think if he develops a "taste" for something on our back porch it will
only make him hang around more...we should be as cruel as possible and just
stick something out there when we are ready to take him in...he seemed
pretty willing the last time (although he may be smarter now that he is
fatter and not seemingly as hungry)
Trapper Craig probably knows the best procedure though, so I will defer to
his suggestions...

SPCA has several "cat" (Mouse) traps available.
They're only open 'til 7 tonight and I have a DiverseWorks meeting at 6.
Not sure if I will make it over there today.  Could probably go at lunch
tomorrow.  Question:  when to set the trap?  Shall we at least appease him
with a little food on the back porch first, maybe something really stinky
and canned?  That will give him a chance to develop a taste for the salmon,
tuna, whatever we bait the trap with; plus it might get him to shut up.
Then we can set the trap when there is time to take him to the shelter.  I
figure it is probably best not to trap him during the wee hours; we have
probably not yet heard Mr. Mouse at his loudest.
Comments?  Any advice from Trapper Craig?

Robert just called and said he was bored.  Can I forward your e-mail to him 
for the obnoxious male perspective?
Pretty please?

If not, I would advise deciding what you want to do and dressing 
appropriately.  I know you don't want to hear this but unless you know he's 
going to show up in jeans (and he doesn't sound like the type), jeans are a 
no-no.  Haven't you read the Houston girl's corollary to the Rules:  No jeans 
during the first month unless you are attending (1) the Rodeo (in which case 
jeans should be pressed and pleated); (2) a honky tonk; (3) a Nascar event or 
(4) #s.

The not-so-great-and-even-less-powerful (in fact, i'm not sure why you bother 
to ask me for advice at all) Ann has spoken.

Go forth and date.  It'll be okay.

I suggested both the Dan Electro and the Going Out Downtown ideas to Craig,
and we got off on a tangent and never made a decision, except that he is
coming over at 7:30.  Now I'm faced with the dilemma of what to wear (only
a problem when I go out with Craig).

Should I:
a) call him at home later and ask him where we're going
b) wear something noncommittal that wouldn't be especially appropriate at
either venue
c) wear jeans and change into something nicer if we go downtown
d) wear a slipdress and change into jeans if we go to the Heights
hinterlands?

Pls. reply.
I hate dating.

Thanks Susan, am sending to Deron.  Would it be okay with  you if personal
commentary was added after the add itself is posted?  Some of these things
are best coming from another party.  Was thinking of commenting:

-The 2nd bedroom is small but makes a wonderful study/office/sunroom
-Location provides quick access to I-10 and I-45
-Living room is spacious with a nook that is currently used for bookshelves
but could be used as an extra closet.  One corner of living room has built
in shelves/cabinets.
-Garage apt. is over a 3 car garage, so it is larger than most garage
apartments
-Landlord lives in house and is extremely nice
-Garage apt. is very attractive and is located on a very nice street in The
Heights.  House and garage apartment are recently repainted and
well-maintained.
-References are available from current tenant

Let me know if these things are okay to post...

Thanks,

ashley

did against you last Monday I would have won!  I'm playing Ron Billings
tonight at 6 & maybe the good-serving Bill will show up.

Espero que el problema de seno (sinus) se haya mejorado y que te pase bien
el dia.

Un beso, G.

i am so sorry you are sick, i am just getting over being sick, i think i
nipped mine in the bud though because everyone around here got really bad
and i was over it and 4 days.  i stayed home the first day i felt bad and
o.d.ed on zinc and vitamin c.  that really works if you catch it on time.
stay home and get well.  i am trying to make plans w/betsy and was hoping
she could join us this weekend but she was busy.  we are going to try and
hang out and/or paint on nov. 4th.  if you are available maybe you could
come in that weekend?

Hi Misty!  When you e-mailed I was en route to Washington, D.C.  I just got
back.
I was planning to come this weekend, but I seem to have come down with a
sinus infection so I think I should stay in Houston and rest.  I'm pretty
bummed because I was looking forward to it.
Hope everything is going ok.  I'll give you a call later.

Hi Mum -- not going to DC until next week.
Any ideas for Karin's birthday?  Maybe we could look for something this 
weekend.
I plan to get out into the nice weather today as soon as I can!
Going to Brennan's tonight w/Craig.
Dianna isn't coming with me to Austin so I guess I will just come first thing 
Sat. a.m.  I'll give you a call tomorrow!
S.

Hi, Sooz!

Guess you didn't have to make your trip.

Had thought that seeing Carmen in Houston even though it's being presented
here in May would be interesting, but think I'll pass on it.  I return Oct 18
and don't know if Karin wants me to spend the weekend with her and the Bug or
not since Jim will be gone.  But, I might come the end of Oct to do some
shopping.  Eric will be coming sometime the first 2 wks of Nov to use his
free ticket by the 15th.  We're going to get his reservation made when he
picks me up at the San Jose airport.  I'll be coming at some point for Ann
Kelly's birthday which is in Nov.  It's always difficult to find a date with
everyone's busy schedule--especially Ann's.  She never stops.

Went to the outlet this morning and bought some shoes but couldn't find
anything else.  That's always a lost cause for me and it will be a long time
before I go again.

Gorgeous day here, but it's warming up again.  So pleasant sleeping with the
bedroom door open to the porch.

Looking forward to seeing you.  Love, mum

Susan,

I am plus/minus on the movie - just a thought.

You are glowing? I have the shakes  - being with you makes so happy. The
shear excitement I have when I get an e-mail from is embarrassing.

Susan,

I don't know if my dad told you, but I am at Tulane law school and enjoying
it very much.  The work is challeging, but I am really happy with the my
choice of paths.  The campus is beautiful, the people are normal, the town is
amazing (a bit distracting at times), and my professors and the law school in
general are fantastic.

I am writing you to ask for your advice.  They are beginning to apply the job
search pressure to us (it is already the 8th week) and I am trying to figure
out my best course of action.  I have heard that most of the big firms in
Houston aren't even looking for students after only their 1st year-- that
they prefer to interview after the 2nd year for summer clerk positions and
then associate jobs. Do you know of any smaller firms or specific attorneys
that I might be able to pursue with a letter and resume?

What did you do after your first year?  Did you stay in Texas?  I do know
that I want to practice in Houston, so I think that working there during
this, my first summer, would be a smart idea.  It will at least give me more
time to make contacts/ meet people.

What do you think?  Any thoughts/advice you have would be greatly appreciated.


Thank you,
Katy

Ten Cents A Dance
Ruth Etting
Words by Lorenz Hart and Music by Richard Rodgers (1930)

-charted at #5 (1930)


Ten cents a dance, that's what they pay me
Gosh, how they weigh me down
Ten cents a dance, pansies and rough guys
Tough guys who tear my gown

Seven to midnight I hear drums
Loudly the saxophone blows
Trumpets are tearing my eardrums
Customers crush my toes

Sometimes I think I've found my hero
But it's a queer romance
All that you need is a ticket
Come on, big boy, ten cents a dance!

It occurred to me that you might log on and get your e-mail...

Just wanted to tell you you're on my mind, and that makes me happy even
though I am at the office on a Sunday!   You make me smile even when you
are thousands of miles away.   I think you are absolutely fabulous, or as

For those who did not have time to watch the third and final presidential
debate Tuesday night, I've prepared this transcript of what was said:

Jim Lehrer:
Welcome to the third presidential debate between Vice President Al Gore and
Gov.  George W.  Bush. The candidates have agreed on these rules: I will ask
a question.  The candidate will ignore the question and deliver rehearsed
remarks designed to appeal to undecided women voters.  The opponent will
then have one minute to respond by trying to frighten senior citizens into
voting for him. When a speaker's time has expired, I will whimper softly
while he continues to spew incomprehensible statistics for three more
minutes.

Let's start with the vice president.  Mr.  Gore, can you give us the name of
a downtrodden citizen and then tell us his or her story in a way that
strains the bounds of common sense?

Gore:
As I was saying to Tipper last night after we tenderly made love the way we
have so often during the 30 years of our rock-solid marriage, the
downtrodden have a clear choice in this election.  My opponent wants to cut
taxes for the richest 1 percent of Americans.  I, on the other hand, want to
put the richest 1 percent in an ironclad lockbox so they can't
hurt old people like Roberta Frampinhamper, who is here tonight.  Mrs.
Frampinhamper has been selling her internal organs, one by one, to pay for
gas so that she can travel to these debates and personify problems for me.
Also, her poodle has arthritis.

Lehrer:
Gov.  Bush, your rebuttal.

Bush:
Governors are on the front lines every day, hugging people, crying with
them, relieving suffering anywhere a photo opportunity exists.  I want to
empower those crying people to make their own decisions, unlike my opponent,
whose mother is not Barbara Bush.

Lehrer:
Let's turn to foreign affairs.  Gov.  Bush, if Slobodan Milosevic were to
launch a bid to return to power in Yugoslavia, would you be able to
pronounce his name?

Bush:
The current administration had eight years to deal with that guy and
didn't get it done. If I'm elected, the first thing I would do about that
guy is have Dick Cheney confer with our allies.  And then Dick would present
me several options for dealing with that guy.  And then Dick would tell me
which one to choose.  You know, as governor of Texas, I have to make tough
foreign policy decisions every day about how we're going to deal with New
Mexico.

Lehrer:
Mr.  Gore, your rebuttal.

Gore:
Foreign policy is something I've always been keenly interested in. I
served my country in Vietnam.  I had an uncle who was a victim of poison gas
in World War I.  I myself lost a leg in the Franco-Prussian War.  And when
that war was over, I came home and tenderly made love to Tipper in a way
that any undecided woman
voter would find romantic.
If I'm entrusted with the office of president, I pledge to deal
knowledgeably with any threat, foreign or domestic, by putting it in an
ironclad lockbox.  Because the American people deserve a president who can
comfort them with simple metaphors.

Lehrer:
Vice President Gore, how would you reform the Social Security system?

Gore: It's a vital issue, Jim.  That's why Joe Lieberman and I have proposed
changing the laws of mathematics to allow us to give $50,000 to every senior
citizen without having it cost the federal treasury a single penny until the
year 2250.  In addition, my budget commits $60 trillion over the  next 10
years to guarantee that all senior citizens can have drugs delivered free to
their homes every Monday by a federal employee who will also help them with
the child-proof cap.

Lehrer:
Gov.  Bush?

Bush:
That's fuzzy math.  I know, because as governor of Texas, I have to do
math every day.  I have to add up the numbers and decide whether I'm going
to fill potholes out on Rt.  36 east of Abilene or commit funds to reroof
the sheep barn at the Texas state fairgrounds.

Lehrer:
It's time for closing statements.

Gore:
I'm my own man.  I may not be the most exciting politician, but I will
fight for the working families of America, in addition to turning the
White House into a lusty pit of marital love for Tipper and me.

Bush:
It's time to put aside the partisanship of the past by electing no one but
Republicans.

Lehrer:
Good night.

Shall I compare the week's profitability to a train wreck?  
Thy profitability art more generous and more temperate:
Scattered railcars do shake the darling mainline pipe,
And operations humor all too short this date.

So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,   
So long these earnings shall be accretive to thee.

Well, since you asked (And I know you did not but I can not resist - I
laughing very hard right now) I think about you and how sweet you are. I try
not to fixate as I believe it is unhealthily both psychologically and
physically as I can easily run for an hour.

Hi, Sooz

Just returned from the Workman Gallery to pay for the painting--which, by the
way, I really like.  It's so nice to know you like something immediately and
don't have to sneak up on it for another look to make up your mind!  Anyway,
I was asking Wally about her gallery--she's been in business for 20 yrs, and
I'm sure in that time there were some really bad times for her here in
Austin.  I was telling her about you, and she said the woman who owns Sloan
Jordan Gal. in the arboretum is an attorney here in town, and is sure she
must have a business manager to run the place.  (Gail or Gayle something.)
Anyway, she said we should call her and invite her to lunch so you could talk
with her.

K, J & G are coming in Sat. for Karin's haircut.  Always anxious to see
Grayson.

Hope our tickets to "Chorus Line" are good.  I'm really looking forward to
it.  The performance starts at 2:30--a decent hour for you to get here.  We
can go out for drinks and dinner afterward.

Glad your painting turned out well.  Looking forward to seeing what a
difference it makes.  Have a good weekend.    love, mum

Jewish Haiku It is common knowledge that poetry lovers have been frustrated 
by the fact that no poet has chosen to express Jewish themes and feelings in 
the haiku style (three unrhymed lines of five, seven, and five syllables 
respectively). Filling this gap in poetic literature, David M. Bader has 
recently written a book titled Haikus for Jews. Here are a few examples of 
his poetry:
Is one Nobel Prize
so much to ask from a child
after all I've done
-------------
Five thousand years a
wandering people - then we
found the cabanas.
-------------
In the ice sculpture
reflected bar-mitzvah guests

I left him an extremely short voice mail thanking him for the book and asking 
him not to contact me again unless his message is kind and positive.  I tried 
to make my tone very pleasant and calm.

On Ann's and your advice, I'm going to rescue the shredded letter/envelope 
out of the trash; be careful what you toss in there.

Hola Susana:

Que tal?  Llegue tarde anoche de una linda visita a lo de mi hermana en
Boston.  Sin embargo, recibi muy malas noticias en cuanto a mi prima Lori.
El viernes pasado se encontraron 2 tumors en el cerebro.  Su hermano, Tommy,
ya estaba en St. Martin y volvio ayer a Florida.  Lori llega hoy.  Manana
tiene cita con el oncologo.  Como el proposito del viaje fue juntarme con
ella, no tengo ganas de irme solo.

Bueno, te llamo esta semana y puede ser que te vea mas tarde en el Met como
juego con Herve a las 6.  un beso, G.

Will try to come up with some other ideas today.    love, mum

Susan,

I am afraid I have some bad news (well, happy in some ways but not so good
in others)... I have decided to move in with Deron and will not be renewing
my lease at the end of November.  I am really going to miss it, but the
reality is that I am rarely there, and the
I-need-to-start-saving-money-for-a-house side of me knows it is silly to
keep paying rent.

Oh, and I started a new job.. I work at Exult now
(ashley.streetman@exult.net).  We are a whopping 15 blocks away from Hewitt.

Some of my things are slowly trickling over to Deron's, but things should be
in good order to show.

Deron said he would be happy to post an ad for it/you at Hewitt in the Want
Ads database, if you would like (that is how I heard about it, from
Karen)... I have very nice things to say about the apartment and landlord,
so I would be very happy to reassure any prospective tenants that they would
be moving into an excellent place.

My new work phone is 281 539 6582.

:) ashley

Sugarbooger,

Looks like Continental is our best bet at $620 per ticket, which I'm assuming 
reflects the beginning of the official high season in C.R.  American is 
slightly lower but you have to go THRU MIAMI!  Ick!
There is a 9:30 a.m. out of Houston on 12/9 and the return trip from San Jose 
is at 8:10 a.m. (a 3 p.m. was also available).
They're holding the tickets for us; if we want them, we have to decide before 
COB tomorrow.

Muchos besos!

Hi!  Saw some clear glass votive holders on a long stem at Smith-Hawken the
other day that I thought might be different on the table for the holidays.
Don't know if they're in the catalog and don't know how much they are.

Am looking at some fireplace tools that Breed sells by the piece.  Interested
in tongs, poker, shovel.  But don't know if I want them on a stand or not,
and that gets pricey.  Also need a new bellows.

Breed also has a leather and metal log holder that's nice looking--but that
also may be pricey.

Always jewelry.

A red muffler to wear with my black jacket for the slopes--saw a man's at
Banana Republic.

More ideas later.     love, mum

>From astrology.com (must I beware of overindulgence in such websites?)
I like the part about charm and charisma and think it is very true.

Sagittarius and Sagittarius
When two Sagittarians join together in a love match, the truth-loving natures 
makes theirs a near perfect relationship. This couple views the world around 
them with an educated eye and both share an intense hunger for more 
knowledge. They will engage one another in pleasant conversation and 
banter that challenges and tickles the mind.  An occasional hotheaded dispute 
can erupt in the Sagittarius-Sagittarius relationship, when one fact-fanatic 
Sag 
partner carries things a little too far. Easygoing and independent, these two 
are 
compatible when it comes to balancing personal interests. They've never known 
jealousy, and each partner keeps busy with personal projects when not with 
their 
lover. When they are together, however, they do all they can toward pleasing 
their partner and satiating common interests.  Although they are adaptable 
and 
modern, they can, at times, fly off the handle. However, it is not in the 
Archer's 
nature to hold a grudge or let disagreements fester very long. 

Sagittarius is ruled by the Planet Jupiter (Luck). Expansion is the key word 
here; 
as both partners enjoy the acquisition of knowledge, they will carry over 
exciting 
ideas into their relationship. They must be mindful of over-indulgences, as 
such 
gluttony will only distract them. Their charm and charisma make them a very 
pleasant couple not only to one another, but the entire crowd.

Well, the last thing I need right now is anything involving strings, so in 
that
respect, maybe we should just all meet up for a happy hour and not call it
ANYTHING, like a date, or set-up, or whatever!  I'd like to meet this guy,
though, since you do know him.  Like you said, I'm NOT going to meet anyone 
in a
bar.  John doesn't have any kids, or x--wives does he?

I was kinda interested in the manager of Sambuca, Charles (Chuck) Dearborn, 
and
he seemed kinda interested in me, BUT then I found out he has an x-wife and 2
kids in another state.  NO THANKS!  Where is the line for baggage-free 
men???  I
know we all have it, but just for once, I'd like to meet a man who can DEAL 
WITH
HIS OWN...MATURELY!

You're right, though, I need to try to date a guy with a "normal" job.  I 
don't
know what's wrong today, but I miss Craig so much right now.

Later,
Ro

John is tall, dark & handsome (and as I told you yesterday, very fit).  He
looks very Italian.  I've known him most of the time I've been at Enron;
first met him when he was dating (i.e., going out on just a few dates with)
my friend Staci.  He is very fun and very sweet but just a tad bit flighty;
still think he has some growing up to do.  That's why I warned Dianna that
he would probably just be someone to go out on a few dates with, for fun.
I really don't think he's ready to settle down at all.  On the other hand,
he's fun to be with, and has a way of making you feel that you're the only
woman in the room.  That kind of attention (the lighthearted,
no-strings-attached kind) might be just what you need right now.  The
problem with Dianna was that she instantly fell in love with him, and of
course was very frustrated when he did not call every day or want to hang
out all the time.  She finally started acting a little cold towards him.
His take on the situation:  she expects too much!
The only difficulty might be that John could be leery of dating my friends
by now!  But I can test the waters and let you know...

You're like me - my back has been bothering me, too lately, especially
after a
match and all that serving - I just have no desire right now to play that
tournament.  The cold doesn't help the stiffness, either.  I'm already
playing
HTA league, and I'm just still not interested in hanging out at the Met
much.  I
don't think I'm going to play Kingwood, either.  I'll make a decision by
tomorrow - I just really want to get out of town.

I want you to tell me more about this friend of yours.  What happened with
Diana?  What does he look like?  What does he do?  How long have you known
him -
TELL ME THE SCOOP!  After Craig, who is still the most gorgeous man I have
ever
been out with, it's just so difficult to see myself with anyone right now.
I
know I need to move on, and he'll come back when he's ready, IF I am
available.

Tell me - and if we do go out, we HAVE to double - I need to meet Craig
anyway......

Later,

I think I'm going to have to quit tennis.  My back hurts every time I play
a match.  It even hurts from yesterday's drill.  I think it is best if I
drop out of all the organized tennis I've signed up for this month.  Danny
is going to hate me.  Maybe he would let you sub in for me for the 4.5
singles tournament, since no one has played any matches yet (assuming you
want to play).  Ugh.  I really hate to not play tennis but I have to make
this back last for 35+ more years!  So it's just not worth it.

Good to see you looking so happy yesterday!  we need to find you a man in
Houston.  If/when you want me to set you up with my friend, let me know!

S.

Getting an e-mail from you definitely gives me a big smile on my face!

Lunch was wonderful - I did not want to go back to work. I would have loved
to spend the day with you.

Now regarding being your office boy, I did not say anything about group as I
can not be distracted from your needs, I can't think of a better job unless
you owned an art gallery and I was the mover de arte'

You did not ask me what I thought of when I ran.

list as well?

I decided to wait until Thanksgiving to give you G's portrait - is that okay
with you? I CAN send it sooner if you prefer. Her school pics are in now
too.

Sorry I didn't call back last night. We were toy shopping with Grandma Sally
and then it was time for dinner, etc., etc. and got a call from Mema where
she immediately launched into all of her health problems.  Was Dreamy Eric

Since every Saj is equal parts idealist and gambler, your relationship
should be very interesting.
You're great pals, marvelous traveling companions, a pair of high-flying,
high-rolling
activist/adventurers. Just come down to earth once in awhile -- or find
someone else to
do it for you. This union requires periodic reality checks. You share each
others ideals, interests
and adventures like no one else can. Both of you like to read, study,
observe, learn and teach.
When you're doing all those things together, life may get exhausting but
never boring.
Travel is part of the glue that holds you together. So here's a warning:
Separate vacations
are a no-no. Each of you is such a wanderer, somebody might not come back --
or remain at home.

I went home for a late lunch and waiting in the mail was a novel (I forget

awful person, all in a very superior tone.

Haven't taken the trash out yet -- do you think I should keep the shredded

Hi Susan! 

Speaking french! Tres bien!? Actually, we just got back from France 
yesterday.. had a good time. I? hope you had? wonderful holiday.

I will call and check.. I am not sure.? I believe I may have to cancel to get 
my deposits back for the gas and electric... I am disputing something on my 
phone bill which should be cleared up by the next bill but in case it is? 
not, it might be confusing.

If transferring works well, I would be happy to do so.? You are welcome to 
give him my email address and maybe we can work something out.

Thanks for cleaning... it is fairly clean (minus the floor in the bedroom and 
the small study... stopped sweeping because it got really dark).? 

I just need to empty out the refrigerator (only a few items are in there... 
one or two which I would like to keep) and remove the curtains (from the 
bedroom).? I think I am going to keep the rod in, if that is okay, as to not 
tear up the walls or cause a need for repainting.

I will send you the address shortly... Let me know if there is anything else 
that would help!

Hi Ashley!? A couple of things.? First of all, my new renter, Doug, wonders 
whether he can just call the utilities & phone and transfer from his name 
to yours (rather than you cancelling and him having to pay any re-hookup 
fees that may apply).?? I don't know how it would work; maybe he could 
conference you in when he makes the calls.? For what it is worth, he is a 
very nice guy to deal with, but it is totally up to you and I really don't 
care one way or the other. 

Also, I'm having someone come clean the place so you needn't worry about 
it, in case you were wondering.? I will take care of it (it looks pretty 
clean anyway!). 

Please let me know your new address and I will send you your deposit refund 
next week. 

Merci! 

Susan

Sooz,

I called SW Bell and changed the number.  Apparently, I can't have that
number in my new place, but in order for a changed number message to run,
you can't have it either. So the new number on your second line is (713)
426-5773 and it will start on the 5th. Until then, my number will ring in
both places.  My new number is (713) 526-7855...

Hope this is okay with you.  I left the new second number tied in with the
4960 number with the same long distance service you have on that line etc.

Hope you are having a good morning!

Hi, Sooz!

Guess you didn't have to make your trip.

Had thought that seeing Carmen in Houston even though it's being presented
here in May would be interesting, but think I'll pass on it.  I return Oct 18
and don't know if Karin wants me to spend the weekend with her and the Bug or
not since Jim will be gone.  But, I might come the end of Oct to do some
shopping.  Eric will be coming sometime the first 2 wks of Nov to use his
free ticket by the 15th.  We're going to get his reservation made when he
picks me up at the San Jose airport.  I'll be coming at some point for Ann
Kelly's birthday which is in Nov.  It's always difficult to find a date with
everyone's busy schedule--especially Ann's.  She never stops.

Went to the outlet this morning and bought some shoes but couldn't find
anything else.  That's always a lost cause for me and it will be a long time
before I go again.

Gorgeous day here, but it's warming up again.  So pleasant sleeping with the
bedroom door open to the porch.

Looking forward to seeing you.  Love, mum

We can give you ideas for bug at Thanksgiving. The 2 specific toys that i
wanted for her have been purchased by aqua grandma, but she needs some more.
Her old toys are becoming too babyish for her.  I haven't had the time to
scout out the toy departments yet.  One thing that would be good is if
someone could see if that Sesame Street album exists - the one that I had.
I am progressing somewhat on her list, but items are very non-specific.
We will probably arrive in Austin on Thursday morning and stay 2 nights. I
heard that Mems is arriving on Wed. Is she actually going to drive?

Karin

No -- she keeps promising to, but I do not have any yet.  We should sit her
down after Thanksgiving dinner and help her make a list of what she needs.
I only need to shop for her and Grayson; I have everyone else covered!  I
have been a shoppin' fool!
What are your travel plans?

...that her husband can be so devious.

Here's hoping that you can join me in surprising Kim Watson for the 11th
anniversary of her 29th birthday.  Her birthday is actually on December
17th, but a key part of the deception is surprising her early.

We hope to see you on Friday, December 8, at The Spires, 2001 Holcombe
Blvd., Unit 2406 (77030).  If you need directions, you can call the front
desk at (713) 799-2501.  Desserts, wine, coffee and soft drinks will be
served.

The most current plan calls for folks to gather at our home between 7:30 and
8:00 p.m. on December 8.  Kim and I will be returning from our co-birthday
dinner (both of us are December kiddos), no earlier than 8:00 p.m. and will
proceed to unit 2406.  We'll come in and...(you know the rest...).

I need to have a rough head count of those who can make it, so please reply
to this e-mail by December 6 with your RSVP, or you can leave me a voice
mail at (281) 440-5300 x222.  Both are secure from Kim, so don't worry about
using either of these methods.  If you've already told me you can't make it,
you don't need to reply again.

Remember, no gifts, please.  Your presence will be gift enough.

Hope to see you on the 8th!

John Watson

Since every Saj is equal parts idealist and gambler, your relationship should 
be very interesting. 
You're great pals, marvelous traveling companions, a pair of high-flying, 
high-rolling 
activist/adventurers. Just come down to earth once in awhile -- or find 
someone else to 
do it for you. This union requires periodic reality checks. You share each 
others ideals, interests 
and adventures like no one else can. Both of you like to read, study, 
observe, learn and teach. 
When you're doing all those things together, life may get exhausting but 
never boring. 
Travel is part of the glue that holds you together. So here's a warning: 
Separate vacations 
are a no-no. Each of you is such a wanderer, somebody might not come back -- 
or remain at home.
