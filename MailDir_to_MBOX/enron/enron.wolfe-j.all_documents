Foreigner's Travel Guide to Texas

>
> Like it or not, the new Texas White House will be in Crawford, Texas and
> soon will  be drawing a number of people to the state, including many who
> are not used to Texas ways. They might find the following advice useful.
>
>
> 1) Don't expect to find filet mignon or pasta primavera at the local
> restaurant. It's a cafe. They serve hamburgers and chicken fried steak.
Let
> them cook something they know.  If you confuse them, they'll kick your
ass.
>
>
> 2) Don't laugh at the names (Merleen, Bodie, Bubba, Bobby Ray, Curley,
Tammy
> Lynn, Billy Joe, Sissy, Clovis, etc.).  Or we will HAVE to kick your ass.
>
>
> 3) Don't order a bottle of pop or a can of soda. In Texas it's called a
> coke. Nobody gives a damn whether it's Pepsi, RC, Dr. Pepper, 7-Up or
> whatever - it's still a coke. Accept it.  Doing otherwise can lead to an
ass
> kicking.
>
>
> 4) We know our heritage. Most of us are more literate than you (read some
J.
> Frank Dobie). We are also better educated and generally a lot nicer than
> you.  Don't refer to us as a bunch of cowboy hicks, or we'll kick your
ass.
>
>
> 5) We have plenty of business sense (e.g., Howard Hughes, H. Ross Perot,
> Southwest Airlines, Dell computers). Naturally, sometimes we have small
> lapses in judgment (e.g., Phil Gramm).  However, we are not dumb enough to
> let someone move to our state just so they can run for the US Senate.  If
> anyone tried to do that they would  get a serious ass kickin'.
>
>
> 6a) Don't laugh at our Civil War monuments. If Lee had listened to Gen.
Hood
> you'd be paying taxes to Richmond instead of Washington.
>
>
> 6b) IF you visit the Alamo, take your hat off and be properly humble, or
> we'll kick your ass.
>
>
> 7) We are fully aware of how hot it gets and high the humidity is, so shut
> up about it.  If you can't stand the heat get out of the kitchen, or we'll
> kick your ass.
>
>
> 8a) Do not attempt to eat tamales without first removing their corn husk
> casing. Everyone will instantly know that you're a Yankee.
>
>
> 8b) DO NOT, under any circumstances, complain that the chili is TOO hot or
> contains no kidney beans, this will get your ass kicked into next week.
>
>
> 9) Don't talk about how much better things are at home because we know
they
> are not. Many of us have visited Northern hell-holes like Detroit,
Chicago,
> and DC, and we have the scars to prove it.  If you don't like it here,
Delta
> is ready when you are. Move your ass on home - before we kick it.
>
>
> 10) Yes, we know how to speak proper English. We talk this way because we
> don't want to sound like you. We don't care if you don't understand what
we
> are saying. All other Texans understand what we are saying and that's all
> that matters. Now, go away, or we'll kick your ass.
>
>
> 11) Don't complain that certain areas of  this state  "smell" of  oil.  If
> your livelihood depended on those wells you'd soon learn to love the
aroma.
> Besides, None of OUR lakes or rivers have caught fire recently.  If you
> whine about OUR scenic beauty, we'll kick your ass all the way back to
> Pittsburgh, PA.
>
>
> 12) Don't ridicule our Texas manners. We say sir and ma'am. We hold doors
> open for others. We offer our seats to old folks. Such things are expected
> of civilized people. Behave yourselves around our sweet little gray-haired
> grandmothers, or they'll kick your ass -- just like they did ours.
>
>
> 13) Don't think we're quaint or losers because most of us live in small
> towns.  We do this because we have enough sense to not live in crime
> infested cesspools like Baltimore. Make fun of our small towns and we'll
> kick your ass.
>
>
> 14)  DO NOT DARE to tell us how to cook barbecue. This will get your ass
> shot (right after it is kicked). Criticize the barbecue and you may go
home
> in a pine box -- minus your ass.
>
>
> 15) Remember, the only reason you are lucky enough to be here in the first

Subject: Gas Performance Testing TODAY - April 5, 2001
Importance: High

The Unify Migration Team would like to thank you for your participation in 
the gas performance test on Wednesday 4/4.  Based on our observations, system 
monitoring, and your feedback we have identified several areas for 
performance improvement.  We have attempted to fix some of these issues and 
need everyone's help again on Thursday 4/5 from Noon until 2:00, to test the 
modifications and identify other areas for improvement.

The purpose of this test is to continue to measure Unify's performance on the 
new platform and find new areas for potential improvement before the 
application is delivered into production.  Identifying performance issues at 
this early stage is extremely important to all of us and beneficial to the 
successful completion of our migration efforts.

Thursday 4/5 Testing Agenda (Same as Wednesday 4/4)

Retest Day 1 Items - Use April 3rd & 4th Gas Day in the Unify2K PT Gas 
database.  Your floor contacts and phone numbers will be the same as Day 1.
  
DO NOT PERFORM TESTS FOR DAY 2 - These activities will be addressed in the 
next round of performance testing beginning 4/18.

Attached are the documents that were distributed in Tuesday's meeting.



Thank you again for all of your help and support.

Chris Gaskill asked me to forward all of you basic gas reports.  

For those of you who have a natural gas background, most of the information 
may be basic.  For those of you who are unfamiliar, the below reading 
material should afford a good overview of where the  gas market has been, 
where it is headed and what the fundamental of the natural gas market are.  
If you have any questions, you can contact Chris Gaskill.  If you'd like more 
reading material, you can also let me know :)  If you have any questions 
regarding the group, feel free to contact me.  I will be in NY for the next 
two weeks but I can be reached via email or cell (713)628-8395.

Hi folks.  I'm not as witty as Clay, and I know even less French, so I'll
get straight to the point.  Bachelor party plans are well underway, but a)
we need an idea of how many people we're working with, and b) we need your
suggestions on the best way to celebrate Eric's last few days of being his
own man.  (Okay, those were back in 1996 or so, but it's a symbolism thing.)

To facilitate this, Kiernan has erected (hee hee) a website dedicated to the
May 12 party.  Go to www.burrosale.com, and click on the picture most
representative of the dates Eric went on before Tara.  If you choose
correctly, you will be able to read updates and post on a message board.
The message board is to be used to discuss the party and embarrass Eric in
any way you find appropriate.

If you haven't already please RSVP by e-mail to me, or call at 512.297.8085
or for a local call, Clay at 713.662.3789.  In order to defray costs, there
will be a "suggested donation" of $25.  Spots in the limo will be assigned
on a first-come first-serve basis to those that pay.  I hate to do that, but
the poor starving law student best man isn't eating only Wolf Chili and
Ramen noodles because he likes that pork flavor.

Anyhow, check the site frequently for updates, enjoy the board, and spread
the word to those I don't know that would be interested.

Subject: Counterparties w/ Master Agreements with ECC

I have received an updated list of the counterparties that have Master 
Agreements with ECC.  There are now about 40 counterparties that fall under 
this category.  What seems to be happening is that these counterparties are 
hitting on US gas products on EOL and are not bridging into Tagg correctly.  
Currently, they are bridging as one leg between ENA and the counterparty.  
The problem arises during settlement because ENA cannot settle with these 
counterparties, only ECC can.  An example of what Risk is doing to the 
products after bridging is Tagg#Q79131 / EOL #555401.

RISK:  We need risk to verify that anytime, without exception, all companies 
with Master Agreements with ECC that hit a US product must be booked as two 
legs:  leg one booked between ECC and the counterparty with risk assignment 
of FT-US/CAND-ERMS; leg two flipping the risk out of FT-US/CAND-ERMS to the 
appropriate risk book.  Also, risk needs to verify that this is only for 
Financial Swaps and not Physical deals.  

IT:  It is my understanding that a few counterparties are set up to be booked 
correctly (with two legs).  The list is now up to 40 counterparties and will 
most likely be updated on a consistent basis.  Is this something that Tagg 
Maintenance can handle?  Guidelines need to be set up for Risk/Global to 
instruct IT when new Master Agreements are created with counterparties so 
logic can be adjusted accordingly.

Does a meeting need to be set up to elaborate on these issues?  Are there any 
further issues that need to be addressed concerning ECC Master Agreements?    
(i.e. What about when a counterparty with ECC Master Agreement hits a 
Canadian product out of the Houston office?)  
Please respond with your thoughts on this subject.

Thank you,
Dawn

Carole,

On the Rockies trade from Oct 04, Tudor only got TPT confirms.  They need OSP 
and BVI confirms as well.  Come by when you get a chance or I'll try and stop 
by.

Thanks, Vikas

Jason-

What is up?  My datebook says it is your birthday (I always write
yours and Tara's in at the same time 3/8 and 3/18...they are easy
to remember that way...random.)  Anyway, I have not had a chance
to shop, so I was thinking of making you some kleenex box shoes.
Sounds good right?

Stop by Matt's for a beer sometime...I have not seen you since
we played TP...I won right, jk.

Later,
Tami

Hi Jason,
Hope your work is going fine.  Mom and I are fine.
I hope you have your car & drivers license stuff fixed.
I was thinking (worrying) about that the other day, and it
dawned on me that if you got stopped again, they would probably
(may) take your drivers license. That wouldn't be too good with
you just starting a new job. Let me and mom know, we still worry
about you (and will till we're gone--so don't get in an uproar).
You will understand that when you have kids--natural instinct.
Mom and I are anxious to come see you in March, probably around
3d or 4th. We don't know if you can get a day off, or if you want
to even ask with your new job etc. But think about it and let us
know so we can plan our week off. If we can't see you more than the
weekend, we will leave Monday and do something ourselves on the way
back home. It's only a month away, so let us know what you'd like
or can do as soon as you can.  Thanks.  Say hi to Beth for us.
Dad
PS: Mom bought me the "Riding with the King" CD, so don't send it.

Jason,

Can you please rebook Q80051 due to us having an Executed Master Agreement 
with a different entity name and under ECC rather than ENA.

Please change buyer to AEC-OIL&GAS and seller to ECC.

Thanks,
Joe

Put a coversheet on it or something that has my name on it.
Thanks Dad

PS Think hard about anything you want us to bring since we will have the

1.? I can see your point, but I still think you're full of shit. 
2.? I don't know what your problem is, but I'll bet it's hard to pronounce. 
3.? How about never?? Is never good for you? 
4.? I see you've set aside this special time to humiliate yourself in public. 
5.? I'm really easy to get along with once you people learn to see it my way. 
6.? I'll try being nicer if you'll try being smarter. 
7.? I'm out of my mind, but feel free to leave a message. 
8.? I don't work here - I'm a consultant. 
9.? It sounds like English, but I can't understand a word you're saying. 
10.? Ahhh...I see the screw-up fairy has visited us again. 
11.? I like you.? You remind me of when I was young and stupid. 
12.? You are validating my inherent mistrust of strangers. 
13.? I have plenty of talent and vision.? I just don't give a damn. 
14.? I'm already visualizing the duct tape over your mouth. 
15.? I will always cherish the initial misconceptions that I had about ?you. 
16.? Thank you.? We're all refreshed and challenged by your unique point of  
view. 
17.? The fact that no one understands you doesn't mean you're an antist. 
18.? Any connection between your reality and mine is purely coincidental. 
19.? What am I?? Flypaper for freaks?! 
20.? I'm not being rude.? You're just insignificant. 
21.? It's a thankless job, but I've got alot of Karma to burn off. 
22.? Yes, I am an agent of Satan, but my duties are largely ceremonial. 
23.? And your crybaby, whiny butt opinion would be ...? 
24.? Do I look like a people person. 
25.? This is not an office, it's Hell with fluorescent lighting. 
26.? I started out with nothing and still have most of it left. 
27.? Sarcasm is just one more service we offer. 
28.? If I throw a stick, will you leave? 
29.? Errors have been made.? Others will be blamed. 
30.? Whatever kind of look you were going for, you missed. 
31.? I'm trying to imagine you with a personality. 
32.? A cubicle is just a padded cell without a door. 
33.? Can I trade this job for what's behind door #1? 
34.? Too many freaks, not enough circuses. 
35.? Nice perfume.? Must you marinate in it? 
36.? Chaos, panic, and disorder -- my work here is done. 
37.? How do I set a laser printer to stun? 
38.? I thought I wanted a career, turns out I just wanted paycheques.

Don't worry. It sounds like Chastant is going, at least.
I would consider going, except I don't work in engineering, and I don't
like Chastant.

You can convince me if you are definitely going and I can show up around 7.

Hi, I got your paypal payment but it was a little short. s/h is 14.55 plus  
76.00 +2.00 for ins. = 93.55. Take 84.00 from that and thats leaves 9.55. ? 
The clubs packed weigh 15lbs. 
Thanks Darrell

There is a file that may be useful to you guys.  It will show you all first 
of month curves, what gas daily curve they are mapped to and the volatility 
curve mapping.  

If you ever have a question about your gas daily swaps and what curves to use 
take a look at this.

Josh,
I guess you've been too busy to lace up your basketball shoes and get out
of the office.
It hasn't been too hot out, and I am ready to get back out on the court and
work
on my all-around Webber-esque game.
Also, you should try to get downtown for lunch sometime if you're not too
busy.
Later,

Jason

Attached is the updated scores.  Please check your scores to verify 
accuracy.  As the scores stand now, Joey will win no matter what and the 
second place race is between Chuck and Wolfe.  If Arizona loses, Wolfe takes 
second and if Arizona wins, it goes to the tiebreaker.  The rest of us are 
out of it.  If you have 0 all the way out, it means you do not have any teams 
remaining.  By the way - nice score Lenhart(we will see if we can get you a 
charitable deduction for your $10).

I would like to announce the following management changes within the Analyst 
/ Associate Program, which are effective immediately.

Traci Warner will assume responsibility for Recruiting for the Western 
Hemisphere.  Traci joined Enron's Associate Program in 1995 and has held 
positions in Business Development, Origination, and Public Relations at Enron 
Energy Services, Enron North America and Enron Broadband Services.

Ted Bland will assume responsibility for Career Development (including 
rotations) for the Western Hemisphere.  Ted has been with Enron since 1989 
and has held several roles in Origination and Business Development within 
Enron Wholesale Services.  Most recently, Ted was assigned to the 
commercialization of some activities within Human Resources.

Anna Jansson, who is based in London, will continue to lead all efforts for 
the Associate / Analyst Program in the Eastern Hemisphere.  Anna has been 
with Enron Europe for the past three years and, most recently, has been 
responsible for setting up the EBS Human Resources function in Europe.

Please join me in working with Traci, Ted and Anna to ensure the success of 
this important program.

Billy Lemmons
Vice President, Analyst / Associate Program

It's time again for the annual party that I host with John and a few good 
friends.  Some of you have attended in the past.....it is best described as a 
college keg party...no frills...just cold beer, loud music, darts and lots of 
people.  It has included everything from salsa dancing, moon pies,  to 
individuals driving their vehicle through the yard to get out of their 
parking spot.  The police have never been called to quiet things down, but 
don't let that discourage you from coming.  If you can't attend...like I 
always say...there will be another next year.  Please forward this on to 
anyone you think would be interested....this party is by all means not an 
invitation only gig.  Here are the details:

Saturday, January 27th, 7th Annual IDHAFR Party 
6422 Wister Ln.  77008 (About 5 min from Memorial park, just across I10)

bottom of the spread sheet. Feel free to email me with any questions.

Ad Dei Gloriam,
Michael
The Commissioner . . . you can trust!

LOL.............how in the world did you find that.


Here's some funny Santa letters

Dear Santa,
I wud like a kool toy space ranjur fer xmas. Iv ben a gud boy all
yeer.
Yer Frend,
BiLLy

Dear Billy,
Nice spelling.  You're on your way to a career in lawn care.  How
about I send you a fucking book so you can learn to read and write?  I'm
giving your older brother the space ranger.  At least HE can spell!
Santa

Dear Santa,
I have been a good girl all year, and the only thing I ask for is
peace and joy in the world for everybody!
Love,
Sarah

Dear Sarah,
You're parents smoked pot when they had you, didn't they?
Santa

Dear Santa,
I don't know if you can do this, but for Christmas, I'd like for my
mommy and daddy to get back together.  Please see what
you can do.
Love,
Teddy

Dear Teddy,
Look, your dad's banging the babysitter like a screen door in a
hurricane. you think he's gonna give that up to come back
to your frigid mom, who rides his ass constantly?  It's time to give up that
dream.  Let me get you some nice Legos instead.
Santa

Dear Santa,
I want a new bike, a Playstation, a train, some G.I. Joes, a dog, a
drum kit, a pony and a tuba.
Love
Francis

Dear Francis,
Who names their kid "Francis" nowadays?  I bet you're gay.
Santa

Dear Santa,
I left milk and cookies for you under the tree, and I left carrots for
your reindeer outside the back door.
Love,
Susan

Dear Susan,
Milk gives me the runs and carrots make the deer fart in my face when
riding in the sleigh.  You want to do me a favor? Leave me a bottle of
scotch.
Santa

Dear Santa,
What do you do the other 364 days of the year?  Are you busy making
toys?
Your friend,
Thomas

Dear Thomas,
All the toys are made in China.  I have a condo in Vegas, where I
spend most of my time making low-budget porno films.  I unwind by drinking
myself silly and squeezing the asses of cocktail waitresses
while losing money at the craps table.  Hey, you wanted to know.
Santa

Dear Santa,
Do you see us when we're sleeping, do you really know when we're
awake, like in the song?
Love,
Jessica

Dear Jessica,
Are you really that gullible?  Good luck in whatever you do.  I'm skipping
your house.
Santa

Dear Santa,
I really really want a puppy this year. Please please please PLEASE
PLEASE could I have one?
Timmy

Dear Timmy,
That whiney begging shit may work with your folks, but that crap
doesn't work with me.  You're getting a sweater again.
Santa

Dearest Santa,
We don't have a chimney in our house, how do you get into our home?
Love
Marky

Mark,
First, stop calling yourself "Marky", that's why you're getting your ass
kicked at school.  Second, you don't live in a house, you live in a
low-rent apartment complex.  Third, I get inside your pad just like all the
burglars do, through your bedroom window.
Sweet dreams,
Santa

Enron is forming a new organization - - the Enron Xcelerator - - to drive the 
formation and development of new businesses at Enron.  Enron's unique ability 
to start and develop new businesses has driven most of our growth over the 
years.  Lou L. Pai, currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Energy Services, will 
lead the Xcelerator.  Over his years at Enron, Lou has been key to the 
creation and rapid growth of our wholesale gas, wholesale power and energy 
service businesses.  The existing business units will continue their 
development of core businesses, while the Xcelerator will be responsible for 
developing new business opportunities that are natural extensions of Enron's 
business model and core skills, but not currently under development elsewhere 
in Enron.

Dave Delainey, currently President and CEO of Enron Americas, will become 
Chairman and CEO of Enron Energy Services.  Dave brings a wealth of 
experience and accomplishment from Enron Wholesale Services' businesses where 
he led the growth of our Canadian business and our North American origination 
activity and, most recently, had a great year in Enron Americas.

Dave is forming an Office of the Chairman in EES.  Joining Dave in the Office 
of the Chairman are Dan Leff, President of EES, Global Energy Services, and 
Marty Sunde, President of EES, Global Marketing and Services.  Dan and Marty 
have been instrumental in the development and execution of the successful EES 
business model.  Also joining the Office of the Chairman of EES is Janet 
Dietrich as Chief Operating Officer.  Janet, currently is Managing Director 
in Enron Americas, where she has been successful in many of Enron Wholesale's 
core businesses, including gas trading, risk management and structural 
origination.  Tom White will continue as Vice Chairman of EES and will focus 
on the development and expansion of EES' customer relationships.  Lou, Tom, 
Dan, Marty and the entire EES organization have developed a great business 
model with great growth prospects.  EES has become an essential part of 
Enron's market valuation and growth story.  This new leadership structure 
will enable EES to continue on its path of sustained growth and increasing 
profitability.

John Lavorato will succeed Dave as President and CEO of Enron Americas.  John 
has been an essential part of Enron's energy trading success over the years 
and is a key part of Enron Wholesale Services' continuing success story.  
Joining John is Louise Kitchen, currently President and CEO of Enron 
NetWorks.  Louise, who accelerated Enron's outstanding growth with the 
deployment of EnronOnline, will take over as Chief Operating Officer of Enron 
Americas.

Philippe Bibi, currently Chief Operating Officer of Enron NetWorks will take 
over as President and CEO of Enron NetWorks.  Under Philippe's leadership, 
Enron has become a technology leader and the leading e-commerce company.  
Joining Philippe as Chief Operating Officer is Greg Piper, currently Managing 
Director of Enron NetWorks.  Greg currently leads Enron NetWork's origination 
activity and was responsible for the creation and deployment of ClickPaper, 
Enron's successful online pulp and paper marketplace.

Please join us in congratulating all of these individuals on their 
achievements and their new responsibilities.

Mr. Wolfe,

People also called Castro a socially conservative nut amid other
things and yet he has successfully retained power in his country for 40
years.  I think Buchanan is capable of similar achievement, don't you?

Hey beotch,

The ski thing is on.  We are going to Lake Tahoe.  Arriving on Wed,
March 14th and leaving Sunday March 18th.  The closest airport is in Reno,
but some of the people are flying into Sacremento cuz it is cheaper.  We
have a house rented out and it sleeps 12.  I think it is going to be all
women with at the most 4 guys including you and me.  The women are mostly
single, wealthy, and looking for a noncommital, spring break type
relationship.  I think Nancy and I will be renting a car to drive to this
place from the airport.  Let me know if you want to hitch a ride with us.

Mr. Wolfeman,

I just want to make sure that you have prepared diligintly for the
storm that lies ahead for you this week.  Have you readied you psyche for
what is sure to be trying times for you and your personality disorders?
Have you stepped up physically to meet the demands that will be placed on
your less than adequate physical being?  Have you sought to stabilize your
all to unstable intellect as it will no doubt find itself constantly
belittled by far superior individuals? Jason, I ask you these things not to
intimidate you, but to warn you that most likely you will be the loser of
the group and to make sure that the others attending will not be
dissappointed with your 'loserness' so to speak.  I, however, am confident
that you will live up to all the you can be, nay, to all that you are.  I,
Mr. Wolfe, am placing such a responsibilty on you, because I know that you
have waited your whole life for just such a moment, and I am both happy and
proud to present you with just such an opportunity.  May this be the
beginning of many great things.

Lane

PS  If you need anything else, you might want to contact some of the other
people going as we are moving floors and I will not have my computer or
phone for the next couple of days.

This makes you want to out and have a coke. Right?



Just when you thought you knew everything....

1. In many states the highway patrol cars carry two gallons of Coke in the
trunk to remove blood from the highway after a car accident.
2. You can put a T-bone steak in a bowl of coke and it will be gone in two
days.
3. To clean a toilet: Pour a can of Coca-Cola into the toilet bowl, let the
"real thing" sit for one hour, then flush clean.
4. The citric acid in Coke removes stains from vitreous China.
5. To remove rust spots from chrome car bumpers: Rub the bumper with a
crumpled-up piece of Reynolds Wrap aluminum foil dipped in Coca-Cola.
6. To clean corrosion from car battery terminals: Pour a can of Coca-Cola
over the terminals to bubble away the corrosion.
7. To loosen a rusted bolt: Applying a cloth soaked in Coca-Cola to the
rusted bolt for several minutes.
8. To bake a moist ham: Empty a can of Coca-Cola into the baking pan, wrap
the ham in aluminum foil, and bake. Thirty minutes before the ham is
finished, remove the foil, allowing the drippings to mix with the Coke for
a sumptuous brown gravy.
9. To remove grease from clothes: Empty a can of coke into a load of greasy
clothes, add detergent, And run through a regular cycle. The Coca-Cola will
help loosen grease stains. It will also clean road haze from your
windshield.

FYI:
1.The active ingredient in Coke is phosphoric acid. It's pH is 2.8.  It
will dissolve a nail in about 4 days.
2. To carry Coca Cola syrup (the concentrate) the commercial truck must
use the Hazardous material place cards reserved for Highly Corrosive
materials.
3. The distributors of coke have been using it to clean the engines of
their trucks for about 20 years!

Drink up!

  Jason,

   I am having trouble doing your expense report.  SAP is telling me to have 
a tech fix
   the problem but it is a big process and I am switching over to Windows 
2000 tomorrow
   so I hate to go through all of that when everything will be different 
tomorrow.  Do me a
   favor, go in to XMS and change my name to Alex Saldana.  That way she can 
do your
   report for me.  Try to do it today before we change systems.  Let me know 
when it is
   done.  Sorry for the inconvienience.

Hi Jay,
I thought I'd send you some lite reading.  May provide a distraction for you
from your normal day.  This is a first hand account I received from Capt
Greider. He didn't (couldn't?) go into detail in some areas I would be
interested in, but at least it is the true story and account.  Suprisingly
not a whole lot different than the media reported.  The ROC vs PROC point
was interesting.  Shows the thought process of an insecure government.
Anyway enjoy.
Dad

AN INSIDE LOOK AT THE CHINA RESCUE MISSION
April 12, 2001
By Captain Guy Greider
Continental Airlines
Since the mid-air collision on April 1, 2001 between a U.S.  Navy EP-3
surveillance aircraft and a Chinese jet fighter, I had watched the news with
mild interest.  This was mostly due to the proximity of Guam to China.  I
never dreamed that I would play a role in this intensely watched
international drama.
Somewhere in the negotiations between the United States and the Chinese
Governments, it was decided that a civilian aircraft should be sent to
retrieve the 24 crewmembers being detained on Hainan Island, China.  A call
was made to Continental Airlines headquarters in Houston, Texas.
Continental was chosen because of its Guam base and its ability to launch
this kind of operation at a moment s notice.  From there, the operation took
shape through the tireless efforts of many people working behind the scenes
in a coordinated effort between the airline, the military, and the State
Department.
On Saturday, April 7, 2001, I received a call at home from Captain Ralph
Freeman, Continental Micronesia Director of Flight Operations.  Ralph told
me that the military wanted to charter one of our jets to conduct a rescue
mission and asked if I would be one of the crewmembers.  I said yes without
hesitation.
Later we were told that we would need to get passport pictures taken in case
the Chinese Government required visas.  We got the required photos and were
under the impression that we would leave immediately.  However, the
negotiations slowed over the demand from the Chinese that the U.S.  issue an
apology that the U.S.  was unwilling to give.  Meanwhile, the Continental
crew remained on call 24 hours a day.  Our Uniforms were laid out and our
bags were packed and waiting by the door.
On Wednesday evening April 11, 2001, at about 6:30 PM Ralph called again to
say that the two parties were very close to an agreement to release the U.S.
crew and to come to the airport.  Upon arrival, we were given a briefing
sheet listing the information that we would need to conduct the flight.
We would carry a Repatriation Team consisting of Navy, Marine Corps, and Air
Force specialists, 14 people in all.  Doctors, Psychologists, and
communications people with lots of gear showed up on the ramp near the
airplane, ready to board.  They were all dressed in casual civilian clothes.
The 155-seat jet was fitted with 2 full stretcher kits bolted in over rows
of seats complete with Oxygen tanks and I.V.  bottles.  They did not know
the condition of the
24 detained crewmembers and they were not going to take any chances.  They
were prepared.
When our crew was fully assembled, it consisted of 11 people.  2 pilots to
fly the jet and an extra to provide relief because of the extensive flight
time involved.
They were Captain Tom Pinardo, Captain Pierre Frenay and I.  We also carried
5 very experienced Flight Attendants.
They were Debbie Percell, Susanne Hendricks, Jean Tang, Cynthia Iverson, and
Beverly Haines.  Our 2 onboard mechanics were Peter Lum and Julius Aguilo.
Our load planner was Mike Torres.
At about 9:30 PM we received a call asking that we arrive in China no
earlier than 6:00 AM, just about sunrise.  It was obvious that the entire
exchange would be photographed and they wanted daylight conditions.  We
estimated that a 2:15 AM departure from Guam would put us on the ground in
Haikou precisely at 6:00 AM local China time.  (2 hours earlier than Guam)
Some of us just stayed on the plane, others accepted the company s
invitation to come to the Continental President s Club, a local VIP lounge
at the airport to try to get some rest.  It was difficult to get any rest
with our much-anticipated mission so near.
By 1:00 AM the pilots were back in the briefing room going over the weather,
flight plan, fuel requirements and everything else that goes into a flight.
Again, we loaded up the airplane and finally departed Guam International at
precisely 2:15 AM.
The stretcher kits and medical gear were not the only special additions to
the airplane.  The company had loaded a special file into the navigation
database of the flight management computer (FMC).  This allowed us to gain
access to navigation data needed to operate in this part of China, which is
not in our normal route structure.  The Repatriation Team carried
sophisticated equipment to communicate with the military and government
officials that would monitor our progress throughout the flight.
The route of flight took us straight west from Guam toward the Philippines
along the G467 airway.  About half way across we turned north directly
toward Hong Kong.
This routing was designed to avoid flying through Taiwanese airspace,
something that the Chinese could consider offensive.
Approaching the Chinese coastline, we contacted Hong Kong radar control.
After establishing radar contact with us, the controller gave us a short cut
to expedite his traffic flow.  This was bad because it cut off considerable
distance and would result in arriving too early.  We compensated by slowing
our airspeed until the computer again estimated a 6:00 AM arrival.  The
instant we turned across the short cut, the interphone rang from the back of
the plane.  They wanted to know why we had deviated from the flight plan.
We told them it was due to Hong Kong traffic and that we had adjusted our
airspeed.
We were still on schedule.
Now we were approaching our destination, Haikou airport on Hainan Island.
Captain Pierre Frenay was at the controls.  The weather was 2000-ft overcast
with 5 miles visibility and light winds out of the east.  Pierre made an ILS
approach to and landed on runway 9.  Haikou airport is much the same as many
other airports in the world that serve jet transport aircraft.  It has an
11,000-ft runway with standard lighting and navigational facilities.  We
touched down at 6:07 AM.  The first early morning light was beginning to
illuminate the sky.
The local air traffic controller instructed us to follow a vehicle that was
beside us on an adjacent taxiway.  He led us to a remote part of the
airport, away from the main terminal buildings.  Once we had parked and shut
down the engines, we saw many uniformed Chinese military personnel and
vehicles.  They did not appear to have weapons.  Portable stairs were
brought up to the airplane and we opened the main cabin door.
The Repatriation Team that we carried had been briefed to close down all of
their communications equipment prior to landing and put it away.  They were
also briefed to remain in their seats in a non-threatening posture in case
the Chinese military came aboard.  The first and only person to come aboard
was an Air China employee.  He spoke English and was to act as the
translator between our group and the Chinese military.  He instructed us to
have everyone fill out both arrival and departure documents.
He collected all of our passports and left the aircraft.
Before he left, he said that only one person at a time would be allowed to
deplane.
Peter Lum, one of our mechanics went down to supervise the re-fueling and
servicing of the airplane.  When that was complete, I went down to do the
walk-around inspection.  I did this rather slowly because I wanted to have a
chance to look around.  While I was out on the ramp, a skirmish developed
between people who were trying to climb a wall to photograph our aircraft
and the Chinese police.  Somehow, CNN managed to carry our arrival and
departure live.
Once the airplane was serviced and ready to go, we looked anxiously around
for any sign of the buses that carried our 24 detainees.  Before that could
happen however, we had a problem to deal with.  A U.S.  military General who
was on the scene to assist in the transfer came storming up the stairs and
demanded to speak with the Captain.  Tom Pinardo responded.  The General
said that the entire mission was now in jeopardy.  A document called the
general declaration, which is standard on all international flights had
listed the destination as Haikou, China R.O.C.  The initials ROC stand for
Republic of China which is ..  Taiwan!  The Chinese were very upset over
this.  Tom quickly crossed out ROC and replaced it with P.R.O.C.  the
Peoples Republic of China.  This seemed to satisfy them.
With the airplane ready to go and the paperwork complete,
2 buses pulled up and the 24 U.S.  service men and women saluted as they
bolted up the stairs and settled into the back of the plane.  When the last
one was aboard, our passports were returned to us.  The stairs were
withdrawn, the cabin door closed, and we started the engines and departed.
It was my turn at the controls.
Once airborne heading straight south we broke through the clouds into the
bright sunshine.  Pierre made a PA announcement that we were over
international waters and leaving Chinese airspace.  A great cheer rose from
the back of the airplane.  A short while later we received a telephone patch
over the HF radio from Mr.  Joseph Prueher, U.S Ambassador to China.  He
wanted to speak with Lt.  Shane Osborne the 26 year old EP-3 Aircraft
Commander.  Lt.  Osborne came to the cockpit and put on a headset.  The
Ambassador told him that on behalf of the President of the United States and
the entire country he wanted to say welcome home .  He went on to say how
proud he was of everything the crew had done from their airmanship in saving
the lives of the crew and aircraft, to their conduct on the ground once they
had been detained.  They had truly done an excellent job.
After his conversation with the Ambassador, Lt.  Osborne stayed in the
cockpit for quite a while and told us his story pilot to pilot of what had
happened during and immediately after the mid-air collision with the F-8
Chinese fighter.  The fighter came up under their left wing.  This pilot
made 2 very close passes previously that day.  He apparently misjudged the
intercept and his vertical stabilizer struck the outboard left propeller on
the EP-3.  The U.S.  plane was in straight and level flight on autopilot at
the time.
The fighter broke into two pieces and plunged into the sea.  The U.S.  plane
rolled to the left almost inverted, the pilot lost control and they began to
lose altitude.
The Chinese fighter had raked back across the fuselage and knocked off the
nose cone causing the aircraft to buffet wildly.  When the nose cone
departed the aircraft it collided with and damaged the number 4 propeller on
the right wing.  The collision punctured the pressure vessel and the EP-3
depressurized.  The collision also knocked off the pitot tubes eliminating
airspeed and altitude indications in the cockpit.  It also knocked off the
forward bracket for the HF radio antenna.  The antenna then flew back and
wrapped around the tail.
We were almost upside down and totally out of control Osborne told us.  The
dive continued and some crew members donned parachutes.  At about 8,000
feet, Osborne regained straight and level flight.  They considered ditching
the aircraft in the South China Sea but dismissed that option because it was
certain to result in loss of life.  They headed for the nearest land, Hainan
Island.  The U.S.  crew now faced the most difficult landing of their lives.
They made numerous mayday, mayday, mayday radio calls on internationally
recognized emergency frequencies.  The Chinese did not respond.  Somehow,
they managed to get the airplane on the ground.
Their next immediate task was to destroy the sensitive electronic
surveillance equipment aboard the EP-3.
Meanwhile the Chinese military had approached the aircraft in vehicles and
were yelling at them through loudspeakers to deplane.  The next 11 days
would be a very uncertain time for them.
When we met them, they told us that they had not been abused or mistreated.
Their food was adequate and plentiful.  Sort of like eating in a Chinese
restaurant every day one of them said.  On the forth day, they got some
coffee.  On the fifth day, some cokes were provided.
The crew did not know what kind of transport would be provided for their
return home.  They were pleased and surprised to see a chartered airliner
from the United States.
The rest of the flight from Haikou to Anderson AFB on Guam was uneventful.
During the 5 hour flight the crew was treated to the movie Men of Honor and
enjoyed a first class meal.  We did not know it at the time but our landing
at Anderson AFB was carried live on national television.
We taxied to the parking ramp at Anderson where many people had turned out
to welcome all of us home.

Mr. Wolfe,

I just thought that I would let you know the final cost calculations
for the trip that the group has done.  After taking into account the place,
transportation, food, alcohol, skiing, rentals, and other essentials, it
looks like it is gonna run around 1245$/person.  Since you are now making
the big bucks and judging how badly you want to spend time with me, I see
this as an excellent bargain for you.  Let me know if you have any issues.

Ghetto King Capron

PS  Billikins Suck!!

California=01,s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last seve=
ral=20
months.  Unfortunately, this debate has generated more heat than light.  We=
=20
want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.=
 =20
Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation=
=20
and our position on California energy issues.

What happened in California

The source of California=01,s current problem is as straightforward as supp=
ly=20
and demand.  California=01,s economy grew 29 percent since 1998.  This incr=
eased=20
the demand for electricity by 24 percent.  At the same time, regulatory=20
restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state.  So=
=20
demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added.  The resul=
t,=20
predictably, is a shortage.  This summer, peak capacity will be about 10=20
percent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state.

In addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related=
=20
factors that led to the current crisis.  First, the state=01,s regulations=
=20
forced all sales and purchases into the spot market.  The spot market for=
=20
power is extraordinarily volatile.  The way firms behave in a free market=
=20
when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo=
ng=20
term, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.  I=
n=20
California, state regulation prevented this strategy.  This would be the=20
equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th=
e=20
most volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine=20
while the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawat=
t=20
was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price.

Second, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remain=
ed=20
in effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep=20
competition out.  This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa=
le=20
prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the=20
regulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt.

In short, California=01,s problems were caused by regulation, not deregulat=
ion. =20
Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new=
=20
generation from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile=
=20
spot prices.

At the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned=
=20
the state=01,s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, w=
hich,=20
if adopted, would have averted the current crisis.

Enron=01,s Role

Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f=
ix=20
the problem.  Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the=20
politicians and the media.  Here are the facts:

? Other than a small amount of wind power, Enron is not a generator in the=
=20
state of California.  Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the=
=20
same market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a=20
market maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.  We ar=
e=20
interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc=
ts=20
for our customers.
? As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from=
=20
the problems the states=01, utilities, and their customers, now face.  We=
=20
protected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility.

You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply=20
power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on=
=20
the open market.  Early reports mischaracterized this as a =01&turnback=018=
 of our=20
customers to the utilities.  Here are the facts:

? As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California=20
market, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct=
ly=20
from the utilities.  This decision reduced EES=01,s market price risk by=20
allowing EES to access lower utility rates.
? EES did not terminate any customer contracts, and our customers continue =
to=20
receive the financial benefits of their contract prices.
? EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them=
=20
with other energy-related products and services, including assistance in=20
reducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times.

Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its=
=20
crisis; Enron continues to sign up customers in the state; and Enron=20
continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western=
=20
power markets.  Enron=01,s primary business is managing risk for our custom=
ers=20
with solutions customized to meet their needs.  There has never been more=
=20
demand for our products and services.

The Solution

The solution to California=01,s crisis is also straightforward.  In summary=
, the=20
state must increase supply, reduce demand, reduce reliance on the spot mark=
et=20
and shore up the financial stability of the state=01,s utilities.

Increasing Supply

California=01,s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing=
=20
short of Byzantine.  Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les=
s=20
than a year.  In California, it often takes 5 to 7 years.  California simpl=
y=20
must streamline this process.  Ironically, while many of the regulations=20
generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality, the=
=20
regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and=20
displacing current plants, which emit 40 times as much NOx.  California can=
=20
have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new=20
facilities.

Reducing Demand

Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand. =
=20
They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is.  An open retail=
=20
market would trigger demand responses, which would balance supply and deman=
d=20
at lower prices than today.  California should fully open its retail market=
.

Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market

In a truly deregulated market, customers would protect themselves from=20
volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer=
=20
term, fixed-price basis.  The state has instead left procurement in the han=
ds=20
of the utilities, which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market=
. =20
Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the=
ir=20
price risk.

Restoring the Financial Integrity of the State=01,s Institutions

The utilities in California are not paying their bills.  This has led to=20
greater uncertainty in the market, higher costs, and reduced flexibility to=
=20
arrive at lasting solutions.  California must permit its utilities to recov=
er=20
their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and=
=20
distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is=
=20
needed.

Just as important as doing these things, the state must avoid policies that=
,=20
while politically attractive, do not fix the problem or even make matters=
=20
worse.  Price caps have been proposed.  They don=01,t work; have never work=
ed;=20
and they will not work here.  Price caps succeed only in creating shortages=
,=20
which then have to be allocated among competing users.  Imagine how=20
ineffectively the government would be in determining, for example, whether =
it=20
is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall=
ey=20
or Silicon Valley.  Price caps are a surefire way to make the current=20
shortage worse.

The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in=20
California.  There is no reason to believe, and every reason to doubt, that=
=20
the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in,=20
constructing, operating and maintaining assets.  This will also result in=
=20
California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power=20
generation -- which the private sector can do -- instead of education, road=
s=20
and other public goods -- which the private sector cannot do.

As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t=
he=20
crisis from the media, it=01,s important for you to know this:  We at Enron=
 will=20
continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real=20
solutions to the state.

Dear Jason Wolfe:

Thank you for choosing Ameritrade as your discount broker. We have received 
your account application and have opened your account.  Through your account 
application you requested margin approval.  In determining which customers 
will be extended margin privileges Ameritrade considers, among other 
criteria, the following information:

- Employment Information

- Minimum Equity Requirements

Our review of your application revealed that you did not meet the requisite 
criteria for opening a margin account with Ameritrade.  Based on the 
information provided on your account application we will be unable to extend 
credit to you through the use of a margin account.  Your account has been 
approved as a cash account and you may trade accordingly.

We want to assure you that the information used in making this determination 
is proprietary in nature and is for Ameritrade use only.  We have not 
reported the fact that you have been denied the privilege of trading on 
margin to any credit-reporting agency.

On behalf of Ameritrade, we thank you for believing in yourself and choosing 
us as your discount brokerage.  We look forward to providing you the best 
possible trading experience.

Hey Jason,

How are you DaDragon?  I'm doing great.  I emailed you with this account
and datiger12@hotmail.com but your hotmail account kept rejecting my
accounts.  I think you put a block on them.  Anyway, that's great to hear
that you have a great job at Enron.  Is that in Houston right?  If it is,
maybe we can go out for a drink or something?  I know a few places to go
hehehe.

Stocks are bad right now so I don't mess around with them.  Don't assume
that these companies are at rock bottom simply because they are so
low.  They could go lower.  I would wait until things clear up.

Aight, I'll check with you later.  Nice to hear from you again.

Minh

You need:

a gortex coat certified to -40 degrees
a black ski-mask
pantyhose in a dark color
sleeping bag
sombrero
sunglasses or ski-goggles
tights with matching tutu
long underwear (both upper and lower portion)
clogs for those rockin' and rollin' swedish parties
Ski gloves and maybe another set of goof around gloves.
Swim suit cuz our place has a hot tub.
warm hat like they wore in the movie 'Fargo'
And plenty of protection if you know what I mean.

I think this is a pretty comprehensive list.  Let me know if you have any
questions.

Subject: Copping a Plea


A fellow bought a new Mercedes and was out on an interstate
road for a nice evening drive. The top was down, the breeze
was blowing through his hair and he decided to open her up.
As the needle jumped up to 80mph he suddenly saw a flashing
red and blue light behind him. "There ain't no way they can
catch a Mercedes," he thought to himself and opened her up
further. The needle hit 90, 100 110 and finally 120 with the
lights still behind him.
"What in hell am I doing?" he thought and pulled over.
The cop came up to him, took his license without a word and
examined it and the car. "I've had a tough shift and this is
my last pull over. I don't feel like more paperwork so if you
can give me an excuse for your driving that I haven't heard
before you can go!"
"Last week my wife ran off with a cop," the man said, "and I
was afraid you were trying to give her back!"
"Have a nice night", said the officer.

Jason-

Beth and I went to dinner and a movie, very traditional, on Friday.  It
was good fun...have not seen a chick flick in a long time.

Are you asking me if Matt can come out and play on Friday?  Yes, I think
so...if he does not have to be in McAllen for work.  He has been going there
a lot lately to check up on the drilling for work.  I will tell Matt that
you are trying to get a game together.

Kleenex box shoes...if you keep reminding me, I may actually make them, so
mind what you say.

How is work, are they still shamelessly profitting from you hard core
work ethic?

Later,
Tamara

I apologize. You are not clingy. I guess I was just concerned, b/c I don't
want to repeat what happened last time. That is why I thought we, rather I,
I guess, needed more space. If we start doing things together again right
away, then we start dating again or we have all of the weirdness we had last
time.  I don't mean to come off as having an attitude.
I'm just not terribly strong. I can't switch as fast from dating to friends.
It takes me a while. Meanwhile, I need space to make that adjustment.

I still want to do something for your birthday, because I care about you.
Just understand that it isn't that easy for me.

B.

P.S. Marisha might be my roommate.

Personnel and organizational information needs at Enron are diverse and 
changing.  It is critical to the success of Enron that this information be 
accurate and reliable.

Please take a minute of your time and go to PeopleFinder and check your 
information. Look for incorrect Cost Centers, current positions, mailstops 
numbers (ours is 3271), misspelled names or change of name, etc.... (Keep in 
mind that PeopleFinder is linked to the PEP system therefore it is very 
important that all your information be accurate for midyear and end of year 
reviews.) 

 If any changes need to be made please forward them to me.  Once we submit  
the correct information,  HR will be notified in order for the changes to be 
made into SAP and eventually into systems like PEP, Expertfinder, etc.  The 
turnaround for these changes is 24 hours.

NOTE:  Assistants can make changes in PeopleFinder, but due to security 
reasons we cannot make any changes in EHRonline.  Those changes can be made 
only by you.

       Thanks in advance for your help,
                  Alex Saldana ext. 57389

These aren't my top ten, but I thought them useful anyway.





SUBJECT:  ONLY TEN (10)??


Dear Ann Landers:

You recently printed a letter from a man in Rochester,
N.Y., with a list of "Ten Rules for Women." He said he was
sure the females in your reading audience would come up with
a similar list for men. Well, he was right. Here's my list,
which I hope you will print in the interest of fairness:

Ten Rules for Men

1. Pick up your own socks, underwear and dirty clothes.
Clean the bathroom sink when you are finished shaving. We are
not your maid.
2. When you go to the store, ask if we want anything. If you
are fixing yourself something to eat, ask if we would like
something, too.
3. When we tell you we are bothered by something, we don't
expect you to fix the problem. All we want you to do is
listen and be sympathetic.
4. We think you look great, even when you lose your hair.
Combing one side over the top is not an improvement. It looks
stupid, and we are embarrassed for you.
5. We cannot read your mind. If you are angry, tell us why.
Don't hide in front of the computer or TV and pout. When we
ask where you want to go for dinner, don't say, "I don't
care." It's childish.
6. If you need our help to buy a gift for your secretary or
set up a dinner for your mother, please don't ask us at the
last minute. We need time to do it right.
7. Look around the house and see what needs to be fixed, and
then, DO IT. We appreciate a man who takes care of his home.
Just stay away from our tweezers, kitchen appliances, cuticle
scissors and other personal items. Don't use them to cut
carpet or mix paint.
8. The way to our hearts is through consideration. Cook a
meal once in a while. Wash the dishes. Give the kids a bath.
Women love it when a man does these things without being
asked.
9. We know shopping is not your idea of a good time, but you
should know dinner in a sports bar is not our idea of a
romantic night out.
10.We like sex, too, but if we say we have a headache, it's
true. Don't get bent out of shape. Offer us an aspirin, and
tell us to get some rest. We might feel better later, and
your chances will be a lot better. -- Lynn in Philadelphia

Dear Lynn:

Your suggestions are A-Number-One-Super. You've covered
all the bases. If the males who read this follow your
instructions, they will be rewarded handsomely. Count on it.

To further the process of reaching the stated objectives of increasing Enro=
n=20
America=01,s Velocity of Capital and associated Return on Invested Capital,=
 we=20
have decided to create a Capital Book. The Capital Book will have no profit=
=20
target associated with it and will be managed by Joe Deffner. The purpose o=
f=20
creating this book is to ensure that all transactions within Enron Americas=
,=20
with any form of capital requirement, are structured correctly and are=20
allocated the appropriate cost of capital charge.=20

The previous numbers used in the Business Plans at the beginning of this ye=
ar=20
will remain for all transactions in place and where we hold assets.=20
Therefore, on any assets currently held within each business area, the=20
capital charge will remain at 15%. Internal ownership of these assets will =
be=20
maintained by the originating Business Unit subject to the Internal Ownersh=
ip=20
Policy outlined below.

The cost of capital associated with all transactions in Enron Americas will=
=20
be set by Joe. This process is separate and apart from the current RAC=20
process for transactions which will continue unchanged.

Capital investments on balance sheet will continue to accrue a capital char=
ge=20
at the previously established rate of 15%. Transactions which are structure=
d=20
off credit will receive a pure market pass through of the actually incurred=
=20
cost of capital as opposed to the previous 15% across the board charge.=20
Transactions which are structured off balance sheet, but on credit will be=
=20
priced based upon the financial impact on Enron America=01,s overall credit=
=20
capacity.

On transactions that deploy capital through the trading books, the Capital=
=20
Book will take a finance reserve on each transaction, similar to the way th=
e=20
Credit Group takes a credit reserve. This finance reserve will be used=20
specifically to fund the capital required for the transaction. As noted=20
above, the Capital Book will have no budget and will essentially charge out=
=20
to the origination and trading groups at actual cost.

By sending market-based capital pricing signals internally, Enron America=
=01,s=20
sources of capital and liquidity should be better optimized across the=20
organization.=20

Questions regarding the Capital Book can be addressed to:
Joe Deffner  853-7117
Alan Quaintance 345-7731

This Secure ID will be unique to each individual NETeller.com account holder.

Your new Secure ID is: 885892

The Secure ID will be changed and updated approximately every 4 months and 
this change will be emailed to all account holders at that time.

Upon successfully entering the users Account ID and Password, each user will 
be prompted for their Secure ID code.  By entering the Secure ID, users will 
gain access to their account page.  If you forget or lose your Secure ID code

To contribute our personal best at ENRON, our conduct must promote respectful 
and co-operative work relationships. Workplace harassment conflicts with 
ENRON's vision and values and violates Company policy.  Harassment also can 
violate federal and state laws.  By understanding what harassment is and its 
potential harm, we can prevent it in our workplace.

We are pleased to announce that all employees of EWS and EES will receive 
harassment prevention training soon.  This training is mandatory for all 
ENRON employees.

During this training you will:

 Be able to recognize harassment
 Learn to take precautions against being harassed
 Learn to avoid being considered a harasser
 Know how to address a situation involving harassment

I think that your letter is very eloquent,
but I cannot be with you right now.

When you say not to take for granted
the trust, companionship, and love that we
had established, I think that this is
what is hurting most. My trust in you
was really strained with the abortion issue.
I haven't enjoyed your companionship lately, and
although I love you, I cannot get along with
you. I think you have simply taken these
things for granted too long. I've been
a real partner for some time, you
just didn't notice.

I really need some time apart.
I am going to move on, please do the same.

Beth

Gary and I are going to have a "get together" before the Holiday Party on 
Saturday, December 9th.  Please let me know if you want to stop by our place 
before we head out to Enron Field.  We live really only a few miles away from 
downtown, so this could be a good pit stop for all of you that live out in 
the "burbs"!   (No names mentioned).  

Anyway, let me know if you are able to come by and I will give you directions 
to our place.  Hope all of you can make it!

Thanks,
Dawn

Subject: How do officialized books make it to credit?

In the past few months much focus has been put on understanding VAR and how 
it is calculated (through RisktRAC).  However, everyone should note that the 
credit department also receives our information.  Market risk and credit risk 
are inherently different, with different requirements.  This memo serves as a 
reminder of what some of the key differences are, how the credit system uses 
RisktRAC differently from market risk, how this affects us, what some key 
problems are in the credit system caused by our data, and changes to be made 
by risk management groups.

differences are between credit and market risk - you all know this, but many 
of your ba's don't. 
when a book is flat it still has an effect on credit.  Flat books must be 
officialized
market risk is keyed off positions and curves.  When we make money, market 
risk is reduced.  Credit risk is keyed off positions with customers.  When we 
make money, credit risk is increased, as people owe us more money.

how the credit system uses RisktRAC differently from market risk
Market risk picks up all officialized books.  If a book is not officialized 
it does not pick the book up.
Credit picks up all officalized books.  If a book is not officialized, it 
picks up the previous day's position.  Therefore, if positions in book A are 
moved to book B, and A is no longer officialized, credit picks up the 
previous day's position for book A.  As a result, if a book is no longer 
used, please officialize it the first day it is no longer used, so credit 
will pick up 0 on a go forward basis.
Market risk is not concerned with counterparty codes and names.
Credit needs correct counterparty codes and names.  In recent months, the 
counterparty information has deteriorated.  Enron official counterparty names 
need to be used so they flow properly to credit.

what are some key problems in the credit system caused by our data
As referenced above: correct counterparty names and books with 0 positions 
not being officialized so credit picks up previous day info.
As a takeaway from this message please ensure only correct counterparty names 
are used and that if a book has 0 positions that it is officialized the first 
day it has 0 positions.

If you have specific questions about credit, please call Debbie Brackett, at 
X35856.

OK, so I don't know all of you and many others are long estranged.  And
there's nobody estranger than Brewster!  Hey-oohhh!  Yes!

Now that I have tickled your funny bone, I would like to tickle another
bone.  That bone is the one that is interested ushering our mutual friend,
Eric Ellwanger into blissful espousal.  We are throwing what the French
call "un party d' bachelor" for the bon bon homme.  (I do not speak French,
but I think that last bit rhymed.)

I really do not have a lot of information yet, I just wanted to make sure
that everyone keeps the date open.  The main event is Saturday,  May 12th
(a week before the actual wedding).  But, I think we oughta make a weekend,
and then a week of it, since at least Eric and Adam will be free for the
entire week between the bachelor party and the wedding.  It will take place
in Houston, but naturally will have global repercussions.  Out of towners
and drunkards, don't worry about a place to stay, I've got lots of room.

Oh, don't get too excited, but I might be able to get the KLF to perform.
They've got a hip new sound!

In the meantime, I would love to hear any ideas you might have for themes,
party favors, and the like.  Maybe something to do with the Cardinals,
Hawaiian shirts, or malted milk.   Also, if you have any pictures, please
send those along, as the hosts will possibly be developing a website to
chronicle this event.

Sincerely, Clay

7136568246 day
7135281980 night
7136622789 night after April 23rd

> Instead of Astrological Signs, how about these .. What's Your Business
> Sign?
>
> 1) MARKETING
> You are ambitious yet stupid. You chose a marketing degree to avoid
> having to study in college, concentrating instead on drinking and
> socializing which is pretty much what your job responsibilities are now.
> Least compatible with Sales.
>
> 2) SALES
> Laziest of all signs, often referred to as "marketing without a degree."
> You are also self-centered and paranoid. Unless someone calls you and
> begs you to take their money, you like to avoid contact with customers
> so you can "concentrate on the big picture." You seek admiration for
> your golf game throughout your life.
>
> 3) TECHNOLOGY
> Unable to control anything in your personal life, you are instead
> content to completely control everything that happens at your workplace.
> Often even YOU don't understand what you are saying but who the hell can
> tell. It is written that Geeks shall inherit the Earth.
>
> 4) ENGINEERING
> One of only two signs that actually studied in school. It is said that
> engineers place ninety percent of all Personal Ads. You can be happy
> with yourself; your office is full of all the latest "ergodynamic"
> gadgets. However, we all know what is really causing your "carpal tunnel

>
> 5) ACCOUNTING
> The only other sign that studied in school. You are mostly immune from
> office politics. You are the most feared person in the organization;
> combined with your extreme organizational traits, the majority of rumors
> concerning you say that you are completely insane.
>
> 6) HUMAN RESOURCES
> Ironically, given your access to confidential information, you tend to
> be the biggest gossip within the organization. Possibly the only other
> person that does less work than marketing, you are unable to return any
> calls today because you have to get a haircut, have lunch AND then mail
> a letter.
>
> 7) MANAGEMENT/MIDDLE MANAGEMENT
> Catty, cutthroat, yet completely spineless, you are destined to remain
> at your current job for the rest of your life. Unable to make a single
> decision you tend to measure your worth by the number of meetings you
> can schedule for yourself. Best suited to marry other "Middle Managers"
> as everyone in your social circle is a "Middle Manager."
>
> 8) SENIOR MANAGEMENT
> (See above - Same sign, different title)
>
> 9) CUSTOMER SERVICE
> Bright, cheery, positive, you are a fifty-cent cab ride from taking your
> own life. As children very few of you asked your parents for a little
> cubicle for your room and a headset so you could pretend to play
> "Customer Service." Continually passed over for promotions, your best
> bet is to sleep with your manager.
>
> 10) CONSULTANT
> Lacking any specific knowledge, you use acronyms to avoid revealing your
> utter lack of experience. You have convinced yourself that your "skills"
> are in demand and that you could get a higher paying job with any other
> organization in a heartbeat. You will spend an eternity contemplating
> these career opportunities without ever taking direct action.
>
> 11) RECRUITER, "HEADHUNTER"
> As a "person" that profits from the success of others, most people who
> actually work for a living disdain you. Paid on commission and

> correspond directly with fluctuations in the stock market.
>
> 12) PARTNER, PRESIDENT, CEO
> You are brilliant or lucky. Your inability to figure out complex systems
> such as the fax machine suggest the latter.
>
> 13) GOVERNMENT WORKER
> Paid to take days off. Government workers are genius inventors, like the

Sounds good to me.  How's working for enron?  I'm tied up for the next week
or so, but how about a week from friday? (Feb 2)
Let me know, I can probably bring a couple of guys from work as well if we
need more players.
Speaking of players, have you heard from Alan?

Shannan,

How's everything going?
I was hoping to get an actual poker night together this year, so call or
email me when
you are in town. I've talked to Matt recently, and I assume Mike is still
living in Houston.

Subject: Re: Fwd: Military Courtesy Change  

OK,

A. Why did they not respect him for all 8 years? When Clinton came into 
office, he didn't have that
much negative publicity. GW has had as much for his DWI, cocaine use, getting 
into Nat Guard through
father's connections, etc
Clinton had plenty of negative attention when he came on board, remember the 
affairs (yes, plural), not inhaling, dodging the draft, etc.
I know I am not exaggerating on that.....  We can all thank Clinton for any 
overdone media coverage on future presidents. 

B. Why is GW deserving of so much military respect? He has not exactly been a 
paragon of clean living. 
Also, he got into the "champagne unit" of the National Guard ahead of 
hundreds of other more qualified
people, according to time on the wait list, and extrance exams. 
GW is trying to set a new "tone" in DC, which, I for one, respect.  Something 
had to be done after the negative Clinton years.  Yes, he may have done some 
good for the country, but he did not do anything to earn the respect he may 
have gotten, which I hope was little.
And, please....atleast he wasn't taking pictures for journalism papers...he 
was flying planes which takes a little more intelligance!

I'll either collect at the party, or else I might appoint a treasurer.
Either away, your spot is reserved in the honeywagon.

Beotch,
I will be there in June.  You'd better recognize.

You just keep sitting up in your cozy little corporate office, making that
mad bank until I get there, then get ready to lose a couple $2.00 hands of
poker.....

I have decided to take another route with the ski trip.  Instead of getting
more people to go, I am thinking that it should be just us two.    Maybe we
get a nice one room cabin with a fireplace, a warm bear rug, some cocoa.
Maybe some wine and candles to create a mood.  What do you think?

Hey!  Beth said I should e-mail you about possible jobs with Enron.  I'm 
locked in at the Capitol through the beginning of June.  We're in the middle 
of Legislative Session and I made a commitment to stay till the end.  I would 
definitely be interested in finding out about working at Enron though.  Any 
details you could provide would be much appreciated.

I told Beth that ya'll should come visit.  I really enjoyed having ya'll live 
so close.  Anyway, I'll talk to you soon!

Subject: mardi gras!


all,

welcom to the official invite of the guidroz brothers mardi gras bash to be
held by me and my little brother (yes there is another) at his house in the
most beautiful and decadent city in america, new orleans.

first of all let me tell you if you have made it on this list, you are very
special to me and therefore entitled to all and any hospitality in my home
town.  there is no such thing as imposition. SO...

MARDI GRAS: what the fuck is it??  well you have heard me talk of it, but
here is a quick overview with some helpful links.  mardi gras is officially
the biggest party in america.  it is the catholic celebration of fat tuesday
and ment to get all of your partying out of your system as you enter lent
(ash wednesday). here are some links for more information and you can also
email me with questions.

http://www.mardigrasday.com

http://www.mardigras.com

http://www.fattuesday.com

also for information about my wonderful city of new orleans

http://www.nola.com

http://www.neworleans.com

this year mardi gras day is on tuesday, feburary 27th. but this is just the
last and most decadent day, the grande finally so to speak.  the party
starts about 2 weeks before and gets more manic as fat tuesday approches. so
here are the date options.

my brothers house is open to us from tuesday the 14th of feburary until
friday the 3rd of march.  you will want to be there definately for either or
both weekends of the 16th-18th and the weekend of the 22ond-24th.  the later
being more hardcore partying than the first.  if you would like to visit the
city and surrounding area (ie. river road plantations, the swamps, the
cemetaries, etc.) and some of mardi gras you would want to plan for the
first week and weekend.  if your all about not remembering what the hell you
did, but had fun, the second weekend through fat tuesday would be your bag.
of course your welcom for the 2 weeks as well.

What we provide.  my brother and i have been doing this for several years
now.  it is his job to provide the house and my job to fill it up with the
most fun and interesting people i can, thats why you guys are on my list!
it can really get crazy downtown so my brother and i kind of act as tour
guides.  also, if enough of us come, we are going to plan a crawfish boil.
(yes eric, crawfish cajun style! none of that salty cold sweedish stuff) all
you have to do is:

email me when your flight gets in to New Orleans International airport and
either you can take a cab (real close to my bros house) or someone will meet
you there.

then just tag along with the group or do your own thing.  my brother has a 3
bedroom house a few couches so chances are everyone (including me) will be
crashing all over the place, so bring some sort of backpacker type gear
(sleeping bag and stuff).

ok then.  thats it.  ill be there from the 14th to the 28th, tenitavely,
will nail that down soon.  so as we say in new orleans, "lassiere la bon
temps roullete!"

guidroz

Yes, I am completely recovered. I was just getting ready for the blacks
when I was forced to watch basketball on the last day.

In my NCAA pool I got 6 of the elite 8 and ALL final 4 teams.. that of
course includes my beautiful upset picks of Ariz and Maryland.
However, there is one other guy who has the same remaining bracket
and is 2 pts ahead, so I will not get the $300 for first. But if Mich St
beats
Ariz I get the $100 second place. If Ariz wins it goes to a tiebreaker on
pts
in the final. I have 145 pts, the other guy has 165.

I also won Ellwanger's work pool.
