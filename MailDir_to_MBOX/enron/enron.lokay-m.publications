We will see record numbers of new powerplants coming on line this year. New, much larger RTOs promise dramatic increases in liquidity.

Price volatility will continue, and risk management techniques will continue to be honed.

We will see record numbers of new powerplants coming 
on line this year. New, much larger RTOs promise 
dramatic increases in liquidity. The Enron fallout will 
continue to force balance sheet improvements-- perhaps 
more mergers and acquisitions. Price volatility will 
continue, and risk management techniques will continue 
to be honed. <p>

Come hear the experts who will help you survive and 
thrive in 2002!

 <http://www.eyeforenergy.com/>	 Three trading conferences under one roof...
at the Hotel Okura, Amsterdam, 19-21 February 2002	 
 <http://www.eyeforenergy.com/weather/>

Over 70% of European companies
face weather-related risk

Today's business has become all about risk and how to mitigate it. Weather derivatives have become one of the key tools industries as wide ranging as utilities, airlines, agriculture have at hand to offset risks associated with temperature and precipitation.

So how do you take advantage of this new market in weather trading that has emerged in Europe? What key issues do you have to be aware of to mitigate your operational and trading risks through weather? Amsterdam will be the place for traders, marketers, exchanges, brokers, and executives powering the weather trading industry to network with each other.

 	 
Speakers at this event will include:

Aquila, Systeia Capital Management, Mirant, LIFFE, Element Re, Entergy-Koch Trading, Risk Management Solutions, Centrica, Utilicorp, weatherXchange, Aon Capital Markets and many more <http://193.128.182.100:8081/ss?click&eyeforenergy&3c459583>...

UBS Warburg estimates that profits
from European power trading alone
will top $2.4 billion in 2002

Add natural gas and oil and you're looking at a huge pot of pure profit, only available to those companies that know how to best take advantage of the rise of deregulation and online trading in the European market. 

Now in its 3rd year, this is THE conference where the European Energy Industry talks about the business of energy trading. Case studies from traders, brokers, online exchanges and energy companies to help you stay at the forefront of the exploding energy trading market.

 	 
Speakers at this event will include:

Dynegy, Altra Energy, OM Group, Powergen, Bergen-Energi, Amsterdam Power Exchange, RWE Trading, ENDESA, The Utilities Exchange, TXU, SchlumbergerSema

"Carbon credits represent a significant asset that companies ignore at their peril"
Jonathan Johns, Ernst & Young

Emission trading options are ripe for the picking - but how can you make sure you're ready to profit from GHG? Let's face it - you really can't afford not to be, especially as the World Bank has estimated demand in the international GHG trading system to be in the order of US$20 billion per annum by 2010.

Eyeforenergy is delighted to bring you this event which will focus on how you can best seize this exciting new market opportunity.

Dear Colleague: 

Energy Argus has just launched two new bi-monthly publications that focus on the European and Asian energy markets - Argus Power Europe and Argus Asia Gas & Power. 

AND - we'd like to offer you a FREE no-obligation trial to both! 

Why Argus Power Europe and Argus Asia Gas & Power? 

Because you need to know what's going on in the international markets. These markets are deregulating and expanding, causing opportunities overseas - and threatening to steal away your own domestic opportunies as well. Now more than ever, you need to be in the know and stay ahead of your competition and to take advantage of these new business opportunities. 

Argus Power Europe covers these essential issues: 


   * Consolidation - who's buying what, and why; 

   * New developments - who's building what and when -and what equipment they need; 

   * Price trends and analysis; 

   * Analysis of the differences in the European markets - from the Nordic market's complex structure and the dominant UK and German markets to the EU expansion's impact on new markets in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland. 

   * Much, much more! 

Argus Asia Gas & Power covers the electricity and natural gas markets in Asia - from upstream to downstream. 

   * It's power coverage focuses on restructuring, financing, competition and demand (both residential and commercial). 

   * It's gas coverage focuses on supply to and from the Asia region - including proposals to ship for the first time liquefied natural gas from Asia and Australia to the US West Coast, a development that may have a serious impact on the US's involvement in the region's gas industry. 

   * Our news coverage also details new developments - who's building what and when -and what equipment they need;

Welcome to this week's Eyeforenergy Update.  Just to refresh your memories,
this update is sent to you, alternating each week with the main Eyeforenergy
Briefing to let you know of any developments on the Eyeforenergy.com
website, including publication of new stories, whitepapers and special
features, as well as the latest news on our upcoming conferences.

If you visit our homepage www.eyeforenergy.com, you will see that our newest
Featured Content is a special report, commissioned by Norsk Hydro ASA and
produced by the Center for International Climate and Environmental Research
- Oslo.  This takes a look at the current status of climate negotiations and
the Kyoto agreement, particularly after COP7 towards the end of last year.
It's most interesting aspect for Eyeforenergy readers is how it takes a look
at implications for business in terms of compliance, mechanisms and funding,
even for countries which have chosen not to ratify Kyoto such as the USA.
Scroll down the page to read the full report...

On the same subject, early discounted registration is now available for our
CO2 Trading: The North American Market conference, 18-20 June in Chicago,
which already has companies such as DuPont, Entergy, TransAlta, Natsource,
Entergy and Cinergy on board.  Look out for the full program for this event,
which will be published on our website tomorrow.  We can also announce that
the number of industries who will be talking about their energy management
strategies for the first time at Strategy Energy Management USA is growing,
including the likes of International Paper, North Star Steel, Nestl? and
more.  Keep an Eye on future Eyeforenergy Updates for more information as it
becomes available.

Lastly, we are now taking early no-obligation applications for our
forthcoming members only Premium Content subscription area, which will
entitle you to a discount off the already very low price.  See down for
further details...

NEW WHITEPAPER

An evaluation of business implications of the Kyoto Protocol

This report was originally commissioned by Norsk Hydro ASA, and it's aim is
to present and analyze the newest developments in the climate negotiations,
particularly the seventh Conference of the Parties to the Climate Convention
in Marrakech, Morocco, in October/November 2001, and to provide an
evaluation of what the finalized Kyoto Protocol means for business.

Eyeforenergy thanks and acknowledges the author Dr Asbj?rn Torvanger
(asbjorn.torvanger@cicero.uio.no) and CICERO (Center for International
Climate and Environmental Research - Oslo), on whose website it was
originally presented.
