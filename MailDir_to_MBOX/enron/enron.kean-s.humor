Network television is developing a "Texas Version" of "Survivor", the
popular TV show...

Contestants must travel from Amarillo through Fort Worth, Dallas, Houston,
San Antonio, and back to Amarillo, through San Marcos and Lubbock... driving
a Volvo with a bumper sticker that reads:

"I'm for Gore, I'm Gay and I'm Here to Take Your Guns".

The first to complete the round trip is the winner.

The results are in...I've developed the pictures from the 'pub bash' in 
London and this picture takes first prize - no bias intended.  How many pints 
did he have?

On another note, I will be send the photos + negatives via FEDEX today to 
Tracy Ralston's attention.  

Kelly, I've developed a set of doubles, so let me know if you would like to 
see them - there is a great picture of you and Jackie.

Call me a "softie," but I couldn't help passing this one on.  Have a great 
weekend! SRS :-)


First Important Lesson - Everyone's job is important

During my second month of nursing school, our professor gave us a pop quiz. I 
was a conscientious student and had breezed through the questions, until I 
read the last one:

"What is the first name of the woman who cleans the school?"

Surely this was some kind of joke. I had seen the cleaning woman several 
times. She was tall, dark-haired and in her 50's, but how would I know her 
name? I left the question blank.

Just before class ended, one student asked if the last question would count 
toward our quiz grade. "Absolutely," said the professor. "In your careers, 
you will meet many people. All are significant. They deserve your attention 
and care, even if all you do is smile and say 'hello'."

"I've never forgotten that lesson. I also learned her name was Dorothy.


Second Important Lesson - Pickup in the Rain

One night, at 11:30 PM, an older African American woman was standing on the 
side of an Alabama highway trying to endure a lashing rain storm. Her car had 
broken down and she desperately needed a ride. Soaking wet, she decided to 
flag down the next car. A young white man stopped to help her, generally 
unheard of in those conflict-filled 1960s.

The man took her to safety, helped her get assistance and put her into a taxi 
cab. She seemed to be in a big hurry, but   wrote down his address and 
thanked him. Seven days went by and a knock came on the man's door. To his 
surprise, a giant  onsole color TV was delivered to his home.

A special note was attached. It read: "Thank you so much for assisting me on 
the highway the other night. The rain  drenched not only my clothes, but also 
my spirits. Then you came along. Because of you, I was able to make it to my 
dying husband's bedside just before he passed away. God bless you for helping 
me and unselfishly serving others." Sincerely, Mrs. Nat King Cole.

Third Important Lesson - Always remember those who serve.

In the days when an ice cream sundae cost much less, a 10 year old boy 
entered a hotel coffee shop and sat at a table. A waitress put a glass of 
water in front of him. "How much is an ice cream sundae?" he asked.

"Fifty cents," replied the waitress.

The little boy pulled his hand out of his pocket and studied the coins in it. 
"Well, how much is a plain dish of ice cream?" he inquired.

By now more people were waiting for a table and the waitress was growing 
impatient. "Thirty-five cents," she brusquely  replied."

The little boy again counted his coins. "I'll have the plain ice cream," he 
said. The waitress brought the ice cream, put the bill on the table and 
walked away. The boy finished the ice cream, paid the cashier and left.

When the waitress came back, she began to cry as she wiped down the table. 
There, placed neatly beside the empty dish, were two nickels and five pennies 
-- You see, he couldn't have the sundae, because he had to have enough left 
to leave her a tip.

Fourth Important Lesson - The Obstacle in Our Path

In ancient times, a King had a boulder placed on a roadway. Then he hid 
himself and watched to see if anyone would  remove the huge rock.  

Some of the king's wealthiest merchants and courtiers came by and simply 
walked around it. Many loudly blamed the king for not keeping the roads 
clear, but none did anything about getting the stone out of the way. 

Then a peasant came along carrying a load of vegetables. Upon approaching the 
boulder, the peasant laid down his burden and tried to move the stone to the 
side of the road. 

After much pushing and straining, he finally succeeded. After the peasant 
picked up his load of vegetables, he noticed  a purse lying in the road where 
the boulder had been. The purse contained many gold coins ad a note from the 
king indicating that the gold was for the person who removed the boulder from 
the roadway. The peasant learned what many of us never understand: 

Every obstacle presents an opportunity to improve our condition.

Fifth Important Lesson - Giving When it Counts 

Many years ago, when I worked as a volunteer at a hospital, I got to know a 
little girl named Liz who was suffering from a rare and serious disease. Her 
only chance of recovery appeared to be a blood transfusion from her 5-year 
old brother, who had miraculously survived the same disease and had developed 
the antibodies needed to combat the illness.

The doctor explained the situation to her little brother, and asked the 
little boy if he would be willing to give his blood to his sister. 

I saw him hesitate for only a moment before taking a deep breath and saying, 
"Yes, I'll do it if it will save her."

As the transfusion progressed, he lay in bed next to his sister and smiled, 
as we all did, seeing the color returning to her cheeks. Then his face grew 
pale and his smile faded. He looked up at the doctor and asked with a 
trembling  voice, "Will I start to die right away?"

Being young, the little boy had misunderstood the doctor; he thought he was 
going to have to give his sister all of his blood in order to save her.

You see, after all, understanding and attitude, are everything.

Thought you'd get a kick out of this (especially after our recent "hold 
music" activity!)




Try this.   It's for real.   The following is the customer
service number for Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp.

              1-800-578-7453

Dial the number and listen to their greeting message,
until the point when you are requested to choose an
extension, and then you can hang up.
The greeting message is priceless though, and worth the
time it takes to make the toll-free call.

----------


Continuing the current trend of large-scale mergers and acquisitions, it was
announced today at a press conference that Christmas and Chanukah will
merge.  The new mega-holiday will be know as Chrisnuka
>
An industry source said that the deal had been in the works for about 1300
years, ever since the rise of the Muslim Empire.
>
While details were not available at press time, it is believed that the
overhead cost of having twelve days of Christmas and eight days of Chanukah
was becoming prohibitive for both sides. By combining forces, we're  told,
the world will be able to enjoy consistently high-quality service during the
Fifteen Days of Chrisnukah, as the new holiday is being called.  Massive
layoffs are expected, with lords a-leaping and maids a-milking being the
hardest hit. As part of the conditions of the agreement, the letters on the
dreydl, currently in Hebrew, will be replaced by Latin, thus becoming
unintelligible to a wider audience.
>
Also, instead of translating to "A great miracle happened there," the
message on the dreydl will be the more generic "Miraculous stuff happens."
In exchange, it is believed that Jews will be allowed to use Santa Claus and
his vast merchandising resources for buying and delivering their gifts.  In
fact, one of the sticking points holding up the agreement for at least three
hundred years was the question of whether Jewish children could leave milk
and cookies for Santa even after having eaten meat for dinner. A
breakthrough came last year, when Oreos were finally declared to be Kosher.
All sides appeared happy about this.
>
A spokesman for Christmas, Inc., declined to say whether a takeover of
Kwanzaa might not be in the works as well.  He merely pointed out that, were
it not for the independent existence of Kwanzaa, the merger between
Christmas and Chanukah might indeed be seen as an unfair cornering of the
holiday market. Fortunately for all concerned, he said, Kwanzaa will help to
maintain the competitive balance.
>
>He then closed the press conference by leading all present in a rousing
rendition of "Oy, Come All  Ye Faithful."

Fortunately, some of us don't need 50 years to figure most of these things 
out!

                THINGS THAT IT TOOK ME FIFTY YEARS TO LEARN
                                                            (by DAVE BARRY)

1. Never under any circumstances take a sleeping pill and a laxative on the
same night.

2. If you had to identify, in one word, the reason why the human race has not
achieved, and never will achieve, its full potential, that word would be
"meetings."

3. There is a very fine line between "hobby" and "mental illness."

4. People who want to share their religious views with you almost never want
you to share yours with them.

5. And when God, who created the entire universe with all of its glories,
decides to deliver a message to humanity, He WILL NOT use, as His
messenger, a person on cable TV with a bad hairstyle.

6. You should not confuse your career with your life.

7. No matter what happens ... somebody will find a way to take it too
seriously.

8. When trouble arises & things look bad, there is always one individual who
perceives a solution & is willing to take command. Very often, that person is
crazy.

9. Nobody cares if you can't dance well. Just get up and dance.

10. A person who is nice to you, but rude to the waiter, is not a nice person.

11. Never lick a steak knife.

12. Take out the fortune before you eat the cookie.

13. The one thing that unites all human beings, regardless of age, gender,
religion, economic status or ethnic background, is that, deep down inside, we
ALL believe that we are above average drivers.

14. You should never say anything to a woman that even remotely suggests that
you think she's pregnant unless you can see an actual baby emerging from her
at that moment.

Check out the end of the burrito.



THE FRIDAY BURRITO

Ben Zycher from the RAND Corporation used the following line in his talk at
the WPTF General Meeting in Phoenix a few weeks ago. The story takes place
in the good ol' days of the Soviet Union when Brezhnev was Premier.
Brezhnev and the rest of the Politburo one fine May Day were watching the
tanks and missiles pass by the Kremlin Wall, when Leonid noticed in the
middle of the parade a truck carrying a group of civilians.=01; He turned t=
o
Dmitri Ustinov, the Defense Minister, and asked, "Who are they?"=01; Ustino=
v
replied, "Those are our economists.=01; You just wouldn't believe their
destructive potential."

This is appropriate for our time and our situation.=01; The economists
descended upon us when the California market was designed, but we know not
from where.=01; Aliens?=01; Since weaving conspiracy theories is a popular =
past
time in Sacramento ("We just know they are gouging us, them bullies"), I
believe that one must do the same by following the money.=01; I'm not talki=
ng
about the campaign contributions in Gray Davis' pocket. The most money has
gone from power sales in California to the Canadian Province of British
Columbia.=01; It was a plot the Canadians hatched. I mean, look at Governor
Davis.=01; He looks kind of BC-ish.=01; Skinny and lanky, wimpy hair, and a
hesitation in his speech. He talks their language: a mix of misspelled
French ("meet me at the centre"), English, and Eh(?).=01; One night in 1996=
,
the BC government secretly sent us some economists by the truckload to
destroy California.=01; The utilities probably paid for the bus tickets.=01=
; I
happen to know that Frank Wolak, Chair of the ISO Market Surveillance
Committee once lectured at a University in Vancouver, B.C..=01; What more
evidence do you need?=01; The BC Government sent us cheap hydro power, sold=
 at
inflated market prices so that they could do what the citizens of
California wanted to do with their budget largess ? build roads, schools,
and hospitals. They didn't think we could figure out their plot, but we
did.=01; Now is the time for California to counter-attack.=01; We'll send t=
hem
some of our politicians, a bipartisan group including a few who can add,
and some of our select energy thugs from the CPUC and the Blind Oversight
Board.

Speaking of times and situations, there was a time when discussing the ISO,
words such as "communist" and "Nazi" were only uttered, by my pal, Carl
Imparato,.=01; We would shake our heads, and chuckle at Carl's extremism.=
=01; We
aren't laughing now.=01; The descriptors seem to arise again and again in
polite conversation by a wider circle of people.=01; I watch with utter
amusement (because the alternative is retching breakfast) at the
demagoguery of the ISO Governing Board, the Market Despair Team, the
Governor's office, and some members of the California Legislature. Like an
audience watching a tragedy from hell, we scream aloud, "These people are
crazy!"=01; And indeed, they are.=01; Mr. President is not helping us at al=
l by
continuing to wrangle over who gets the musical Chair at FERC ? Bubba Curt
or Bubba Patrick.=01; Listen to us, Mr. President.=01; Let Bubba Curt keep =
the
reigns for a year or two, and let Bubba Patrick take a seat at the table.
We need someone with a shockproof BS detector.=01; Someone who can honestly
field a motion to dismiss the California ISO.=01; The time is long overdue =
to
shoot this horse in the head.

Not all is evil.=01; This week in Houston, the resource capital of Californ=
ia,
I visited the trading floor folks at Dynegy, before attending the WTPF
Board meeting.=01; The coolest thing I saw, besides all the neat gadgets on
each trader's desk, was the coffee machine.=01; Brother Jolly Hayden showed=
 me
how to use it.=01; You pick the type of coffee you want.=01; The contents o=
f the
coffee are in a shot-glass sized plastic tub with a foil top.=01; I picked
Venezuelan #6 Decaffeinated Waxy Crude.=01; The tub is placed inside the
brewing machine, and the start button is pushed.=01; Presto, coffee drips f=
rom
the spout into a waiting cup.=01; I asked Jolly, "How did the hot water get
mixed into the ground beans?"=01; He removed the tub from the machine and
showed me a pin prick hole made in the foil top, and another that was made
at the bottom.=01; Is that neat, or what?

I would like to buy a brewing machine just like the Dynegy coffee machine,
but a little larger.=01; I would set up a booth in Sacramento, on the corne=
r
of 11th and "L", and bark out to passing members of the Legislature, "Free
space shuttle. Come and see life on other planets."=01; They would jump at =
the
chance to visit other planets.=01; I would seat them in the machine, push t=
he
start button, and voila.=01; Dripping out would be the essence of democracy=
.
Don't worry about the holes needed at the top and the bottom.=01; They are
already there, and quite enlarged.

Back to my day at Dynegy.=01; Trade floors might seem similar across
companies, but the small differences speak to the management style embraced
by the crew and its leaders.=01; Each electric trading desk, for various pa=
rts
of the country, is set up a little bit differently.=01; For example, some
desks have a person doing asset-backed trading, but some don't.=01; When I
arrived at 6 a.m., Houston time, the Eastern desk was busy in its trade
day.=01; The Western folks hadn't arrived, yet.=01; Later, I sat with Randy
LeForce of the Western desk.=01; "Captain LeForce, to you", he told me.=01;=
 He
could talk big because Dave Francis, who sits next to Randy, and hangs
witty quotes from the ceiling above his head ("Even a blind pig could make
money in this market"), was on vacation.=01; As the pace of the trading
gathered steam, Randy kept an eye on all the different people working the
Western trading desk.=01; The Captain worked it like a maestro.

During my visit, some Dynegy folks came up to me, introduced themselves,
and said how much they enjoyed the Friday Burrito.=01; I'll tell you what.
There are few things in life that give me as much satisfaction.=01; Complet=
e
strangers who tell you that something you do makes them feel good, well, it
doesn't get any better than that.=01; Garrison Keillor, the well-known auth=
or
of Lake Woebegone Days, and NPR radio entertainer once said a writer should
have an audience.=01; Not everyone in the world should be in the audience, =
but
an audience nonetheless of some people.=01; I now know what he means.=01; A=
nd the
people I met on the trading floor felt like they knew me, and shared with
me their thoughts and opinions on a lot of things.=01;=01; Often they asked=
 me,
"Are those California people really that crazy?"

Since last week, you might have noticed the pace at the FERC has picked up,
somewhat.=01; Last Friday the FERC issued an Order on possible refunds for
alleged overcharges by parties selling to the ISO last January.=01; That wa=
s
news worthy.=01; Then, on Wednesday, the FERC issued an Order to remove
barriers to additional electric generation in the West.=01; The Order admit=
s
that it won't change the dire situation in the West, but these are steps in
the right direction.=01; The FERC also issued on Wednesday a show-cause ord=
er
to AES and Williams regarding the maintenance of RMR units that were called
by the ISO in April and May of 2000.=01; That is a serious case that we mus=
t
watch closely.=01; Also this week, the California Senate kicked off its own
investigation (this will be the tenth such investigation of the California
markets to uncover alleged price manipulation).=01; The Senate Committee wi=
ll
have subpoena rights, and if I understand it correctly, they plan to
subpoena individuals.=01; Sounds like a Kangaroo Court and a Three-Ring
Circus, to me. Thursday, Secretary Abraham stated in a congressional
hearing that the West would certainly experience power outages this summer.
Finally, an LA Times reporter asked me if I had heard that a small QF
company had filed for seizure of SCE property to satisfy an outstanding
debt.=01; That would be step one of the bankruptcy cha-cha.=01; All in all,=
 a
typical week among crazy people.

Let's see what else we can talk about.

My favorite regulator, the California PUC, issued an Order in the
Utilities' Rate Stabilization case to re-open the record on utility audits.
Although the text of the order is unremarkable, the data tables bring up to
date, as of March 8, the outstanding liabilities of PG&E and SCE.

The PG&E commercial paper obligation due as of March 8 increased by $354

purchases increased by $280 million for the same five-week period, now

credits increased $214 million, now totaling $433 million.=01; PG&E's total
default amount is now $3.3 billion excluding amounts yet to be collected
from PG&E customers for DWR purchases.

The SCE balance is as follows: The commercial paper obligation that is due
as of March 8 increased by $260 million since January 31, for a total
default amount of $401 million. SCE defaulted on a significant amount of
long-term debt principal and interest, roughly $249 million.=01; QF purchas=

There is little question that the QFs are taking it on the chin, big time.
In the last five weeks, between January 31 and March 8, the defaulted
payments to the QF owners from both utilities has increased $630 million.
The total QF default for both utilities as of March 8 stands at $1.5

=01;@@@ Be a Source for Energy Price Update

Art O'Donnell, editor and associate publisher of the well-known and widely
read California Energy Market (CEM), is looking for traders willing to
participate in his survey in exchange for receiving an advanced copy.=01; T=
he
Survey is a regular feature in CEM. The information collected by Art is
matched against the responses of the other people he interviews and some
posted sources (Pricewaterhouse Coopers; BPA's daily offerings, for
instance).=01; It is written up in narrative form. The report goes out twic=
e
weekly, once on Wednesday afternoon/evening via e-mail as a courtesy to the
respondents (because the week is pretty much done by then), and a rewrite
on Friday that is e-mailed around 10 am, posted on the newsdata.com Web
site, and published in the newsletter for general consumption. The Friday
report also features a brief story about natural gas markets in the West

The WPTF Board of Directors has allowed me to publicize this offering, and
to explain that if your company is interested in participating, the
information you provide to Art would be protected as confidential.=01; In
Art's words, "The price survey is ? unlike some attempts at creating a
tradable index number (e.g. McGraw-Hill's Power Markets Week index or the
Dow Jones indices), is more of a narrative about the state of the market d
a pulse reading as opposed to a blood pressure number or an EKG. As such, I
do not ask traders and schedulers for precise dollar figures or volumes
associated with specific trades, but rather questions like, 'What's
Mid-Columbia going for today? What about off-peak? How has that changed
since this morning? Oh yeah, why is that? Anything else I should know?'"

The WPTF Board asked Art to explain how the information he collects would
be protected since so many marketers and generators are under State data
subpoenas.=01; Art replied, "The Constitution of the State of California
provides for a blanket immunity against government intrusions for news
gathering from confidential sources and unpublished information, something
which we believe in strongly at Energy NewsData Corporation and which we
are willing to go to jail to protect. So if, for instance, the Attorney
General tried to subpoena me or anyone from my staff about power price
information, we would 1) refuse to divulge anything other than the already
published accounts, 2) send back a copy of the Constitution, 3) contact the
attorneys for the Society of Professional Journalists, and 4) start
preparing a benefit party to raise legal fees. "

If you would like to participate in Art's survey, please e-mail him at

Things in the People's Republic of California
=01;@@@ BPA Misquoted in the WSJ

In last week's Burrito, I referred to a Wall Street Journal article that
portrayed a BPA trader as admonishing the DWR for accepting bids over
market prices.=01; I was surprised when I received the following e-mail fro=
m
BPA's David Mills.=01; His message to me copied a letter he sent to DWR's R=

Hart, explaining what he meant as opposed to what he was quoted as saying.

Dear Ray:

As per our telephone discussion, I just wanted to reiterate a few things
re:the Wall Street Journal article and the quotes attributed to me.=01; At =
no
time during the interview with Ms Smith did I state that I thought that
CDWR's offers were out of line with the prevailing market price in
California or that your traders should check that price before entering the
market.=01; The reporter was quite interested in the price difference betwe=
en
California and the MidC price here in the Northwest and when I asked I told
her that currently that price delta was roughly $50-$100 MWhr, with MidC
being lower than the CA prices.=01; I did not indicate to the reporter that=
 I
thought that CDWR was paying more than the California market price and was
simply trying to make a comparison of price relativity between California
and the Northwest.=01; Lastly, BPA has, on occasion, charged extra-regional
entities less than the prevailing market price but has only done so to
remain consistent with our own pricing strategies.

=01;I apologize for any misconceptions or miscommunications that may have
resulted from this and look forward to a continuing working relationship
between CDWR and BPA.

FERC Staff issued a report with "Recommendations on Prospective Market
Monitoring and Mitigation for the California Wholesale Electric Power

General members are able to participate along with the Board members and

services of Dr. Ben Zycher of the RAND Corporation to help us draft the
policy issues.=01; He will be working with our counsel, Dan Douglass of Art=

In short, our submission will point out the flaws in FERC's proposed
methodology, and demonstrate the shortcomings of narrowly limiting the
definition of producer marginal cost to operating variable cost.=01; Furthe=

excluding measures of credit worthiness are an important missing variable
in the FERC analysis.=01; Next week, I will include a short summary of our

Letters

I received a note from one of our legal beagles that drop me a line every
now and then.=01; I don't have the facts of the case to which this person
refers, but I hope the sender provides us with an update if a judgement
should occur. "Universal Studios wants FERC to find that Universal owes no
penalty to SCE for not interrupting its interruptible load (under a CPUC
rate schedule) because SCE did not adhere to the FERC requirement in the
Dec 15 order to schedule 95% of its load in the day ahead market ......
according to Universal, if SCE had done so, then it would have had to

Position Description:

Dynegy's position has responsibility for the development of transmission
and power markets in a geographic region of the U.S.=01; Duties are driven
primarily by federal, regional, and state activities to restructure and
deregulate the electric power industry, and the need for industry
participants to develop and implement market structures, policies, and
regulations that promote liquid and competitive transmission and power
markets.=01; Significant activity within a region to reshape the structure =
and
operation of the transmission grid is resulting from FERC Order 2000, which
directs the establishment of Regional Transmission Organizations. Extensive
travel (40%-60%, and higher at times) is highly probable. Primary goals of
this position are to:1) Create more liquid and competitive transmission and
power markets;=01; 2) Maximize the value of Dynegy's positions and assets b=
y
working closely with the trading and power groups to develop=01;=01; and
implement commercial strategies that create and capture significant
business opportunities; and 3) Provide timely and accurate information,
market intelligence, and recommendations to clients. 4) Maximize the value
of Dynegy's positions and assets by working closely with the trading and
power groups to develop and implement commercial strategies that create and
capture significant business opportunities; and recommendations to clients.

Interested parties should contact Jolly Hayden at jjha@ngccorp.com.

Odds & Ends (_!_)

First, I would like to welcome WPTF's newest general member, Wellhead
Electric.=01; Hal Dittmer is the founder and president of Wellhead.=01; I h=
ave
known Hal for a couple of years, first as a client for my over priced
consulting services, and later as a friend and source of all kinds of
useful information.=01; Wellhead is one of those QF owners who are owed a
boatload of money.=01; However, Hal's company is developing some new projec=
ts,
and he is looking for prospective power buyers.=01; Hence, his interest in
WPTF is obvious. Wellhead is WPTF's 31st member.

Well, the Dynegy gang has been a source of comfort and joy to me this week.

No wind in my hair
No rain for the hydro

So I called up the Gov'nor
Please energize this line
He said
We haven't built a new plant here since 1969
Last thing I remember

Feb. 2, 2001, 8:06PM

The rest of us should tell California to go fly a kite 

By DAVE BARRY  

When we consider the serious electricity shortage in California, our  
reaction, as concerned Americans, is: Ha ha!  

No, seriously, we are alarmed. Because history teaches us that whatever  
happens to California -- smog, road rage, tofu, coffee that is mainly air, 
cell  phones, the belief that abdominal muscles are attractive, Shirley 
MacLaine,  people taking in-line skating seriously, grandmothers sporting new 
and  flagrantly inappropriate bosoms -- eventually happens to the rest of the 
nation.  Thus it is vital that we analyze the California electricity shortage 
and see if  we can develop a workable solution before we become bored and 
change the  subject.  

Our first question is: What, exactly, is electricity? When we look in our  
Microsoft Encarta encyclopedia, we see that "electricity" is defined  as a 
"class of physical phenomena resulting from the existence of charge  and from 
the interaction of charges." What does this mean, in lay-person's  terms?  

It means that whoever wrote the Microsoft Encarta encyclopedia is a big, fat  
dope. Because we know from our junior-high-school science training that  
electricity is actually a fast-moving herd of electrons, which are tiny  
one-celled animals that can survive in almost any environment except inside 
a  double-A battery, where they die within minutes.  

Electrons are formed when clouds rub together and become excited. This was  
proved in the famous experiment wherein Benjamin Franklin flew a kite during 
a  thunderstorm and was almost killed. Encouraged by this success, Franklin 
went on  to conduct many more electrical experiments, including rolling a 
hoop in a  thunderstorm, playing hopscotch in a thunderstorm and doing 
somersaults in a  thunderstorm.  

Finally one night he was caught wearing only a bonnet and playing Mister  
Pooter Rides the Pony in a thunderstorm, leaving the authorities with no 
choice  but to arrest him and make him ambassador to France.  Nevertheless, 
Franklin had proved an important scientific point, which is  that electricity 
originates inside clouds. There it forms into lightning, which  is attracted 
to the earth by golfers.  

After entering the ground, the electricity hardens into coal, which, when 
dug  up by power companies and burned in big ovens called "generators,"  
turns back into electricity, which is sent in the form of "volts"  (also 
known as "watts," or "rpm" for short) through special  wires with birds 
sitting on them to consumers' homes, where it is transformed by  TV sets into 
commercials for beer, which passes through the consumers and back  into the 
ground, thus completing what is known as a "circuit."  

But enough technical talk. The problem is that California is running out of  
electricity. The situation is so bad that in some hospitals, they don't have  
enough electricity to power those electric-shock paddles that get people's  
hearts started again; instead, the doctors and nurses have to hold hands, 
scuff  their feet across the carpet in unison, then shout "CLEAR!" as they  
touch the patient's chest.  

Who is responsible for California's electricity shortage? You could blame 
the  power companies; or you could blame environmental wackos; or you could 
blame the  entertainment industry, which uses more than 750 billion watts of 
electricity  per day just to blow-dry the hair of the cast of Dawson's Creek; 
or you  could blame (why not?) the Firestone tire company. But you would be 
wrong.  Because obviously the real cause of the California electricity 
shortage is:  college students.  

I base this statement on widespread observation of my son, who is a college  
student, and who personally consumes more electricity than Belgium. If my son 
is  in a room, then every electrical device within 200 yards of that room -- 
every  light, computer, television, stereo, video game, microwave oven, etc. 
-- will be  running. My son doesn't even have to turn the devices on; they 
activate  themselves spontaneously in response to his presence.  

Now take my son and multiply him by the number of college students in  
California, which according to my research is (EDITOR: Please insert number 
of  college students in California) and you see my point, which is (EDITOR: 
Please  insert my point).  

The question is: What can the rest of us do to help our fellow 
countrypersons  in California? The answer is that we can send them our spare 
electricity. Just  imagine what would happen if all the households in this 
great and generous  nation got out their extension cords and connected them 
together, forming a  giant electrical "chain of helping" across the fruited 
plain to the  Golden State! Millions of people would be turned into generous 
smoking lumps of  carbon, that's what. So maybe we should go with Plan B. 
This involves building a  really, really, really big kite.

If you were wondering why Hebert, speaking at the meeting  said that he would 
certainly be viewed as a Grinch, here is a transcript of a poem read on NPR 
last week.  It is meant to be read with the same timing as Dr. Suess's 
Grinch.  Thanks to Leslie Comnes (a California ratepayer whom I hold in high 
regard) for transcribing:

The Whos and Who's Whos in the great Golden State
Love the Christmas light season, the lights are first rate.
They glitter, they sparkle all red, white, and blue-ish,
They impress even Whos who are ACLUish.
They dazzle the neighborhoods hour by hour,
'til someone says, "Shut them off! We're out of power."
Just who is the source of this Christmas light pinch?
Does the great Golden State have its very own Grinch?
Does the smog belching, grease guzzling junk TV creep
Take lights out of Christmas, so children will weep?
We'll catch and declaw him, it sounds rather simple,
Yet much more complex than a Florida dimple.
We'll trap him by leaving a late evening snack out,
Not that he'll see it at night in a blackout.
The Whos grasp at straws, "There's one man who can save us,"
And they hang their Who hopes on their governor, Davis.
"He'll light the state tree, and he'll keep it ablaze, 
and the white fir will glow for the next 30 days!"
The Gov lights the tree, and he says with a scoff,
"30 days? 30 minutes! Now turn that thing off!"
But Davis a Grinch? That would be quite a climb,
His gig's raising money, it takes all his time.
"Who, then?" demand all the Whos and Who's Whos.
"Who cut the juice? Tell us now, we need clues!"
Well, now some blame the cold in the arctic Northwest, 
But others say that power plants close for a rest.
Some say it's FERC, yet don't know what FERC means,
But they think that some FERC jerk messed with power machines.
Some blame El Nino, and some cite Cal-ISO [?],
But no one will rule out H. Ross Perot.
The blackouts are rolling out Stage 1, 2, and 3.
They're saying, "Cut power, de-sparkle your tree!"
Men walk on the moon and invent penicillin, 
So wouldn't you think they could find us a villain?
The Whos and Who's Whos in the great Golden State
See Christmas light evenings start two hours late.
Is it too much to ask, just one culprit to lynch? 
It's just so unfair that we can't find a Grinch!

I'm sorry to clog up your email in boxes, but I found the attached to be

people creating these things?  How do they have the time to design and 
compile this stuff?

> To the citizens of the United States of America,
> In the light of your failure to elect a President of the USA and thus to

> Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will resume monarchical duties

> To aid in the transition to a British Crown Dependency, the following
> rules are introduced with immediate effect:
> 1. You should look up "revocation" in the Oxford English Dictionary.
> Then look up "aluminium".  Check the pronunciation guide.  You will be
> amazed at just how wrong you have been pronouncing it.  Generally, you
> should raise your vocabulary to acceptable levels.  Look up "vocabulary".
> Using the same twenty seven words  interspersed with filler noises such as
> "like" and "you know" is an unacceptable and inefficient form of
> communication.  Look up "interspersed".
> 2. There is no such thing as "US English".  We will let Microsoft know
> on your behalf.
> 3. You should learn to distinguish the English and Australian accents.
> It
> really isn't that hard.
>
> 4. Hollywood will be required occasionally to cast English actors as
> the good guys.
> 5. You should relearn your original national anthem, "God Save The
> Queen", but only after fully carrying out task 1.  We would not want you
> to get confused and give up half way through.
> 6. You should stop playing American "football".  There is only one kind
> of football.  What you refer to as American "football" is not a very good
> game.
> The 2.15% of you who are aware that there is a world outside your borders

Touche'

The Wisdom of Will Rogers

Don't squat with your spurs on.

Good  judgment comes from experience, and a lot of that comes from bad  
judgment.

Lettin' the cat outta the bag is a whole lot easier 'n puttin'  it back in.

If you're ridin' ahead of the herd, take a look back every  now and then to 
make sure it's still there.

If you get to thinkin' you're  a person of some influence, try orderin' 
somebody else's dog  around.

After eating an entire bull, a mountain lion felt so good he  started 
roaring. He kept it up until a hunter came along and shot him... The  moral: 
When you're full of bull, keep your mouth shut.

Never kick a cow  chip on a hot day.

There's two theories to arguin' with a woman. Neither  one works.

If you find yourself in a hole, the first thing to do is stop  diggin'.

Never slap a man who's chewin' tobacco.

It don't take a  genius to spot a goat in a flock of sheep.

Always drink upstream from the  herd.

When you give a lesson in meanness to a critter or a person, don't  be 
surprised if they learn their lesson.

When you're throwin' your weight  around, be ready to have it thrown around 
by somebody else.

The quickest  way to double your money is to fold it over and put it back in 
your  pocket.

Never miss a good chance to shut up.

There are three kinds  of men. The one that learns by reading. The few who 
learn by observation. The  rest of them have to pee on the electric fence 
for  themselves.

Hey gang --
 
I forgot that, after rescheduling three twice due to the events of the past month, Teresa scheduled a meeting for 9:30 this morning with our financial planner.  As a bonus, I'll bring you back his best tips for 401K manipulation in light of our present circumstances!  If I'm needed -- particularly since I sprung this one -- please feel free to call me on my vibrating cellage.  KD -- if I'm needed critically, call.  I can skip if I have to.  I'm getting ready to slam out some more A's for Mary's long list of Q's and hope to focus on that a great deal today.
 
Q: Will Enron senior management lose their bonuses, go to jail, apologize publicly, sit naked in a dunk tank at the next ECafe, donate their life savings to the United Way, and resign immediately?  Also, what happens to Starbucks?
A: Thank you for your thoughtful questions.  On the first one, our review of the situation is underway and no decisions have yet been made, but we welcome your suggestions.  On the second one, beverage service issues will be part of the transition team focus.

that means there is oxygen. If oxygen, that means we can
breathe."

"I am not part of the problem. I am a Democrat."

may or may not make."
 -- Vice President Al Gore

"We're all capable of mistakes, but I do not care to enlighten you on the
mistakes we may or may not have made."
 -- Vice President Al Gore

our air and water that are doing it."
 -- Vice President Al Gore

"Public speaking is very easy."

QUOTATION FROM MR. AL GORE:

                 Gov. Davis Plans To Enact Physics Regulations


LOS ANGELES (NAP) - Encouraged by the success of recent legislative efforts to
control the laws of supply and demand for electricity, Gov. Gray Davis 
announced
today the introduction of new changes to the laws of physics.

"We've been suffering too long at the hands of pin-headed scientists and 
engineers
who can't think outside the box," Gov. Davis said to an enthusiastic crowd 
outside the
UC Berkeley campus.

Gov. Davis blasted opponents who called the plan to regulate basic physics 
equations
"insane" and "impossible." Responded Gov. Davis, "Remember the so-called 
economists who said that price controls lead to shortages.  Well, look who's 
laughing now?!"

The new regulatory program is headed by Professor Eugene 'Skippy'Shepperson 
of UC Berkeley, who has been dubbed the Paul Krugman of electrical 
engineering.

"It's really quite astonishing. By fudging a couple coefficients and 
rearranging Ohm's
law, and a couple other mandates, we can double the efficiency of our 
existing power
plants with no environmental side effects. In fact, with no changes to the 
infrastructure at all. It's a real win-win situation," Skippy claimed.

The regulatory program consists of legislating a decrease in the resistive 
coefficient of copper and aluminum, commonly used in high tension wires.  "We 
should be able to considerably cut down on transmission losses with the new 
regulations. The computer models say that we shouldn't lose any electricity 
at all," Skippy commented in a speech before Gov. Davis took the podium.

Keys to the program include several changes to the famous R=V/I equation, 
so-called Ohm's Law. Details are still forthcoming, as Skippy's address was 
cut short
when his frantic hand waving injured three bystanders.

"I can't believe we let physics get away with being unregulated for so many 
years,"
declared Jeni Flowerpot of the California NIMBY Coalition. "We have some 
serious gripes with chemistry and biology, as well. If we can tinker with 
economics and physics, why the wait to get true pollution control and sexual 
equality?" asked the CNIABEC representative.

The new regulatory program would set an interesting precedent in the state 
that has
given birth to many innovative legislative efforts.  "If this program is 
successful, we have plans to investigate the Second Law of Thermodynamics for 
antitrust violations," Gov. Davis continued to rousing applause.

"Getting something for nothing is every Californian's right!" 

Leading scientists in universities not located in California were skeptical, 
however.
"I want some of what Skippy's been smoking," stated Professor Sara Powell of 
Duke
University in North Carolina. "You can't change the laws of nature when you 
don't
like the results. Physics isn't Calvinball."

Gov. Davis and his supporters were not swayed in their support for Skippy and 
his
new ideas in the field of electrical engineering.

"If this program does fail, we'll have only the greedy out of state electric 
companies to blame. Everybody knows that they rake in excessive profits when
they don't sell electricity," Gov. Davis replied.

You may think you've seen this, but don't be so sure.  There's lots of good 
stuff on this one - takes a while to see it all, but worth it (probably only 
if you're Republican, though!).  Be sure to click on "Palm Beach Pokey,"  
"GORinch," and the other links at the top of the page.  

Have a great weekend!  SRS

Even though I'm a Bush/Cheney supporter, I had to pass this one along...



George Bush and Dick Cheney are enjoying a celebration dinner at a fancy 
Washington restaurant. Their waitress approaches their table tom take their 
order, and she is GORGEOUS.

She asks Cheney what he wants, and he replies,   "I'll have the heart-healthy 
salad."

"Very good, sir," she replies, and turning to Bush she asks,

"And what do you want, Mr. President?"

Bush answers, "How about a quickie?"

Taken aback, the waitress slaps him and says,   "I'm shocked and disappointed 
in you. I thought you were bringing in a new administration that was 
committed to high principles and  morality. I'm sorry I voted for you."

With that, the waitress departed in a huff. Cheney leans over to Bush,and 
says, "Mr. President, I believe that's pronounced 'quiche'
