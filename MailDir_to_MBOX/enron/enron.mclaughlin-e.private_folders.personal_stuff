Errol,

I am still interested in selling the car; I have a couple driving in from
Austin next weekend who are really serious about buying the car. I started a
new business (see below) and need a 4 door car.

The specifications:

1998 Porsche Boxster, Metallic Blue, Black top with black interior, 23,400
miles, $37,500, 17" wheels, CD player, cruise control, heated mirrors, power
seats, automatic climate control, factory alarm, 5-speed, power top, power
windows, remote trunk release, gold Porsche badges (on wheels as well).

Performance:  0-60 mph 6.4 seconds / 150 mph top speed / 201 hp 2.5 liter
flat six engine

Errol - if you are interested let me know ASAP; Jennifer (Austin couple) is
pretty serious about the purchase. I also have a 1995 Triumph Speed Triple
with 8,200 miles (bought new in 8/96) that I am looking to sell for $4,800.
Comes with lots of accessories.

The story:

I bought the car in 10/99 with 5,300 from West Side Infiniti (Houston). An
older gentleman traded in the car for a Q45 (he had the Porsche for a year;
had a hard time getting in and out of the car). The record (call Momentum
Porsche in Houston - all record on file) show that the car had an oil change
at 2,000 miles, 4,200 miles, 14,000 miles (15,000 mile check up). The car
currently has 23,400 miles on it. I have had no problems with the car and is
in perfect running condition.

The original Pirelli P-Zero's lasted me until 21,555 (quite a feat
considering that they run out at 14,000 - 18,000 miles). I replaced the
tires with Pirelli P7000 Super Sports (better 4 season tire and longer tread
life without sacrificing handling). I also had the shop align the car to
factory settings.

The car has been garaged all of the time. I used to work in downtown and
live in downtown so the car barely was driven during the weekdays. The car
is driven more on a daily basis. I used to own a BMW Z3 so taking care of
German cabriolets is comes second hand. The car has never been in a wreck
and is in perfect condition in every aspect. The interior color is black and
again in perfect condition. Please let me if you are interested and I will
be more than happy to let you test drive the car or take it to your mechanic
for an inspection (or arrange a screening with one of the Porsche dealers to
inspect the car).

Please feel free to contact me at either numbers below.

Hey,
I have been sooooo swamped with school and work this week!  Hope your
week has been lots better than mine.  It looks like you have a great job
doing exactly what you've always wanted to do.
Well, Jana is 11 yrs old now so you should feel pretty old 'cause you
are. :)  And she acts like a little lady too.  I know your cousin Lauren
must been close to college by now.  I don't even want to know how old
her brother is.  Wow, how time passes...
Jina is at UH about to graduate this May.  Don't ask me what she is
going to do with a sociology degree but she likes helping people and
working with them.  My parents are doing fine.  My dad is living in
Baton Rouge now.  How are your parents?  Has your father retired yet?
I also wanted to ask you about your boy, Maurice.  I heard he got
married to Demetris and I was kinda hurt he didn't invite me to the
wedding, but C'est la vie.  Tell him I said hello and give me his e-mail

Hey Johnelle,

It's great to here from you again.  Yeah, I'm over at Enron now.  I
manage
the group responsible for all of the natural gas financial trading risk
management.  I've been here for a little over a year now.  It's a great
job
and company, but the hours are unbelievable!!!  The family's good.  How
are
Janna, Gina, (sp) and your mom.  I'm afraid to ask --- how old is Janna
now?  When you tell me, I'm going to feel really old!!  Tell everyone I
said, 'Hi'.  The NYMEX was only open for half the day, so I'm taking
advantage.  Call me when you get a minute!!

Hey Errol,
Over the holidays I heard that you were working at Enron and I thought
I'd
say hi.  How are things going for you?  How's your family doing?  I am
good...just working at Sprint in Finance and going to school for my MBA.
Well, holler back when you get a moment.

Dear Errol,

Hello from Amazon.com.

I've requested a refund of $3.50 to your credit card.  This reflects the

on your next credit card billing statement.

Thank you for writing us at Amazon.com and please feel free to contact us

	Welcome to iwin!
	
	...and a big old thank you for registering...
	
	 Now you are eligible to win prizes just for playing games. No gimmicks. No 
purchase necessary. No  fine print.* 
	
	We have all of these nifty things we call iCoins (some people  still call 
them "points". Weird, eh?) 
	
	Did you feel that? You just earned 10 iCoins for registering.  Wasn't that 
easy? You can earn more iCoins by playing games at: 
	iwin Games 
	
	You then use your iCoins to join drawings for HUGE prizes,  like vacations, 
electronics, or $20,000 in cold, hard cash. To see all the great stuff you 
can win, go to: 
	iwin Prizes 
	
	* When I say "HUGE", you know what I mean, right? Some of the prizes are 
actually HUGE. Meaning - you can't lift them. The other  HUGE prizes are HUGE 
in the AMAZING sense of the word HUGE. Does that make sense? I suppose I 
could go back and change HUGE to AMAZING. But that would interrupt my flow. 
But I ask you this: Who would really want to interrupt my flow? 
	Yes, this is fine print. But it's not about anything important.

Dear Errol Mclaughlin Jr,

Your December 2000 Citibank statement reflected a higher credit line 
than your November statement, because your account earned a credit 
line increase in December. 

An email sent to you on January 15, 2001, was intended as a 
confirmation of that December increase. 

Congratulations once again on your credit line increase.

Wednesday, July 19

Hello alphaman_2001,

Welcome to Yahoo! Sports Fantasy Golf.

You have created a team called E Force, and are now ready to
participate in Fantasy Golf, a weekly game that let's you
compete against other fans from around the world.

Your goal is to earn more points than other managers by
selecting the players who perform the best in actual
professional golf tournaments. Each week you'll pick a team
consisting of two A players, four B players and two C players.
Of these players you'll select a foursome (one A, two B, and
one C) to activate for each round.

The deadline for picking new players for the week's tournament
is Wednesday at 11:59pm PT. The deadline to set your foursome
for each round is 11:59pm PT the night before that round.

Thanks for joining. See you on the green.

--Fantasy Golf Commissioner

destination.  For such passengers on a journey to, from, or with an agreed
stopping place in the United States of America, the Convention and special
contracts of carriage embodied in applicable tariffs provide that the
liability of certain carriers, parties to such special contracts, for death
of or personal injury to passengers is limited in most cases to proven
damages not to exceed U.S. $75,000 per passenger, and that this liability up
to such limit shall not depend on negligence on the part of the carrier.
The limit of liability of U.S. $75,000 above is inclusive of legal fees and
costs except that in case of a claim brought in a state where provision is
made for separate award of legal fees and costs, the limit shall be the sum
of U.S. $58,000 exclusive of legal fees and costs.  For such passengers
traveling by a carrier not a party to such special contracts or on a journey
not to, from, or having an agreed stopping place in the United States of
America, liability of the carrier for death or personal injury to passengers
is limited in most cases to approximately U.S. $10,000 or U.S. $20,000.
The names of carriers, parties to such special contracts, are available at
all ticket offices of such carriers and may be examined on request.
Additional protection can usually be obtained by purchasing insurance from a
private company.  Such insurance is not affected by any limitation of the
carrier's liability under the Warsaw Convention or such special contracts of
carriage.  For further information please consult your airline or insurance
company representative.

NOTICE OF BAGGAGE LIABILITY
Liability for loss, delay, or damage to baggage is limited unless a higher
value is declared in advance and additional chares are paid.  For most
international travel (including domestic portions of international journeys)
the liability limit is approximately $9.07 per pound for checked baggage and
$400 per passenger for unchecked baggage.  For travel wholly between U.S.
points federal rules require any limit on an airline's baggage liability to
be at least $1250 per passenger.  Excess valuation may be declared on
certain types of articles.  Some carriers assume no liability for fragile,
valuable or perishable articles.  Further information may be obtained from
the carrier.

CARRIER RESERVES THE RIGHT TO REFUSE CARRIAGE TO ANY PERSON WHO HAS ACQUIRED
A TICKET IN VIOLATION OF APPLICABLE LAW OR CARRIER''S TARIFFS, RULES OR
REGULATIONS
SUBJECT TO TARIFF REGULATIONS

NOTICE OF INCORPORATED TERMS
Effective January 1, 1983, this notice forms part of the conditions of
contract between the airline and the passenger.  If there is any
inconsistency between the incorporated terms described below and the terms
and conditions in the passenger's ticket, these incorporated terms govern.
	Air transportation to be provided between points in the U.S.
(including its overseas territories and possessions) is subject to the
individual terms of the transporting air carriers, which are herein
incorporated by reference and made part of the contract of carriage.
Foreign air transportation is governed by applicable tariffs on file with
the U.S. and other governments. Incorporated terms may include, but are not
restricted to:
1. Limits on liability for personal injury or death.
2. Limits on liability for baggage, including fragile or perishable goods,
and availability of excess valuation coverage.
3. Claims restrictions, including time periods in which passengers must file
a claim or bring an action against the air carrier.
4. Rights of the air carrier to change terms of the contract.
5. Rules on reconfirmation of reservations, check-in times, and refusal to
carry.
6. Rights of the air carrier and limits on liability for delay or failure to
perform service, including schedule changes, substitution of alternate air
carriers or aircraft and rerouting.
You can obtain additional information on items 1 and 6 above at any U.S.
location where the transporting air carrier's tickets are sold.
	You have the right to inspect the full text of each transporting air
carrier's terms at its airport and city ticket offices.  You also have the
right, upon request, to receive free of charge the full text of the
applicable terms incorporated by reference from each of the transporting air
carriers.  Information on ordering the full text of each air carrier's terms
is available at any U.S. location where the air carrier's tickets are sold.

NOTICE-OVERBOOKING OF FLIGHTS
	Airline flights may be overbooked, and there is a slight chance that
a seat will not be available on a flight for which a person has a confirmed
reservation.  If the flight is overbooked, no one will be denied a seat
until airline personnel first ask for volunteers willing to give up their
reservation in exchange for a payment of the airline's choosing.  If there
are not enough volunteers the airline will deny boarding to other persons in
accordance with its particular boarding priority.  With few exceptions
persons denied boarding involuntarily are entitled to compensation.  The
complete rules for the payment of compensation and each airline's boarding
priorities are available at all airport ticket counters and boarding
locations.  Some airlines do not apply these consumer protections to travel
from some foreign countries, although other consumer protections may be
available.  Check with the airline or your travel agent.

RECONFIRMATION NOTICE
Some international carriers require reconfirmation of your reservations.
Contact the transporting air carrier for the applicable requirements.

country other than the country of departure the Warsaw Convention may be

Though many of you already know, today is my last day here at Enron.  I am leaving to pursue my culinary interests full time and have accepted a baking/pastry apprenticeship with the Deer Valley Resort in Park City, Utah for the winter season.  

I am happy to have spent the past 3 years working with such a fun and intelligent group of people. I sincerely wish all of you the best in your future endeavors.

Please don't hesitate to look me up if you are in the Park City area, vacation planning, or considering some radical career change like this...ha.  It would be great to see old friends up there.  Forwarding info is below:

Dear September Vincent,

Thank you for enrolling in Reliant Energy=01,s eBill service.  We are pleas=
ed
to offer this new service to you.  eBill allows you to view and pay your
Reliant Energy HL&P bills through a secure site on the Internet. There are
no checks to write and no postage is required.

Each month, you will receive an email notifying you that your Reliant
Energy HL&P bill is available at https://ebill.reliantenergy.com/logon/
for viewing and payment. You may choose to pay your bill immediately or
schedule payment for a later date. This will be the only monthly bill you
will receive. Paper billing will discontinue with enrollment to online
billing.

Your bank account will be debited only after you have autorized each
payment. You can confirm payment by checking the status of your bills
through eBill. Your bank statement will also verify payment. All
transactions are secure and convenient. If you participate in the
Automatic Payment Plan (APP), your bank account will be automatically

Hey Errol,
Over the holidays I heard that you were working at Enron and I thought I'd
say hi.  How are things going for you?  How's your family doing?  I am
good...just working at Sprint in Finance and going to school for my MBA.
Well, holler back when you get a moment.

Job Seekers
Are you an energy industry job seeker who wants to find a better career
position?

Hello! I am Matt Richards, President of Powerhighway.com. Powerhighway.com
is an Internet job board that brings you energy industry jobs. We have
recently joined the Energy Jobs Network (EJN) allowing us to offer you
job opportunities from different industry sectors. We decided to partner
with EJN because it gives our members direct access to the entire EJN
jobs database and gives us a steady stream of new job postings every day.
Therefore, if you are an applicant looking for a new career position in
the energy industry, Powerhighway.com will help you quickly find what
you need.

Registration on Powerhighway.com is an easy three-step process that should
take less than five minutes. Once your registration is completed you will
be taken to your personal home page (my desk) where you will be able to
access all of your information and manage your search process. This simple
registration process will allow you to find your ideal job without having
to wade through a list of non-energy related positions. Privacy is a very
important issue when you are job-hunting because you don't want your resume
to show up on your bosses' desk. With our new job board your level of
privacy is your choice with an option to control all of your personal
information.

Our services are free to job seekers with no hidden costs or obligations.
Why not visit us today and let us help you find your dream job. http://www.powe

That's great for Maurice and Demetris!  Maurice will make such a good
dad!

I am doing the U of H Exec MBA program.  I go to school all day Friday
and Saturday every other weekend.  As you can see, this is my weekend
off from class.  The most attractive thing about the program is that
it's only a year long!  So, we started in Jan and graduate in Dec.  This
year has already been intensive though with working full-time and trying
to study, read, and write case studies.  FYI-Enron's VP of Corporate
Finance (Dan Castagnola) is in my class and he is very funny. The class
discussions have been pretty interesting so far and since I am the
youngest person in the class I have learned quite a bit from others.
Almost everything is done in these teams that you stay in all year.  I
know it will be worth it though come December.  I would have liked to
have done UT's program because of the name and recognition but with me
being in Houston already this was most feasible. So, pray for me and I
know everything will be ok.

And yes, you are getting old but I am sure you look as young as you were
in high school 'cause I know I do! (smile)
But no, really, I do! :)

Maurice and Demetrius are doing great, and they just found out that
they're
pregnant!  My dad is still working --- I think they are going to have to
drag him out kicking and screaming.  Where are you going to school?  How
long do you have left?

I'm glad you e-mailed.  It is nice to catch up and see what your doing.

What's up with the 'old' crack!  Baby, I'm just aging like fine wine!!!

Dear Errol,

I'm sorry for the delay. As mentioned in my previous email, your prize was 
requested to be
delivered out late December. However, it seems that there was a confusion on 
our vendor's side
regarding the shipment. I'm checking on it at the moment and will work my 
best to resolve the
problem asap. We seek you kind understanding and patience on this matter and 
will let you know
once the problem has been resolved.
Thanks and though it's already 10days past.. Happy New Year!



Regards,

PLEASE READ AND FOLLOW TO THE LETTER, yes the bolded and unbolded letters.
I was in the room when Lavorato said that if something was "top levelled" it 
was fraud, so lets not
be the ones defrauding the company and having to explain that in Lavorato's 
office.

Thanks
Dutch

If you are asked to top level any dollar amount for any reason by anyone,  
John Lavorato needs to approve that top level before it can go into the
