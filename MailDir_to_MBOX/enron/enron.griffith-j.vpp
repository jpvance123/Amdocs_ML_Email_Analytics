I just heard from Scott, and this second VPP has just closed.  Please write 
up the physical deal tics regarding this add-on piece.  Remember, you will 
not be receiving these second VPP vols physically until March.  When you get 
a chance, please send me the deal tic - EB 3339F.  I will make sure people in 
my area receive a copy.  When we receive the executed docs, I will make you a 
copy.

Per Schroeder, a good number to use for crude basis is the $3.00.  H is 
meeting with Tom [mid con properties] on Tues, and Sam [GC properties] on Wed.

Regarding BTU factors on the gas spreadsheet for the midcon area, these 
factors are all wellhead.  Randy will be providing the tailgate factors to me.

Regarding missing marketing info: MELP has been deleted from the deal and 
South Drew is a PUD, not yet drilled.

GAS
The below spreadsheet has all my info re the gas marketing [still not 
"pretty"] for all the fields except MEPLP & South Drew.  I have an email to 
Harry to find out whom I am to talk to about these 2 fields.  

So far, there are 39 delivery points in the mid continent/Michigan area, 25 
delivery points in the gulf coast area [including the 7 VPP points], approx 
20 points go thru plants, 24 go thru gathering lines.  There is a lot going 
on here.  I know we have not discussed what we might want to take physically 
[and I have not discussed this with anyone on the trading or wellhead desks], 
but my gut feel and recommendation is to take all the crude physically, and 
re gas, take the bigger receipt points that flow directly to a mainline 
connection, and the VPP vols.  

I have updated the basis numbers, updated all the gathering fees, fuel ... 
and using vols that I have been given by KCS, the weighted average basis 
number is around $0.25 [$0.2443, go figure].  I still need MI basis numbers, 
but these s/b positive to NYMEX, which should bring the wtd average down.  I 
think everyone knows this, but keep in mind, I have not read any of the 
contracts, all information is hearsay, all numbers are assuming that the 
current prices and fees are to remain constant for the next 5 yrs, but for 
now, this the best we have, especially since I was given this information 
less than 48 hrs ago - the information received originally from the Houston 
office was incorrect.

In my email yesterday, I wrote that there are several delivery points where 
the pricing is POP.  My initial thinking and concern with this, was that if 
KCS had, let's say, an 80/80 deal, and the marketer sold the gas and the 
NGL's for whatever price(s), then, KCS would get 80% of that amount.  which 
makes it impossible to do a clean hedge.  However, the deals KCS has, is that 
they receive [in this instance, in general] 80% of the residue gas, at a set 
IFGMR price.  Thus, we can decide on a volume, we know the pricing, and we 
can hedge.  No issue.

I did receive a binder today with all the gulf coast gas marketing contracts 
[and briefs].  I have not looked at any of this so I am not sure what all is 
in there, but I do not think gathering, processing... contracts are 
included.  Merrill - by chance, have you reviewed any of these?

I s/b receiving the mid con contracts/briefs on Friday.




OIL

Getting the crude info has been harder than the gas.  There are about 14 
fields in the gulf coast area - totaling a little under 500 BOPD.  There are 
about 16 fields in the mid con/Michigan area - totaling a little over 2,300 
BOPD, of which, 1,440 b/d is sour, and 530 is in Michigan.  For the fields 
Mills Ranch, Oak Hill and Pittsburg, the operator markets the crude under 
their JOA.  Thus, I have no information re these fields.  All the crude is 
termed up for the next month or so, so it will soon be available for you to 
take in kind.  There is no crude under the Hall Houston VPP.

Don - I have highlighted in bold the field where Randy [KCS Tulsa] said the 
oil is, for sure, obviously, sour. At first he was telling me that what 
deemed 40' means is that the crude is sour, but he's really getting a sweet 
price.   Needless to say, he is checking with their crude oil marketing 
person - Tom Kivisto, whom I know you know, to find out what field(s) really 
are sour.  On your chair are the two spreadsheets for each region.  The mid 
con spreadsheet is also below, the gulf coast spreadsheet is only a hard 
copy.  Give me a call and let's discuss.  We are currently using a basis of 
$3.00, and any notional basis number would greatly be appreciated.




Larry - call me and let's talk about what you need.

Lia, Jay Hartman (281.367.8697) has verbally advised us that the SL 14521 #1 
well will be shut-in for a short period and has therefore requested that we 
reduce the existing nomination for 01/2001 at TGT meter 9502 on sitara deal 
540814 from 316 Mmbtu/d (13% of 2,434 Mmbtu/d) to 0.  You indicated you will 
reduce the nomination to 0 for the entire month; we will notify you once 
production re-commences and the nomination should be re-entered at its 
previous level.

Jill, this gas was purchased from Hunt in December by the East Desk, so no 
Wellhead Desk changes are required for this month.

not include a DnB status.  It is my understanding that our East Desk cannot 
schedule St. Mary's gas without a DnB number.  Could you please have a DnB

Joan,

The BOA ticket was established by John Griffith.

Two deal tickets are necessary for St. Mary's in order to segregate that 
portion of the excess volumes on which a firm delivery guarantee to the East 
Desk was made and origination was taken from that portion of the excess 
volumes which are delivered to the desk on an interruptible basis and priced 
accordingly.

George,

There should not be a deal tic for BOA [55941].  The Brazos tic #541136 has 
100% of the VPP vols, which is correct.  The other tic should not exist.  I 
am not sure if you put this in, or if John Griffith did this when the name 
change from St. Mary's to Brazos took place.  Please let me know what I need 
to do in order to get this removed/corrected. 

Also, when things slow down, we need to discuss the 2 deal tics [firm and 
spot].  Per the contract with Preston, there s/b only one tic - all the gas 
at IF TGT + 0.0025.

thanks.

Jesus and Joan,

 I would like to schedule a meeting on both of your calendars sometime on 
Wednesday or Thursday (Jan. 24 or 25) afternoon (after 4 pm.) to discuss the 
final process which is going to be in place for future VPP deals done through 
the Brazo's Funding Vehicle.  This process has evolved quite a bit since our 
original meetings with Tim Proffitt.  In light of how busy the new year has 
become, it is important that Gas Structuring help facilitate the deals along 
and not slow the process down due to lack of information.


Thanks
edm

Subject: Wellhead Group [Gas]


There has been several discussions this past week as to who does what re the 
wellhead book, so I decided to write this out for everyone to understand.

>From now on, we will be going to the wellhead group in order to price out all 
of our wellhead supply.  Our main contact is John Grass.  John is the person 
whom we contact, and it is up to him to bring in someone from origination 
[Gary Bryan, Linda Roberts, Jill Zivley] or not, and he is the person who 
goes to the structuring group to get us our physical premium or discount.  
When it comes time to write up an excess contract or discuss/negotiate the 
excess pricing with the producer, our contact is John, and he will coordinate 
[with legal and origination] the discussions between ENA and the 
producer...of course, Tricia and I will be involved.

actually,  the hedges will be done at close - not pre-hedge by kcs [we have 
been working with credit, but they want something like $28 MM in escrow from 
kcs], so the hedges will be done at close in the name of ect merchant 
investments - then move to brazos.  last nite i called credit to confirm that 
ect merchant investments can do this big hedge - which i assume they can - it 
is enron.  but, i just wanted to cover all bases.

also, i have a question for you - when you guys get physical premium/discount 
numbers, do you go to the basis trader for this, or to an andy ring/susan 
perrira/kelly stevens/tom donohoe trader type? with peoples new roles, not 
sure who is doing what.   thanks.

There should not be a deal tic for BOA [555941].  The Brazos tic #541136 has 
100% of the VPP vols, which is correct.  The other tic should not exist.  I 
have been told that you were the one to input it in, so I am trying to find 
out what needs to be done to remove it.  It is not correct.

Joan,

The BOA ticket was established by John Griffith.

Two deal tickets are necessary for St. Mary's in order to segregate that 
portion of the excess volumes on which a firm delivery guarantee to the East 
Desk was made and origination was taken from that portion of the excess 
volumes which are delivered to the desk on an interruptible basis and priced 
accordingly.

am not sure if you put this in, or if John Griffith did this when the name 
change from St. Mary's to Brazos took place.  Please let me know what I need 
to do in order to get this removed/corrected. 

Also, when things slow down, we need to discuss the 2 deal tics [firm and 
spot].  Per the contract with Preston, there s/b only one tic - all the gas 
at IF TGT + 0.0025.

thanks.

Subject: St. Mary's FEB First of the Month Nom, Myette Point Northwest Field
 St. Mary Parish, LA


for feb,

VPP gas: sitara tic #541136 shows 11,136/d, when it should really be 11,480/d.

The other 344/d is on sitara tic #555941; the two tickets together total 
11,480/d.  You'll remember that the Bank of America tics were established by 
John Griffith's team.

and re the excess gas tics [below], they do not match my first of the month 
[FOM] info below.  Did the FOM change?  

The nom was in fact changed by Hunt at 2:00 pm on 1/31/2001.  Hunt had 
inadvertantly provided you with North Central's nomination for the low volume 
meter, 9502, instead of Preston's nomination.  Thus, the 2,997/d on the North 
Central page (note the 25% WI on your original documentation - I missed this 
clue also) provided to us on 1/25/2001 became 2,012/d on the Preston page 
provided to us on 1/31/2001.

The GDA tic s/b 10% of the total excess amount, and this is less than that.  
Am I missing something?

The Gas Daily ticket won't necessarily be 10% of the total.  Here's what we 
do.  We book the VPP volume on one set of firm tickets (actually 2 sets, 
since the VPP has been broken into a Brazos traunch and a Bank of America 
traunch) - see 541136, 555941, 553654 & 555681 (the last two tickets are the 
internal desk to desk deals).  Then, based on Robert Cook's team's reserve 
review, we book as much excess gas on a second set of firm tickets as the 
reserve report indicates (the Firm Excess volume) - in this case, for the 
month of February, that number is 4,618/d - see 540814 & 594648.  Finally, we 
"book" any residue remaining after the VPP volume and the Firm Excess volume 
on a set of spot, Gas Daily tickets - see 554222 & 555729.  Originally, when 
we mistakenly thought the nomination at meter 9502 was 2,997/d, the 
corresponding spot, Gas Daily volume was 17,216/d minus 11,480/d minus 
4,618/d or 1,118/d.  When the renomination of meter 9502 (a downward 
adjustment of 985/d) took place, the 1,118/d became 133/d.  Thus, the total 
booked, 16,231/d matches the 16,231/d nominated. 

Excess gas priced at IF: sitara tic #540814
Excess gas priced at GDA: sitara tic #554222 

For your information, we deliver herewith a copy of the spreadsheet we will 
use to track this deal for February.

George,

This is a follow up to the hard copies of the first of the month information 
that I put on your chair earlier today.  Below is a summary/break out of the 
volumes and pricing.

The VPP nom should be in the name of Brazos, and the excess in Preston's 
name.  Do you know has Hunt been informed that the VPP nom will be in Brazos' 
name?

It does not matter to me how you break out the VPP vols between the 2 
delivery points - whatever is easiest for you.



This spreadsheet is the same as what is above....
