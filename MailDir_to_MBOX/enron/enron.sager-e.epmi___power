		 Subject: Fwd: Proposed Draft for an EEI Collateral Annex

At the last EEI meeting there was a strong interest in beefing up the 
collateral provisions of the EEI (what a great idea).  Bill McCoy at Morgan 
Stanley was asked to prepare the first draft, a copy of which I am forwarding 
to you for your review. Please review and let either Shari or I know if you 
have any comments or thoughts - while EEI's message does not indicate when 
comments are due ( I have a call into EEI but have not yet heard back), I 
have asked Shari to help coordinate all comments so we can get back in touch 
with EEI within the next week or so.  Thanks for your input.

Andy,  As discussed, heer is MSDW's proposal for a draft version of a
Collateral Annex that can be used in connection with the EEI Agreement
(it would be advisable for a clause to be included in the EEI cover
sheet incorporating the collateral annex by reference).  We are offering
this draft as a starting point for the industry's efforts to develop an
EEI Collateral Annex.  Please feel free to distribute it and let Ed or
me know if you would like to have a conference call with others to
determine the next steps in getting feedback.  Bill McCoy

I am circulating the final of version 2-1 of the Master Agreement.  Those 
making presentations at the March 7 workshop should refer to this version in 
their presentations.  After the thorough going over by our reviewers the past 
two days, I can't imagine anything got missed.  Many thanks to the word 
processing dept. at Jones Day in NY and Fritz for getting the document 
formatted.   If something did not get picked up let me know asap.  No 
unilateral changes will be made unless it was an omission or overlooked 
typo.  Remember, I have all your faxes!

I am also attaching a new flowchart of the into product that Fritz prepared.

Remember, today is the last day we can accept presentations for reproduction 
and insertion in the March 7 conference binders.  Materials must be received 
by 4pm Eastern.  Otherwise, please arrange to have 110 copies of any material 
you want to hand out at the conference sent to the  hotel no later than 
Monday, March 6.

it would help in training future lawyers/staff.

Dear Jane,

Further to our discussions on Friday, I attach a copy of the Energy Trading
Paper prepared by our Washington office.

The paper is relevant to what we are focussing on now with EPSA, and 
discusses:
what is happening in the US and English markets, the legal issues in merchant
power sale contracts, the EEI agreement (on which Enron's EPSA is largely 
based,
or was it vice versa), and compliance issues.

A few of points I found particularly interesting:

* The way in which many of the risks are born seems to be reasonably
settled in the US market/EEI form.  The issue is to what extent Japan
will/should follow the same allocation, on which subject the Enron EPSA seems 
to
be setting the pace, at least for the moment.

* We cannot discount the danger that some of the counterparties in Japan
will in fact become insolvent or choose not to perform.  We have attempted to
cover this in EPSA.

* The treatment of force majeure, particularly non-performance by the
back-to-back supplier/customer, will need more attention as specific fact
situations arise.

* The need for a commercial/legal response system to be in place to
immediately address any failures.

I hope you find the paper useful and, as discussed, I rely on you to 
distribute
it to other persons within Enron who are likely to be interested.

Best regards

Paul Davis

Here is some information.  Jim Steffes (head of gov't affairs for ENA) will 
be talking with Ray Bowen about the possibility of making a similar filing

Subject: Buying power from Industrials

Below is information about a FERC order allowing a power marketer, like EES 
or EPMI, to file to effectively act as an industrials "agent" when buying an 
industrial's excess power to insert into the grid.  Generally, an industrial 
would be required to obtain its own FERC power marketer license (takes about 
60 days) in order to sell into the grid.  EPMI and EES have not requested the 
"Impower" type agent authority yet, but I have been asked to file this for 
EPMI (and, Dennis, we could file for EES too, let me know). 

If FERC allows EPMI and EES to do this, then we would make quarterly filings 
on behalf of any industrials from whom we buy power at wholesale and they 
would not have to make their own FERC power marketer filings.  (Also, Enron 
generally has to also file for "EWG" Exempt Wholesale Generator status due to 
utility rules; however, if the industrial is primarily an industrial business 
in something other than power generation, an EWG determination is not 
required.)

I will keep you advised on the status of the filing(s) once made.

 
Subject: In Power Marketing --FERC order

On 3/30/2000, FERC issued an order accepting InPower's market based rates 
schedule that would permit entities that own generation to meet their own 
loads or for back up purposes (IPPs) to sell power at market based rates to 
InPower (on a profit share basis).  InPower made the filing stating it 
estimated that IPPs in MAIN (and, specifically, Wisconsin) could supply a 
substantial portion of the summer energy shortfalls (FERC did not limit 
ImPower to IPPs in MAIN).  InPower did not name any specific IPPs; however, 
to be eligible under ImPower's program, an IPP must control generation 
primarily for the purpose of meeting on-site demand or providing back-up 
generation and have such generation located on its premises or premises 
approved by the local utility.  Further, the generation must be capable of 
producing electricity either synchronous with the local utilities' grid or 
commensurate with agreements with the local utility.  Total sales made by 
IPPs in ImPower's program would not exceed 1000 MW/ hour.  The IPPs are in 
businesses other than the sale of electricity and are simply seeking 
"incremental return on the often-unused capacity of their generation assets."

When an IPP participates in ImPower's program, it becomes subject to FERC's 
jurisdiction as a "public utility."  

Jacksonville Electric Authority (JEA) protested ImPower's filing stating it 
allows retail customers to arbitrage retail and wholesale power markets by 
purchasing power at average, embedded cost retail rates and simultaneously 
using their generating facilities to sell power at wholesale to ImPower (at 
peak times).  FERC addressed JEA's concerns by saying that the IPPs cannot 
violate any rules and requirements properly imposed on the retail sales made 
to those suppliers.

This order allows ImPower (as an aggregator) to make the required quarterly 
filings for the IPPs and the IPPs do not have to apply for separate market 
based rates authority.  The are some additional reporting requirements FERC 
waived for the IPPs: accounting and reporting, issuance of securities and 
interlocking directorates (an affidavit is still needed). 

Please let me know if you would like a copy of the filing or order.

Mark, Elizabeth & Christian:  I thought you would find this blurb describing 
an article in today's LA Times of particular interest, particularly taking 
into account the magnitude of the talked about rate increases by the 
distribution utilities.  The article does, however, make the link between the 
size of the  possible rate increases and the possibility of a voter 
initiative in CA which, as you know, is an issue that still is on the table 
with CDWR under our proposed contract.  John

CALIF.'S PUC CHIEF TO URGE RATE HIKE
     California's top energy regulator is quoted as saying she
will recommend hiking electricity rates as soon as tomorrow, with
consumers seeing higher utility bills in May, this morning's Los
Angeles Times Reports.
     Dealing directly with grave projections regarding the cost
and supply of power as summer approaches, Loretta Lynch,
president of the California's PUC, noted the rate hikes,
estimated by some sources at 20- to 50-percent, will be
structured so that large energy users, including residential
consumers, will pay the most. Such a structure, she hopes, will
force consumers to save. "We need to move forward, and the PUC
has substantial evidence [to justify a rate hike] that it didn't
have 90 days ago," Lynch, appointed by Gov. Gray Davis to head
the commission, is quoted as saying. Lynch is not apt to take
such a step without the Democratic governor's approval. Davis has
repeatedly noted his opposition to any rate hikes, but Davis
spokesman Steve Maviglio declined to comment, and Lynch would not
elaborate on any talks she had with Davis (Los Angeles Times,
Mar. 26, San Francisco Chronicle, Reuters, Dow Jones Newswires,
Mar. 24 http://www.latimes.com ).

Elizabeth:  I got in touch with Sam.  He agrees that you can do a 
"back-to-back" arrangement in the interim between signing and closing--i.e., 
before you receive the 203 approval for the assignment of the contracts.  
Also, you are correct that there is no statutory or regulatory deadline that 
FERC must meet in granting (or denying) 203 approval.  I can add that in a 
couple of relatively similar and uncontoversial situations with which we have 
been involved recently or are otherwise aware of, 203 approval has been 
received in as short as 45-60 days.  However, it is possible that at this 
time of year, dealing with summer vacations, it could take somewhat longer 
even in the most straightforward cases.  Let me know if you need anything 
else.  Low to high.  Thanks.  John

To all subcommittee members:

    Attached is the final draft which is being sent to TMOS for
approval.  Because the participants voted 7 to 3 to keep sections 5.2
and 5.3 as they are currently drafted, no changes were made to those
sections.  I reviewed and used most of TXU's and Southern's edits
regarding typos and clarification, which I appreciate.  If you would
like to see the changes, then go to Track Changes and highlight on
screen.

    Thank you all for your help. Hopefully this agreement will be
approved at TMOS and then TAC.  I will (or Naim) will keep you apprised.

Subject: WPTF Friday Thin Quality Burrito



Hey Burrito Heads!  It=0F's just another fascinating week in Burrito land.
I spent the better part of this week learning something new, which at my
age is not easy.  In fact, just about everything at my age is getting
more difficult.  But I wont  bore you with the details.  The new thing I
learned was how to be an Examiner on the Board of Examiners for this
year=0F's California Governor=0F's Quality Education and Development Award
(CalQED).  Its an annual shindig for companies, health care
institutions, and schools to compete for the honor of shaking the Gov=0F's
hand, and hearing that your (pick one: company, non-profit, school,
health care institution) are world class.  Being an examiner of the
written applications, and working with a team of peer examiners is all
pro bono on my part.  I am wondering what the hell I got myself into.
I=0F'll tell you more about it some other time.

Speaking of world class, I got two top notch letters this week that I
want to share with you.  One from Ken Lackey of Edison Mission Marketing
and Trading, regarding the May 25 overscheduling on the Silver Peak
intertie by 2900 MW (see Lori Eckman=0F's note to me in last week=0F's
Burrito), and a reply to Ken=0F's letter from George Sladoje, CEO of the
PX.

Ken, who I have known for several years, is a person who doesn=0F't speak
out unless something really bothers him. Ken wrote:

=0F"Since Day 1, I've always wondered what mechanism was in place to
protect against this scenario [overscheduling on an intertie], or if
this scenario would be regarded as a market implementation flaw or
"feature".  I always figured it was a feature, simply because I didn't
think that a hole this large would be unintentionally overlooked.  I
also figured that this feature was available for use by market
participants and that if it became overused, that it would eventually
come under scrutiny by the market compliance police.  I also wondered if
people could use this to change spreads in such a way as to improve
their overall positions.  I also figured that for the most part there is
no such thing as "artificially" high prices since  in my opinion the
market design itself is somewhat artificial.   But now I know the
truth..it's a flaw, it was overlooked and there is no
protection...amazing.

=0F"I certainly do not agree with [George] Sladoje's interpretation of the
PX tariff (that overscheduling across a path constitutes improper
implementation of a generator schedule, which therefore constitutes a
violation of the tariff).   Also I believe that it is completely
inappropriate for the burden of proper functioning of the market to rest
on the shoulders of the market participants (i.e. if someone types in an
incorrect schedule in their PX Trade Application, the market should not
blowup) .  The responsibility of a properly functioning market lies with
the market operator (PX) itself.  PX software should validate that the
proper mechanics have been used by the market participants.

=0F"By the way, it wasn't us who caused this situation, and of course we
would prefer to pay low PX energy prices rather than high, but if we
review this situation and retroactively recreate prices, then perhaps
all other cases in which congestion at tie-points caused high prices
should also be reviewed to see if they are "real".

=0F"By the way, typically, I would not respond to this sort of thing due to
time constraints, however, some of our recent involvement in other
ISO/PXs has highlighted the contrasts between California and other
ISO/PXs.  Each of them, including California, has its strengths and
weaknesses, however, it's in California where the unusual is the norm.=0F"

I sent Ken=0F's letter to George, and his staff at the PX, and George wrote
back the following:

=0F"Because the incident of May 25 is the subject of an official
investigation by the PX Compliance unit, I cannot comment on the
specifics of this matter at this time.  It is likely that the CalPX
Market Monitoring Committee will be involved in the investigation and
the results will likely be presented to the CalPX Board of Governors.
As to the issue of a design flow in the overall California marketplace
--- we are currently reviewing this issue and have requested that the
ISO do the same.

=0F"I disagree with the assertion that CalPX Tariff provision 3.3.2 does
not apply here.  In all major exchange operations the institution not
only provides a forum for trading, but also monitors the activities of
its members, both currently and after the fact.  The participants are
expected to follow the rules.  At one of my previous employers, as an
example, (the Chicago Board of Trade), a suspected abuse or a compliant
from another member or customer results in an investigation by the
Office of Investigations and Audits (the counterpart of CalPX=0F's
Compliance unit).  Depending on the nature of the issue, the
investigation results are presented to the Floor Governors Committee,
Business Conduct Committee or the Financial Compliance Committee.  These
bodies then determine if additional investigation is warranted and if
the issue requires Board of Director action.

=0F"Similarly, the CalPX has the obligation to investigate and take actions
against participants who violate tariff provisions.  Our recently filed
sanction=0F's protocol formalizes the process further and describes a
series of penalties which can be imposed.  Therefore, we believe our
tariff does provide adequate protection.

=0F"Finally, as to whether a comparable event has occurred in the past ---
this will be part of the investigation process and a review of market
design.  Obviously, impact schedule submissions above ATC limits have
happened as a result of free and open markets.  Congestion has become an
almost regular occurrence.  The real issues under investigation in this
incident are magnitude, intent and materiality of impact on our
marketplace.=0F"

Thank you, both Ken and George for those comments.  I am sure we will
hear from other members on the issue.  Lori, don=0F't be silent.  You
started this thing.

Speaking of market design (segues, I am very big on segues this week),
old warrior, dear friend,  and defender of the just, Carl Imparato had a
few things to say about the ISO=0F's proposed utilization of ex post GMMs.
Carl wrote:

=0F"Yesterday, [the ISO Market Analysis Unit] stated that not implementing
after-the-fact GMMs would be a departure from the original vision of the
California market structure.

=0F"Ex post GMMs were NOT a part of the market structure.  When I was at
PG&E and we were developing the tariff in early 1997, no one (not at
PG&E, SCE or any other market participant, to my knowledge) ever
advocated ex post GMMs, and they were NOT included in the tariff.   I
don't recall the words "state estimator" (for calculation such GMMs)
ever being uttered by anyone in a WEPEX stakeholder meeting.

=0F"It was only somewhere in mid-1997, when Alex was working on UFE
equations, that Alex (I believe) suddenly came up with the proposal for
ex post GMMs, and the proposal was taken by ISO very quickly (before it
had ANY discussion in SCUG or any other forum), and was adopted by the
ISO Board (or whatever group passed for the Board at that time).
Immediately thereafter, virtually everyone in SCUG .  We were ignored.

=0F"But even in early 1998, we informally agreed that, in light of the
facts (that after-the-fact GMMs were not part of the original "deal"),
after-the-fact GMM implementation would be given low priority and we
would be given opportunity to discuss this issue before ISO moved
forward.=0F"

I remember those discussions, Carl.  I wonder if deals made in 1998 have
any meaning today?

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

The SCE Pilot Forwards Program, a continuing saga for WPTF,  popped up
again this week.  I visited with Commissioner Bilas on Monday to
encourage him to stay the course, and support the ALJ=0F's preliminary
decision to reject SCE=0F's Application, and cancel the hearings on legal
and procedural grounds.  Dick said that he supported that notion, but he
couldn=0F't guarantee that all his colleagues would.

Alas, two days later, Commissioner Joe Neeper, who clearly had too much
time on his hands this week, issued a public statement which is long,
but here is a taste:

=0F"ALJ Hale=0F's Proposed Decision (PD) is structured so that a "Yes" vote
will terminate the proceeding and a "No" vote will continue the
proceeding to hearings and ultimate resolution.=01;=01; I have concerns wit=
h
the PD.=01; However, I do not intend to issue an alternate because, should
my concerns not be addressed, I have the option to vote "No" which would
have the same effect as the alternate I otherwise would have written....

=0F"If we vote to allow this application to move to hearings, we can later
determine whether the Application should be approved on overall policy
grounds.  The PD dismisses the Application on the grounds that does not
comply with what is known as the buy/sell requirement for utilities to
sell all of their generation into, and purchase all of their energy
needs for their bundled customers out of, the PX.=01; I agree with the ALJ
and the Assigned Commissioner that the Application also must be
compatible with the buy-sell requirement in order to be approved, and
that this threshold decision is therefore necessary.....

=0F"The PD concludes that the Application makes SCE=0F's customers more
vulnerable to market power abuse.=01;In viewing the comments of parties, I
find the concern about market power abuse to be expressed best by
Western Power Trading Forum (WPTF) in its opening brief.=01; WPTF states on
page 7 that, under SCE=0F's proposal, "ESPs will no longer be able to
compete with utilities on the basis of short-run incremental costs in an
open setting" as envisioned by the PPD.=01;Thus, "ESPs would find it
increasingly more difficult to compete with an Edison price which was
neither derived from a transparent PX price nor reflective of the retail
market in which ESPs must participate."  ... The PX price is determined
in an open setting, and would continue to be determined in an open
setting under SCE=0F's proposal....I cannot find that the proposal would
violate the PPD by necessarily leading to abuse of market power.  Market
power concerns should be considered, and weighed against consumer and
other interests.=01; These issues certainly can be explored in greater
depth as policy matters in hearings.

=0F"I do not believe the Application by SCE is in violation of the
Commission=0F's Preferred Policy Decision.=01; The merits of the Applicatio=
n
should be considered through the hearing process and voted upon by the
Commissioners. =0F"

Well, Mr Neeper, justice isn=0F't free.  A hearing is expensive, and what
your are doing is raising the ante of staying in the
game,unnecessarily.  That supports the incumbents (UDCs), and hurts us.

At the time I am writing this Burrito, I do not know if the Commission
took action on this matter today, or punted it to the July 8 meeting.
I=0F'll keep you posted, next week.

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

I am sure most of you have seen the press releases which came out last
week.  First, Dynegy and Illinova are merging, and, second, NEV is being
purchased by AES.  Both Dynegy and NEV are Voting members of WPTF.  I
was going to send Illinova a solicitation letter to join WPTF, but now I
think I=0F'll take that off my =0F"to do=0F"list.

In the NEV deal, the AES Corporation announced that it  has entered into
a definitive agreement to acquire New Energy Ventures  in a transaction
valued at approximately $90 million. AES will acquire all of the
outstanding shares of New  Energy Ventures from its current owners,
UniSource Energy Corporation. and New Energy Holdings, L.L.C. (which is
owned by senior  management of New Energy Ventures).

This is an incredible coincidence.  I was just telling someone, I think
it was Dan Douglass, that we ought to give a special award to Nancy Day
of NEV, who is a big fan of the Burrito, and quite possibly, although I
am not certain, one of the senior managers of that lucky corporation.
Well, heck, she has been at NEV from the beginning, so she deserves all
the financial success in the world, and we wish her well.   I just want
to share with all our Burrito readers that WPTF, a tax-exempt,
non-profit corporation, Tax ID 94-3296987, right here in the State of
California, soon to be a CalQED award winner, is looking for donors for
the soon-to-be-announced Executive Director=0F's fund.  Some of you might
not know about this new [slush] fund. It is intended to provide all the
necessary tools and ancillary needs of late night policy pow wows
attended by the usual wonks and otherwise homeless lobbyists who invade
my private hotel room during the WPTF general meeting, and who want to
discuss high level stuff all through the night.  What=0F's an executive
director to do?  So, Nancy, I was just thinking, we could launch this
program in your honor, with your name all over the thing, and get this
very important and much needed program in place.  At least it will pay
for a hotel room for Curtis who consistently falls asleep during these
meetings on my hotel-room couch while Beth Emery is lecturing him.

By the way, if, God forbid, the deal falls through, then forget I wrote
all this.

Have a great weekend.  Think quality.

Attached is a draft of a PPA/Tolling Agreement that we were negotiating last 
year in connection with the potential disposition of our 99 Peaking Assets.  
I believe you have seen this one before (in fact, I my memory serves my 
correctly you provided significant input).  I hope this is helpful.

Wed. we will be filing our protest (plus, many others will be filing 
protests) that Entergy's filing is discriminatory and not the way to solve 
transmission constraints issues.  Actually, Entergy proposes solving 
constraint issues by not allowing parking at a generation only control area 
and by eliminating netting--both items that we won last year at NERC against 
TVA.  Entergy's filing is a proposal to solve "partial paths", which they 
call "fictional" sinks/sources via elimination of the path.  

Now MAIN and ComEd (specifically stating that it doesn't want us to sink at 
the Enron soon-to-be control area in ComEd) have raised this issue.  We are 
working on a response to ComEd and Dick may be going out to meet with them 
too.  

Finally, DUKE AND CINERGY both told me that while their marketing/traders 
greatly want to protest Entergy's filing, their transmission side won't let 
them.  So both are filing plain vanilla interventions.  We need to again be 
looking for any NERC email blasters that go out from marketers of utilities 
now and into the summer, similar to what SCEM (Southern's marketer) sent out 
last year complaining about TLRs.  If you see any of these, let me know so we 
can possibly send them to FERC staff because it is very difficult to get them 
to take a public position.  PECO Energy is filing a good protest to Entergy.

Subject: Entergy's March 21, 2000 Filing, FERC Docket No. ER00-1933



MAIN ATCSC, C&CSC, EC and OC TP and Control Area Contacts:

MAIN is presently struggling with the issues of how to properly represent
both partial path reservations (those submitted without true source and
sink) and schedules which are not physically realizable in its ATC
calculation and posting process in a way which validly represents the
ability of the transmission system to support power transfers and provides
fair and accurate ATC information to all potential users of the
transmission system.

One of our MIC representatives reported that Entergy has filed a tariff
amendment with a proposal to deal with these issues, and you may wish to
examine the proposed business practices to evaluate the amendment's merits
or potential complications.

If so, below please find instructions for your convenience on how to access
the Entergy tariff filing related to providing valid source and sink
information for evaluation of transmission service, reservations and
schedules:

 The information below provides an electronic link to Entergy's March 21,
2000, filing in FERC Docket No. ER00-1933.  Because the filing is a series
of scanned images, I do not know how to electronically transfer a copy of
the actual filing.  However, if you double-click on the http reference
below, your web browser should take you to a page on the FERC web site.
This FERC page should provide a space for you to enter a "document ID."  In
the space provided, please type in the following

document ID:  2040905

Then hit the [enter] key on your keyboard.  This will bring you to another
FERC web page where you can click on "I=25" (on the far right-hand side of
the screen) which will link you to the 25 imaged pages of Entergy's filing.

Elizabeth:

Here is a set of documents which might be useful as a starting point for your 
situation.  The idea in the transaction for which they were tailored was that 
the California Energy Commission ("CEC") and three California UDC's would 
divert payments they were otherwise  required to make to a blackballed ESP 
into the infamous "Lockbox."  The bank-administrator of the Lockbox was to 
swear in blood to send money coming into the lockbox to our account first and 
dribble any leftovers to the blackballed ESP as they saw fit.  Also,  the 
mili-second that the funds plunked into the Lockbox a virulent "Security 
Interest" attached itself like a vampire to the juggler vein of these funds 
and this security interest was for our benefit.  

 Although I am proud to have the  name Yoder associated with the Lockbox 
concept,  I must in all modesty confess I have never closed out a real deal 
using the damn thing.  Stewart Rosman, an innovative trader who is well known 
for his patience with the legal process,  and later,  John "Big Sky" 
Malowney,   tried valiantly to get Legal to implement this sturcture but 
alas, I cannot yet put it on my resume as a triumph.  Good luck and let me 
know if I can help out in any way with your project.----cgy

Dear Workshop Participants:

Please review the attached agenda proposal for the Houston and NY workshops.  
Generally, participants in the November workshop were placed on the same 
panels and given the same topics for the upcoming workshops.  I reviewed the 
audio tapes of the November workshop to determine these topics.    If you 
want, I can send you a tape of your presentations.  Other than the panelists 
noted, I am assuming you will be participating in both workshops.  Please let 
me know asap if  you want to change what you do in the program.

Generally, I think we need to highlight the changes to the Master since the 
November workshop, esp. product definitions, transmission contingency option, 
and confirmation procedures.   Of course, we need to get version 2.1 of the 
contract ready in advance of the Houston meeting.  We will do a postcard 
mailing to registrants letting them know the revised contract is up on our 
web site.

I also attached the power point presentation used by the contract panels.  If 
you want to change any of the existing slides, please make the change on 
hardcopy and FAX to me - 202-508-5673.   Liz and Fritz, I would like to use 
your into product slides.   If you want to add slides to the contract 
presentations, I would prefer they be handwritten and Faxed to me.  Our art 
department uses a formatting template.

Deadlines:  I need all new and revised presentations & bios, by cob February 
25 for the Houston workshop and cob April 11 for the New York workshop.

Audio visual:  We plan to have an LCD projector for powerpoint and a slide 
projector at the conferences.  Let me know if you have any other requirements.

Speaker's Dinners:  We plan to organize speaker dinners the night before the 
workshops.   Details to follow.

Finally, feel free to market the workshops to  your colleagues and 
counterparties.  I am attaching the latest version of our conference brochure 
(w/ corrected titles & firm names).

If you have any questions please contact either me or my assistant, Patricia 
Young 202-508-5757, pyoung@eei.org

Attached is FERC authorization for EPMI and EES to purchase power from 
industrials NATIONWIDE (effective March 6, 2001--Does not expire).  The 
industrial does not have to obtain its own power marketer license from FERC 
(subject to EPMI and EES making certain after the fact quarterlty filings for 
the industrials). 

Specifics:

Owners of generating facilities located at business locations and used 
primarily for back-up for self-generation (who will be "public utilities" 
subject to the Federal Power Act only while they sell at wholesale) can sell 
power at wholesale from such facilities to EPMI and EES without prior notice 
under section 205 of FPA (would usually require 60 day advance notice 
filing).  
  -- Waives certain parts of the filing requirements for the industrial; 
however, the industrial will still be subject to shortened filing 
requirements for dispositions of facilities and interlocking positions while 
they are selling at wholesale.
 -- EPMI and EES will make the FERC quarterly filings on behalf of the 
industrials for any of these purchases.  Our report must show the names of 
the industrial; aggregate amount of capacity and/or energy purchased from 
each seller; and the aggregate compensation paid to each seller.  
Accounting/commercial folks for EPMI and EES-- please make sure these 
purchases are flagged in the accounting system, since the report will be 
separate from our big quarterly reports.
 -- This does not authorize the retail industrial customer to violate any 
rules or tariffs of its host utility.  This does not authorize an industrial 
to resell power it purchases (only can sell what it generates); unless 
otherwise allowed (or not precluded) by its retail tariff.

West Desk:  This is similar to the authorization that FERC gave last week to 
purchases from industrials in WSCC.


____________________________________
On April 27, FERC issued an order granting EPMI and EES the authority to 
purchase power from IPPs at market-based rates.  As the attached order 
indicates, the effective date of the EPMI and EES rate schedules is March 6, 
2001.

I have been asked by numerous parties to put together a rough outline for 
items which require consideration in connection with Unit Contingent PPA's 
(as opposed to the typical commodity form of PPA).  Attached is a quick cut 
that I threw together.  Please take a look and provide me with any 
coments/suggestions that you might have to enhance this document.  Thanks in

As you know, Enron does not own transmission facilities and therefore is not 
subject to the FERC code of conduct rules with respect to functional 
separation of generation and transmission.

However, when Enron established 3 control areas in the SERC region in 
June-July 1999, a separate legal entity (Enron SE Corp) was created to 
provide the reliability/control area operation function for Enron's Southeast 
generation assets.  Although functional separation is not required by FERC, 
Enron chose to do so because marketing/trading is indeed separate from the 
control area reliability function at Enron.  Additionally, Enron SE Corp. (as 
a certified control area) is entitled to ISN and IDC data that is subject to 
NERC confidentiality provisions and cannot be disclosed and/or utilized by 
the merchant function.

In order to protect the IDC and ISN information consistent with the NERC 
Confidentiality Agreement (for ISN data) and the OATI/NERC Non-Disclosure 
Agreement (for IDC data), only employees within the control area reliability 
function have access to the data.   To highlight the importance of this 
confidential information, verbal and written correspondence has been provided 
by Enron's legal and regulatory counsel to each control area employee with 
specific instructions to keep all required information confidential as set 
forth in the NERC Confidentiality Agreement.

I hope this adequately answers your question.  If you have any additional 
questions, please feel free to call me at 713-853-5035.

Thanks,
Kevin Presto

Tom,

 Please e-mail to me a copy of the presentation you gave to the ECAR
Executive Board last Thursday regarding Enron's request for a new control
area. I attended the meeting but the presentation was not part of the agenda
package.
 During your presentation you mentioned that Enron has agreed to
separate their marketing function from their control area function. Can you
please provide a brief explanation on what this means and how Enron plans to
accomplish this?

I believe that most parties in the industry will feel that the EEI Master
Power Purchase and Sale Agreement (Agreement)is fair, and will adopt it with
few changes, if any.  The most daunting task for parties will be to go
through the administrative process of entering into the contract with other
parties with whom they currently have bilaterals in place with.  The cover
sheet provided in the Agreement will make this task easier.

My idea was to have a database on your web site where individual parties
could fill in the required information and their choices presented in the
Cover Sheet.  Then, if we wanted to do a transaction with another party who
has provided the information to the database, we would simply pull up the
information relating to them that they input, and compare the options they
chose versus the options we chose.  If we chose the same options, we would
merely complete the transaction agreement.  If they made certain choices
that were different than ours, we would contact them and work it out and
list the controlling option in the transaction agreement.  This would
streamline the process and get people past the inertia they might feel with
the contract administration surrounding the switch to the Agreement.

I will be out tomorrow, but will be back in the office Monday if you wish to
discuss this.

The latest version of the EEI-NEM Master Contract now can be downloaded from 
EEI's website at  http://www.eei.org/issues/contract/.  We only ask that a 
short registration form be filled out first so that we can better serve the 
community interested in using the contract.  We are making the contract 
freely available, multiple copies may be made, our only restriction is that 
the contract not be resold.  We also request that attribution to EEI and NEM 
be given in all copies of the contract.

Our intention is to use the EEI website and listserver as tools to help 
promote dissemination and use of the contract.  For instance, we could make a 
listing of companies using the contract on the website.  Also, we are 
considering posting on a periodic basis responses to requests for 
clarification or interpretation of the contract terms that would be of 
interest to the user community.  Please let me know if there are other 
enhancements that you would find helpful

As discussed at the 1/26 Working Group meeting, I am circulating minutes of 
the meeting we had with the FERC staff regarding tariff/filing/reporting  
issues related to the Master Contract.  In sum, the meeting was very 
successful in that the staff does not expect their requirements to impose a 
burden on the utilization of the Standard Contract.  If you have further 
questions, please feel free to contact me.

		 Subject: Cal PX indmentity agreement

The CalPX "Credit Redisign" situation is an irritating mess that I am trying 
to help straighten out.  Here is a summary of what is going on.  Please keep 
this summary around and read it every time you get a question from a confused 
individual  and feel free to forward it to whomever out there is confused 
about things.

The CalPX  has a Surety bond with a big Surety entity.  The gist of the thing 
is that If the PX ever gets into a situation where one of the players on its 
exchange defaults, it can pick up the phone and call the  Surety and the 
Surety will rush money to the PX withing 5 minutes, no questions asked.   
Before the Surety agreed to do this bond with the PX they insisted that all 
of the players that do business with the PX (called principals) sign 
indemnity agreements with it.  The indemnity agreements basically say that if 
the Surety ever has to pay a penny to the PX,, it can immediately call the 
Principal and the principal will rush a penny to the Surety within 5.1 
minutes.  The indemnity agreement says that the Principal must pay the Surety 
upon demand for the share of the loss that it caused.  It also says a bunch 
of stuff that makes it very clear that we might also have to pay money in 
situations that are not our fault too.  It is a risky, bad agreement to sign 
and in the first round of this stuff with the PX a year or so ago we did not 
sign any indemnity agreement.  What happened instead was that Enron Corp 
stepped in and saved the day.  It just so happens that Enron Corp. already 
had a preexisting Indemnity Agreement with the Surety covering various 
exposures at the 20,000 foot corporate level.  I was able to get the Enron 
Corp bond people to talk to the Surety and the result was a two sentence 
letter from the PX saying we were okay to trade.  We did not have to sign the 
indemnity agreement.  I did not negotiate any of the terms  between Corp and 
the PX on this. 

That is the history.  Now we come to the PX's new "Credit Redisign."   The PX 
is anxious that it is not covered well enough.  So, out they come with 
exactly the same set of documents demanding that everybody sign another 
indemnity agreement.  Like a trained dog, I have just been trying to do the 
same thing I did last time.  I have called Corp and tried to get them to make 
the issue go away the same way they did last time.  Unfortunately there are 
different people involved now and I have not been very aggressive about 
telling the story and getting eveybody to work together.  I am now back from 
a nice littel vacation and promise to push the thing through Corp. as best I 
can.  I have already left two voice mails and will faithfully and doggedly 
try to take care of this.  ----cgy

Hi Everyone:

    It was brought to my attention by more than one eagle-eye that there was
a typo in section 13.1 of the Enabling Agreement.  The PUCT substantive rule
was 25 not 26.  Attached is the corrected document.  The admin office has
this corrected version as well.

    Sorry for any problems.

In order to standardize confidentiality agreements within the Power Group, at 
Elizabeth's request, please use the following forms.

1.  Unilateral Confidentiality Agreement - Counterparty Protected. (Form 
location:  Power Forms Database)  (To be used prior to commencing a trading 
relationship when EPMI needs to evaluate the prospective CP's financial, load 
or other similar information.  Thereafter, the confidentiality provisions in 
the Master and, if applicable,  the Confirmation, should protect 
Transaction-specific data. )

2.  Unilateral Confidentiality Agreement - Enron Protected.  (Form location:  
Attorney Forms Database, Document No. 1100.2).  (To be used when only EPMI is 
supplying confidential information.  Note:  This is the standard Finance 
Group Form and needs to be tailored first, i.e. by changing the Enron 
entity's name to "EPMI", by defining the "Transaction", etc...)

3.  Bilateral Confidentiality Agreement.  (Form Location:  Attorney Forms 
Database, Document No. 1100.3) (To be used when  two-way confidentiality 
protection is required.  Again note that because this is a standard Finance 
Group Form, it must be similarly tailored.  It also contains an optional 
Chinese Wall provision.)

If you have any questions, please feel free to call me at x57400.

Elizabeth:

We followed up on our discussions last week regarding the consequences of a 
possible bankruptcy of a municipal counterparty and our ability to terminate 
and liquidate our positions in such event, without regard to the generally 
applicable automatic stay.  Attached is a brief memo discussing this issue.  
The principal points to note are as follows:

(1) Municipalities, if they were to file for bankruptcy, do so under Chapter 
9 of the Bankruptcy Code ("BC")--e.g., Orange County, CA.

(2) The "forward contract" exception to the automatic stay found in Sec. 556 
of the BC presently is not explicitly made applicable to filings pursuant to 
Chapter 9.  As you recall, Sec. 556 allows termination of a forward contract 
because of the commencement of a bankruptcy case notwithstanding the general 
prohibition for termination of executory contracts for such grounds in Sec. 
365.  This appears to have been an oversight when Sec. 556 was added to the 
BC in 1982 (according to the National Bankruptcy Review Commission) and 
probably has not been a "high on the agenda item" to correct due to the fact 
that Chapter 9 bankruptcies are relatively rare.

(3) It appears that the other amendments to the BC dealing with forward 
contracts are applicable to Chapter 9, such as Sec. 362 (b) (6) which allows 
the non-defaulting party to setoff or settle without regards to the stay if 
there is an existing default other than an insolvency event.  Also note that 
Colliers on Bankruptcy, the "Bible" in this area, suggests that one can 
nonetheless make the argument that the forward contract exception can be read 
to apply to Chapter 9 filings under present law (see also the discussion at 
(6) below)--although it is uncertain whether a bankruptcy court would accept 
this argument to effectively write something into the statute.

(4) There currently is pending legislation that has been passed by both the 
House and the Senate (and is now the subject of a joint House/Senate 
Conference Committee) that would make it clear that the forward contract 
exception to the automatic stay shall apply to Chapter 9 bankruptcies.  
Adding Sec. 556 to Sec. 901 (the section delineating which sections are 
applicable to Chapter 9 bankruptcies) is not controversial and should survive 
the joint conference committee since similar provisions exist in both the 
House and Senate bills. These provisions are part of the overall legislation 
making fundamental changes in the BC (that has received a lot of press and 
which is controversial in terms of how it treats individual consumers filing 
for bankruptcy).  Our sense, however, is that the bill will be passed and 
signed by President Bush.

(5) Assuming the amendments to Chapter 9 filings are enacted, under the 
existing bills they would first become effective for bankruptcy cases filed 
after 180 days after the legislation is signed by the President.  Thus, to 
the extent that ENA has existing contracts with municipalities, ENA would be 
permitted to exercise its termination and liquidation rights thereunder 
without regard to the automatic stay as long as the municipal counter party 
does not file within 6 months after the date the legislation is signed.

(6) It is worth noting that the legislative committee reports describing the 
changes provide that Congress is "clarifying" that the forward contract 
provisions of the BC apply to municipal bankruptcies, noting that these 
provisions "by their terms are intended to apply to all proceedings under 
Title 11" (which includes Chapter 9 proceedings).  The Senate Report  goes on 
to say that:  "Although sections...556...provide that they apply in any 
proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code, this subsection makes a technical 
amendment in chapter 9 to clarify the applicability of these provisions."  
(Emphasis added).  Thus, this committee language would appear to support an 
argument that Sec. 556 applies to Chapter 9 bankruptcies under Congress's 
interpretation of existing law--obviously, the hoped for result from ENA's 
standpoint.

(7) For your information, when Orange County, CA, filed for bankruptcy the 
County filed under Chapter 9.  The investment pool that held the derivatives 
and other financial contracts initially also made a separate filing under 
Chapter 9. This filing was dismissed, essentially on the basis the investment 
pool was not eligible for relief under Chapter 9 because it did not qualify 
as a "municipality" and it had not been specifically authorized to file under 
Chapter 9.  The dealers and brokerage houses terminated and liquidated their 
positions shortly after the initial filing, based on their belief that the 
investment pool's use of Chapter 9 was improper.  Their terminations and 
liquidations were not undone.

(8) Lastly, as mentioned above, you should note that even if Sec. 556 is not 
applicable to Chapter 9 filings under existing law, if ENA terminated a power 
contract with a municipality prior to the filing date for a reason other than 
the act of filing a bankruptcy petition (e.g., a bond downgrade; failure to 
post collateral; a cross default; the existence of a condition where the 
counterparty is "unable to pay its debts as they come due," etc.), ENA would 
be permitted to proceed with the liquidation of its position (and it could 
exercise any set off or settlement rights) without regard to the automatic 
stay.

Hopefully, the pending legislation will be passed and the concern as to the 
applicability of Sec. 556 to municipalities will be completely eliminated 
within a relatively short period of time.  In the interim, particularly 
during the upcoming summer (when prices in many locations will be highly 
volatile and certain parties' credit positions could fluctuate rapidly and 
materially in some cases, particularly if they are filling open positions in 
the spot market), it may make sense to alert our credit group to be 
particularly vigilant in their monitoring of the ongoing financial condition 
of our municipal counterparties so that we preserve as much flexibility as 
possible with respect to exercising our termination rights under the 
contracts on account of defaults other than the filing of a bankruptcy 
petition by or against our counterparty.

Please give me (or Carl, 303 291-2630, or Jim, 303 291-2632) a call if you 
want to follow up on any of this.

Thanks.

John

Alan:

I will put on the fax to you shortly two memoranda relating to the foregoing; 
one that discusses the general agency law that may be applicable to 
transactions executed by the Service Companies and a second one that gives 
some background to the reasons and underlying authority for the use of such 
companies in a Registered Holding Company system corporate structure.  The 
second memo includes a form of "checklist" that you may want to employ in 
negotiating and documenting ECT's power and fuel contracts with these 
entities.  Also included with the fax is a form of Services Agreement for New 
Century Energies, a registered holding company, since the memo refers via 
example to some of the provisions in that agreement.

Please give me a call if you have any questions or want any further follow up.

John

Dear Elizabeth:

Here are several sections of the current protocols.   These are from the ones 
filed Jan 5, 2001 and from what i understand are the ones that were adopted 
by the PUCT.   You may want to verify that with Jean Ryall

Section 16.2.5 is the credit section.  I will send you the other information 
soon.  This is just to start you off.

Regards,

Smith Day

We had a little Excel disaster this afternoon adding fields for ENA, so if 
it's okay I'd like to deliver the environmental documents first thing Tuesday 
morning.  Unfortunately, Stacey is gone for the afternoon on personal matters 
and I am leaving for a doctors appt as well otherwise we'd send them today.  
You will have the map and the RPS and Disclosure standards and the New 
England model rule first thing in the morning.
