FYI - See Ed's comments.  We helped ENA significantly in getting this "Favor" 
from our friends at PSE&G and it is a good feeling to see that they 
recognized it.

Attached please find the long awaited, much anticipated Garden State 
Paper/Public Service Electric & Gas amendment which will do the following for 
GSP:
1)  Secure TETCO M3 receipt through 10/31/2007
2)  Secure the current discounted LDC transportation rate through 10/31/07
I have reviewed the document and it seems in good order.  This agreement does 
hedge GSP against increases in the base transportation rate on the LDC and 
insures that GSP will have TETCO M3 (as opposed to the currently higher 
Transco Z6 NY) as its receipt point, but it does NOT hedge GSP's M3 basis 
exposure.  That exposure can be hedged through ENA or other wholesale gas 
trading companies.  

Please review it and execute two (2) copies soon as possible.  Thereafter, 
please mail them to the attention of:
Mr. David W. Wohlfarth
Public Service Electric and Gas Company
80 Park Plaza
Newark, New Jersey  07101
(phone) 973-430-5674

Credit for securing this amendment should go to Steve Montovano, VP Gov/Reg 
Affairs.  He was very instrumental in getting PSEG to give GSP this amendment.

If you have any questions, please ask.
Regards,
Ed

Just a note to let you know EECC successfully closed on our sale of ECH 
Offshore shares to Horizon Offshore today and were fully paid our outstanding 
loans, interest, and equity forecasted.  This enables us to exit from the 
pipeline projects on EPC 63 and 64 as planned.  Only CIGSA projects to wrap 
up now.

Thanks again for your assistance in this matter.

A bill introduced in Ohio would have required Enron to become certified and 
pay the OCC and PUCO assessments.  Other provisions called for allowing the 
LDC to tack on a surcharge to recover from all customers the additional costs 
incurred as a result of a defaulting supplier.  Further provisions allow for 
a municipal aggregation pilot with the authority granted to the PUCO to allow 
the program to be expanded to all municipalities at the end of three years.  
At that point, the utilities could seek stranded costs, however it is 
questionable how much they would actually have.

Fortunately, we were able to get an amendment that limited the applicability 
of all these regulations and costs (assessments, surcharges and stranded 
costs) to just the "choice" customers.  Choice customers are primarily 
residential customers operating under the PUCO approved programs established 
in the Columbia, East Ohio and Cinergy service territories.  The threshold 
for regulation, etc is to exempt a mercantile customer who is defined as " a 
customer that consumes, other than for residential use, more than five 
hundred thousand cubic feet of natural gas per year at a single location 
within this state or is part of an undertaking having more than three 
locations within or outside this state."  This should cover most, if not all 
our customers.

The status of the bill is that it has passed committee and the Speaker is 
going to pass it out of the House without amendment.  We are hearing that the 
Senate will accept no amendments either, however, that remains to be seen.  
Barbara and I are monitoring this closely and will keep you posted.

Regulators in Washington State Approve
Accord to Trim Companies' Power Costs
By ROBERT GAVIN
Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL


OLYMPIA, Wash. -- Washington state regulators Thursday approved a settlement
between the state's biggest utility and some of the largest industrial users
that aims to lower the companies' soaring electricity costs.

The settlement brings to an end a bitter dispute between some large
industrial concerns, including Seattle-based Boeing Co. and Puget Sound
Energy of Bellevue over a pricing structure that tied electricity sales to
volatile spot markets, where prices have soared to levels 10 or more times
as high as year-ago prices. Recent spot-market prices have ranged between
$200 and $350 a megawatt hour.

The settlement, in effect, introduces retail electricity competition in a
state that has yet to deregulate its power markets.

The Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission, which announced the
settlement, had ordered hearings in January to develop price controls after
a dozen companies filed complaints alleging they were being overcharged by
Puget Sound Energy. The hearings were delayed while the parties negotiated
the settlement.

Under the settlement, the six biggest customers will be able to buy power
from any source, including other utilities, power marketers and even each
other. Puget Sound Energy will provide the transmission at regulated rates,
which include the cost of transmission and a profit. This arrangement will
allow the customers to lower costs because they will be able to enter
longer-term contracts, typically 60 to 90 days, at prices that are lower
than those of the spot market, which reflects the most expensive prices.

In addition to Boeing, those customers include Georgia-Pacific Corp. of
Atlanta, which operates a plant in Bellingham, and Equilon Enterprises LLC
of Houston, which operates refineries near Anacortes.

"This gives us the flexibility to structure our own transactions and
purchase power at prices [at which] they can afford to stay in business,"
says Melinda Davison, a lawyer who represented most of the companies in the
case.

Puget Sound Energy officials weren't available for comment.

Part of the settlement is similar to Oregon's electricity-deregulation plan
for big commercial customers, scheduled to take effect in the fall. Cass
Bielski, a regulatory analyst at Edison Electric Institute, a Washington,
D.C., industry group, called the settlement "cutting-edge news in the
industry" and "unusual in a state that has not adopted electric retail
choice" as a policy.

Under the settlement, four smaller users -- including Intel Corp. of Santa
Clara, Calif., which operates a plant near Tacoma -- were given the option
of seeking alternative electricity providers or buying power from Puget
Sound Energy at rates capped at either $225 per megawatt hour or $100 less
than the spot price on a major Northwestern U.S. spot-price market. Two even
smaller users will simply buy their power at regulated rates.

Puget Sound Energy also agreed not to recover any revenue lost because of
the settlement from other residential and commercial ratepayers.

Colleagues:

I am seeking your help to compile the accomplishment for GA during the period 
Nov 2000 - April 2001.  Of course, these accomplishments are the summation of 
your efforts either individually or through your group, and the total shall 
indicate the contribution of GA to the corporate objectives of Enron.  The 
aggregation of your inputs shall be one of the primary sources that Rick and 
Steve will use in communicating GA impact to all stakeholders in the 
company.  

I would like to suggest to use the attached excel file to document your 
accomplishment for the period.  I hope that it shall assist you to identify 
your contribution, your estimate of value, and a line, or two, explaining the 
methodology you used to arrive at your value.    

I hope to receive your inputs by  May 16th (next Wednesday), so that I can 
compile the inputs and issue the first draft for discussion by Monday 21st.

Of course, please let me know if you have any question.

Amr

I attach a note I wrote for the head of Continental Trading that lays out the 
work that I -  
with support from the origination and regulatory collegeauges- have been 
engaged in. It is reasonably current. 
The examples of transaction support that have resulted in $$, are from the 
second half of 2000. The first six months
of this year have been focussed on advocacy work related to the revision of 
the German energy
law, negotiating a network agreement for gas, supporting EU investigations in 
abusive practices
and building up stronger political relationships through our trade 
association - EFET. 

The deal support efforts from this year thus far relate to:

Significant support provided to the German origination team to secure 
transport across Germany,
Switzerland, and Italy to provide gas to our first Italian customers. My work 
was focussed on 
getting the Swiss gas company to the negotiating table (something they were 
very reluctant to do) through
regulatory/legal pressures. Currently doing the same to secure TPA  to the 
Trans Austria gas pipeline and
the Baltic Cable - again employing our now well-established regulatory and 
legal pressures (bad cop tactics)
Gas pipeline access in Austria will allow us to significantly increase volume 
supplied to our Italian customers
Baltic access will allow us to begin actively arbitraging power price 
differentials between Germany and
Nordpool. Each of these will be firsts for newcomers in the European market. 

I hope this helps, Paul

Rick - Here is a final copy of the NJN LOI  that was executed ie fuel cells.  
I'm excited about this because although NJN is a smaller LDC , this deal was 
cut at the highest levels (Pres/CFO) of their organization and has solidified 
an already solid regulatory relationship.  Larry Downes has all but assured 
me that  the gas asset deal is next!   Hope all is well.  See u Thursday.

Colleagues:
I hope that a short note on methodology on accomplishments' valuation will be 
of help to all of us at this stage.  Up to this moment, the current criteria 
is still the same established by Jim, John, and Gia Team in the last two 
years.  Its purpose was, and still, is to ensure that Public Affairs 
continues to generate more value than actual expense.    The process, 
hopefully, should drive GA staff to view themselves as "originators" creating 
bottom-line value through (as an example):
revenue enhancement (new opportunity, market expansion)
cost reduction (e.g., fee delay, rate decrease).

The value calculation process focused on the following rules (called SCORE):
Simplicity
Consistency
Objectivity
Reasonableness
Equity

Perhaps it is helpful  to list some of the methodologies submitted so far.  
With no specific preference, they are: 
 A percentage of Enron's business on a specific hub, or transmission 
connection (the percentage is subjectively determined)
 Impact of a specific deal on Enron's stock price (in total or part, again, 
subjectively determined)
 The result of what-if analysis to estimate the would be cost had the 
legislation passed (or did not pass), or a settlement reached (or not reached)
The amount of financing needs that was secured for a deal
NPV of a project.  An extension would be the size of market identified or 
deals originated.
The market size that Enron is targeting.
Value at risk in a specific project or activity
The methodology adopted by the relevant regulatory regimen to calculated  
specific cost item that have been deferred, reduced, or avoided.  An 
extension would be the impact of tariffs determination after intervention (in 
part or total).
The buy/sell spread of a portion of the market size that was released after 
intervention.

I shall keep you posted with any change--in any case, it  shall not happen 
without full consultation with you--meanwhile, please let me know if you have 
any question in this regard.

Below is a concept to perhaps solve the problem confronting EES and the Ohio 
market.  It is a work in progress so suggestions and troubleshooting are 
welcomed.

Problem - There is uncertainty about EES's ability to pursue what had been 
perceived as value propositions in the Columbus Southern Power (AEP) and 
Cinergy markets because of changes in our price curves.  These changes 
reflect the difficulty of offering a physical product due to concerns 
regarding load following and imbalances.

Proposed Solution - Negotiate a power swap with AEP and/or Cinergy.

How the Proposal Works - Under the proposal,  EESI would enter into a 
contract with the customer to deliver power below the shopping credit, 
thereby offering savings to the customer.  EESI would then enter into a 
contract with AEP to provide the power including load following as it 
currently does (similar to the market support generation concept).  EESI 
could agree to pay AEP a modest sum (a few mils/kwh, for example) as an 
incentive to do the deal.   EESI would also enter into a contract with ENA to 
procure on- peak and off- peak replacement power for AEP at a cost equal to 
or less than the price EESI is charging to its customer, minus a percentage 
or millage which would be EESI's profit on the deal.  ENA would contract with 
AEP to provide the on-peak and off-peak power in the same quantities as AEP 
is providing to EESI  customers.

The term of the deal would be a maximum of five years of until the RTO 
adequately addresses load following, whichever comes first. The amount of the 
capacity swap could be limited to either a certain megawatt amount or be up 
to the amound required to get AEP to its 20%.   

Why AEP Might Consider the Deal - Currently, there is no customer switching 
in the AEP service territory.  Under SB 3, if less than 20% of the customers 
switch by the end of 2003, then the Commission must initiate a proceeding to 
address why.  The expected outcome would be to raise the shopping credit, 
which probably would not be an outcome AEP would seek.  If no switching 
continues to be the issue, the Commission could take action sooner.  Also, 
under SB 3, if 20% of customers switch, anytime after mid-2003, any party, 
including the utility, can petition the Commission to go to market based 
rates and end the market development (transition) period.  It is my belief 
that AEP will want to end the market development period as quickly as 
possible for two reasons.  First, they have very little stranded generation 
assets and will have probably recovered them by some time in 2003.  Their 
Regulatory Asset Charge (which is where all there stranded costs really are) 
is a surcharge that they will be allowed to recover irrespective of when the 
Market Development Period ends.  The most compelling reason for AEP to 
consider this proposal is that market prices are high and AEP is unable to 
take advantage of market conditions to the degree that they would probably 
like because their resources are dedicated to providing default power at low 
rates.  This proposal would give them a mechanism to free up generation to 
sell in the competitive market and earn a higher return.  Finally, the swap 
leaves AEP somewhat indifferent and the millage adder, EESI could add to the 
deal is just extra profit for them.

Benefits to EESI - EESI gets to do its deals, make a profit and get a strong 
foothold in the Ohio market.  EESI also gets a competitive edge over other 
marketers by securing physical capability.  Third, by moving AEP more quickly 
to market- based rates, this adds uncertainty in the market which Enron 
thrives on.  Fourth, once AEP goes to market-based rates they are required to 
conduct a competitive bid for default service.  This could potentially 
accelerate by as much as two and  a half years, the opportuntity for an EESI 
play as the default service provider.

Benefit to ENA - This provides ENA a large, longterm wholesale transaction. 
ENA's profit would be the difference between what EESI pays ENA (as described 
above) and the price at which it procures the power. 

Benefit to Customers - The customers get the benefit of lower rates and 
savings that are measured as the difference between the shopping credit and 
the price negotiated with EESI.  They are indifferent as to the source of the 
power.

Next Steps - Assuming this looks like an idea that can work, I would set up a 
lunch meeting with Rich Munzinski, Senior VP who negotiated the settlements 
to explore this concept with him.  Rich is very practical and very 
bottom-line oriented.  If he thinks this is good for AEP, he might be willing 
to carry the water internally on this.  Judging from several years of 
negotiating with him in Ohio and elsewhere, I think there is a reasonable 
chance he would be receptive.   I could also arrange a similar meeting with 
Jim Gainer, VP, legal counsel for Cinergy in the settlements.  I have a good 
relationship with Jim and find him to be practical and straightforward.  If 
he thinks this has merit, he will take it up with Jim Turner, president of 
Cincinnati Gas and Electric Company, who I also have a good relationship 
with, although not as close.

Please let me know your thoughts and suggestions.
Thank you,
Janine

Last week they made $35,000 total.  They made $20,000 one of the days.  We 
had some problems accessing this transmission and others were getting it 
before us, so we talked about submitting more requests (I anticipated that 
several traders would submit a request at the same time).  In Enron trader 
fashion, they automated the submission, which then created the problem for 
SPP.  Since the problem with SPP is now solved, they told me that they should 
be able to get this transmission most days when ERCOT is a better bid than 
SPP, as well as on days when SPP is better (same process for coming into 
SPP).  They said this will be valuable to them year round on most days.

P.S.  The FERC lawyer that SPP called is Stuart Fischer, who was my major 
Hotline contact for Summer 99.  He gave me some helpful info about what FERC 
had told MAPP with a similar computer problem on MAPP's DC tie line.  Then he 
said that he wants to talk about EPMI's other hotline concerns and problems!

A plug for the desk help!

Yesterday, SPP called FERC because the hourly desk was submitting 150 
requests for the same transmission (within several minutes) over the DC tie 
in order to meet the noon allocation.  I spoke with SPP and FERC and 
compromised in submitting less requests, plus we changed our program to work 
more efficiently.  This change still resulted in the hourly desk winning the 
transmission (worth appr. $20,000 day).

Here is what I have been able to do on the list of accomplishments.  Tim 
Belden said it was impossible to quantify what we had done for the western 
market on a P/L basis for ENA, but that it was very important for creating a 
good market going forward. Nonetheless, he gave me a number (I thought a 
pretty low one)  based on what it would mean for his own P/L. I'm waiting to 
hear something back on one other item from EES.  Basically, most of it is 
pretty impossible to quantify.

We are still working to get CP&L to reduce the interconnection fees by the 
existing plant amount (appr. $1.5 million).  However, I did get CP&L to 
recalculate the monthly O&M/replacement fee from the "state" calculation to 
the "FERC" calculation.  Heather said that this change alone results in a 
$140,000/year savings because the deal model had the higher fees built in.

Mike Roan and I met with Ed Martin, president of Wabash and Don Morton, his 
legal counsel to discuss their support for our RTO position.  (Mike did a 
nice job and I believe they will be supportive).

On the business side, Ed Martin would like to talk to someone from Enron to 
partner with them on a deal.  They have a load management device that can be 
installed in air conditioners (they are meeting with Lenox about this) and 
they need a partner to market it this to utilities as a means of reducing 
peak load and making power available for resale.  The product is geared 
towards the residential , but could be applicable to small, medium commercial 
customers and in some cases (depending on utility tariffs and what is 
available), larger customers.  The other angle would be to market this 
directly to customers, although that does not appear to be their focus.  I 
told Ed I would have someone get back to him.  Please advise if you are 
interested.

Thanks,
Janine

p.s.  You probably know this, but just in case, according to Ed , TVA is 
getting squeezed by Duke and Southern and is quietly lobbying folks like the 
Coops to raise the issue of increasing transmission capacity by building 
additional transmission lines to better inteconnect the system.

I am compiling a "rigorous" and "totally defensible" explanation/Calculation for the values arrived at your accomplishments for 2001 so that Steve can take it to the board this Thursday.  These inputs are required by the end of business day today.  I shall take the liberty to contact you in person to work with you in ensuring the accurate documentation of your calculation.  

Many thanks.

1. Alberta PPA - Transmission Cost Responsibility Hearing 

Enron is leading a coalition of 5 PPA Buyers that successfully advocated the AEUB to convene a process/hearing (the convening of which was opposed by the PPA Owners) to consider the proposal by the Transmission Administrator to apply transmission charges to PPA Buyers for transmission capacity that solely accrues to the financial benefit of PPA Owners.  One week of hearings were held in spring 2001 with the hearing scheduled to be completed in November 2001.  Value to Enron Canada if we prevail at hearing is approximately $Cdn 60 million.

2. Alberta PPA - Alberta Government Agreement to Split Enron's Sundance B PPA in Two PPAs

Government Affairs successfully lobbied Alberta Energy officials and Minister of Energy to agree to approve regulatory changes necessary to allow for the split of Enron's PPA into two PPAs despite one of the fundamental elements of the original PPA model was that the PPAs would be very large and not divisible.  This is important as the whole PPA represents 706 MW and is likely too large for Enron to sell as a whole but a PPA of 303 MW is much more marketable to potential Enron counter parties.  Value to Enron Canada if one-half PPA is sold is projected to be approximately $Cdn 50 million.

3. Alberta PPA - Opposition to Wabamun Water Treatment Plant Expansion 

Government Affairs in conjunction with legal group has achieved "effected person" status in relation to an application by TransAlta (Enron's PPA Owner counterparty) to undertake an expansion to the Wabamun Water Treatment Plant.  The objective is to position Enron to resist future attempts by TransAlta to pass through the cost of this expansion to Enron.  Value to Enron Canada if we succeed is project to be approximately $Cdn 2 million.

4. Alberta - Appointment to Key Government/Industry Committees

Enron Government Affairs staff are presently members of each of the key committees in Alberta responsible for providing advice to Government and/or its appointed agents (Power Pool, TA, AEUB) on electricity market design issues, including: Advisory Committee, Power Pool Operations Committee, AEUB Electric Reliability Task Force, Industry Structure Review Consultant Selection Committee, Retail Issues Committee, IPPSA Board of Directors.  Value to Enron not quantifiable.

5.  Alberta - Enron Direct

Enron Government Affairs provided extensive support to Enron Direct in undertaking media/government launch of Enron Direct in Alberta is presently assisting Enron Direct in determining rules and requirements to expand its service offerings to B.C. natural gas market and AltaGas Utilities service territory in Alberta.  Enron Government affairs is also advocating against discriminatory exit fees proposed by Atco Gas.  Value to Enron not quantifiable.

6. Ontario - Electricity Market Opening - continue to advocate Ontario electricity market opening.


7. Ontario - Enron Direct - support for the establishment of Enron Direct's business in Ontario, including the applicable rules, licensing, and development of business procedures and forms of contract to be used.

Rick - Over the weekend we agreed to terms with PSE&G on a gas case 
requestiung the transfer of pipeline capacity contracts.  In return for our 
support, we obtained the following:
 Two three year gas storage deals with ENA;
 Three year Capacity Management, when Residential customers move to market 
prices, (probably within two-three years);
 5% Basic Generation Service when BGS market opens 8/02.

ENA is currently valueing the gas deals, however, my guess is they are worth 
approximately $3-5 million.  The cap mgt deal will be worth approximately 
$25-30 million, whiule the BGS will be a liitle difficullt to quantify at 
this point.  There was also a general understanding with Steve Teitleman, 
President PSEG Genco, to increase the business between ENA and PS, both in 
power and gas.  

I will forward the LOI when it is signed, probably within a few days.  As 
always please call if you wish to discuss the details.

It looks excellent.   I vote to increase all numbers by 50%!

Joking aside, you have provided REAL educational and strategic value that I cannot put a price on.  The sucess of our standard products owe their winning structure, in large part, to you.  They are the only products/deals we are currently closing, and that says something.  You trained 3 brand new employees (me, Jeff, and Marc) in 6 weeks and prepared us to launch a value proposition that is currently the only value prop that is making $ in Illinois.

Thanks for your patience and continued support.

Subject:	Value of Govt.Aff. Support

Hello All -- It's that time of year again where I am asked to list my accomplishments and provide some sense of whether such efforts were valuable.  Attached is a draft document I have created from a form used in Government Affairs and have provided some valuations in each of the main accomplishment areas.  I have tried to be fair but have undoubtedly provided inaccurate estimates of valuation.  Please take a moment to open the document and provide me with feedback regarding estimating value for services I have provided beginning November 2000 through April 2001.  Again, I do not seek to claim unfair recognition but also my efforts are justified in part by the value I bring to Enron and its business units.  This document will be revised and submitted prior to June 6, so please get back to me at you earliest convenience.  Thank you.

I would like to recommend the attached file as a starting point to add the accomplishments from May 2001 till present.  It is the compilation of GA accomplishment up to end of April 2001.  Brian Gottfredson and I shall compile all your additions in the attached file and arrive at the updated value.  Kindly cc Brian and I in your communication.  

The second step is to go through a tighter edit to arrive at a fully defensible valuation.

Many thanks

The Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit issued a decision today upholding FERC's order requiring MAPP to provide refunds to transmission customers on MAPP's system.  As you may recall, in response to EPMI's 1997 complaint against MAPP regarding the unauthorized assessment of third party compensation charges assessed on import and export transactions, FERC ordered MAPP (and its utility members) to pay refunds to customers.  EPMI's refund, including interest, was $750,000.

The utilities appealed FERC's order, arguing that FERC erred in ordering refunds.  EPMI filed a counter-appeal, arguing that FERC did not go far enough and the refunds should have been greater.  Our primary goal in filing the appeal was to counteract the utilities' argument and give the Court the other side of the story.  

Although the Court did not grant EPMI's appeal, we're very pleased that the Court rejected the utilities' argument to revoke the refunds.   Now, unless the utilities appeal this to the Supreme Court (which is highly unlikely), EPMI's refund will no longer be subject to dispute.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Sarah

		 Subject: Baltimore Gas & Electric v. Enron Federal Solutions

In a 48-page opinion issued on March 12, United States District Court Judge 
Andre Davis granted EFSI's motion for summary judgment and dismissed BG&E's 
lawsuit.  BG&E was seeking a ruling that nonregulated companies should not be 
permitted to provide utilty services to federal armed services bases located 
within state territory.  Along with Friday's dismissal of the Colorado suit 
brought by Colorado State Utilities, this should end this threat to EFSI's 
business.  The only judicial challenge that remains is the lawsuit filed by 
Virginia Power at the Federal Court of Claims, and the issue in that lawsuit 
relates solely to bundling.  Moreover, there is language in Judge Davis' 
decision (on the non-retroactivity of the October Hexley amendments to 
section 2688) that, if followed by the Federal Court of Claims, will be 
dispositive of that issue as well.

The Venable firm, primarily Jim Shea and Mitch Mirviss, did an outstanding 
job briefing and arguing this case.  However, as the Judge noted in his 
decision, had Congress passed the House version of the Hexley amendment, the 
Judge would have been obliged to rule in BG&E's favor.  Cynthia Sandherr and 
Bob Frank are responsible for getting the language changed in conference so 
that it ended up helping, not defeating, our case.

I will let you know if BG&E appeals.

Please call me with any questions.  Thank you.

This transaction was a real pleasure to work on.  It is a 12 month 
all-requirements contract with Central Maine Power Company for their 
medium-sized commercial customers.

Once again the model of a cross-functional team was successfully employed.  
John Llodra was the lead originator with support from George Wood 
(mid-market), Janice Moore (legal) and myself.  The four of us participated 
in numerous meetings with both the counterparty and with the regulatory 
commission overseeing the procurement process with the ultimate result of 
having our contract approved and executed the same day.  I am told the deal 
booked $10m for ENA.

Contratulations on the execution of the Central Maine SOS deal! This is 
another great example of what we can do when everyone comes together to get 
something done. This transaction brings both strategic value to the business, 
nice positions for the book and quite a nice chunk of change as well! 

Great job guys!

Subject: Rehearing on PG&E's GRC


Almost two years after issuing a decision in PG&E's GRC, the Commission
issued it rehearing order on October 16th and, lo and behold, actually
granted TURN's rehearing request in part.  The overall result is to reduce
the capital revenue requirement by $24.8 million and expenses by $37.3
million.  In addition, some portion of PG&E' estimated $171 million in
electric distribution capital spending will be subject to rehearing.
Listed  below are the areas in which the Commission granted rehearing.

1.  Electric Distribution Capital Spending.    The Commission will, in
essence, reopen the record, and allow PG&E to put into evidence how much it
invested in its electric distribution plant in 1998.  PG&E had used a 1998
forecasted amt of capital expenditures to develop its test year forecast.
TURN argued that there was substantial evidence on the record that this
amount was never spent. PG&E argued that the record closed prior to the end
of 1998 so the best it could do was an estimate.  On rehearing, the
Commission agreed with TURN, that there was evidence that the forecasted
amount was never spent, so they are allowing PG&E to prove it.  The
rehearing order states that any rates that are raised based on the electric
distribution capital forecast adopted the GRC decision  may be subject to
refund.

2.  Emergency Response Work This work category under electric distribution
capital spending was reduced by $17.2 million.

3.  Vegetation Management. The Supplemental Tree Trimming Program was
reduced by $9.2 million.

4.  Meter Reading.  PG&E had primarily used accounting changes to justify
the large increase in this service.  On rehearing the Commission stated that
PG&E had failed to substantiate those changes and reduced the allowed amount
by $7.9 million.

5. Account Services.  On rehearing the commission stated that PG&E had
failed to show (a) why it cost so much more to provide services to CIA
customers  than residential customers ( $43.30 vs. $10.20); and (b) that
money was not going for marketing activities that the Commission had
disallowed in the previous GRC.  The result was that the commission
disallowed $20 million.

6.  Customer Information Systems.  The Commission disallowed $7.2 million as
funds which ratepayers had already expended for CIS  rewrites for which they
had not received any benefits.

Some originators today reiterated how valuable Gov't Affairs can be in 
bringing deals (citing Tom Chapman -- Alamac and Dan Allegretti -UI).  The 
new East power services desk (headed by Lloyd Will and Tom May) is taking off 
and very interested in muni, industrial on-site generation purchases, 
scheduling, etc.  Origination (EPMI and EES) are interested in structured 
deals -- all requirements, tolling, etc.  Thanks for keeping this in mind 
while out there in the trenches!

Amr

I attach a note I wrote for the head of Continental Trading that lays out the work that I -  
with support from the origination and regulatory collegeauges- have been engaged in. It is reasonably current. 
The examples of transaction support that have resulted in $$, are from the second half of 2000. The first six months
of this year have been focussed on advocacy work related to the revision of the German energy
law, negotiating a network agreement for gas, supporting EU investigations in abusive practices
and building up stronger political relationships through our trade association - EFET. 

The deal support efforts from this year thus far relate to:

Significant support provided to the German origination team to secure transport across Germany,
Switzerland, and Italy to provide gas to our first Italian customers. My work was focussed on 
getting the Swiss gas company to the negotiating table (something they were very reluctant to do) through
regulatory/legal pressures. Currently doing the same to secure TPA  to the Trans Austria gas pipeline and
the Baltic Cable - again employing our now well-established regulatory and legal pressures (bad cop tactics)
Gas pipeline access in Austria will allow us to significantly increase volume supplied to our Italian customers
Baltic access will allow us to begin actively arbitraging power price differentials between Germany and
Nordpool. Each of these will be firsts for newcomers in the European market. 

I hope this helps, Paul

Attached is the first draft of our intervention in the Georgia Power rate case.
 << File: Georgia Power Case3.doc >> 

Our goals are to get:
Georgia Power's weather risk transferred to the market through purchase of weather hedges, in lieu of GP's proposal to refund a portion of above normal weather revenues in exchange for supposedly bearing downside weather risk (for EGM, principally);
Disclosure of new capacity contracts whose costs are proposed to be recovered through a new automatic capacity recovery mechanism, to help our own ability to hedge existing retail positions (for EWS);
Application of an earnings test that would limit when the capacity cost recovery mechanism goes into place, to help keep down rate increases on our existing retail positions (for EWS);
A reduction in GP's ROE if the automatic capacity recovery mechanism is approved; to limit rate increases on our existing retail positions (for EWS).

Andy and Mark, please give me your suggestions.  I will schedule follow-ups as needed.  Mark, I have talked to Gary Taylor and he is working up some hedge examples that will be very useful.  Also, Bob Frank and I had a very general discussion with Dynegy about our issues.  They have intervened in this case also and may be supportive.  Do you have any objection to sharing our views with them?  They could be very helpful.  

Mike, I think this is the first rate case where Enron is intervening in a closed state (Georgia).  It's certainly likely other parties will want to know our interests.  Most of the retail position is from Springs, Owens Corning, Quebecor, Rich, and Simon.  Another half-dozen contracts also have positions there.  I want to make sure you have no objection to Enron's participation.  Any suggestion on how best to characterize our interest would be great.

We have four weeks before this must be finalized so there is time.  But hearings start next week for GP's witnesses so any immediate feedback in terms of direction, etc. would be great.

Thank you.

Rick - FYI - I was responsible for bring this company to David Cox and 
setting up the meeting referenced in the proposal attached.  At that meeting 
Cox basically offered UT&S a 10% commission if they could bring a cutomer to 
EBS.  Based on conversations that I have had with John DiDario, he has 
several customers to bring.  Revenues on 1 customer, on a 5 year deal exceeds 
$150 million.  I am concerned about feedback that I am getting about our 
"network".  I will discuss with you when I get back from vacation.
 On a related note, I am in the process of setting up a meeting between EBS 
and Global One (France Telecom).  GLobal One has indicated that they are 
interested in "all the bandwidth capacity" that we have to offer.  
I hope one or both of these close!

Subject: Update on GridFlorida and TCCs

Steve ,

The following is a quick update on  two important  issues ;

GridFlorida ....As you know from my last update we have a very good "Market 
Representation " on the Advisory Committee and at the first meeting last week 
we formed a Market Design Working Group (MDWG) to work on developing an 
improved Market Design in Florida. I have been voted in as the Chairman of 
the committee and our first order of business will be to improve the 
Congestion Management proposals and to develop a Real Time Energy Spot Market 
with "uncovered" and "unbalanced " schedules  . We now have the right  people 
in place and the real battle now begins .
.

TCCs..............We did very well and continue to grow the  business .The 
results of the winter TCCs season are now tabulated and they are as follows ;



Rev Bids  Nov   Dec  Jan  Feb   Mar  Apr  Total Revenue Winter Period

  337K   483K  932K  311K  552K  695K  928K               $4,238,000

       311K  552K  695K  928K   $2,486,000


We have expanded our portfolio for the upcoming summer period and expect to 
increase our revenues over that period .We are on track to exceed our goal of 
$10 million for calendar 2001.

Subject: Retail Deal with Food Industry Alliance Closed

Last week, an aggregation deal closed with the NY Food Industry Alliance 
(FIA). It will be booked with a margin of at least $1.3 million. I sublet 
office space from the Food Industry Alliance in Albany, and I initated 
discussions between them and EES last Fall. I also worked with both EES and 
the President of the FIA in the final stages to bring the deal to closure and 
resolve a number of issues raised by several of the FIA's members. My 
physical location in the FIA's office suite was actually used by the 
President as a selling point to his members in the face of a slighly less 
expensive offer from a competitor.

FYI - This is something a little different for me.  I discussed these 
opportunities to Duran last month and they appear to have some juice.  Tony 
Ravosa is a contact of mine who has had me in front of Gov Rowland on a 
regular basis, which led to the Conn. sites.  The NY site however is the most 
attractive.  I will keep you posted as to the outcome. Steve

Tony -

Thank you for spending so much time with me the last several days.  Driving 
out to Brookhaven, LI, to meet with Steve and me was really beyond the call 
of duty.  Your efforts there and in Connecticut gave me a very good initial 
idea of the opportunities we may have in these two locations.

My first pass look at the New Britain and Waterbury sites in Connecticut 
suggest that they will certainly be permittable.  The support from the local 
municipalities and the Governor which you described is encouraging.  My next 
step on these sites is to get an indication internally as to how interested 
Enron is, strategically and financially, in Connecticut power.  I know that 
you want a statement of interest fairly quickly from us, so you can offer the 
opportunities to other developers if we decline.

The Brookhaven site on Long Island also looks interesting, and we have 
already stated our interest in New York power.  The good news and the bad 
news of this site is that AEP controls a 20-acre site a half mile away from 
it.  The good part  is that AEP has already initially identified the gas, 
power, and water interconnections for this area, and shown that a power plant 
is environmentally low impact here.  The bad news is that a second plant now 
might exceed LIPA's and the local communities capacity for power.  My next 
steps are to informally identify the transmission constraints.  I have 
already talked to Dan Staines about this, and Monday we tentatively decided 
to seek a meeting with Steve's contact at KeySpan the week of May 16th when 
I'm back in New York.

Finally, we discussed hypothetically what The Vince Group's interest would be 
in these sites, should we decide to pursue any of them.  You would be most 
interested in being retained as the local facilitator for these projects, 
which Steve agrees you are very capable of doing, with a success payment to 
you upon deal closure, to reimburse you for bringing these sites to us.  I 
will investigate internally if this is workable.

Tony, thank you again for your time and interest.  I will get back to you as 
I complete my initial investigations in the next two weeks on these three 
sites.

Rick

The rate case that the governmental affairs group filed in January, on behalf 
of Transredes, has come to a very successful conclusion and the new rates 
will go into effect towards the end of this month.  The rates are not much 
lower than what we filed for, and represent a very significant increase over 
the previous rates.  The tariff methodology and revised regulations, put into 
effect by the Supreme Decree, were followed to the letter by the regulator 
despite political pressure to arbitrarily keep rates down.  The deliverables 
here were to (1) obtain a tariff methodology via Supreme Decree that would 
make the company finance-able / rescue it from dire financial straits and (2) 
file a rate case and prosecute it to obtain hard rates in accordance with the 
tariff methodology.  This second deliverable has now been completed.  
Transredes has had a bond issue pending since last year due to the 
uncertainty about rates; it is my understanding that the financial market 
loved the ruling and that Transredes sold $40 million worth of bonds in about 
5 minutes!  This ruling should also significantly increase Transredes's 
market value, relative to Enron's efforts to sell its interest in the company.

Subject: Tariffs Approved

Gentlemen,

I am delighted to report that SIRESE approved substantial increases in TR's 
tariffs consistent with the Law and Regulation.  The details are :-

     Existing Tariff SIRESE Approved % Increase TR/CLHB Proposed TR/CLHB % 
Increase

Gas Export (including surcharges)  $0.18  $0.2205  22.5%  $0.26 (excluding 
RG)  44.4%
Liquids Domestic    $1.05  $2.46  134.3%  $3.25    209.5%
Liquids Export     $1.55  $2.31  49%  $3.35    116.1%

CLHB's tariffs were also approved as follows $1.19  $2.20  84.9%  $3.528    
196.5%

As you can see we did substantially better than CLHB (comparable with our 
liquids domestic) !!

We will get a detailed report on the assumptions used by SIRESE to reach 
their conclusions on Monday, but our inteligence suggests the following :-

1. Export gas volumes increased to 100% TR capacity, and 100% GSA + Cuiaba 2 
assumed for SDA and TEMIN purposes
2. RG Compresion project deleted
3. Interest rate reduced to 10 or 10.5 % i.e. the rate in our bond issue
4. Liquids expansion in the South reduced
5. Some continuity of service CAPEX reduced
6. Unknown OPEX reduction and maybe a change to the OPEX allocation between 
concesions
7. OCC in service date slipped from 2003 to 2004.
8. Debt/Equity assumption changed from 60/40 to 70/30

Our strategy to respond to each of these points is as follows :-

1. Volumes.  Covered by 8% rule, we can blete but can expect little back 
here.  Clearly we will appeal if volumes exceed installed capacity in the 
short term i.e. 2002/2003.
2. RG Compression - not worth fighting for since we don't even have the 
support of BG
3. Interest Rate - We'll get this back when we do a tariff  revision and 
actual rates are used.  When we get the detail we will appeal if Jan feels we 
have concrete grounds i.e. commision costs etc. are omited.
4. Liquids Expansion in the South.  Here we intend to do a detailed analysis 
of exactly what has been deleted and as a result what liquids/gas production 
will be shut in.  If possible all assumptions to be agreed with the affected 
producers (PB, BG, Vintage and Chaco).  We will then write to those 
producers(copy SIRESE , VMEH etc.) stating that on their recommendation the 
project scope was reduced by SIRESE.  We will give them an estimate of the 
lost liquids/gas production (in both volume and cash terms) resultant from 
this decision.  We will tell them that since they proposed these reductions 
we have no intention of appealing them but invite them to appeal.
5. Continuity of Service Capex.  We need to see the detail here.  We will 
take the moral high ground and be absolutely clear that we are not prepared 
to compromise our safety and environmental standards.  We need to see exactly 
what has been removed, but my thought is that if that means we are unable to 
provide some services (e.g. LPG transportation) or the continued operation of 
some liquids laterals, we should write to those producers affected suggesting 
that if they wish these services to be continued they need to appeal the 
decision.  Again since this is Capex we will get it back in the end on tariff 
revisions as long as the expenditure is approved on an annual basis in the 
SIRESE budget process.
6. OPEX - need to see the detail on Monday.
7. OCC - will not appeal - we need to do a detailed study to develop an OCC 
strategy.
8. Debt/Equity ratio.  Strictly speaking what has been done is in accordance 
with the Law/Regulation - the regulation says the maximum allowed equity is 
40%.  However, we have very strong grounds to appeal since : a) we are 
currently miles away from 60/40 let alone 70/30, b) we can only borrow for 
CAPEX (as per bond issue and the policy of all/most banks/lending 
institutions) with the case presented in the rate case if we borrow to cover 
100% of CAPEX we can easily demonstrate that we are still miles away from 
60/40.  We intend to fight this one very hard using all the 
external/independant help we can get.

As you are all aware our big exposure with the rate case was that the much 
needed substantial increase in liquids tariffs would not be approved and we 
would be subjected to some form of arbitary cut.  This has not happened 
SIRESE has now approved and hence owns these substantial increases.  Having 
got the big hike our job is now to claw back as much as we can from the above 
strategy in the full knowledge that the results of these efforts will be much 
smaller and hence managable increases.

Attached is an analysis of the individual impacts on the tariff of the above 
points and the corporate model using the new tariff with our volume 
assumptions (i.e. the worst case).

Regards,
Doug

This month EES successfully renewed its affinity relationship with the Maine 
Electric Consumers Cooperative.  MECC, you will recall, is the C&I load 
aggregation group put together by Tony Buxton and Rich Silkman.  With the 
establishment of new market-based standard offer prices effective March 1, 
2001 customers in the aggregation group responded very favorably to the 
MECC/EES offers.  More than half of the load opted for five-year deals 
bringing sales to over 3 million mWh.  I am told as of last Friday the 
transactions booked a total aggregate margin of $21 million.

Phyllis Anzalone deserves most of the credit for bringing this one home.  
While I was not always involved in the day-to-day negotiations, I am proud to 
have strongly promoted the relationship with MECC and to have played a hand 
in the Maine Restructuring Law that made this and the ENA transaction 
possible.

My apologies for inadvertently leaving you off the distribution list.  It was 
late when I sent this out...

Additional thoughts that may not have been fully articulated in my first 
email and which Mike Roan and I discussed this morning...

To get CSP up to the 20% mark, we could do a preemptive default service deal, 
whereby we negotiate to take enough of CSP's customers to get them to the 20% 
within a customer class.  The deal could be with commercial or residential 
customers.  I don't think we could do much with industrials because the 
shopping credit is fairly low.  The shopping credits are as follows:

Residential Non-heat - 5.12
Total Residential - 3.94
Commercial - 5.88, 5.79, 4.06, 3.22 for GS-1, GS-2, GS-3, GS-4 respectively.
Industrial -  3.88, 2.01, 2.71

The customer load by class in CSP's service territory for 2001 as estimated 
in AEP's 2000 Longterm Forecast Report is as follows:

Residential - 6,351,000 MWH x 20% = 1,270,000 MWH
Commercial - 6,707,000 MWH x 20% = 1,341,400 MWH
Industrial -        3,241,000 MWH x 20% =    648,000 MWH

The numbers multipled by the 20% switch is the approximation of load that 
would have to switch to an alternative supplier to free-up CSP's generation 
and get it to market based rates.

Please feel free to provide comments and suggestions.
Janine

		 Subject: AEP - Brainstorming

Below is a concept to perhaps solve the problem confronting EES and the Ohio 
market.  It is a work in progress so suggestions and troubleshooting are 
welcomed.

Problem - There is uncertainty about EES's ability to pursue what had been 
perceived as value propositions in the Columbus Southern Power (AEP) and 
Cinergy markets because of changes in our price curves.  These changes 
reflect the difficulty of offering a physical product due to concerns 
regarding load following and imbalances.

Proposed Solution - Negotiate a power swap with AEP and/or Cinergy.

How the Proposal Works - Under the proposal,  EESI would enter into a 
contract with the customer to deliver power below the shopping credit, 
thereby offering savings to the customer.  EESI would then enter into a 
contract with AEP to provide the power including load following as it 
currently does (similar to the market support generation concept).  EESI 
could agree to pay AEP a modest sum (a few mils/kwh, for example) as an 
incentive to do the deal.   EESI would also enter into a contract with ENA to 
procure on- peak and off- peak replacement power for AEP at a cost equal to 
or less than the price EESI is charging to its customer, minus a percentage 
or millage which would be EESI's profit on the deal.  ENA would contract with 
AEP to provide the on-peak and off-peak power in the same quantities as AEP 
is providing to EESI  customers.

The term of the deal would be a maximum of five years of until the RTO 
adequately addresses load following, whichever comes first. The amount of the 
capacity swap could be limited to either a certain megawatt amount or be up 
to the amound required to get AEP to its 20%.   

Why AEP Might Consider the Deal - Currently, there is no customer switching 
in the AEP service territory.  Under SB 3, if less than 20% of the customers 
switch by the end of 2003, then the Commission must initiate a proceeding to 
address why.  The expected outcome would be to raise the shopping credit, 
which probably would not be an outcome AEP would seek.  If no switching 
continues to be the issue, the Commission could take action sooner.  Also, 
under SB 3, if 20% of customers switch, anytime after mid-2003, any party, 
including the utility, can petition the Commission to go to market based 
rates and end the market development (transition) period.  It is my belief 
that AEP will want to end the market development period as quickly as 
possible for two reasons.  First, they have very little stranded generation 
assets and will have probably recovered them by some time in 2003.  Their 
Regulatory Asset Charge (which is where all there stranded costs really are) 
is a surcharge that they will be allowed to recover irrespective of when the 
Market Development Period ends.  The most compelling reason for AEP to 
consider this proposal is that market prices are high and AEP is unable to 
take advantage of market conditions to the degree that they would probably 
like because their resources are dedicated to providing default power at low 
rates.  This proposal would give them a mechanism to free up generation to 
sell in the competitive market and earn a higher return.  Finally, the swap 
leaves AEP somewhat indifferent and the millage adder, EESI could add to the 
deal is just extra profit for them.

Benefits to EESI - EESI gets to do its deals, make a profit and get a strong 
foothold in the Ohio market.  EESI also gets a competitive edge over other 
marketers by securing physical capability.  Third, by moving AEP more quickly 
to market- based rates, this adds uncertainty in the market which Enron 
thrives on.  Fourth, once AEP goes to market-based rates they are required to 
conduct a competitive bid for default service.  This could potentially 
accelerate by as much as two and  a half years, the opportuntity for an EESI 
play as the default service provider.

Benefit to ENA - This provides ENA a large, longterm wholesale transaction. 
ENA's profit would be the difference between what EESI pays ENA (as described 
above) and the price at which it procures the power. 

Benefit to Customers - The customers get the benefit of lower rates and 
savings that are measured as the difference between the shopping credit and 
the price negotiated with EESI.  They are indifferent as to the source of the 
power.

Next Steps - Assuming this looks like an idea that can work, I would set up a 
lunch meeting with Rich Munzinski, Senior VP who negotiated the settlements 
to explore this concept with him.  Rich is very practical and very 
bottom-line oriented.  If he thinks this is good for AEP, he might be willing 
to carry the water internally on this.  Judging from several years of 
negotiating with him in Ohio and elsewhere, I think there is a reasonable 
chance he would be receptive.   I could also arrange a similar meeting with 
Jim Gainer, VP, legal counsel for Cinergy in the settlements.  I have a good 
relationship with Jim and find him to be practical and straightforward.  If 
he thinks this has merit, he will take it up with Jim Turner, president of 
Cincinnati Gas and Electric Company, who I also have a good relationship 
with, although not as close.

Please let me know your thoughts and suggestions.
Thank you,
Janine

Jim, I think that's a great idea.  Let me know available times so that I can 
set up a call.

Janine --

The point about load balancing and following is critical.  EES is struggling 
to compete with a physical product in ILL.

I know that Don Black and Jay Lewis are trying to figure out what are the 
critical components of the real-time balancing rules.

Maybe we should try and set up a phone call between Govt Affairs and EES Risk 
Mgmt to define the necessary rules and see how (a) a ComEd / ICC Settlement 
would work and (b) what are the implications of the Order 2000 RTO process in 
the Midwest (MISO and ARTO).

Thanks,

Jim

Subject: Com Ed

Last week, Sue and I, along with Phil O'Connor of New Energy met with Frank 
Clark ( Senior V.P. Exelon - Government Affairs, etc) and Arlene Juracek 
(V.P. Rates and Tariffs).  Sue and I also met with Commissioners Hurley and 
Harvill.

Information Gleaned From the Meeting:

1.  Com Ed does not think price volatility will be acceptable to the 
residential customers and wants to create a structured rate.  They are not 
open to any alternative that causes them to lose money.
2.  They will file a rate case in 2004 to be effective in 2005.  They are not 
sure the statute requires them to file an MVI plus 10% at the end of the PPO 
period and need to study the statutory requirements.  Their preference is to 
initiate performanced based ratemaking instead for bundled rates.
3.  Com Ed's view is that the energy situation is a  national problem.  Com 
Ed wants to be protected through its commodity price.
4.  Com Ed does not want the obligation to serve industrial customers and on 
a longer term basis, would like to shed its obligation to serve residential.
5.  Com Ed has arbitrarily defined mass market as 400kw or less and has 
therefore lumped these commercial customers in with their residential, 
however, they are open to separating them out.
6.  Com Ed does not want the legislation reopened which may provide us with 
some leverage.

At the conclusion of the meeting it was decided to start an open forum 
process to get ideas on the table.  Com Ed is shying away from any formal 
process.  Their concern seems to be that they do not want to take the 
political heat for high prices and volatility and would rather give up its 
default customer service obligations.

Possible Deal Opportunities:

1.  Either through negotiations (preferred choice) or through competitive 
bidding, become the default service provider for some or all of Com Ed's 
industrial customers.  This would allow us to upsell additional products to 
the industrial class.
2.  Segregate the commercial customers (100 - 400 Kw) customers from the 
residential customers and negotiate to become the default service provider.
3.  Joint venture between ENA and New Power to be the default service 
provider for portions of the residential class through an opt-out program 
like municipal aggregation or some other format.

Next Steps:

1.  Mark Ulrich is to complete an analysis of the Com Ed proposal in terms of 
its impact on our current book of business
2.   Develop a position boiled down to just a few key points that we can push 
with regulators and Com Ed.  In a conference call with Harry, Mark, Roy, Sue 
and me, we have tentatively distilled the list to the following:
 a.  Default deal for industrial customers
 b.  Negotiate for Com Ed to provide load following and balancing
 c.  Default deal for commercial as opposed to PBR
