Would consider it if the Republicans were not so wrong on the social issues I 
care about (personally).

The DNC is on its way to causing irreparable harm with the energy industry.  
I think they have grossly over estimated the political gain in slamming the 
oil and gas industry.  We will see.

I think Steve's meeting with Rep. Adam Smith and your meeting with the DLC 
are evident in the New Dem approach.   They are only my last hope.

Please see the attached New Democrat Coalition Energy Policy outline.  While 
not a comprehensive document, it does NOT call for price caps.  The New Dem 
plan does call for the development of national interconnection, as well as a 
creation of an Energy Reliability Organization to help facilitate the role of 
RTOs.  

This is in stark comparison to the DNC and Democratic Policy Committees 
approach.

Midterm Jitters in the House 
By David S. Broder

Wednesday, May 16, 2001; Page A23 
President Bush may not be a scholar, but he is an avid student of politics. 
For understandable reasons, he has given especially close scrutiny to the 
lessons of his father's presidency -- and what went wrong to deny him a 
second term in 1992.
The results can be seen in the current chief executive's adamant support of 
the large tax cut on which he campaigned; he knows that his dad's retreat 
from his "no new taxes" pledge cost him vital conservative support. The 
younger Bush is also the opposite of the elder in emphasizing education. Bush 
I did little or nothing to change the schools; Bush II put them at the top of 
his agenda, just as the voters persistently do.
But the most costly error -- in political terms -- that Bush I made was 
refusing to consider any short-term fixes for the economic slump that began 
in the third year of his presidency. When the jobless rate began to edge up, 
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady counseled Bush against any stimulus 
measures, saying that market forces would be enough by themselves to keep the 
recession short.
Brady's advice brought no comfort to the Republican politicians on Capitol 
Hill, who were picking up bad vibes from their constituents. Vice President 
Dan Quayle, who was on the GOP fundraising circuit in 1991, expressed his 
frustration that Brady was blocking even modest short-term measures. History 
has recorded that Brady was right. The recession was short, and recovery -- 
as measured by the statisticians -- actually began before the 1992 election. 
But that did not spare the incumbent president from charges of indifference 
to persisting unemployment, and Bill Clinton was elected on a promise to pep 
up the economy.
The current Bush has accepted congressional changes in his tax plan that will 
apply short-term stimulus to a sluggish economy. But on the energy problems 
that began on the West Coast and have swept across the country, Bush II is as 
scornful of short-term fixes as his father was a decade ago.
This week the administration is releasing its energy plan -- crafted by a 
task force under Vice President Dick Cheney -- in an atmosphere of growing 
crisis. Even before summer has arrived, California is experiencing rolling 
blackouts. Oregon and Washington have sacrificed the salmon runs to save 
river water for hydroelectric power. Midwest gasoline prices have surged past 
$2 a gallon. And natural gas prices are sky-high everywhere.
When I spent a weekend at Rocky Mountain College in Montana earlier this 
month, I was astonished to learn that even in that energy-exporting state, 
the first phase of deregulation has sent prices soaring and made energy the 
hottest issue.
In the face of all this, Cheney and Bush have refused to consider temporary 
price caps on electric power or any other short-term "fix" that violates 
free-market principles. The complex of production incentives and conservation 
measures that make up the energy strategy is designed to bring supply and 
demand into balance over the next several years, not to provide immediate 
relief.
That may be sound economics, but it leaves congressional Republicans as 
nervous as their counterparts were 10 years ago. Rep. Tom Davis, the able 
Virginian who heads the National Republican Congressional Committee, told me 
last week that he is hearing more worries from his colleagues about energy 
prices than about the overall economy.
"We can stand one bad summer," Davis said, "but if we're facing the same 
thing next summer, we've got problems."
Davis said he had communicated his party's concerns to the White House. "Do 
they get the message?" I asked.
"No," he said. "They think in four-year terms; we think in two."
That comment reflects a reality that few politicians are as candid as Davis 
in acknowledging. Much as the members of one party's congressional wing may 
hope for a president of their own party, who will sign the bills they pass 
and help them raise money for their own campaigns, owning the White House 
creates dilemmas.
The basic political strategy is always set by the president's people, and 
naturally enough, they think about creating favorable conditions for the year 
in which he will run for reelection. They can be more patient, and more 
oblivious to short-term problems, than those who are focused on the battle 
for the House and Senate.
Republicans like Tom Davis remember that eight years ago, when the Democrats 
controlled both the White House and Congress, it was Clinton's policy 
decisions on taxes, trade, guns and health care that left his party so 
vulnerable that Democrats lost both the House and Senate in 1994. That's the 
risk Republicans are facing now. And that's why they're nervous.

More Than California's Problem 
By Gray Davis

Wednesday, May 16, 2001; Page A23 
SACRAMENTO -- As President Bush this week rolls out his new energy policy, I 
once again urge him to confront the energy elephant in the middle of the room 
-- the out-of-control wholesale prices of electricity in California and 
across the West.
In 1996, California ventured headlong into a flawed scheme to deregulate 
electricity. Although Californians were promised lower rates and plentiful 
supply, both predictions have turned out to be disastrously wrong. We have 
now seen our first statewide rolling blackouts since World War II. Unheard-of 
wholesale prices for power have bankrupted our largest utility, threaten to 
bankrupt the second largest and have begun to seriously affect our economy. 
If we don't get the situation under control, it could quickly threaten our 
national economy.
California bears some fault for the current situation. In addition to the 
botched deregulation plan, centermost was our failure for the 12 years before 
I took office to build any major power plants. But my administration has 
moved quickly to remedy that by streamlining the permitting process for 
generating facilities. In the past two years, my energy commission has 
licensed 14 new major power plants, nine are under construction, and four 
will be on line this summer or fall. Nearly a dozen more are in the pipeline. 
In addition, we've approved six new "peaker" plants to meet this summer's 
demand. We're moving at unprecedented speed to deal with the supply problem.
The state, however, has absolutely no jurisdiction over the wholesale prices 
being charged by the unregulated, mostly out-of-state generators that 
purchased the utilities' power plants as part of deregulation. Since the 
Federal Power Act was passed in 1935, price regulation has been the exclusive 
domain of the federal government. But the Bush administration and the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission have consistently refused to carry out their 
statutory obligation to ensure energy prices are "just and reasonable."
To the contrary, the free-market ideologues in the administration argue that 
uncontrolled market prices are needed in order to increase the supply of 
electricity. In other words, if we don't allow power generators to shoot the 
moon on prices, they won't have sufficient incentive to build additional 
supply. That's as ridiculous as saying we need to pay dairies $300 a gallon 
to motivate them to produce milk. In fact, I have joined my fellow governors 
in Oregon and Washington in proposing temporary cost-based pricing that would 
still allow generators and marketers a healthy profit -- but without 
bankrupting the system.
Last week, however, Vice President Dick Cheney told the Los Angeles Times 
that he would remain philosophically opposed to any federal intervention on 
wholesale power prices even if it threatened the national economy. With all 
due respect to the vice president, that is one of the most irresponsible 
statements I've ever heard. Here is the eye-popping result of the federal 
government's rigid stance: In the spring of 2000, a megawatt of electricity 
in California cost an average of $30. By last December, after the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission precipitously removed the hard price cap of $250 
per megawatt hour that been in effect, the spot-market price shot up to 
$1,500 for the same megawatt of power. Just last week, we paid an astounding 
per-megawatt record of $1,900 to Houston-based Reliant Energy for the last 
100 megawatts of power we needed to keep the lights on.
The macro result of this unconscionable price gouging is predictable -- and 
scary. In 1999, California power users paid approximately $7 billion for all 
electricity consumed. Last year, that figure shot up to $27 billion. This 
year, estimates are that total spending on electrical power may hit $50 
billion to $60 billion.
The California Independent System Operator, the state's electric grid 
manager, has estimated in a report to the federal energy commission that 
electricity overcharges during the past year have totaled more than $6 
billion. Even the federal commission itself has formally ruled that the 
electricity market in California is dysfunctional and that prices charged 
have been unjust and unreasonable.
Where is that money going? Simply put, into the pockets of the generators and 
marketers -- almost all of them in the South and many of them located in 
Texas. It is one of the most massive transfers of wealth from the consumers 
of one state to companies located in another region of the country in our 
nation's history. But other than ordering a pittance in limited refunds -- 
none of which has yet been returned to the state -- the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission has stood fast in its opposition to real price caps.
The day before President Bush was sworn in, he stated on national television 
that the energy problem here was California's to solve. Well, we are moving 
aggressively to do our part to get it under control on both the generation 
and conservation fronts. But without just and reasonable prices for wholesale 
power, the crisis inevitably will spill over and damage the already-sluggish 
national economy.
That, Mr. President, not only will be your problem, it will affect every one 
of us. Californians are demanding action. We are doing our part, leading the 
nation in building power plants and in aggressive conservation. The federal 
government must do its part to temporarily control runaway energy prices in 
the West until we can bring on line the major new power plants California has 
approved.

Linda,

Per our conversation today, I am emailing you the pertintent documents 
outlining our efforts in NY.  The key document you will want to read through 
is the ESES Message Action Memo (it's about 15 pages and it details the 
comprehensive  PR effort).  The other important attachment is the Concept 
Board for the potential ad campaign.  (THIS IS ONLY A CONCEPT BOARD AND WILL 
PROBABLY BE TWEAKED, BUT IT GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF HOW AN AD MIGHT LOOK/SOUND.  
THE PR FIRM SORT OF MIXES RETAIL AND WHOLESALE MAREKTS BUT WE CAN FIX THAT).

I have left a message for Howard to call Jim D'Andrea, who has represented 
Keyspan at the coalition meetings, so that Jim knows you are calling his CEO. 

The coalition has been discussing this effort since Feb 1st.  Edison Mission, 
Keyspan and Morgan Stanley want to contribute money only and remain anonymous 
(all for different reasons).  They made their concerns known to the group 
from the start, but other companies hopped on that bandwagon last week.  The 
take away from today's meeting (Keyspan was not present) was as follows:

Our coalition is small (10 companies)
If 3 companies are out front (enron, dynegy and mirant) and 7 companies only 
contribute and attempt to remain anonymous - the reporters will ignore our 
message and write the story about the "anonymous donors"....not a good way to 
launch a coalition effort.
We would also be ignoring the $42,000 of research we paid for which concluded 
that people want to hear from "honest brokers", they want to know who we are, 
what we advocate and they want to be educated on what it is we're saying.
Today, the group agreed to go back and get a full commitment for 
participation from their companies.  Without full commitment and up front 
participation the group can't go foward.  
Even Edison Mission is going back and asking to fully participate (deal with 
any criticisms now rather than later).
No one believes that Morgan Stanley will commit to full participation given 
they are a unique company in this mix (but companies seem to be okay with 
them peeling off).
Thus, we need to ask Keyspan to rethink their role in the coaltion.  Can they 
go beyond a contributing role and be up front?
We'd love to have them fully participate, and we need to pose the question 
one last time. (Keyspan was not present for the PR presentation last week 
either so I highly doubt they have seen the plan in it's entirety (attached)
Coalition members agreed that they love the plan that our PR firm has 
presented.  This is a unique opportunity - one we don't want to miss when so 
many companies are aligning themselves with coalitions in preparation for the 
summer.  
(Phil Harris sent a letter to all PJM member companies asking for their 
participation in a similar effort). And IPPNY is also implementing a PR 
effort in NY (albeit a more narrow effort).

I'm back in Houston at 11:00 Thursday if you have additional questions.  

THANK YOU!
(DEADLINE FOR COMPANIES TO DECIDE IS FRIDAY AT NOON).

Rick/Mark:

Thought you might want to see the concept board that SSK came up with.  
Please see note below, which SSK sent to a Constellation employee who 
couldn't attend the meeting last week.  
***************************************

lindy:

thanks for the input.

also, per your request from yesterday, attached please find a PDF file with 
the visual concept board that was presented at last friday's meeting.  again, 
as we discussed, this is NOT an ad, and it's not intended to be presented as 
an ad, despite the fact that it very much looks like an ad.  rather, it's an 
illustration of how the research-based strategic insights to this complex 
issue can be distilled down to a single-minded concept with an easy visual 
read.  as i mentioned yesterday, i am concerned that anyone who will view 
this ad out of context could misconstrue what it is and what its purpose is.

thanks again,

jonathan

To EPSA's Public Affairs & State Issues Committees:

During our steering committee call this morning on the Powerful Future Media 
Campaign, the group reinforced a desire to move forward expeditiously with 
production of our campaign, while at the same time reaching out to other 
potential stakeholders to join us in some paid media education/advocacy 
regarding the lessons from California.

The group is currently reviewing some initial drafts, and it appears likely 
that we'll be able to take advantage of some already booked studio time next 
Tuesday.

It also was agreed that we shift our approach somewhat - away from targeted 
states and toward targeted markets, supplemented by some placements in 
national regulator/legislator publications to help us cover the loss of a few 
state capitals.

Although, the actual markets and their priority will be determined by the 
"phase two" funders and their available resources, the plan envisions 
placements in east coast markets from at least Boston through Washington, 
D.C., as well Seattle and Portland in the West.  Other markets could also be 
included as we go.  At this point, the group decided against any California 
placements.  The total estimated budget for these buys is similar to that 
previously distributed.

Still plenty of room on the bandwagon, so please give me a call if I can be 
of further assistance, (202) 628-8200, ext. 103.

Regards,
Mark S.

Cheney's Role Offers Strengths And Liabilities 
By Mike Allen and Dana Milbank
Washington Post Staff Writers
Thursday, May 17, 2001; Page A01 
The key to the energy proposal President Bush unveils today can be found on a 
wall in the three-room suite that houses his National Energy Policy 
Development Group, next door to the White House in the Eisenhower Executive 
Office Building.
On the wall hangs a huge erasable board that serves as a giant checklist to 
guide the preparation of the administration's eight-chapter energy policy, 
which Bush formally unveils in Minnesota today. For each chapter, there's a 
check mark for two rough drafts, a peer review, a final draft, two more 
rounds of recommendations on the drafts, then graphics and photos. Toward the 
end of the checklist is an all-important box to check: "Concurrence of the 
OVP."
The OVP -- Office of the Vice President -- has driven every aspect of the 
energy report. No proposed recommendation has survived without the consent of 
one man: Vice President Cheney, the administration's indispensable man -- and 
chair of the energy task force.
The release of the energy report shines a new spotlight on Cheney, a quiet 
conservative from Wyoming who has been given credit for running the show 
without annoying or upstaging his boss. The handling of the energy task force 
so far reflects Cheney's personality near perfectly: It is a closely held 
process with a high regard for the concerns of industry. This close 
involvement of Cheney is partially a strength, because the effort has been 
efficient and well-managed.
But Cheney's strong role is also potentially the report's weakness. He is 
about to undergo a blast of unwanted scrutiny as critics seize on his 
finances and oil industry ties in an effort to discredit the policy.
Democrats and environmental groups are charging that his judgment on energy 
matters is suspect because of his chairmanship until August of Halliburton 
Co., a Dallas-based energy services firm that is expected to benefit from 
several parts of President Bush's policy. Cheney, 60, made $36 million last 
year, most it in compensation from Halliburton, including salary and his 
exercise of stock options and sale of restricted stock.
"He is seeing the problem entirely from the side of the energy producing 
industry that made him a millionaire, not from a consumer struggling to make 
ends meet," said Philip E. Clapp, president of the National Environmental 
Trust.
An official close to Cheney called such suggestions "an outrage," and said 
his expertise in the industry and knowledge of its technology were crucial to 
"trying to solve a problem of this magnitude."
Although the plan has extensive recommendations about using technology to 
conserve energy and produce power more cleanly, the heart of the report is 
its conclusion that the United States needs hundreds more power plants, 
natural gas pipelines, oil wells and nuclear reactors.
Several administration officials acknowledged that Cheney had handed 
ammunition to his critics by declaring in a speech in Toronto on April 30 
that conservation "may be a sign of personal virtue," but is not a sound 
basis for a comprehensive energy policy.
"Given his background, he should've been real careful," said Sen. Charles E. 
Schumer (D-N.Y.), who has offered an alternative energy plan that he says 
focuses equally on supply and demand. "I think they've had some real 
stumbles."
Sen. Craig Thomas (R), who succeeded Cheney as Wyoming's lone House member in 
1989, said he does not expect such criticism to rattle the circumspect 
Cheney. "He'll just say, 'All right. That's the way it is, folks. I'm doing 
my job. Here's my plan,' " Thomas said.
As always when questions are asked about Cheney's influence, White House 
officials argue vigorously that the energy plan is Bush's plan. An official 
close to Bush said Cheney and other task force members had updated the 
president often since beginning their work on Jan. 29. "At several critical 
decision points, the group has come to the president to ask him to make 
judgments and decisions," the official said.
Cheney's directions are carried out by the task force's executive director, 
Andrew Lundquist, his deputy, Karen Knudsen, and four other staff members. 
Cheney also chairs the task force itself, which includes the secretaries of 
energy, interior, treasury, agriculture, commerce and transportation and the 
head of the Environmental Protection Agency.
Aides say Cheney met with only half a dozen of the interest groups seeking 
input into the policy, including Enron Corp., the Houston energy conglomerate 
that is a large and longtime Bush contributor, and the Edison Electric 
Institute, an energy trade group. Vance Meyer, a spokesman for Enron, said 
the firm's chairman, Kenneth Lay, and another executive had a 30-minute 
meeting with Cheney. Edison assembled 15 or 20 chief executives to meet with 
Cheney.
But Lundquist and Knudsen, representing Cheney, met with half of the 400 or 
so groups -- industry, environmental, regulatory and academic -- that 
requested access. Exactly which groups the Cheney advisers met with is being 
kept secret by the White House.
The task force's stealthy operation reflects Cheney's distaste for publicity. 
Following news reports about the private nature of the energy deliberations, 
Democrats on the House Energy and Commerce Committee and Government Reform 
Committee requested information about the groups the task force met with. 
Cheney's counsel, David S. Addington, rebuffed the members of Congress, 
arguing that there was no legal requirement to comply with the request.
In a seven-page response to the request, Lundquist wrote that the meetings 
"were simply forums to collect individual views rather than to bring a 
collective judgment to bear." White House officials have declined to disclose 
the list of meetings or attendees. Aides said representatives at the meetings 
included 118 energy industry or corporate groups, 40 renewable energy 
providers, 22 unions, 13 environmental groups, five academics, 63 
governmental groups, six energy efficiency proponents and a consumer group.
Environmentalists complain that the meetings reflected Cheney's 
predispositions. The vice president met with industry leaders, while 
dispatching aides to speak to environmentalists, several of which were 
grouped into one meeting. The meetings of 22 labor representatives, who 
gathered in groups, were publicized by the White House, but sessions with 
industry were not.
Cheney, who declined to be interviewed for this article, told the Associated 
Press that he hasn't consulted with any officials from Halliburton and 
rejected the notion that the task force's work is compromised by his private 
meetings with industry officials who give money to the Republican Party. 
"Just because somebody makes a campaign contribution doesn't mean that they 
should be denied the opportunity to express their views to government 
officials," he said.
Cheney chaired nine meetings of the Cabinet-level task force, mostly in his 
ceremonial office. Each of the meetings, attended by the task force members 
and aides, lasted 90 minutes, with Environmental Protection Agency 
Administrator Christine Todd Whitman, Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham and 
Bush economic adviser Lawrence B. Lindsey often reflecting different 
interests.
For 20 minutes at the end of each session, Cheney told staffers to leave the 
room so the top officials could settle differences privately, without risk of 
the differences being leaked to the news media. In only a few cases did Bush 
have to resolve disputes among advisers, participants said. In most cases, 
Cheney was able discreetly to broker agreement among the Cabinet members.

Attached is a letter Marathon drafted to send to the top 100+ CA businesses 
in our database giving them info on our "comprehensive solution."  Rather 
than attach the solution document as is, I'd recommend a shorter, simplified 
version, plus an overview page that answers "What does this do for: 
customers?  the state?  utilities?  marketers/generators?"  

Also, what is it we want these business leaders to do?  Do we want them to 
write/call/weigh-in w/ their legislators and the governor?  Do we want them 
to be signatories on a formal proposal?

Please let me know what you think. 

Thanks.

Hi Karen:

It was good to see you Friday.  I hope you had a nice visit in So. Cal.

I've attached a draft letter to existing list of CEO's from Ken Lay for your
review.  The attached draft letter assumes that the background material from
Jeff will be enclosed and that the sample letter to Gov. Davis, et. al. asks
for support of specific legislation, policies.

If we've got this wrong, let us know and we will try again.

Sandra

In an Era of Deregulation, Enron Woos Regulators More Than Ever

By Bob Davis and Rebecca Smith
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

WASHINGTON -- Every energy executive in America would have liked a half-hour 
with Vice President Dick Cheney as he fashioned the Bush administration's 
national energy program. Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth Lay got it.

Mr. Lay used the time to set out an eight-point agenda intended, among other 
things, to head off price controls on wholesale electricity, provide Enron 
and other energy traders with unfettered access to the nation's 
electricity-transmission system and remove regulatory obstacles to building 
new generating plants and power lines. The energy plan President Bush 
unveiled Thursday reflected many of those same priorities.

In an interview last week, the vice president said he also met with other 
energy executives, but Mr. Lay was the only one he named. Mr. Cheney says he 
sought Mr. Lay's advice because "Enron has a different take than most energy 
companies."

Indeed, Enron Corp. is a modern paradox. It has transformed itself over the 
past 15 years from a stodgy gas-pipeline operator into the nation's largest 
trader of gas and electricity and a formidable player in newer markets such 
as telecommunications services and emissions-reduction credits. Today, it's 
the quintessential model of a company dedicated to free markets.

Yet as much as any company in the U.S., it has cultivated close ties with 
government. Since the late 1980s, the Houston-based company, which was 
President George W. Bush's biggest corporate campaign donor, has beefed up 
its lobbying staff, boosted its political contributions and sought out 
friends in the world of politics. Now, with Mr. Bush in the White House, it 
is in a unique position to see whether those efforts will pay off.

Enron's lobbying blitz reflects one of the ironies of the era of 
deregulation. Just as government created immense telephone, electric and gas 
monopolies early in the last century, Enron and other players feel they need 
the government's help in opening up those monopolies and gaining access to 
once-closed markets.

In particular, Enron wants the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to ensure 
that energy is deregulated on terms favorable to the company. Rather than 
having the nation's transmission lines controlled by the utilities, it wants 
those lines to provide open access for new entrants such as Enron eager to 
buy and sell power.

Mr. Lay is on a first-name basis with a half-dozen members of the Bush 
cabinet and knows many senior White House staffers from their days in the 
Texas governor's mansion with Mr. Bush. Before joining the administration, 
both White House economist Lawrence Lindsey and U.S. Trade Representative 
Robert Zoellick were on Enron's advisory board, which pays members an annual 
stipend of $50,000.

Under Mr. Lay, Enron has donated nearly $2 million to Mr. Bush during his 
political career. Since the start of the 2000 campaign, Enron and its 
employees have contributed $1.3 million to the Bush presidential drive, the 
Republican Party and the presidential inauguration, says the Center for 
Responsive Politics. Enron also accounted for $461,000 in contributions 
during Mr. Bush's two runs for governor, according to the Center for Public 
Integrity.

Mr. Lay, who holds a doctorate in economics, says all he wants from 
government is a fair shake. Enron supports candidates "you believe in," he 
says. "You believe in their value system, you believe in their philosophy and 
you believe they'll do the right things as leaders."

But it's clear that Mr. Lay wants more than that from government. For now, he 
is focusing on FERC, where he worked in the early 1970s when the agency was 
known as the Federal Power Commission. He hopes to make FERC his ally in 
beating back the power of utilities. Long dismissed as a regulatory backwater 
overseeing wholesale transactions by electric and gas utilities, the 
commission has emerged as the chief navigator of the nation's transition to a 
fully deregulated energy marketplace.

Even before Mr. Bush took office, FERC had begun to rein in the market power 
of utilities. In December, FERC told the nation's utilities that it wanted 
them to voluntarily surrender their high-voltage lines -- those that can 
dispatch electricity across state lines -- to independent grid operators, 
such as those already in place in California and the Northeast, which would 
provide open access to the lines. Although it told the utilities to submit 
plans for doing so, many of them have been reluctant to relinquish control of 
their lines to such independent organizations.

Mr. Lay wants FERC to go further, forcing the utilities to cede direct 
control of their lines. He also is seeking rules that would end what he calls 
energy "balkanization" and create "seamless" interstate electricity markets.

"Enron is the biggest gas and electric company entirely dependent on the 
competitive side of the business," says Andre Meade, an analyst for 
Commerzbank. "To the extent deregulation slows down, their business slows 
down."

Right now it's a lucrative strategy. Enron typically targets tightly 
controlled markets just as they are opening up, using its financial clout and 
risk-management savvy to gain a dominant market position. In doing so, it 
frequently portrays itself as an insurgent taking on entrenched interests.

In electricity, for instance, Enron buys the output of generating plants, 
sometimes days, weeks or years before the power is actually produced. Using 
sophisticated weather data, it determines the most lucrative market for the 
power, finds a buyer and then arranges delivery via transmission lines owned 
by others. It hedges its positions with other contracts. Its wholesale 
trading volume climbed 55% for natural gas and more than doubled for 
electricity in the first quarter alone. Such growth pushed Enron's wholesale 
energy-trading income, before taxes and interest, up more than threefold to 
$785 million during the first quarter.

Between 1996 and 2000, Enron's yearly net income nearly doubled to $979 
million and its revenue increased almost eightfold to $100.8 billion. Over 
the same period, Enron's stock price, adjusted for splits, rose more than 
fourfold.

At the start of the Bush administration, FERC's future was very much up for 
grabs. Two of the five seats on the commission were vacant, and Enron quickly 
sought to fill them with activist Republicans. President Bush named a friend 
of his and Enron's to one of those seats: Texas utility-regulator Pat Wood. 
Mr. Wood had worked closely with Enron during a six-year effort to open 
Texas' retail electricity market. Mr. Wood also had shown the kind of 
backbone Enron wanted in a separate fight over telephone deregulation when he 
insisted on closely monitoring phone utilities to make sure they opened their 
networks to competitors.

Higher Profile
For the second slot, Enron backed Nora Mead Brownell, a Pennsylvania utility 
regulator. She had come to Enron's aid in 1997 when she voted to block an 
electricity-market restructuring plan backed by Philadelphia's utility and by 
GOP Gov. Tom Ridge. Enron argued that the plan would have locked it out of 
the Philadelphia market.

Enron worked to raise Ms. Brownell's visibility by lobbying the House 
Commerce Committee to include her as an expert witness on energy issues and 
as a member of an informal advisory group, say Enron and congressional aides. 
Mr. Lay provided heavyweight support. He says Enron included Ms. Brownell's 
name on its "priority list" of a half-dozen prospective FERC nominees. And 
when her candidacy ran into opposition from Pennsylvania officials with 
bitter memories of her 1997 decision, Mr. Lay says he phoned Karl Rove, the 
White House's top political strategist, to tell him that "she was a strong 
force in getting the right outcome" in Pennsylvania."

A White House spokeswoman says that a number of individuals and industry 
groups weighed in favor of Ms. Brownell, but she declined to name any. Ms. 
Brownell says she was unaware of any concerted Enron campaign on her behalf. 
She didn't ask the White House who had supported her because, she says, "I 
didn't want to be beholden."

Meanwhile, Enron was using its Democratic contacts to strengthen its ties 
with Linda Breathitt, a Kentucky Democrat on the commission. Earlier this 
spring, the company hired two of former Vice President Al Gore's closest 
friends as lobbyists: Nashville lawyer Charles Bones and Mr. Gore's 
campaign-finance director, Johnny Hayes. Both had come to know Ms. Breathitt 
through Democratic politics.

Ms. Breathitt says she wasn't very familiar with Enron's interests, but that 
she accepted when Mr. Hayes invited her to dinner at a Washington restaurant 
in April to meet Richard Shapiro, Enron's managing director for government 
affairs. "Everyone likes to get to know the FERC commissioners," Ms. 
Breathitt says, adding that she always pays for her own meals.

Enron has long played this kind of insider's game. Mr. Lay has been friendly 
with both Democratic and Republican administrations over the past 25 years, 
sharing time on the links with Presidents Bill Clinton and Gerald Ford. He's 
been a particularly close friend of the Bush family. In the late 1980s, he 
ran then-Vice President George H.W. Bush's fund-raising drives in Texas. 
After the younger Bush became governor, he appointed Mr. Lay to run the 
influential Governor's Business Council. Mr. Lay also made Enron's fleet of 
corporate jets available to the new governor and won his help in lobbying 
officials considering Enron projects.

In March 1997, Mr. Lay wrote Gov. Bush to ask that he lobby the Texas 
congressional delegation to support export-finance credits critical to Enron, 
according to letters released by the Texas State Archivist's office. In April 
1997, when Enron was negotiating a $2 billion natural-gas joint venture in 
Uzbekistan, Mr. Lay wrote to thank the governor for meeting with the 
Uzbekistani ambassador to the U.S. Six months later, another Lay thank-you 
note concerned a phone call Mr. Bush made to Pennsylvania Gov. Ridge to 
support Enron's plan to enter the Philadelphia electricity market. "I am 
certain it will have a positive impact," Mr. Lay wrote.

Mr. Lay says he hasn't sought Mr. Bush's aid directly since Mr. Bush won the 
presidency. Last month, he talked with the president briefly at a Houston 
benefit for the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy, on which Mr. Lay 
serves as co-chairman. "It's not a matter of us going off hunting or fishing 
or sitting around and having drinks," he says.

Not all Mr. Lay's initiatives have been successful. When Mr. Bush reneged in 
March on a campaign pledge to fight global warming by requiring reductions in 
carbon-dioxide levels produced by burning hydrocarbons, Mr. Lay says he 
telephoned Mr. Cheney to complain. "The scientific evidence, although 
certainly not conclusive, is pretty compelling that there could be a 
climate-change problem," he says he told the vice president. "The 
administration should still look very seriously at it."

Around the same time, Mr. Lay also called Mr. Rove, the White House political 
adviser, to urge him to talk to Fred Krupp, the head of the moderate 
Environmental Defense Fund. Messrs. Krupp and Rove spoke briefly but found 
little common ground. Later, Enron, which has plans to add emission credits 
to the commodities it trades, joined a coalition urging mandatory reductions 
in carbon-dioxide levels.

But Enron saved its main lobbying push for Mr. Cheney's energy task force. In 
April, Mr. Lay met with the panel's staff director, Andrew Lundquist, and 
later, with Mr. Cheney, whom Mr. Lay had come to know well when the vice 
president was chief of Halliburton Co., a Dallas construction company. "We 
built Enron Field together," says Mr. Lay, referring to Houston's new 
ballpark.

In both meetings, say Enron and White House officials, Mr. Lay presented a 
broad agenda for opening up the nation's electrical system and used the 
gas-transmission system as a point of comparison. In both cases, he argues, 
pipelines and transmission lines should be like the federal highway system 
that offers easy access to all.

Finding the Bottlenecks
The Cheney report uses similar language, describing the electrical grid as 
"the highway for interstate commerce in electricity." As Enron sought, the 
report directs the energy secretary to determine by the end of the year 
whether it makes sense to establish a national grid, and to identify 
bottlenecks in the transmission system as well as how to remove them. An 
effort to make the grid national would enhance FERC's power, as Enron has 
urged.

The report is mum on some Enron concerns, such as requiring utilities to join 
regional transmission organizations, an idea strongly opposed by the utility 
industry. A White House aide says the task force didn't want to get involved 
in such battles between industries.

As solid as its support in the White House has turned out to be, Enron is 
worried about the backlash against electricity deregulation in Western states 
and possibly in New York, should electricity rates surge this summer. Nevada 
repealed its deregulation law last month, spooked by the way skyrocketing 
wholesale-electricity prices in neighboring California were undermining the 
Golden State's economy. California and Oregon are contemplating 
state-government purchases of major utility assets.

Enron's biggest fear is that the political pressure will lead the states, or 
perhaps Congress, to control prices, which could undermine Enron's business.

In response, Enron has formed a coalition with eight other energy marketers 
in New York, who each have pledged $50,000 to pay for a media and lobbying 
campaign. It also has hired former Montana Gov. Marc Racicot and dispatched 
him to court Western politicians. Two weeks ago, Mr. Racicot had breakfast 
with an old colleague, Oregon's Democratic Gov. John Kitzhaber. After the two 
chatted about fly-fishing, says Mr. Kitzhaber, "Marc did say he was working 
to re-energize the discussion about energy and had some ideas for a framework 
the governors might want to consider."

Though Mr. Kitzhaber says he knew that Mr. Racicot had joined the Washington, 
D.C., lobbying firm Bracewell & Patterson, Mr. Racicot didn't disclose that 
he was on retainer to Enron -- and the star of Enron's Western states 
"advocacy team." For his part, Mr. Racicot says he was working "not at 
Enron's direction but with their knowledge" to advance positions that he, 
too, feels are important.

Local Public radio over the weekend had a story that Gov Davis, once seen for 
dead on the national front, has risen from the dead now that he has gone on 
the attack against Bush's energy plan -- I don't agree that he has riden yet, 
but that is certainly his plan.

Link is for an Orange County register article that discusses his Gore hires 
and notes his Washington strategy.

Please see the attached New Democrat Coalition Energy Policy outline.  While 
not a comprehensive document, it does NOT call for price caps.  The New Dem 
plan does call for the development of national interconnection, as well as a 
creation of an Energy Reliability Organization to help facilitate the role of 
RTOs.  

This is in stark comparison to the DNC and Democratic Policy Committees 
approach.

Attached on the Cheney Report came via INGAA.  For those in the DC office, I 
have already printed hard copies if you would like one in that form.  These 
documents appear to be summaries and background materials on the Cheney 
report plus comparisons with the House Democrat's plan released yesterday.

		 Subject: Is Price Gouging Root of Crisis?

Following is the editorial that resulted from IEP's editorial board meeting 
with the Orange County register on 
May 24:


Is price gouging root of crisis? 
Orange County Register Editorial
May 21, 2001

The president is "allowing the price-gouging energy companies, many of whom 
reside in Texas, to get away with murder," Gov. Gray Davis said on Thursday 
in response to a George W. Bush energy plan that doesn't call for caps on the 
price of electricity sold by out-of-state generators to California. 

This remark captured the essence of the Davis approach to the energy 
problems: Blame everybody else, call for government price controls even 
though they historically have reduced the supply of energy, and use divisive 
and even conspiratorial rhetoric.

On the same day Governor Davis was blasting the Bush energy plan, his 
appointee who runs the Public Utilities Commission, Loretta Lynch, told a 
newspaper that power generators purposefully keep their plants idle to jack 
up prices. Attorney General Bill Lockyer said that he found evidence of what 
Ms. Lynch called "artificial shortages."

We're interested in seeing the evidence, of course. But it looks suspiciously 
like politicians are using the "power-gouging" theory as a way to bluster 
rather than come up with concrete solutions. It also is a way for those who 
are ideologically hostile to deregulation - perhaps cynical of business and 
capitalism in general - to demonize merchant generators and pave the way for 
a government takeover.

No doubt, wholesale electricity prices have skyrocketed. Prices zoomed from 
$200 a megawatt hour late last year to nearly $2,000 last week, according to 
the San Francisco Chronicle. The newspaper reports that plant shutdowns are a 
cause of the price spike.

Yet a number of analysts have found the price-gouging theory to be dubious. A 
Dow Jones Newswire column analyzed Federal Energy Regulatory Commission data 
on the amount of forced outages over the past two summers. Yes, there were 
nearly four times as many plant closures by plants owned by five big 
producers in summer 2000 than in summer 1999. But, as writer Mark Golden 
pointed out, outages for all plants - including municipally owned ones and 
small Qualifying Facilities that have no incentive to game the system - were 
658 percent higher in summer 2000 than in summer 1999. The writer notes that 
"four of the Big 5 are either constructing big new generators in California 
or have applied for permits to do so. That would seem to fly in the face of a 
withholding strategy."

An April paper co-authored by William Hogan, a professor at the John F. 
Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, could not prove there 
wasn't manipulation, but explained, "it is unlikely to be the dominant factor 
and may not even be significant."

The bigger issue, the Hogan paper argued, is the "seriously flawed" 
restructuring system that caused the electricity market collapse. "[T]he 
principal policy focus should be on fashioning workable solutions for the 
other more serious problems in the market design that relate to the 
underlying causes of the market meltdown."

Other analysts argue that, to whatever degree price-gouging has taken place, 
it is solely the fault of the retail price caps and other government rules 
that have distorted the market.

The large number of shutdowns has not been the result of any conspiracy, the 
power generators say, but the result of needed maintenance on facilities that 
have been overworked. Many of these are older plants that require more 
shutdowns for maintenance than new ones.

"People can invest money in various different markets," Jan Smutny-Jones told 
us; he is executive director of the Independent Energy Producers Association 
in Sacramento, which represents QFs and merchant generators. With politically 
charged hearings, demonization of power generators, proposals for 
excess-profits taxes and threats of seizing property made by California 
Democrats, he said generators may conclude that California is a dangerous 
place to invest.

Gov. Davis said the Bush plan won't add any new electrical power. But neither 
will Davis' grandstanding about price-gougers. 

In fact, it may even dissuade electricity investment. The governor needs to 
apply his "will it create new power?" standard to his own rhetoric, then get 
busy leading the state out of this mess.

Subject: Phil Angelides Remarks


Phil Angelides addressed Town Hall Los Angeles last week about the energy
crisis.  Angelides was the first speaker in Town Hall's energy series.
Upcoming speakers include John Bryson, Steve Letbetter, Loretta Lynch, and
Ken Lay.

Angelides made the following comments regarding the energy crisis:

1.  A sharp downturn in California will send the national economy into a
slide
2.  California deregulation is a virus that will kill deregulation
nationally.
3.  The power shortage is a problem of our own making.
4.  Californians must conserve power in record-setting levels.
5.  The Governor and Legislator must level with citizens about the energy
crisis
6.  Utility rates must penalize consumption
7.  Californians must unite to reign in generators
8.  The Federal government should impose wholesale price caps
9.  If FERC will not fulfill its obligation to set fair and reasonable
prices, or the price of electricity
     increases 50% more, Californians must fend for themselves, possibly
through the formation of a
     buyers cartel with Oregon and Wash. or by seizing power plants.

The problems I see are as follows:
1) most of the people in the room are technical people (ISO focused) and not 
familiar with PR efforts/plans.  Some have brought PR people on board, but it 
was late in the process.

2) Edison Mission, Keyspan and Morgan Stanley have always had reservations 
from day one.  All for different reasons.  Others have joined 
them...Constellation, Aquila (i'm not sure why).  

3) Some of the companies are saying different things:  Constellation on the 
one hand wants to be in "everyone's rolodex as the coalition that the press 
calls for information regarding competitive market structure in NY"  and then 
they say they don't want anyone to know they're in the coalition.  ????

4) Mirant wants to lop onto what IPPNY is doing (very small, cheap effort 
targeted at Albany and bringing on new supply).

5) Dynegy wants (given the situation) for SSK to give us messge points and 
then assignments for all of us to go meet with people as individual companies 
not as a coaltion.  (this is where I think we waste our money)

6) Budget has always been an issue if we do the SSK plan -- it's not cheap 
but it gets us the traction we're looking for.  

7) I don't think it's falling apart in the 11th hour as much as I think 
people have always had reservations and/or different views of how we would 
exist and maybe we were miscommunicating the whole time (although based on 
the materials, I thought it was pretty straightforward what we were 
considering doing all along".  

8) Maybe Howard can give you something else that I'm missing.  

9) I'll keep y ou posted.

Please keep this under wraps.  We do not want to circulate this beyond the 
folks listed on this email.  Please let me know any concerns.   As we have 
known for several weeks, the report is not as explicit as we would want, but 
the White House , Vice President, and DOE have repeatedly but verbally 
assured us that they are making clear to FERC (via Pat Wood) exactly what 
this means.

Presidents Bush (Former and Current) Speak on Energy Issues 

By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis 

[IMAGE]Introduced and sponsored by LODESTAR Corp.'s CEO Chris Hamilos, 
President George Herbert Walker Bush delivered the keynote presentation this 
morning at the 25th Annual CIS Conference being held in Albuquerque, N.M. The 
41st president of the United States spoke mostly from a personal perspective 
about the highlights of his illustrious business and political career, and 
reiterated his strong support for his son, President George W. Bush, whom he 
affectionately refers to as "43" (as in 43rd president). 

The former President Bush made it clear that he is now enjoying his 
retirement and avoids making public statements regarding political policy. 
However, the former president did field questions from the audience regarding 
a few energy issues and acknowledged the parallels between the issues he 
faced in his administration, and those that are presently challenging his 
son. Much of the buzz throughout the conference focused on the current 
president's just-released energy task plan, a 165-page report that outlines 
approximately 105 steps that the new administration will take to address 
current energy problems. 

Former President Bush recalled the Gulf War and how one of the key issues 
during that time was ensuring energy supply from Saudi Arabia. The former 
president acknowledged that he felt compelled to launch the battle against 
Saddam Hussein, who threatened the energy supplies needed to serve the world. 
Further, President Bush referred to the political challenges he faced in his 
presidency, during which time a predominantly Democratic Congress "that saw 
the big picture issues in a different light" often made it difficult to find 
common ground.  

The former president made only brief (but rather significant) references to 
his son's new energy policy. Having talked with Vice President Dick Cheney 
last evening, former President Bush said he was aware that the new, 
broad-based plan focused heavily on new supply, along with secondary measures 
for conservation efforts. This is an approach that the former president fully 
supports as he noted that "if you want to lower energy prices, you need to 
establish more supply." In addition, the former president offered that 
additional drilling efforts, an element of the plan that has sparked a great 
deal of controversy, "has to happen" if the nation is truly committed to 
increasing supply. However, former President Bush did suggest that the nation 
must be patient as it will take "several years" to see any significant 
decrease in energy prices as economic forces must be allowed to support new 
development efforts. 

Meanwhile, the energy task plan released by the current President Bush this 
morning holds few surprises but continues to spark a great deal of debate. As 
expected, the administration supports efforts for increased drilling of oil 
in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, easing of clean-air rules that 
should support increased power plant production and streamlining the permit 
process for oil refinery expansion and construction. These platforms have 
been in place for months and form the foundation for the energy plan.  

However, new elements of the plan that have emerged just within the last few 
days are raising the most eyebrows. For instance, the extent to which nuclear 
power factors into the administration's energy plan is perhaps greater than 
was previously anticipated. Specifically, the Bush plan proposes the 
extension of the life for aging nuclear plants and the use of so-called 
"breeder reactors," which use spent nuclear fuel. Breeder reactors, although 
rather common in Europe and Japan, have not been used in the United States 
since the 1970s, when it was discovered that the reactors tend to produce 
nuclear weapon-grade plutonium as a by-product.  

Other key elements of the plan include:  

Providing eminent domain authority to the federal government, which would 
supersede states' rights to approve new transmission line capacity. 
Expediting the license procedures for hydroelectric and geothermal plants.  
Streamlining the approval process for power plant siting, and speeding up the 
relicensing requirements for nuclear plants. 
Drafting legislation to cap emissions of nitrogen oxide and mercury, which 
are common by-products of coal-fired production. In turn, the Bush 
administration supports exploring new clean-coal technologies, which should 
increase production by coal-fired generating plants. 
A further study of the current restrictions put into place by the Clean Air 
Act, which presently limits the production at oil refineries and power 
plants. The issue here is whether or not such restrictions should be lifted 
or reduced so that additional oil and power production can be pursued. 

As has been the case since the start of the new administration, the 
continuing criticism of the new Bush plan is that it is overly specific and 
strong on new supply efforts, while remaining vague and noncommittal to 
conservation efforts. However, the specific conservation proposals in the 
energy plan include providing consumers $4 billion in tax credits through 
2007 to encourage the purchase of high-mileage, gas-electric hybrid vehicles. 
In addition, President Bush has proposed providing tax benefits to 
co-generation plants, which produce both heat and electricity. Others, 
including the current president's father, might argue that conservation 
efforts have received just the right amount of attention in the new plan as 
market forces (high prices) already are driving renewed conservation across 
the country.  

Just as former President Bush faced a predominantly Democratic Congress that 
often thwarted his policy measures, the current President Bush continues to 
buck heads with Democrats in Washington who are crafting their own energy 
plan. In fact, just two days ago, a group of House Democrats led by House 
Minority Leader Richard Gephardt (D-Miss.) outlined a plan that calls for 
increased oil drilling and building new pipelines to transport natural gas 
(both of which run rather parallel to the Bush plan). However, Democrats have 
focused more heavily on conservation efforts in their own plan, as 
illustrated by a series of tax incentives to help consumers build energy 
efficient homes and purchase hybrid gas and electric automobiles. 
Consequently, the energy issues continue to sharply divide the two parties, 
although in reality there may enough commonality among Republicans and 
Democrats to support cooperation in Congress. That cooperation may be 
necessary as Congress must approve President Bush's energy plan in order for 
it to take effect.

Dear Rick:

I am on the Hill with Steve Kean now.  Have not had a chance to do anything 
further on the bullet issue.  I just talked to Ed Gillespie who discussed the 
bullet as drafted last night with Andrew Lundquist today.  Andrew does not 
want to include the "rates, terms and conditions" sentence. Thus, my revision 
regarding non-jurisdicitional entities seems moot for the moment.  Ed pushed 
Andrew hard on the need to include first sentence of bullet.  Ed thinks he 
made progress on that.  I'm on the Hill the remainder of the afternoon.  I 
fly out of DCA @ 7:00 PM for San Antonio (Enron Law Conference).  Feel free 
to call me or Ed if you have questions.  (cell phone I'm using today:  
202-253-2625.)

Linda Robertson

Maybe include that cooncept as a backstop- reciprocity is not as good as 
jurisdiction.

One question.  The last document Steve had us send to Larry Lindsey contained 
a sentence that, through reciprocity type rules, FERC could exercise open 
access jurisdiction over public power agencies, thus avoiding the need for 
legislation.  What should we do?

 It is critical to our nation's energy future  to achieve robust competition 
in wholesale power markets in order to ensure that electricity can move most  
effectively from where it is produced to where it is most needed. To that 
end, this Administration will strongly encourage the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission( FERC)  to actively exercise jurisdiction over all 
aspects of electricity transmission in interstate commerce and place all uses 
of the grid under the same rates, terms, and conditions.  This jurisdiction 
must also be extended by Congress to cover non-FERC jurisdictional power 
authorities.

Enron hires ex-TVA head Hayes, Gore friend Bone
By Andy Sher
Washington Bureau

WASHINGTON -- A potential Tennessee Valley Authority competitor has hired
former TVA director Johnny Hayes and another close Tennessee friend of Al
Gore as lobbyists.

Congressional lobbyist records show that Mr. Hayes, who was the Gore 2000
presidential campaign's fund-raising director, registered with the House
clerk on May 1 to lobby for Houston-based Enron Corp.

Nashville attorney Charles W. Bone, another longtime Gore supporter,
registered to lobby for Enron the same day.

Enron is the nation's largest trader of natural gas and electricity. It is
headed by Kenneth Lay, a major financial supporter of President George W.
Bush, who defeated Democrat Gore last year.

Mr. Hayes served on the board of TVA, a federal utility, from 1993 until
January 1999, when he went to work for the Gore campaign.

In an interview, Mr. Hayes said his activities are between himself and his
clients.

"I haven't done anything wrong, won't do anything wrong and won't do
anything to hurt TVA," he said, also noting that it has been more than a
year since he left TVA.

Former TVA directors are subject to a one-year ban against seeking to
influence TVA on any matter, according to a summary of post-employment
activity laws supplied by the agency.

"I won't have any comment," Mr. Bone said in a phone message. "I never talk
about what I'm doing for clients."

Stephen Smith, executive director of Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, a
TVA watchdog and environmentalist group, said that while he knows Mr. Hayes
is an "honorable man," there are potential problems with a former TVA
insider going to work for Enron. Mr. Hayes "knows where the skeletons are
buried," Mr. Smith said.

"It's a classic. You got somebody who's a TVA board member who leaves to go
to work for someone who for all practical purposes is a competitor. I think
everybody in the valley should be a little concerned about it. ... I just
think folks need to come out on the record and say exactly what they're
doing. What they may be doing may be completely admirable."

Enron spokesman Eric Thode said Mr. Hayes was hired to lobby on "energy
issues, TVA-related, kind of a host of issues."

"TVA is one group he might work with," Mr. Thode said. He declined to say
how much Mr. Hayes is being paid. Enron spent $800,000 last year on its own
Washington lobby organization and hired other lobbyists as well -- one group
for $415,000.

TVA spokesman Gil Francis said he spoke to Mr. Hayes last Friday.

"And what he said was he has talked to some TVA staff on some TVA matters
and that is all he said," Mr. Francis said. He said the conversations were
with TVA power division staffers in Chattanooga.

In his lobbyist registration form for Enron, Mr. Hayes said he was lobbying
on "Power Plant Development/Utility deregulation."

The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Enron was using its
Democratic contacts to "strengthen ties" to Linda Breathitt, a Kentucky
Democrat who serves on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

The Journal reported that Mr. Hayes, who knew Ms. Breathitt through national
Democratic politics, invited her to a dinner at a Washington restaurant to
meet Enron's managing director for government affairs, Richard Shapiro.

Enron's Mr. Thode confirmed the account but provided little additional
information. The Journal said Enron wants FERC to restructure the electric
utility industry so that utilities such as TVA, which controls transmission
on its lines, will open their lines to everyone.

Mr. Thode said Mr. Hayes was not involved in Enron's recent settlement of a
dispute with TVA. It involved allegations that Enron had not lived up to a
contract to supply TVA fixed amounts of power during period of heavy demand.

According to Mr. Smith of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, TVA
received $200 million under the settlement -- an amount Mr. Thode and TVA's
Francis both refused to confirm, saying it was confidential.

Mr. Hayes also is registered to lobby for Choctaw Gas Generation, a
subsidiary of Tractebel Power Inc. of Houston, which built a lignite
coal-fired plant in Mississippi for TVA. He also is registered to lobby with
Voith Siemens Hydro Power Generation Inc., which is based in York, Pa., and
has a Chattanooga office.

In all three cases, Mr. Hayes registered under the company name of Sideview
Partners Inc.

Mr. Bone also is registered to lobby for Voith Siemens. He registered under
Wyatt, Tarrant and Combs, a Nashville law firm.

Mr. Hayes remains involved in politics. He is Democratic gubernatorial
hopeful Phil Bredesen's lead fund-raiser -- a nonpaid post.

Below is the exact wording of the recommendations in the Cheney energy report 
released today as the recommendations relate to electricity issues.

"The NEPD Group recommends that the President direct the Secretary of Energy 
to propose comprehensive electricity legislation that promotes competition, 
protects consumers, enhances reliability, promotes renewable energy, improves 
efficiency, repeals the Public Utility Holding Company Act, and reforms the 
Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act."

"The NEPD Group recommends that the President encourage FERC to use its 
existing statutory authority to promote competition and encourage investment 
in transmission facilities."

More details to follow.  We expect to have the full report document shortly.

I would drop the "while we have not had an opportunity to review the policy 
in detail.." phrase and simply start "We are..."  I don't think we should 
lead with a qualification.  Otherwise, looks great.

While we have not had an opportunity to review the policy in detail, we are 
encouraged that it is creating a healthy dialogue about energy solutions in 
the country.

We are not a large generator, so our main interest as a marketer is in moving 
energy from where it is to where it is needed.  Our expectation is that the 
Administration's policy will get the nation focused on how to make that 
happen through more open markets and transmission lines.

structure in 18-24 months (this can be accomplished without stranding CDWR's 
contracts)
Concessions

 -Generators (past due amounts)
 -investigations
Package to finance the deal (bond issuance backed by rate increases to permit 
securitization)

Message
This is the last best chance to achieve a comprehensive settlement
We have developed a comprehensive solution and are meeting with everyone that 
will see us.
We have thus far received positive feedback on and a willingness to work with 
our proposal

To EPSA's Public Affairs & State Issues Committees:

We're just a few companies short of our necessary threshold for launching 
creative and production work for our voluntary paid-media campaign in support 
of the pro-competition lessons from California.

Joining us so far in this effort are: AES NewEnergy, Duke Energy North 
America, Dynegy, El Paso Merchant Energy, Enron, Mirant, NRG Energy and 
Reliant Energy.  We also are coordinating with the Edison Electric 
Institute's third-party earned-media efforts in the Northeast and West, as 
well as with the earned- and paid-media efforts of the Chamber of Commerce 
Alliance for Energy and Economic Growth in support of a new national energy 
policy.

To help expedite the process, we will schedule an initial conference call for 
Thursday, May 24, for the pro-competition campaign funders.  I'll forward the 
call-in details next week to the participants.

We will be reviewing the messages and potential audiences, and get a time 
line for deliverables from Public Strategies Inc.

Thanks to all of you for your consideration and support for this special 
project.

Regards,
Mark S.

Hi.  In case we don't connect, here's my general thoughts on the CEO  -- 
maybe I'm off base but you can gauge how the others feel and make a decision. 

Based on Jeff and Steve's meetings in SF, it seems we need to do a bit more 
development/advocacy work on the core/non-core proposal.  Maybe we need this 
week to get those ducks in order before pushing a letter out the door.

In the first paragraph-
It's written too much like our past two letters, a little too vague.  If this 
is truly the moment of floating a "solution" the letter needs to be more 
specific and more hard hitting.  Might want to mention the need to set 
politics aside and urge democrats and republicans to come together for the 
good of the state.....

Second paragraph-
First sentence is good. I think we're asking for more than just passage of 
legislation, which is why I think a letter might be premature this week.  
Also the other sentences are repetitve from our other letters. We need to 
explain and educate Ken's peers that a real, tangible solution is out there.  
It involves many elements, etc.

Summary - 
My suggestions would be as follows:  Download on Thursday's calls the 
meetings that took place in CA this week (with Ken, Steve and Jeff).  Figure 
out what still needs to be done.  Think about how the total solution needs to 
be shopped around and then send a very powerful letter to the business 
community.

Or....you can send another "legislative action letter" to the business 
community urging them to keep their eyes on the ending days of the special 
session and why certain bills need to be passed, please write everyone in 
Sacramento yada yada yada.

I don't like the second option because Ken has sent out two direct mail 
pieces already urging his peers to write letters.  Much of the feedback I 
received is that the CEOs are sensitive and not comfortable writing letters 
about legislation they don't understand.  

My suggestion is to hold on the letter this week.  Get a download from the 
guys on the meetings.  Get something tangible together and pull together 
(with the help of the CMA and Chamber leaders once they're on board) 10-15 
CEOs and meet with them to get them on board...whatever it entails to pull 
together the masses.  Once the team is together you take that to Sacto.  
Maybe that takes too long but I don't want to repeat what we've asked in the 
last two letters.  

Anyway, toss it around and see what the others think.

Below is the text of recommendations taken from the summary of 
recommendations in the Cheney Energy Report being released later this morning 
that focus on coal and coal-related issues, including environmental.

"The NEPD Group (National Energy Policy Development) recommends that the 
President direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) to propose multi-pollutant legislation.  The NEPD Group recommends that 
the President  direct the EPA Administrator to work with Congress to propose 
legislation that would establish a flexible, market-based program to 
significantly reduce and cap emissions fo sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, 
and mercury from electric power generators.  Such a program (with appropriate 
measures to address local concerns) would provide significant public health 
benefits even as we increase electricity supplies.

 Establish mandatory reduction targets to emissions of three main pollutants: 
sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury.

 Phase in reductions over a reasonable period of time, similar to the 
successful acid rain reduction program established by the 1990 amendments to
 the Clean Air Act.

 Provide regulatory certainty to allow utilities to make modifications to 
their plants without fear of new litigation.

 Provide market-based incentives, such as emissions trading credits to help 
achieve the required reductions."

"The NEPD Group recognizes the importance of looking to technology to help us 
meet the goals of increasing electricity generation while protecting our 
environment.  To that end, the NEPD Group  recommends that the President 
direct the Department of Energy to continue to develop advanced clean coal 
technology by:

 Investing $2 billion over 10 years to fund research in clean coal 
technologies.

 Supporting a permanent extension of the existing research and development 
tax credit.

 Directing federal agencies to explore regulatory approaches that will 
encourage advancements in environmental technology.

"The NEPD Group recomemnds that the President direct federal agencies to 
provide greater regulatory certainty relating to coal electricity generation 
through clear policies that are easily applied to business decisions."

"The NEPD Group recommends that the President direct the Administrator of the 
Environmental Protection Agency, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy 
and other relevant agencies, to review New Source Review regulations, 
including administrative interpretations and implementation, and report to 
the President within 90 days on the impact of the regulations on investment 
in new utility and refinery generation capacity, energy efficiency, and 
environmental protection."

"The NEPD Group recommends that the President direct the Attorney General to 
review existing enforcement actions regarding New Source Review to ensure 
that the enforcement actions are consistent with the Clean Air Act and its 
regulations."

"The NEPD Group recommends that the President direct federal agencies to 
support continued research into global climate change; continue efforts to 
identify environmentally and cost-effective ways to use market mechanisms and 
incentives; continue development of new technologies; and cooperate with 
allies, including through international processes, to develop technologies, 
market-based incentives, and other innovative approaches to address the issue 
of global climate change.

Subject: FACT SHEET: 21ST CENTURY CONSERVATION

                    21st Century Energy Conservation:
    "Pushing conservation forward will require investment in new energy
 technology.  And that will be a part of my Administration?s energy plan."
                  President George W. Bush, May 12, 2001

Next week the National Energy Policy Development Group (NEPD), chaired by
Vice-President Cheney, will make its policy recommendations to the
President.  Provided below are a few of the NEPD's recommendations to
promote 21st Century energy conservation.

Expand Combined Heat and Power Projects:
Because of their large needs for both heat and electricity, businesses find
Combined Heat and Power (CHP) systems particularly attractive. However,
replacing old, inefficient boilers with highly efficient CHP systems can
add a number of new regulatory requirements (such as air permits), without
offering the same depreciation incentives the tax code grants to power
plants.

Recommendations:
1.   Direct the Secretary of Treasury to work with the Secretary of Energy
and Congress to encourage increased energy efficiency through combined heat
and power projects by shortening the tax depreciation life for CHP projects
to 7 years.

2.   Direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to
work with local and state governments to encourage the use of well-designed
CHP and other clean power generation at brownfields sites, consistent with
the local communities? interests. EPA will also work to clarify liability
issues if they are raised at a particular site.

3.   Direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to
promote combined heat and power through flexibility in environmental
permitting to the extent permitted by law.

Provide Incentives for Hybrid / Fuel Cell Vehicles
Hybrid vehicles use power electronics and battery storage to get more out
of every gallon of gasoline consumed, and provide the ability to double
vehicle mileage.

A recent National Energy Laboratory Report indicates that the fuel economy
of a typical automobile could be enhanced by 60 percent by increasing
engine and transmission efficiency and reducing vehicle mass by about 15
percent. Several promising efficiency technologies are being presented to
the U.S. market. Automobile manufacturers are developing and have already
introduced hybrid vehicles. Advanced lightweight materials offer up to 6
percent improvement in mileage for each 10 percent reduction in body
weight.

Recommendation:  Direct the Secretary of the Treasury to work with Congress
to provide an individual, temporary, efficiency-based income tax credit be
available for purchase of new hybrid (gasoline/electric) or fuel cell
vehicles between 2002 and 2007.



Expand the Consumer Energy Efficiency Programs:
The Federal government not only ensures consumers have information on the
energy efficiency of major home appliances, it also promotes the most
energy efficient products in office buildings through the Energy Star
program, a joint program run by the Department of Energy (DOE) and the EPA.
Energy Star is awarded only to appliances that significantly exceed minimum
energy efficiency standards. The Energy Star program does not extend to all
products.  Energy efficiency would be further promoted if the Energy Star
program were expanded to a broader range of products.

Recommendations:

1.  Direct the Secretary of Energy to promote greater energy efficiency of
appliances and buildings.  Specifically,

    a. Expand the Energy Star program beyond office buildings to include
    schools, retail buildings, health care facilities, and homes;

    b. Extend the Energy Star labeling program to additional products,
    appliances and services; and

    c. Strengthen DOE public education programs relating to energy
    efficiency.

2.  Direct the Administrator of the EPA to develop and implement a strategy
to increase public awareness of the sizeable savings that energy efficiency
offers to homeowners.  The typical homeowner can save about 30 percent
(about $400) a year on their home energy bill by using Energy Star labeled
products such as computers, air conditioners and other products.

Addressing the Energy Deficit:
A Conflict of Visions
May 9, 2001

Dear Republican Colleague,

For the last eight years, we have had no coherent energy policy.
Former-Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson said last year in response to
rising gasoline prices, "We were caught off guard.  We were asleep at the
wheel."  Well it's time to wake up, and I think the Bush-Cheney
Administration is ringing the alarm bell.

        As we get into the debate over how to get out of this energy
deficit, it is important to remember that Democrats have long advocated high
prices to curtail your energy consumption.   Remember the Btu Tax?  I do.
The current crisis is the culmination of both a neglect of real energy
solutions and a concrete plan to restrict supply and drive up prices. 

This summer is the Democrat energy ideal, because it forces you out of your
car, to turn off your air-conditioning, and to dramatically change your
energy consumption habits.   Their plan calls for a fuel quota for SUV's!
To me, this exemplifies the difference between their vision and ours.

*       We're for modern technology solutions, abundant and affordable
energy, streamlining and innovation. 
*       They're for rationing energy, more government control, scarcity and
excessive sacrifice.

*       We're for newer, cleaner, more abundant sources of energy to fuel
our high tech economy.  Even traditional fuels like oil and gas can be
derived more safely, more cleanly, more efficiently.
*       They're for controlling your consumption and imposing new government
mandates on energy.

*       We're looking to the future and looking at comprehensive, reality
based solutions to a long-term problem.
*        They're stuck in the past and looking for Jimmy Carter solutions
that led to gas lines, stagflation and malaise.

To me the choice is clear.  We can recognize that we have a real problem and
look to real solutions, or we can stick our head in the sand, slap on a few
band-aids and falsely claim to have "solved the problem."  I choose the
former.

                                        Sincerely,



                                        DICK ARMEY
