Hey guys!  It's been a long time, I hope everyone is doing well especially since I know it's the end of bid week and it's Friday.  Just thought you might enjoy some of the things I've learned since I've been here about the English language.   Hopefully they'll give you chuckle.  

There are differences between British English and American English that I've noticed so far:

Pants are "trousers."  Don't make the mistake that I did:   I wrote, "Black Pants, Brown Pants, Khaki Pants" on my dry cleaning inventory to turn into the dry cleaners and got reminded that I was turning in "trousers" not pants with a smirk.  "Pants" are what they call underwear here.  Also, I almost fell over in my chair laughing one day when a girl in my group said "PANTS!" and hit her hand on the desk when her computer crashed.  Apparentely, it's the equivalent of saying "CRAP!"

I went to the grocery store around the block and I was looking to buy some orange juice.  On the outside of some of the containers it said "with extra bits" and some said "no bits."  I was puzzled until my boyfriend explained that it was "with pulp" or "without pulp."  

When I go to restaurants I have to remember that fries are "chips" on the menu (even at McDonalds), and chips are called "crisps."  If you want to get a baked potato it's called a "jacket potato."    And if you want mashed potatoes, just say "mash."  One of the favorite dishes at the pubs (not bars) here is "bangers and mash" which translates to sausages links and mashed potatoes.  

Here are a few more of the oddities:

You don't stand in line here, you "stand in queue."
Trash cans are "bins."  It's amusing to hear someone say, "I don't want it- just bin it."
Country boy or redneck types are called "wide boys" or "barrow boys."
When you spell things out loud, Z is pronounced "zed" and H is pronounced "haitch."
Cross walks are "zebra crossings"  since they are signified by white stripes on the road.  (Pronounced ZEB-bra, not ZEE-bra)
Panty hose are called "tights" regardless of their thickness.
Good  is pronounced "goote."
Yards no matter how big or small are all called gardens regardless of the fact that they're not growing any vegetables in them.

Well, I guess that's about it for the English lesson for today.  I hope you are all doing great and I'll try to do better about sending updates.

Cheers!  ( "Thanks")
Angie

Oh, Scott, I trully am sorry!  No, I'm at the office and I had only the one
message at home that the dogs had to go out when I looked.  I am so very
sorry!  Do you really think it's over?

Hang in there, as hard as it may seem, things will work out for you.

Love,

Well, how was your weekend?  Sunshine?  MUST BE NICE!! We still had cold,
rainy weather all weekend, but today we have SUNSHINE!!! AND our workers are
actually installing OUR plumbing!  AND we are taking a TRIP!!! They say good
things come in 3's, so I guess I have gotten my allotment.  Armin booked us
on a flight to London for Friday morning, returning Tues night.  We are
going to stay with Heather.  This is our first trip anywhere since the
wedding last May.  Since she hasn't been there but a few weeks, we can take
in all the sights together.  Now just have to find a dog sitter.

Armin and J?rgen installed all the electrical for the guest room and 2 doors
in the breakroom and bathroom over the weekend, so finally we are
progressing on the house...THANK GOD!

Well, can you believe it...my Melissa is 24 today.  incredibly.  And Tory
will be 6 on Sat! They are all doing good still, I am so happy for them that
things have worked out so great.

How is it going with your Mom?  Any luck with MD Anderson yet?

Well, gotta run...we are picking up some more doors this afternoon.

I can't believe you're going to put them outside!  100% of the TIME?  That
would be soooo difficult to do, I would end up letting them in, I have no
discipline when it comes them, with their sweet, sweet faces!  I do think
you are getting paid back for your lack of understanding for Barbara, it's
terrible when those kind of things come back to haunt you.

Which house is for sale, John's? Or that woman that never came outside?  Did
I tell you that they raised my tax value on the Roseland house for 2001 to
$231,000...what a joke!!! I#m sure that the purchaser will contest and win,
he only paid 190,000 and that is the fair value.  Are prices going down in
Montrose, what's the problem with the house by you, why isn't it selling?  I
would love to be able to buy a place that cheap...my land here cost $300,000
US!  The house alone here will be another $300,000 when it's
finished...incredible.  Armin has a small one bedroom apartment that he paid
$150,000 US for and we checked into selling it, evidently he bought when
prices had peaked...we'd get have that for it if we sell...so I guess we are
staying in the landlord business for now.  We just signed a new tenant, hope
she's not a problem, the others we've had were no problem.

I'm really sorry about the dog situation.  But what else can you do.  Oh,
what we do for love and lust!  I left everything and moved to Germany and
you're throwing your dogs outside.  Life has it's difficulties!

How's your mom?  What#s happening with MDAnderson?

That's terrible about your mom.  It sounds like she will have a very rough
road ahead.  I am so sorry.  We will be praying for her.  It must be
terrible too to have to wait to get into MD Anderson.  Please give her our
best and keep us posted, I am not familiar with that kind of cancer.

I'm glad you were a winner in Vegas.  When's your next trip?  We arrive in
Houston on July 4th, then go on the family vacation July 9 - 15 and depart
Houston on th 18th.  We were hoping to get together with you all the friday
after the 4th (the 6th??, I think).  Just let us know!

We have just spent the whole morning trying to install the wiring in the
walls of the break room for the internal vacuum system.  You have to run the
wires thru the plastic pipes that are in the walls and sometimes, like today
they just want go...so Armin had to destroy some of the wall.  It should
have only been an hour job, but it turned into 5 hours!  All of our workers,
except Claudia are on vacation this week, so we are trying to get some work
done on our house.  there's so much work and sooooo little time.

Now it's time for lunch...write when you can!

DTI will not be charging for TTT service through June 01, they will probably not start to charge any time soon, however they still have the ability to charge.  My feeling is that they will find it difficult to charge after providing the service for free for some time.  If they do start to charge by nom is there a way we can provide that service?  I will think about that one.

Well, I am sitting here in pain and bored.  Armin is having a meeting with
one of our building site architects.  the reason I'm in pain is that I
forgot to reach in HARD for the handshake...germans try to CRUSH YOUR HAND
when they shake, and unfortunately today I was wearing a ring and didn't
reach in hard 1st!  so my little finger is bruised...

Even if you don't have time to read the story below definitely check out the
photo at the end.  That is one DAMN BIG feline!


Now this is a Big Cat!

Mr. Degagne recalls how 15 years ago he befriended two stray young cats on the old AECL research facility at Chalk River. The kittens had appeared in late summer and apparently had gotten under a security fence around the old labs, abandoned since the late 50's. With the help of his tuna  sandwich, Mr. Degagne was able to coax the kitties close enough so that he could  pick them up. A self described animal lover, he did not want to place the kittens in the local Humane Society. Later that evening his wife Louise and their two children came to a family decision to keep the kittens which they named Lost and Found.  Lost was a female and Found was a male. When nature finally took its course, a litter of kittens was born 6 years later. One of the litter was a big white female with unique black markings on her side and tail.

Something about the kitten captured the hearts of the family, and while her siblings eventually found homes elsewhere, Snowball stayed with the Degagne's.  In her 9 years Snowball's size has seemed to snowball.  Put simply, Snowball is no ordinary cat -- she measures 69 inches from nose to tail and weighs in at 87 lbs.  She started out a big kitty and she just seemed to keep growing.  She always meowed for more food and would climb up on the counter to eat food which I forgot to cover.  Chicken is her favorite. 

"Once I left a cooked chicken on the table that I was going to use for a boat picnic, an hour later the chicken was gone," Louise said. We knew that snowball wasn't your average cat when the neighbor's German Shepherd ran yelping away from his first encounter with her.  She just isn't afraid of any animals.  After we found a half eaten raccoon out by the garage, we decided that maybe Snowball should be kept fenced in. We soon discovered that while we can keep Snowball in the yard, we couldn't keep raccoons from Snowball.  "At least it kept the food bills down," Rodger laughed. "Like all female cats she is very territorial, but with us she is just a big ole kitten," he said.
				
So what does a 87 pound cat eat? Snowball goes through about 3 lbs. of cat food a day, along with cooked chicken, supplemented with deer and moose that Rodger hunts in the fall.  She likes Pike a lot, so I don 't throw them back any more.  Snowball often accompanies Rodger fishing on the Ottawa, eagerly peering over the side of the boat as soon as his line goes tight.  So what do the Degagne's attribute Snowball's size to?  Rodger says "Well,the vet thinks it could be her thyroid, but she isn't fat, she's just a real big cat. I think maybe her parents got into something at Chalk River that they shouldn't have."
				
NOW go have a look at "Snowball."

 I am now the proud owner of 4 doors and 2 EVEN have door handles and
LOCKS!!! I can actually go to the bathroom in private now.

Bad news is, it's raining again. AND the farmer just spread liquid manure on
the field beside our office.  At least the rain should help keep the smell
down, I guess???

Hope your having a good week!

Connie and Angus (the boss is not here)

Oh, Scott, that is so great about your mom!!! But that is also soooo
interesting about thalidomide....I think of that drug alot here, because you
see the effects of the children here alot, well they aren't children
anymore...they are my age, but they are everywhere here.  so that drug works
on cancer?!?!?!? incredible!  does it have any side effects? (other than on
babies)

MMMM....liquid manure!  I hardly ever get that in the city!!!

I'm glad you'll be doing your business in private now!!!

By  the way, my mom finally got to see the doctor at MD Anderson yesterday.
They are going to put her in clinical trial where she'll be treated with
thalidomide (the drug that caused the deformed babies in the late sixties).
She starts that next week.  She had to promise not to have a baby!  That
should be pretty easy to live up to since she has no uterus and my dad's
been fixed!!!  Anyway, we're hoping that it slows things down, or puts it
in remission altogether.

Scott
