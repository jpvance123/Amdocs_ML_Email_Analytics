I have noticed that there is still a sizeable chunk of change in my bank
account.  Did you get the check?

How are you settling into things down there?  Stuff was pretty crazy around
here last week.  They cancelled classes on Tuesday and delayed them on Wed.
We also had many vigils and moments of silence.  A couple of my friends here
were directly impacted, in addition to one of my profs.  Not good.  Kind of
makes you feel like moving back to Canada.  Other than that, we have started
to learn some pretty cool things in our organizational behavior class, and
sharpened up our excel skills in a decision sciences class.  School is fun.

    (Adds more quotes, details, background from paragraph 4)
   MOSCOW, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov said on
Friday that domestic firms were set to propose cutting crude exports as part
of efforts to support world oil prices and that the government agreed with
their idea.
   Kasyanov was quoted by Russian news agencies as saying six or seven oil
companies would make such a proposal next week.
   "We will agree the companies take this decision themselves and will take
it into consideration in the work of the government," he said.
   Kasyanov added that the government "supported and could make corrections"
to proposals by oil firms.
   He gave no time frame for any cuts.
   His comments set crude markets jumping and came just hours after an
announcement that Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi would travel to Moscow on
Sunday in a bid to persuade Russia to support OPEC's efforts to stabilise
oil prices.
   Russia is not a member of OPEC and has in the past largely ignored OPEC
output cuts.
   Kasyanov said the oil companies themselves were to come to the government
with their initiative as the firms were suffering from weak prices for their
product.
   He said consultations between the companies and the Energy Ministry were
currently going on and that he would then hold a meeting on the issue.
   He said no special government order would be issued. "We will simply
agree with the rules of the game proposed by the oil companies," he was
quoted by RIA news agency as saying.
   Russia's economy is extremely dependent on revenues from oil and other
key commodity exports, which have helped fuel bumper economic growth this
year and last.

We are trying to establish your cost basis in your account.  Do you have
confirms from the purchase date on your securities so we can see when
the securities were purchased?  We need to know the date because of the
currency conversion.  Dale Onrait in Canada said you purchased the
securities from another branch so he does not have the records.  This is
for your benefit in determining your position if you sell the
securities.

Also, please contact Dale to sell your Canadian securities and have them
convert the proceeds to US$.  Tell them to send the money to us for your
account in Houston.

We still have not received your check.  Did you send it?

Let me know if you would like to grab a drink over the next 2 weeks.
Everything is slowing down for the holidays and my shopping to done!

Gentlemen:

I'm going to be in Houston for meetings on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.
Unfortunately, I have client dinners on both Tuesday and Wednesday evening,
but could still meet up for a drink afterwards, about 9pm somewhere.
Hopefully, this can work for you guys, as I'd like to catch up.

Please give me a call today at work, or else on my cell tomorrow.

Cheers,

hey John,

As a Blue Devil alumni, I have been able to do the impossible - actually was able to secure tickets to the Duke football game with some team from Georgia on 10/6

got an extra one in case you wanted to bring your girlfriend too!!

If you want to practice, check out the audio attached...

 
I'll see if we can crash my old fraternity's party as well!

Hi
Thought I would drop you a quick note.  I do not know if your mom told you but I went back to work just over a week ago.  Wal-Mart is opening a new store here so I applied and got a job.  We are in the process of setting up the store, shelves etc. plus stocking them.  Lots of work but I have a good partner to work with.  It took us about three days to find eachother but we work well together and make sure we head for the same area each day.
Winter is here.  We have about 4 inches of snow so far.  It is only about -4 so not cold at all.  Not much news other than going back to  work so will run for now.  Drop me a line and let me know how all of the mess in New York has been effecting you.
Say hi to Beth for me as well.     
Lots of Love   Donna

Do You Yahoo!?
Make a great connection at Yahoo! Personals.

Jon, I though I would check in and see how things are going down south.  I
talked to the boys in Calgary last week about the PSAC report, I guess that
they were going to the luncheon last week and wondering if they should anti
up the money for the report.  Other than that, I haven't talked to them
much, but can't wait to get home for Christmas.

Things have been pretty busy up here, I have spent a lot of time partying,
but even more time studying and working.  We have finals next week, then
have a week off, and start up again.  So far, things have gone pretty well,
and I have learned some pretty neat things (why Napster was an efficient
solution, why Microsoft included I.E. in their operating system...).  We are
finishing the accounting (thank goodness), and will be starting into capital
markets and more spreadsheet classes.  All in all, we have covered a lot of
the material that was in the first year of the CFA, but also learned a
little more about the softer subjects and case analysis.

The social scene here is pretty good, other than a definite lack of women.
Our class had one of the lowest female participant rates in history, and it
is starting to show on the faces of many of the single guys in my class
(myself included).  Four of us took a run up to Montreal on Friday for the
night, and it was a welcome relief.  Other than that, we can't complain too
much.  I started to play hockey once a week, and bought a ski pass that I
should be able to use in a few more weeks.

I am starting to think about what I am going to do next summer, and wanted
to talk to you about a few things.  I was considering a brief foray into the
consulting industry, and was thinking about a company in Boston that
specializes in the natural gas and power markets.  They have a pretty good
staff, and are very technical in terms of project valuations, and analysis.
I think that it would be a good, different background, but wanted to talk to
you (and possibly your girlfriend), about other types of work or companies
within the industry, including Enron.

Let me know when you get time to talk, and also let me know how things are
going in Houston.

Later.

You obviously forget the deafening tones of McMahon Stadium!!!!  Now that's
loud baby!!

Getting colder by the day up here....down into the low teens the last few
days, even had a bit of snow on the weekend.  Played hockey last night and
although it was my first time on skates in 6 months, I held up okay.  We
won 5-2.

Too bad about Notre Dame....I guess they're not the usual Irish powerhouse
this year?  Catch that Monday Nighter yesterday? (Skins/Cowboys).....didn't
think so......what a yawner.  Absolutely deplorable football.

Glad you didn't get me a Bagwell jersey, those bums couldn't do anything
against Brave pitching!  I just hope the Mariners come out of it all.....

I'm going home....more tomorrow.  We miss you too.....Scotty's not too big
on going to watch football.....

Jon

Sorry for the delay in getting back to you.  I talked
to your mom last night and we talked about the stuff
you have that is mine.  She was going to call you but
if she did not reach you here goes.

I paid either $1,600.00 or $1,700.00 for the three
piece unit.  I really do not care what you sell them
for just get rid of them the best you can.  Sell cheep
and get them out of your way.

Carol will look after the dolls and she will also keep
the mirror for me as she has the table.  She told me
that the mirror is broken but she will keep the frame
for me which is great.

How are things going.  Have you had people in to look
at the house yet?  Keep me posted.  Oh yes, when you
move back to Houston can I still reach you at this
e-mail address?  If not make sure to drop me a line
with a new address so we can keep in touch.

Is this going to be another promotion for you or is it
a lateril transfer?  Whatever, I wish you luck.

Won't keep you any longer as it is late and past my
bedtime.  Talk to you later.

Donna

Hi Jonathan, 
A couple of questions for you: 
1) Have you proceeded with opening an account at Dane Rauscher yet? 
2) Your RSP account has a small debit of $50.00, probably due to RSP holding fees charged to the account for 2001.  We either need a cheque from you for the $50.00 or we need to sell $50.00 worth of something to generate the $50.00 in the account.
Just drop me a note or call regarding how you would like to proceed.  Thanks.

By Michael Lewis 

Berkeley, California, Dec. 4 (Bloomberg) -- I'm not sure it matters anymore what anyone outside of a handful of regulators and prosecutors thinks about Enron Corp. The energy trader's fantastic collapse has the dimensions of a natural disaster, and may wind up being viewed by investors as an unlikely-to-be-repeated act of God. Too bad about that, since there are a few good general lessons to be had from the case. To wit: 

1) If the chief executive officer of a public company quits, he should be forced to explain why, even if it means -- maybe especially if it means -- professional humiliation. 

Bells should have rung in stock portfolios across the land when Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling said in August that, ``I am resigning for personal reasons. I want to thank (Enron Chairman) Kenneth Lay for his understanding of this purely personal decision.'' 

It's a bad sign for any big company when its male executives all of a sudden begin to care about their personal lives. Having long since abandoned any chance of a rich inner life, having shunted aside wives and kids for the sake of commercial glory, they are unlikely to experience any sort of inner awakening, unless they sense there is no more glory left to be had. 

When a CEO cites ``personal reasons'' for quitting his job, what he usually means is that he is being fired for creating a mess. ``Personal reasons,'' is second only to a desire to ``spend more time with family'' on the list of a departing businessman's excuses for evading questions he should be made to answer. When pressed by reporters, Skilling added, helpfully, ``my reasons for leaving are personal ones and I'd rather keep that to myself.'' 

The Enablers 

2) The most unsettling corruption is not in the souls of the people in charge of Enron but in the heart of the financial markets. 

The original idea behind the modern Enron -- to make markets in newly deregulated power markets -- is a great one. But the financial markets wanted it to be even better than it was, and encouraged the Houston-based company to grow into markets in which it had a lot less business being. 

In recent years there have been many examples of this. Take Amazon.com Inc., which was a good business so long as it remained a bookstore. Why the markets pay rather than punish exciting new companies for expanding into markets in which they have no place is a mystery I'll leave for others to explain. 

Big Difference With LTCM 

3) Spectacular financial collapses come in many shapes and sizes. 

Already the Enron collapse is being likened to the collapse in 1998 of hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management. There are more than surface similarities. Both companies were, to outsiders, opaque. In both cases their investors didn't understand what their money was being used to do. Both traded on their reputations for technical wizardry. Both made huge profits creating new markets, only to see their margins shrink as those markets became competitive. 

But there was a big difference between the two cases. The people at LTCM believed in what they were doing. John Meriwether and his boys fooled themselves as much as, and maybe more than, they fooled others. Right up until the end they acquired a bigger stake in their own business. When their business came a cropper, they lost most of their own money. 

The Enron bosses, by contrast, unloaded hundreds of millions of dollars worth of shares in their company before it went bust, making sure a lot of other people, many of them defenseless, were left holding their bag of crap. In any comparison with LTCM, they are undeservedly flattered.

A little summary of my travels so far!
 
 
After several e-mails back to myself, I believe I have figured out how to use this keyboard and the writing ?s hopefully readable {The poor grammar cannot be blamed on the keyboard though}.
 
On the plane over here, I met a turkish girl who used to be an english teacher, and hence spoke very good english.  I ended up staying at her place my first night in Turkey, she was going to give me a ride to my hotel but did not want to venture into the area in which the hotel was booked (don't trust everything you read on the internet!).  The plane got in very late, and I had not slept at all and was very tired.  A nice muslim priest decided to serenade me at 4:30 am from the mosque just down the hill, and my attempt at sleep ended.  Turns out muslims must pray five times a day, and the mosques blare out prayers to ensure that you don't forget.
 
  We had breakfast on the bosphorus the following morning, where I was able to learn a little bit about the traffic laws in Turkey.  We were eating across the street from a police station on a one way road, yet that didn't stop anyone from driving the wrong way down the one way!  They drive like maniacs here, and are encouraged as far as I can tell.  The traffic lights in the towns actually have a countdown timer on them, and the light goes from red to yellow to green, just like at a racetrack!  Go figure!
 
I got on a bus to head south, and learned several things about Turkish culture and myself!  First, very few turkish speak english (I had kinda assumed that they all spoke english after taking to an english teacher on the plane), secondly, I cant speak Turkish!  After a while, I managed to write down where I wanted to go and found someone to point me in the proper direction.  The buses here are awesome, they give you coffee and tea, cookies and some lemon smelling stuff to put on your hands.  Partway through the trip some army guys got on the bus, and a guy with a big machine gun came and sat down beside me.  He stunk but I was not about to tell him so!!
 
 I spent my first day touring the battlefields of Galipolli, with several Australians and New Zealanders.  The tourguide was awesome, and the site was really neat (although very few Canadians fought there).  I got back on a bus that evening and traveled to a town down south.  I met some New Yorkers on the bus, and they made me question my decision to go to school ?n the US.  One of the girls had no clue where Calgary was, until I explained to here that it was just north of Montana, it was the typical 'Speak American Please!'
 
On Saturday I toured the ancient ruins at Pergamum, which are located above the town of Bergama on top of a huge hill.  I decided after touring that I would walk back to town (about 5k),  wearing my big backpack ?n 35C heat!  After walking all the way down the hill, I got to the barbwire topped fence surrounding the ruins, I felt like an idiot but there was no way I was climbing back up the hill!  There were several young local guys running down the road, and I asked them for help.  There only suggestion was to jump the fence (explained by hand signals because they spoke little english),  and I figured it was worth a try!  I managed to get over the barbwire with my backpack and only cut up my knee a little bit.  They walked back to the village with me, and wanted me to pay for them to go to the other historical sites (I think?).  I took off faster than having being chased by an angry old man after snowballing cars, and hopped! on the next bus out of town.
 
Sunday I toured the ruins of Ephesus, which were really neat, and saw an old roman theater that Elton John had played in April.  Sunday I went up to the travertines at Pamukale, one of the seven wonders of the Ancient World.  The hillside is covered with calcium deposits, and there is water running down which collects in these pools where you were once allowed to swim (no longer because they were being destroyed).  Today I am sitting in a port town called Bodrum, and have just finished touring a ancient castle, and am heading to the mausoleum (another of the seven wonders!).  Following this, I am going to go to Marmaris and get on a sailboat tomorrow for a four day trip around many small islands in the Mediterranean Sea.
 
Hope all is well in Calgary, and will keep you all up to date through my journeys!
 
Jeff

Hi.
Glad to hear that things are moving along for you.  Believe me I know what waiting to sell a house is like.  It is nice to have ones own place but a pain in the butt when you are trying to move.  Anyway, GOOD LUCK, and drop me a note from time to time.
Love  Donna

Dear Jonathan:

Thank you for contacting Audi of America.  As there are few differences
between U.S. and Canadian models, moving between the two countries is
generally easy.  However, you should obtain a letter of compliance; this is
a statement by the manufacturer or importer that the vehicle conforms to the
destination country's standards.

You may request this letter from our Corporate Headquarters at the following
address:

Audi of America
Corporate Headquarters
3800 Hamlin Road
Auburn Hills, MI 48326

If we can be of any further help please write again.

Comments  : Dear Audi,

I have an A4 I wish to move from
Calgary, Canada to Houston, TX.  Other
than changing the instrument panel, do
you know of any other modifications
needed to do to import this car.  Also,
would you know which government agency
in the USA I need to contact to make
sure there is no problems bringing my
1998 Audi A4.

I have very much enjoyed my A4 and hope
to continue driving my Audi and future
Audi products when I arrive in Houston.

Any information or insight would be
greatly appreciated.

Best Regards,

Jon

Re: Production Area - South East La. Lateral Allocation

Due to operational constraints in Transco's production area, 
effective gas day November 28, 2001 and until further notice 
Transco will be limiting receipts upstream of Station 62 for 
delivery downstream of Station 62 to 450 MMDT/D.
All shippers affected by the daily capacity allocation will
be notified as soon as possible. 

Additionally, all shippers are advised to ensure that physical 
receipts and physical deliveries are in balance on a daily basis.
Also, per Transco's System Imbalance notice posted on 11/26/01,
all shippers should immediately work to reduce any positive 
transportation imbalances.


If you have any questions, please call Terry Fitch at (713) 215-

Hi
Thanks for the note.  It was great to hear from you and to know that all of the BS down there is not really effecting you and your fun.
My new address is:   Donna Ackert,  21 McPherson Road, WHITEHORSE, Y.T. Y1A 5S3.  Phone #(867) 456-2154.
You do not have to worrie about sending me a cheque.  It is not a big deal.  Just take yourselves out for a nice dinner or whatever and have a drink for me while your at it.  I just appreciate you looking after my Daultons for me while you could.
Work is coming along.  We are in the process of putting product on the shelves.  What a mess everything is in.  We have 24 days before opening and if we make it I will be surprised.  Lack of any sence of organization is a big problem.  All I can say is, I am glad that I am just a flunkie because if I owned the place Heads would roll.
The old bod keeps forgetting that it is six years older than it was in Summerland and just can't figure out why it is so pooped at the end of the day.  I really don't know how I managed 7 days a week, for weeks on end.  GETTING OLD IS NO FUN AT ALL.
Well best get for now.  Love to both you and Beth.
Donna

Well, my holiday has almost ended and it has been both enjoyable and
memorable.  I have met so many cool people over here, and seen so many
awesome places.

Since the time of my last writing, I spent five days sailing around the
Mediterranean with six other auzzies and kiwis.  The boat wasn't very full,
and we had four crew members to ensure the seven of us were adequately fed
and rested.  Morning started with breakfast, and was followed by long spells
of sleeping, reading and swimming.  It reminded me alot of Torys cabin,
except I didn't have to cook or clean the dishes (Tory, work on it...).  It
was difficult to get off the boat, and the group spent several days
afterwards laying around and doing next to nothing to ease ourselves back
into the real world.

After the sailing, we spent four days in this awesome little town called
Fethiye, and visited places such as the blue lagoon and hiked up to a
waterfall in the Valley of the Butterflys.  We also went to a hike in this
gorge, that was completely incredible.  At this point in the holiday, I was
quite happy for the lax safety standards over here, because we climbed up
many places in the gorge using nothing but the old ropes that someone had
conveniently tied in place.  In one spot, we even had to climb vertically up
a rope through a small waterfall!

I was quite pumped to head to this place called Olympos, where they have
these treehouses to sleep in, but let the others go a day ahead while I
finished my stuff in Fethiye.  When I got to Olympos, there wasn't much to
do and one of the guys was pretty sick, so I only stayed the evening, and we
carried on to the next place.  In hindsight, my decision to arrive late and
leave early was a good one, because I was the only one of the seven who
didn't end up getting really ill, whew!

We spent several days in this quant little village in the middle of the
country, waiting for everyone to get better to travel, then headed to this
place called Cappadocia, where they have these awesome hoodoo type rocks
everywhere.  After arriving, I went exploring some really old churches
carved into these rocks with a couple of girls from the hostel.  On the way
home, we decided that hitchin would be easier than waiting for the bus, and
met some really nice turkish men who were looking for a couple of nice
women.  After several detours and a long journey, we were able to talk them
into taking us back into town!  Last time I hitchhike in Turkey.

The next day, I headed off to explore the valley with the group of people
from the sailboat.  We got lost for a while, and found an awesome house
carved into this rock (kinda like a cavehouse).  It was many stories high,
and we went exploring and ended up on the roof of the house, which was at
the top of the valley.  I also got to sleep in one of these caves at the
pansion where I was staying, which was quite a treat considering the caves
are quite cool, and it was smoking hot outside!  The next day, we went to
take a tour that we had arranged through another hotel, and ended up getting
pulled over by the Jandarma (Turkeys version of the special police force).
Turns out that our guide wasn't certified, and that we weren't supposed to
be with him.  After a while of waiting, and some discussion, we were driven
back to town and refunded our money.  We ended up finding another guide, and
toured an underground city, saw some thousand year old churches, and saw
where they filmed some scenes of the first starwars.

Our final day in Cappadocia, and one I will never forget, was quite scary.
After a long hard night of partying in the Flintstones Cave Bar for my
sendoff party (the others were going another direction and I was heading to
Istanbul), we got up and decided to go for a hike down this place called the
pigeon valley.  There were five of us, including two other auzzies that we
had met the day before (four girls and one guy).  We hiked down this valley,
and ended up coming to a very steep section that we had to climb down.  It
wasn't very safe, and we were all pretty worried, but figured it was the
only way down.  The girl was crouching on this thin trail, and slipped.  She
ended up sliding down this rocky/sandy slope about twenty five feet on her
belly, and managed to stop herself on the edge of a thirty foot cliff, all
while the rest of us watched in horror.  A turkish guide had just shown up
before she slipped, and he helped to get her back up an to safety.  Myself
and another guy ended up climbing back up the rest of the cliff (we were
only partway down), and found another turkish guide who led us down an
easier way.  She was pretty shaken up, and had taken all of the skin off her
elbows, knees, and finger tips (trying to gain a hold).  We got her back to
town and spent several hours cleaning her up.  The two of them then came
with me to Istanbul, and hopped on a plane back to London.  Very crazy!

The last couple of days I have been in Istanbul, and have seen the Royal
palace, several really old mosques, and some amazing jewels (if you like 86
carat diamonds), and the bones of St. John the Baptiste.  I am going to tour
again tomorrow, and maybe shop a little, then head back home to Calgary.
Will see you all then!

Take Care!
Jeff

Hey Stephen,

Glad to hear the funds finally showed up.  It would be helpful to me if
we
could hook back up together in the next little while.  I'd like to get
your
opinion on a few different thoughts that I've had.  I need to do some
"financial planning" so to speak.

Let me know how your schedule is looking

Thanks,

Jon

Hi Jonathan, 
Our compliance department has just contacted us back regarding your request to hold a small cash account here to pay your RSP fees each year.  Their suggestion is that we sell the Janus mutual funds and convert this money to US funds then transfer it to your Dane Rascher account in the US because you are now a US resident and the Investment regulations want it handled that way.
You could simply send us a cheque for the RSP fees when we notify you each June. 
I hope you had a good holiday season, did you get home for Christmas?  Let me know by phone if we can proceed as suggested above and I will look after it for you in the new year.  Thanks.

Quite often we ask ourselves hard to answer questions,
like, "What is a sonofabitch? "

And we wax philosophic with metaphysical postulations,
incomplete aphorisms and inconsistent sophism that make
one more and more sure that the only true thing is that a
picture is worth a thousand words.

In the attached photo, the guy on the right is a member
of a bomb squad in midst  of  a deactivation. The guy behind
him, well, he's a sonofabitch.

Hi Jon,

Thought I would drop you a note to see how you are
doing.  I haven't heard from you for ages and was
wondering what you are up to.

If Beth is down for Stampeed say Hi to her for me.

We are slowly getting things sorted out and under
control around here.  We have all of the major inside
projects done and Ron is just about finished putting
up the fence.  This is good as they have just posted a
caution bear in the area sign on the mailboxes.  The
fence should keep them away from the house, I hope.

I sent pictures of the place to your mum so reminde
her to show them to you the next time you see her.  I
really like the place.  Lots of work to keep me busy
and out of trouble but not as much work as the house
and yard in Calgary.

Rons mum coming for a visit on 18 July.  Will take her
out and about in the Yukon and a couple of places in
Alaska.  I am looking forward to going on a tour
again.

Well should run for now.  All is well with me.  Going
to the gym 3 days a week and am working on quitting
smoking, again.

Lots of Love

Donna

Hi Jon,
 
Thought I would send that e-mail to Beth but my  computer says the address you gave me is not a valid address.  Maybe you  could e-mail me the correct one.  Anyway seeing as I am interrupting your  work day I might as well carry on.  
 
I sure do worry about you two, living and working  in what is sure to be a hot spot for who knows what.  You don't think you  could talk Beth into moving to Canada.  I know we are not safe either but  Houston is so far away and maybe  we are just a little  safer.  I watched Oprah yesterday and she had people in the know  on  about the safety of the airlines.  Those people said it is not safe to fly  so how are we to return to normal?  It is going to take months to train air  marshalls.  Are you sure you are going to Florida for  Thanksgiving?   What are the thoughts for Christmas?  Think about  Calgary,
you could have dinner with the family, visit your  friends and maybe go skiing.  The bad thing is you have to fly here.   Anyway you can let me know.
 
I talk to Grandpa almost every day.  He is  having a hard time.  He is very lonely.  I talked to the nurse at the  hospital where my Mum is.  She had a bad spell and was threatening to  commit suicide.  A psychiatrist evaluated her and prescribed some  medication because she is so anxious.
He said he thought she had vascular dementia and  not alzheimers because she was able to answer questions.  They were  not all the right answers but he said, a person with alzheimers isn't  able to figure out that it was a question and therefore respond.  She did  have radiation treatment long ago on the back of her head for cancer.  I  always wondered if damage was done at that time.  I'm telling you this so  you don't feel so threatened by the disease in the family.   Your Dad  was laughing and said: " Wouldn't it be scary if my Mum ended up being the  most with it of the folks ?"   I know life just gets more  depressing.  
 
I will send some pictures from Dad's birthday to  you soon.  I think we need to get a scanner and then it would be quicker  although I guess you go through a lot more cartridges when you print out  pictures.  Steve has gone to B.C. for his competition this weekend.   He doesn't have any aspirations of winning but says at least he did it.  He  got down to 155 lbs.  so made light weight.  I'm hoping he goes back  to real food but stays in shape.  
 
How is the squash game going?  Has Beth beat  you yet?  Are you still golfing?  We are pretty well done with   the golf but curling started Thursday.  Both Dad and Robert were away so  Joanne and I and two spares managed to get a win.  Joanne skipped and I  played second.  By the way, Joanne thinks she is moving to Toronto with  work.  She said probably Nov. 1st.  I guess Mirant bought the last of  Trans Canada Pipeline and so she and some marketing guy will  set up  the Toronto office.  I read in the paper that this makes Mirant only  second to the U.S. giant,  Enron.  Meanwhile Mirant was moving  into Eau Clair this weekend as they need more space.
 
I'm sorry I rambled on.   If you get  me the right address for Beth, I'll bug her next time.  Love to both of you  and please keep safe.
 
Love Mum

Jon, I have finally gotten my computer, and started our first day of orientation down here, things are going really well!

I was looking to get around 20000 worth of US$ sometime soon (things haven't seemed to be going the proper direction recently).   As far as I can tell, the bank is charging me around 200 - 250 points to convert my cash, anything less would be desirable!

If you don't have that much, I am willing to take whatever you have!

Thanks

Hi Laura,

I hope all is going well.  The reason for my note is that I was wondered if you can still do the occasional currency swap for employee's.  I'd like to convert C$300-400 thousand and was wondering if I could pay the Enron fee rather than retail.

Hit them down the middle,

Jon

probably sell very fast as it is in a great area and
it is a nice place.

You can just sell the cabinets of mine if you want.  I
don't have room for them and neither does your mum or
if you want just take them with you if you want them.
I just dropped a note to your mum to ask her to keep
the mirror for me as she has the table and I am sure
she will keep the Daultons if you do not want to take
them with you.  I know you may not as they are a pain
in the but to haul arround with you.

If you talk to Steve and he wants the TV cabinte he is
welcome to have it, but if he can not use if again
just sell it when you start selling off your stuff.

My new phone is (867) 456-2154.  I am going away
tomorrow morning and will be gone until Sunday
evening.  Ron's mum is here and I am taking her on a
little tour.

Anyway we can talk about this more next week if that
is ok with you.  Drop me a note and let me know.

Lots of Love

Donna

Jonny how's it going?  Just wondering how the living arrangements are so
far?  I'm sure it's all still very blissful being as it's only been 3 days.
Hopefully you guys are doing okay!

Wasn't sure if your email address changed or not....get back to me when you
have a minute, let me know what's happening!

If you bought $1000 worth of Nortel  stock one year ago, it would now
be worth $49. If you bought $1000 worth of  Budweiser (the beer, not the
stock)one year ago, drank all the beer, and traded  in the cans for
the nickel deposit, you would have $79. My advice to you is  to start
drinking heavily.

Things are going awesome down here, I spent all of last week rowing around the ocean (not as much fun as it sounds!), and spent the weekend with a couple of buddies in Quebec City (also not quite as fun as it sounds!).  
 
I can't believe the people that I have met down here, everyone is really friendly, and all have interesting stories/pasts!  You should seriously think about coming down here, I can't think of another place that I would rather be!
 
Anyway, I will let you guys know a little more when I finally get my computer, as I am using one in a common lounge area (right beside the pool table in my residence!).  
 
Any new information on currency?  I am probably going to have to think about converting it over pretty soon.

>
>11. On a road trip, the strongest bladder determines pit stops, not the
>weakest.
>
>12. While your girlfriend must bond with your Mates' girlfriends within 30
>minutes of meeting them, you are not required to make nice with her gal

>24. Never hesitate to reach for the last beer or the last slice of
>pizza, but not both. That's just plain mean.
>
>25. If you complement a guy on his six-pack, you'd better be talking
>about his choice of beer.
>
>26. Never join your girlfriend or wife in dissing a Mate of yours,

>         Nice Ass, are you a Sagitarius?
>
>28. Never talk to a man in a bathroom unless you are on equal footing:
>both urinating, both waiting in line, etc. For all other situations, an
>almost imperceptible nod is all the conversation you need.
>
>29. Never allow a conversation with a woman to go on longer than you are
>able to have sex with her. Keep a stopwatch by the phone; Hang up if
necessary.
>
>30. When a Mate is trying to hook you up, you may sabotage him only in a
>manner that gives you no chance of getting laid either.
>
>31. You cannot rat out a co-worker who shows up at work with a massive
>hangover. You may however, hide the aspirin, smear his chair with
limburger cheese, turn the brightness dial all the way down so he thinks his
monitor is broken, and have him paged over the loudspeaker every seven
minutes.
>
>32. The morning after you and a babe who was formerly "just a friend"
>have carnal drunken monkey sex, the fact that your feeling weird and
guilty is no reason not to nail her again before the discussion about what a
big mistake it was.

I know you  guys may be  still in the hiring mode.  I've attached 2
resumes
that are worth a look.

Beth Jenkins is a senior commercial person with extensive derivatives
knowledge and industry experience.  She has
a trading background but has interest in pursuing Origination
opportunities also.
 <<Beth resume.doc>>


Vickie Versen worked for me most recently trading physical gas in
the Gulf and previous scheduled on several East pipes.  I think she
has interest in considering either trading or scheduling.

TO WOMEN EVERYWHERE FROM A MAN WHO'S HAD ENOUGH:


1.) Learn to work the toilet seat. If it's up, put it down. We need it up,
you need it down. You don't hear us bitching about you leaving it down.

2.) ALL men see in only 16 colours. Peach is a fruit, not a colour.

3.) If you won't dress like the Victoria's Secret girls, don't expect us to
act like soap opera guys.

4.) If you think you're fat, you probably are. Don't ask us. We refuse to
answer.

5.) Birthdays, Valentines, and Anniversaries are not quests to see if we
can find the perfect present yet again!

6.) If you ask a question you don't want an answer to, expect an answer you
don't want to hear.

7.) Sometimes, we're not thinking about you. Live with it. Don't ask us
what we're thinking about unless you are prepared to discuss such topics as
navel lint, or the shotgun formation.

8.) Sunday = Sports. It's like the full moon or the changing of the tides.
Let it be.

9.) Shopping is not a sport, and no, we're never going to think of it that
way.

10.) When we have to go somewhere, absolutely anything you wear is fine.

Really.

11.) You have enough clothes. You have too many shoes.

12.) Crying is blackmail.

13.) Ask for what you want. Let's be clear on this one: Subtle hints don't
work. Strong hints don't work. Really obvious hints don't work. Just say
it!

14.) No, we don't know what day it is. We never will. Mark Anniversaries on
the calendar.

15.) Peeing standing up is more difficult. We're bound to miss sometimes.

16.) Most guys own three pairs of shoes. What makes you think we'd be any
good at choosing which pair, out of thirty, would look good with your
dress?

17.) Yes, and No are perfectly acceptable answers to almost every question.

18.) Come to us with a problem only if you want help solving it. That's
what we do.

19.) Sympathy is what your girlfriends are for.

20.) A headache that lasts for 17 months is a problem. See a doctor.

21.) Foreign films are best left to foreigners. (Unless it's Bruce Lee or
some war flick where it doesn't really matter what they're saying anyway.

22.) Check your oil.

23.) It is neither in your best interest nor ours to take the quiz
together.

24.) No, it doesn't matter which quiz.

25.) Anything we said 6 months ago is inadmissible in an argument. All
comments become null and void after 7 days.

26.) If something we said can be interpreted two ways, and one of the ways
makes you sad or angry, we meant the other one.

27.) Let us ogle. We're going to look anyway; it's genetic.

28.) You can either tell us to do something OR tell us how to do something,
but not both.

29.) Whenever possible, please say whatever you have to say during
commercials.

30.) If it itches, it will be scratched.

31.) Beer is as exciting for us as handbags are for you.

32.) If we ask what's wrong and you say "nothing," we will act like
nothing's wrong.

33.) We know you're lying, but it's just not worth the hassle.

John:

I did some investigating on the Canadian homesale piece and found out some
interesting facts.  First one and the most important one is that I will not
be handling that piece of the relocation.  Instead a young woman by the name
of Severine Jennings will be handling that our of our International
Department and her number is 800/241-6529 ext. 75910.  She specializes in
Canadian properties and will be the better person to assist you.
Secondly, there is a real need for you to use Royal LePage as the agency to
list your home and the reason is that they know everything there is to know
about the favorable tax treatment on sale of your home.  They know how to
handle the sale in the "U.S. way" and they follow all the strict guidelines
of relocation.  Severine will contact you to go over all this with you
tomorrow.

I will still be your contact for all othe aspects of your relocation.
Remember, Billie will call you tomorrow to get you wiring information for
your lump sum calculations.

Talk to you on Monday - have a great weekend.

I would love to do closer to 15000, but 10 will definately work.  I have
about 14000 in tuition bills due in several weeks, and need to definately
convert some money.  Why don't you choose a rate, and e-mail me the rate and
your address (work is probably best, although I don't believe I have any
cards here and will need the address again!).  I will rush you a check,
which you can cash and then rush me back a check.

I really appreciate your help, and will hopefully talk to you soon (we will
have to talk one of these afternoons, as I am generally around and have no
classes!).

How's about US$10,000 to get started or do you need US$20,000 right
away?  I'm not sure Enron is going to do the trade with me but I would
be glad to help you out.  Do you just want to mail cheques to each other
or do something else?  If Enron does the currency trade that I want to
do, I'd be happy to do what every volume you need.

Let me know what you want to do.

Yet again, I anticipated having a letter to email out tonight.  I'm almost there and just have to consult w/one other person to ensure we have everything in it we need for a smooth transition.  I believe I will accomplish that early tomorrow morning and will email it to you both and follow-up w/ a hard copy to you John.

The project has five "ear-in-the-sky" satellites capable of monitoring sounds from thousands of miles away. They allow Echelon to intercept virtually any internationally-transmitted phone call, fax, e-mail or data transfer for the ostensible purpose of tracking international terrorist groups or drug cartels. But unlike many spying relics of the Cold War, Echelon is aimed at surveillance of civilian communications, such as business and personal e-mails. Barr's office estimates Echelon intercepts up to 2 million transmissions per hour. 


http://www.fas.org/irp/program/process/docs/000219-echelon.htm
A former employee of Canada's security agency has charged that Canadian spies once managed to overhear the American ambassador to Canada discussing a pending trade deal with China on a mobile telephone and used that information to undercut the Americans in landing a $2.5-billion Chinese grain sale.

We will be spending our first evening together at the luxurious "Uncle
Bill's".  The website is currently under  construction, so it is
unavailable.  I think you are familiar with the accommodations....

Friday we will get up and drive, drive, drive to the "emerald waters" of
Destin, FL.  Our trip is approximately 582.9 miles or 10 hrs, 26 minutes.
We are staying at a Holiday Inn on the beach.  Please see
www.holidayinndestin.com for information on the accommodations.

Saturday we will lounge on the beach in the morning and then make our way
to hot and humid New Orleans for an evening of revelry.  The trip is 249.7
miles, or 4 hours, 52 minutes.  We will be staying at the International
House.  It can be seen at  www.ihhouse.com.

Sunday we will be in no great rush to leave, I need to find out more about
what the music festival is all about.  We will be staying at the Lancaster
in Houston, located at www.lancaster.com.  The drive is 5 hrs, 53 minutes
and approximately 347.8 miles.

Monday, we rest, but need to be around in case the movers come.

We will have logged 1,180.4 miles on the Volvo and spent 21.183 hours in
the car together....

Sung to American Pie

A long, long time ago.... I can still remember, how that stock price
used
to
make me smile, and I knew if I had my chance, I shouldn't have listened
to
those analysts rants, and maybe I'd be happy for a while..... but
February
made me shiver, with every option they delivered, bad news in the
Boardroom,
I couldn't believe the pending doom, I can't remember if I cried when I
read
about Skilling step aside but something nauseated  me from deep inside,
the
day, that Enron shareholders, cried. So...
CHORUS
Why, why did they throw a pie in his eye? Mortgaged the company to the
sky
then the bond market went dry and them good ol' boys were high on their
own
supply wailing, "Why Ask Why",  This will be the day that they  drink
Bud
Dry.
Did you write off your shares enough or did you have faith in Jeff
above,
if
the headlines told you so, and do you believe in book-it-n'-roll, can
mark
to market save your p&l and can you teach me how to print money on deal
flow? Well I know that you're in not in ruin I saw your balance in the
credit union, you sold off all your shares and I dig those market bears.
He
was a lonely boomer CEO with a big old House in River O.  but I knew I
was
out some dough, the day, Jeff stepped aside. I started singin...
Chorus

Now for ten years we've been on a roll and all are friends are on the
dole
but that's not how it used to be, when the Ken Lay sang for the George
and
Barb while Rice screwed Amanda in an rental from Harold Farb,  oh and
while
Skilling was looking down, the stock price has made him frown the
shareholder return, has really made him burn, and while he had plenty of
jack, he had lost the knack and had come under attack, , the day, Jeff
stepped aside. We were singin...
Chorus
Helter Skelter in a summer swelter the electricity market was a limit
melter, eight hundred bucks and climbing fast, California credit limit
had
quickly past, the governor tried to get some bills past,  Enron's
receivables have quickly amass, now everyone ran to  in Washington, the
lawsuits have just begun, just before the price would fall, Gov. Gray
bought
it all, as the dust is settling, will prove that government mettling
will
certainly be, a huge catastrophe, the day, Jeff stepped, aside. We
started
singin...
Chorus
Oh and there we were all in one place, a company that needed its space
with
no floors left to grow, so come on, Jeff be nimble, Jeff be quick, Jeff
S.
built a new deodorant stick because hubris the devils only friend, oh
and
as
I watched that tower build, but I doubt it will ever be filled, no more
recruiting trip; as HR doles out more pink slips; and as the building
climbed high into the sky to quite the contractor delight  I saw
shareholders shuttering with fright, the day, Jeff stepped aside. He was
singin...
Chorus
The burning question that I don't know is who can replace him as CEO
cause
the company won't be the same, he transformed the industry his success
is
plain to see but from natural gas to electricity, Dynegy tried, and
Duke
has dreamed but I hate to tease, they are just Enron wanna-be's, and in
hindsight its easy to mock his leaving the firm in a shock, I'm just I
had
sold my stock, the day, Jeff stepped aside, and they were singin...
Why, why did they throw a pie in his eye? Mortgaged the company to the
sky
then the bond market went dry and them good ol' boys were high on their
own
supply wailing, "Why Ask Why",  This will be the day that they  drink
Bud
Dry.

Dear Sir,

My name is Jonathan McKay and I am contacting you with regards to The Houston Society of Financial Analysts.  I have just recently move to Houston from Calgary, Canada and now find myself in need of sponsorship.  Just this past year I also completed the third exam and sponsorship will allow me to become a charter holder.  I obtained your name from a list of people that may be willing to sponsor new members and would greatly appreciate any help you could offer.

In order for you to become comfortable sponsoring me I have attached my resume and would also be willing to meet with you in person if that is preferable.  Also, attached is a copy of the sponsors document that contains a section that needs to be completed by my sponsor.  If you would be willing to sponsor me I would be very grateful, and if you are unable to sponsor me at this time any help you could offer as far as contacting other local members would be equally appreciated.

Thank you for your help.


Jon McKay

Awesome, I owe you many beers when I get back at Christmas (assuming you are
also home at xmas!).

You can send me the check to:
Jeff Pearson T'03
Tuck School of Business
316 Byrne Hall
Dartmouth College
Hanover NH, 03755-9000

I will courier you a check for the money on Tuesday!

If possible, can you please also courier the check to me, I have to pay my
tuition by the 10th and need to ensure that I have the money.  I will
include an extra 15 on the check to cover the cost of the courier!

Thanks

How about 1.5460 as the rate.  I'll just send you a cheque for
USD$20,000 and you can mail me the appropriate amount back.(Laura Scott
agreed to do the amount that I wanted to swap with her).  Where should I

John:

I did some investigating on the Canadian homesale piece and found out some
interesting facts.  First one and the most important one is that I will not
be handling that piece of the relocation.  Instead a young woman by the name
of Severine Jennings will be handling that our of our International
Department and her number is 800/241-6529 ext. 75910.  She specializes in
Canadian properties and will be the better person to assist you.
Secondly, there is a real need for you to use Royal LePage as the agency to
list your home and the reason is that they know everything there is to know
about the favorable tax treatment on sale of your home.  They know how to
handle the sale in the "U.S. way" and they follow all the strict guidelines
of relocation.  Severine will contact you to go over all this with you
tomorrow.

I will still be your contact for all othe aspects of your relocation.
Remember, Billie will call you tomorrow to get you wiring information for
your lump sum calculations.

Talk to you on Monday - have a great weekend.

Jon:  I am pleased to advise that I will be sending to your tomorrow, Friday, via Fedex, your L1A visa documents for you to work in Houston.  Tracking No. 8209-0167-6484.

Once you receive these, you will note that the letter from our immigration attorneys, Tindall & Foster is self-explanatory.  However, please be sure to allow adequate time at Pre-Flight Inspection to go through with your L1A documents to receive your I-94 card.  This will be your work authorization to work in the US.

Please let me know if you have any questions at 713-345-1529.

I've just sent the application for Jon McKay's Canadian Pension Plan / U.S. Social Security agreement whereby he will pay us his CPP and not have any S.S. withheld while working in the U.S.    His application is for the period August 22, 2001 to September 1, 2006 and will not be renewable after that date unless the 5-year limit is changed.

Normally the approval takes 4 weeks and I'll notify you (and send you a copy of the approval letter) so you can stop his S.S. deductions.

Many thanks,

Jonathan:

Thank you for your interest in becoming a member of the Houston Society of
Financial Analysts. The AIMR web site is your best resource for information
and forms regarding AIMR and HSFA membership.

The HSFA has two categories of membership: Regular and Affiliate. In short,
requirements for Regular membership are a college degree, the successful
completion of Level 1 and three years of acceptable professional work
experience. Requirements for Affiliate membership are a college degree and
one year of acceptable work experience. "Acceptable work experience" is
defined as a professional position in finance or accounting.

The HSFA holds weekly lunch meetings from September to May. The meetings are
at noon on Wednesdays at the Houston Club downtown, 811 Rusk. In addition,
there are usually three or four annual events in the evenings. After you
become a member, you will be alerted by mail and e-mail about every meeting
and event. For more HSFA information, check out
https://www.aimr.org/socservices/socpage.asp?society=HOUSTON .

To join the Houston Society, you also have to be a member of the national
AIMR organization. For AIMR membership, go to
https://www.aimr.org/memservices/join/apply.asp and fill out the Membership
Application Form.

The HSFA currently requires you to have three sponsors: your supervisor and
two HSFA members, one of whom must be outside your firm. (If your supervisor
is an HSFA member, then only two sponsors are required.) If you do not know
any HSFA members, there are people who have volunteered to serve as
sponsors. Attached is a list; just give one of them a call. The form that
your sponsors will need is attached. They may send them in directly to AIMR
or to you. At AIMR, your application package is bundled together and sent to
me for approval. I send it back to AIMR, and they will alert you of your
membership status (and invoice you for dues) by mail. The whole process can
take five weeks or more, because AIMR only processes applications once a
month.

Please call me if you have any more questions.

Guess what time it is everyone!?!?  It's.....

(Embedded image moved to file: pic05129.pcx)(Embedded image moved to file:
pic18711.pcx)



The Date: Friday, July 27, 2001
The Place:     3815 - 8A St. S.W.  Take Elbow Dr. South.  Turn right on
38th Ave.  Then turn right at 8A St. (just after                       the
school)  Any problems, call me at 243-7220 or on my cell 830-6113.
Bring:         Booze, swim trunks, music if you like.  Basically whatever
you want....I have some stuff.
Time:          If Friday is anything like what the rest of July has been
like, I figure an early afternoon may be in order            (right Bob?!?)
so anytime after that is fine with me.

Rub a dub in the tub!!

hey John,

As a Blue Devil alumni, I have been able to do the impossible - actually was able to secure tickets to the Duke football game with some team from Georgia on 10/6

got an extra one in case you wanted to bring your girlfriend too!!

If you want to practice, check out the audio attached...

 
I'll see if we can crash my old fraternity's party as well!
