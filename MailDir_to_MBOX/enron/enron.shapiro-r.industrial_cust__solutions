To alert you to another item that may arise:  Some industrials have air 
permits that restrict them to running for self-supply backup generation 
only.  In such case, the air permit may have to be amended by the industrial 
before it can sell to the grid.  Feel free to call upon Gov't Affairs if you 
have a question about this.

Subject: Interconnection: Easier for EPMI/EES to purchase from industrials  

*****Please note that with the authorization below, interconnection issues 
with the attached utility still need to be addressed.  (This includes 
agreement, queue, facilities if needed, etc.)  Call us if you need 
assistance.  Thanks.


   



Attached is FERC authorization for EPMI and EES to purchase power from 
industrials NATIONWIDE (effective March 6, 2001--Does not expire).  The 
industrial does not have to obtain its own power marketer license from FERC 
(subject to EPMI and EES making certain after the fact quarterlty filings for 
the industrials). 

Specifics:

Owners of generating facilities located at business locations and used 
primarily for back-up for self-generation (who will be "public utilities" 
subject to the Federal Power Act only while they sell at wholesale) can sell 
power at wholesale from such facilities to EPMI and EES without prior notice 
under section 205 of FPA (would usually require 60 day advance notice 
filing).  
  -- Waives certain parts of the filing requirements for the industrial; 
however, the industrial will still be subject to shortened filing 
requirements for dispositions of facilities and interlocking positions while 
they are selling at wholesale.
 -- EPMI and EES will make the FERC quarterly filings on behalf of the 
industrials for any of these purchases.  Our report must show the names of 
the industrial; aggregate amount of capacity and/or energy purchased from 
each seller; and the aggregate compensation paid to each seller.  
Accounting/commercial folks for EPMI and EES-- please make sure these 
purchases are flagged in the accounting system, since the report will be 
separate from our big quarterly reports.
 -- This does not authorize the retail industrial customer to violate any 
rules or tariffs of its host utility.  This does not authorize an industrial 
to resell power it purchases (only can sell what it generates); unless 
otherwise allowed (or not precluded) by its retail tariff.

West Desk:  This is similar to the authorization that FERC gave last week to 
purchases from industrials in WSCC.


____________________________________
On April 27, FERC issued an order granting EPMI and EES the authority to 
purchase power from IPPs at market-based rates.  As the attached order 
indicates, the effective date of the EPMI and EES rate schedules is March 6, 
2001.

On March 14, 01, FERC issued an "Order removing obstacles to increased 
electric generation and gas supply in the West.."  (Docket No. EL01-47).

 Most significantly, FERC authorizes industrials in WSCC to sell power to 
licensed power marketers (like EPMI and EES) effective 3/14/01 through 
12/31/01.  The industrial does not have to obtain its own power marketer 
license from FERC (subject to EPMI and EES making filings for the 
industrials).  (This is similar to the authorization that EPMI and EES 
requested nationwide earlier this year -- we should hear from FERC on that 
request by mid-May.)

In addition, FERC authorizes DSM sales at wholesale at market based rates.

Specifics:

Owners of generating facilities located at business locations in the WSCC and 
used primarily for back-up for self-generation (who will be "public 
utilities" subject to the Federal Power Act only while they sell at 
wholesale) can sell power at wholesale from such facilities to non-affiliated 
entities (like EPMI or EES) without prior notice under section 205 of FPA 
(would usually require 60 day advance notice filing).  
  -- Waives certain parts of the filing requirements for the industrial; 
however, the industrial will still be subject to shortened filing 
requirements for dispositions of facilities and interlocking positions while 
they are selling at wholesale.
 -- EPMI and EES will make the FERC quarterly filings on behalf of the 
industrials for any of these purchases.  Our report must show the names of 
the industrial; aggregate amount of capacity and/or energy purchased from 
each seller; and the aggregate compensation paid to each seller.  
Accounting/commercial folks for EPMI and EES-- please make sure these 
purchases are flagged in the accounting system, since the report will be 
separate from our big quarterly reports.
 -- This does not authorize the retail industrial customer to violate any 
rules or tariffs of its host utility.  This does not authorize an industrial 
to resell power it purchases (only can sell what it generates); unless 
otherwise allowed (or not precluded) by its retail tariff -- must file a rate 
schedule at FERC for this, but FERC will be receptive to granting waivers and 
authorizations.
 -- This authorization expires after 12/31/01.
Effective 3/14/01 through 12/31/01, retail customers in WSCC, as permitted by 
state laws and regulations, and wholesale customers are authorized to reduce 
consumption for the purpose of reselling their load reduction at wholesale at 
market-based rates.  These transactions can occur in several ways:  An 
aggregator can line up retail load to acquire enough negawatts to resell in a 
manner similar to what aggregators do when they sell power to retail load 
under retail choice programs.  In addition, wholesale and retail load with 
contract demand service could resell their contract demands if the value of 
power is greater than the value of consumption.  Similar quarterly reports 
would be due by EPMI/EES.
NOTE:  the industrial still has to obtain the interconnection agreement with 
transmission provider (may need new interconnection facilities, etc.) 
Remember that you still need to get transmission on OASIS when the power is 
wheeled away from the industrial.

Other initiatives in the order:

Utilities are encouraged to make DSM arrangements with wholesale customers.  
FERC waives the prior notice requirement for amended contracts that are 
required to be filed at FERC.
Clarifies that DSM should be treated consistenly with all other types of 
incremental and out-of-pocket costs for utilities.
Reminds transmission providers to keep ATCs current, including CBM and TRM.
Provides incentive rates for new transmission projects that can be in service 
by July 1 (and to a lesser extent -- by November 1 of 01 and 02).
Considers "rolled in" rates for generation interconnection (rather than 
direct assignment that we have now.)
Extends temporary waivers through 12/31/01 of operating and efficiency 
standards for QFs.  Allows QF to sell output above historical supply though a 
negotiated bilateral agreement at market based rates, if sold in California 
and the WSCC.
FERC will review interconnection issues that impede generation from reaching 
load (ie, if a utility does not act within time limits on interconnection 
requests, etc.)
Provides for increased staff and quicker gas pipeline additions review.

Please let me know if you would like the order.  Ray Alvarez (202-466-9170) 
and I (713-853-7007) can assist you with this.  Thanks.

Attached is FERC authorization for EPMI and EES to purchase power from 
industrials NATIONWIDE (effective March 6, 2001--Does not expire).  The 
industrial does not have to obtain its own power marketer license from FERC 
(subject to EPMI and EES making certain after the fact quarterlty filings for 
the industrials). 

Specifics:

Owners of generating facilities located at business locations and used 
primarily for back-up for self-generation (who will be "public utilities" 
subject to the Federal Power Act only while they sell at wholesale) can sell 
power at wholesale from such facilities to EPMI and EES without prior notice 
under section 205 of FPA (would usually require 60 day advance notice 
filing).  
  -- Waives certain parts of the filing requirements for the industrial; 
however, the industrial will still be subject to shortened filing 
requirements for dispositions of facilities and interlocking positions while 
they are selling at wholesale.
 -- EPMI and EES will make the FERC quarterly filings on behalf of the 
industrials for any of these purchases.  Our report must show the names of 
the industrial; aggregate amount of capacity and/or energy purchased from 
each seller; and the aggregate compensation paid to each seller.  
Accounting/commercial folks for EPMI and EES-- please make sure these 
purchases are flagged in the accounting system, since the report will be 
separate from our big quarterly reports.
 -- This does not authorize the retail industrial customer to violate any 
rules or tariffs of its host utility.  This does not authorize an industrial 
to resell power it purchases (only can sell what it generates); unless 
otherwise allowed (or not precluded) by its retail tariff.

West Desk:  This is similar to the authorization that FERC gave last week to 
purchases from industrials in WSCC.


____________________________________
On April 27, FERC issued an order granting EPMI and EES the authority to 
purchase power from IPPs at market-based rates.  As the attached order 
indicates, the effective date of the EPMI and EES rate schedules is March 6, 
2001.

Rick:  If the business guys are keen on cutting costs, this may be one area of discussion.  Maggy and I have met cordially with Competitive Analysis on several occasions, and asked that we avoid duplication of efforts.  I know this group has its own sources, and have been a good "data point."  However, these types of summaries clearly fall within GA, and having a special "source" is of no value (especially since I sent Maggy to the vote at the ITC).  I get the feeling that  they are more interested in "scooping" us than adding value in ways that we cannot.

Attached are filings made this week at FERC to seek permission for EPMI and 
EES to make certain FERC-required filings (including quarterly power marketer 
filings) on behalf of industrials with on site generation that sell power 
into the grid to us.  The filings will allow Enron to make it easier for 
these industrials to sell to us from their administrative filing viewpoint.  
We expect to receive authorization within 60 days.

Generally, industrials with on site generation are required to obtain a FERC 
power marketer license and comply with FERC's reporting requirements, similar 
to EPMI and EES' FERC filing requirements.  EPMI and EES will be able to file 
specific industrial purchases in a combined report, rather than requiring the 
industrials to file their separate reports with FERC.  

Please contact me if you plan a deal to purchase power from an industrial.  
We need to consider additional costs/back office transaction flags that may 
be required in order for us to track these purchases.  Thanks.  Christi  
37007.

Below is information about a FERC order allowing a power marketer, like EES 
or EPMI, to file to effectively act as an industrials "agent" when buying an 
industrial's excess power to insert into the grid.  Generally, an industrial 
would be required to obtain its own FERC power marketer license (takes about 
60 days) in order to sell into the grid.  EPMI and EES have not requested the 
"Impower" type agent authority yet, but I have been asked to file this for 
EPMI (and, Dennis, we could file for EES too, let me know). 

If FERC allows EPMI and EES to do this, then we would make quarterly filings 
on behalf of any industrials from whom we buy power at wholesale and they 
would not have to make their own FERC power marketer filings.  (Also, Enron 
generally has to also file for "EWG" Exempt Wholesale Generator status due to 
utility rules; however, if the industrial is primarily an industrial business 
in something other than power generation, an EWG determination is not 
required.)

I will keep you advised on the status of the filing(s) once made.

 
Subject: In Power Marketing --FERC order

On 3/30/2000, FERC issued an order accepting InPower's market based rates 
schedule that would permit entities that own generation to meet their own 
loads or for back up purposes (IPPs) to sell power at market based rates to 
InPower (on a profit share basis).  InPower made the filing stating it 
estimated that IPPs in MAIN (and, specifically, Wisconsin) could supply a 
substantial portion of the summer energy shortfalls (FERC did not limit 
ImPower to IPPs in MAIN).  InPower did not name any specific IPPs; however, 
to be eligible under ImPower's program, an IPP must control generation 
primarily for the purpose of meeting on-site demand or providing back-up 
generation and have such generation located on its premises or premises 
approved by the local utility.  Further, the generation must be capable of 
producing electricity either synchronous with the local utilities' grid or 
commensurate with agreements with the local utility.  Total sales made by 
IPPs in ImPower's program would not exceed 1000 MW/ hour.  The IPPs are in 
businesses other than the sale of electricity and are simply seeking 
"incremental return on the often-unused capacity of their generation assets."

When an IPP participates in ImPower's program, it becomes subject to FERC's 
jurisdiction as a "public utility."  

Jacksonville Electric Authority (JEA) protested ImPower's filing stating it 
allows retail customers to arbitrage retail and wholesale power markets by 
purchasing power at average, embedded cost retail rates and simultaneously 
using their generating facilities to sell power at wholesale to ImPower (at 
peak times).  FERC addressed JEA's concerns by saying that the IPPs cannot 
violate any rules and requirements properly imposed on the retail sales made 
to those suppliers.

This order allows ImPower (as an aggregator) to make the required quarterly 
filings for the IPPs and the IPPs do not have to apply for separate market 
based rates authority.  The are some additional reporting requirements FERC 
waived for the IPPs: accounting and reporting, issuance of securities and 
interlocking directorates (an affidavit is still needed). 

Please let me know if you would like a copy of the filing or order.

We were wondering if industrials would need to file "expedited" EWG filings 
in order to take advantage of the ImPower order and the FERC order on Interim 
Reliability measures issued Wed. (see separate email with details of relaxed 
filing requirements for industrials).

Per Dan Watkiss, if an on-site generator is wholly-owned by the parent 
corporation and is not owned by a separate generating company, then there are 
no holding company issues and no EWG filing is needed.  Therefore, this is a 
fact specific issue when we do an on-site generator deal, but in most cases 
EWG filings will not be necessary.

Per our conversation please find attached a brief introduction to Downstream 
Originations, the crux of our efforts, and a contact list.
We continue to benefit from increased contact with your staff, and look 
forward to working together on more projects.

Kindly amend if necessary and distribute to all concerned.  I have confirmed 
to Ginger that I am available to make a presentation at your June 8/9 meeting

Below are filings that EPMI and EES will make next week.  Once granted by 
FERC, they will allow EPMI and EES to perform some regulatory filings and 
functions on behalf of the industrials.  An industrial selling into the grid 
will still be considered a "licensed power marketer", but we can handle many 
of the tasks, thus making it easier for them to sell to Enron, rather than 
another power marketer that has not filed this application at FERC.

I talked to Kevin about this last night, and we discussed the fact that this 
FERC authorization WILL NOT allow the industrial to circumvent its host 
utility tariff.  Therefore, if the industrial is restricted from selling 
power from its on-site generator to the grid by the host tariff, FERC will 
not override that.  (FERC made that clear in the initial 'InPower" filing in 
response to a request from JEA.)  For example, several years ago at Jim 
Fallon's request, we checked the HLP tariff and found that it restricted EPMI 
from selling power to the grid from the generators in the Enron building 
basement.

While Kevin thinks that this can be a valuable filing, he is concerned that 
many utility sales tariffs restrict power sales to the grid from on-site 
generators.  In addition, Mark Dobler and John Berger are working at EES on 
distributed generation solutions and could be restricted from the optionality 
that grid sales provide vs. use of distributed generation on site.  

It seems that we may want to focus some state resources on making sure that 
the utility tariffs, especially in open access retail states, provide for 
maximum flexibility for industrial customers.  

Let me know if you would like me to visit with Mark Dobler about this or 
provide other assistance.  Thanks.  Christi

Here it is!!  This is the new GTC that we've been working on with Legal and commercial.  It's getting closer to a final product.

Subject:	New GTC (General Terms and Conditions) for use with EIM physical transactions

As some of you know, I have been promising that Legal would be rolling out a GTC for use in documenting EIM physical commodity transactions that are not governed by Master Purchase Sale Agreements or longer term Agreements.  Well, its finally ready to roll out, just in time for your light weekend reading!!

Currently the Steel Group confirms short term deals using a 12 page GTC and the Forest Products Group confirms deals using a 1 1/2 page GTC.  The attached unified form GTC represents a compromise between Steel and Forest Product; that is, its length is a miniscule 5 1/2 pages (excluding the Claims Procedure Appendices).  Aside for shrinking the Steel GTC and lengthening the Forest Products GTC, the new EIM GTC addressed parties' contracting rights if a Trade Event involving the imposition of trade duties or import/export restrictions messes up the economics of a Transaction.  As you all know, imports of Steel and Lumber into the U.S. are very sensitive issues that the Commerce Department, President and Congress are currently assessing and will act on within the next 5 months.  Legal has taken feedback and used it to craft a bilateral arrangement that acknowledges the effect of Trade Events.  Please let us know if this bilateral approach works for you.  

The new EIM GTC addresses, in greater detail, how parties must proceed making claims as to defective products (i.e., a Defect Claim).  While I have received helpful suggestions from Del Davis and John Daniel, this area is the one that varies the most widely between Steel and Forest Products (as well as within the various commodities offered by such Groups).  Therefore it is the area that needs the most input and work from logistics, insurance and others that deal with these types of problems.  Keep in mind that any solutions you make should have a bilateral slant to them, as EIM will be both a Buyer and a Seller.  Too hard a position taken either way will come back to haunt us.  But please give me your input in this area--the pertinent sections are 6.1(c) and the 2 Appendices attached at the end.  If we need more specialized Appendices for other Commodities, please provide me details for same.

Legal would like the Documentation Group to make a mass mailing of the new EIM GTC to all current and former customers next week and start using the new GTC late next week, if possible.  I remain available to take your comments, typo fixes, suggested changes, deletions, additions, etc. with the goal of finalizing this document by the end of the day next Tuesday.  Please help me to meet that deadline by reviewing the attached as soon as possible.

Finally, I will be forwarding a Short Form (1 page) Confirmation that Steel and Forest Products will be able to use once the new EIM GTC is implemented.  We'll be able to abbreviate the Confirmation because all the FCPA, Governing Law, Assignment and non-deal terms will already be built into the GTC. 

I LOOK FORWARD TO RECEIVING YOUR COMMENTS TO THE ATTACHED.

New Market Opportunity:  Industrial Hourly Sales

I was wondering if it made sense to discuss internal to Enron Government=20
Affairs the concept of opening the Large Industrial Market to eCommerce.  I=
f=20
we think this is reasonable, maybe we can make a pitch to the Enron NetWork=
s.

It is my recollection that the current regulatory rules related to customer=
=20
switching and marketer enrollment do not allow large consumers to buy energ=
y=20
on a less than monthly basis - there is no switching within the month.  LDC=
s=20
have historically prohibitied this to make sure that they were "paid" and=
=20
energy flows were in "balance".

To me, this regulatory "restriction" makes no sense at all.  First, big=20
consumers have the capability to buy energy hourly - staff and resources. =
=20
Second, big consumers need to be sure that they are getting the absolute=20
lowest price.  Third, big consumers control the load which if proper price=
=20
signals are provided can be used to reduce overall system peaks.  Finally,=
=20
the LDC arguments have always been ridiculous - they buy and sell energy=20
hourly.

To initiate this discussion, I was wondering if Jeff Dasovich and Lisa Yoho=
=20
could find out in CA and PA, respectively, if I am correct about the=20
regulatory "restrictions".  The other question, for Jeff Brown, is whether =
or=20
not we could construct a framework for Enron Online that provides for the=
=20
purchasing of the large customer full requirements (for example, metering,=
=20
data needs, etc.).

Does this make sense to everyone?  If I am way out in left field, let's not=
=20
do alot of work.  It just seems to me that we should try to migrate big=20
consumer load to Enron Online before competitors get into eCommerce.

It is becoming increasingly clear that the development of eCommerce will ha=
ve=20
a significant and continuing impact on the conduct of business in a broad=
=20
array of industries.  Through EnronOnLine, Enron has quickly become a major=
=20
catalyst for the transition to the web in the gas and electric industries. =
=20
EnronOnLine has been an enormous success since its launch.  Since launch, w=
e=20
have completed 67,043 transactions on line, with a total dollar value of ov=
er=20
$25 billion.  EnronOnLine is now the largest eCommerce site in the world.

We believe that the competitive success of EnronOnLine is due to one very=
=20
specific reason.  In addition to providing a web-based platform for=20
transactions, Enron acts as principal to provide direct liquidity to the=20
site.  We stand ready at all times, in any market conditions, to buy and se=
ll=20
at the posted price.  This converts a =01&bulletin board=018 (the more typi=
cal=20
eCommerce concept) into a true market.  There are very few, if any,=20
competitors that can provide this capability.

We are increasingly convinced that this competitive advantage can be=20
dramatically expanded to other products and other geographies.  If we are=
=20
correct, this could provide an enormous new opportunity for growth for Enro=

Accordingly, we are initiating a major new effort to capture this=20
opportunity.  Effective today we are creating a new business, Enron Net=20

be our fifth business segment, joining transmission & distribution,=20
wholesale, retail and broadband services.

Included in this business will be our entire IT and technology group along=

with significant talent and resources in market making and finance. =20
Initially, North America will provide primary direct support for staff=20
services and back office, however, over time we will be requesting support=

services from virtually all Enron units to ensure continued growth and=20
success.  To facilitate the combining of commercial capabilities with these=
=20
new eCommerce platforms, Enron Net Works will work closely with the merchan=
t=20
functions of North America, Europe, South America, CALME, Asia and Broadban=
d.

Enron Net Works will be headed by Greg Whalley, Chief Executive Officer; Mi=
ke=20

Officer.  These individuals will comprise the Office of the Chairman for=20
Enron Net Works and remain on the Executive Committee of Enron Corp. =20
Replacing Greg Whalley as President and Chief Operating Officer of Enron=20
North America is Dave Delainey, who will also join Enron=01,s Executive=20
Committee.

Global Technology will remain intact but will now be a part of Enron Net=20

as=20
an Enron global function.  Philippe Bibi will remain the Chief Technology=

EnronOnLine, headed by Louise Kitchen, will also remain intact and will now=

On 3/30/2000, FERC issued an order accepting InPower's market based rates 
schedule that would permit entities that own generation to meet their own 
loads or for back up purposes (IPPs) to sell power at market based rates to 
InPower (on a profit share basis).  InPower made the filing stating it 
estimated that IPPs in MAIN (and, specifically, Wisconsin) could supply a 
substantial portion of the summer energy shortfalls (FERC did not limit 
ImPower to IPPs in MAIN).  InPower did not name any specific IPPs; however, 
to be eligible under ImPower's program, an IPP must control generation 
primarily for the purpose of meeting on-site demand or providing back-up 
generation and have such generation located on its premises or premises 
approved by the local utility.  Further, the generation must be capable of 
producing electricity either synchronous with the local utilities' grid or 
commensurate with agreements with the local utility.  Total sales made by 
IPPs in ImPower's program would not exceed 1000 MW/ hour.  The IPPs are in 
businesses other than the sale of electricity and are simply seeking 
"incremental return on the often-unused capacity of their generation assets."

When an IPP participates in ImPower's program, it becomes subject to FERC's 
jurisdiction as a "public utility."  

Jacksonville Electric Authority (JEA) protested ImPower's filing stating it 
allows retail customers to arbitrage retail and wholesale power markets by 
purchasing power at average, embedded cost retail rates and simultaneously 
using their generating facilities to sell power at wholesale to ImPower (at 
peak times).  FERC addressed JEA's concerns by saying that the IPPs cannot 
violate any rules and requirements properly imposed on the retail sales made 
to those suppliers.

This order allows ImPower (as an aggregator) to make the required quarterly 
filings for the IPPs and the IPPs do not have to apply for separate market 
based rates authority.  The are some additional reporting requirements FERC 
waived for the IPPs: accounting and reporting, issuance of securities and 
interlocking directorates (an affidavit is still needed).  I do not know if 
the IPPs are still required to become Exempt Wholesale Generators (EWGs), but 
will check on that.  EWG approval takes 60 days (plus filing preparation 
time).

The Enron Industrial group may want to consider making a similar type of 
filing.  Please let me know if you would like a copy of the filing or order.
