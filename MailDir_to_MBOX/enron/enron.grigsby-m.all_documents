_____________________________________________________________________

The STOCK INDEXES were lower on Monday in subdued trading as many
players remained on the sidelines ahead of this week's economic news.
Overall losses were limited due to gains in chip stocks. Both indexes
are at important crossroads as they are challenging April's highs.
Multiple closes above these resistance levels are needed to extend
this spring's rallies. At the same time, momentum indicators are
overbought warning bulls to use caution as short-term tops might be
in or near.

The Dow closed lower on Monday but near mid-range. Light support came
from drug and cyclical stocks. Gains in Caterpillar, Eastman Kodak
and IBM also provided support for the Dow. Momentum indicators remain
bullish signaling that a test of February's high crossing at
11,035.10 is still possible this month.

INTEREST RATES June bonds closed lower on Monday as they extended
last Friday's loss. Expectations are running at 80-90% that the Fed
will cut interest rates by another 50-basis-points at its May 15th
FOMC meeting following last week's larger-than-expected unemployment
report. Today's setback was no big surprise giving last Friday's poor
close. Nevertheless, last week's breakout above this spring's
downtrend line signals that a short-term bottom and trend change has
taken place. Momentum indicators remain bullish signaling that
sideways to higher prices near-term are possible. If June resumes
last week's rally the 50% retracement level crossing at 103-20 is a
potential target.

The CRB INDEX closed lower on Monday due to weakness in grains,
bellies and energies. Today's decline turned a number of momentum
indicators including stochastics bearish warning traders that last
week's high might have marked a double top with April's high. Closes
below 212.64 would open the door for a larger- degree decline during
May.

ENERGY MARKETS closed lower on Monday due to profit taking that was
triggered by comments made by President Bush who indicated his
concerns over high retail energy prices. Additional pressure came
from expectations that this week's API data will once again show
stocks rose last week. Retail gasoline prices are running at record
highs, eclipsing last June's levels amid a series of disruptions at
refineries that feed the gas-hungry U.S. market.

June crude oil closed lower on Monday and in doing so turned a number
of short-term momentum indicators neutral to bearish. Closes below
last week's low crossing at 27.37 would confirm that the short-term
trend has turned down. I would not be surprised to see a steady to
higher close on Tuesday due to light short covering. Resistance
begins at 29.40 then February's high crossing at 30.13.

June heating oil closed sharply lower on Monday but remains within
last week's trading range. Closes above 77.80 or below 73.10 are
needed to confirm a breakout of a two-week trading range and clear up
near-term direction in the market. Momentum indicators are neutral to
bearish hinting that sideways to lower prices near-term are possible.

June unleaded gas posted a key reversal down on Monday due to profit
taking after falling short of testing weekly resistance crossing at
109.60. Additional weakness on Tuesday is needed to confirm today's
bearish reversal pattern. However, it will take closes below
trendline support crossing near 103-25 before a top and trend change
can be confirmed. The weekly ADX (a trend-following indicator)
remains in a bullish trend mode signaling that we could see
additional gains this spring.

June Henry Hub natural gas plunged below key weekly support crossing
at 4.38 on Monday due to expectations that this week's AGA inventory
data will continue to show natural gas supplies building. Today's
plunge below key support crossing at 4.38 has opened the door for
additional weakness and a possible test of the 75% retracement level
of the 1999/2000 rally crossing at 3.625 later this spring. The
rising ADX signals that additional weakness during May is possible.

CURRENCIES The June Dollar closed higher on Monday and above April's
uptrend line crossing near 115.27. Additional gains on Tuesday would
increase the odds that last week's correction has come to an end.
Momentum indicators are neutral to bullish signaling that sideways to
higher prices near-term are possible.

The June Swiss Franc and D-mark closed lower on Monday as they
extended last week's narrow trading ranges. Closes above April's high
or low are needed to clear up near-term direction in both markets.
Momentum indicators remain bearish signaling that sideways to lower
prices near-term are possible.

The June Canadian Dollar closed sharply lower and below April's
uptrend line on Monday thereby confirming last Friday's key reversal
down and trendline breakout. With this spring's rally stalling out
near the 50% retracement level of this year's decline and Monday's
trendline breakout, the door is open for sideways to lower prices
during May. Momentum indicators have also turned bearish signaling
that additional weakness is possible. I would not be surprised to see
a lower opening on Tuesday but would not rule out a short covering
bounce.

The June Japanese Yen closed higher due to a late- session rally as
the market continues to challenge the upper boundary of this spring's
trading range crossing at .8327. Multiple closes above this
resistance level are needed to confirm a breakout and trend change.
Momentum indicators are bullish hinting that additional gains are
possible.

PRECIOUS METALS June gold closed steady on Monday as it remains above
April's uptrend line but below the long-term downtrend line crossing
near 269. Momentum indicators have become overbought warning traders
that June gold is at an important crossroads. Closes above or below
the aforementioned support/resistance levels are needed to clear up
near-term direction in the market.

July silver posted an inside day with a lower close as the market
fell short of testing the lower boundary of this spring's trading
range crossing at 4.31. Closes below 4.31 are needed to confirm a
trading range breakout and trend change. Momentum indicators are
bearish but nearing their respective overbought zones hinting that
this spring's trading range may remain intact for the time being.

July copper posted an inside day with a higher close due to light
short covering as it consolidated some of last Thursday and Friday's
losses. Closes below last Friday's low crossing at 78.00 would turn a
number of short-term momentum indicators bearish thereby increasing
the odds that a short-term top was posted last week.

GRAINS July corn posted a key reversal down on Monday as forecasts
for increased precip across the dry eastern Corn Belt and a quiet
export market weighed on prices. Trading is likely to remain subdued
ahead of Thursday's supply/demand report. This afternoon's planting
progress report showed that 58% of the U.S. corn crop is planted
compared with 74% a year ago and 52% for the five-year average. This
will likely add to the selling pressure on Tuesday, as planting delay
fears will have been reduced. July's inability to close above broken
support crossing at 2.11 underscores the weak tone surrounding the
corn market at this point in time.

July wheat closed sharply lower on Monday following widespread rains
that fell across portions of the Plains over the weekend. Today's
breakout below trendline support crossing near 2.71 fell short of
testing March's low of 2.65 1/2. Closes below this support level
would renew the long-term downtrend while setting the stage for a
possible test of weekly support crossing at 2.50 later this summer. I
would not be surprised to see a steady to higher close on Tuesday due
to short covering following today's late- session bounce. Today's
planting progress report showed that 35% of the spring wheat is
planted compared with the five-year average of 50%. The crop
conditions report for winter wheat showed that 26% is rated poor to
very poor, 33% is fair and 41% is rated good to excellent.

SOYBEAN COMPLEX July soybeans closed lower on Monday due to increased
chances for rain across the eastern Soybean Belt this week. July
soybeans continue to hold above broken trendline resistance as they
extended last week's trading range. However, upside potential appears
limited in the face of slowing export sales, burdensome carryout
levels and increased U.S. planted acreage this year. If the rally off
the late-April low resumes, this spring's high at 4.49 3/4 is July's
next target. Momentum indicators are bullish but nearing their
respective overbought zones hinting that a short-term top might be in
or near.

July soybean meal closed lower on Monday due to light profit taking
and spillover selling from soybeans and wheat. Today's mid-range
close leaves the door open for sideways to higher trading on Tuesday
as last week's rally opened the door for a possible test of March's
high crossing at 160.50 later this spring. Momentum indicators are
bullish but nearing their respective overbought zones warning bulls
to use caution.

LIVESTOCK June hogs posted a potential downside reversal on Monday
but held above the 2000-01 uptrend line crossing near 66.75. Multiple
closes below this support level would confirm a trendline breakout
while opening the door for a larger-degree decline this spring.
Weekly momentum indicators have turned bearish signaling that
additional weakness near-term is possible.

June cattle closed higher on Monday as it extended last Friday's
late-session short covering bounce. Signs of rising boxed-beef prices
triggered today's rally. However, gains were limited by expectations
for steady to $1.00 lower cash bids this week. Momentum indicators
are oversold and diverging following last week's test of January's
low. I would not be surprised to see additional short covering during
the first half of this week.

FOOD & FIBER July coffee resumed this spring's short covering rally
as traders continue to build in a modest weather premium as winter
approaches in Brazil. If this month's rally continues, March's high
at 71.70 is July's next target. Momentum indicators remain bullish
signaling that additional short-term gains are possible this week.

July cocoa closed modestly higher in narrow trading as it continues
to consolidate above this spring's lows crossing at 955. Closes above
1034 or below 955 are needed to clear up near-term direction in the
market.

July sugar closed lower on Monday due to profit taking hinting that
the market might have priced in all of the bullish export news from
Asia at this point in time. Momentum indicators are very overbought
and turning neutral to bearish hinting that a short-term top is in or
near. If the decline off last week's high continues, trendline
support crossing near 885 is July's next target. Closes below this
support level would confirm a short-term top has been posted. If the
rally continues, this year's high crossing at 941 is July's next
target.

July cotton closed slightly higher on Monday as it consolidates near
the bottom of this spring's trading range. Trading is likely to
remain subdued ahead of this week's supply/demand report. Favorable
moisture conditions across west Texas and the Delta along with
burdensome carryout levels continues to limit gains in both old and
new-crop cotton.

Tom,

See the email below for the ID and password.

Call me on Monday to discuss the download process, if you should have any 
questions.  You will log into www.enrononline.com and I think you will need 
to download shockwave media (the site should walk you through this process).  
Once you have typed in the ID and password, you will then have the option of 
setting up a personalized quote page.  Also, call me about where to see our 
posted daily indices each day on the website.  Enron releases the weighted 
average of all gas traded at each physical point every day.

Thanks,

Mike

Are you planning to send today's bidweek deals soon? I just need to know

_____________________________________________________________________

June stock indexes close lower today. Prices are basically trading
sideways. The Nasdaq June futures are still within striking distance
of the April high of 1995. Sideways trading the past week has negated
a fledgling four-week-old uptrend on the daily bar chart. Bulls still
have some heavy lifting to do and their next upside objective is
resistance at the key 2,000 area. First support is seen at the 1,732
area. June S&P 500 futures closed lower. Prices have also leveled off
the past week, after rallying solidly off the early-April low.
Technically, bulls still need to push prices above the 1285
resistance area. My bias is still that any recovery in the stock
market and the stock indexes won't be dramatic, but a slower grind
higher, with fits and starts. First resistance is seen at 1285.00.
First support is seen at 1206.00.

LIVESTOCK: June live cattle closed $1.17 lower at 70.00 today. Ouch!
Prices gapped sharply lower on the daily bar chart and hit a fresh
eight-month low today. Reports that cash cattle traded $1.00 lower
today at some locations sent the futures market tumbling. Today's
plummet leaves the June futures well overextended, technically, on a
short-term basis. A corrective bounce is in order. The bears are in
full control of the market. Prices are trading way below an
accelerating two-month-old downtrend line on the daily bar chart.
Next support, basis June, is seen at $69.00. First resistance now
comes in at the $70.50 level.

August feeder cattle were pressured by the fat cattle futures and
closed off 75 cents today at $87.50. Prices closed near the session
low today and are now down in the lower portion of the recent trading
range. If recent history continues to play out, the market will
bounce up from the losses of the past two days. But if prices break
down below the bottom of the recent trading range, which is right at
today's low of $87.40, then the door is opened to a lower trend down
to the January low just above the $86.00 level. Next resistance is
seen at $87.80. First support is seen at $87.25.

June lean hogs closed $0.58 lower today, at $66.92. Prices are still
showing consolidation at lower levels, after the sell off last week.
Firmer cash hog trade today could not stave off the technical
weakness this market is experiencing. The bears have the strong
momentum on their side at present. Next support lies at $66.25. First
resistance is located at the 68.15 level.

GRAINS: July corn futures closed unchanged at $2.05 today. It was a
quiet "inside day" on the daily bar chart today, ahead of Thursday's
USDA supply and demand report and the weekly export sales figures.
Prices are under pressure this week after weekly crop progress
reports out Monday showed very good planting progress in the U.S.
There is just not much bullish fundamental news in the corn market
right now. It would not surprise me to see the commodity funds make
another significant downside assault on the corn and bean markets in
the near term. Next support is now seen at $2.00. Next resistance is
seen at the $2.07 1/2.

July soybeans closed 1 1/2 cents lower at $4.39 today. Prices are
consolidating the recent gains, but bulls by no means have any
significant momentum. Still, it does look like a minor bull flag
could be forming on the daily bar chart. Fundamentally, there is not
much in the way of good news for bulls right now. Thursday's
morning's USDA supply and demand report is expected to paint a
picture that is not bullish for beans. I would not be surprised to
see the commodity funds make another downside push in beans in the
near term. This market is still in technical trouble and it's going
to take a significant weather scare this spring or summer to force
prices solidly higher. First resistance is seen at the $4.45 area and
then $4.50. First support is seen at $4.35 and then at $4.30. Several
weeks ago, I purchased a July soybean call option with a strike price
of $4.80, for a price of 8 1/4 cents ($412.50). That option last
traded at 4 1/2 cents.

July soybean meal closed up $0.60 at $153.60 today. Prices this week
are showing consolidation after they pushed to a fresh eight-week
high last Friday. Recent price action is encouraging to the bulls and
is a sign the lows are in place in the meal market. Let's see what
tomorrow morning's export sales report shows. Next resistance comes
in at the $158.50 area. First support is seen at $154.00.

July bean oil closed 26 points lower at 14.83 cents today. After
prices saw a decent corrective bounce Tuesday, they sold right back
off today. This increase in volatility is consistent with a bottom
process in a market. Oil is technically much weaker than beans or
meal right now. But I would be surprised if there is much downside
left in oil. Next resistance comes in at 15.00 cents. Next support is
seen at the contract low of 14.76 cents.

July Chicago wheat closed 1 cent lower at $2.65 3/4 today. Prices
today touched the contract low of $2.65 that was scored yesterday.
"Rain in the Plains Makes Grain." That's a bearish refrain. With the
wheat crop behind schedule anyway, the recent rains could allow the
crop to make some good improvement. Bears are in full command.
Serious technical damage has occurred the past few sessions. First
support lies at the contract low of $2.65. Next resistance is seen at
$2.70. This market is short-term oversold and I suspect we'll see a
corrective bounce soon.

K.C. July HRW wheat closed off 1 cent at $3.22 1/4 today. Again,
rainfall in the Plains states has weighed on the market for several
sessions. A V-Top reversal is playing out on the daily bar chart.
Serious chart damage has been inflicted the past few sessions. For
bulls to get back in the ballgame, they need to push prices north and
fill the downside gap on the daily bar chart (created last week) by
pushing prices to the $3.34 area. That's a tall order right now. Next
resistance is seen at the $3.28 area. Next support is seen at $3.20.
This market is also short-term overdone on the downside.

SOFTS: July N.Y. sugar closed 10 points lower at 9.00 cents today. We
still could see a bull flag starting to form in sugar, on the daily
bar chart. This many times occurs as prices consolidate steep gains.
A three-month high was scored in July sugar late last week. The bulls
have good momentum and a steep and accelerating five-week-old uptrend
line is still in place on the daily bar chart. Next resistance now
comes in at 9.25 cents. First support is now seen at 8.80 cents.

July N.Y. coffee closed 100 points (1 cent) lower at 67.90 cents
today. Prices closed near the session low. Still, prices today
matched the two-month high set Tuesday, before backing off a bit. The
bulls continue to gain momentum. This recent move is the most
significant showing by the bulls since mid-January. The fact that
prices have not sold off sharply the past few sessions is encouraging
for the bulls, too--given recent price history. Still, the bears
could be setting a trap, like they did in early January. If bulls can
push prices above 70 cents and then see follow-through strength,
bears will begin to think this uptrend is sustainable. First
resistance comes in at 70 cents. First support is seen 65.00 cents.

July N.Y. cocoa closed $23 lower today, at $1,021. Prices pushed to a
fresh six-week high today, before selling off by the close and
closing near the session low. Tuesday's strong gap-higher trade on
the daily bar chart did put the bulls back on a level playing field
with the bears. Prices pushed above and negated a 2.5-month-old
downtrend line on the daily bar chart. Next resistance comes in at
$1,050--today's high. First support is now seen at $1,000.

July cotton closed 1 point lower at 45.43 cents today. Traders took a
"rest day" today after Tuesday's solid losses, and ahead of
Thursday's export sales and the monthly USDA supply and demand
report. Cotton is in a strong bear market, and a new contract low was
scored again today, at 45.36 cents. Right now, any rebounds are
likely to be just selling opportunities for the bears. But, my bias
is still that we are not that far from a bottoming process. Next
support lies at 45.00 cents. First resistance is seen around 48.00
cents. Would-be bottom-pickers should beware. Bulls need to watch for
some "basing" action, which may be beginning.

July orange juice futures closed 175 points higher today, at 78.70
cents. Prices closed near the session high today and filled an
important downside gap area on the daily bar chart. That's an
important first step for the bulls in turning this market around.
Next resistance is seen at 79.00 cents. Next support comes in at
77.15 cents--today's low.

July lumber futures closed $6.90 lower at $301.50 today. Today's sell
off is not unhealthy for the bulls. It was overdue. Prices just
Monday hit yet a new for-the-move high, at $313.20. Today's price
action is just some healthy consolidation in a bull market. Expect
more volatility, however, as is typical for this market. The next
upside objective for the bulls is the $315.00 area. First support is
seen at the $300.00 area. This market is still a bit short-term
overbought, technically, and I would not be surprised to more of a
downside correction in the near term.

METALS: June COMEX gold closed up $4.90 today, at $270.40. Prices
scored a big "outside day" up on the daily bar chart today, and in
the process pushed prices to a two-month high. Heavy fund short
covering was featured in the trading pit. This market is in a nice
uptrend since scoring its early-April low. Today's type of gain is
just what bulls needed to gain confidence to trek farther north on
the chart. Next resistance is located at $273. First support is seen
at $265.00--today's low.

July silver closed up $0.08 today, at $4.415 an ounce. Prices popped
on short covering and the rally in gold. Silver prices are still not
that far above the contract low. Prices are chopping at lower levels,
and this suggests a "basing" action that many markets need to change
the trend from down, to sideways, to eventually up. Next support is
seen at $4.33--today's low. First resistance is seen at $4.45. Bears
still have the advantage.

July N.Y. copper closed 50 points lower today, at 76.35 cents. More
stock market weakness helped drive this market lower again today.
Prices may still be attempting to build a base and recover from the
early-April low. My bias is still that the downside is limited for
copper. But the stock market and the U.S. economy will have to be
healthy before the bulls can really get something going in copper.
Next resistance is seen at 77.00 cents. Next support is seen at 75.00
cents.

ENERGIES: July crude closed $0.53 higher at $28.90 today. Prices
scored a mildly bullish "outside day" up on the daily bar chart, but
bulls and bears are still at a stand-off. Expect more choppy trading.
Next support is seen at 28.00. Next resistance lies at $29.50.

July heating oil closed 149 points higher today, at .7700. Prices
closed near the session high and bulls still have the slight edge.
But look for more choppy trading in the near future. Next support is
seen at 73.00 cents. Next resistance is seen at 77.50 cents and then
79.00 cents.

July unleaded gasoline closed 172 points higher at 1.0070 today.
Prices closed near the session high and scored a bullish "outside
day" up on the daily bar chart. Prices scored a new contract high
just Monday, but backed off sharply before the close and then saw
follow-through selling Tuesday. That confirmed a key reversal. But
given the recent volatility in unleaded, I am not placing a lot of
emphasis on that key reversal. Bulls are still in command as peak
driving season nears. Top-pickers beware! Next resistance is seen at
$1.03. First support is seen at $.9780--today's low.

July natural gas closed 8.3 cents lower at $4.27 today. Prices hit a
fresh five-and-one-half-month today. Next support is seen at $4.20
and first resistance is now at $4.50. This market is still short-term
oversold, technically.

FINANCIALS, CURRENCIES: The June Euro currency closed 10 points
higher at .8842 today. Bears have the edge as bulls have lost all the
momentum they had gained in mid-April. Prices hit a fresh three-week
low today. My bias is still that there is not much downside left in
the Euro. Look for more choppy action in the near term. Bulls will
again gain good momentum if they can push prices above the .9075
area. Next support is now seen at .8800. Next resistance is seen at
.9000.

The June Japanese yen closed 55 points lower at .8218 today. Bears
are still in control. Bulls are hoping for some "basing" activity at
lower levels, and that may be occurring, although it's too early to
tell. Next support now lies at the .8100 level. First resistance is
seen at the .8326 level.

The June Swiss franc closed unchanged today, at .5745. Bears are in
command. Still, my bias is that prices won't deteriorate much more.
Next support is seen at the .5700 level. First resistance comes in at
the .5830 level.

The June Australian dollar futures closed 87 points higher at .5234
today. Prices pushed to a fresh two-month high late last week and are
consolidating a bit this week. The bulls still have the advantage as
a five-week-old uptrend line is in place on the daily bar chart. My
bias is that the lows are in place. First resistance is now seen at
.5250. First support is now seen at .5100.

The June Canadian dollar closed 30 points higher today, at .6498.
Prices rebounded today after Monday's key reversal down on the daily
bar chart. Bulls lost some the past two sessions, but will gain it
right back if prices can push back north soon. Monday's key reversal
does not indicate prices are headed back toward the lows seen a few
weeks ago. What it does suggest is a downside correction to the
recent gains may occur over the near term. This currency had been
near recent historic lows and I do not think there is much more
downside. Next resistance is seen at the .6548 level. First support
is seen at the .6450 level.

The June British pound closed 48 points lower at 1.4200. Trading
continues choppy at lower levels. This currency was not that far
above recent historic lows and I do not think there is much more
downside in the sterling. One could argue that price action the past
few weeks has been a "basing" before prices eventually turn north. A
move above the 1.4500 level would be considered a bullish "upside
breakout" from the recent congestion area. A move below 1.4100 would
be considered a bearish downside breakout. Next support is now seen
at the 1.4160 level--today's low. Next resistance comes in at the
1.4300 level.

The June U.S. dollar index closed 2 points lower at 116.22 today.
Bulls have the momentum in the near term. The recent double-top
reversal on the daily bar chart still favors the bears longer-term.
Next resistance lies at the 116.50 level. First support is seen at
the 114.50 area. My bias is still that a near-term top is in place in
the dollar index.

June U.S. T-bonds closed 18/32 higher today at 102 5/32. Bulls need
to show some more resolve, after pushing prices well off the lows
scored in late April. A steep six-week-old downtrend line was
penetrated on the upside last week and negated. Also, a minor
double-bottom reversal has occurred on the daily bar chart. My bias
is that odds favor a strong upside move, as opposed to a strong
downside move. Next resistance is seen at 103 9/32. First support is
seen at 101 11/32 level--today's low.

The June U.S. T-note closed up 13.0 (32nds) today at 105.06.0. Bears
still have the slight edge. First support is seen at the 104.16.0
level. First resistance is seen at 105.20.0.

Hello Everyone

I have another poll for you. This week's question is....

If money were no object, would you pay 20 million dollars
for a chance to take a ride on a space shuttle as did the
millionaire Dennis Tito?

A) Yes

B) No

C) Undecided

D) What's a space shuttle?

In last week's poll, 55% of all voters said that they would
like to be chained to Sophia Loren, while 18% said they would
like to be chained to Mel Gibson.

Thanks to everyone for participating in my poll and don't
forget--today begins a new Mind Scrambler!

Keep those brain waves churning!

Janie

TODAY'S TEASE (#738) [Thanks to Jean-Francois A Borny for
sending in today's tease.

There's a box with a hole at each end and there's a rabbit
in the box. The rabbit sticks his head out of the hole in
one end, and a minute later he sticks it out the other end.
Half a minute later, his head appears at the opposite end,
a fourth of a minute later it appears at the end opposite
to that one, an eighth of a minute later...etc., etc.

How long will it take before the rabbit sticks its head
out of both ends of the box at the same time?

********************* Readers Comments *********************

Jane Barbe is the "time lady."  - my gosh if that isn't an
interesting fact, that I bet nobody knew the answer to.
Joanne

                            ****

I always wanted to know who the "Time Lady" was! I must have
dialed that number forty times in a week! I wonder if she's
the operator who goes, "The number you dialed is not working
at the present time. Please hang up and try again."?

Liz

                            ****

Barbe's voice is heard by millions of people every day
announcing ETC's Audichronc time, temperature, and weather
services.

In addition, Barbe's voice speaks for the telephone
network (changed numbers, disconnects, circuits busy), Bell
laboratory computers, The National Bureau of Standards, and
many voice mail systems nation wide.

Andy Lee
[I thought this was an interesting fact too. Thanks for the
additional information Andy. Maybe this will be a question
on "Who Wants to be a Millionaire" someday. Now you will
all know the answer. :)]

                            ****

If the answer was GREED I think DONALD TRUMP should be correct
also.  After all aren't those 2 synonyms.

Jeffrey
[Good point Jeff. Thanks for writing in. :)]

[And thank you all for writing in. I hope to hear more from
all of you in the future! :)]

Text of Gov. Gray Davis' energy speech
The Associated Press


   , , -- (04-05) 18:08 PDT Here is the text of Gov. Gray Davis' televised
speech on energy Thursday, as prepared for delivery:
   "Good evening. I'm speaking to you tonight from Sacramento on the most
difficult issue facing California: our energy crisis.
   "Simply stated, we have two problems: supply is too low and costs are too
high. Both result from the flawed deregulation scheme created in 1996. But
no matter how we got into this mess, you hired me to solve problems. And
that's what I'm doing.
   "The only long-term solution is to build more power plants. We must also
cut back on consumption and stabilize the utilities. But prices won't fall
and supply won't be truly reliable until we generate more power than we
consume.
   "Yet in the 12 years before I took office, not a single major power plant
was built in California. Not one. Since I became governor, we've licensed
12 major power plants. Ten more are in the pipeline. And we're doing this
without weakening our commitment to clean air and clean water.
   "Deregulation required the utilities to sell off many of their power
plants to independent generating companies. The generators are free to
charge whatever they want because they're governed only by federal
regulators who refuse to control wholesale energy prices.
   "This past winter, the prices charged by the generators shot through the
roof, driving the utilities to the brink of bankruptcy.
   "In January, with the feds still refusing to do their job, California
stepped in to purchase the power the utilities could no longer afford to
buy. We didn't take over to save the utilities. We took over to keep the
power on and the economy strong. That's not all:
   -- We also negotiated long-term contracts for electricity at vastly lower
prices.
   -- I used my emergency powers to seize control of low-cost power contracts
the utilities were about to forfeit to the generators.
   -- We began negotiations to buy the utilities' transmission system.
   -- We cut red tape and offered cash incentives to speed up construction of
power plants.
   -- We're launching an $800 million conservation program.
   -- We're moving to establish a public power authority to build more power.
If the private sector fails to build all the plants California needs,
we'll build them ourselves.
   -- And because I share your concern that the generators are ripping us
off, we're using every legal remedy to root out and punish illegal
conduct.
   "We can't fix 12 years of inaction overnight. But we're making real
progress.
   "Now, as you know, I have fought tooth and nail against raising rates.
It's become increasingly clear, however, that with rising natural gas
prices, the feds' failure to control costs, and the state's lack of
supply, that some rate increases are needed to keep our lights on and our
economy strong.
   "But I remain committed to protecting average Californians from massive
rate hikes. So I'm urging the Public Utilities Commission to adopt a plan
that will protect average consumers, reward those who conserve and
motivate the biggest users to cut back.
   "Under my proposal, more than half of you won't pay a penny more. For the
rest, the average increase will be 26 1/2 percent. For many of that group,
rates will rise only about 10 percent. The heaviest users will see their
rates rise 34 1/2 percent on average. That includes business paying their
share. This is in addition to the 9 percent surcharge we've all been
paying since last winter.
   "But all Californians can reduce their bills through conservation.
   "Here's the point: The more you use, the more you pay. The more you
conserve, the more you save. Conservation is our best short-term weapon
against blackouts and price-gouging. By flexing your power, you'll help
secure our energy future.
   "Unlike the PUC, my plan includes funds to restore the utilities to
financial stability -- if they agree to three main conditions:
   "They must provide low-cost regulated power to the state for 10 years.
Agree to sell us their transmission system. And dismiss their lawsuits
seeking to double your electricity rates.
   "My proposal raises rates fairly, assures us of long-term power,
stabilizes the utilities and promotes conservation.
   "Our emphasis on conservation is critical. In order to make it through the
summer, we must cut demand by at least 10 percent.
   "Already we've launched programs to cut back commercial lighting, and
reduce consumption in office buildings, schools and government facilities.
   "Friends, we have a power shortage but we are far from powerless. We are
34 million strong and if each of us does our part, we can minimize
disruptions and get through the summer. We are Californians. We've
withstood earthquakes, floods, fires, and droughts.
   "Yes, this mess is man-made, but with your help and God's blessing, we'll
get through this as well.
   "Thank you and good night."

Energy Commission Staff Completes Assessment
of Proposed Peaker Power Plant Project in Hanford


Sacramento - The staff of the California Energy Commission has
recommended approval of the proposal by GWF Power Systems Company for
a 95-megawatt peaker power plant at Hanford Energy Park in Kings
County.

The Hanford Peaker Project is a simple cycle, natural gas-fired power
plant proposed for construction and operation on a site immediately
adjacent to the existing GWF Hanford cogeneration plant, just north
of Idaho Avenue. If approved, the facility is expected to start
commercial operation August 1, 2001.

The Staff Assessment of this project can be viewed and printed from
the Energy Commission's Web Site at:

www.energy.ca.gov/sitingcases/peakers/hanford/documents

A site tour and informational hearing was held on the project on Friday,
April 20, 2001.

A Proposed Decision on the Hanford project, which will also be
available on the Energy Commission's Web Site, is being released
today.

The full five-member Energy Commission will consider the Proposed
Decision at its business meeting as follows:

THURSDAY, MAY 10, 2001
Beginning at 10 a.m.
California Energy Commission
1516 Ninth Street
Hearing Room A
Sacramento, CA
(Wheelchair Accessible)

The proposed Hanford Park Peaker Project applied to the Energy
Commission's emergency siting process to meet this summer's
electricity needs. The goal of the emergency process is to license
power plants that can be on-line by September 30, 2001, without
sacrificing the public's health or safety or California's environment.

Typically, peaker power plants are simple-cycle generators that can
be constructed in a relatively short period of time, readily
connected to the existing electricity transmission and natural gas
system, and dispatched quickly to meet peak electricity demands.

The Commission's Public Adviser, Roberta Mendonca, can assist
interested individuals and organizations and provide information on
participating in the Commission's emergency siting process. Persons
may contact Ms. Mendonca by e-mail at <pao@energy.state.ca.us>. For
information regarding proposed projects in Northern California, call
(877) 602-4747. For information about projects proposed in Southern
California, call (800) 273-4459.

Information about the proposed project is available on the Energy
Commission's Web Site at:

www.energy.ca.gov/sitingcases/peakers

The proxy price will be Gas Daily and Cantor Fitzgerald for Ca deliveries.  
How do we submit prices to Cantor Fitzgerald?  Anne, we will need to come up 
with  a cash report, much like our monthly index report for the 
publications.  Our data submitted will be under scrutiny at some point in the 
future.  It is important that all of our cash (one day) deals are reported 
accurately each day.

Please call me.  I believe I ordered a bloomberg machine only.  Does it some 
with its own operating system or is it offered through the network?  Please

Executive Summary:
? BC's NDP Leader Publicly Concedes Defeat to Liberals
? BPA seeks Federal Loan for Improvements, Future Fish Credits Limited  
? Washington House Extends Aluminum Smelters' Power Re-Sale Rights by 1,500 
MWs 

BC Elections
According to our information, the BC government is preparing for the Liberal 
take this week.  The election is slated for 16 May 2001 and it appears likely 
that we are looking at a near Liberal sweep -- they are currently leading 41% 
to 25% at the polls.  There is about a three-week lead time between the 
general election on May 16th, the Final Count on May 29th, and the Return Day 
on June 7th -- so there will be a period of jockeying around some issues.  
The New Democratic Party (NDP) leader, Ujjal Dosanjh, has effectively 
conceded the election in a public announcement.  Dosanjh is making public 
pleas to voters not to desert the NDP in favor of the Greens so that the NDP 
can retain official party status (4 seats).  Dosanjh has stated that he "will 
be happy if the NDP gets 10 to 15 seats."

The following are likely to be the key energy policy officials once the 
Liberal Party takes power in BC:

? Richard Neufeld, Minister of Energy, Mines and Northern Development 
(replacing NDP Minister Glenn Robertson)
? Dan Jarvis, Deputy critic on Energy, Mines and Northern Development Murray 
Coell, Minister of Environment, Lands and Parks (replacing Ian Waddell) 
? John Van Dongen, Fisheries Neufeld, Jarvis, Coell and Van Dongen are 
currently Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs).

While Gordon Campbell, the probable incoming premier, will have been 
effectively muzzled in the interim when it comes to talk about energy 
deregulation, the opposition will likely have plenty to say about it.  The 
people we'll need to be looking at this regard are:  Glenn Robertson - 
Minister of Energy and Mines, and Ian Waddell - Minister of Environment, Land 
& Parks.  

It appears certain that the Liberals will move to privatize at least some of 
the power crown corporations almost immediately.  They have promised a 
balanced budget and a chunk of  money to do it their way; they have made 
campaign promises about privatization to stir the economy; and they have 
tight back channels with the crown corporations' management who want "a 
straight privatization plan instead of coop approach to deregulation."  
Sources report that, if elected, the Liberals promise a referendum on land 
claims treaties with the local native Indians (or "First Nations").  These 
treaties result from overlapping claims to land and serve to block land 
development, forestry, mining, etc.  While the NDP has been supportive of the 
First Nations land claims process while in office, the promised Liberal 
referendum would seem to suggest that the Liberals intend to backtrack and 
not recognize the First Nations' rights.  In other words, there would be an 
increased impetus for mining and forestry.  This development is surprising 
since the Liberals have traditionally enjoyed strong Indian support, and the 
land claims process was originally started under a Liberal government.  If 
the Liberals press forward with a referendum on the process, there is the 
potential for violent flare-ups between the First Nations and the 
government.  (These flare-ups have occurred in the past, though not recently.)

BPA is urging the White House to increase its authority to borrow from the 
federal Treasury by $2 billion to build over 20 new projects for 500-kilovolt 
transmission lines and substations online between 2003 and 2006.  BPA 
officials hope the new borrowing authority will be included in a 
comprehensive energy strategy the Bush administration is expected to release 
next week, although federal officials have yet to give the final word on the 
BPA request.  Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, key members of Congress and 
the staff of Vice President Dick Cheney, who has taken charge of developing 
the administration's energy strategy, all have been briefed on BPA's 
proposal.  BPA has been building a case for a budget item that officials say 
would be a significant boost to the region's power infrastructure in the near 
term. If the administration doesn't include it in its energy strategy, BPA 
officials say they will nevertheless press for the increased borrowing 
authority in Congress.   BPA plans for the first time to use more "fish 
credits" than cash to meet its annual debt obligation, reducing its cash 
outlay by some $400 million.  BPA had expected its borrowing authority to be 
sufficient until 2006, but given the energy situation, BPA could hit the 
ceiling by 2003. 

BPA will be spilling water over its dams as a part of the salmon protection 
plan.  To make up for the shortfall, the agency will have to repurchase 
approximately $1.2 billion on the electricity spot market -- these costs will 
be passed on to energy consumers as a part of the subscription rate hike in 
October.  Oregon Governor Kitzhaber is pushing for more spills.  Steve Wright 
& other BPA officials are considering the effects of keeping water in the 
reservoirs as a safety net, should there be a cold spell next winter, which 
has precipitated a federal lawsuit from 12 environmental organizations 
against the National Marine Fisheries Service.

Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund is leading this charge, a coalition which 
includes Trout Unlimited and the Sierra Club.  The official line is they want 
to disallow the Federal Caucus and BPA from declaring a 'fish emergency' 
which would allow them to determine the amount of water spilled over the 
dams, among other things.  However, by exercising a 'fish emergency', BPA 
becomes qualified for additional federal credits - which is probably the real 
source of contention here.

Aluminum Smelters
The bill passed by the House Energy Committee  yesterday does extend the 
resale rights of the smelters to 1500 megawatts of  power beyond the October 
2001 termination date.  BPA is negotiating, even though they have no legal  
obligation to serve the smelters.  New attack ads paid for by the  aluminum 
companies are running to build political pressure to continue to  receive and 
resell 1500 megawatts of power beyond October 2001, in addition to  receiving 
other payments for staying offline.

Paige & Mark,

I went to Mike Grigsby's house to setup the DSL and Nortel connection but was 
unsuccessful.  When I tried to log in to CORP I got an error that no domain 
server was able to validate my password.  I went in and released the IP but 
got an error when trying to renew.  I verified that the card was installed 
correctly and that network properties were correct.  I then plugged straight 
into DSL and bypassed the Nortel box thinking that I could at least get that 
to work and then VPN into Enron.  That also did not work.  I spoke to SWB 
tech support for almost an hour trying some various things but was 
unsuccessful in those as well.  I also spoke to Mark Scott via telephone.

I was unable to ping the gateway...nor anything for that matter which led me 
to believe that there was something wrong with the line.  SWB said they were 
going to do some line testing from their end and would get back with Mike.  
At this point I would recommend sending someone out from Mark Scott's team 
that is more familiar with these setups than I am.  I do think it would be a 
good idea from someone from TSG to accompany them if they are able to arrange 
a time and then disseminate that information to the rest of the team.  

Regards,
KG

With ECS (Enron Center South) rapidly approaching completion, Enron is forced 
to change the numbering scheme on the existing Stentofon system.  To increase 
our capacity to support this expansion, we must increase the number of valid 
Stentofon address numbers.  Enron currently uses 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600 
and 900 series numbers for the addresses.  In order to add more addresses to 
the system, Enron will be converting the dial plan from a three digit dialing 
system to a four digit dialing scheme on the Stentofon system.  This 
conversion is scheduled to occur on the weekend of May 18th.

In efforts to minimize confusion, we will convert all Stentofon addresses in 
EB1 to a 4000 series number.    (i.e.  If your Stento number was 364, then 
your new number will be 4364.)  We will also change all speed dials to 
reflect the new dialing scheme.  Please instruct the users within your group 
of this change.


Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

Jay and Matt,

We should get together and build a gas consumption model for the new 
generation in the west.  We should identify the delivery point and then 
continue to monitor their status.  This will provide us with more information 
behind our Socal/Rockies spread. 

Thanks,

Grigsby

Anne,

I would like to check the index positions in the physindex tab in NCD.  
Please have all of the positions in the BasisTransport tab, section transport 
model, added to the phys index position totals.  Please look at the PG&E CG 
positions for May-Oct, I added the transport positions already.  I would like 
to add a KRS row in the physindex summary to account for the 20000/d 
transport that we have.  Also, please have the new transport index positions 
at Socal that we are booking tomorrow included in the new KRS column in the 
physindex tab.  We can review in the afternoon.

You are doing a great job.  I am sorry that I have not had a chance to thank 
you recently.  The market is distracting me.

Sincerely,
Mike

I think the Proxim solution is the way to go.  Compaq has partnered with
these guys.

You need: an ISA card for your desktop and a PC card for your notebook


Here is the link that gives an overview of the product:

Here is the best deal I found where they were in stock.  I believe you need
the last two items listed on the page.

I tried logging in to corp, but it failed because it prompted for new 
hardware - a 3COM card?  Should I get a phone number of one of the 
technicians, so that I may call them from my house when I try to log in.  

Also, the guys set up a hub for my desktop and laptop.  How do I have the

Network Neighborhood?

		Dear Mike,
		
		Washington Bureau Chief Jay Cranford is back in Washington, D.C. today.  He 
says next week will be a whirlwind with the unveiling of the White House 
Energy Task Force's National Energy Policy recommendations. President Bush 
will be in St. Paul, Minnesota on Thursday announcing the recommendations, 
and D.C. bureau's Peter Cook is getting ready to cover the event.  Peter will 
bring us reports next week. 
		
		Also from Washington, D.C. next week, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources 
Committee is holding a much-anticipated confirmation hearing for the two 
newest FERC nominees.  If the committee clears Pat Wood and Nora Mead 
Brownell, the full Senate could consider the nominations soon after.  We'll 
have more information on the hearing next week.   
		
		Houston bureau's Kim Benestante tells us the Panda Corporation is bringing a  
1,000-megawatt power plant online in June in Odessa, TX.  The new plant will 
accompany their Guadalupe County plant near San Antonio that's already 
online.  Kim says she'll also bring us details on a Los Angeles investor that 
is buying majority interest in Plains Pipeline.  Log on all next week for 
stories from ENL's Houston bureau.    
		
		Also next week, Houston bureau's Gale Smith is in Anchorage, Alaska covering 
the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission's Midyear Meeting.  We'll bring 
you reports from Gale in Alaska next week. 
		
		We have plenty more energy news coming up on ENL.  On Monday from our D.C. 
bureau, Editor of Downstream Energy Group Carol Cole is scheduled to join 
us.  She'll be live in D.C. to discuss the fallout from the Valero-Ultramar 
Diamond Shamrock merger.  You can catch Cole's comments in the 4:00 p.m. ET 
broadcast.  
		
		In the 9:00 a.m. ET broadcast on Wednesday, President and COO of Unit 
Corporation John Nikkel is scheduled to be in studio to discuss drilling.  
Log on all week to catch these and other interviews.   
		
		Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally 
guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep 
you updated on future interviews and events.

we need to pass on penalties to counterparties who cut us on gas day of may 
11.  many counterparties are swinging on eol deals, so  going foward we are 
going to rank those counterparties to take the cuts.  as far as this deal 
goes, the problems incurred were due to logistical issues.  we did rerank 
wild goose for cycle 4, but pg&e did not allow for renoms on this cycle.

 Matt

 I am passing on these penalties for non-performance Friday for the
firm volumes that did not flow.  The firm sales amount of which you did not
perform was  5000 mmbtu at $6.90.  Gas daily reported that the weekend
traded as low as $3.70.  Therefore, we are assessing liquidated damages in
the amount of US$16,000, the amount of which Lisa Feisst will invoice.  I
would like to ensure that this problem does not happen again. Wildgoose is
not the swing market, and all transactions completed on your screen are firm
as are all transactions, unless otherwise specified, with Wildgoose and
Alberta Energy Company.  We, at Alberta Energy Company consider this a
serious matter, not the dollar figure associated but the implications in the
California market place and are treating it as such.  Our companies have had
a longstanding relationship and we would like rectify this problem so we can
regain trading together in the future.  A letter outlining the above will be
sent to yourself  and John Lavorado for your records.

 Thanks

Subject: Cash books, etc.

I have been thinking about the cash book idea for group and I think we need 
to discuss this in more detail.  I would like to continue to use the physical 
for large prompt positions going forward.  I am afraid that the baseload 
volumes may not continue on their current trend if we break out the books.  
We need to discuss how the cash books would lay off risk.  i.e. Intra 
regional spreads with GD swap legs or spreads with other cash points and then 
booking out at gd mid to the internal counterparty.  Janie managing SJ and 
laying off risk on Steve's Opal.  I know that the cash books would be a good 
idea for dailies , but I am not sure how to do this without giving up the 
cash risk for baseload as well.  What are your thoughts?

I would also like to discuss the staffing issues.  Matt Smith and Susan Scott 
to analyst,  Jay to the ROX, etc.  It seems like Ken S. has shown more 
interest in the west fundies lately.  Should we keep his services?

The basis products need another book.  Who can we add to the mix?  I think 
that we should look into having Frank focus on prompt month only.  He has a 
great interest in cash and fundies and this should serve him well in managing 
tight two ways for all products on the prompt.  Keith can do term with 
another book.

Monique is going to take over the gd swaps for Kern, SJ, and Perm.  I will 
continue to manage the CA products.  This should allow us to provide tighter 
two ways across the west. I will continue to manage all index products and 
prompt month phys fixed price.

Operations needs more labor as well as an analyst or two to monitor flows.  
The analysts will monitor flows by price and hopefully find creative ways to 
nom the market.

EOL.  Keith has a great idea of opening up all products to the desk so that 
you may insert a bid or an offer inside of the manager's markets.  We should 
propose this to EOL.  This would allow for tighter markets on all products 
and prevent the desk from working markets through the brokers.

Ca cash products.  Let's call a meeting about how to offer more Socal 
physical products.  I would like to have PG&E topock and Socal Ehrenberg 
before the summer.  


Mike

Reuters has not permissioned the Inside Ferc this is how you can get to the 
page once it is permissioned.  I have called them several times to have it 
turned on and they assure me that they are working on it.  


The following is how to launch Inside F.E.R.C'S Natural Gas Alert:

1.  Launch Telerate 
2.  Click on Pages application  
3.  click on Data 
4.  click on Sources 
5.  verify RSFPages has a check by it, if it doesn't click on it.
6.  type PGNINDEX this will bring you to the Inside FERC Natural Gas Alert 
Speed Guide

Mark,  

Please describe in detail, the downstream capacity available to transport 
this gas.  How does the CIG capacity being sold to Coastal impact this 
point?  If you can make the case for this gas flowing without constraint, 
then I see no problem in making a fixed price bid for the full volume.

A rough sketch of the gas location and its downstream flow options would be 
nice. 

Thanks,

Mike

My address is 6201 Meadow Lake 77057 and my home phone is 713-780-1022.  The 
horns looked great last week.  Chris Simms is alive.  The best quarterback 
performance I have ever seen in Memorial stadium since Peter the Great.  Just 
think if we had Phil Brown running the ball.

I have asked Bob Badeer to help us research what the utilization rate of gas 
fired plants in the west was last year and what, if any, the impact of lower 
hydro and even warmer temps would mean to gas consumption in 2001.  We need 
to account for any political changes in air pollution credits this year that 
may increase gas consumption in 2001.  

Let's discuss in the afternoon. 3:30 meeting.

The index products look great.  Can you have the same constraint language 
included on the PG&E Topock location for creating the phys forward (fixed 
price) product?  Let me know when that is done.

Thank you.

Hello Everyone

Yet another week is drawing to a close. I am very excited
about this weekend. Saturday my older brother is graduating
from college with a Bachelor's Degree in Psychology. He has
worked very hard for this and I am very proud of him. Also,
with Sunday being Mother's Day, we are going to have a cook
out at my boyfriend's uncle's house to celebrate. It should
be a lot of fun. I would like to wish all of you mothers
out there a wonderful day and to let you know how much I
respect you for the awesome jobs you are doing raising your
families. I hope that one day I can be a part of such an
elite and incredible group of individuals. :)

Keep those brain waves churning!

Janie

Hi Jane,

You were right, I just had to prove Lateral Larry wrong.  I
immediately thought of tSUNami as a correct answer also (the
Christian holiday reference was supposed to be a hint for
the "only one logical solution" and not meant to additionally
limit the answers).  I figured there must be others too, and
did a quick search.  There are at least  190 more "correct
answers".  Some of them are:

sunup, suntan, (all other sun... compound words too), sunnah,
sunn, sunk, Velsuna, Utsunomiya, sung, sunder, sundae, misun-
derstood, Asuncion, asunder, bosun, disunion, gesundheit,

Keep up the good work Jane!  Also, I'm still waiting on your
reply to my proposal (since your boyfriend hasn't proposed yet,
what are you waiting for????  LOL).

Guy
[I will give him the benefit of the doubt for now, but I
will let you know if anything happens. lol Thanks for the
info, I knew you guys would not let me down. :)]

                            ****

It is interesting that suede is spelled with a "w" instead
of a "u" in the States.  I have never seen it spelled that
way before, so I guess it must be a regional (albeit country
wide) thing, like how you Americans misspell neighboUr,
tomatoE, potatoE, coloUr, etc (LOL).   Seriously, though, I
thought it was a typo because that is not how it is spelled
in countries outside of the US (like so many other words,
including the above examples).  Because I thought it was a
typo, I just spelled it "correctly" mentally, and so was
unable to solve the puzzle (not like I'd have solved it had
I known though).  Have a good day and keep up with the good
work that you do.

Darlene
["The Mammoth Puzzle Carnival" was actually published in
England so forgive me for the foreign spellings. It is
getting harder and harder to find original material to
baffle and bamboozle all of you. But I will keep trying.]

                            ****

Janie,

Keep dreaming ... that's what it's all about ...

and ... the lottery is only the little picture!

All the best,
KAD
[And the best to you as well. As in the moral words
of Casey Kasem, "Keep your feet in the ground and keep
reaching for the stars."]

                            ****

For Leland re: Jane Barbe and the time announcements.

Am sure the tape (or whatever) was not made in one sitting.
Her male predecessor recorded, took a break, recorded some
more, until the entire twelve hours was on tape, then the
tape was electronically edited to synchronize it with the
atomic clock. Regardless, she IS good at what she does!!
Lloyd
[Thanks Lloyd, I am sure you are right and that tape was not
made in one sitting. And she is great at what she does, just
like I am sure all of you are great at what you do! :)]

[And thank you all for writing in. I hope to hear more from
all of you in the future! :)]

I received an email this morning regarding the reports viewer.  I agree with 
restriciting the access to these sensitive reports, but I don't agree with 
removing myself from those allowed to review positions.  I not only run one 
of the largest financial books on the floor, but I also manage the West 
physical book.  Phillip Allen passed on the IM WEST physical book to me two 
months ago.  While Phillip acts as manager of the sub books in the west, I am 
managing all physical positions.

Take a look at the rates for Cayman.  We should try to get a corporate 
conference rate.  I will have Ina look into that possibility.  Cancun is not 
an option in March and April - all booked.

_____________________________________________________________________

June Nasdaq futures weaker today. Prices are trading sideways but are
still within striking distance of the April high of 1995. Sideways
trading the past week has negated a fledgling four-week-old uptrend
on the daily bar chart. Bulls still have some heavy lifting to do and
their next upside objective is resistance at the key 2,000 area.
First support is seen at the 1,732 area.

June S&P 500 futures closed firmer today. Prices have leveled off the
past week, after rallying solidly off the early-April low.
Technically, bulls still need to push prices above the 1285
resistance area. My bias is still that any recovery in the stock
market and the stock indexes won't be dramatic, but a slower grind
higher, with fits and starts. First resistance is seen at 1285.00.
First support is seen at 1206.00.

LIVESTOCK: June live cattle closed $0.28 higher at 70.25 today.
Prices scored a consolidative "inside" day on the daily bar chart
today. On Wednesday, prices gapped sharply lower and hit a fresh
eight-month low. Reports that cash cattle traded $1.00 lower this
week sent the futures market tumbling. The June futures are still
overextended on the downside, technically, on a short-term basis. The
bears are in full control of the market. Prices are trading way below
an accelerating two-month-old downtrend line on the daily bar chart.
Next support, basis June, is seen at $69.82--Wednesday's low. First
resistance comes in at the $70.50 level.

August feeder cattle closed up 53 cents today at $80.00. Prices also
posted a corrective rebound after the sharp losses Wednesday. Recent
history continues to play out, as the market bounced up from the
losses of the past two days. But if prices break down below the
bottom of the recent trading range, which is right at Wednesday's low
of $87.40, then the door is opened to a lower trend down to the
January low just above the $86.00 level. Next resistance is seen at
$88.30. First support is seen at $87.40.

June lean hogs closed firmer today. The bears still have the momentum
on their side at present. Next support lies at $67.00--today's low.
First resistance is located at the 69.00 level.

GRAINS: July corn futures closed 6 3/4 cents lower at $1.98 1/4
today. A bearish USDA report indicating large carryover stocks of
corn pushed prices lower today. Prices closed near the session low,
after gapping sharply lower on the daily bar chart. Prices were under
pressure earlier this week after weekly crop progress reports showed
good corn-planting progress in the U.S. The past 25 years of chart
history shows nearby corn futures prices do not stay below $2.00 very
long. However, the shorter-term technicals are very bearish at
present, and would-be bottom pickers don't want to stand in front of
a freight train. Next support is now seen at $1.95. Next resistance
is seen at today's high of $2.03.

July soybeans closed 4 1/2 cents lower at $4.35 today. Prices closed
near the session low amid a bearish USDA report released this
morning. The bearish report did put pressure on the market, but not
the strong pressure corn saw. Traders have factored much of the
bearish news into the soybean market. Odds are lessening that a minor
bull flag could be forming on the daily bar chart. Bears still have
the solid advantage. Fundamentally, there is not much in the way of
good news for bulls right now. I would not be surprised to see the
commodity funds make another downside push in beans in the near term.
It's going to take a significant weather scare this spring or summer
to force prices solidly higher. First resistance is seen at the $4.45
area and then $4.50. First support is seen at $4.30.

July soybean meal closed off $1.80 at $154.50 today. Prices did not
put in that bad of a performance today, given the bearish USDA
report. Prices this week are consolidating after they pushed to a
fresh eight-week high last Friday. Recent price action is still
encouraging to the bulls and is one sign the lows are in place in the
meal market. Next resistance comes in at the $158.50 area. First
support is seen at $154.00.

July bean oil closed 6 points lower at 14.77 cents today. Prices
scored a fresh contract low today of 14.75 cents. Oil is technically
weaker than beans or meal right now. But I would be surprised if
there is much downside left in oil. Next resistance comes in at 15.00
cents. Next support is seen at 14.50 cents.

July Chicago wheat closed 2 3/4 cents higher at $2.68 1/2 today. A
bullish USDA report boosted wheat higher, but prices did back off
from the highs and close near the session low, due mostly to the
weakness in corn and soybeans. Prices just Wednesday touched the
contract low of $2.65. If prices can post a strong bounce in the next
couple sessions, a double-bottom reversal pattern could be forming on
the daily bar chart. Bears are in command. Serious technical damage
has occurred the past few sessions. First support lies at the
contract low of $2.65. Next resistance is seen at $2.73--today's
high.

K.C. July HRW wheat closed up 5 cents at $3.27 1/4 today. A bullish
USDA wheat production figure today boosted HRW. Prices gapped higher
on the daily bar chart, but backed well off the highs by the close.
It will be important for bulls to show some follow-through strength
on Friday. Serious chart damage has been inflicted the past few
sessions and bears still rule. For bulls to get back in the ballgame,
they need to push prices north and fill the downside gap on the daily
bar chart (created last week) by pushing prices to the $3.34 area.
That's a tall order right now. Next resistance is seen at the $3.31
level-- today's high. Next support is seen at $3.21 1/2.

SOFTS: July N.Y. sugar closed 6 points higher at 9.06 cents today. We
now could see a minor bullish pennant forming in sugar, on the daily
bar chart. This many times occurs as prices consolidate steep gains.
A three-month high was scored in July sugar late last week. The bulls
have good momentum and a steep and accelerating six-week-old uptrend
line is still in place on the daily bar chart. Next resistance now
comes in at 9.25 cents. First support is now seen at 8.80 cents.

July N.Y. coffee closed 65 points higher at 68.55 cents today. Prices
closed near the session high. The bulls have gained momentum of late.
This recent upmove is the most significant showing by the bulls since
mid-January. The fact that prices have not sold off sharply the past
few sessions is encouraging for the bulls, too--given recent price
history. Still, the bears could be setting a trap, like they did in
early January. If bulls can push prices above 70 cents and then see
follow-through strength, bears will begin to think this uptrend is
sustainable. First resistance comes in at 70 cents. First support is
seen 65.00 cents.

July N.Y. cocoa closed $28 higher today, at $1,050. Prices today
matched the six-week high scored yesterday, and finished close to the
session high. Tuesday's strong gap-higher trade on the daily bar
chart put the bulls back on a level playing field with the bears. If
prices can push higher Friday, bulls will have the edge. Prices this
week pushed above and negated a 2.5-month-old downtrend line on the
daily bar chart. Next resistance comes in at $1,060. First support is
now seen at $1,025.

July cotton closed 60 points lower at 44.83 cents today. Prices
scored a new contract low in the wake of a bearish USDA report.
However, most traders did expect the bearish figures in the
report--namely high carryover stocks. Cotton is presently in a strong
bear market. Right now, any rebounds are likely to be just selling
opportunities for the bears. But, my bias is still that we are not
that far from a bottoming process. Next support lies at 44.00 cents.
First resistance is seen around 47.00 cents. Would-be bottom-pickers
should beware.

July orange juice futures closed 80 points higher today, at 79.50
cents. Prices closed near the session high again today after
Wednesday pushing higher and filling an important downside gap area
on the daily bar chart. Today's USDA report was termed mostly neutral
by the trade. Bulls are gaining confidence after the past two days'
action. Next resistance is now seen at 80.00 cents. Next support
comes in at 78.00 cents.

METALS: June COMEX gold closed off $0.90 today, at $269.50. Prices
corrected a bit today after Wednesday's strong gains that pushed
prices to a two-month high. This market is in a nice uptrend since
scoring its early-April low. This week's type of price action is what
bulls needed to gain confidence to trek farther north on the chart.
Next resistance is located at $273. First support is seen at $268.00.

July silver closed down $0.065 today, at $4.35 an ounce. Prices sold
off sharply today after rallying sharply Wednesday. This should not
surprise many. Silver prices are still not that far above the
contract low. Prices are chopping at lower levels, and this suggests
a "basing" action that many markets need to change the trend from
down, to sideways, to eventually up. Next support is seen at $4.30.
First resistance is seen at $4.425. Bears still have the advantage.

July N.Y. copper closed 40 points lower today, at 75.95 cents. Prices
today matched the contract low scored in early April. The stock
market and the U.S. economy will have to be healthy before the bulls
can really get something going in copper. Next resistance is seen at
77.00 cents. Next support is seen at 75.00 cents.

ENERGIES: July crude closed $0.12 higher at $29.06 today. Prices
closed well off the high of $29.43. Bulls and bears are still at a
stand-off, but bull will gain the edge on a move above $29.50. Expect
more choppy trading. Next support is seen at 28.00. Next resistance
lies at $29.50.

July heating oil closed 5 points higher today, at .7715. Bulls still
have the slight edge. Look for more choppy trading in the near
future. Next support is seen at 75.00 cents. Next resistance is seen
at 79.00 cents.

July unleaded gasoline closed 29 points lower at 1.0040 today. Prices
scored a new contract high just Monday. Bulls are still in command as
peak driving season nears. Top-pickers beware! Next resistance is
seen at $1.03. First support is seen at $.9780.

July natural gas closed 13.7 cents higher at $4.41 today. After,
prices hit a fresh five-and-one-half-month Wednesday, we saw a
corrective bounce today. Next support is seen at $4.20 and first
resistance is at $4.50. This market is still short-term oversold,
technically.

FINANCIALS, CURRENCIES: The June Euro currency closed 32 points lower
at .8812 today. Prices scored a bearish "outside day" down today and
pushed to a fresh four-week low. Bears have the edge. The European
Central Bank (ECB) cut interest rates today, which initially boosted
the Euro, but those gains were short-lived. My bias is still that
there is not much downside left in the Euro. Look for more choppy
action in the near term. Next support is now seen at .8750. Next
resistance is seen at .8900.

The June Japanese yen closed 33 points lower at .8190 today. Bears
are in control. Bulls are hoping for some "basing" activity at lower
levels, and that may be occurring, although it's too early to tell.
Next support now lies at the .8100 level. First resistance is seen at
the .8326 level.

The June Swiss franc closed 3 points lower at .5744. Bears are in
command as prices scored a bearish "outside day" down on the daily
bar chart today. Prices pushed to a fresh four-week low today. Still,
my bias is that prices won't deteriorate much more. Next support is
seen at the .5700 level. First resistance comes in at the .5800
level.

The June Australian dollar futures closed unchanged at .5234 today.
Prices pushed to another fresh two-month high today. The bulls have
the advantage as a six-week-old uptrend line is in place on the daily
bar chart. First resistance is now seen at .5300. First support is
now seen at .5200.

The June Canadian dollar closed 20 points lower today, at .6478.
Monday's key reversal does not indicate prices are headed back toward
the lows seen a few weeks ago. What it does suggest is a downside
correction to the recent gains may occur over the near term. Bulls
still have the slight edge, on a short-term basis. This currency had
been near recent historic lows and I do not think there is much more
downside. Next resistance is seen at the .6548 level. First support
is seen at the .6450 level.

The June British pound closed 18 points higher at 1.4218. Trading
continues choppy at lower levels. This currency was not that far
above recent historic lows and I do not think there is much more
downside in the sterling. One could argue that price action the past
few weeks has been a "basing" before prices eventually turn north. A
move above the 1.4500 level would be considered a bullish "upside
breakout" from the recent congestion area. A move below 1.4100 would
be considered a bearish downside breakout. Next support is now seen
at the 1.4160 level. Next resistance comes in at the 1.4300 level.

The June U.S. dollar index closed 30 points higher at 116.52 today.
Prices scored a bullish "outside day" up on the daily bar chart, and
pushed to a fresh four-week high. Bulls have the momentum in the near
term. Next resistance lies at the 117.00 level. First support is seen
at the 115.50 area. My bias is still that a near-term top is in place
in the dollar index, but if prices push above the 117.00 area in the
near term, odds increase that a new high will be scored.

June U.S. T-bonds closed 1 6/32 lower today at 101 1/32. Bulls today
lost most of the momentum they had gained last week. A surprise
interest rate cut by the European Central Bank pressured the U.S.
debt market. See more on the bond market in this evening's
newsletter. Next support is seen at 100 even--par. First resistance
is seen at 102 16/32 level.

The June U.S. T-note closed off 27.0 (32nds) today at 104.12.5. Bears
have the slight edge and prices scored a bearish "outside day" down
on the daily bar chart today. First support is seen at the 104.00.0
level. First resistance is seen at 105.10.5--today's high.

Anne,

Can we add PG&E Topock and Mojave Topock index points to the NCD locations?  
I think we discussed that they can't be added because of their association 
with Socal curves.  Let me know.

Also, can we add the new rockies index locations to the NCD sheet?  It would 
be nice to see these locations broken out in detail.

Mike

Phillip:  You will get a kick out of this.  Tommorow, Gossett is going to 
give us a quiz to see what we know, and what we do not know.  I am sure all 
of your lessons will pay off.  Have a good evening.

We now have a PG&E topock basis product on EOL.  The curve is currenlty 
mapped to Socal with the differential to Socal being calculated in the 
physical index curve.  Let's work on setting up this curve on Tuesday so that 
it shows the accurate value for fin deals.  We can have the curve calc off of 
a discount to citygate in Keith's spreadsheet.

Greg,

I wanted to forward this letter to you that I received from a good friend of 
mine who is interested in discussing global steel trading oppotunities with 
Enron.  If you don't mind, I would like to have Chase Belew call you to 
possibly set up a meeting.

I work on the west gas trading desk.  You can reach me at x37031.  Thank you 
for your assistance.

Sincerely,
Mike Grigsby

Mike,

As per our conversation, I would appreciate your help to arrange a short
meeting with executives from Enron Networks and a group from our company.

e-STEEL (www.e-steel.com) has become the preferred marketplace as well as
the recognized technological and collaborative commerce leader for the
$800billion global steel market. We have financial backing from Goldman
Sachs and Kleiner Perkins and have alliance contracts with companies
throughout the steel supply chain, including U.S. Steel and Ford Motor
Company . Because we consider Enron another leader in the development of
electronic marketplaces, we feel that there may be areas for mutual
cooperation. The purpose of our meeting is strictly exploratory.

Our group will consist of myself and Mr. Russ Carleson (Vice President,
Sales) from our headquarters in New York. We would like to propose a lunch
meeting next Thursday, September 14th, if possible. I will call you this
week to follow up.

Thanks,


Chase Belew

Dear John,

I had a meeting with Phillip after our morning discussion about P&L and it 
seems that there may be some issues regarding how I run my book.  It was my 
mistake about whether or not the put options for April Socal were booked 
properly.  The options were booked properly by Larry May and my Book runners 
and the profit was realized for 03/08.   My apologies for declaring that the 
options were not in my position.  Also, the tolls curves are not treated as 
schedule C.  I will adjust the tolls curves to account for basis curveshift 
as needed.  My P&L did not match the Socal position because of physical index 
curveshift and an adjustment to transport.  

The discussion and feedback from Phillip regarding your conversation with him 
concerns me.  I am confident that I run the most accurate physical and 
financial trading book within Enron.   I will stand on the fact that no one 
within the market has a better understanding of his/her position better than 
I.  The physical/financial risk in my book is managed to a standard not seen 
at Enron since I have been here.   Few people realize the great lengths I go 
to to manage the risk in the IM West trading book.  

I am transitioning from my role as a trader on the west desk to one that it 
is responsible for communicating with you directly.  Let's get together and 
discuss exactly what my responsibilities to you will be going forward.   It 
may be that I relied to heavily on my subordination to Phillip Allen up until 
this point.  This may have contributed to my miscommunication with you.  I 
will see that this will not happen in the future.  Thank you for all of my 
added responsibilities.

Sincerely,
Mike Grigsby

It looks like Anne accidentally include two Sumas trades in the Rockies data 
priced at 13.90 and 14.00.  She will send out a revised spreadsheet on 
Thursday.  The Rockies Opal wacog will then be $5.913.  Sorry for the error.

Hello.  The west gas desk would like to send a mailout to our EOL customers 
regarding the new opportunity to trade "odd lots" on every physical product.  
EOL has been instrumental in providing liquidity to previously illiquid 
physical delivery points in the west for standard volumes of 5000 mmbtu/d and 
greater, but we would like to notify our customers that EOL will now 
accommodate odd size lots, in 1 mmbtu increments.  This will allow us to 
trade the "non-standard" volumes with all of the market.

Do we have a creative team that might be able to assist us in our efforts?  
We were thinking about a one page mailout with a clear message.  We would 
like it to be very upbeat and funny.  

Thank you for your assistance.  I can be reached at x37031.


Sincerely,

Mike Grigsby
Director, West Gas trading

Will be happy to help this group.  They'll need to agree to the following:

1.  They pay for the cost (to be determined depending on the quality of the 
mailing)
2.  They provide a mailing list with following separate columns:
First name
Last Name
Company Name
Address
City
State
Zip
3.  Give us a draft of the text for the mailing
4.  Give us 5 working days to get it out.  (we will try to do it faster, but 
it depends on several factors)

Let's have Matt start on the following:

Database for hourly storage activity on Socal.  Begin forecasting hourly and 
daily activity by backing out receipts, using ISO load actuals and backing 
out real time imports to get in state gen numbers for gas consumption, and 
then using temps to estimate core gas load.  Back testing once he gets 
database created should help him forecast core demand.

Update Socal and PG&E forecast sheets.  Also, break out new gen by EPNG and 
TW pipelines.

Mike

We have created the new southern border index products for Socal and PG&E 
topock.  Please create your new basis and gas daily products for these 
indices as soon as possible.   Mattt will need to create the gd index 
products as well.  Let the brokers know about the new indices  I have the 
back office setting up new curves to book these deals.  You will have two 
curves for Socal now.  The curves will show your risk on the old index, as 
well as the new index.  The new Socal index is the same as the old except 
that excludes KRS.  

I will be taking these phys products out on EOL as soon as possible.

Thanks,
Mike

Matt,  

Please take a look at these spreadsheets and calc the gas usage by plant and 
by pipe in CA.  Chris Foster is telling us that most of these palnts will be 
shutting down in the next few weeks due to credit exposure.  Let's discuss 
the impact on sendouts.

Please make a few minor changes to the Scal product.  I would like it read 
GD/D SCal - HHUB.  I apologize about the mistake, but SCAL is a premium to 
HHUB.  We also need to take a look at the description, fixed and floating.

and Electric Co., with the happy acquiescence of the state, dumped a huge, 
long-term gas contract with El Paso. 
		For the state, the decision was a no-brainer: PG&E was buying more space on 
gas pipelines than it needed. 
		For El Paso, though, it was a disaster. The company started handing out pink 
slips like they were candy. 
		But in the long run, it wasn't El Paso that would end up on its knees. It 
would be PG&E and the state of California. 
		That pipeline space that the utility and regulators saw as unnecessary would 
soon become precious -- and El Paso, led by a law-sharp chairman with 
bare-knuckle smarts, would turn itself into the biggest natural gas firm in 
the world. 
		So big, in fact, that in the eyes of vengeance-minded lawmakers and 
regulators, El Paso has become a poster monster for how Californians came to 
be plagued by rolling blackouts and sky-high energy bills. 
		"They didn't mind seeing all of us at El Paso being dealt a terrible blow 
back then," said Randy Wu, an El Paso manager then. "And now . . . well, 
let's just say they should have planned better." -- -- -- 
		It's not like El Paso was some new kid on the block. 
		The company was founded in Texas in 1928 and stayed a local concern until 
1947, when it laid out 700 miles of pipeline to deliver gas to California. 
		It grew steadily from there until 1964, when the U.S. Supreme Court decided 
El Paso was getting too big and ordered it to divest its pipeline holdings in 
the Northwest. That set off a long tumble that William Wise, who had started 
at the company as a general counsel in 1970, set out to reverse when he took 
over as president in 1989. 
		Wise, a 56-year-old whose lean build reflects both his passion for running 
and his reputation for driving himself hard, is a rare bird in the world of 
oil. 
		The University of Colorado law school graduate has mastered both the legal 
side of his "litigious" industry, as he once called it, and its hardball 
economic strategies -- skills he honed by surfing the bust-boom cycles of his 
business at its epicenter, Texas. 
		Those skills came in handy when El Paso got the hammer blow from PG&E in 1996 
and 1997. 
		PG&E had been buying extra space on pipelines crossing into the state at the 
Arizona ghost town of Topock -- enough to import a whopping 1.1 billion cubic 
feet of natural gas a day. 
		The trouble for El Paso was that when PG&E dropped the contract for the 
pipeline space, $170 million of the company's annual revenue was erased. 
		"It seemed like everyone thought the company was toast," said Wu, the former 
El Paso manager. "Of course, California didn't care at all." 
		But Patrick Power, the attorney hired by El Paso to plead the pipeline 
company's case before the state Public Utilities Commission back in 1996, 
could see trouble looming for the state. 
		If PG&E and other utilities didn't keep the pipeline capacity to meet future 
needs, he warned, they would probably regret it later. His words fell on deaf 
ears. 
		"The mentality at the PUC, PG&E and Southern California Gas was, 'This will 
be El Paso's problem,' " Power said. -- -- -- 
		Wise reacted to the loss of the PG&E contract by taking no salary himself for 
a year and freezing his executives' pay, Wu said. While laying off more than 
one-third of the company's workers, he and his staff negotiated a hefty 
settlement from PG&E and other companies in exchange for their having dropped 
the pipeline space. 
		Then Wise set off on a plan to absorb other pipeline companies so he could 
expand his system of delivering natural gas throughout the United States. 
		"Bill Wise knew California had turned its back on the company, so he had to 
get creative," Wu said of Wise, who has declined interview requests from The 
Chronicle. 
		"Attorneys generally don't have a lot of common sense in my mind, but Bill - 
- he's got extra," said former El Paso Mayor Larry Francis. "He cuts his 
losses in a hurry, and he recognizes when he has to move on. And so he 
moved." 
		Within a few years, Wise stretched the now Houston-based company to full 
"wellhead to wire" operations, running everything from natural gas drilling 
to electric generation plants. Before El Paso embarked on this expansion, 
California constituted fully two-thirds of El Paso's natural gas sales -- 
much of that to PG&E. 
		The strategy was that if the state was going to ditch El Paso, El Paso would 
make sure its reach became so extended in other directions that it would 
never be dependent on one market again. 
		Wise's company scooped up interests in 40 electric power plants in 11 states 
by April 2000. Along the way, it spent billions acquiring enough pipeline 
companies to spread the El Paso reach along 58,000 miles of pipe nationwide, 
from Bakersfield to Boston. 
		"The company was a very traditional gas company until then," said Fred 
Pickel, a Los Angeles energy consultant who has observed El Paso since the 
1970s. "Wise, though, understands the street-level complexities of the 
business, and what he had the company do was partly smart and partly logic. 
		"He was just able to see the possibilities that nobody here in California was 
able to see." 
		But some believe that what El Paso did to take advantage of those 
possibilities took unfair advantage of California. 
		In his cluttered downtown San Francisco office at the PUC, staff attorney 
Harvey Morris thought he "smelled a rat" as long as three years ago. 
		Morris, a natty 47-year-old graduate of Boalt Hall School of Law, takes on 
the look of a determined terrier when he outlines his suspicions about El 
Paso -- and he's been carrying that look a long time now. 
		After losing PG&E, El Paso leased the utility's entire block of pipeline 
capacity to another Texas gas and electricity giant, Dynegy. Gas experts were 
stunned that one firm would bid for all that space -- but they, and Morris, 
were even more surprised by what followed. 
		Dynegy didn't behave the way PG&E and California officials had expected 
energy companies to behave in the era of deregulation. 
		Like PG&E, Dynegy didn't need all that pipeline space to serve its own 
customers. But unlike what PG&E did when confronted with all that extra 
space, Dynegy didn't resell it at a huge discount. In fact, Dynegy didn't 
sell any of the space. Instead, it raised the price so high that seemingly 
nobody wanted to buy it. 
		Competing gas marketers were alarmed. They suspected that Dynegy was 
collaborating with El Paso to constrict the supply of gas flowing into 
California so prices would rise. Great for anyone with space reserved on the 
pipeline -- but disastrous for those left out in the cold. 
		In 1998, having convinced his bosses at the PUC that what El Paso was doing 
on the Dynegy contract was anticompetitive, Morris filed the first of many 
complaints with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. He's still pursuing 
them. 
		As it turned out, spot prices didn't rise while Dynegy held the contract; gas 
shippers could still find space on other pipelines for less money. Dynegy let 
the contract lapse in late 1999. 
		Not long afterward, the pipeline contract wound up with El Paso's market 
affiliate, El Paso Merchant Energy. And that's when things started to get 
really serious, Morris says. 
		El Paso's own marketing arm now controlled more pipeline space heading into 
Southern California than any other trader by far -- just as the demand for 
gas was about to soar. 
		In his many filings, in which the PUC has been joined by Southern California 
Edison and others, Morris contends that El Paso Merchant Energy prevented 
pipeline space from being used. 
		"They basically kept so much of the capacity to themselves, the prices went 
through the roof," he said. "It was the same as closing off part of the 
pipeline." 
		El Paso officials, for their part, say market rates started soaring in 2000 
simply because the demand for gas overwhelmed supply. They say they never 
charged more than what industry rules allowed, and that attempts to prove 
otherwise are preposterous. 
		And thus far, except for a mild rebuke here and there on technicalities, the 
free-market-minded Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has not concluded the 
company did anything wrong -- though a commission hearing is set for tomorrow 
on the latest allegations filed by PG&E, Edison and the PUC. 
		Edison estimates that El Paso's "manipulation" at Topock jacked up rates all 
over the industry so badly that state gas buyers had to pay $3.8 billion more 
than they should have just in the past year. 
		Whatever the reason, the bottom line is that gas prices in California have 
been anywhere from two to 10 times as expensive as on the other side of the 
border in Arizona, and in almost every other state. 
		Once prices started to rise at Topock, gas marketers throughout California 
followed suit -- and the ripple spread quickly. 
		Gas prices for consumers started going up. The rise also propelled 
electricity costs skyward, because three out of every five electricity plants 
in California run on natural gas. 
		The firms that own those plants then jacked up electricity prices to the 
utilities, like PG&E, which had shed many of their own plants as part of 
deregulation. 
		The problem for PG&E and other utilities is that they couldn't pass those 
higher electricity costs on to their customers, because electricity rates 
were still regulated. 
		So the red ink started to gush, in the hundreds of millions of dollars. And, 
		with gas prices still higher here than anywhere else, it is still gushing. 
		But not for El Paso. -- -- -- 
		El Paso Energy rose from its financial emergency in 1996 to become not just a 
survivor, but a $50 billion behemoth involved in virtually every aspect of 
the energy industry in California and much of the rest of the United States. 
		The company, renamed El Paso Corp. this February, is now practically printing 
money. The company's revenue shot from $1 billion in 1995 to $22 billion last 
year; its profit last year alone was $652 million, its highest ever. Wise's 
compensation package reportedly totaled $20 million. 
		And it's not just with gas that El Paso is making its money. Among its 
holdings are 19 small power plants serving PG&E and Southern California 
Edison. 
		Under El Paso's contracts, the price of that electricity automatically rises 
when the price of gas rises. That's true even at the power plants that don't 
use any natural gas. 
		All told, in just a bit more than one year alone, consultants for Edison say 
El Paso earned an extra $85 million thanks to electricity produced by those 
plants. 
		And all this is blossoming for El Paso while PG&E wallows in bankruptcy 
court, billions of dollars in debt with no relief in sight. 
		The one cloud on El Paso's horizon: A host of California legislators, 
industry experts and state regulators suspect that El Paso's sunny profit 
picture owes a lot to what happened with that huge block of space on El 
Paso's natural gas pipeline that PG&E had been so happy to surrender. 
		The hearing before federal regulators is looming tomorrow, and just last 
month the state Assembly Subcommittee on Energy Oversight dragged three top 
El Paso executives -- but not Wise -- to Sacramento to testify on the matter. 
		It was the first time the company has ever felt such heat in this state. And 
though the executives grimly waved off reporters' questions as they strode 
from the room, company spokeswoman Norma Dunn stayed behind to insist that 
the accusations will blow over, "because there's nothing to them. 
		"The thing to remember is that we have been in this state for more than 50 
years, and we want to continue being here," Dunn said. "We take this matter 
very seriously. . . . We want to be cooperative." 
		Accusations that El Paso caused price spikes by maneuvering to hold pipeline 
space hostage amount to "nothing but conspiracy theories," she said. 
		The Assembly panel, however, concluded that both El Paso and Dynegy had 
manipulated the market at an enormous cost to California consumers. 
		"The numbers tell the truth," the subcommittee said in a report obtained by 
The Chronicle. "The exorbitant prices cannot be defined away by regulators 
and bureaucrats, or explained away by corporate lawyers' wordplay." The 
report was produced by three Assembly Democrats and two Republicans. 
		Wise, when he addresses the accusations, says he is mystified why state 
lawmakers are mad. He points to company plans to expand pipelines heading 
here and to even build a power plant at San Francisco International Airport. 
		When it comes to California, "El Paso has always tried to be a part of the 
solution, not the problem," he told a gas industry newsletter in December. 
		State lawmakers' attempts to pry extensive hard numbers from El Paso have 
been met with resistance from the company, which calls them proprietary 
information. And judging by Morris' experience, chasing El Paso to the ground 
may take the Legislature quite a while, if that's what it decides it wants to 
do. 
		Morris found that as he filed complaint after complaint against the company, 
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission would either rule against the PUC or 
put the filings off so long that they were moot when they came up. 
		The Assembly subcommittee's report was scathing in regard to the commission, 
		saying its approval of El Paso pipeline contracts "raises serious questions 
about whether it met its statutory duty under the federal Natural Gas Act to 
protect consumers from unjust and unreasonable rates." 
		The commission did not send anyone to the Assembly hearings and has refused 
to comment on its rulings. 
		By the time the El Paso Merchant Energy contract expires May 31, opening the 
crucial block of pipeline capacity to what critics say is true competition 
for the first time in more than three years, it will be far too late, Morris 
said. 
		"The damage was done long ago," Morris said. The state and its utilities are 
on the hook for billions in debt, money for last winter's bills has already 
left consumers' pockets -- and regulators fear prices are unlikely to come 
down soon. 
		"The market got set, and now we're in trouble," Morris said. -- -- -- 
		PG&E, for its part, sees the whole mess through the eyes of a victim. 
		The utility had paid $560 million to hold its excess El Paso capacity from 
1993 to 1997, and the PUC had forbidden the company to recover $167 million 
of that through customer rates. And in 1996, the PUC and ratepayers were 
clamoring for lower power bills, and there was a huge amount of pipeline 
space in the state that wasn't being used. 
		So when you're trying to cut costs, what better to cut than something you 
don't need? said Dan Thomas, PG&E's director of gas transmission. 
		"I still think it was the right decision to relinquish the capacity," he 
said. 
		Still, there's no denying the numbers. At latest count, PG&E owed El Paso 
more than $150 million for gas and electricity. 
		As Morris sees it, El Paso is "this big, 800-pound gorilla at the border and 
can limit supplies as they wish. It's outrageous, and there wasn't a thing 
anybody could do to stop them." 
		El Paso officials, of course, put it differently. 
		"All we did was good business, smart business, and people keep dishing dirt 
about us, but we just don't see ourselves in it," company spokesman Mel Scott 
said. 
		"It's pretty obvious to the analysts and to us that California set up this 
faulty deregulation system, and if (PG&E and Southern California utilities) 
had been in their right minds and signed up for long-term natural gas 
contracts back in 1996 and 1997, they wouldn't be in this trouble." 
		Nobody official at El Paso is publicly gloating, but pleasure over the turn 
of events is never far from the surface. Those who can speak more freely 
don't mind putting the boot in a bit. 
		"Everything bad that's happening right now (in the pipeline fight) could have 
been prevented if PG&E just hadn't gotten rid of that contract back then, " 
Wu said. "But I have yet to hear anyone in this state say that. 
		"In fact, I have yet to hear anyone even at PG&E say that, and that's sad." 
		What it all comes down to is this: El Paso figured out how to play 
California's energy game better than California. 
		"Those laws your boys passed there in California -- well, they just left you 
wide open to anyone who wanted to make an enormous profit," said Tom "Smitty" 
Smith, director of the Austin headquarters of Public Citizen, a consumer 
rights group. 
		"You can't fault the horse for eating hay when you lead it to the barn and 
put the bale right in front of its face, now can you?" 
California's 'energy island' 
		There are just four points at the border where natural gas comes into 
energy-starved California. The main one, owned by El Paso, is at the Colorado 
River. The pipelines originate in the Southwest. They wind 1,000 miles 
through several states to pop up right where Route 66 used to cut over the 
Colorado River on its famous arched steel bridge. Today two of El Paso's 
pipelines are all that use the old bridge.

We should change all settlements at Socal to NGI Southern Border, Socal from 
Southern California Border average.  This new index excludes KRS fixed priced 
trades.  Please let the brokers know about the changes to Socal basis going 
forward.  Please change basis and gd swing swaps (fp and index) in EOL.

Also,  Frank and Matt should set up basis and a gd swap (fp and index) for  
southern border, PG&E.  This will be the index for PG&E Topock.  This index 
will be effective for April 2001.  I will have the physical product out there 
as soon as possible.

Let me know when they have been changed.

Mike

I told you Friday that I would make 2.5 million.  The actuals came in right 
around 1 million due to a correction to the Sumas GD curves and an 
overestimate of $450,000.  Sorry about the mistake.

The PG&E basis position in TDS does not match the FEB/MAR position.  The Baja 
spread was executed as a NOV-MAR position months ago. The only real changes 
were to Socal basis over time. There is no telling when this might have 
changed in error.  Will you please research the position to see when this 
position was reduced.  I am guessing that a park and loan was executed by 
Frank Ermis at some point and the basis risk was allocated to GD New by 
mistake.  

Thanks,
Mike

Steve,

Let's discuss all of your new rox products for EOL.  I would like to know 
which products to roll out on EOL for April bidweek.  I would also like to 
discuss creating a south of Muddy Creek product for Kern gas.  I would assume 
that it would fall under the IF Kern index.  

Thanks,
Mike

I tried logging in to corp, but it failed because it prompted for new 
hardware - a 3COM card?  Should I get a phone number of one of the 
technicians, so that I may call them from my house when I try to log in.  

Also, the guys set up a hub for my desktop and laptop.  How do I have the 
laptop share the printer (which is connected to my desktop)?  Do I use 
Network Neighborhood?

Thanks,
Mike

Subject: A Computer and Internet Connection for You and Your Family

As you know, technology is critical to Enron; it drives our success and wil=
l=20
continue to do so in the future. Technology has helped Enron create new=20
businesses like Enron Broadband Services and Enron Net Works, and it is=20
responsible for applications such as EnronOnline and EnronCredit.com.  You=
=01,ve=20
seen what technology can do at work.  Now we want you and your family to=20
realize its benefits at home.

With that in mind, we are excited to let you know that we are introducing t=
he=20
ClickAtHome
program, which will give each employee a computer for use at home. Where=20
technology permits, we will also subsidize an Internet connection. With the=
=20
click of a mouse, a home computer plus Internet access will put a world of=
=20
Internet knowledge at your family=01,s fingertips. =20

We have just signed an agreement with Dell Computer Corporation to provide=
=20
the computer hardware. We wanted to let you know about the program now in=
=20
case you and your family were considering the purchase or upgrade of a home=
=20
computer or Internet connection in the next few months. The scope of=20
ClickAtHome includes the following:

? Basic package: Dell desktop computer with a high-speed processor, floppy=
=20
disk drive, mouse, speakers, monitor, modem, CD-ROM drive and Windows 2000=
=20
software. Employees will have the option to receive a subsidized Internet=
=20
connection, including broadband, where commercially available.
? Participation: This program will be available to active regular full-time=
=20
and regular part-time employees of Enron and its wholly owned subsidiaries;=
=20
however, employees of some Enron companies (Portland General Electric, EOTT=
,=20
Enron Facility Services) may not be able to participate due to legal,=20
accounting, tax, labor or business reasons.  Eligibility includes being=20
employed at the time of implementation. =20
? Timing: U.S. employee sign-up will begin in early 2001, with delivery of=
=20
the equipment and Internet connection to follow shortly thereafter.  Delive=
ry=20
of equipment to participating non-U.S. employees is targeted for late 2001.

Details about this program are still being finalized.  To address some of=
=20
your initial questions, we=01,ve posted a question-and-answer document on=
=20
http://clickathome.enron.com.  We will schedule an eSpeak session in the ne=
ar=20
future where you will have an opportunity to ask questions. Or, you can=20
submit your questions and comments to ClickAtHome@enron.com.=20

We are excited to extend our investment in technology to you and your=20

by creating endless possibilities for you to experience and participate in=

Enron is a great place to work.

We need to run regression on this load profile for Palo Alto.  We should back 
out the industrial class and run their residential load.  Can you find 
reliable weather for Palo Alto?  Kim Ward is signing a full requirements deal 
with Palo on PG&E.

Thanks,
Mike

Hey guys.  Let's try this.  Take the data from 2000 and change the 
following.  Take Keystone West volumes to 850,000/d rateably, then add the 
new gen numbers posted below.  You will need to add this demand to the EOC S 
ML demand numbers (Is Salmayuca included in this number?).  We should use the 
2000 waha west volumes for now.  You should end up with reduced ehrenberg 
volumes for the reduction in Keystone west volumes and the addition of New 
Gen demand.  Run the storage balance at 2000 Socal in this scenario.  We will 
then plug forward with waha west volumes to balance Socal in 2001.  Also, add 
columns to adjust (90%, 60%, 50%, etc) the burns for new gen in SW.  We 
should then look to adjusting socal demand down for the high hydro/increased 
NW imports to CA scenario that could happen.  Use the SP-15 2000 gen numbers 
and then back out the avg of 1999 and 2000 power imports.  I would like to 
avoid averaging 1999 and 2000 socal gas demand. Use a 10,000 heat rate to 
reduce gas demand.  Have Jay adjust EOC demand for normal weather.  We may 
have to refer to the load sensitivity data from west power to reduce the SW 
electric loads and then back out of gen numbers using a 10,000 heat rate.  We 
will then be exposed to EPNG and the OPS increasing Keystone west volumes 
between now and next summer - run the 2001 with this possibility as well.  
Take Key West to 1.1 bcf.  Let me know where my errors in approach may be.

This should give us a picture of the Socal deliverability for 2001.





Thanks,
Mike

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~* Daily Riddle ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

Today's Riddle is -


Today we have two riddles again.
 1. What common English verb becomes its own past tense by
rearranging its letters?
 2. If it takes a man one hour to dig a hole two meters long,
two meters wide, and two meters deep, how long would it take
the same man to dig a hole four meters long, four meters wide,
and four meters deep, assuming he digs at the same rate of speed?

The answer to today's Riddle is -

1. Answer: Eat becomes Ate
2. Eight hours. It takes twice as long to double the length, twice
as long to double the width, and twice as long to double the depth.
To find cubic measurement you multiply length x width x height;
therefore, on the first hole, one hour equals 2 m x 2 m x 2 m or
8 cubic meters. On the second hole, the formula is 4 m x 4 x 4 m
or 64 cubic meters.

Frank,

The new procedures for trading basis are working well.  We still need to get 
the desk comfortable with submitting orders to you guys, but overall I am 
pleased with the new procedure.    I need to work on staying out of the basis 
market entirely going forward. Can you also try to work all basis at Socal 
through Keith.  Let Keith and Mo see all of your Socal/Malin spreads in the 
future.  I think I gave you an order to work Apr-Oct 02 socal/malin at the 
same time Keith was trying to sell a-o 02 socal basis.  I will let him know 
in the future so that we do not cross him in the market.

Thanks,
Mike

That was the main factor.  The cash market also had a difficult time trading 
higher than 14.50.  The basis curve was on its way to contango, when it has 
lived in backwardation for some time.  This created resistance on the basis 
curve.  The PG&E announcement pushed it over the edge.  Market is back up 
today on stronger cash and the socal edison announcement.

Saturday, May 12, 2001

QUOTE OF THE DAY
=========================

"WASHINGTON, May 11 President Bush said today that the surest
and swiftest way to help Americans cope with rising gas and
oil prices was to enact a sweeping tax cut, which he said
would give them more money to pay for the increases. "If I
had my way, I'd have it in place tomorrow, so that people
would have money in their pockets to deal with high energy
prices," Mr. Bush said at news conference in the White
House. "The Congress needs to act." Mr. Bush's comments came
a day after the Senate, like the House, approved a budget
plan that calls for $1.35 trillion in tax cuts over the next
11 years, and Mr. Bush sought to seize that momentum, urging
both chambers of Congress to pass the tax cut itself before
their Memorial Day recess. Mr. Bush also sought to link his
push for a tax cut to the nation's energy woes more strongly
than ever before. He cited those woes as a rationale for a
reduction in taxes, and he cited a tax cut as an answer to
those woes. After several weeks in which administration
officials had cautioned Americans that there was little if
anything that their energy policy, to be unveiled on
Thursday, could do to help consumers in the short term, Mr.
Bush today pitched his tax cut as, in fact, a ready-made
remedy. And he did so at a time of growing worry among
Republicans that rising gas and oil prices could seriously
damage his presidency. "Let me say it again, see if I can be
more clear," the president said in response to one of many
questions about other approaches to dealing with energy
problems. "To the Congress, who is interested in helping
consumers pay high gas prices: `Pass the tax relief as
quickly as possible.' "We've set aside $100 billion to help
consumers with high energy prices," Mr. Bush continued,
referring to a part of the suggested tax cut that would be
distributed among taxpayers this year. "That's the quickest
way to help consumers. I am deeply concerned about
consumers. I'm deeply concerned about high gas prices. To
anybody who wants to figure out how to help the consumers,
pass the tax relief package as quickly as possible." Many
low-income people, who are least able to afford a steep
escalation in the cost of cooling their homes or filling
their cars, would receive only modest amounts of money from
the tax cut Mr. Bush has proposed. Beyond that, the poorest
of these people, who pay no taxes, may not receive any
financial relief at all from a tax cut. But Mr. Bush and his
advisers clearly craved an opportunity for the president to
appear empathetic and in charge of the situation amid
predictions by some analysts that the price of a gallon of
gas could reach $3 this summer. Today's news conference,
which was almost 30 minutes long, was the third in the White
House the president had held since his inauguration nearly
four months ago. Mr. Bush also wanted to claim victory for
the Congressional passage of a budget plan with a tax cut
only slightly smaller than the one he initially proposed.
And he expressed support for Attorney General John
Ashcroft's decision, announced shortly before Mr. Bush
spoke, to delay until June 11 the planned execution of
Timothy J. McVeigh. "He is lucky to be an American," Mr.
Bush said of Mr. McVeigh. "This is a country that will bend
over backwards to make sure that his constitutional rights
are guaranteed, as opposed to rushing his fate." The
president added that the failure of F.B.I. officials to turn
over documents to which Mr. McVeigh's defense lawyers were
entitled had neither persuaded him that Mr. McVeigh was
unjustly convicted nor shaken his faith in the fairness with
which the death penalty is meted out. As the governor of
Texas, Mr. Bush presided over more than 150 executions in
six years. Asked about the recent expulsion of the United
States from the United Nations Human Rights Commission, Mr.
Bush grew more animated than usual, his anger evident. "The
decision was an outrageous decision," he said. "To me it
undermines the whole credibility of this commission." Like
Mr. Bush's two previous White House news conferences, this
one was announced only shortly before it began, and Mr. Bush
for a third time eschewed the formal trappings of the East
Room for the less formal press briefing room. He seemed
determined to maintain a jocular demeanor even about grave
subjects, smiling and laughing for a moment before answering
a question about a 4-month-old Palestinian baby killed by
Israeli fire this week. The issue he discussed most was
energy, as he set the stage for his administration's
announcement of its policy, one that will call for the
construction of power plants and more oil and gas
exploration on federal lands. Many voters are concerned
about the environmental repercussions of such measures, and
Mr. Bush sought both to address those concerns and to assert
that energy problems were long in the making and would be
long in the solving. "This is a situation that's been
developing over the years, and it's going to take a while to
correct," Mr. Bush said, presenting himself as the blunt
bearer of mixed tidings and later adding, "I'm going to tell
the truth when it comes to energy: that we have a serious
problem, that we need to do a couple of things." "We need to
be more conservation- minded in America," he said. "But I'm
also going to say, as plainly as I can, we won't conserve
our way to energy independence. We must also increase
supply." Mr. Bush's discussion of the nation's energy
problems in some ways mirrored his evaluations of the
economy, in which he has gone out of his way to document
that he inherited a troubling situation. He said today that
he hoped an economic recovery would be imminent, but that
"there's no question that the minute I got elected, the
storm clouds on the horizon were getting nearly directly
overhead.""

Let's start thinking about transitioning SJ to 100% flow.  I would like to 
discuss all of the issues and costs of presenting such a product to the 
market.  Think about what we might need in the form of Northwest transport, 
storage, operations personnel, etc.  I realize that this will be risky and 
that I may experience some financial downside with this endeavor, but I think 
we should press forward.  Will we need intra-day traders to place the gas?  
Do we need to establish intra-day relationships with SJ producers, utilities, 
etc?  Will the allocation on EL Paso in April alleviate some of the cuts?

Let's discuss in detail.

Mike

_____________________________________________________________________

The STOCK INDEXES were lower on Friday as investors continue to mark
time ahead of next Tuesday's FOMC meeting. Light pressure came from
today's retail sales report that came in above consensus along with
an unexpected rebound in consumer sentiment. Both markets are likely
to remain range bound for the time being. It will take closes above
last week's highs or below the late-April reaction lows to clear up
near-term direction in these markets.

The Dow closed lower on Friday and below this spring's uptrend line
due to light profit taking ahead of the weekend and next week's FOMC
meeting. The latest economic data suggests that any further cuts in
interest rates by the Fed next week might be their last for the time
being. The Dow has become extremely overbought and overdue for a
correction. Closes below last week's low crossing at 10,673.20 would
signal that a larger-degree decline might be unfolding this spring.

INTEREST RATES June bonds plunged to new lows for the year following
the release of the University of Michigan's May consumer sentiment
that came in at 92.6 verses 88.4 in April. Additional pressure came
from April's retail sales data, which came in above pre- report
estimates. Odds of a 50-basis-point cut in interest rates next
Tuesday are now estimated at 73% verses 83% last Friday. Today's
breakout below the 50% retracement level of the 2000-01 rally
crossing at 99- 30 opened the door for a likely test of the 62%
retracement level crossing at 98-07 later this month. Short-term
momentum indicators have turned bearish signaling that additional
weakness is possible.

The CRB INDEX closed out the week near session lows as it extended
its decline off last Friday's high. This week's breakout below
April's uptrend line along with a downturn by a number of momentum
indicators confirmed that last week's high marked a double top while
opening the door for sideways to lower prices for the last half of
May. Weakness in grains, meats, precious metals, some foods and
energies weighed on the CRB today.

ENERGY MARKETS closed mostly lower on Friday due to profit taking
ahead of the weekend. Today's sell off in the product markets was
triggered by rumors that President Bush will take early action to
provide relief from higher energy prices. Additional pressure came
from talk that other states will follow California and attempt to opt
out of the reformulated gasoline program.

June crude oil posted a quiet inside day with a slightly higher close
on Friday as it consolidated some of this week's gains. However, June
crude remains range bound leaving the door open for two-sided action.
Momentum indicators are neutral to bullish signaling that sideways to
higher prices near-term are possible. However, it will take closes
above 30.13 or below 26.75 to clear up near-term direction in the
market.

June heating oil closed lower on Friday due to profit taking
following Thursday's test of minor resistance crossing at 77.80.
Closes above this resistance level or below 73.10 are needed to
confirm a breakout of a three-week old trading range. Momentum
indicators are neutral to bullish hinting that sideways to higher
prices near-term are possible.

June unleaded gas closed sharply lower on Friday following rumors
that President Bush will take action to provide relief from high
gasoline prices. Friday's setback led to a test of this spring's
uptrend line crossing near 105.10. Multiple closes below the uptrend
line and last week's low crossing at 101.90 would confirm a top and
trendline breakout. Momentum indicators have been showing bearish
divergence, which is often a precursor to a top and trend change.

June Henry Hub natural gas posted a downside reversal on Friday
thereby ending Thursday's short covering bounce. Additional weakness
on Monday is needed to confirm today's bearish reversal pattern as
the door remains open for a test of the 75% retracement level of the
1999/2000 rally crossing at 3.625 later this spring. The rising ADX
signals that additional weakness during May is possible.

CURRENCIES The June Dollar closed higher on Friday thereby confirming
Thursday's key reversal up. Momentum indicators are bullish signaling
that additional gains are possible next week. If this month's rally
continues, this spring's double top crossing at 117.89 is June's next
target.

The June Swiss Franc and D-mark closed out the week at or near
session lows against the Dollar following the release of the latest
U.S. economic data. Both markets are poised to test their April lows,
which mark key support levels. Closes below these lows would confirm
a downside breakout of this spring's trading range while renewing the
larger-degree downtrends. Momentum indicators remain bearish
signaling that additional weakness near-term appears likely.

The June Canadian Dollar closed sharply lower on Friday after forming
a small bear flag earlier in the week. Today's resumption of the
decline off last Friday's high sets the stage for additional weakness
during the last half of May with April's conservative uptrend line
crossing near .6414 being the next likely downside target. Momentum
indicators remain bearish signaling that additional weakness
near-term is possible.

The June Japanese Yen closed steady on Friday in two- sided trading
as it consolidated some of this week's losses. Session lows fell just
short of testing April's uptrend line, which crosses near .8166.
Multiple closes below this support level would open the door for
sideways to lower prices during the last half of May. Momentum
indicators have turned bearish and warn traders that additional
weakness near-term is possible.

PRECIOUS METALS June gold closed lower on Friday as it extended
Thursday's setback due to light profit taking ahead of the weekend.
Nevertheless, this week's upside breakout of the 2000-01 downtrend
line has confirmed that a major bottom and trend change has taken
place. Momentum indicators remain bullish signaling that sideways to
higher prices near-term are possible. If this spring's rally
continues, March's high crossing at 276.20 is June's next upside
objective.

July silver posted an inside day with a lower close as it
consolidates above the lower boundary of this spring's trading range
crossing at 4.31. Closes below 4.31 are needed to confirm a trading
range breakout and trend change. However, momentum indicators are
oversold warning bears to use caution as a short-term bottom might be
in or near. Closes above this week's high at 4.425 are needed before
a low can be confirmed.

July copper posted an inside day with a higher close due to light
short covering following Thursday's test of April's low crossing at
75.60. Multiple closes below this support level are needed to confirm
a breakout and resumption of this spring's decline. If a breakout is
confirmed, weekly support crossing at 74.10 is July's next target.
Momentum indicators are bearish signaling that additional weakness
near-term is possible.

GRAINS July corn closed out the week on a low note and near session
lows due to spillover selling following Thursday's bearish
supply/demand report. This week's breakout below key weekly support
crossing at 2.02 has both renewed this year's decline and set the
stage for the next level of weekly support crossing at 1.91 1/2 later
this month. Today's losses were limited, as traders were cautious
ahead of Monday's planting progress report and this afternoon's
extended weather forecasts. Planting delays continue plague farmers
in the western Corn Belt while dry parts of the eastern Corn Belt
received some rains during the week. I would not be surprised to see
a short covering bounce on Monday however, the bearish tone that has
engulfed the corn market will continue to limit upside potential
near-term.

July wheat closed higher on Friday as the smaller- than-expected U.S.
winter wheat crop and all-wheat production forecasts from Thursday's
supply/demand report continues to underpin the market. Gains were
limited due to weakness in the corn market. Traders will be closely
watching Monday's planting progress and crop conditions reports for
near-term direction. Closes above broken trendline support crossing
near 2.72 would temper the bearish outlook in July wheat while
increasing the odds that this week's lows marked a double bottom.

SOYBEAN COMPLEX July soybeans closed fractionally higher on Friday
due to light short covering ahead of the weekend. However, Thursday's
bearish supply/demand report and corn planting delays in the western
Corn Belt continue to limit upside potential. Momentum indicators
have become overbought and are turning neutral to bearish signaling
that May's correction in time might have come to an end. I am looking
for sideways to lower soybean prices during the last half of May with
April's low being a possible target.

July soybean meal posted an inside day with a higher close on Friday
as it consolidated some of Thursday's losses. However, upside
potential remains limited in the face of bearish soybean
fundamentals. Momentum indicators have become overbought and are
turning neutral to bearish warning traders to use caution as this
spring's corrective rebound might have come to an end. Closes below
this week's low would likely trigger additional long-liquidation next
week.

LIVESTOCK June hogs closed steady on Friday, as gains were limited
due to sharp losses in bellies. Commercial buying prompted by strong
cash bids that were up $0.50 to $1.00 higher on the day supported
prices. Sluggish hog movement and inadequate packer inventories
continue to support the cash market, which has underpinned the
late-week rally. Technically, June hogs continue to rebound off the
2000-01 uptrend line, which is to be expected following April's sharp
decline. Until this support level is broken, this spring's setback is
nothing more than a correction within a bull market.

June cattle closed lower on Friday as it posted a downside reversal.
Session highs spiked above broken support crossing at 70.52.
Additional weakness on Monday is needed to confirm today's bearish
reversal pattern. If this spring's decline resumes, last September's
low at 69.72 then weekly support crossing at 69.25 are potential
targets. Both weekly and daily momentum indicators are bearish but
nearing their respective oversold zones hinting that an important low
might be near.

FOOD & FIBER July coffee posted a downside reversal on Friday erasing
Thursday's gains. Momentum indicators have become very overbought
warning traders to use caution as a short-term top might be in or
near. July's inability to fill March's gap at 70.25 underscores the
weak tone of the market. Closes below Thursday's low at 66.25 would
confirm that this spring's short covering bounce has likely come to
an end.

July cocoa posted a huge key reversal down on Friday due to profit
taking that erased much of this week's gains. Additional weakness on
Monday is needed to confirm today's bearish reversal pattern. From a
broader perspective, July cocoa needs to close above 1103 or below
955 to confirm a breakout of this spring's trading range.

July sugar closed modestly higher on Friday as it continues to form a
small symmetrical triangle. A breakout in either direction of this
consolidation formation will point the direction of the next trending
move. If this spring's rally resumes, January's high at 941 is July's
next target. Closes below this week's low at 890 would increase the
odds that a short-term top has likely been posted.

July cotton posted a key reversal up on Friday due to short covering
ahead of the weekend. Nevertheless, Friday's high did nothing more
than test broken support crossing at 45.50. Multiple closes above
this broken support level are needed to temper the bearish outlook in
the market. If this spring's decline continues, psychological support
crossing at 40 cents is July's next downside target later this month.

_____________________________________________________________________

June Nasdaq futures closed 26.50 lower at 1808.00 today. Prices hit a
fresh two-week low today, but have been trading sideways for several
weeks. The sideways trading favors the bulls, but they still have
some heavy lifting to do and their next upside objective is
resistance at the key 2,000 area. First support is seen at the 1,732
area.

June S&P 500 futures closed 0.20 higher at 1252.00. Same story:
Prices have leveled off the past four weeks, after rallying solidly
off the early-April low. This does favor the bulls, but not greatly.
Technically, bulls still need to push prices above the 1285
resistance area. My bias is still that any recovery in the stock
market and the stock indexes won't be dramatic, but a slower grind
higher, with fits and starts. First resistance is seen at 1285.00.
First support is seen at 1206.00.

LIVESTOCK: June live cattle closed $0.58 higher at 70.75 today.
Prices rebounded from a technically oversold condition today, and on
news that boxed beef prices had improved. Last week, prices hit a
fresh multi-month low. Still, prices are in an accelerating
two-month-old downtrend on the daily bar chart and bears have
control. Next support, basis June, is seen at $70.25. First
resistance comes in at the $71.00 level.

August feeder cattle closed off 22 cents today at $87.65. The rally
in the corn market today hurt feeders. If recent history continues to
play out in feeders, prices may dip a bit more, but the support area
of 87.40 will cap losses. That is the lower level of the trading band
in place for the past several weeks. If prices break down below the
bottom of the recent trading range, then the door is opened to a
lower trend down to the January low just above the $86.00 level. Next
resistance is seen at $88.00. First support is seen at $87.60 and
then at $87.40.

June lean hogs closed $0.25 higher at $68.80 today. Commercial buying
was seen in the futures pits, reports said. Price action today saw
more consolidation after the strong losses recorded in recent weeks.
But the bears still have the momentum on their side at present. Next
support lies at $67.00. First resistance is located at the 69.50
level.

GRAINS: July corn futures closed 4 1/2 cents higher at $2.01 3/4
today. Another "mini" weather scare popped prices today. Two
important things to point out here: One, July corn (now the nearby
contract) did not stay below the key $2.00-per-bushel level very
long. Secondly, notice how even some hot temps forecast for mid-May
popped prices higher. I suspect that with prices this low going into
the growing season, this type of knee-jerk reaction to any changes in
the weather patterns will be the norm. Still, bottom pickers should
beware. Next resistance is now seen at $2.04. Next support is seen at
$2.00.

July soybeans closed 7 1/2 cents higher at $4.43 1/4 today. Like
corn, beans were boosted by a "mini" weather scare and ideas that now
there may not be significant corn acres switched to soybeans.
Importantly, the bean market did not fare that badly, technically,
last week, in the face of the sell offs in corn and wheat futures.
Today's big upside push propelled prices to a fresh five-week high
and pushed prices above a stiff resistance area at $4.45. Bears still
have the advantage. It's going to take a "significant" weather scare
this spring or summer to force soybean prices solidly higher. First
resistance is now seen at the $4.50 area and then $4.55. First
support is now seen at $4.35.

July soybean meal closed up $3.60 at $159.40 today. Prices today
pushed to a fresh nearly three-month-high. Importantly, prices pushed
above the congestion area on the

daily bar chart that had contained gains for better than a week.
Recent price action is very encouraging to the bulls and is a solid
sign the lows are in place in the meal market. Next resistance comes
in at the $162.00 area. First support is seen at $156.00.

July bean oil closed 7 points higher at 14.73 cents today. Prices
scored another new contract low today of 14.62 cents. Oil is still
technically weaker than beans or meal right now. But I would be
surprised if there is much downside left in oil. Next resistance
comes in at 15.00 cents. Next support is seen at 14.50 cents.

July Chicago wheat gapped higher on the daily bar chart and closed 7
1/4 cents higher at $2.78 1/2 today. Hot and dry weather forecast for
the U.S. Plains states this week combined with a bullish USDA report
last Thursday to send prices sharply higher today. Now, odds have
increased that a double-bottom reversal on the daily bar chart will
be confirmed. The fact that wheat was technically oversold also led
to the stronger upside movement today. Prices last Wednesday touched
the contract low of $2.65. Bears still have the slight edge, but
bulls are gaining confidence rapidly. First resistance lies at the
$2.80 area. Next support is seen at $2.75.

SOFTS: July N.Y. sugar closed 9 points lower at 9.01 cents today.
Prices scored a bearish "outside day" down on the daily bar chart
today. We still could see a minor bullish pennant forming in sugar,
but prices would need to bounce right back higher soon. Bulls can
still correctly argue that today's pullback was just consolidation
amid good prices gains seen recently. A three-month high was scored
in July sugar just recently. A six-week-old uptrend line is still in
place on the daily bar chart. Next resistance now comes in at 9.15
cents--today's high. First support is seen at 8.80 cents.

July N.Y. coffee closed 3.40 cents lower at 64.25 cents today. Prices
gapped lower on the daily bar chart and let some of the air out of
the bulls' balloon. They had gained momentum lately. Not much
technical damage will occur if prices can rebound, but if good
follow-through selling occurs Tuesday, then odds significantly
increase that prices will test the recent lows. First support comes
in at 62 cents. First resistance is seen at 67.00 cents-- today's
high.

July N.Y. cocoa closed $10 higher today, at $1,024. Prices scored a
corrective "inside day" on the daily bar chart today, following
Friday's big sell off. The bears wanted to see follow-through selling
today to confirm a bearish key reversal down on the daily bar chart,
but that did not occur. Bulls and bears are still on a level playing
field. Next resistance comes in at $1,062. First support is now seen
at $1,000.

July cotton closed 153 points higher at 46.70 cents today. Hot and
dry weather in the cotton-growing regions of the U.S. combined with a
technically oversold condition on the market to push prices solidly
higher today. The cotton market will be like the grains. Prices are
so depressed that traders will be extra jumpy when any potentially
adverse weather patterns are forecast. There was good follow-through
buying today from Friday's "outside day" up on the daily bar chart,
and a key reversal up was confirmed. This gives the bulls a bit more
confidence. Cotton is still in a bear market and any rebounds may be
selling opportunities for the bears. Let's see what happens this
week. My bias is still that we are not that far from a bottoming
process. Next resistance lies at 48.00 cents. First support now is
seen around 45.00 cents. Would-be bottom-pickers should still beware.

July orange juice futures closed 30 points higher today, at 79.20
cents. Prices closed near the session high. Last week, bulls filled
an important downside gap area on the daily bar chart. They have
gained confidence after the recent price action, but will need to see
more upside action this week--pushing prices above 80 cents--to gain
solid momentum. Next resistance is seen at 80.00 cents. Next support
comes in at 77.60 cents--today's low.

July lumber futures closed the limit of $10.00 higher again today, at
$324.80. Prices today again gapped higher and hit a new for-the-move
high. Bulls are really snorting now. Expect more volatility, as is
typical for this market. The next upside objective for the bulls is
now the $330.00 area, and then $335.00. First support is seen at the
$315.00 area. This is a fun market to watch from the sidelines. But
the volatility can be a killer to those who are caught on the wrong
side of the lumber market.

METALS: June COMEX gold closed up $0.40 today, at $268.70. Prices
corrected a bit more today after last Wednesday's strong gains that
pushed prices to a two-month high. This market is in a nice uptrend
since scoring its early-April low. Recent price action is what bulls
needed to gain confidence to trek farther north on the chart. Next
resistance is located at $271.10--the recent high. First support is
seen at $266.00.

July silver closed up $0.02 today, at $4.357 an ounce. Same story:
Silver prices are not that far above the contract low. Prices are
chopping at lower levels, and this suggests a "basing" action that
many markets need to change the trend from down, to sideways, to
eventually up. Next support is seen at $4.30. First resistance is
seen at $4.425. Bears have the advantage.

July N.Y. copper closed 85 points lower today, at 75.50 cents. A
bearish U.S. economic report today pulled copper prices down to a new
contract low. The stock market and the U.S. economy will have to be
healthy before the bulls can really get something going in copper.
Next resistance is seen at 77.00 cents. Next support is seen at 75.00
cents.

ENERGIES: July crude closed $0.06 higher at $29.13 today. Bulls and
bears are still at a stand-off, but bulls will gain the edge on a
move above $29.50. Expect more choppy trading. Next support is seen
at 28.00. Next resistance lies at $29.50.

July heating oil closed 86 points lower today, at .7566. Bulls still
have the slight edge. Look for more choppy trading in the near
future. Next support is seen at 74.00 cents. Next resistance is seen
at 78.00 cents.

July unleaded gasoline closed 302 points lower at .9428 today. After
prices scored a new contract high last week, they have sold off
dramatically. The increase in volatility at higher price levels
suggests a topping process in the market. Bulls have lost their edge.
Next support is seen at $.9200. First resistance is seen at $.9600.

July natural gas closed 11.5 cents higher at $4.465 today. After,
prices hit a fresh five-and-one-half-month low last Wednesday, we've
seen corrective consolidation. Bears still have the edge. Next
support is seen at $4.20 and first resistance is at $4.60.

STOCKS, FINANCIALS, CURRENCIES: The June Euro currency closed 20
points lower at .8740 today. Prices pushed to another fresh four-week
low today. Bears have the edge. My bias is still that there is not
much downside left in the Euro, but the markets are always right, so
we'll see. Next support is now seen at .8700. Next resistance is seen
at .8850.

The June Japanese yen closed 47 points lower at .8143 today. Bears
are in control. Bulls are hoping for some "basing" activity at lower
levels, and that may be occurring, although it's too early to tell.
Next support now lies at the .8100 level. First resistance is seen at
the .8326 level.

The June Swiss franc closed 10 points lower at .5713. Bears are in
command. Prices pushed to a fresh 5.5-month low today, and took out
the mid-April low of .5702. If we see follow-through selling to push
prices significantly below today's low, that a bearish signal and
portends significantly more downside. A 4.5-month-old downtrend line
is in place on the daily bar chart, and it has accelerated recently.
Next support is seen at the .5700 level. First resistance comes in at
the .5800 level.

The June Australian dollar futures closed 22 points lower at .5193
today. Prices pushed to a fresh two-month high last Thursday and the
bulls have the advantage as a six- week-old uptrend line is in place
on the daily bar chart. First resistance is now seen at .5300. First
support is now seen at .5150.

The June Canadian dollar closed 4 points lower today, at .6444. Bulls
are losing momentum as prices correct from the push to the May high.
They still have the slight edge, on a short-term basis, but they will
lose it if they can't turn prices at least sideways this week. This
currency had been near recent historic lows and I do not think there
is much more downside. Next resistance is seen at the .6500 level.
First support is seen at the .6400 level.

The June British pound closed 4 points lower at 1.4182. Trading
continues choppy at lower levels. As prices approach the lower
portion of the recent trading range, strong support should kick in
and provide for a bounce. But if prices fall below the early April
low of 1.4112, then the door is open to much steeper losses. This
currency was not that far above recent historic lows and I do not
think there is much more downside in the sterling. One could still
argue that price action the past few weeks has been a "basing" before
prices eventually turn north. A move below 1.4100 would be considered
a bearish downside breakout. Next support is now seen at the 1.4112
level. Next resistance comes in at the 1.4270 level.

The June U.S. dollar index closed 24 points higher at 117.22 today.
Prices also pushed to a fresh four-week high again today. Next
resistance lies at the 117.70 level. First support is seen at the
115.50 area. My bias is still that there is not much upside left in
the dollar index. But this week technical odds have increased that a
new high will be scored. We'll see. Markets are never wrong--
analysts are.

June U.S. T-bonds closed 14/32 higher today at 99 20/32. Prices
scored a corrective "inside day" today after Friday's price crash to
a six-month low. All eyes are on this week's FOMC meeting, at which a
decision will be made on whether or not to cut interest rates.
Trading will likely be subdued up to the time of the announcement,
which is set to occur tomorrow afternoon. Short-term indicators show
the market is still overdone on the downside, but nobody should stand
in front of a steaming locomotive. Longer-term charts do show good
support at the 99 even area. First resistance is now seen at 100
even-- or "par."

The June U.S. T-note closed up 12.0 (32nds) today at 103.11.0. Prices
scored a corrective "inside day" after crashing to a five-month low
Friday. Bears have the edge now, as severe technical damage has been
inflicted this week. First support is seen at the 102.29.0 level.
First resistance is seen at 103.16.0 area.

Please check the gd swap cheyenne positions for March.  I am confident that I 
have cheyenne short positions on this month, but they are not showing up in

I would like to add electronic index descriptions to the database.  Please 
refernece Gas Daily publication, page three for the location of these 
indices.  We can simply insert the location of the electronic index where we 
currenly have the gas daily index survey language in the gd swaps in the 
database.  I would like to have electronic gd swaps for the following 
points.  El Paso Permian, El Paso , non-bondad, Kern River/Opal Plant, Socal 
Gas, large packages.  We will need to add electronic to the product title to 
differentiate between the two gd swaps.

Thanks,

NewPower to offer another pilot program to Houston employees


Free remote energy management solution helps you to manage rising energy 
bills.
NewPower is launching a revolutionary technology pilot to the first 500 
people to sign up in the Houston area.  The NewPower Connections Remote 
Energy Management Solution is a pilot program designed to give consumers 
control of their thermostat via the Internet.  The program will allow 
thermostats to be adjusted from anywhere, with any Internet-enabled device, 
including computers, web-enabled cell phones, palm OS devices, or pocket 
PCs.  Sears Home Central will install and service the Remote Energy 
Management Solution at no charge throughout the duration of the pilot 
program.  For a typical household, the three-month pilot could result in up 
to 10 percent to 15 percent utility bill savings, based on personal usage and 
the size of your home.  


Be among the first to participate absolutely free.
Enrollment with the NewPower Connections Remote Energy Management Solution 
pilot program starts May 14 and continues through the end of the month.  For 
more information about this offer, visit NewPower's table located in the 
Plaza of the Enron Building near the down escalator from 11:00 a.m. to 2 p.m. 
during the week of May 14.  To become a pilot participant you need only to be 
a homeowner in the Houston area and have Internet access.  You do not even 
have to be a NewPower electricity customer to participate.  For more 
information about NewPower Connections, send an e-mail to 
connections@newpower.com.


Disclaimers:
Any contract for goods or services that is entered into by an Enron employee 
with respect to the NewPower program shall be solely between NewPower and 
such employee.  Enron assumes no obligation on behalf of NewPower and makes 
no representations, warranties, or guaranties with respect to NewPower, any 
goods or services offered or provided by NewPower.  Home.Enron.com

Matt, your new responsibility for 7:30 meeting will be to go over all gen 
outages in the west by region and fuel type, and to discuss the previous days 
gen numbers and load forecasts.  Including pricing info and heat rates from 
the Portland guys and/or Megawatt Daily will also help.  Effective on 
Thursday.

Thanks,

interest.

Questar just (within the last month) bought the development rights fully from 
Beta Energy.  They have drilled one salt test well and have extensively 
tested the salt.  They HAVE NOT tested the disposal zones as yet and that is 
a critical component.

They are planning on developing four caverns for a total of 14 Bcf working 
gas. First caverns should be available in about 2 years.  At that time they 
will abandon the three small reservoirs on their system and replace the 
deliverability and services with the Yellow Creek Facility.

We have initiated conversations with them regarding providing base gas as 
well as horsepower.

Fixing the PG&E topock curve to Socal less .25 would only allocate more 
positive income to the transport.  The position at topock is short.  I am not 
sure if this is the problem from Friday.  Let's get together in the morning.  
Thanks for the email.

Sincerely,
Mike

Good morning.  I am going to unavailable for the interviews on Monday.  The 
continued Califonia energy crisis and Enron's gas positions will not allow me 
to leave the desk on Monday.  I apologize for the inconvenience, but my time 
must be spent in the office.  Please let me know how I may be able to assist 
the interview process in the future.  I am always willing to help out when I 
have the time.

Sincerely,

Mike Grigsby

????? <p>Dear Jennifer,</p> 

<!-- Copy in each day's wrap up specifics after this point. --> 

<p>Two large mergers are done deals.? Valero Energy is buying rival Ultramar 
Diamond Shamrock for $4 billion in cash and the assumption of $2 billion in 
debt today.? The acquisition creates the second-largest refiner of petroleum 
products in the U.S. Williams Energy, parent company of ENL, also completed 
a $2.8 billion deal to buy Denver-based Barrett Resources.? The deal more 
than doubles Williams' natural gas reserves, and now makes Williams a 
producer and distributor of natural gas.? Today ENL brought you interviews 
with the CEOs from all four companies.? If you happened to miss it, log onto 
the ENL website and click on "video library" to see the interviews in full. 
<p>ENL's Washington Bureau Chief Jay Cranford leaves for California early 
tomorrow.? Jay is scheduled to cover the meeting between California Gov. 
Gray Davis and 12 energy companies.? The agenda of the meeting will include 
discussion of unpaid debts, credit and the supply of power in California. 
Log on for updates from California with ENL's Jay Cranford. 
<p>Tomorrow, the Houston bureau will report on the Rig Insight Company.? Kim 
Benestante tells us this company offers a web-based platform where other 
companies can access rig data such as day-rates and availability.? Be sure 
to catch this report from Houston tomorrow.? Later in the week, Kim will 
take a trip to Texas Southern University for an interview with Dr. Joshua 
Hill to talk about the University's solar technology department.? Kim says 
TSU has the largest solar lab facility in the South, and produces solar 
panels for use all over the world.? Log on Friday when ENL sheds some light 
on the solar panel issue. 
<p>Coming up tomorrow, Cook Inlet's Gregory Craig is scheduled to join us 
from our Houston bureau.? Craig will be in to discuss Cook Inlet's joint 
venture with Mirant.? We'll bring you all the details in the 10:00 a.m. EST 
broadcast. 
<p>This is a dynamic industry and things are subject to change at a moment's 
notice.? Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.? We'll continue to 
do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events. 
<p>Keep it on <a href="http://www.energynewslive.com/">energynewslive.com</a>

		Dear Mike,
		
		Two large mergers are done deals.  Valero Energy is buying rival Ultramar 
Diamond Shamrock for $4 billion in cash and the assumption of $2 billion in  
debt today.  The acquisition creates the second-largest refiner of petroleum 
products in the U.S. Williams Energy, parent company of ENL, also completed  
a $2.8 billion deal to buy Denver-based Barrett Resources.  The deal more  
than doubles Williams' natural gas reserves, and now makes Williams a  
producer and distributor of natural gas.  Today ENL brought you interviews  
with the CEOs from all four companies.  If you happened to miss it, log onto 
the ENL website and click on "video library" to see the interviews in full.  
		
		ENL's Washington Bureau Chief Jay Cranford leaves for California early  
tomorrow.  Jay is scheduled to cover the meeting between California Gov.  
Gray Davis and 12 energy companies.  The agenda of the meeting will include  
discussion of unpaid debts, credit and the supply of power in California.  
Log on for updates from California with ENL's Jay Cranford.  
		
		Tomorrow, the Houston bureau will report on the Rig Insight Company.  Kim 
Benestante tells us this company offers a web-based platform where other  
companies can access rig data such as day-rates and availability.  Be sure  
to catch this report from Houston tomorrow.  Later in the week, Kim will  
take a trip to Texas Southern University for an interview with Dr. Joshua  
Hill to talk about the University's solar technology department.  Kim says  
TSU has the largest solar lab facility in the South, and produces solar  
panels for use all over the world.  Log on Friday when ENL sheds some light  
on the solar panel issue.  
		
		Coming up tomorrow, Cook Inlet's Gregory Craig is scheduled to join us  from 
our Houston bureau.  Craig will be in to discuss Cook Inlet's joint  venture 
with Mirant.  We'll bring you all the details in the 10:00 a.m. EST  
broadcast.  
		
		This is a dynamic industry and things are subject to change at a moment's 
notice.  Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to 
do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.

Mike,

I am not sure what role you might have played on the below Sitara deals since 
they are EOL deals so bare with me.

It looks as though all of Calpine's physical gas deals have been moved over 
to Calpine Energy Services (CES).  In other words, they have billed all gas 
under the CES entity for Apr-01 production.  However, it looks as though 
these deals were booked in EOL.  If that is the case, can you confirm that a 
Clapine trader actually entered these deals?  If so, do you know who that 
trader is?  If not, what can be done to change the counterparty name on these 
deals to Calpine Energy Services?  Any help would be appreciated.

Hello Everyone

It is a beautiful day here in the outskirts of Chicago. The
sun is shining, the birds are chirping and can you believe
the Chicago Cubs are actually in first place. That is truly
a miracle. Maybe with all this luck in the air, I should
run out and buy a lottery ticket. So, if I am not here tom-
orrow, you know I quit my job to run and buy a condo in the
Bahamas, and drink Margaritas by the sea. Hey, a girl can
still dream, can't she? ;)

Keep those brain waves churning!

Janie

TODAY'S TEASE (#740) [The Mammoth Puzzle Carnival]

This puzzle tests your powers of observation. It's so tough
it'll knock you into the middle of next week," warns Lateral
Larry.

"Here is a series of six words. They don't seem to have any-
thing in common. Yet, there is one word, and only one word,
that will continue the hidden logic."

"I'll even tell you that the word I am looking for is the
name of a season in the Christian calendar. Now does that

What word finishes the sequence?

COSMONAUT

At least one answer to today's tease:

WHITSUNTIDE, because all of the words have an abbreviation
for a day of the week in the middle of them, i.e. cosMONaut,
staTUEtte, sWEDe, enTHUse, and so on.
[I am sure some of you will seek to prove Lateral Larry
wrong and that there is more than one right answer. Let me
know if you have any luck. :)]

********************* Readers Comments *********************

Hi Janie,

For what it's worth, the answer to the riddle you published
was correct. The calculation is called a geometric series,
which can be summated over an infinite number of terms. Just
as it is impossible for the rabbit to stick its head out of
both sides of the box simultaneously, so is it impossible
for it to do anything in an infinitely small measure of time.

However, THEORETICALLY (and that's all we're talking here),
if you could keep splitting 1 minute by halves down to an
infinitely small measure, your last measure would be 0 (after
an infinity of splits). Therefore the sum of these times
would be 2, the initial minute, plus the half minute, quarter
minute and so on to infinity.

As Buzz Lightyear might say - "To infinity AND BEYOND!"

Cheers

P.S. What's more of a puzzle is why your readers don't know
the difference between "its" and "it's".

                            ****

The rabbit in the log tease is a direct reference to one
of Zeno of Eleas  four paradoxes. Zenos first parodox was
that all motion was impossible because in order to reach
your destination you must first reach the halfway point.
Then treat the halfway point as the new starting point and
repeat the logic, ie the next step you must reach the 1/4
pont, then the 1/8 point... ect. using this logic it is
impossible for anything to ever move anywhere. Whats the
problem with this logic? It dosn't allow for a fundamental
aspect of calculus, that of infinity and zero. So if you
were in calculus 101 class and they gave you the rabbit
in the log tease as a home work problem you whold know to
take limit of the sum of 1+1/2n as n goes to infinity and
come up with the answer that the rabbit will have its head
out of both sides of the log as a time of 2 minutes. Its
some how good to know that a self-taught counrty boy who
proposed his paradoxes around 500 BC is still baffleing
people 2500 years later! love the teases, Cris

                            ****

Cute pun, but a rabbit and a hare are different animals.
The defining difference being that a hare's young are born
with their eyes open, with hair and able to hop a little
shortly after birth, whereas a rabbit is born hairless
(hareless? sorry couldn't resist!) blind and helpless.
Hares:
http://www.britannica.com/eb/article?eu=3D40059&tocid=3D0
Rabbits: http://www.britannica.com/eb/article?eu=3D63924
A lot of the times the names are used for the wrong animal,
for instance, the Blacktailed Jackrabbit is actually a
hare, and the Belgian Hare is really a rabbit.

A Jane Barbe Fan club
When I found out the Jane Barbe was the one that made
that recording of all thouse Time messages.  I sent a message
to all my relative and friends that I was starting up a Jane
Barbe Fan club. And heres why!

She did a remarkable job I listen to every one of her time
messages this morning and last night and you would thing you
might hear her taking a drink of water or eating a bite of
food. But she was flawless.  I had a hard time staying awake
for 24 hours as she did that whole thing. My ear could only
make it for 4 hours before I got the Idea to put it on the
speaker phone.

How old is she do you have any auto graphed pictures ?
Thank You
Leland
[I am sorry I don't have any other information on her. I am
sure if she is out there and reading this, she will be very
honored to have such a devoted fan. :)]

[And thank you all for writing in. I hope to hear more from
all of you in the future! :)]

Are we confident that the gda priced positions are not being represented in 
my newcurrentday position sheet?  I know that Phillips triggered their 
volumes back to GDA equivalent and that Matt Lenhart bought some GDA malin 
gas.  How do we keep these from showing up in the physical risk?

Thank you for the summary.  Where can we find a detailed summary of the gas 
cost mechanism?  Are we confident that it is an average of all border points 
into CA?  If the real time price is capped at the least efficient generator, 
then what happens if this genertor can only buy Socal daily gas?  This 
avergae CA gas price will lead to a tighter heat rate for the generators, 
since the spread between Malin and Socal has reached $7.00 at times.

Thank you,
Mike Grigsby

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
? California's Bond Inevitability
? Davis Faces Even Greater Financial Woes
? California's Creditor Status Debated by Court
? Windfall Profits Tax Bill (SB 1X/AB 128X) Passes Senate Vote, Davis 
expected to Sign Off

California Bond Battle
SB 31X passed the Senate today by a simple majority vote, initiating the 90 
day wait period on the revenue bonds issuance.  Sources indicate that 
contrary to media reports, a possible referendum on the SB 31X would be 
unlikely for Harvey Rosenfield to produce within 90 days due to insufficient 
funding.  He reportedly would need to raise $250,000 - $500,000 very 
quickly.  Sources believe that it is more likely that Harvey will attempt to 
set up an initiative later this year or in 2002.

Davis Financial Woes Just Beginning
It is unclear whether Governor Davis truly will be able to move money around 
within the state budget to cover power purchases until August.  Of the $13.4 
billion bond amount authorized, approximately $6.7 billion has already been 
spent on power.  It is likely that the state will spend more than the 
remaining $6.7 billion on power before the bonds are even issued.  Sources 
indicate that most of the long-term contracts Davis talks about are unsigned 
and not really in place.  This means that the state may still have to 
purchase the majority of power on the spot market, which further complicates 
the situation.  As reported earlier, this explains why the Republicans wanted 
to wait for Davis to disclose the terms of the contracts before authorizing 
the bond issuance.  Given the lack of contracts in place, it appears that the 
bridge loan and the bonds will be inadequate for all of the state's power 
purchases.

"To Be or Not to Be," Is California a Creditor? 
Sources indicate that lawyers and members of the generator community 
reviewing California's revenue bond bill SB 31X, are unclear as to whether 
the state of California has claims as a creditor.  It appears at this time, 
that the Assembly re-wrote Senator Bowen's language so that the bill relies 
on the existing interpretation of AB 1X as to when the state gets paid by the 
utilities.  This exact issue is currently being reviewed in the PG&E 
bankruptcy case and will most likely settle this ongoing dispute between 
legislatures and utilities.

Windfall Profits Tax
According to sources, the windfall profits tax bill, SB 1X, still remains in 
committee in the Assembly.  It is unclear if this bill could be brought to a 
vote tomorrow given that each house has not reviewed the other's version of 
the bill.  Sources further indicate that the Senate version SB 1X, has not 
yet been referred to an Assembly policy committee and that a "significant 
reconciliation process" between the two bills must occur.  For example, 
unlike the Senate version, the Assembly version reportedly does not set a 
price cap based on a firm dollar amount, but instead leaves the decision up 
to a regulatory committee such as the PUC.  Once the bond issuance passes the 
Senate and is officially authorized, the state will likely be able to get its 
bridge loan from the lenders.  However, sources indicate that the bridge loan 
is "dead" unless the Senate moves before Thursday.

After continuing to play musical chairs with the west eol products, I think 
we have decided on a plan.  Keith and Frank will handle the prompt and term 
basis.  This includes the monthly basis, daily basis, and gd index for SJ, 
ROX, Scal, CG, and Malin.   They will make certain that the gd index products 
are out there for all terms.  Cary Metz is managing the Perm products.

I will handle the prompt month physical fixed price and index for all of the 
index points.  The term physical index will be coming soon.

The rest of the group will continue to manage their cash index points for the 
next day trading, while adding the BOM physical with a basis link to 
Monique's GD BOM products.  I would like to get the cash products out on eol 
by 7:15 each morning.  The early info will come in handy as we approach 
winter.  Let me know what you think.   Steve and Matt have started a pilot 
program in the NW for rolling out their next day cash products after 11:00 am 
each day.  We will look into rolling out the SW in the future.

We are in the process of sending out the "odd lot" notice to our customers 
regarding all products on eol.  We will change our product minimum to one 
mmbtu in the next week.  You may want to discuss this with your direct 
customers before the mailout.    

With the addition of Olivia Newton-John to my Scour selection, it is no 
secret that we have a new commitment to physical in the west.  If you review 
your customer contact sheet and discover an old customer that we haven't 
contacted in some time, then call them and visit.  We will be using EOL and 
the brokers for physical volumes, but nothing beats the direct phone call for 
the baseload phys.

Thanks,

Mike

Thank you for the information.  The links seem to be duplicates.  Let me know 
if you meant to send another link for the product.  I'll call you after I

Hello.  Are you saying that under no circumstances can you upgrade the memory 
on this desktop pc?  The technician said that it would simply take another 
memory design.  Let me know when you have the right memory available to

E X T R E M E   M A R K E T   C O M M E N T A R Y
_____________________________________________________________________

The stock market closed mixed today. June Nasdaq prices are still
within striking distance of the April high of 1995. Sideways trading
the past week has negated a fledgling four-week-old uptrend on the
daily bar chart. Bulls still have some heavy lifting to do and their
next upside objective is resistance at the key 2,000 area. First
support is seen at the 1,732 area. June S&P 500 futures closed firmer
today. Prices have leveled off the past week, after rallying solidly
off the early-April low. Technically, bulls still need to push prices
above the 1285 resistance area. My bias is still that any recovery in
the stock market and the stock indexes won't be dramatic, but a
slower grind higher, with fits and starts. First resistance is seen
at 1285.00. First support is seen at 1206.00.

LIVESTOCK: June live cattle closed 2 cents higher at 71.12. Prices
closed at the session low and managed to fill an upside gap on the
daily bar chart that was created in early trading. The market saw
another upside corrective bounce earlier today, after punching to a
fresh 6.5-month low last Friday. The bears are in control of the
market. Prices are still trading below an accelerating two-month-old
downtrend line on the daily bar chart. The market is still a bit
short-term oversold, and I would not be surprised to see more of an
upside correction this week. Next support, basis June, is seen at
$71.00. First resistance now comes in at the $72.00 level.

August feeder cattle closed up 3 cents today at $88.25. Prices closed
at the session low today. Range-bound trade continues. As this market
neared the bottom end of the recent trading range, which is around
$87.50, the market again took an upside bias. Look for more choppy
trading between $89 and $87.50. If prices can break out of that
aforementioned range, the direction of the breakout will likely be
the direction of the next significant trend. Next resistance is seen
at $88.70-- today's high. First support is seen at $88.00.

June lean hogs closed $0.15 higher today, at $67.50. Prices are still
showing consolidation at lower levels, after the sell off last week.
Hogs are still a bit overdone on the downside, on a short-term basis,
so some more corrective upside consolidation would not surprise me.
Still, the bears have the strong momentum on their side at present.
Next support lies at $66.25. First resistance is located at the 68.15
level--today's high.

GRAINS: July corn futures closed off 3 cents at $2.05 today. Crop
progress reports out Monday evening showing very good planting
progress in the U.S. weighed on the corn market today. There is just
not much bullish fundamental news in the corn market right now. The
weak wheat market is also weighing on corn. On Monday, respected Iowa
State University Climatologist Elwynn Taylor predicted record yields
for the Corn Belt this year. It would not surprise me to see the
commodity funds make another significant downside assault on the corn
and bean markets in the near term. Next support is now seen at $2.00.
Next resistance is seen at the $2.07 1/2 level--today's high.

July soybeans closed 2 3/4 cents higher at $4.40 1/2 today. Prices
are consolidating the recent gains, but bulls still by no means have
any significant momentum. Fundamentally, there is not much in the way
of good news for bulls right now. I would not be surprised to see the
commodity funds make another downside push in beans in the near term.
This market is still in technical trouble and it's going to take a
significant weather scare this spring or summer to force prices
solidly higher. First resistance is seen at the $4.45 area and then
$4.50. First support is seen at $4.35 and then at $4.30.

July soybean meal closed off $1.10 at $155.70 today. Prices this week
are showing a corrective pullback after they pushed to a fresh
eight-week high last Friday. Recent price action is still encouraging
to the bulls and is a sign the lows are in place in the meal market.
Next resistance comes in at the $158.50 area. First support is seen
at $154.00.

July bean oil closed 22 points higher at 15.09 cents today. Prices
saw a corrective bounce today after dropping to a new contract low of
14.76 cents on Monday. This market is technically much weaker than
beans or meal, and is still a bit overdone on the downside, on a
short-term basis. I would be surprised if there is much downside left
in oil. Next resistance comes in at 15.25 cents. Next support is seen
at the contract low of 14.76 cents.

July Chicago wheat closed 2 1/2 cents lower at $2.66 3/4 today.
Prices poked to a new contract low of $2.65. More rain in the Plains
has cast a bearish pall over the market. With the wheat crop behind
schedule anyway, the recent rains could allow the crop to make some
good improvement. Bears are in full command. Just last week, prices
pushed to a fresh six-week high. Serious technical damage has
occurred the past few sessions. First support lies at the contract
low of $2.65. Next resistance is seen at $2.70. This market is
short-term oversold and I suspect we'll see a corrective bounce soon.

SOFTS: July N.Y. sugar closed 18 points higher at 9.10 cents today.
We could see a bull flag starting to form in sugar, on the daily bar
chart. This many times occurs as prices consolidate steep gains. A
three-month high was scored in July sugar late last week. The bulls
have good momentum and a steep and accelerating five-week-old uptrend
line is still in place on the daily bar chart. Next resistance now
comes in at 9.25 cents. First support is now seen at 8.80 cents.

July N.Y. coffee closed 15 points higher at 68.90 cents today. Prices
pushed to another fresh two-month high today as the bulls continue to
gain momentum. This recent move is the most significant showing by
the bulls since mid-January. The fact that prices have not sold off
sharply the past three sessions is encouraging for the bulls,
too--given recent price history. Still, the bears could be setting a
trap, like they did in early January. If bulls can push prices above
70 cents and then see follow-through strength, bears will begin to
think this uptrend is sustainable. First resistance comes in at 70
cents. First support is seen 65.00 cents.

July N.Y. cocoa closed $55 higher today, at $1,044. Today's strong
gap-higher trade on the daily bar chart put the bulls back on a level
playing field with the bears in a hurry. Prices pushed above and
negated a 2.5-month-old downtrend line on the daily bar chart. Next
resistance comes in at $1,050 and then $1,060. First support is now
seen at today's low of $1,001.

July cotton closed 99 points lower at 45.44 cents today. Cotton is in
a strong bear market, and a new contract low was scored just today,
at 45.40 cents. Right now, any rebounds are likely to be just selling
opportunities for the bears. But, my bias is still that we are not
that far from a bottoming process. Next support lies at 45.00 cents.
First resistance is seen around 48.00 cents. Would-be bottom-pickers
should beware. Bulls need to watch for some "basing" action, which
may be beginning.

July orange juice futures closed 45 points lower today, at 76.95
cents. Prices late last week probed into an important gap area on the
daily bar chart, which begins at 77.85 cents, but did not fill that
gap on the upside. Bears rule and the market is still technically
weak. However, if the aforementioned gap can be filled on the upside,
that's an important first step for the bulls in turning the market
around. That gap will be filled if prices move above 78.55 cents,
which is first resistance. Next support comes in at 76.00 cents.

July lumber futures closed $2.60 lower at $308.40 today. Prices just
Monday hit yet a new for-the-move high, at $313.20, as the bull
market roars on. Today's price action is just some healthy
consolidation in a bull market. Expect more volatility, however, as
is typical for this market. The next upside objective for the bulls
is the $315.00 area. First support is seen at the $300.00 area. This
market is still short-term overbought, technically, and I would not
be surprised to see a decent downside correction soon.

METALS: June COMEX gold closed down $1.00 today, at $265.50. Prices
late last week pushed to a new seven-week high. Despite recent choppy
trading, this market is still trending up from its early-April low.
But bulls need to see some solid upside movement soon to keep what
momentum they have recently gained. But the fact that prices have not
sold way off after the rally is encouraging to the bulls. Next
resistance is located at $268. First support is seen at $264.00.

July silver closed up $0.008 today, at $4.335 an ounce. Prices are
not that far above the contract low. Still, prices are chopping at
lower levels. This suggests a "basing" action that many markets need
to change the trend from down, to sideways, to eventually up. Next
support is seen at $4.30. First resistance is seen at $4.41. Bears
still have the advantage.

July N.Y. copper closed 1.80 cents lower today, at 76.85 cents. Stock
market weakness helped drive this market lower today. Prices are
still attempting to build a base and recover from the early-April
low. My bias is still that the downside is limited for copper. The
stock market and the U.S. economy will have to be healthy before the
bulls can really get something going in copper, however. Next
resistance is seen at 78.00 cents. Next support is seen at 76.00
cents.

ENERGIES: July crude closed $0.19 lower at $28.35 today. Bulls and
bears are at a stand-off and will duke it out over the near term.
Expect more choppy trading. Next support is seen at 28.00. Next
resistance lies at $29.50.

July heating oil closed 30 points higher today, at .7551. Bulls still
have the slight edge, but look for more choppy trading in the near
future. Next support is seen at 73.00 cents. Next resistance is seen
at 77.50 cents.

July unleaded gasoline closed 128 points lower at .9898 today. Prices
scored a new contract high just Monday, and saw follow-through
selling today. That confirms a key reversal in this market. But given
the recent volatility in unleaded, I am not placing a lot of emphasis
on this key reversal. Bulls are still in command as peak driving
season nears. Top-pickers beware! Next resistance is seen at $1.03.
First support is seen at $.9600.

July natural gas closed 3.6 cents higher at $4.35 today. Today was
just an upside correction in a steep downtrend. Prices hit a fresh
five-and-one-half-month low Monday. Next support is seen at $4.25 and
first resistance is now at $4.50. This market is still short-term
oversold, technically.

FINANCIALS, CURRENCIES: The June Euro currency closed 62 points lower
at .8828 today. Bears have the decided edge again as bulls have lost
all the momentum they had gained in mid-April. My bias is still that
there is not much downside left in the Euro. Look for more choppy
action in the near term. Bulls will again gain good momentum if they
can push prices above the .9075 area. Next support is now seen at
.8800. Next resistance is seen at .9000.

The June Japanese yen closed 5 points lower at .8279 today. Prices
pushed to a fresh six-week high last Friday, but bears are still in
control. Bulls are hoping for some "basing" activity at lower levels,
and that may be occurring, although it's too early to tell. Next
support now lies at the .8100 level. First resistance is seen at the
.8326 level.

The June Swiss franc closed 36 points lower today, at .5739. Bears
are in command. Still, my bias is that prices won't deteriorate much
more. Next support is seen at the .5700 level. First resistance comes
in at the .5830 level.

The June Australian dollar futures closed 37 points lower at .5150
today. Prices pushed to a fresh two-month high late last week and are
consolidating a bit this week. The bulls still have the advantage as
a five-week-old uptrend line is in place on the daily bar chart. My
bias is that the lows are in place. First resistance is now seen at
.5250. First support is now seen at .5100.

The June Canadian dollar closed 14 points lower today, at .6464.
Prices sold off some more today after the key reversal down on the
daily bar chart that was scored Monday. Bulls had good momentum, but
have lost some the past two sessions. The key reversal does not
indicate prices are headed back toward the lows seen a few weeks ago.
What it does suggest is a decent downside correction to the recent
gains will occur over the near term. This currency had been near
recent historic lows and I do not think there is much more downside.
Next resistance is seen at the .6548 level. First support is seen at
the .6450 level.

The June British pound closed 126 points lower at 1.4244. Trading
continues choppy at lower levels. This currency was not that far
above recent historic lows and I do not think there is much more
downside in the sterling. One could argue that price action the past
few weeks has been a "basing" before prices eventually turn north. A
move above the 1.4500 level would be considered a bullish "upside
breakout" from the recent congestion area. Next support is now seen
at the 1.4200 level. Next resistance comes in at the 1.4400 level.

The June U.S. dollar index closed 75 points higher at 116.24 today.
Bulls are regaining momentum. The recent double-top reversal on the
daily bar chart still favors the bears longer-term. Next resistance
lies at the 116.50 level. First support is seen at the 114.50 area.
My bias is still that a near-term top is in place in the dollar
index.

June U.S. T-bonds closed 17/32 lower today at 101 21/32. Prices
scored a bearish "outside day" down on the daily bar chart today,
whereby the high was higher and the low was lower than the previous
session's trading range, with a lower close. Bulls need to show some
resolve soon, after pushing prices well off the lows scored in late
April. A steep six-week-old downtrend line was penetrated on the
upside last week and negated. Also, a minor double-bottom reversal
has occurred on the daily bar chart. Next resistance is seen at 103
9/32. First support is seen at 101 even.

Sorry.  The topock curve should be marked as Socal flat.  Remember that we 
show the differentials in index spreads.  Please make certain that the pg&e 
topock curves are flat to socal in the future.  Can we run a report showing 
the curveshift spread between the two points since Jan 1, 2001?  Thanks.

Anne,

After NX1 going forward, I would like to load my final positions in the 
LIQBasis tab in NCD.  The positions will include basis, physindex and gd 
index positions.  We can then run settlement index scenarios to see what my 
risk will be to index postings.  This will be a huge benefit.

Gracias,
Mike

Good morning.  With the energy crisis in California at this time, we will 
need to be extra careful with nominations at Socal and throughout the west to 
ensure that we continue to provide the excellent nomination service that we 
have been providing to our customers.  You guys are doing an excellent job 
and we understand that you are under quite a bit of pressure with limited 
staff.  Our contracts state that we must notify every customer of  pipeline 
allocations 12 hours in advance.  We all know that this can be almost 
impossible on EPNG, but because of the current price levels at Socal and the 
basins, Enron needs to call each customer and notify them of their cuts with 
an explanation of the pipeline cuts each day to avoid any potential 
penalties.  We also need to document when the call was made.  In regards to 
the ATM nominations on Socal (ones that we can't monitor), Enron will be 
requesting full pipeline summaries of the nominations from our 
counterparties.  Please try to think of any nomination gaming that may take 
place at these historical levels.  We need to remember that our 
counterparties may not act as they have in the past due to the market price 
implications on their P&L.  We should not rely on prior business conduct in 
regards to "standard epng allocations" when dealing with our customers.  I 
would expect that the market is going to overreact to any cuts that may be 
above the "pipeline average".

Let's discuss how we are going to monitor the flows of nominations out of our 
control.  How do we prevent collusion with respect to the socal nominations 
that we can't see?  Are there package numbers on each baseload contract to 
ensure that they don't simply reshuffle gas according to price? Let me know 
which companies are not providing Enron with timely allocation reports at 
Socal and I will call their senior trader to discuss getting this operational 
information sooner.

Sincerely,

Mike

Sources report that the bond authorization will be put to a vote today

The bridge loan financing bill will put to a vote today in the California 
Assembly.  The bill would pass with a simple majority as a non-urgency bill, 
meaning the bill would not take effect for 90 days.  The state would be 
forced to abandon its proposed bridge loan plans.  Absent of last minute 
financial rescues by Davis or a new longer bridge loan package (unlikely) 
Socal could seek voluntary bankruptcy.  The main problem now will be the 
waiting period for financial relief from the state through the transmission 
line purchase or other assistance.

I created the term gd basis products for waha, perm, sj, opal, and malin this 
weekend.  Call Dale or Melba to activate.  Keith and I briefly discussed how 
we would handle the new responsibility.  I am fine with managing the prompt 
month gd basis, while you guys manage the term.  I will be back in the office 
this week and we can talk about the products.  Would we handle the monthly 
the same way?  When do we plan to phase the monthly out?  Have Phillip manage 
the perm and waha basis until I return.  

Dale is also working on the Baja and Redwood on/off system spreads.  We can 
roll these out for all terms as well.

See you this week.

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~* Daily Riddle ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

Today's Riddle is -


A rich man's son was kidnapped. The ransom note told him to bring
a valuable diamond to a phone booth in the middle of a public park.
Plainclothes police officers surrounded the park, intending to follow
the criminal or his messenger. The rich man arrived at the phone booth
and followed instructions but the police were powerless to prevent
the diamond from leaving the park and reaching the crafty villain.
What did he do?




As always, you will find the answer below today's sponsor.

The answer to today's Riddle is -

This is a true story from Taiwan. When the rich man reached the phone
booth he found a carrier pigeon in a cage. It had a message attached
telling the man to put the diamond in a small bag which was around the
pigeon's neck and to release the bird. When the man did this the police
were powerless to follow the bird as  it returned across the city to
its owner.

Ina,

Passport will probably need to be set up on Mike's desktop by an IT person. 
Most of the time they have to copy the application from my desktop
to make it work. For Gasselect, I will check with Mike and see if it is 
working. I believe all he needs is the login ID and password to make that 
work.
If you need anything else, let me know.

Investigation into trubine bearing damage and possible Unit Auxiliary

V.P. Russ Krieger came over the PA to say "Yahoo San Onofre!" for a job
well done in getting the outage done in 32 days (breaker to breaker, so to
speak). He went on to say that it is not known if the fault was related to
outage work, or if there will be an effect on our outage bonus. He said
we'll be of line for several weeks. I'd say at least that since our turbine
ground to a halt with no DC lube oil, and is still cooling with no jacking.

Anne, it looks like the socal position for socal is incorrect.  The position 
looks much smaller than it did today.  Please check to see if Patti made 
changes to deals in sitara.

The position sheet from yesterday afternoon, close of business, is quite 
different than the position posted in newcuurentday for 11/29.  What do you 
think the difference is?  The SJ, Perm, and Socal don't match.  Are we 
booking them correctly.  Let me know.  

Ask Anne to reconcile each day with comments on the prompt tab.

Thanks,
Mike

As noted in my  last e-mail, the Ray Nixon expansion project in Colorado had 
the incorrect start date.  My last report showed an online date of May 2001; 
the actual anticipated online date is May 2003.
 
The following list ranks the quality and quantity of information that I have 
access to in the WSCC:

 1) CA - siting office, plant contacts
 2) PNW - siting offices, plant contacts
 3) DSW - plant contacts, 1 siting office for Maricopa County Arizona.
 4) Colorado - Integrated Resource Plan

If anyone has additional information regarding new generation in the Desert 
Southwest or Colorado, such as plant phone numbers or contacts, I would 
greatly appreciate receiving this contact information.

The Gas Daily basis issue should be worked out between your desk and the 
monthly basis desk.  We are making markets on GD basis for every term and 
index point.  This creates a nice market for term gd index.  Let us know how 
you guys would like to cover the gd basis with us.  The real opportunity for 
gd basis is at socal, where the monthly index is so unreliable.

Patti, will you please review each of the SW Gas deals on this spreadsheet 
and let me know which deals they penalized us for?  We are looking to see if 
they have been penalizing multiple deals or one deal in particular.  They 
claim that all one month deals fall under an IT contract that cannot be 
penalized.  I want to make certain that they did not penalize one month deals.

Thanks,
mike

About Coppelia
Copp,lia was first performed on May 25, 1870 at the Th,atre Imp,rial de 
L'Op,ra, featuring choreography by Arthur Saint-L,on and music by L,o 
Delibes. The work maintains a special place in the history of dance, serving 
as a kind of bridge from the glory of the French Romantic ballet in the early 
nineteenth century to the masterpieces of the Russian Imperial Theater at the 
turn of the century. Writing in The International Dictionary of Ballet, 
critic Karen Dacko analyzes the unique characteristics of the piece as 
follows: "Copp,lia owes its longevity to its inspired, very danceable score. 
But the ballet is also remarkable for its perennial appeal and for its 
historical significance as Romanticism's grand finale and classical ballet's 
prologue."
Copp,lia first entered Houston Ballet' repertoire in October 1974, in a 
staging by Frederic Franklin (who also performed the role of Dr. Copp,lius), 
and featuring scenery by Peter Farmer. In November 1979, former Royal Ballet 
ballerina Anne Heaton re-staged the work for the company. When Houston Ballet 
premiered its new production of the work in March 1992 featuring breathtaking 
d,cor by Desmond Heeley, Carl Cunningham of The Houston Post wrote, "It would 
be hard to imagine anything to cap the joyous, gentle, and glorious looking 
new production of Copp,lia the splendidly prepared company of dancers and 
musicians put forth Thursday evening on Wortham Center's Brown Theater 
stage."    (The Houston Post, March 21, 1992)
Heeley's designs for Copp,lia never fail to enchant, most notably in the 
second-act depiction of Dr. Copp,lius's workshop. The sampling of dolls on 
display pay homage to the era when automatons, or mechanical toys, were the 
rage in Europe -- and to Heeley's inexhaustible creativity. Among the 
eye-popping toys featured in  the workshop are a huge astrologer with a 
pointed hat and a robe covered in shooting stars and moons; a strongman with 
a handlebar mustache and barbells; Puss n Boots; an acrobat hanging from a 
trapeze holding the man in the moon; and a small ballerina dancing on the 
back of a goat. In the first act, the vibrant reds, golds, and oranges of the 
costumes worn by the peasants in the village conjure up a wonderfully 
picturesque vision of nineteenth century Bavaria.

Hello Everyone

I have another poll for you. This week's question is....

What do you think will be the most highly viewed Season
Finale?

1) Friends

2) Sopranos

3) Buffy the Vampire Slayer

4) Boston Public

5) NYPD Blue

6) ER

7) Dawson's Creek

8) None of the above

In last week's poll, the difference between spending $20
million to ride on the space shuttle or not to ride was
literally one vote. A total of 187 of those that voted said
NO while 186 said YES.

Thanks to everyone for participating in my poll and don't
forget--today begins a new Mind Scrambler!

Keep those brain waves churning!

Janie

********************* Readers Comments *********************

janie,

you are so nice to your readers and seem to be very curtious..
and you also have respect for your readers....so i was just
wondering how the heck you get along with the rude members
of your staff..like..tz,chadwick,& lewis..?

thank you,ur friend,
julie
[It's a rough job but someone has to do it. It doesn't hurt
to wear boots with thick heels to stomp on their foot if
they get out of line. ;)]

                            ****

I finally figured one out!!!  All on my own, before looking
at the answer!!  Aren't you proud?!? I AM!

10    4    13     7
 3     5    12    14
15    9     8      2
 6    16    1     11

Come to find out, it's different from the given answer.
Even Better!!

Keep 'em coming.....
Rachel
[Very good Rachel. Good luck on the future teases.]

                           ****

Please, please, please, publish my comments, I know you
have "millions" of e-mails from subscribers but some readers
need to be made aware of their mistakes, that is why my
original suggestion of a discussion board fot the daily
tease is a super idea.

Guy said he had discovered 190 more correct answers however
he neglected to read the correct answer and logic, the "Sun"
had to be in the middle of the word i.e. 4 letters in front,
4 letters after, 3 letters in front 3 letters after etc...
none of the words he gave qualified...

Darlene was talking about misspellings from Americans
(which would be the result of general transportation of
the language over a few hundred years).  However Neighbor
to NeighboUr =FINE and color to coloUr =FINE, but tomato to
tomatoE =WRONG and the same for potato, I don't know where
she is from but I am from Ireland and I spell tomato and
potato the same as you guys...Darlens should probably of
leart from Dan Quale's error...;-)

Oh, just with regards to the talking clock, I am pretty
sure there is 24 hours in the day not 12.  Well I think
that is all off my chest for the momment, I can breath
easier now..;-)

Take care, keep up the good work, Janie, your a star....

Derek
[Thanks for writing in Derek. I am glad you could get all
of that off your chest. I will pass on your suggestion for
a discussion board to the head honchos. :)]

[And thank you all for writing in. I hope to hear more from
all of you in the future! :)]

Please review the transport for next month and make certain that it is set up 
correctly for market prices.  Perm to Socal based on current spreads, SJ to 
Waha on EPNG, SJ to Waha on TW, etc.  The SJ to Waha spread is .20 for next 
month, does the transport work at these spreads?  

Please make the changes before prebid.

Also, please put in a good burn estimate for Citizens next month.  Please 
prepare to supply our socal pool with non-topock gas 100% next month.  

Thanks,
Mike

Hello Everyone

I hope everyone had a great weekend. Mine was pretty nice.
Saturday night was our banquet for our bowling league.
Various monetary prizes for different achievements were
awarded. I was very shocked that I received an award, be-
cause I had what they call a "sweeper", which means that I
scored the highest over my handicap on both lanes on a
specific night. My prize wasn't a lot of money, but it was
still pretty awesome that I actually won something. As a
whole, our team placed 8th out of 15, which was an achieve-
ment because at one time we were in last place. After the
prizes were distributed, we did a cosmic bowl, which means
that all the lights are turned off and different fluorescent
lights are turned on to light up the lanes. Then we had to
do all sorts of crazy things like bowling between your part-
ner's legs and skipping down the lane and throwing with the
opposite hand. Each time one person had to throw, and if
there were any pins left up, the partner had to pick up the
spare. It was a lot of fun. I can't wait til next year! :)

Keep those brain waves churning!

Janie

At least one answer to today's tease:

Great ease and little crosses before you are 21, great crosses
and little ease after.


********************* Readers Comments *********************

Actually the bunny will *never* poke his/her head out of each
hole at the same time. Not only because rabbits generally
only have 1 head, but because the fractions are 'tending
towards infinity'. There will never be two fractions the same,
and they will never reach 2. first it takes 1 minute, then
1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, 1/64, 1/128, etc...if you add all
them up you'll get something like 1.992, and if you keep going
it'll only become something like 1.9999992 !
Jon

                            ****

In your answer to the daily tease about the rabbit in the box,
you said it would take two minutes for the rabbit to stick it's
head out of both ends of the box.  Actually, in theory, the
rabbit would never stick it's head out of both ends of the box,
even without taking into account the fact the rabbit only has
one head.  If you kept splitting the time in half, you would
still end up with an amount of time in beween each event of
the rabbit sticking it's head out of the box.  so even if it
were one billionth of a second, if you were to cut that in
half, it would be one two billionth of a second (then one,
four billionth of a second, then one, eight billionth of a
second...and so on.).  So what i'm saying is you can't cut
any amount of time in half, and get zero.

Nick

                            ****

I don't understand your answer of two minutes.  Where do you
draw the line? 1/8 minute?  1/16th minute?  1/64th minute?
1/128th minute?  As i see it there isn't even a theoretical
answer to this one.

Reverend Swede
[Actually, I didn't think there was a possible answer for this
puzzle and it was just meant to be a joke. Sorry for the confusion.]

                            ****

For that kind of money I'd want something different, a new planet!

Sincerely yours
Rene
[Amen sister! ;)]

[Thank you all for writing in. I hope to hear more from
all of you in the future! :)]

Hello JJ.  The Clark family will have me traveling to Abilene on this day.  I 
hate to miss the highlight of the X-MAS holiday.  Let me know what the plans 
are for New Year's Eve this year.  Will you guys be in Houston?  I hope 
Dallas is treating you well.  We can't wait to see Michael.  Clark and Jake 
are doing great.

I received a notice to provide feedback on Jose Marquez.  My review is brief, 
but very favorable.  The west desk is very pleased with Jose's contribution.  
He has gone out of his way to assist each of us.    Jose communicates the 
weather and its impact very clearly.  Let me know if you need additional 
information.

Sincerely,

Mike Grigsby

Let's begin rolling out the cash products at 7:15 am.  We should also get 
back to the cash strategy of the desk each morning.  Let's start testing the 
market, find the support and resistance each day.  It would be nice to have 
EOL change the stack manager so that we can switch a product from manage 
market depth to last trade is mid with the click of a button, and not go 
through the product properties.  I'll call them tomorrow.

Let's also decide on a time to close the products each morning.  We want to 
send the message of reliability, but also allow our Ops group to balance and 
nom.  I want to begin trading the next day cash by 11:01 am every day.  This 
would stay active until 4:00.

The push is for PHYSICAL.  Our edge over the market will be phys.  From risk 
to the ability to nominate and invoice, the other platforms will never see it 
coming. What are the chances that ICE and espeed will deal with el paso 
flows?  If information is the reason for EOL, then this will provide it.  It 
all seems so simple - Fixed priced physical, just when you thought it was old 
economy.  The reliable indices to big position trading to EOL market share, 
all benefit under the new mantra.

? The extraordinary session is expected to close early next week, after the 
governor has signed SB 28X, a power plant siting bill.  Yesterday, the 
governor signed bond financing bill SB 31X.  Once the extraordinary session 
is closed, a new extraordinary session is expected to be opened immediately.  
However, sources report that no one is certain if the bills from this session 
will have the same numbers in the next session.  The legislature reportedly 
is trying to arrange so that the bills will not have to be heard again in 
committee.

? The MOU still does not have a sponsor.  Governor Davis hopes to reach a 
deal with Sempra for the state to purchase San Diego Gas and Electric's 
transmission assets.  He reportedly feels that by having deals in place with 
SoCal and SDG&E, enough momentum might be added to push the MOU through the 
legislature.  He then could go to the bankruptcy court and propose adding 
PG&E's assets, since he would have two of the three pieces in place.  The 
validity of this logic seems questionable at best.  Sources are skeptical 
that adding SDG&E to the MOU would increase the chances of the deal going 
through the legislature.  Also, the governor has claimed to be close to 
having a deal with SDG&E for several weeks, but such a deal has not yet been 
finalized.  The governor stated that he will have a sponsor for the MOU by 
next week when the bill will be introduced.  The MOU might be introduced in 
the legislature, then amended to indicate a lesser amount for the 
transmission asset purchase.  This still would not assure passage since so 
many legislators reportedly are against the MOU.

? The windfall profits tax bill has not been set for hearing on the Assemble 
floor.  

? State Legislature, Elizabeth Hill, published a report earlier this week 
regarding an analysis of state revenues.  The report stated that revenues for 
this year would be $3.4B less that was expected in January 2001, not 
including electricity costs.  She predicts that ongoing state programs will 
have to be cut by approximately $1.7B.

? Moody's has put California's credit rating under review for another 
downgrade.  Sources report that Moody's, S&P, and MBIA have all informed 
California that "the only way the state will improve its credit rating and 
look better to investors is to get out of the power business and resolve the 
undercollected."

Dear Jeff,

I am interested in summarizing all of our contracts in the western region and 
identifying any problems (i.e. penalty language, notification deadlines for 
OFOs, etc.) that may need to be addressed.  We have experienced a few 
problems with SW Gas Corp. recently.  They have been penalizing Enron for 
cuts on EPNG, but when we pursued penalties with them on a baseload one month 
deal last month, they claimed that all one month deals have been booked on an 
interruptible contract and cannot be penalized.  This was news to me.  Can 
you help me identify what types of contracts we are using to transact 
business with our customers in the west?

I can honestly say that these contracts have not been reviewed by the west 
desk for some time.  Phillip Allen transferred the desk to me  in August of 
2000 and I have not spent the time to review all of contracts.  Let's get 
together and discuss exactly what I may need.

Sincerely,
Mike Grigsby

ENERGY COMMISSION SCHEDULES HEARING, TOUR OF PROPOSED POWER PLANT SITE IN 
CHINO

Sacramento -- The California Energy Commission has scheduled a hearing and 
site tour for members of the public and other parties interested in learning 
about a 180-megawatt summer reliability generation facility proposed for 
construction this summer on the grounds of the California Institution for Men 
in Chino.

The Pegasus Project in San Bernardino County is being proposed by Pegasus 
Power Partners, LLC, part of Delta Power Company LLC. The simple cycle 
peaking facility would consist of four 45-megawatt natural gas-fired turbines 
equipped with state-of-the-art air pollution control features. Three of the 
four units would be producing power by September 30, 2001, with the fourth 
unit coming on-line by March 31, 2002. All four units are being considered 
under the Energy Commission's emergency process, which should take 
approximately 21 days to complete.

www.energy.ca.gov/sitingcases/peakers/chino/documents

A site tour and informational hearing was held on the project on Wednesday, 
May 16, 2001.

Site Visit
Assemble at 5:30 p.m.
Chino City Hall
13220 Central Avenue
Chino, California
Sacramento, CA
(Bus transportation will be provided to proposed site.)

Informational Hearing
Beginning at approximately 6:30 p.m., following the site visit.
Chino City Hall
13220 Central Avenue
Chino, California
Sacramento, CA
(Wheelchair Accessible)

Landowners, members of the general public and interested agencies are 
encouraged to participate in the site visit and the informational hearing on 
the licensing of the proposed Pegasus project.

Since this site visit will be conducted inside the California Institute for 
Men, waivers and special restrictions on dress may be required of those 
taking the tour. Please consult the Energy Commission's Public Advisor, 
Roberta Mendonca, no later than May 14, 2001, for details before signing up. 
Her office can be contacted by e-mail at . Her office can also assist 
interested individuals and organizations and provide information on 
participating in the Commission's emergency siting process. For information 
about proposed projects in Southern California, call (800) 273-4459.

Typically, peakers are simple-cycle power plants that can be constructed in a 
relatively small area and can be readily connected to existing transmission 
and natural-gas systems. For the Pegasus Project, these systems already exist 
nearby because of a 27-megawatt cogeneration power plant that operates at the 
California Institution for Men.

The Pegasus Project applied to the Energy Commission's emergency siting 
process to meet this summer'selectricity needs. The goal of the emergency 
process is to license power plants that can be on-line by September 30, 2001, 
without sacrificing the public's health or safety or California's environment.

The Commission's Public Adviser, Roberta Mendonca, can assist interested 
individuals and organizations and provide information on participating in the 
Commission's emergency siting process. Persons may contact Ms. Mendonca by 
e-mail at . For information regarding proposed projects in Northern 
California, call (877) 602-4747. For information about projects proposed in 
Southern California, call (800) 273-4459.

Information about the proposed project is available on the Energy 
Commission's Web Site at:

Hello Everyone

Congratulations to "LESLIE SMITH" who won this week's "Mind
Scrambler". If you're the winner please email me your com-
plete name and address for your prize. Here was the question:

          To some I can hold treasure,
          To others most displeasure.
          I am always near you,
          Yet always far.
          I am done when I begin,
          And begin when I end.

                   What am I?

The answer is: THE FUTURE. Some of the answers I received
were: YOUR IMAGINATION, MEMORIES, A WEDDING RING and YOUR
HEART. Also, for those of you that missed it, the answer
to last week's puzzle was: GREED.

As always, if you're not a winner this week, stay tuned...
on Monday you will have another chance at "Janie's Mind
Scrambler". Have a good weekend everyone!

Keep those brain waves churning!

Janie

TODAY'S TEASE (#742) [Giant Book of Mensa Mind Challenges
by Jaime and Lea Poniachik, Tim Sole, Rod Marshall and
J.J. Mendoza Fernandez]

On the 29th of last month, there was a double murder on the
express train from Paris to Berlin. The engineer and the
conductor were killed at the same time, even though they
were at opposite ends of the train. This was confirmed by
a police detective, who was the exact center of the train
and heard both gunshots at the same time.

When my cousin was told the story, he realized that both
victims did not die at the same time.

How did he figure it out?

We've got it and it's specially priced at three hilarious
videos for only $29.98. If you've never seen these movies you
are in for a real treat, if you have, you now have the
opportunity to own them at this special price. What's the best
way to describe these movies? Take one part Magnificent Seven,
one part High Plains Drifter and add a heavy dash of Blazing
Saddles. For more information or to order visit:

At least one answer to today's tease:

If the police detective heard the shots at the same time, it
means that the men could not have died at the same time. If
both sounds had occurred at the same time at opposite ends of
the train, he would have first heard the one from the front
car, because the speed of the train was added to the speed
of sound. For the sound from the back of the train, the speed
of the train was subtracted from the speed of sound. For the
detective to hear both shots at once means the man at the back
of the train was killed first.


********************* Readers Comments *********************

Hi Janie,  I think that Darlene was talking about a completely
different word. Darlene was thinking of the word Suede (swayed).
You wrote the word Swede (sweed).  The word was spelled corr-
ectly in your puzzle.  Darlene simply mis-identified it.
Dianne

                            ****

Hi Janie,

Just one comment about "Guy's" response to your "days of the
week" tease. He gave you several answers which *contained*
the letters SUN.  However, *none* of them had SUN in the exact
middle of the word (as the answer had to be).  You need to
have the same number of letters before and after the SUN to
be a correct answer.  Nice try, Guy.

I really enjoy your daily teases.........they do keep my
brain waves churning......something which my job has failed
to do for me lately!

Paula

all of you in the future! :)]

You all have done an excellent job with the gas daily products.  I have been 
asked to follow up with you guys to ensure that the products are rolled out 
on EOL at the same time each day and that they be managed in the same manner 
that you manage your cash products each day.  We have been asked to have one 
a day up at all times with a relatively tight two way and to provide market 
depth.  You may provide market depth, offset to last trade, or use last trade 
mid functions.  Let me know if you have any questions or concerns regarding 
this request.

Thanks,
Mike

I made some big changes to the index curves tonight.  Please run a new P&L 
early in the morning in order to estimate what the changes in book value will 
be.  I will need to let John Lavorado know about the changes to the curves 
before we decide to book these tomorrow.   Please run a report from the 
transport model so that I may see the changes to the delivery points.

Thanks,
Mike

Bruce, 

I work with Phillip Allen in West Gas Trading and he talked to Greg Piper 
about the letter attached below, and Greg told us to forward it to you.    
Mr. Chase Belew and Mr. Carleson, with E*Steel, would like to meet with you 
to discuss market opportunities in the global steel market.   I would like to 
have Mr. Belew call you to set up a time to meet with you.  Would this be a 
problem?  Please call me to discuss.

Sincerely,

Subject: Meeting with Enron Networks



Mike,

As per our conversation, I would appreciate your help to arrange a short
meeting with executives from Enron Networks and a group from our company.

e-STEEL (www.e-steel.com) has become the preferred marketplace as well as
the recognized technological and collaborative commerce leader for the
$800billion global steel market. We have financial backing from Goldman
Sachs and Kleiner Perkins and have alliance contracts with companies
throughout the steel supply chain, including U.S. Steel and Ford Motor
Company . Because we consider Enron another leader in the development of
electronic marketplaces, we feel that there may be areas for mutual
cooperation. The purpose of our meeting is strictly exploratory.

Our group will consist of myself and Mr. Russ Carleson (Vice President,
Sales) from our headquarters in New York. We would like to propose a lunch
meeting next Thursday, September 14th, if possible. I will call you this
week to follow up.

Thanks,


Chase Belew

Sorry I didn't get back to you sooner.  Thank you for the invite the other 
day.  I just had my second child, so I am little busy.  We will be turning on 
the box with natsource gas daily today.  I apologize for the inconvenience.  
The information reported internally warranted suspending business with 
Natsource for a few days.  I am not interested in hearing your side of the 
story.  Business as usual here forward.

Executive Summary

? The likely outcome of the 16 May elections is a victory by the BC Liberal=
=20
Party (currently holding polls at 70%), a pro-business, right-of-center par=
ty=20
led by Gordon Campbell. =20
? Major changes in British Columbia energy policy are likely under a Libera=
l=20
government.
? A low snow pack, a return to regulation by the BC Utilities Commission an=
d=20
public concern about outstanding debts owed by US power consumers could for=
ce=20
BC Hydro to stop out-of-province power sales once existing contracts expire
? BC Hydro=01,s additional generation at Williston is likely undeliverable

Liberal Party Platform

? Income tax cut that would make BC=01,s income tax the lowest in Canada
? Independent audit of the province=01,s books amid allegations of NDP=20
mismanagement and incompetence
? Review of all Crown corporations (including BC Hydro) to enhance efficien=
cy=20
and management quality
? Campbell has also said that he wants to scrap the Corporate Capital Tax,=
=20
the Machinery Equipment Tax and the Corporate Income Tax.

Energy Agenda

According to sources, under the Liberal party's rule, significant changes i=
n=20
the BC government's energy policy could include a move toward the=20
privatization of some BC Hydro assets, perhaps including its transmission=
=20
assets, as well as increased government support for independent power=20
producers and coal-fired production.  At the same time, a rate review and=
=20
attempts to establish a broad electricity strategy for the province could=
=20
lead to a lack of clarity about the province=01,s overall energy strategy o=
ver=20
the next few years.  Campbell reportedly is a proponent of deregulation and=
=20
of expanding coal-fired production.  Campbell calls thermal coal, =01&an as=
set=20
that we want to be able to move forward with and to encourage once again in=
=20
BC.=018  A high-ranking NDP source believes that Campbell will take the pro=
vince=20
back along the path of natural resources extraction rather than promoting n=
ew=20
technology.  The source expects this to lead to strong protests from=20
environmentalists.  =01&These are confrontational moves, and people will be=
 on=20
the streets.=018=20

Campbell's most likely choice for energy minister is Richard Neufeldt, thou=
gh=20
we caution that this decision depends on the make-up of the legislature aft=
er=20
the election.  Neufeldt is responsible for the Liberal Party=01,s energy, m=
ining=20
and northern development portfolio.  Sources speculate that if right-wing=
=20
Liberals are dissatisfied with the party=01,s performance after the May=20
election, Neufeldt could again defect to the Opposition.  However, this giv=
es=20
Campbell even greater incentive to name Neufeldt energy minister, a=20
high-profile position.

Should the Liberals win the election, Gordon Campbell has indicated that he=
=20
would return BC Hydro to regulation by the BC Utilities Commission.  The BC=
=20
government has derived $5.5 billion in revenue from BC Hydro since 1991=20
(roughly 85 percent of its profit).  Critics say this has undermined the=20
utility=01,s ability to pay down approximately $7.5 billion in debt and inv=
est=20
in the future. This also has left Hydro without a rate stabilization fund,=
=20
something that sources feel may be needed this year.  Campbell reportedly=
=20
intends to address these issues, and one can expect this to lead to calls f=
or=20
change.
=20
Electricity Export Policy

Currently the BC Utilities Commission is demanding more information about B=
C=20
Hydro=01,s out-of-province sales.  The Commission has warned that, given th=
e low=20
snow pack, the utility could be a net importer of power this year. Supporti=
ng=20
this view, the Northwest Power Planning Council, representing BC Hydro=01,s=
 key=20
trading partners in the US, has said that it would not be able to rely upon=
=20
British Columbia or Alberta during peak consumption periods over the next f=
ew=20
years, and that its customers face a 25 percent chance of not making it=20
through the winter without power losses.  The combination of a low snow pac=
k,=20
a return to regulation by the BC Utilities Commission and public concern=20
about outstanding debts owed to BC Hydro by US consumers may force BC Hydro=
=20
to stop out-of-province power sales once existing contracts expire.

BC Hydro Privatization

A key campaign energy issue for the Liberal party is the privatization of B=
C=20
Hydro.  Campbell has urged greater electricity competition, saying, =01&We =
need=20
to ensure the transmission infrastructure is available to all, producers an=
d=20
consumers, on an equal and non-discriminatory basis.=018 He stated that=20
independent power producers have been discouraged at every turn. =01&I want=
 to=20
change that big time,=018 he told the Canadian Institute of Energy.  Campbe=
ll=20
also urged more natural gas development, including pipelines and=20
co-generation plants.

Campbell backtracked on this stance last week after being challenged by NDP=
=20
leader Ujjal Dosanjh.  Campbell stated on 25 April, =01&We have no intentio=
n of=20
selling BC Hydro; we have no intentions of selling their transmission lines=
,=20
no intention of selling their dams, we have no intention of selling their=
=20
reservoirs.=018  Liberal Party spokesman Mike Morton also reiterated on 29 =
April=20
that BC Hydro would not be for sale.  A high-level NDP source commented tha=
t=20
Campbell has been extremely careful in his choice of words regarding BC=20
Hydro, essentially saying that he would not privatize the dams, transmissio=
n=20
lines or generating stations, but that he is in favor of opening the sector=
=20
up to competition.

However, local sources believe that some parts of BC Hydro might be sold as=
=20
part of an overall review of BC Crown Corporations to enhance efficiency. =
=20
Likely sale prospects include BC Hydro=01,s distribution channels and its e=
nergy=20
trading subsidiary, Powerex.  In addition, Gary Farrell-Collins, the Libera=
l=20
finance spokesperson and possible second choice for energy minister (after=
=20
Neufeldt), has stated that public ownership of BC Hydro=01,s non-core=20
businesses, such as Westech, its systems division, and customer billing,=20
could come under review.

BC Hydro Williston Generation

Current reservoirs levels at BC Hydro=01,s Williston hydro-generation facil=
ity=20
are at 2,150ft, which allows BC Hydro to drop levels another 35 ft (170=20
Gwhs/ft) under their current permit.  The one drawback to this plan=01,s=20
additional generation involves the Mackenzie pulp mill that would have to=
=20
cease operation if water levels were to fall below 2,140ft.  Sources close =
to=20
the Minister of Mines & Energy - elect, Richard Neufeldt, indicate that=20
levels at Williston probably will not be drawn down below Mackenzie=01,s=20
operational limits due to concern over political backlash.=20

Dale,  

Will you please create the following products for me when you get the 
chance?  I would like to have GD/D HHUB vs EP San Juan,  GD/D HHUB vs. EP 
Permian, GD/D HHUB vs. Malin, and  GD/D HHUB vs. Kern/Opal.  These will look 
like the GD/D HHUB vs. SCal that we currently have in EOL.

Also, Can I please create three Gas Daily basis products. GD/D BAJA spread - 
This spread will simply be the GD/D SCAL vs. PG&E Citygate. 
The GD/D Redwood off-system spread - GD/D Malin vs. SCal.  The GD/D Redwood 
on-system spread -   GD/D Malin vs. PG&E Citygate.

Call me to discuss.  Thank you.

Mike Grigsby

Your Date of Migration is: May 14th

YOU WILL BE UNABLE TO SEND E-MAIL unless you take the following action:
Please go through your Notes email and clean out as many old/un-needed emai=
l=20
items as possible BEFORE your date of migration.? After you are migrated to=
=20
Outlook you will only be allocated 100MB of total Mailbox space.?? If more=
=20
than this amount of data is migrated to Outlook YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEN=
D=20
E-MAIL until it is below the 100MB limit.? Cleaning up your Notes email now=
=20
will prevent this from happening to YOU.

Enron=01,s messaging platform is migrating from Lotus Notes to Microsoft Ou=
tlook=20
2000 worldwide.  You will be accessing Outlook for all of your email=20
functions.=20

WHY IS ENRON MIGRATING TO OUTLOOK 2000?

Many factors contributed to the decision to migrate from Lotus Notes to=20
Microsoft Exchange/Outlook.  The most prominent factors were:

? Significant advantages to moving to a product that is more integrated wit=
h=20
current Enron apps (Windows 2000, Office and Internet Explorer)
? More efficient Shared PC and Roaming User features
? Improved support and integration for Palm/CE devices
? Instant Messaging capabilities

WHAT IS BEING MIGRATED TO OUTLOOK 2000?

? Email Messages.  From the date of your scheduled migration, the last (30)=
=20
thirty days of your Email will be converted for use in Outlook.
? All your folders in Notes you use to store email messages in.
? To Do Items
? Journal Items
? Calendar Entries dating from (1) one year in the past to (10) ten years i=
n=20
the future will be converted.
? Address Books, but NOT your Distribution Lists that you created.  You wil=
l=20
need to re-create these in Outlook.

Thank you,

We need to make certain that the transport  for Pasdena is booked properly in 
sitara.  I am taking a flash to actual hit on P&L because of our inability to 
book this deal properly.  I need the transport booked in sitara at index to 
index, and then book the fixed cost payed to Pasadena in an index minus sale 
to them at the border.  Please run a minibook of the transaction thru the 
remaining term and let me review it.  Please let me know when this has been 
fixed.  

Kim, what is the cost of the transport for the month of May?  Did we roll the 
cost from April?  Also, did we change the index in the San Juan to Inside 
Ferc?


Thanks, 

Mike

Let's begin rolling out the cash products at 7:15 am.  We should also get 
back to the cash strategy of the desk each morning.  Let's start testing the 
market, find the support and resistance each day.  It would be nice to have 
EOL change the stack manager so that we can switch a product from manage 
market depth to last trade is mid with the click of a button, and not go 
through the product properties.  I'll call them tomorrow.

Let's also decide on a time to close the products each morning.  We want to 
send the message of reliability, but also allow our Ops group to balance and 
nom.  I want to begin trading the next day cash by 11:01 am every day.  This 
would stay active until 4:00.

The push is for PHYSICAL.  Our edge over the market will be phys.  From risk 
to the ability to nominate and invoice, the other platforms will never see it 
coming. What are the chances that ICE and espeed will deal with el paso 
flows?  If information is the reason for EOL, then this will provide it.  It 
all seems so simple - Fixed priced physical, just when you thought it was old 
economy.  The reliable indices to big position trading to EOL market share, 
all benefit under the new mantra.

Mike

		Dear Mike,
		
		California may see rolling blackouts again today, and ENL's Washington Bureau 
Chief Jay Cranford may get to experience them firsthand.  Jay is in 
Sacramento covering the meeting between Gov. Gray Davis and the CEOs of 
several power providers.  This afternoon, Jay brought us an interview with 
Gov. Davis' Press Secretary Steve Maviglio.  For those of you who missed the 
4:00 p.m. EST broadcast, you can log onto ENL and find the full Maviglio 
interview in the "Video Library."  
		
		While Jay is still in Sacramento, ENL's Burke Moeller and Peter Cook are 
holding down the fort in Washington, D.C.  Burke says the D.C. bureau is 
waiting for the changes in Chairman Joe Barton's Electricity Emergency Relief 
Act.  The bill calls for some measures in short-term relief, but doesn't 
mention price caps on wholesale power.  The markup is scheduled for 
tomorrow.  The Washington bureau is also keeping tabs on Secretary of Energy 
Spencer Abraham as he testifies before the Senate Energy and Natural 
Resources Committee.  These are just a few developing stories that the D.C. 
bureau will be following tomorrow.       
		
		We'll head south from D.C. to Houston where correspondent Kim Benestante 
tomorrow is scheduled to speak with University of Houston professor Dr. 
Barton Smith.  Dr. Smith will talk about cleaner-burning fuels and air 
quality, and how Houston's energy economy is following national trends. 
Another big story from Houston involves a breach of contract lawsuit against 
IP Petroleum for failing to drill a well to a sufficient depth.  ENL talks 
with attorneys about the case tomorrow.  Be sure to catch these and other 
stories tomorrow from the Houston bureau. 
		
		Houston's Gale Smith is heading for colder climates.  We're sending her to 
Alaska for part of next week.  I'll bring you more details as they become 
available.   
		
		Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally 
guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep 
you updated on future interviews and events.

Current Notes User:

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook 
client will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail 
via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is 
configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is 
migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your 
web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and 
To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook 
client is configured on your desktop.

2. Remote access to your mailbox.
After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) 
for remote access to your mailbox.

PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while 
connecting to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA 
available from your home or when traveling abroad.

HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  
http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe

Substitute "john.doe" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You 
will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in "corp/your user 
id" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You 
will now be able to view your mailbox.

 

PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between 
the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things 
in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the 
functions NOT available via OWA:

Features NOT available using OWA:

-  Tasks
-  Journal
-  Spell Checker
-  Offline Use
-  Printing Templates
-  Reminders
-  Timed Delivery
-  Expiration
-  Outlook Rules
-  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall
-  Sharing Contacts with others
-  Task Delegation
-  Direct Resource Booking
-  Personal Distribution Lists

QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?

If you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the 
Outlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at:

 Outlook.2000@enron.com

Otherwise, you may contact the Resolution Center at:

 713-853-1411

Thank you,

Will you please set up two new indices in the database.  The first one will 
be NGI Southern Border, Socal.  This is different for the current NGI Socal 
border index in the system.  Also, please set up NGI Southern Border, PG&E.  
Let me know when they have been added.  These indices will begin posting in 
NGI for April, 2001.

Thank you,

		Dear Mike,
		
		Today in Washington, D.C., the House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee 
voted against a proposal to force the FERC to impose price caps in the West.  
D.C. bureau correspondent Peter Cook says tomorrow the bureau is following up 
on the fallout from today's failed effort by Democrats to force the price 
caps issue.  Peter also says tomorrow they'll bring us the latest leaks from 
next week's scheduled White House Energy Task Force recommendations.    
		
		From the Houston bureau tomorrow, ENL's Gale Smith says AES New Energy's 
Corby Whitaker is scheduled to be in studio.  He'll update us on how AES is 
doing so far in the Texas electricity deregulation pilot program.  Gale says 
Whitaker will also give us details as to how many retail businesses have 
signed up, and what the future holds for AES New Energy.  Houston 
correspondent Kim Benestante is scheduled to give us an update on crude 
storage in the Gulf of Mexico.  Kim says the U.S. Coast Guard and the Federal 
Minerals Management Services are close to approving rules allowing ships to 
store crude while anchored in the Gulf.  We'll bring you all the details on 
these and other stories from Houston tomorrow.        
		
		As promised, I have information on ENL's trip to Alaska.  The Houston 
bureau's Gale Smith is frantically digging out warmer clothes as she prepares 
to go to Anchorage Monday and Tuesday to cover the Interstate Oil and Gas 
Compact Commission's Midyear Meeting.  The IOGCC represents 37 governors from 
states that produce most of the domestic oil and natural gas in the U.S.  
Gale says the agenda for the Midyear Meeting includes oil and gas production 
in Alaska, the National Energy Policy, petroleum production and environmental 
issues.  Some guest speakers include Alaska Governor and IOGCC Chairman Tony 
Knowles, former U.S. Senator Slade Gorton, and Alaska Oil & Gas Conservation 
Commission representatives from Phillips Alaska, OMEGA Oil Company, and BP 
Amoco. 
		
		Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally 
guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep 
you updated on future interviews and events.

I have been thinking about the cash book idea for group and I think we need 
to discuss this in more detail.  I would like to continue to use the physical 
for large prompt positions going forward.  I am afraid that the baseload 
volumes may not continue on their current trend if we break out the books.  
We need to discuss how the cash books would lay off risk.  i.e. Intra 
regional spreads with GD swap legs or spreads with other cash points and then 
booking out at gd mid to the internal counterparty.  Janie managing SJ and 
laying off risk on Steve's Opal.  I know that the cash books would be a good 
idea for dailies , but I am not sure how to do this without giving up the 
cash risk for baseload as well.  What are your thoughts?

I would also like to discuss the staffing issues.  Matt Smith and Susan Scott 
to analyst,  Jay to the ROX, etc.  It seems like Ken S. has shown more 
interest in the west fundies lately.  Should we keep his services?

The basis products need another book.  Who can we add to the mix?  I think 
that we should look into having Frank focus on prompt month only.  He has a 
great interest in cash and fundies and this should serve him well in managing 
tight two ways for all products on the prompt.  Keith can do term with 
another book.

Monique is going to take over the gd swaps for Kern, SJ, and Perm.  I will 
continue to manage the CA products.  This should allow us to provide tighter 
two ways across the west. I will continue to manage all index products and 
prompt month phys fixed price.

Operations needs more labor as well as an analyst or two to monitor flows.  
The analysts will monitor flows by price and hopefully find creative ways to 
nom the market.

EOL.  Keith has a great idea of opening up all products to the desk so that 
you may insert a bid or an offer inside of the manager's markets.  We should 
propose this to EOL.  This would allow for tighter markets on all products 
and prevent the desk from working markets through the brokers.

Ca cash products.  Let's call a meeting about how to offer more Socal 
physical products.  I would like to have PG&E topock and Socal Ehrenberg 
before the summer.  


Mike

Please note that new factors will be put into production this evening.  
Value-at-risk will most likely increase by the percentage outlined below.  
Shorts are driving price risk, while long basis drives the forward physical 
risk.   




Let me know if you need access to component VAR analysis, so that you can 
effectively manage VAR.

Okay, I think the tds tab in newcurrentday was wrong.  It is showing a jan 
pos of 269.55 lots, but TDS is showing 539.1.  False alarm.  We will fix 
newcurrentday.

Subject: PG&E Citygate Basis position for January

The PG&E basis position in TDS does not match the FEB/MAR position.  The Baja 
spread was executed as a NOV-MAR position months ago. The only real changes 
were to Socal basis over time. There is no telling when this might have 
changed in error.  Will you please research the position to see when this 
position was reduced.  I am guessing that a park and loan was executed by 
Frank Ermis at some point and the basis risk was allocated to GD New by 
mistake.  

Thanks,
Mike

Greg,

Are you interested in discussing opportunities with E*steel at another 
time?   I would like to have Mr. Belew call you to set up an appointment in 
the near future.  Let me know what your objective is with Enron Networks, and 
if you are pursuing the same online platform growth in steel that we are in 
natural gas.  Do you see opportunities in trading steel products as a 
commodity at some point, and if so, will Enron be active in making markets 
not only on EOL, but on other platforms?  

I appreciate your taking the time to entertain their questions.  Thank you 
for your assistance.

sincerely,
Mike Grigsby
Director, West Gas Trading

Can we create a San Juan phys for Oct bidweek?  What did we decide with this 
product - swing only?  If we do, I would like to link it to the basis plus 
nymex, or to the fixed price gas daily (fixed price gas daily will be rolled 
out during bidweek this month because of our risk in gd basis going 
forward).  I want to roll the Inside Ferc phys points out during bidweek 7-4, 
as defined by Inside Ferc, last trade is mid.  The NGI index points will be 
out 7 to 4 during bidweek, as defined by NGI.  

We will plan on sending the data to both index publications.  Time open to 
market, time of actual trade, counterparty, price, etc.  This will be 
considered their last opportunity to be accurate or we will decline to 
participate until their numbers are audited.

Thanks,
Mike

Barry,

I would like to focus our deal flow on Apr-Oct or 1 yr San Juan and Rockies 
supply.  Our fundamental investment is mainly in the rockies for 2001.  Let's 
get together with Mark Whitt, Paul Lucci, and others to set our supply goals 
for the mainly the apr-oct period.  I would like to work on buying every 
mmbtu of Opal, and all points included in the IF NW Rockies index.  Our goal 
should be to purchase at least 400,000/d of rockies supply and 500,000/d of 
San Juan Blanco and Bondad.  we have been buying these phys index points at 
+.01 in the rockies and +.005 in the San Juan.  You may need to coordinate 
with Fred Lagrosta's group initially to get all of their producer contacts.

Thanks,
Mike

? Over the weekend, Gov. Davis and Senate Polance made an informal agreement 
whereby Senate Polance has agreed to sponsor the SoCal MOU bill.  Polanco is 
a Democrat and is  currently suffering through a personal scandal and as a 
result, it is  reported that his political career is essential dead.   
Polance is planning to run for mayor of Los Angeles rather than run for 
another Senate term.  

? The bill is expected to be introduced in the new extraordinary session, 
beginning today or tomorrow.  The bill would first go to the Senate Energy 
Committee.  Sen. Bowen, the chair of the committee, strongly opposes the MOU, 
so the bill is expected to remain in committee hearings for some time.  The 
longer the bill is involved in committee politics and changes are made, the 
likelihood of a SoCal bankruptcy increases.

There is another problem on the invoice.  According to the PG&E
transportation billing Newark Sierra Paperboard used 72758 mmbtu and
California Paperboard used 14650 mmbtu.  The total mmbtu invoiced should
be 87408 mmbtu not 87800 mmbtu.  Please bill California Paperboard 14650
mmbtu instead.  Thanks!

Steve,

Start buying N-M citygate index this week.  Pay as much as necessary to get 
resonable size.  I am thinking 100,000/d for the winter.

Energy Commission Staff Completes Assessment
of Proposed Peaker Power Plant Project in Hanford


Sacramento - The staff of the California Energy Commission has
recommended approval of the proposal by GWF Power Systems Company for
a 95-megawatt peaker power plant at Hanford Energy Park in Kings
County.

The Hanford Peaker Project is a simple cycle, natural gas-fired power
plant proposed for construction and operation on a site immediately
adjacent to the existing GWF Hanford cogeneration plant, just north
of Idaho Avenue. If approved, the facility is expected to start
commercial operation August 1, 2001.

The Staff Assessment of this project can be viewed and printed from
the Energy Commission's Web Site at:

www.energy.ca.gov/sitingcases/peakers/hanford/documents

A site tour and informational hearing was held on the project on Friday,
April 20, 2001.

A Proposed Decision on the Hanford project, which will also be
available on the Energy Commission's Web Site, is being released
today.

The full five-member Energy Commission will consider the Proposed
Decision at its business meeting as follows:

THURSDAY, MAY 10, 2001
Beginning at 10 a.m.
California Energy Commission
1516 Ninth Street
Hearing Room A
Sacramento, CA
(Wheelchair Accessible)

The proposed Hanford Park Peaker Project applied to the Energy
Commission's emergency siting process to meet this summer's
electricity needs. The goal of the emergency process is to license
power plants that can be on-line by September 30, 2001, without
sacrificing the public's health or safety or California's environment.

Typically, peaker power plants are simple-cycle generators that can
be constructed in a relatively short period of time, readily
connected to the existing electricity transmission and natural gas
system, and dispatched quickly to meet peak electricity demands.

The Commission's Public Adviser, Roberta Mendonca, can assist
interested individuals and organizations and provide information on
participating in the Commission's emergency siting process. Persons
may contact Ms. Mendonca by e-mail at <pao@energy.state.ca.us>. For
information regarding proposed projects in Northern California, call
(877) 602-4747. For information about projects proposed in Southern
California, call (800) 273-4459.

Information about the proposed project is available on the Energy
Commission's Web Site at:

www.energy.ca.gov/sitingcases/peakers

QUOTE OF THE DAY
=========================

"Is the question, How fully can we engineer the human body to
do physically impossible things? If it is, what do you have
at the end of that? Something that looks like a human, but
is so engineered, so tuned, that it's no longer going to do
what the body is designed to do."

- DR. THEODORE FRIEDMANN, director of the gene therapy program at the 
University of
California at San Diego.

For the son of Hafez al-Assad to be accusing anyone of
religious intolerance is laughable.

Ever since Jane Swift ran for lieutenant governor of
Massachusetts, her life has resembled one of those old
"Airport" movies in which there's a bomb on the plane.

Let's talk to Matt about the forecast sheets for Socal and PG&E.  He needs to 
work on the TW sheet as well.   Also, I would like him to create a sheet on 
pipeline expansions and their rates and then tie in the daily curves for the 
desk to use.

Mike

Anne, can we add the new pg&e topock curve to the basis transport tab?  Also, 
the LT transport section is showing the transport positions through 2002, 
which is incorrect.  Please review the transport deals in the model and 
delete the positions.

Thanks,
Mike

Dear Tom, 

Enron would be interested in getting together with other trading partners to 
discuss listing other index points at the Socal border.  I think the market 
requires other postings to reflect the fundamental changes in the market with 
respect to transportation constraints.  The market has clearly seen a 
divergence in the summer spreads between PG&E and Socal interconnects.  The 
marginal generation load in SP-15 and Southern California this summer has 
proven that Socal Gas is short delivered gas and is incapable of meeting 
daily demand with flowing supplies, and will be incapable of injecting gas 
during these months.  Because of this, supply being transported from the 
Southwest supply basins can only find a home going into PG&E.  This places 
downward pressure on PG&E Topock gas and upward pressure on Socal Topock 
gas.  Remember, Socal is an island, not because of the delivered capacity to 
the border via EPNG and TW, but because of the limited capacity of Socal's 
interconnects.  Demand exceeds the supply interconnect capacity.   

There is also a divergence between Ehrenberg and Topock because of 
liquidity.  Topock is a more liquid market because of the upstream transport 
contracts on EPNG and downstream buying patterns of certain Socal markets. 
The market is more diversified at Topock than Ehrenberg.  The overwhelming 
demand pressure on Socal gets exposed at Topock.  Although Ehrenberg is the 
marginal point for gas into Socal, there is more of an imbalance in upstream 
capacity (EPNG and TW) to downstream capacity (Socal Topock 545,000/d) at 
Socal Topock than at Ehrenberg.  The Socal Ehrenberg interconnect has 1.1 bcf 
of capacity and is primarily sourced by one market transporter.  Ehrenberg 
simply gets placed at "market prices" because of varying objectives.  One 
transporter may place gas to larger buyers to ensure flows, while smaller 
buyers on Socal may not approach this transporter for supplies.  This 
illiquidity has led to a spread existing between Topock and Ehrenberg. 

Picture  the market, San Juan gas is trading well below the Permian and Waha 
basins, which happen to be the marginal supply points for the west.  Because 
of the of the limited capacity going into Socal Topock, every transporter on 
EPNG and TW wants to fill their contracts with San Juan gas first.  These 
molecules compete for Buyers at a limited delivery interconnect. Likewise, 
all Buyers reach out for supply coming through a limited delivery 
interconnect (Topock). The San Juan then trys to find an outlet going east on 
the SJ east leg of EPNG.  This transport leg simply displaces Permian gas 
going into Plains North and allows Permian gas to head west to Ehrenberg on 
the EPNG south mainline.  While the Socal market peaks in the summer, so does 
the EOC demand.  Permian west (Keystone West meter)  cannot satisfy both the 
EOC demand and the Socal demand.  So for the first time ever, we saw EPNG 
Waha West at maximum capacity to source transport contracts on the EPNG south 
mainline.  This tells the entire story.  When demand exceeds all available 
historical supply points, and begins to reach to Waha to meet Ehrenberg 
demand, you have a paradigm shift.   This eliminates any correlation that may 
have existed between the supply basins and the market area.  When Keystone 
West reaches maximum capacity, the rule of market spreads not exceeding the 
max rate transport rate then dies a fast death.  There is simply no available 
capacity at the Keystone West meter to allow a shipper to buy max rate 
transport on EPNG and ship it to Socal.  If you asked the market what the 
maximum interconnect capacity at Keystone West is, 9 out of 10 would not 
know.  This leads to blaming market participants for wide spreads that are 
above historical levels.  It is like Al Gore blaming "big oil companies" for 
the high prices of gas, when all refineries are at maximum capacity.  There 
simply isn't the capacity to meet demand.  The supply exists, but there isn't 
enough refining capacity available to meet demand.  Fundamentals rule the 
market in all cases.

I would like to propose the following index points for the Southern 
California border.  The market would  be better served with supply being 
included in these index points.  One, Socal CA production/Socal storage/EPNG 
Ehrenberg, Two, Topock TW and EPNG, Three, KRS/Wheeler Ridge.  The market 
will be experiencing more changes with respect to the Socal restructuring in 
the future.  We will then address the different interconnects and propose an 
index for the Socal citygate as well. 

Call me on Monday to discuss the Enron Online download.

Sincerely,   

Mike Grigsby
Director of West Trading

I will submit the move request for the west desk on Monday.  We should have 
Anne fill this spot. I would like her to keep track of New Current day and 
all new deals that flow through the desk.  She can coordinate tickets to your 
group and make sure that they get booked throughout the day.  She can also 
put physical deals in Sitara.  Let me know what the desktop PC will need to 
be loaded with.  Start thinking of other tasks that she might be able to 
accomplish so that your group may get home at an earlier time each day.  You 
can keep this desk for your own use and rotate people through as needed.

Thanks,
Mike

Can we scrub the transport model P&L for yesterday?  Did the transport being 
switched to PG&E topock show any losses?  Let me know the breakdown.

Let's continue to go long sep swing on Socal.  I am willing to as long as we 
can each day.  The plan of getting short for OCT bidweek no longer applies 
because of reduced basis risk in OCT basis.

The Rockies index language looks good.  We need to separate the southern 
border PG&E trades from the southern border socal and Socal trades.  All 
Socal trades (except KRS, which we have none at this time) go under Socal and 
southern border - socal wacogs, while the PG&E topock/southern border - PG&E 
trades go under the Southern border, PG&E wacog.  Please make the change to 
the sheet and forward a copy to me before emailing.

Thanks,
Mike

The update on this project is that it would originate a the Western end of 
the Overthrust Pipeline and continue into California.  When I asked where we 
would get the supply CIG's answer was that "we are hoping to generate 
interest from the Generation Market, they don't seem to care if there is 
supply or not they just want capacity".  For those of us who realize there is 
no supply for this pipe, CIG will be holding an open season on WIC and 
Overthrust to bring gas supplies from Cheyenne.  With the capacity on WIC an 
Overthrust you would also have a tie from Cheyenne to Kern.  I assume that 
the open season will allow you to take whatever piece you want.  There could 
be a significant opportunity here at the right rate.  We should get an entire 
packet on this next week with maps and the like and we can discuss it further 
at that time.  However, if you have questions prior to that let me know.

Mark

Will you please set up the 100% flow SJ product?  I would like the title to 
be just like the current EP product -  no mention of 100% flow on the title.  
I would like to avoid making this a separate index posting.  Let's make this 
available to the entire market.

Anne,

We need to delete the two trades listed under rockies that are priced 13.90 
and 14.00.  Please move these trades to Sumas and resend the data to the 
publications with an explanation.  The index for rox should be 5.9125 after 
you make the changes.

Thanks,
Mike

Would it be okay if we went ahead and rolled the socal and baja transport in 
sitara?  I would like to input the Socal transport through October 2001, San 
Juan to PG&E Topock and Mojave Topock (ask Janie for the allocation in 
April).  The Baja transport is through March 2002.  80000/d to Citygate and 
20,000 to KRS off-system.

This will really help me monitor my physical index exposure on the curve.  
Let's get together and discuss tomorrow.

Thanks,
Mike

Please read the following email from EOL.  I have asked them to assist the 
West desk in mailing out an ad to all of our customers (utilities, producers, 
industrials, and some IPPs) notifying them of our plan to reduce the minimum 
volume accepted on all of our EOL products.  Start thinking of which 
customers should be on the list and try to think of a creative way to present 
this to our customers.  EOL has asked us to provide them with the text of our 
message.

Also, let's go ahead and reduce the min volume on our products (primarily all 
phys and gas dailies) this week.  We are attempting to capture all of the odd 
lot flow in the market.  I would see this service as a clear advantage over 
the other web platforms.  

Let's get together on Friday afternoon at Ninfa's to discuss our ideas.

Thanks,
Mike

Will be happy to help this group.  They'll need to agree to the following:

1.  They pay for the cost (to be determined depending on the quality of the 
mailing)
2.  They provide a mailing list with following separate columns:
First name
Last Name
Company Name
Address
City
State
Zip
3.  Give us a draft of the text for the mailing
4.  Give us 5 working days to get it out.  (we will try to do it faster, but 
it depends on several factors)

We will need to discuss how to adjust physical risk to match the flow 
constraints on EPNG.  The currrent capacity cuts in the SJ and Socal topock 
delivery points are 50%.  I would like my P&L to show this risk.  Please find 
a way to adjust the positions according to a daily flow curve that can be set 
in newcurrentday by either myself or Monique.  

Also, We will need to set up a new physical curve for Mojave Topock.  Our 
transport is currently being reallocated by EPNG for deliveries to Mojave 
instead of Socal topock.  I would like to show the transport on EPNG value as 
SJ plus cost to Mojave and have the value roll out each month, if any.  The 
risk is showing the value of SJ to Socal topock (currently wide spreads for 
2001) on the transport when it actually has less value delivering to Mojave 
topock.

Sincerely,
Mike

Sources report that the bond authorization will be put to a vote today

The bridge loan financing bill will put to a vote today in the California 
Assembly.  The Republicans are currently in caucus until 3:30 PST and then 
will go to the floor for a vote.  The current situation is very fluid, but 
sources now indicate that the bill would pass with a simple majority vote, 
lacking the two-thirds needed for an immediate bond issuance.  If this is the 
case, the bill would not take effect for 90 days and the state would be 
forced to abandon its proposed bridge loan plans.  Absent of last minute 
financial rescues by Davis or a new longer bridge loan package (unlikely) 
Socal could seek voluntary bankruptcy.  The main problem would then be the 
waiting period for financial relief from the state through the transmission 
line purchase or other assistance.

There is an outside chance that Republican defectors could precipitate from 
the current caucus.  There is extreme pressure on the Republicans from Davis 
and Angelides.  If the bill failed due to lack of Republican support, it 
would provide Davis the opportunity to blame Republicans for on-going 
expenditures of $70M/day (power purchases), and a possible bankruptcy by 
Socal.  The last Republican who gave support to a democratic bill (AB 1X), 
Representative Bill Campbell, lost his job.  Sources also confirm that 
Democrats have not met with Republicans on the bond issuance since last week.

I like this report.  Can it be put into the same format as the other "access" 
reports?  Thanks for all of your work on this project.  You are doing a great 
job.

Mike

Thank you for contacting me.  The new baby is doing great.  I would like to 
add you guys to the box if you are interested.  I would also like to have 
your west physical guys on my box.  It has been brought to my attention that 
APB has great fixed price physical flow.  If you are not aware, I am running 
the physical desk as well.  Let everyone know that it will based on one 
condition - All numbers or no numbers.  We do not wish to participate in a 
closed market. 

Call me later.
