John

Following the interviews next week, suggest your management team get together to review the rotations for the Trading Track, to see if they continue to meet business/Employe needs to ensure we have accurate data from a tracking perspective.

Subject:	Existing Trading Track Rotations

 

Attached is the current list of rotations for the Trading Track participants and future assigned rotations (as decided at the time of hiring).    Can you please re-confirm you have these people in your group currently, as I appear to have conflicting information.  I will re-send, if any changes occur.

If there is any movement of these people between groups can you plese keep me in the loop.

Kind regards,

Karen.

Michael, how can we get with PG&E to determine where the discrepancy lies?

Subject:	PX credits & Schedule F in the PG&E bankruptcy

PG&E filed their Schedule F which displays its nonpriority unsecured claims.  Many of the claims were listed as unknown in amount.  The PX credit amounts were listed as disputed.   Two PX credit amounts were specified in the Schedule F:

Enron Energy Marketing      $201,964,905.64
Enron Energy Services       $ 19,737,979.97
Total disclosed PX credit   $221,702,885.61

Note that in the claims that were listed as unknown in amount, none were described as PX Credit in nature. 

Two points to be made: 1) this information is now public (but on page 5,066 of 17,096 on a CD), along with $53,985,167 in other Enron related claims, and 2) our calculation of the PX credit was $392,416,534 at the beginning of May.

Regards,


Michael

We are beginning to see some progress.  Anna will help them refine the view a little, then we need to get the phys vs. financial differentiations completed.

Are you referring to the EOP origination?  IT was working on the issue last night and I'll follow up this morning to see what the resolution was.  That information did not roll into the DPR.

I think that new deal info may have even rolled into the DPR.  can you check and could you get us a revised new deal report with accurate p&l.

Global Markets is maintaining that there are "accounting issues"  with the $1.25 million.  Should we get Faith Killen or Wes to get this wrapped up?

Do you want me to start having Total commodity V@R for Natural Gas on the morning reports? (inclusive of natural gas positions that power and other groups have on). I have noticed that we have V@R violations based on the new risk management policy to take all gas positions company wide into a V@R number.

Enron has allowed this program to be hosted in the Enron Building for
convenience of its employees.  Individuals are responsible for paying their
own fees.  Financial support from Enron is at manager's discretion and is
subject to the usual tuition reimbursement constraints around budget and
relevance to organizational performance.


HOW TO ENROLL:
     1.  Print out the attached registration form.
     2.  Complete the form, but please note the following
          SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:
          A.  Fill out the student information completely, including
               your email address.
          B.  In the Enrollment section, where it says "Please enroll
               me in GMAT Class Size-8 Course # _________",
          C.  In the Payment section:  For the course at Enron, the

Call (800)2REVIEW to register or to receive a list of course schedules.

IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:
     The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business
school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic
that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work
experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of
your application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can
substantially improve in a short period of time.

THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:
     All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA
Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA
Tour, of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business
schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.  The
participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.
The Princeton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so
call
(800) 2REVIEW to register.

Rogers,

The only other detail that I have is that it is a FIRM delivery, full requirements contract, and the monthly volume fluctuated from 7,000 MMBtu to a monthly high of 32,000 MMBtu.  The P&G Plant is located in Lima, Ohio on the West Ohio Gas, a local distribution company.

I don't have much more detail as the user information at EnergyGateway.com is confidential.  But we know that ENA was the lowest bidder and that EES/EWS was the second lowest bidder.  

There may be an overlap of responsibilities here where we could help out and consolidate these retail positions.

Jess -

Can you provide some more detail here. 

John, I have always been told that the East desk did not wnat to consolidate the scheduling of retail with wholesale due to all of the balancing risks associated with load like this.  I am ok with them bidding on load, but I think this is a sign that we should begin consolidating scheduling functions under wholesale - I think this would be most efficient.

I'm confused by this one. Who in ENA is bidding this stuff and did we know about the balancing.

Don/Rogers,

We have a situation that occurred today where ENA beat us on a retail gas deal.  I don't know how accurate our information is in this case but I wanted to pass this on to you for further consideration:

1.  Energy Gateway is a retail gas portal where users can request proposals for gas supply to Commercial and Industrial sites.

2.  EWS Gas Desk (fka EES Gas Desk) monitors and makes offers on the system where the buyers meet our requirements.

3.  Procter and Gamble requested bids today for a site inside West Ohio Gas that is supplier balanced.

4.  P&G wanted a one year deal beginning 7/2001.

5.  Load was shaped and averaged 534 MMBtu/day or 195,200 MMBtu per year.

Bottom line:  We were beat by ENA by 7 cents/MMBtu.  

I don't think we need to compete against each other and had ENA not bid we would have been the low bid at a price that was 7 cents higher.  Your thoughts?

Are you Ready2Go ?
Have you ever experienced problems accessing the network remotely when traveling on business or when trying to work from home on your laptop?  Would you like someone to test and customize the dial-up access on your laptop before you head out of town on your next trip? 

We have identified a need and are now supplying a new service for Enron Wholesale Services and EBS employee's...

	It's just for you and it's called Ready2Go !

This new service has been established to test, modify, and update the dial-up software on your laptop.

How it works:
A calendar has been created on ITCentral at <http://itcentral.enron.com/Data/Services/Ready2Go>
You can go to the site and schedule a time that is convenient for you. Then, you will need to bring your laptop to our testing site, (either at 3AC1631D or EB2249B).  We will examine your system, update your software (if needed) and even customize it for the next location you will be traveling to.  We'll also provide a brief training session in accessing the network remotely with your laptop.

If you are interested in participating, simply access the web site and schedule an appointment.

Thank you for your time.

All,

Thank you for responding with updates with respect to the current rotations of the Trading Track Participants.

Attached is the revised version.  I expect this may somewhat revise subject  to any new intake of TT candidates.


Thanks, Karen.

hi Kam,

This is Punit. I have received this email from you but have no other earlier than this one. so when u say 'again' i dont understand. i didnt know i was in such a position and tho i tried to work this from home...i was told i wud not be able to do it unless i put in an 'e-request' which i am in the process of doing. Also i think someone else is trading off my account cos i was on leave and not scheduled to come in till 1730 today and to my surprise i find that there were trades on my account!!!

Please look into this closely including the VaR violation thing.


Thank you.


Punit.


P.S : these are the trades that popped up in my account today from nowhere.

Punit,

You have exceeded your VaR limit again today.  I will be taking $100,000 from your P&L tonight.  You must decrease your position today.

John:

Bases on the conversations I have over heard I understand there are discuss=
ions being held regarding the Enron Corp 1994 Deferral Plan and the value o=
f the ENE stock held in those accounts related to a single sum distribution=
.  As you and I discussed previously I do not fault anyone for wanting to t=
ake their Deferred Values out subject to the 10% penalty.  After having str=
uggled with the issue I do find a problem with the various interpretations =
of how the ENE stock should be valued.  Any method other than  the number o=
f shares times the current market value is not fair to the thousands of Enr=
on employee's who had ENE shares in there 401K account and were not afforde=
d a look back option.  Some might say this is easy for me since I did not h=
ave ENE stock in either, but I do feel its a matter of treating everyone fa=
irly.  Most employee's do not have access or knowledge of the Deferral Plan=
 so it would probably go unnoticed, but that would not be equitable.  The s=
olution in my mind, if the plan participants do not agree would be to deny =
an early single sum distribution which is a right, per my interpretation un=
der the plan, this may encourage acceptance of the plans interpretation of =
the ENE stock valuation.  I appreciate your reading my input!

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Industrial Markets	
The Transaction Development group (TD) is responsible for corporate development, transaction execution and portfolio management activities within EIM.  TD is responsible for asset and corporate acquisitions to support EIM's efforts in the Forest Products and Steel industries.  TD works with EIM's Forest Products and Steel Origination groups to structure and execute complex transactions for EIM's customers.

Enron Freight Markets
Enron Freight Markets has continued to expand the transportation services offered to its customers and completed several flatbed truck moves outbound from Georgia this week.  There was a shortage of flatbed equipment supply in this market and EFM was able to obtain more than three times the normal margin on each move.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron arranges first gas pipeline import into Italy
Enron has continued its pioneering activities in the Continental gas market by arranging the first gas import into Italy.  The Italian team worked with the Continental Gas desk to arrange this strategically important agreement with Blugas SpA., the wholesale gas company formed by the municipalities of Cremona, Lodi, Mantova and Pavia in north-eastern Italy.  Enron has sourced 100,000 cubic metres per day of natural gas from northern Europe to transport to Italy, transiting it through Germany and Switzerland, despite fierce resistance from Ruhrgas and TransitGas respectively.  

Aside from isolated LNG imports by incumbent monopolies this is the first time that any company has managed to import natural gas by pipeline into Italy since the Italian gas sector was officially liberalised in August 2000. The gas, which started flowing at 06.00 on Thursday 17th May 2001, will be used to meet the needs of two thirds of Blugas' residential customers within the four municipalities. The current contract lasts for five months.

Congratulations to Fabio Greco, Carsten Haack, Didier Magne, Michael Schuh, Marco Lantieri and Daniela Uguccioni.

Enron in the Middle East 
Enron has relinquished its stake in Dolphin Energy, the joint venture company formed to develop gas reserves in Qatar.
Enron has agreed to transfer its 24.5 per cent stake in the project to the United Arab Emirates Offset Group (UOG), the majority shareholder. The agreement allows Enron to deploy capital elsewhere and gives UOG the opportunity to seek new partners before the project moves into its next phase.

Development of the Emden/Oude gas hub moves ahead fast
An important milestone in the evolution of the new gas trading hub on the Dutch-German
border was reached last week. Last Friday some of the major European gas players held a meeting to officially establish the Emden/Oude gas hub. Although Enron had already initiated the development of the Emden/Oude hub by making a market through EnronOnline as early as December 2000, the goal of this meeting was to set up a working group similar to the Zeebrugge focus group who can  work on setting a legal framework for the Emden/Oude hub. 

Enron was elected as the only new market entrant in this group, reflecting the high level of respect industry peers have for Enron as a major player in the Continental gas market -- even from incumbents!

We have designed an additional Daily Position Report which consolidates P&L, positions, maturity gap, and VAR by commodity rather than business unit.  In accordance with the Risk Policy paragraph III - Limit Structure, possible breaches of limits are monitored against commodities rather than Business Units.

This report is currently being published to the Executive Viewer under the name of DPR RAC (will be retitled to DPR commodity). We are in the process of granting each one of you access to this report.  When access is granted to all DPR viewers, we plan to remove the limits amount off of the Business Unit Daily Position Report as the limits are granted by commodity, not business unit.

Please contact me with any questions/comments or concerns.

Thank you

You handed this back to me about 8 weeks ago and said "put it to one side and we'll maybe offer later on". Is now "later on"?

A short summary published today about the legal situation.  

Growing Legal Problems for Energy Rationing Program
The legal battle provoked by the government 's energy rationing program
intensified Thursday with a S?o Paulo judge throwing out the program 's
penalties.
Thursday night,a judge in the city of Mar?lia,S?o Paulo issued an injunction
suspending all of the penalties contained in the program for households or firms
that exceed quota levels for electricity consumption.The injunction was in
response to a challenge of the penalties filed by a federal prosecutor and is
applicable to the entire country.
The judge ruled that higher energy charges and the threat of a momentarycutoff of electricity for persons or companies that exceed their quotas were
unconstitutional.
Also on Thursday several Supreme Court justices stated that they have no
doubts that a controversial decree issued by the government Wednesday is
unconstitutional.The decree states that measures taken to combat the energy
crisis do not have to respect Brazil 's consumer protection code.According to the
justices,who declined to be identified,the decree violates three articles of the
constitution.
In S?o Paulo,the number of suits challenging the government program
reached seven in the federal district court while in Rio a total of four suits had
been filed by the end of Thursday.
Thus far the government 's only response to the program 's legal problems
has been to mobilize federal attorneys to overturn any injunctions issued by lower
court judges.At some point,however,the government will also have to deal with
the damage to its image caused by the unpopular aspects of the program.
In related developments Thursday:
*the head of the energy crisis management team Pedro Parente said that the
government would consider a proposal defended by some electricity utilities to
declare every Monday a holiday.Parente said his team would analyze the
economic impact of such a measure which would be only be adopted if the current
rationing program fails to produce the needed 20%cut in electricity consumption.
* the government created a special group of energy experts to prepare the
details of a program of rolling blackouts similar to what has been applied in the
American state of California,also suffering from an energy crisis.Thus far
blackouts have been ruled out in Brazil and would only be adopted if absolutely
necessary.
*the water level of reservoirs for hydroelectric plants is continuing to decline.
According to figures for May 23,the average level in the southeast and central-
west regions was 29.5%,down from 32%on May 1,a reduction of 7.5%.In the
northeast,the average level fell from 32.6%to 28.5%over this same period,a
reduction of 12.6%.Thus far the decline in consumption is not keeping pace with
the reduction of generating capacity.For the week May 17-23,consumption in
the southeast and central-west regions fell 4.6%and in the northeast the decline
was 5.4%.
*the Brazilian Association of Shopping Centers (Abrasce)proposed to meet
its consumption quota by reducing the shopping period by two hours a day.Malls
would open an hour later than at present and close an hour earlier.
*the government is expected to announce today the energy quotas for
specific business sectors.Each sector will be required to reduce its consumption
by between 15%and 25%.

A couple of questions:

Will you need to keep an office here after Friday?

At what time can the move team begin your move on Friday evening?

Thanks!

The net beneficiary of Lay's decision is Dynegy. Why wouldnt he give it to the employees vs. forfeiture??? I just dont get it.

From: 	Ken Lay - Office of the Chairman  
Sent:	Tuesday, November 13, 2001 5:18 PM

Subject:	Change of Control Provisions


As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

Just to follow up from our meeting yesterday morning, the total present val=
ue benefit from Project Slapshot is approximately $100 million (we do not a=
t this point know the exact benefit because it is dependent on the yet unde=
termined interest rate to be charged in connection with the EIM financing).=
  The benefit will be realized by EIM Canada and Enron Canada Corp. through=
 a reduction in the amount of taxes paid by each company.  The risk related=
 to the transaction is that the interest deductions from the transaction ar=
e denied in part and, as to the part denied, EIM Canada and Enron Canada Co=
rp. are required to pay interest to Revenue Canada on the amount of income =
offset by such denied interest deduction.  I will forward to you a calculat=
ion of the potential interest charge to Enron Canada Corp. in this circumst=
ance as soon as I confirm with our Canadian counsel the method by which suc=
h interest charge is calculated, and the likely rate at which it would be i=
mposed.  A more remote risk (due to actions we are taking in the financing =
documents) stemming from the transaction is that Revenue Canada could asser=
t a withholding tax on interest payments made by EIM Canada to the lender i=
n the transaction.  This risk would fall on EIM Canada.  I believe that it =
is highly unlikely that either risk will ever be realized and have obtained=
 the highest level of comfort on this point possible from our Canadian coun=
sel absent their telling us that there is no risk (specifically, Blake, Cas=
sels believes that there is a 70 to 80 percent likelihood that our position=
 will be sustained if challenged).  I am attending the Enron Tax Conference=
 on Thursday and Friday of this week but can be reached at 713.817.5052 sho=
uld you have questions regarding this transaction.  Best regards.  SHD.

Obviously not a priority, but some of the trading track guys are carrying $1,000,000 V@R overnight on the premise that a $10,000 penalty isn't going to hurt them if the market is down $.10.  Should we remedy this?

On May 10, 2001, a memo was sent out regarding "Peer Group Mapping".  This mapping is intended to illustrate from a functional view point where each activity was placed at Year End 2000 VP PRC.

Please refer to the attached original memo, if you have not responded to David Oxley and have any comments 
please respond to him by May 25, 2001.

Dave Delainey



Following my note last week please find attached the consolidated peer group mapping for all business units. This mapping is intended to illustrate from a functional view point where each activity was placed at Year End 2000 VP PRC.

We were considering moving to a 3 Peer Group Structure however it as agreed at the last PRC Committee Meeting  to stay with the current structure since the data had been cleaned and everyone felt generally comfortable where most activities had been placed with the exception of just  2 or 3. It was agreed that we should concentrate on resolving these rather than undertaking an organization wide remapping excercise to consolidate to 3 Peer Groups. All functions/activities within the business units should now be reflected on the acttached. 

The actions points from this excercise are:

1	to review and agree the attached mapping 

2    consider and comment on highlighted groups that we have discussed in previous PRC meetings and ask for your comments or objections to moving them 	as indicated on the attachment.

3	invite your comments or questions on any other function that you consider questionable or requiring further explanation.

      Please return your comments to David Oxley by Friday May 25.

      To have this discussion now will save lengthy discussions in the final VP/MD PRC Meetings.  Definitions of the peer groups are also attached for your ease of
      reference.

John -

The current functional reporting structure of Billing & Settlement's through EES poses near term and long term tactical risks we  feel jeopardizes our ability to meet our goals and objectives.

Currently, Deal Capture and Risk Analysis/Reporting report through Sally Beck.  However, Settlements and Billing report through Evan Hughes (EES).  As such, the reconciliation process (Wes Colwell and Wade Stubblefield) is held hostage to any piece that breaks down.  In this structure we (ENA) are able to control the progress and performance of Deal Capture and Risk Reporting.  We are making progress on these fronts.  We are completely out of the loop re: current state of affairs on the billing side (other than it just doesn't work).  We are also out of the loop in assuring the proper approach and solutions are being  implemented.  

According to Anthony Dayao and other, there are approximately 11 different billing systems that feed CSC (we outsource billing to CSC apparently).  Billing Group spent several months attempting to scope out the process and future requirements.  This was done in conjunction with Union Finosa.  I think that approximately $6.8 MM has been spent to date on this effort w/ Union Finosa (Anthony, is this accurate).  Union Fin recently provided the group with a proposal and Anthony has negotiated 60 - 90 days to review and respond (Apparently, Billing wanted to go forward with just one week of comments).  Bottom Line:  this does not appear to be the proper approach to ensuring that we are solving our comprehensive billing/settlement issues as well as near term necessities.

PROPOSED SOLUTION:
Billing/Settlements should report to Sally Beck (dotted lines to ENA and EES)
EES can maintain customer interface through call centers and logo on invoice
Convene an immediate meeting with Evan Hughes, Anthony Dayao et. al. to summarize current state (including Union Fenosa)
Retain Accenture or KPMG to fully scope out current reality vs. business needs
Implement action plan to address long term solution vs short term necessity.

Until we can resolve this, I am afraid that 1) decisions are being made without full consideration of ENA's view of business needs and 2) ENA cannot be accountable for when and if we can ever provide monthly reconciliations and flash to actuals.  As we all recognize, unless you can reconcile the books, you really don't have a legitimate business.

John, could we convene a meeting if necessary for you to address these issues.  I will be out next week and would like to leave knowing that we are on the path to getting this resolved.

Thanks,
Rogers

Per ENA Executive Mgmt.  the following signature requirements should govern:

EAST
> 50,000 Mwh's,  <250,000 Mwh = Berney Aucoin or Rogers Herndon
>250,000 Mwh's = Kevin Presto and Rogers Herndon 
> 1,000,000 Mwh's = see below

Kevin and John, I recomend we require John Lavorato signature on deals > 1,000,000 Mwh at least until we get our hands around all of the issues.

Your comments?

Subject:	EWS versus ENA in West Ohio Gas

Don/Rogers,

We have a situation that occurred today where ENA beat us on a retail gas deal.  I don't know how accurate our information is in this case but I wanted to pass this on to you for further consideration:

1.  Energy Gateway is a retail gas portal where users can request proposals for gas supply to Commercial and Industrial sites.

2.  EWS Gas Desk (fka EES Gas Desk) monitors and makes offers on the system where the buyers meet our requirements.

3.  Procter and Gamble requested bids today for a site inside West Ohio Gas that is supplier balanced.

4.  P&G wanted a one year deal beginning 7/2001.

5.  Load was shaped and averaged 534 MMBtu/day or 195,200 MMBtu per year.

Bottom line:  We were beat by ENA by 7 cents/MMBtu.  

I don't think we need to compete against each other and had ENA not bid we would have been the low bid at a price that was 7 cents higher.  Your thoughts?

The natural gas desk lost approx. $67MM, with the west desk reporting a loss of $55.8MM.

To confirm our meeting, in order of timing and/or commitment size priority, we need a summary of the following:

1.  What is the actual amount of the funding commitment, including the amount funded to date?

2.  When is the funding commitment required?

3.  What is the nature of the funding commitment - firm, or non-firm but advisable (and if so why)?

4.  What are the consequences of not funding from a business or project perspective?

5.  What are the consequences of not funding from a legal perspective, including any limited liability/spe protection?

Teresa and I should be able to fill in 5 once we have the answers on 1-4.

Teresa will you please work on outlining 5 in the interim.

Timing obviously depends on when the amounts are required, and the sooner the better.  It would be helpful if we could have something by Thursday evening latest.  Suffice to say, John will not be predisposed to fund these unless he understands the nature of the obligations.

Greatly appreciated.  Peter.

Sure sounds to me that Ken is in the same shoes as the rest of us regarding the downfall of ENE.  
What do you think????????????????????????
Wouldn't you think the honorable thing would be to refuse any compensation knowing your terrible performance? 
I'm sorry! I forgot honorable is not an Enron admirable trait!

The wording of "If he terminates his employment within 60 days of a change of control" sure sounds to me like someone knew what was going on to me?
I guess we should have kept in mind the 2nd definition of LAY in the dictionary is "To put to rest"

 DJ Enron CEO -2: Also To Get Reimbursed For Tax Penalties --

  WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--Enron Corp. (ENE) Chief Executive Kenneth Lay could
receive a lump sum payment as much as $80 million as a result of Dynegy Inc.'s
(DYN) plan to acquire Enron, according to a regulatory filing released Tuesday
by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
  Under Lay's employment agreement, which originally extended through Dec. 31,
2003, Lay was entitled to a lump sum payment equal to the number of full
calendar years remaining under his contract multiplied by $20.2 million if he
terminated his employment within 60 days of a change of control. 
  In August, Lay, chairman of Enron, resumed his position as CEO following the
resignation of Jeffrey K. Skilling, Enron's then-president and CEO. At that
time, his contract was extended to Dec. 31, 2005. 
  In addition to the lump sum payment, Lay is entitled to an amount for any
related tax penalties if the payment were held to constitute an "excess
parachute payment," according to the filing. 
  Dynegy plans to acquire Enron in a stock swap valued around $10.12 billion. 
  The deal is expected to close sometime next year, in which case Lay is
entitled to $60.6 million under his contract if he terminates his employment
within the 60 days.

John/Louise

As of now I will also be working on the general A&A pool for ENA as well as working with you on the Trading and Orig. Tracks.    I just got the numbers from the A&A program on the ENA Participation on the forthcoming A&A Fantastic Friday/Super Saturday Interview dates.   As you can see ENA's participation is very low (pretty dismal).      The de-brief sessions basically allows interviewers to select the candidates to their groups there and then... so ENA has to be there.    

Oct 26 has only 5 ENA interviewers all the remaining interviewers are EES and EIM.    I know EES are stacking quite heavy on the A&A side.    Therefore, I will shortly be e:mailing your direct reports to solicit their and their direct report's participation in these interviews. It would be helpful if this could be re-inforced by you.

Many thanks!.

Karen.

Remi

Things are changing.
This issue is still under discussion and the new proposed measures allow consumers to sell to generators, distributors and traders.
If this happens, their price is going to raise to MAE price (or close to). The main issue now is "Is MAE goig to start settling?".
I'll keep informing you guys.

Subject:	Re: mae measures   

That's one of the topics I wanted to address PRIORITARILY this afternoon.  According to Luis Otavio and Fred, customers A (alta tens?o, and demand greater than 2.5MW) will ONLY be allowed to sell "excess power" not consumed (capped at their "cota" or "meta" or quota) to OTHERS CONSUMERS, but not to MARKETERS.  The reason for this is that ANEEL/Parente don't want to "flood" MAE with positions to settle (the argument is, if MAE cannot manage 67 counterparties, they won't be able to manage several hundreds).  But it's crazy: all unbalanced (net) positions will be settled in spot market: if marketers are not allowed to act as intermediaries, there will be hundreds of net, bilateral positions to settle (and it WILL flood MAE), if marketers like Enron can be in the middle they will net themselves all positions on portfolio basis and they will show only ONE position in MAE.

This mechanism is no different from the often discussed concept of DEMAND SIDE MANAGEMENT.  The only way to make it work is to allow LIQUIDITY and therefore competition and therefore Marketers. 

It is vital that Marketers be authorized to acquire and sell this power, and settle their net position (net position only) in spot market.  EOL will be a great tool for this, and we may accelerate its launch in Brazil with this new, different product ("Restricted Power")

Subject:	mae measures

One of the proposals under review with the Apag?o team is to allow the B and A costumers to access the Mae and transact their "contracted energy" after their respective 20-25% reduction targets.  The MAE and the distributors do not have the systems in place to deal  with over 1,800,000 customers in the entire system. Elektro alone has close to 150000 customers in this class.    This can be a tremendous oportunity for Enron on Line to take off.  Remi could you review and prepare an action plan urgently.  These measures are targeted to be released next week.

highlights of my discussion with dave:
he wants an "opportunity" to originate out of the ees positions.  for example, the harrah's deal generated approximately $16 million relative to the mid, of which $4 went to ees.  he wants a chance to back this deal with his sourcing group.
he was unable to offer any definition around what the word "opportunity" means.  one interpretation of "opportunity" is that they get a head start, say three months to back a deal where neither west mm or west orig works on that deal for three months.  another interpretation is that west mm and west orig aren't allowed to talk to certain wholesale customers, for example the generators.  both of these are bad ideas.
i asked him why enron would want to keep its most talented origination resources on the sidelines for any period of time in order to let the kid brother (ees) have a "fair" chance at winning a deal.  i also asked him if he thought his crack squad could compete with the capabilities that we have developed in the west.  his answer was no.
i told dave that as the manager of the retail risk book i don't care who originates out of the transaction.  my thinking is that i give a copy of the harrah's contract to calger, foster, and delainey.  whoever gets us out first gets paid orig.  if people want to coordinate then that's fine.  if they want to compete head to head then that's fine.  speaking for portland, i would expect that west mm and orig would coordinate.
dave then said that he "gave" us the risk function and insinuated that we owed him something in return.  i indicated that i was willing to give it back and return to my simple life managing the west wholesale trading desk if that's what he wanted.  i think he took offense to that comment.
we hung up with no resolution.  dave called me back and proposed that we let anyone originate out of the position.  however, the origination dollars would go to ees profit center with the west mm or origination person getting the credit for that.  he talked about ees and the stock price and the billion dollar business.  my guys (i'm not speaking for chris here) don't care where the origination dollars go to so long as they get paid for bringing value.
i suggested that he work it out with you and that i would be looking for direction from you.

i'm pretty sure that dave will characterize our conversation as though we are in a agreement and that we are ready to move forward.  i would say that we agree that we need to get the best people originating out of these deals.  i would rather that the money for orig stay with whoever originated it.  i can live with a variety of outcomes.  i'll sit tight and wait for direction from you.

Hi John,
Attached is the marks we are using to mark our books as of Nov 15th.  Please
have your guys drop in your marks for the same day and send back to us.  This
should clear up 90% of our differences.
In addition, your help on some 3rd party book outs would help us reduce our
overall position size. We were working on one with Williams, when Kevin Presto
objected unless he was able to earn the bid/offer.  We would like to do the
following:

MS sells to Enron
Enron sells to Williams
Williams sells to MS

----100 mw of "Into SOCO" all at the current markt price.

Thanks for your help.

Regards,
                Joe Delaney

John, I want to re-confirm your approval to enter into a new lease. We need to give notice to Canterra by end of June on whether we are extending for an additional 3 years to June 2005 or terminating our lease June 2002. 

I'm currently negotiating on 3 different sites as well as discussing the extension with Oxford:

Canterra		3 year lease - no renewal rights - $26sq/ft at 20,000 sq. ft. No ability to expand contiguously. Currently, at capacity.

TCPL Tower		Conoco has 3 floors (26,27,28 at 25,000 sq.ft/floor). With Gulf takeover, they will consolidate into Gulf Square. Looking for 3 floor 				sub-lease tenant. Likely $25/sq.ft 10 year lease w/renewal rights. Good floor-plate (column-free rectangle). One floor would likely be 			adequate for the next few years. Would overlap canterra lease by likely 9 months.

Bankers Hall		Calpine has 2 floors (39,40 at 19,000 sq.ft/floor). With Encal takeover, they will consolidate into Canada Trust. Looking for 2 floor 				sub-lease tenant. Likely $25/sq.ft. 10 year lease w/renewal rights. One floor would be less than adequate - 2 floors would be more 				than we need for the next few years. Would overlap canterra lease by likely 9 months.

Phillips Warehouse	2 floor warehouse being converted to 3 floor office bldg. 10 year lease w/renewal rights on 35,000 sq.ft at $20sq/ft. Will build to suit and 			Enron would have building naming rights. Timing with expiry of Canterra lease is good (Occupy date would be 1st qtr, 2002). 

My preference is to target the Phillip's brothers warehouse.Timing, location, price, sq.footage, parking all look good. They are willing to deal with us exclusively and have aspirations of designing a state-of-the-art office building (this is consistent with their reputation) while Calpine/Conoco want to free-option us while they look for multi-floor tenants (much like what happened when we made an offer on TCPL tower previously and they used it to lever Hunt Oil into a mulit-floor lease).  

Let me know your thoughts on this as I need to move fairly quickly.

John, first off, congrats on your promotion! 

You may recall that our Canterra lease expires June, 2002. When we consolidated our floor space on 35, we were able to incorporate an option to extend the 35th floor lease (at market rate approx $24 sq.ft) for an additional 3 years to June, 2005. Notice to extend has to be provided June of this year. 

The reason I'm bringing this to your attention is that I'm concerned that we will not be able to accomodate any growth for years 2002 - 2005 in our current space. We will be at 115 employees this summer (150 sq. ft./employee) and our max is 130 (135 sq.ft/employee) which should get us through June 2002.

Given this, I have explored a number of leasing opportunities outside of Canterra with the goal of finding a floor plate more conducive to a trading organization. You may recall that TransCanada was in the process of building a new office tower across from Esso Plaza. They are now in the process of sub-leasing a number of the floors. 

The tower was designed for their own trading organization and is the largest column-free floor plate in Canada (28,000 sq. ft.). It's state of the art technology includes a raised floor system for wiring (ie no coring). Coral Canada recently leased two floors in the tower for their Canadian trading operation. 

We are looking at the 31st floor at $24 sq. ft for a 10 year term with some overlap with our current lease for build-out. At 135 sq. ft/employee we would be able to staff 200 employees. However, given the rectangular/column-free floor plate, we probably could get down to 100 sq. ft/employee (270 employees). This should be sufficient for many years to come.

Please let me know whether we should proceed in negotiating a lease with TCPL.

Regards
Milnthorp

John,

A dangerous environment is brewing on the trading floor.  We have very large positions and people are becoming more frustrated with the work environment, uncertain about future employment and now with new information about Lay's "golden parachute", I am concerned that not everyone may act in the best interest of the Company (hero or zero attitude) or at a minimum may not be in the best frame of mind to trade.  I hate to suggest it but do you need to reduce the people allowed to take risk for the Company? (similar to what was done when we sold HPL).  The general feeling is that everyone at the top is taking care of themselves and the "little" people that have been making the money for the Company are left out in the cold.  I also suggest that you move quickly to ensure appropriate compensation for key traders into next year.

I know the first move I suggested would have the effect of reducing morale further but this group has a lot of risk on for people that may not be 100% commited to Enron.  This may be too drastic action at this point but I think it should watched closely.

Frank,

Please can you verify for John that this change to VaR makes sense from your perspective given your independent analysis of the price curves. The existing VaR calculation assumes a power to gas correlation in Texas of 47% and the empirical evidence shows something in the order of 93%. I believe that, while we have provided this data, you and Mike have found it to be accurate and agree that VaR should drop by the amount stated below.

I realize that, in order to process this change company wide you need to recalculate all the associated matrices and your group is working on that. In the meantime, as this is a material change to the East Power VaR, I would appreciate it if you could convey this to John so that he is aware of the change and is comfortable that it is not simply driven by the Desk but is a reflection of your work following our discussions relating to Power/Gas correlations in ERCOT.

Please let me know if there is anything else we can do to facilitate wrapping this up.

thanks,

Doug

Frank-

Doug is actually out of the office today, but I wanted to check with you and see where we are at on the issue of revising his correlations in the VaR engine.  The VaR for the Ercot desk is $6 million today (limit of $5 million), so I know he is anxious to resolve this.

Thanks!

Andrea

Doug,
Is this the same function used in Enpower's port calc?  As an aside, Mike brought up a point that the correl excel function is using actual prices, similar to calc'ing pnl using price instead of price change?seems like "correl" should be operating off second layer of data, ie. log returns or price changes?(variance, covariance)  

Out of due diligence, we should confirm that this is not the same function/operation utilized by valuation engine?(let's cross fingers)

Please keep me posted.
Thanks,
Frank

 << File: Doug_Correlation_103101.xls >> 

Here are the correlations for selected term structures. Please feel free to ask for further info if necessary. Based on this, it looks like moving the correlations closer to 70-80% would be prudent while still being conservative.

Thanks,

John, Milly has asked me to move the share certificates for Impact Energy t=
o Enron Canada's control.  These shares currently reside in a Morgan Stanle=
y account controlled by ENA.  As you may recall Enron Canada bought and pai=
d for these shares and special warrants.  Enron Canada directly owns 1,595,=
455 shares valued at USD$1.6 million and indirectly owns 1,300,000 shares (=
through JEDI) which Enron Canada beneficially owns 50% worth USD$650,000. T=
hese securities are worth USD$2.25 million to Enron Canada and I believe re=
present the only significant non trading asset in Enron Canada.  Enron Cana=
da proposes to move all the certificates to the control of the legal group =
of Enron Canada.  The logic is simple, Enron Canada has a fiduciary duty to=
 its shareholders and creditors to control its assets and if they need to b=
e disposed we are in the best position to realize full value for the securi=
ties.  Please advise if you have any problems with this proposal, otherwise=
 I will make it happen on monday November 26, 2001.

Thanks John

Attached please find a Tax Review of California Senate Bill No. 1 ("SB 1X").  The Tax Review sets out the practical implication (likely cessation of electricity sales and curtailment of investment in new generation assets) and constitutional deficiencies of SB 1X.  Please note, SB 1X will not apply to sales of electricity made pursuant to binding written contracts executed on or before the date SB 1X is signed into law (if ever).  

The California Senate has passed SB 1X.  The California Assembly has drafted their own version, Assembly Bill No. 128 ("AB 128X"), which the Assembly is presently debating.  A Tax Review of AB 128X is also attached.

We will keep you advised regarding the progress of both SB 1X and AB 128X.  Please advise if you have questions and/or comments.  Thanks.

Watch me carefully Joseph, as I snatch that bird from your hand, fry it up, devour it along
with some beer, and proceed to fall asleep with bird bones on my chest.  In other words, NO
DEAL!!!  Dem rubles are mine, sir!!

Subject:	Power Mid to Offer Reserve (effective 05.30.01)

Starting immediately, the value between mid and offer on all power deals done between EES and the third party will be held in reserve.  A report will be generated by counterparty/deal that will support the value of the reserve (this report will be similar in format to the origination report).  An assessment as to the need for the reserve beyond the 2nd quarter will be made in the next couple of weeks.  In the meantime, the only value that will flow through the DPR will be the MTM value of deals done with EPMI and the curve shift associated with the power positions.  Any questions, please do not hesitate to call.

John,
	Now that I've healed from the 175 mile biking experience, I wanted to thank you for your generous donation put towards the sponsorship of my MS-150 Houston-Austin bicycle ride.  It was much appreciated, and the money all goes to a good and worthy cause.  (Contrary to my initial gut impulse, the money did not go to the "Scott Tholan New Bike Fund").  
	Seriously though, thanks for your support.  Next year you ride too.  
	

--Scott 

PS  I recently sent in your check, and it should be deposited by the MS organization in the next several days.

Dear Greg,

I appreciate you coming down to the gas floor and providing us some information about what is going on.

One of the questions that kept getting asked had to do with who will be retained, and what we will be paid when we are retained.  We were told that star performers will be retained.  At what profit level do we become star performers?

I understand you and your staff have a tremendous number of things that need to be accomplished.  As I talk with my peers, the most important thing on our minds is if we will have a job and what we will be paid.  John was saying that in a few months this issue would be addressed.  My immediate concern is to secure employment while there are still positions available with other companies.  I will accept the first lucrative offer that is made to me.  My peers have expressed the same sentiment.  In a few months, there may not be any jobs left.   We have to may hay while the sun shines.  We all have been bombarded with calls from executive search firms.  We are all racing for a limited number of jobs that promise substantially higher salaries.

What we need on this floor is some assurances.  Maybe it should be in the form of granting bonuses now and offering employment contracts.  We need some exact numbers in the form of dates, salaries, and bonus plans. 

Scott Neal brought up this same question several times and John said he understood how critical this situation is.  If there are only trader track personnel left to run this company, will Dynegy still be interested?

Getting a bonus this year that reflects the work I put in is critical.  It is no where near as critical the issue of making sure my children have food on the table.  I do not have two months to wait to find out that the compensation I will be offered ends up being less than what a third party is willing to pay, or the bonus program is a based on a amount to appease me when I may have passed up a percentage deal.

Please sense the urgency that my peers and I are feeling.

Tom Donohoe

We tried all day to sell this volume below.  Market is extremely illiquid, given Annex V uncertainty and other regulatory issues: generators believe Parente will help them out in May, while LDCs look at their contracts and reduced demand.  However AES Sul accepted to buy this volume at 25% discount to May spot price, payment on June 25th.  We will net about R$600,000 (US$250,000) between sale and purchase prices.  Credit is OK.

We will keep a very small, long position at MAE settlement for May.

This is to inform that we have closed 2.200 MWh for May to AES Sul at 25% discount rate against spot price at southeast sub-market to be paid on Jun 25th.

Importance:	High


Louise,

I hope that everything is well with you.  Much has happened during the past two weeks and I will try to be as brief as possible.

Based on conversations and internal decisions that have occurred, Tom Byargeon and myself have decided to dissolve Production Offshore by the end of second quarter.  I have spoken with John regarding this commercial structural change and have also renegotiated the 2001 Upstream Products expected margin to $30 MM.  (The expected budget from Production Offshore was $20 MM out of the $50 MM for Upstream Products.)
I have attached a document that Tom has drafted outlining the remaining project responsibilities, market representation, and personnel redeployment.

The following individuals within Production Offshore have yet to be redeployed :

1. Tom Byargeon - He has been offered an opportunity to work with Randy Maffett, Vice President - Wholesale Origination, EGM.  Tom also will be meeting with Dave Duran tomorrow morning to discuss opportunities that exist within Generation Investments or Northeast Power Origination. 

 In addition, I want him to consider leading the Ecommerce/ Producer One effort for Upstream Products.  I desperately need a dedicated senior commercial person with contract negotiations expertise that can also see the financing opportunities that exist for Producer segment (i.e., wellhead connects, metering and monitoring equipment, etc.) through a Producer One transaction.  However, Tom has surmised that higher commercial visibility will be achieved by working on the financing of large asset deals within EGM or perhaps, in Duran's group.  I have assured him that the commercialization of the back and mid office is just as important if not more important to Enron's upper management.  Plus, I feel the closing of these outsourcing transactions will be more numerous by the end of the year than the other origination opportunities offered.

I know that he greatly respects your opinion.  If you could contact him (x30650) or drop him an email with your commercial perspective, I am sure that the correspondence would be greatly appreciated. 

2. Kevin Miller - mostly likely will focus on marketing and closing Producer ecommerce transactions.  In addition, Kevin has a very strong crude and processing background.  This experience would complement the Producer One effort as well support the processing needs of the Wellhead desk.  He could have career opportunities with EGM, but overall, is very enthusiastic about ENA's Producer ecommerce commercial platform.

3. Kenn Loch - has a very technical background suited for deepwater projects.  Since the responsibility for Mariner is within ECR, Allan Keel may be interested in his background.  Also, since the responsibility for the MEGS/Pluto deal should be transferred to ECR,  Kenn would be an appropriate resource for that transaction as well.

4. Lisa Druzbik -  is very familiar with the accounting details behind MEGS/ Pluto.  Has opportunities are within ECR and EES.  Most of her background is within the E&P sector.

I have spoken with Scott Josey about the impending dissolution of Production Offshore.  Since MEGS/Pluto is a deal with Mariner (and since Enron owns 97% of Mariner, the deal is analogous to doing a transaction with oneself), he concurs with me that the transaction should be evaluated with the overall restructure or potential sale of Mariner.  Should I transfer over to ECR all 2001 capital charges and associated earnings related to MEGS/Pluto?  Should this transfer occur as of the beginning of the year or at the end of second quarter? The YTD margin associated with this project is approximately $ 3 MM.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Regards, Mrha

John,

We have sold 200,000 shares of the 1.27 MM currently available for sale.

53,400 shares at $6.77
146,600 shares at $6.88

So, liquidity looks pretty good.

We will continue to liquidate.

harlan: for forwarding to dynegy

the framework re the sithe letter:
1.added cross default to master netting agreement.
2.added acceleration of ena's payment obligations in the event of default by enron parties under the master and close-out by the dynegy parties.
3.added set off right to dynegy parties if they end up owing under the master to the remaining payment obligations of ena.

re the master netting agreement which you will send:
1. added cross default to ena's payment obligations under the sithe letter.
2. added set off right to dynegy parties like in 3. above.

John, 

After your conversation with Paul yesterday, we have evaluated the option of moving all of GAS and POWER next weekend, we will be able to move everyone in a single move, however we will need a firm commitment by midday Tuesday, in order for us to get the workforce, move the broker lines and all the other tasks associated with this scale of move.

If you would like to proceed, please let me or Bill Donovan know as soon as practicable, so we can facilitate the migration. 

If we do not move next weekend, this will cause real problems with the resources and contracts in place, staff and suppliers are on vacation through thanksgiving and the move data will soon be out of date which will need to be reconciled which would increase the cost.


Martin Bucknell

will do.
 
The purpose of nymex on weekends is to make everybody in the industry bring up EOL every day.  There were a few days when I would get in at 7 and power traders in the industry were already trading gas either throught the broker market or on ice.  I'm trying to ensure EOL is the primary system used to trade gas.  However, it is a money loser.  If we gap down 10 cents over a weekend, I lose an average of 5 cents on 600 lots, $300,000, minus bid/offer on maybe 50 buy/sells of 30 lots times .005 is $75,000.  I don't really want to put more automatic products on the system that do little good as far as promoting EOL but are money losers. The one exception is Hub cash which I think should be a 24 hour 5 day a week product.  
 
Are the FedEx's getting to everybody Monday or are you sending them Monday?

I have attached a list of trade counterparties that have contacted us this week.  The only ones currently threatening to shut down trading are Koch and Koch-Entergy.  I will keep you apprised of changes.

We have approx 120 total seats for retail risk management on the 5th floor.   I think its important to put all power related retail functions (risk management, tariffs, structuring, risk reporting, etc.) on the 5th floor.

If you do this, then there will not be room for the retail gas group, which means you need to work with Tammy Shephard and Wes Colwell to get room on the 6th floor for retail gas.

Hello,

I was just dropping this note to see if anyone was interested in getting together for the Rice Owls homecoming game against Tulsa this weekend.  Game time is 2 pm and I thought we would get walk-up tickets (eveyman for himself).  If people are interested we would have a little tailgate party prior to kick-off and watch the 6-3 Owls (undefeated at home)  kill the Tulsa Hurricanes.  Drop me a line if you have interest as I am trying to get critical mass. 

Jon

PS. Please invite anyone that has interest in coming along and bring your kids if you have them.

I was unable to get complete estimates from the desk heads, however I believe that the natural gas desk loss approx 100MM today, the largest of the loss coming from the west desk.

Harrah's facilitated great WSJ coverage.  Also City of Chicago coverage.  I only included one
article, but EES got lots of coverage on TV and in print.  If anyone needs the whole package, let
me know.

Subject:	Enron Corp.: Harrah's Signs Pact    With Enron in Bid    To Cut Energy Costs


Marketing & Media
Harrah's Signs Pact
With Enron in Bid
To Cut Energy Costs
By Christina Binkley

06/08/2001
The Wall Street Journal
B6
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

  Harrah's Entertainment Inc. signed a seven-year energy-management
agreement with Enron Corp. that is expected to cut the casino company's
electricity and natural-gas costs by $2.6 million a year.

   Higher energy costs in Las Vegas have become a bogeyman to casino
investors of late, as Nevada's electricity prices have soared in the
past year. They are expected to rise a further 36% in the coming year. A
number of analysts have warned that the higher prices threaten expected
profits among major casino operators.
   A "real, severe threat of erosion in profits from energy costs" led
Harrah's to sign the agreement with Enron's Enron Energy Services unit,
said Gary Loveman, Harrah's president and chief operating officer, in an
interview. "There was an unbudgeted and uncontrollable effect on
profitability."

   The agreement, which the companies plan to announce today, is
expected to lead to savings that will add roughly a penny to Harrah's
annual earnings per share. A consensus of 19 analysts' estimates calls
for 2001 earnings of $2.14 a share, according to Thomson Financial/First
Call.

   The energy agreement applies to 16 Harrah's casinos in seven states.
Although other hotel companies have signed similar agreements with
Enron, Harrah's is the first gambling one to do so.

   The savings estimate of $2.6 million is based on an assumption that,
outside the agreement, electricity and natural-gas prices will rise
moderately during the next seven years. Harrah's now spends about $40
million a year on electricity and natural gas.

   The risk for Harrah's is that the past year's energy-price trends
reverse themselves. In that case, Harrah's wouldn't receive the benefit
of the lower prices. "We're buying a hedge. It's an insurance policy,"
said Mr. Loveman. "At a minimum, it allows us to budget."

   As part of the deal, Enron will also advise Harrah's on energy
conservation, from installing new boilers to adding new lighting systems.



Chicago And Its Suburbs Pick Enron, ComEd For Power Deals

06/07/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

 
  CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)- The City of Chicago and 47 suburban communities have
decided to divide new deals for 400 megawatts of power between Enron Corp.
(ENE) and local utility Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago officials said
Wednesday.
  In the largest power purchase agreement in Illinois since the state choose
to deregulate the industry in 1997, the local government groups will get 60%
of their power from Enron and 40% from Exelon Corp.'s (EXC) ComEd. The
municipalities use the power for public buildings and public transportation.

  "We used our purchasing power as local governments to get the best price we
could and at the same time to promote competition in Illinois," Chicago Mayor
Richard M. Daley said at a press conference.

  The government coalition sent out a request for proposals to the state's 13
registered electricity providers last summer requesting bids for cheaper
power, and also for power that's generated with 20% renewable supplies.
Combined, the municipalities currently pay ComEd about $110.6 million a year
for 400 megawatts of power, most of which comes from nuclear and coal-fired
power plants.

  Chicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the
renewable target by providing 80 megawatts of power created with landfill gas,
wind and other sources. ComEd will also provide the coalition with another 80
megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and Enron
will provide the other 240 megawatts. The new contracts are expected to go
into effect this year.

  Terms of the power deals weren't announced, as about 4,000 accounts between
municipal agencies and the two power providers must still be ironed out, city
officials said.

  But the government groups do have a target for savings. Chicago, which uses
about 200 megawatts and pays ComEd about $50 million annually for power,
expects to save a net $3 million a year through a combination of cheaper power
from Enron and more expensive renewable power from ComEd. Once all the
accounting is completed, it's likely the municipal groups will save up to $5
million in total each year, the city estimates.

  "Enron gave us the most competitive price," Daley said.

  ComEd officials' didn't calculate how much the new deals with the municipal
groups will be worth, now that the utility is positioned to lose contracts for
about 240 megawatts of power. Spokesman Bob Dwyer said, though, losing the bid
to supply the groups doesn't mean 240 megawatts will go unused. Instead, the
risk management arm of ComEd's parent company, Exelon, can now deal that power
to other companies on the wholesale market.

  Exelon is "looking to see what we can do on the wholesale market," Dwyer
said. "The market will tell us what can be done there."

  Exelon owns ComEd's former Illinois nuclear plants and supplies power to the
utility through long-term contracts. The plants, which combined produce about
10,000 megawatts, were transferred after ComEd merged with Philadelphia's PECO
Energy to form Exelon last year.

  ComEd plans to start supplying 40 megawatts of renewable power to the
municipal groups this year by purchasing supplies from companies developing
landfill gas recovery projects near Chicago. The additional 40 megawatts of
renewable power will be supplied within five years, when wind generators and
other projects are expected to be added in the state.

  In addition to creating cleaner air and saving money, the new power deals
are also designed to spur competition in Illinois' new retail electricity
markets, said Bill Abolt, commissioner of Chicago's Department of Environment.
Illinois is gradually spreading competition to different customer classes,
with all residential customers becoming eligible to choose their supplier next
year.

  "The marketplace has to be built," Abolt said.

Gas Desk made approx $2MM today.  West Desk reported a loss of approx $20MM.  Arnold had to catch a flight, so I estimated the Financial desk conservatively at 10MM.

Hello Dorie,

I know this is not the most opportune time, but we have a final decision on
the suite pricing.  This special rate was more than 50% off of the original
pricing for just one bedroom.  It was something negotiated between
ourselves and we can't justify a lower rate on a sold out night for Mr.
Lavorato when he continued to stay in the suite.  This might be different
had he moved to a regular room and we could have upsold someone else to the
suite.   However, we had to walk away from that revenue.    I hope Mr.
Lavorato understands our business position.  Please contact me if you have
any questions.

Physical Trading

East - The East did not notice any credit hording in the morning.  In the afternoon Tractebel is buying the physical balance of month .04 over the GD swap

Central - Dynegy Canada sold most of the gas to us.  The desk bid was .05 over NGX.  Nicor Hub would not accept an $87 pre-pay for a wheeling fee.

West - EOL Socal cash was trading .08 higher than ICE Socal.  The desk finished short and the market made it very difficult to buy.  EOL SJ cash traded .10 to .20 cents lower than ICE.  The only point without a credit spread was Opal.  Liquidity picked up slightly from Thursday and Friday, but still slow.

AEP was noticeably absent from all regions.

Hi Everyone...

1)  The forecast pattern seems very similar to what we've been talking about over the past several days.  6-10 features below normal in the Midwest and the East with a brief normalization possible toward the Great Lakes next weekend (days 8 and 9) before more cool air arrives.  11-15 indicates yet another trough digging into the East (temperatures normal to below normal) with the primary ridge remaining in the Southwest (above to much above).

2) 1-5 Day forecast also looks similar still quite cool for the East and Midwest - though not quite as hot for the immediate West Coast.  Above to much above normal temperatures will be common across interior California for most of the week with a 1 to 2 day spike of warm temperatures near the coast mid-week.  No prolonged period of heat will affect the Northwest.  

3) EarthSat will issue an "official" 6-10 and 11-15 forecast around 2pm today.  You can get this map by going to:  http://www.earthsat.com/misc/enron/   and then follow the "Sunday Update" link (near the bottom).  Login is "enron", Password is "enron".

Maps are attached - this is the way we feel things will look to start the day tomorrow.  *If there are any changes to this picture - it may be to warm the Midwest/ East closer to normal.  Right now this solution appears unlikely - but if there are any surprises tomorrow - it may be a SLIGHTLY warmer picture for the East.*  

 
Enjoy the rest of your weekend...
Research Weather Team

The network security group on EB34 just completed re-building
your Nortel router.  There were some filters that look like they
were causing the intermittant connectivity issues to non-Intranet
sites like www.enrononline.com <http://www.enrononline.com>
 
Part of it may have been the previous efforts to allow access for
you to the <http://ersys.corp.enron.com> website
 
In any case, you now have NetScape on both home machines,
and the next time you can bring the Compaq Armada laptop in
to the office -- Randy and I will make one more change that
will allow NetScape Communicator to "behave" at all sites.
 
There is not enough time to finish that here today, and there is
a 'profile' issue for your login ID that will not allow NetScape to
run at all until Information Risk Management and App-Integration
can see what is happening when it loads.
 
Have a good trip!

Enron may have to pay the CAISO $86 million in erroneous imbalance energy charges due to an EES data submission error.  The CAISO would then pay us the money back on June 19th.  I have already discussed this with a few people and am documenting a basic summary for those people who will have to get involved over the next few days if the CAISO board determines that we have to pay the money.  

Here is the summary:

EES submitted meter data to EPMI in kWh rather than MWh for one or more accounts for March CAISO activity.
This made EES appear to have underscheduled their load in March by a large amount.  The charges associated with this underscheduling total approximately $86 million.
EES has subsequently submitted the proper data which has been forwarded to the CAISO.
CAISO staff is fully aware of the error and understands that we don't owe them $86 million.  However, the tariff states that we should do a preliminary settlement on the data that was submitted and then a final settlement using the accurate data.
Per the tariff, we would owe them $86 million on Thursday May 31st at 10:00 AM PPT.  They would then refund the money to us on June 19th when Final Settlement payments go out.
The CAISO staff is taking two proposals to the CAISO Board today.  The Board could elect to do either of these, or strictly adhere to the tariff.  The first option is to allow us to re-submit our preliminary meter data with the right data.  The second option would be to pay them the $86 million but to keep it in some sort of escrow account until June 19th when they would pay it back.

Let's hope for the best with the CAISO board meeting today.  I'll will let everyone know what the outcome is and then we can formulate a plan.

The 11/1 e-mail (excerpt below) also notes that no event of default otherwise would occur, a fact specific inquiry; e.g., debt to cap ratio upon consummation of the merger:

Typical merger provisions provide that either (i) ENE survive or if not, (ii) 
the survivor be organized under U.S. (or state thereof) law, 
assume all obligations of ENE under the subject contract, and 
no event of default under the subject agreement would exist or result (whether an event of default would exist requires facts on a specific deal so covenants and other contract terms can be tested). 

To the extent that other groups reported to me differences from the typical provisions set forth above, I forwarded them onto to you.

Regards, NJD

In rereading your email from 11/1/01, whether Enron is the survivor of the merger makes no difference, as long as, if it's not the survivor, the survivor assumes the obligations.  Nothing seems to be triggered in the provisions described, as long as (1) the survivor has equal or better or investment-grade credit, which we assume will be the case, (2) the deal is done with approval of the Enron board, which has occurred, and (3) Enron survives or the survivor assumes, which would be case if we switch to a structure in which Enron does not survive.

Does any of the recipients disagree?

At 1pm Houston time today, Senator James Jeffords (R-VT) will announce that he is switching from the Republican Party to become an Independent voting with the Democrats.  If this happens, control of the Senate will switch to the Democrats, which will give the Dems a majority and control of the Senate.   

All committee chairs would become Democratic and the Dems would control the legislative agenda
	( Energy bills, California bailout, possible investigation of who influenced the Cheney plan etc.).  In a profound 	ideological shift, Sen. Murkowski (R- AK) would be replaced by Sen. Bingaman (D-NM) as chair of the Senate 	Energy Committee.   When Bingaman takes over the Senate Energy Committee, expect pipeline safety issues to 	again come to the fore.  Bingaman is a strong proponent of tough pipeline safety regulation (particularly in the wake of 	the Carlsbad explosion last year) and will likely insist on strict safety requirements in the Cheney energy bill.

The recommendations for loosening regulations for oil/gas drilling, coal and power as well as incentives for new generation contained in the Cheney bill are likely to be heavily revised in favor of more conservation-oriented measures.

The tax bill will likely be downsized, particularly if Jeffords makes his switch immediately.  The timing is important because the Senate-House conference on the bill must be appointed immediately.

All presidential appointments would be controlled by the Dems.  This is significant because of the large number of sub-cabinet level appointments that need to be approved.

At the same time, Republicans are trying to convince Sen. Zell Miller (D-GA), who already votes Republican, to switch to the Republican party.  If this happens, it will cancel out the expected Jeffords move.  Initial reports are that Miller will not switch.

One other caveat -- Jeffords has pondered a switch in the past and then flaked out.  But if Jeffords goes through with it and Miller stays put, the balance of power in Washington will be tipped in favor of the Democrats.

Jim, this issue is adequately covered in the lease and related documents which were blessed by you and the storage reservoir engineers.  Why this late expressed  concern?..........if you have facts which lead you to believe that AEP/HPL is operating this facility contrary to safe/industry standards or regulatory requirements or is otherwise endangering the facility, related facilities or the integrity thereof, please call me ASAP.   Sincerely

Barbara

I was wondering if the Bammel lease to AEP contains any operating parameters to protect the integrity of the facility.  The question arises from the fact that Bammel  had about 24 BCF of remaining capacity when Enron turned the facility over to AEP.  We believe their plan is to max inject in June which would reduce the remaining capacity to around 12 BCF.  It could become a challenge to keep injections under the remaining 12 BCF level during the reaming 4-5 months of the injection cycle.  Enron always operated the facility with the understanding that a Gas In Place volume greater than 117.5 BCF could create a high enough pressure to jeopardize the safety of the wellhead casings and some of the abandoned wells.  We would not want the Texas RRC to question the safety of the Bammel facility.  From the other end of the perspective if the Gas In Place is taken below 65 BCF their is a high probability of watering out the outer wells and the facility itself.

John,
 
Tim's view is the main reason I am trying to sell these tolls.  We sold our Las Vegas toll on-line (Dealbench) and I thought about putting these into EOL.  However, different companies want different delivery points, start dates and implied heat rates.  I think we have whet their appetite for the structure - if they don't transact, I think we should put a couple of structures online.  Sometimes the formality of a competitive auction makes people transact - and bid higher!

Have we thought about auctioning off a synthetic toll.  It might fit Tim's view and we have seen some interest in the East on the synthetic or purely financial side.

Deal Update: 

Las Vegas:  Meetings and site visits scheduled with Northland, Black Hills and Allegheny.  All have registered a lot of time on Dealbench.  Northland brought there investment bankers (CIBC) to Portland and hired an independent engineering firm.  We will have the info memorandum prepared this week tosend out to other potential purchasers if necessary.  Still on track.

AMPS: We are negotiating with two industrials, each can take the first two units.  Oregon Steel in Portland and Geneva Steel in Utah.  Geneva is a better site (permitting and infrastructure).  High elevation in Utah will derate the output of the units, but will likely be able to run most hours.  Oregon interconnects with Portland General (good) but permit will restrict hours (3,500 hours estimate).  We need to talk this week to discuss the form of the contract and value/risk transfer between ENA and AMPS.

Wind:   We completed a term sale to Edwards Air Force Base consisting of shaped energy and green tags.  Tags came from our existing biomass tags and Texas wind.  We will purchase the balance from Pacificorp.  We expect more activity here with other feds, some of the munis and 6-7 developers that we are working with.

Generator Tolls: We are trading term sheets with Allegheny, Reliant, Idacorp, Dynegy, NRG and Constellation re our offer to sell at NP-15, Mid-C and Palo - I think we will get something done this quarter.

Longview: We met with the head of BPA this week and got confirmation that he supports our Longview process and that his agency will not slow us down with their proposed regional air study.  Finding EPC contractors has been difficult so we may start discussions with NEPCO.

DWR: Should execute the Master agreement this week which will allow short-term deals with 7 day payment.

As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

I think that Presto honestly just didn't have time to read his.  Other than him, I consider this process finished and all other outstanding documents expired.
 
When I rework the summary we will sit down and talk about it.

Sean and Jim -

I would like to make sure everyone stays apprised and has opportunity to provide input regarding our efforts to provide EES with physical delivery capabilities.  To this end, I would like to make everyone aware of some current obstacles and some action we are taking to overcome.

Currently, we rely on the Site Profile group for long term load forecasting and load variability at the time of deal valuation and booking.  We are in the process of beefing up this effort with the goal of increasing accuracy and scientific approach.  Michael Frazier's group works to provide shorter term load forecasts where we have current physical obligations.

The problem: we do not currently have the ability to monitor our customers' load in a close to real time nature.  As such, we cannot verify our Site Profile Group's assumptions nor can we forecast load and minimize real time physical imbalances.  Without real time metering capabilities we realistically cannot build out our physical delivery capability.

Below is a description of the efforts we are taking to address the issue:

Lloyd Will's group (ENA Fundamentals and Services) is investigating interval metering technologies.  We are getting comfortable with the technology and our ability to capture the data on ENA servers and provide the real-time wholesale desk with real time load forecasts/revisions.  This will tie-in to Site Profile and Day Ahead Load Forecasting while giving us a fighting chance to minimize our energy imbalances.    
The cost side seems reasonable to me - roughly between $5,000 - $10,000, but don't take that to the bank yet as we are still researching data transmission fees (telephone/broadband) and install costs (possible sub-contract issues will need to be coordinated with EES to maintain customer touch)
We need to now prioritize customers that we will need to install/test first.  Obviously, physical delivery customers will be our focus.  We would like to target a test customer as soon as possible. 
Legal - Very important.  On a go forward basis, we need to insure that we include contractual language that requires our customers to provide a communication line (dial-up) and access to the utility meter.  We will need to review existing contracts or work through these issues with existing customers.  I was informed that Jim Keller may have worked on similar language with commercial gas contracts.

In addition, we will be negotiating with ComEd and AEP over the next month on several issues.  I will try to incorporate balancing services as well as meter installs and meter access directly with these utilities to expedite our efforts.

What we will need from EES is focus on the contractual and educational issues as well as cooperation in our effort to identify test customers.  

In order to grow the retail business, we have to build out our physical capability - everyone will continue to hear this from me.  To that end, I am very pleased with these developments as this could provide us with a real solution to the most significant obstacle - real time consumption data.  Thanks especially to Lloyd's group in taking the lead on preparing a game plan and addressing the data collection/IT issues.  

Sean/Jim - if you could begin to prepare for the contractual adjustments we will need that would be great.  Lloyd will keep us informed as to when we can begin the actual test phase.

Thanks,
Rogers

Guys, we are bringing through a VP candidate for your review.

Her name is Faye Worthy.  She has a great sales history in the energy industry and I think can really help us in the franchise market (ie) McDonalds, Safeway, Starbucks, Motel 6, etc.

I would really appreciate you spending a little time with her.   I will forward her resume.

Thanks
Dave

I have to say I honestly think we just need to leave this one alone and see how well eveyone is working together on the projects that are in hand particularly based on the new non-proift making role of EE&CC.  We always get noise in the system - with this group of people there are a lot of egos and fankly not enough concentration on the job.   At the current time they are separate entities, you have established your EPC group , let's review in a couple of months.  This is Enron these guys are used to uncertainty - its not necessarily bad for them.

Speak to you on the 11th.

Louise

John/Louise:

Brian Stanley and I discussed his proposal to consolidate the Enron America development engineers under EEOS.  As you know, there is a lot of noise in the system with respect this topic that is detracting from productivity.  I suggest that we need to make a definite decision on whether or not the ENA Tech Services Group will be consolidated into EEOS or will they remain as a separate group under ENA.  The stakeholders in this decision include the power/gas origination teams (e.g. Duran, Jacoby, Calger, etc.) the various technical groups, and RAC.  These groups should be consulted to ensure that whatever we do meets their requirements.

I have asked Brian S. to arrange a meeting when he returns from his trip on or about June 11th (with Louise on the phone) to discuss.  This will also ensure we get past some key dates in our construction projects.

Regards,
Brian

John

It would appear logical that in the right sizing of the of EIM and specifically the steel group that my commercial skills will likely not be fully utilized or possibly even required in the future. In turn I wanted to inquire of you if you believe there is another use of my skills within the organization prior to advancing outside of the company.

You know my capabilities well so I thought you could make a judgment call fairly easily and I then I can progress in whatever direction makes the most sense for both of us. 

I know you have a lot on your plate these days but I thought it would be easier ask you directly. Let me know your thoughts or if you want to have a cup of coffee.

Thanks

MFG

Subject:=09Government Affairs Organization Announcement


With the announcement of Enron's acquisition by Dynegy behind us, and with =
the initial severance process completed, it seemed an appropriate time to e=
ffect some organizational changes so that we as a group are better prepared=
 to meet the challenges of the future.  Before I turn to the organizational=
 changes, I would like to say a few words about those who will be leaving t=
he company as a result of the initial severance (you'll know who they are b=
y their absence on the organizational chart): Leading and being a part of t=
his group has been a privilege?I am thankful for every day that I have had =
that responsibility and thankful for however long I continue to have the re=
sponsibility.  This sense of privilege and thankfulness is primarily driven=
 by having had the opportunity to get to know and care about such a dedicat=
ed group of professionals and support staff and who, to a person, are also =
very decent and good people.  To say good-bye to some of our colleagues is =
not easy.  I want to, on behalf of all of us, thank them for their hard wor=
k, their integrity, their decency, and the good times and laughter that we =
shared.  I trust that many of us will find ways to sustain friendships that=
 have been and will continue to be very special.  Thanks to each of you who=
 are leaving for all you have done.

As to the organizational structure, it has become increasingly apparent to =
me that the existing organization, with a mix of groups organized along fun=
ctional and regional lines (particularly within the U.S.), has impeded our =
ability to get things done in the most efficient fashion at times.  The nee=
d to rationalize the organizational structure, in order to consolidate all =
U.S. energy functions, is a strong need from my perspective.  As a result, =
Jim Steffes will lead the U.S. Energy group along with Sue Nord, who will j=
ointly report to Jim and myself.  Sue will assist Jim in the leadership of =
the group and take on project management responsibilities as warranted to h=
elp Jim shoulder a significant burden.  Also reporting to Jim will be a lea=
dership group for U.S. Energy that will be as follows:  Wholesale Electrici=
ty will be led by Christi Nicolay; Retail Electricity and Natural Gas will =
be led by Harry Kingerski; Wholesale Gas will be led by Leslie Lawner.   La=
st, but not least, Jeff Dasovich and Sue Mara, who will continue to focus o=
n California energy issues, will report to Jim. (Sue Mara will also be part=
 of the Wholesale electricity team).

Steve Montovano, who will continue to report to me, will lead a commercial =
development effort along with Dan Allegretti.

With the elimination of the regional groups, I also recognize that there is=
 a need to continue to focus on how we as a group address our political/leg=
islative needs across the U.S.  Paul Kaufman will lead a small group that w=
ill address that need and that will focus on state political support.  Paul=
 will also take the lead for Government Affairs in support of corporate dev=
elopment efforts across the U.S.

Much of the rest of the group remains the same.  Linda Robertson will conti=
nue to lead the Washington group with Sarah Novosel, who reports to Linda, =
taking the lead role in our coordination of activities at FERC.  Amr Ibrahi=
m will continue to lead the support of the Global Assets group and also con=
tinue to manage the Risk Analytics function.  Maggy Huson will take over su=
pport of the non-energy business units, which are as follows: Global Market=
s, Industrial Markets, Networks, and Broadband.  Rob Hemstock will continue=
 to lead the support of Enron Canada.  Paul Dawson, who heads up government=
 affairs for Europe; Sergio Assad, who heads up government affairs for Sout=
h America; and Mike Grimes and Mark Crowther, who head up our Asian efforts=
, will continue to jointly report to the business units and myself.

I am also forming a North American leadership group for Government Affairs =
to provide policy guidance for the larger group and the company.  That Comm=
ittee will consist of Rob Hemstock, Maggy Huson, Amr Ibrahim, Paul Kaufman,=
 Harry Kingerski, Leslie Lawner, Steve Montovano, Christi Nicolay, Sue Nord=
, Sarah Novosel, Linda Robertson, Jim Steffes and myself.  We will also con=
tinue to have an RCR Committee that will consist of Maggy Huson, Harry King=
erski, Sue Nord, Linda Robertson, Jim Steffes & myself.  Finally, I am form=
ing a Dynegy/Enron regulatory approvals working group that will consist of =
Jose Bestard, Paul Dawson, Paul Kaufman, Sue Nord, Sarah Novosel and myself=
.

No organizational structure or set of organizational changes is either perf=
ect or permanent.  I believe these changes will make us better and more pre=
pared for the future.  However, we must be prepared to further adjust as th=
e future unfolds for the company.

One final note: I am deeply sorry that each of you has had to live through =
this uncertain and troubled period for the company.  We are all saddened by=
 the recognition that we are in the midst of changes that will leave our gr=
oup fundamentally altered, but we must resolve to do our best for each othe=
r and ourselves during this period of change to ensure that what emerges, f=
or those of us who do remain a part of the new Dynegy, reflects the excelle=
nce and integrity that has characterized our group.  Personally, I will do =
all I can, for as long as I can, to steer the group through this to the ver=
y best place possible.  Your continued dedication and support is very much =
appreciated.  Hang in there and thanks.

I am currently looking at reconciling Canada's P&L numbers for Q1 and Q2 to the ENA Earnings Estimate for Q1 & Q2 for 2001.  Could you let me know who is responsible for generating the total margin, direct & operating expenses and capital charge numbers for Canada in the ENA Earnings Estimate file?  In addition, can you please combine the Retail (Milnthorp) and Executive (Milnthorp) rows together on the Q1 and Q2 Earnings Estimate as the Retail division no longer exists in Canada?  

Thank you in advance for your assistance.

Grant

We do not have to pay the ISO the $86 million.  They will estimate what we should owe them and bill us for that amount.  They also want to make sure that we have remedied the problem.  Murray O'Neil will be the point person with the ISO.  Who will be the lead within the EES Settlements organization to ensure that we adequately remedy this problem?  That person should work with Murray to craft a response to the CAISO.  

Regard,
Tim

Tim,

GOOD NEWS!

This is the response from the ISO.  We are being requested to provide them with detail explanations behind the generation of bad meter data.

If you have any questions please let me know.

Good news.  See e-mail below.  Epstein is our Controller.  Spence is our
Director of Settlements.  Bill Regan is our Chief Financial Officer.
On another note, it has been requested that a detailed explanation be given
and what will be done to prevent this in the future.  I hope you can

Yes  Chris...we did administer a frequent flyer, V.I.P. program for them, but they  cancelled the contract with us when a "rouge" hued young man scrapped his pink,  sun burnt nose on the seat in front of him whilst flying through some  turbulence.  The giant scab resulted in several plastic surgeries and never  really healed.  Their insurance premiums went through the roof and as a  result, they cancelled our program.
 
I am  now working on a program for Canada 3000 - 1 free chiropractic adjustment  for every 15 minutes of flying time - hoping to close this one  soon!
 
Just  an FYI...

Lloyd - 

Can you work up a game plan on this technology - (costs, who could install, do we need utility approval, etc.).  I think we should present our requirements to EES, make the installation our contractual option with the customer, begin pricing the cost into each deal and get a real install done.

Also, I think we should offer to administer the data side (gathering, dissemination, load forecasting) and EES should have the customer contact/install responsibility.  

As soon as we have our hands around the IT/technical issues let's discuss and push through EES.

Thanks,
Rogers

I think we should install 15 minute metering capability and start serving these customers physically.   In order to grow this business, we need to find out if we can serve retail load directly in an efficient and cost-effective manner.   The quicker we can achieve physical delivery capability, the quicker we can define our true cost of serving these customers.

We are discussing industrial coverage with EES.  EES has proposed the following industry classifications as wholesale, ENA customer groups.  All other industrial/commercial customers would be covered by EES.  This is very similar to the approach taken several years ago.  John Lavorato wants to know if this list is too narrowly defined or if there should be exceptions.

Mining
Oil and Gas extraction
Paper Manufacturing
Chemical Manufacturing
Petroleum and Coal Manufacturing
Plastics and Rubber Products Manufacturing
Primary Metals
Fertilizer
Rail Transportation


Please respond as soon as possible or call me with questions at 503-464-3735

Regards,

Chris

As anticipated when the constraints of having  the "luck of the draw" taken out of the equation, I have moved into a first  place draw with Headley Jones in our newly formatted hockey pool. I never  once drew first pick in all previous Uncle Buzzy pools (remember him?) , so  this feels particularly sweet. With one game left, all I need is one point  from either Jason Arnott or Beretta Blake to stand alone. My only worry is a  Brodeur shut-out.
 
I offered Don Headley a split earlier when I was 7  points back, but he chose to poke fun instead. Charles, whose not even in the  pool, cried collusion, to which I explained to him that for this to be the case,  1. Discussions would have had to be held "in camera"  and 2. Others would have to be negatively impacted.  Neither of these criteria were met. I was simply being a good  capitalist.
 
Regardless, our American friends have yet to pony  in, nor has Galea ll, and I want my clams immediately! McConvey ( in  perhaps the orangiest, sweetest moment of all), please send the $20 owing  to my employer's address below, I do not want you having  access to my home address.
 
On as totally separate note, I'm beginning to now  look past when my son Yanic arrives and hold true in my very public decree that  having a child will not totally change my life. As such, we should open up  discussions on a second annual road trip, perhaps in late September? I know  Glove is very interested this year, and I'm sure Lav could be pried away from  cooking his companies books for a long week-end. We could always do Tremblant  again, but I'm in Mack's corner (for the first time ever!) in stating that I  could care less if we golf!!! Perhaps we could do Vegas, visit Lav or Glove (  which their respective wives would love) or simply go to my cottage. It doesn't  really matter, as long as we're together for a few laughs!!!!!! Air Canada is  offering $235 flights to Norfolk and Charleston, but that would obviously mean  golf, which increasingly irritates me with all its gimmicky  bullshit!!
 
So the floor is open for discussion, and knowing us  , I hope you all have enough space in your hard drive for the written  diarrhea that you're about to be assaulted with over the next month, until we  can all agree on something! Are you ready Charles? (" If he's in, I'm OUT!)".  Hey McConvey, are you going live a little outside that Weston comfort zone of  yours and spend a few shillings elsewhere?
 
Let the witchypooing begin. I'll explain that to  you later Lav.

John -

FYI.  From what I vave seen thus far I think it will be difficult getting a=
nything accurate or timely out of Evan Hughes' group.  This is the group th=
at is responsible for billing and settlements - the weakest link in our rec=
onciliation problems.  Unlike ENA Power, Retail has Deal Capture and Risk A=
nalysis under Sally Beck and the Settlements process under EES (Evan Hughes=
).  All three of these functions need to work together and feed into Wade S=
tubblefield (Wes Colwell) in order to get an accurate and timely reconcilia=
tion.  Dave has wanted to keep Billing and Settlements because of the "Cust=
omer Touch" they want to maintain.  I think this approach is delaying our g=
etting control of and resolving the issues that are keeping us from monthly=
 reconciliations and cash to actual liquidations.  I think EES needs to be =
given an ultimatum to 1) either provide us with a Settlements function that=
 allows us to flash and reconcile or 2) get out of the way.  We can provide=
 them with the bill and they can lick it.

Rogers,

I'll wait for Mike's response, but these should all be forward volume adjus=
tments as a result of truing up the volumes based on actual data received. =
 The past activity difference is captured in our potential flash to actual =
adjustment that we have pegged at a rough $75MM right now.  One of the diff=
iculties we have in reconciling flash to actual is the difference in actual=
 volumes versus volumes liquidated from the books/batch models.  With respe=
ct to how much more exists, this is one of the key items, I think, that the=
 Project Phoenix team will want to get from Evan Hughes' group to get the f=
orecasted volumes right.  My suspicion is that we need volumetric true-ups =
on many of our deals.

Again, let's verify the above with what Mike's response is.

?	Corp. VAR came in this morning at $99.8MM, up approx $10MM.  Specifically, Americas business unit VAR is at $88MM, up approx $10MM.  Six came from the gas desk and four came from the power desk, mostly East power.  

On Friday, we recognized that all desks were under their limits, leaving us the option of either temporarily lowering desks trading limits, or having the management reduce its risk.  (Lack of desk diversification, thereby limiting available VAR for yourself to trade.) 

Please let me know next steps.

Frank

Support KidSave and Help Miracles Happen. Every Summer.
 
Kidsave's  Summer Miracles Program enables orphaned children ages 5 to 11 to travel to the  US and Canada, live with families and attend day camp. The program gives  families who may be concerned about the problems of adopting an older child a chance to meet, get to know and in the best-case scenario, fall in love with a  child. The program gives prospective parents an opportunity to see and evaluate  first-hand the challenges and rewards of adopting an older  child.
 
In 1999 and  2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - 96 percent of  children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 percent of  children who participate in the program find homes easily through the program.  The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work.
 
Kidsave  believes every child deserves a family. We are committed to placing all children  who participate in the Summer Miracles Program in permanent families or  family-like environments.
 
We are looking  for families to host children, and for others who want to help us make the camp  program happen for these 250 children.   As a non-profit organization, Kidsave depends on donations to raise the  money to bring these children here and find them families.  Please call Tonya Hoppe at 281.286.8948  or tonya@tonya.cc to get involved in Houston's  Kidsave program.

where do we stand now?  last i heard was an e-mail from oxley (which is on lotus notes and not accessible anymore) which said that we don't think that we are going to get there, but hold on for a few more days while we finalize our decision and craft a really nice decline speech.  it's been a few weeks now, and i am checking status.  do you still want to offer him the initial contract?  i doubt he'd take it but i need to know.  what would you change with his proposal that would be acceptable?  i think that mike has taken this negotiation seriously and deserves a timely resolution.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
SoCal. Ed MOU Introduced as Bill
House Committee Douses Emergency Energy Relief Act

MOU Has Its Day
Sources report that California Senator Polanco has introduced the legislation today for the MOU between the Governor and SoCal Edison (SB 78XX).  As reported earlier, sources still believe that there is not sufficient legislative support for this measure to pass.  Senator Polanco's political career was earlier jeopardized by personal scandal and now sources feel his MOU sponsorship may be nothing more than a quid pro quo attempt to gain support from Davis.  Additionally, the CPUC has added two necessary MOU provisions to its next week voting agenda, though support for these issues remains weak on the CPUC board.   

House Energy Relief Efforts
The House Energy and Commerce Committee gave up plans to ease California's energy woes because Republicans and Democrats could not settle a long standing debate over price caps in the West.  Representative Waxman admitted a compromise was never more than a noble idea throughout the debates, and several delayed mark-up sessions for the bill.  Barton noted the bill had little chance of aid California considering the time it would take to pass the bill would be longer than the California summer.

Kiron,

Thank you for your note, and again I appreciate your interest in career opportunities with Enron.  

As Dawn has described below, we have made the decision to pursue other candidates for the positions we have available in both our Calgary and Houston offices.  I thank you for taking time to interview with Enron, and wish you the best of luck as you pursue other alternatives.

Regards,
Billy Lemmons

Hi Billy,

If you recall you had sent me an email at the behest
of John Lavorato.
I had met with Jan Wilson here in Toronto last week.
As far as my knowledge goes our meeting went very well.
In fact she went on to indicate that the second rounds would
be held here in Toronto prior to any rounds in the US.
The understanding that I was given both by Traci Warner,
Jan Wilson (Toronto) and Kyle Kitagawa (Calgary) was
that Jan would interview me in Toronto for the Toronto office
and that the procedure for the US would be a parallel process.

Just the day after (Wed) the interview on (Tues) I received an
an email with an ID and a PASSWORD (given below).

Further towards the end of last week someone
from the Houston office (forgot the name - the person
was a woman) called to say that I am being considered
for the Associate Program down in Houston.

Therefore I am a little puzzled to say the least with this
email that I received from Dawn Doucet in Calgary
(attached below).

I had spoken much earlier to Traci Warner in your
absence as per your suggestion. At this juncture I
feel that I should communicate with you DIRECTLY
to get a clear picture of the EXACT situation
with my application.

Please call me at (416) 538 4219 at your convenience.
I do not have your number.

Cheers

Kiron Vaghela C.A. M.B.A.

Deal Update:

Las Vegas:  Meetings and site visits scheduled with Northland, Black Hills and Allegheny.  All have registered a lot of time on Dealbench.  Northland brought there investment bankers (CIBC) to Portland and hired an independent engineering firm.  We will have the info memorandum prepared this week tosend out to other potential purchasers if necessary.  Still on track.

AMPS: We are negotiating with two industrials, each can take the first two units.  Oregon Steel in Portland and Geneva Steel in Utah.  Geneva is a better site (permitting and infrastructure).  High elevation in Utah will derate the output of the units, but will likely be able to run most hours.  Oregon interconnects with Portland General (good) but permit will restrict hours (3,500 hours estimate).  We need to talk this week to discuss the form of the contract and value/risk transfer between ENA and AMPS.

Wind:	We completed a term sale to Edwards Air Force Base consisting of shaped energy and green tags.  Tags came from our existing biomass tags and Texas wind.  We will purchase the balance from Pacificorp.  We expect more activity here with other feds, some of the munis and 6-7 developers that we are working with.

Generator Tolls: We are trading term sheets with Allegheny, Reliant, Idacorp, Dynegy, NRG and Constellation re our offer to sell at NP-15, Mid-C and Palo - I think we will get something done this quarter.

Longview: We met with the head of BPA this week and got confirmation that he supports our Longview process and that his agency will not slow us down with their proposed regional air study.  Finding EPC contractors has been difficult so we may start discussions with NEPCO.

DWR: Should execute the Master agreement this week which will allow short-term deals with 7 day payment.

John and Louise						,

I hope that the sample agreements sent to John earlier were what you had in mind.

I have completed all of the amendment and assignment agreements for those persons with the guaranteed bonus.  I will hold on to them until you are ready to fill in the blanks.  A few of those employees work for Enron Canada Corp.  I am not sure if I can transfer them to the other company in light of tax issues.  Nonetheless, those are ready, and we can change the new company name if we set up a Canadian entity in the next few days.

Let me know if you would like any more information.  You can reach me at 3-6401 or on my cell at 713-302-5522.

Michelle

John,

I surveyed the group.  In general, people are fine but we should ask for a bit more.  This should apply to US only as Milnthorp has already cut a separate deal with Janet.

EES Proposed that they own all SIC Codes EXCEPT the following:

Mining
Oil and Gas Extraction
Paper Manufacturing
Chemical Manufacturing
Petroleum and Coal Manufacturing
Plastics and Rubber Products Manufacturing
Fertilizer Industry
Rail Transportation

In our discussion with Dave, we suggested and he agreed that Primary Metals should be added

In discussions with the different regions:

ENA should add: 
Refining 
Grain Processing - Baughman and Luce
Meat Processing - Luce
Cement Manufacturing - Luce 
Auto Manufacturing - Luce, Baughman
Aerospace Manufacturing - Tycholiz, Baughman
Heavy Industrial Equipment Manufacturing (caterpillar, john deere) - Baughman
Paper Manufacturing should include - pulp, board, lumber, etc.
Glass Manufacturing - Luce ( I suspect Dave will resist this because of their Owens Corning deals)


Let me know if there is anything else I should do.

Chris

Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. 

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An "Alliance MX turret quick reference guide" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as "Caller ID" and "Voicemail Indication".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:
 
Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	
Weather Channel	12401	801	
CNN Headlines News	12402	802	
CNN Financial News	12403	803	
CNBC	12404	804	
MSNBC	12405	805	
Bloomberg	12406	806	
Financial News Network	12407	807	
CNN	12408	808	
Fox Sports	12409	809	
ESPN1	12410	810	


Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network "in-building" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible "Plug n Play" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.

Keeping an Open forum
We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com

Ray, I am not sure how this reasonable and prudent request could in any way be interpreted as a threat, and therefore do not understand.  On the contrary, to sweep the accounts without the input of the Directors of these companies threatens the individuals with substantial personal liability. Further, to simply request the agreement of the three individuals who are the Directors of these companies is not onerous, and is consistent with their good faith attempts to discharge their fiduciary obligations as Directors.  Unfortunately, these fiduciary obligations do not recognize the administrative efficiencies of Enron's cash management systems.  If this remains unsatisfactory, please let me know by return.

Peter,

Be assured that I am extremely sensitive to the issues affecting board members in Canada.  We also have similar issues in the UK.  We will endeavor to communicate as best we can.  However, all behavior with respect to your concerns must be practical in light of Enron's cash management systems.  We cannot always hold a board of directors meeting in order to effect a wire transfer.  I am choosing not to interpret your memo as some sort of threat, but as an effort to highlight a reasonable concern.

Regards,

Ray Bowen

For similar reasons, no funds are to be withdrawn in the future from any of the bank accounts of Enron Energy Services Canada Corp. or Enron Direct Canada Corp. without first obtaining the consent of Dave Delainey, Rob Milnthorp and me, who are the Directors of those two companies.

 Congrats. on the young Michael!  That must be fantastic...my fiance is from Houston and we go up to Spring periodically to visit her folks and I would love to hook up with you and the family if possible on one of those trips...yes, it is a common problem for traders - my dad eventually demoted himself back to the action - I think he said something about executive management draining the life blood from his veins?
I am spending a lot of time in Detroit on our latest acquisition...it is looking like another home run...I will attach the press release..
Congrats on all the successes!  I am glad things are so well for you... 
Best regards,

Mariner executed earlier today a gas swap at $4.43/MMBtu that results in Mariner being 85% hedged on PDP gas from June 01 to Dec. 02.  The hedged volumes where approximately 12,000/D from Jun 01 to Sept. 01 and 35,000/D from Oct. 01 to Dec 02.

The purpose of nymex on weekends is to make everybody in the industry bring up EOL every day.  There were a few days when I would get in at 7 and power traders in the industry were already trading gas either throught the broker market or on ice.  I'm trying to ensure EOL is the primary system used to trade gas.  However, it is a money loser.  If we gap down 10 cents over a weekend, I lose an average of 5 cents on 600 lots, $300,000, minus bid/offer on maybe 50 buy/sells of 30 lots times .005 is $75,000.  I don't really want to put more automatic products on the system that do little good as far as promoting EOL but are money losers. The one exception is Hub cash which I think should be a 24 hour 5 day a week product.  
 
Are the FedEx's getting to everybody Monday or are you sending them Monday?

Can you provide some more detail here. 

John, I have always been told that the East desk did not wnat to consolidate the scheduling of retail with wholesale due to all of the balancing risks associated with load like this.  I am ok with them bidding on load, but I think this is a sign that we should begin consolidating scheduling functions under wholesale - I think this would be most efficient.

I'm confused by this one. Who in ENA is bidding this stuff and did we know about the balancing.

FYI.  John, you said to smother you with e-mails so you could understand what was going on so just let me know if I am overdoing it.

Don/Rogers,

We have a situation that occurred today where ENA beat us on a retail gas deal.  I don't know how accurate our information is in this case but I wanted to pass this on to you for further consideration:

1.  Energy Gateway is a retail gas portal where users can request proposals for gas supply to Commercial and Industrial sites.

2.  EWS Gas Desk (fka EES Gas Desk) monitors and makes offers on the system where the buyers meet our requirements.

3.  Procter and Gamble requested bids today for a site inside West Ohio Gas that is supplier balanced.

4.  P&G wanted a one year deal beginning 7/2001.

5.  Load was shaped and averaged 534 MMBtu/day or 195,200 MMBtu per year.

Bottom line:  We were beat by ENA by 7 cents/MMBtu.  

I don't think we need to compete against each other and had ENA not bid we would have been the low bid at a price that was 7 cents higher.  Your thoughts?

I would like to move forward with what we are calling Phase III for EOL.  Most of the work is done but in this environment, I don't want to prepare to roll it out in January without your views.  However, if we are to roll it out in mid-January, we need to agree soon.
 
Richter has sent you the outline/presentation on e-mail and he and Savita and Jay can describe it all in greater detail if you like. 
 
Savita discussed the presentation and the plan with John Arnold and he is supportive of the rollout and the new look and functionality. 
 
Basically it will include a new home page and a new garden page, but the key parts are the expanded quotes screen and the order manager which are a much better use of real estate than the static Reuters content down the side (which will be put in a MyContent button).  This isn't expensive, most of the work is done anyway, but it is a new look and the quotes screen will now be expanded.
 
I think it would be positive to do.  It looks better, the Reuters content can be found in a MyContent button and we can use the entire quotes screen to enhance order flow and improve the counterparty experience.  It also shows business as usual with EnronOnline.
 
Your thoughts?

seems like a pretty good deal...

- $1000 transfer fee (payable by Enron)
- $331 per month dues
- free golfing for members including all family (at 3 courses...all but TPC, where there's a minimal charge)  guest charge is about $60 per round
- golf cart rental fee is $14 per person (don't need if you have your own)
- tennis is free...$10/hr for indoor
- pool access
- pay for food at restraunts.

I logged on to our pool today for the very first  time, and low and behold I'm in 2nd place (shocker) nipping on Chris Jones's  large derriere, only a few points back. What makes this race to the finish  particularly exciting is the fact that the only differentiation left  between Chris and I is that I have Jason Arnott and Rob Blake. Also, Chris has  Brodeur and I have Roy. 
 
In other words, I've got Don Hedley  shitting himself! I know he's already blown the money we entrusted  him with but that money's mine!! But, I tell you what Chris. If you respond to  me within ONE HOUR of this e-mail, I will agree to split the winnings (not  including the $20 side-bet McConvey will owe me) 50-50 with you, but only if you  agree to concede right now!!!!
 
Remember, a bird in the  hand............

Hello,

I was just dropping this note to see if anyone was interested in getting together for the Rice Owls homecoming game against Tulsa this weekend.  Game time is 2 pm and I thought we would get walk-up tickets (eveyman for himself).  If people are interested we would have a little tailgate party prior to kick-off and watch the 6-3 Owls (undefeated at home)  kill the Tulsa Hurricanes.  Drop me a line if you have interest as I am trying to get critical mass. 

Jon

PS. Please invite anyone that has interest in coming along and bring your kids if you have them.

This appears to be the extent of the damage.  I have spoke with Peoples to ensure joint cooperation on this ordeal.  Peoples is dealing with a union walk-out of their own involving over a thousand union employees.

Just a FYI...

I know there is lots going on but I would like to resign from the Board of Mariner asap. I am having trouble devoting enough time to this function and feel it would be better if I turned it over to someone else. Dave Gorte in my group would be my recommendation as a replacement. If Dave does not have an interest, Brad Larson could also fill in. Any thoughts? If you have no issues I will proceed. Thanks, Rick

For similar reasons, no funds are to be withdrawn in the future from any of the bank accounts of Enron Energy Services Canada Corp. or Enron Direct Canada Corp. without first obtaining the consent of Dave Delainey, Rob Milnthorp and me, who are the Directors of those two companies.

If you add the CTC/ Utility Credit exposure to this schedule, you will have a fair overview of the entire picture.

Subject:	Re: FYI   

Wade -

Some specific items we are currently analyzing that will have an impact on your assumptions:

TXU/North Texas Curve Adjustment    	(11.5 MM) 	This was put through on 5/17 and I am not sure made it into your summary.
NY (Rest Of  State I-CAP) Adjust 		(20.0 MM)  	Narsimha working on currently - will forward details (I doubt this was planned for)
ECAR Retail Gen Adjustments 		(07.0 MM)	Use appropriate wholesale curves and congestion adjustments
Illinois PPO 				(04.0 MM)  	Represents just one customer - J. Lewis working on potential exposure

					(42.5 MM)

Currently, we are focusing on areas that will allow us to prepare for existing "new deal" flow.  

Areas that appear light to me in your analysis include option valuations (this will probably need to be fully resolved through the Contract re-evaluation process) and charges associated with the Illinois PPO roll-off. 

Will try to keep you informed of major changes as we address them.					

Rogers

Rogers/Jay,

Attached is a copy of a reconciliation that Wes C. and John L. had asked for earlier today depicting (1) the makeup of the items included in the YTD DPR loss for WhEES (2) an estimate of the items projected to still hit in Q2 and (3) those items which we think are exposure items but which is doubtful we will have fully resolved during Q2.

Neil H. provided the data for the items included herein, all of which you are hopefully aware of.  Given the magnitude of the numbers and this point in the quarter, Wes has asked that we keep the attached updated on at least a weekly basis.  Depending on the nature of future items that come up, we may want to convene a periodic meeting to discuss the items herein with all applicable parties.

I apologize for not including you on the distribution earlier today, will make sure you are in the loop with regard to the content of the schedule going forward and will include both of you in all future correspondence.

If you see anything unusual, or know of additional items which should be include, please do not hesitate to contact Neil or I.

Thanks

Wade

John,
I'm hearing we are thinking about going to 24 hour trading. You are aware that the "machine" in crude is not profitable.  It is my understanding that crude has lost approx.$20MM on this algorithm year-to-date.   (FYI, at 11:00am it was down 132K for today's action)

For whatever it is worth, I'm a seller of this idea.  (Unless of course, someone tells me that something has changed. And if it is fixable, why haven't the crude boys fixed it?)

Frank

you should look into this.  not that there are necessarily violations, but there have to at least be questions.  i used to get a curve report that showed curve graphs on a volume bar chart.  have you looked at anything like that lately?  you can find problems with a pretty quick scan.

This person hasn't found a violation in a year.  I find that hard to believe.

Fines:

     I know you have talked with Phillip but I wanted to give my two cents.  I think the fines are a great idea. We must be accountable for VAR.  However the fines do not allow the desks to push the envelope.  The desks need to stay a couple million under VAR to protect against volatility and factor changes.  We do not have the tools to predict our VAR with any strong degree of accuracy but we are penalized for going over a few hundred thousand dollars.  I propose a one day grace period of 10% to 12% over limit.  This would allow the desks to max their VAR and protect against unexpected changes.

EOL:

We continue to have trouble with brokers not working our EOL numbers.

We believe Dynegy created a program to mirror our cash markets on their system. When we suspend, they suspend and as our markets move, so do theirs.

Steve Kean and I believe quite strongly, within a four peer group structure,  that we need to allocate somewhere between 30 and 50 percent of Gov't./ public  Affairs out of commercial support into specialized technical- there is a clear divide between individuals in the Gov't/public  Affairs groups  who are managing significant risk for the company and having a significant and  direct impact on commercial activities/ net income( these individuals should be moved to specialized technical)....and others who are performing a less strategic function( who should remain in the commercial support category). With that said, it is probably not necessary to undertake this effort for  mid-year PRC purposes since we are probably moving to a three peer stucture where that split could be achieved (for year-end purposes where the compensation impact would be felt). If we stay with the four group stucture, I intend to push hard for the remapping of Gov't Affairs by year-end.
    On a completely seperate issue, I continue to be  very concerned about the impact of the "preferred" distribution  relative to the bottom category for " commercial support" groups(I'm not implying this is'nt an issue for commercial groups- I just don't have the same ability to assess the impact there)....the concern, simply stated,  is that  it may be entirely  counterproductive to force individuals who are not performance problems  into a category that has significant implications for their careers here at Enron, particularly after going thru the past year where many of the non-performers in my group and others  were moved out of the company- the replacement costs for moving good performers out of the company for the sake of a "preferred" distribution are quite high...and that is even before you begin  to assess the incalcuable damage to morale that will invariably occour.
       Thanks.

Subject:	PEER GROUP MAPPING

Following my note last week please find attached the consolidated peer group mapping for all business units. This mapping is intended to illustrate from a functional view point where each activity was placed at Year End 2000 VP PRC.

We were considering moving to a 3 Peer Group Structure however it as agreed at the last PRC Committee Meeting  to stay with the current structure since the data had been cleaned and everyone felt generally comfortable where most activities had been placed with the exception of just  2 or 3. It was agreed that we should concentrate on resolving these rather than undertaking an organization wide remapping excercise to consolidate to 3 Peer Groups. All functions/activities within the business units should now be reflected on the acttached. 

The actions points from this excercise are:

1	to review and agree the attached mapping 

2    consider and comment on highlighted groups that we have discussed in previous PRC meetings and ask for your comments or objections to moving them 	as indicated on the attachment.

3	invite your comments or questions on any other function that you consider questionable or requiring further explanation.

      Please return your comments to David Oxley by Friday May 25.

      To have this discussion now will save lengthy discussions in the final VP/MD PRC Meetings.  Definitions of the peer groups are also attached for your ease of
      reference.

Thanks for the e-mail.  I wasn't trying to be critical of anyone specifically, and I think Dick is doing an admirable job.  I will give him high marks at PRC.  However, one position that has lost a significant amount of value since we were free to sell it is Avici.  Do you think that at PRC, this "loss" of value, which does not show up in a P/L since it is hedged by Raptor, should be taken into account when we evaluate the person?  My point is only that each of these investments are "positions" that should be "owned" by someone, like a book.  Hickerson didn't get evaluated on Avici because it didn't show up in a P/L (even though he lost a lot of value).  What do we do with Garland?  Now it has lost a lot of value again.  If Dick could sell an asset for a 10% loss today, but doesn't, and we eventually lose 30% upon disposition, how do you evaluate the performance?

With respect to North America, Dick Lydecker is liquidating most of the raptor assets.  I think he is doing a great job and showing a great deal of integrity in trying to get the best deal for Enron.  Let me know if you disagree.

Please be advised that, through the distribution of this email, Global Finance is adding the following language to the Roseville FASH dated May 9, 2001:

Add at the end of item 2: Investment terms and pricing;  Financing terms and pricing:

As indicated in the DASH, the $44.6MM represents the total amount requested for expenditures on project soft costs, as defined by accounting.  None of these dollars may be expended for hard costs, as defined by accounting, thereby preserving the ability to finance the power plant off balance sheet.  Any additional project expenditures (including commitments) which may be requested through another DASH (for turbine payments as mentioned in this DASH or any new amounts) must be incurred by a financing vehicle/structure which will allow this power project to be financed off Enron's balance sheet.

We just signed a 5 month, very small deal (1.2 MW, interruptible, R$85/MWh at busbar).

We signed 2 contracts for past transactions: Tradener/Itambe and AES-Sul.

Good Morning! 
Bottom line: No Changes - Overall US conditions will return to a more normal late fall/early winter pattern (no Arctic air) over the next 2 days. This pattern will persist through the end of the month. 
For the near term (1-5): Bottom Line - Cooler weather will bring temperatures below normal from the beginning through the middle of the week in the Midwest and from the middle through the end of the week in the East and South. The below normal event will last 3 to 4 days before normal temperatures return. The Rockies and West will be normal to above normal with cooling by the end of the week.
Details: We see some cool anomalies arriving into the Midwest tomorrow, with temperatures in Chicago reaching highs late tonight and the mercury falling through the day tomorrow. By Tuesday, the South and Texas will be in the below normal category, with Dallas overnights in the mid-30s (normal low 43), Houston's low 40s (normal upper-40s) and Chicago will freeze, with a mid-20 overnight. Progressing into the Northeast by wednesday, Philly and New York will get into the below normal category, but 5 or 6 degree anomalies are most likely. Looks like a three day event as it moves easterly and then is followed by moderation.
6-10 Day Bottom Line: Variable conditions continue with a stormy pattern entrenched over much of the nation. Overall temperatures will be normal to cool with very wet conditions. NO strong Arctic air is expected.
Details: A strong storm will push into the West late next week and next weekend bringing heavy rain and snow and temperatures near to below normal. At the same time - the Midwest will warm toward normal with wet conditions developing. By early in the last week of November the strong western storm will push into the central U.S. bringing widespread rain and snow. Behind the system another surge of below normal temperatures will track from the Midwest to the South to the East.
11-15 Day a generally cool and wet weather pattern will persist over much of the nation. While NO Arctic air is clear on the horizon - temperatures on a national average will be cooler than normal and there will be an increased threat for rain and snow. 
So, with normals dropping across the nation, this first cool air anomaly event arriving in the Midwest by Tuesday will elevate the nation's gas demand requirements into the 60 Bcf/d plus regime from here on through the winter. Here's the strip beginning with today:
Sun 	11/18 	47 Bcfd 
Mon 	11/19 	54 Bcfd 
Tue 	11/20 	67 Bcfd 
Wed 	11/21 	69 Bcfd 
Thu 	11/22 	65 Bcfd 
Fri 	11/23 	62 Bcfd 
Sat 	11/24 	61 Bcfd 
Sun 	11/25 	62 Bcfd 
Mon 	11/26 	64 Bcfd 
Tue 	11/27 	63 Bcfd 
Till tomorrow, 
The Weather Team

On Thursday, May 17th, senior executives with Woodside Petroleum Australian=
 headquarters will be in Enron's offices to discuss their company and explo=
re possible opportunities with Enron.  Woodside is the largest E&P company =
in Australia.   Enron was approached a couple of weeks ago by Woodside's Ho=
uston representatives regarding acquisition of oil and gas assets currently=
 managed by ECR.  They also requested a meeting at a senior level to discus=
s other opportunities as well since their Australian execs were visiting Ho=
uston this week.  The agenda below was developed with input from Woodside's=
 Houston representatives.  Woodside is interested in spending $1B on domest=
ic US acquisitions.  They are also a large player in the LNG and natural ga=
s markets in Australia. It appears that there are several areas where Enron=
 and Woodside could interact.  Enron has attempted to do some LNG business =
with Woodside recently.  They do not seem to be fully aware of Enron's dome=
stic or its global presence.  A goal of this meeting is to address this unf=
amiliarity.  I have attached briefing materials on Woodside for your review=
.  Hard copies of these materials are available upon request.  Special than=
ks to David Mims for his input.  If there are any other Enron personnel tha=
t should meet with Woodside on Thursday, please let me know.  Also please c=
irculate this email to anyone that should be advised of this meeting or cou=
ld benefit from the materials.

                            Agenda - May 17th

2:00 - 3:00        Macro Discussion on US Domestic Gas Markets  -      Juli=
e Gomez
3:00 - 3:30        Enron's Market Presence and Global Areas of Focus -  Gre=
g Whalley
3:30 - 4:00=09LNG Discussion -                                             =
         Les Webber, Kurt Lindahl
4:00 - 4:15        Trading Floor Tour
4:15 - 5:00        ECR Asset Discussion -                                  =

The location for the meetings will be in conference room EB 3335.  Please g=
ive me a call if I can answer any questions.
Thanks for your help,
Scott Josey

Gents,

I thought that I would let you know that Rob Hemstock informed me last night that Murray Smith (Minister of Energy) got the PPA Division Regulation through Cabinet yesterday.  This essentially allows us to split the PPA with the remaining steps being a formality.  The Sundance B PPA will become the Sundance B3 and Sundance B4 PPAs within the next week.

This works.  I think it is what Dynegy is looking for.  It allows set off of swaps OTM to Dynegy against the Sithe cash flows Enron owes Dynegy.  

We need to make sure we don't default on trading agreements otherwise it brings down the Sithe payments owed.

If they agree to discounting at Prime + 2% it reduces our liability in the books.

the framework re the sithe letter:
1.added cross default to master netting agreement.
2.added acceleration of ena's payment obligations in the event of default by enron parties under the master and close-out by the dynegy parties.
3.added set off right to dynegy parties if they end up owing under the master to the remaining payment obligations of ena.

re the master netting agreement which you will send:
1. added cross default to ena's payment obligations under the sithe letter.
2. added set off right to dynegy parties like in 3. above.

John -

What are your thought s on location of EES' Gas desk - current head count = 47.  FYI, we just assigned Jim Homco to this group to address commercial and operational issues.

Is there any space on 6 with ENA's Gas desk?  We have had discussions lately re: the many areas where potential integration efficiencies could be achieved, such as having a retail fixed price rep sit on Lagrosta's desk to achieve more timely and accurate prices for non-swap products.

We could fit the group on 5, but the functional benefit just isn't there.

Also, does Sally Beck's group provide the confirms/contract/risk services for ENA's gas desk as it does for ENA Power?  If so, shouldn't Sally be involved in retail?  These guys are really behind in this respect and it is a big factor in ongoing losses and commercial imperfections.

Joh/Kevin

I am sorry, but I cannot believe what I read below.  

Arch of Chicago - multiply by EXPECTED number of accounts??????
Suiza - How do we measure milk production, we cannot even manage energy consumption - Got Milk?????
Packaged Ice - ??? I hope we don't have any ice facilities in California.

Conclusion - I do not expect that we will do any more deals like this anytime soon.

To:	Rogers Herndon/HOU/ECT@ECT

Subject:	RE: P&L Impact of Volumetric True-Up

The brief synopsis on causality of the losses are as follows:

Arch of Chicago

The deal was originally priced (in 1998) with one account and the results were multiplied by the expected number of accounts.  We have re-priced the deal with actual volumes from our billing system (to capture all active volumes).

Suiza

The revenue is based on a production index (gallons of milk).  We have updated the revenue from the Consumption Desk and re-priced costs with data from our billing database.  In addition, we have worked with the Account Manager to segregate pass-through vs. active volumes.

Packaged Ice

The revenue is based on a production index (bags of ice).  We have updated the revenue with data from the Account Manager and the Consumption Desk.  We have also re-priced costs with data from the our billing system.

Conclusion

The losses are amalgamation of structured vs. actual volume differences, production index revision and initial modelling error.


If I can be of further assistance to you, I can be reached at 3-1902.

Thank you.

Best regards,

Mike Kim

Michael -

Are these changes in the forward volumes (unrealized losses).  Can you explain the reason for these adjustments?  How much more exists that we need to address?

All:
Yes, I've made John, Kevin and Tim aware of where we are with the missing positions.  However, on the daily report, I would like it documented-- the number of batches which are still outside of the report, by counterparty.  That way, we have a status of how much information is still missing.  I've committed by 9 November we can resolve these difficulties with the current position reporting.

Thanks,
Dale

Scott

Please see the link to the latest P&L report.

I spoke with Dale. He has made senior management aware of the issue of missing positions from the report and hence he suggests that we can go ahead and include the URM figures in the DPR.

We have shown the summary position by East and West region, which I believe is the level of detail to be included in the DPR. The underlying details by NERC region and utility are for Rogers and Dales use. (We will probably reformat the detail reports).

I would like to bring your attention to the timing of the reports in terms of URM and commodity curve dates.

Please let me know if this suits your requirements.


Thanks

So, like we were saying earlier, there is less gas flowing North around the horn at Stanfield. The outage schedule is as follow: Pine River is back on June 12, and Fort Nelson starts on June 14 until June 27 (280mmcf), then 290 mmcf off on June 29 at McMahon. If prices are not motivated to move to Malin, it will back off in Alberta, either through Gordondale, or displacing gas at Kingsgate. 

The story for the other small storage facilities on Northwest Pipeline is:
	We were told that Mist is approximately 25% full, but it has a capacity of only 9 bcf   
	Plymouth has approximately has a capacity of less than 3 bcf.

Clay is taking its gas from the Rockies. We think there is enough supply to offset any additional capacity from Sumas, so Canadian gas should not be used for injection in Clay. Clay is already about 3 bcf over last year (23.7 bcf vs 20.9 bcf, on a capacity of 54.5 bcf. Last year they were only 83% full).


I hope this helps. If you have any other question, don't hesitate to give me a call at 6721.

I regret to announce that Sean Crandall has tendered his resignation from Enron.  He has decided to return to his native land of Utah to join Duke Energy's trading team.  Sean made tremendous contributions to our trading floor during the past few years.  He will be sorely missed.  Please join me in wishing Sean the best in his future endeavors.

Louise,

Please find attached the attached update of all potential transactions and relevant P&L associated with Upstream Products and BHLP.

Quick updates by group :

Storage : I am having a phone call with Dave Neubauer, V.P. ETS, to discuss Northern's monetization of their gas.  In addition, Skadden Arps because of their workload associated with representating El Paso in California has delayed our meeting for another two weeks.  I have expressed my extreme displeasure and am seeking other appropriate legal firms who are well versed in regulatory affairs to advise us on the our storage monetization structure.  Paul continues to get very positive feedback from clients.  We can not move forward without addressing the regulatory risk related to our financing structure.  Steffes is aware of my frustration.
Compression -  Moving forward on pricing from EES. Oakhill and Baygas still look promising to close this quarter.  Chris met with Duke and after the meeting, decided that Baygas could not be closed until third quarter.  Received an email from Goodpasture that cc'd Prentiss - have not had time to address it.  Will do so tomorrow.
Wellhead Desk - moved to 32. P&L is lower due to "system issues" between TAGG and Sitara for the booking of some wellhead transactions.
Ecommerce -  had a successful meeting with Apache.  Still waiting on the Andex VPP to close.  Thompson has been on vacation or has been sick.
Production Offshore -  I am continuing to work with Tom to reallocate employees and associated responsibilities.  I have not received any word from John regarding who will take on the P&L responsibility associated with MEGS/Pluto.  In my mind, it should be under Allan Keel, ECR, since he is working on the restructure/sale of Mariner. Tom will inform me tomorrow of his decision to stay within ENA or to go to EGM.

I also met with the Origination Regional heads (Luce, Vickers and Tycholiz) and shared with them a modified version of the "Hot List Update" worksheet.  I am trying to work with them to develop joint product / general origination opportunities.  I have not been given any feedback regarding the deals or customers listed.

An update on Bridgeline :

Randy Curry visited with me this past week.  He would like to hire some individuals into Bridgeline and it is his understanding that the "Board resolved" to hire new employees through Enron's benefit plan.  I do not like this type of exposure for the company.  Enron takes on all the benefit and hiring risk, but does not manage the human capital.  In my mind, Randy has dragged his feet on implementing a benefits plan and hiring appropriate human resources.  In addition, I am extremely annoyed that he will not sign the Compensation Plan because it nullifies his Texaco contract.  Randy gets the best of both worlds - to be a Bridgeline or Texaco employee contingent on the situation.

I have tried contacting Robyn Davis, Texaco board member, and we have been playing phone tag.  In addition, I have met with Jeanie Slone and am meeting with David Oxley tomorrow to discuss the overall BHLP situation.

Regards, Mrha

Do we have a QBR scheduled for June?  It won't hurt my feeling if we don't.   :-)

John,

Managing VAR limits is essential and P&L Penalties are a great way to achieve this.  However, we need to find a way to impliment this method while minimizing negative side effects such as: (1) discouraging aggressive trading; and (2) significant morale reductions caused by penalties which do not fit the crime.

I still disagree with the $1 Million fine for such a minor violation of our VAR limit.  The punishment does not fit the crime. What message are you trying to send?  The message being received is that we should trade less aggressively and leave several million dollars of headroom at all times.  Also locations such as Socal, Malin and PG&E should be avoided due to limited liquidity and potential volatility spikes.  I know these are not your intended messages.  

I realize you have given the west desk significant leeway in the last few months regarding VAR.  We have been making excellent progress towards VAR reduction in an environment in which the VAR calculation and tolerance are constantly changing.   My suggestion for implementing a VAR control system that provides for penalties but gives traders room to probe for maximum VAR utilization is a warning for minor breaches (<$500,000) and penalties for violation of two or more consecutive days or initial violations greater than $500,000.  The amount of the penalties should be documented in advance and should increase with the amount of the violation.

Please consider these suggestions.  We want to play by the rules, but the rules need to be fair and known in advance.  Also, we are willing to accept these policy revisions retroactively and forget about the $1 million from this morning.

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL

I wanted to highlight my preliminary thoughts.  I suggest we get together so I can get a feel for where you want to go.

Objectives:

Primary objective is to avoid repayment of the principal Lenders prior to at least January 1, 2002.

Secondary objectives are (a) to avoid the Lenders being able to declare a default resulting in on-balance sheet treatment, and (ii) securing firm replacement financing from OPIC, but without risking the availability of the OPIC financing caused by a delay in Completion (I do not have good feel for this aspect of the matter yet, and need to pursue it with Ranabir Dutt when he returns from meeting with OPIC).

Primary Issues:

1.	Under the Construction Agency Agreement (CAA) can we (ESAT) state definitively that there will not be Completion before 	01/01/02?
2.	Is the current running of the Project, for commissioning and testing, risking an argument that there has been Completion?
3.	Can Completion be deferred without the Lenders declaring a default (Agent Event of Default) under the CAA , resulting in 	balance sheet obligations?

Other Issues:

4.	Can the timing of the availability of the OPIC financing be delayed to accommodate a deferral of Completion, without risking 	the firmness or availability of the OPIC financing, particularly in current capital markets?
5.	Are lost energy/capacity payments/revenues from deferring Completion a material commercial consideration?

The following deals only with items 1 -3.  As mentioned, I need to get a better feel for the OPIC side of things, and item 5 is a commercial matter.

Outside Payment Date:

As I understand it, the repayment obligation occurs upon the earlier of:

	(a)	Final Completion (as certified by ESAT) under the EPC Contract; or
	(b)	an Agent Event of Default; or
	(c)	the Maturity Date - August 31, 2002.

Alternative #1:  Deferring the activities of the EPC Contractor, including to stopping current testing operations, to ensure Completion does not occur this year.

The risk is the Lenders declaring an Agent Event of Default. This will also put some risk on the Lenders, however, for improperly declaring an Agent Event of Default for any of our resulting losses, noting:

(a)  Completion arguably means (although not entirely clear) Final Completion under the EPC Contract, requiring (i) Facility Substantial Completion (we need to confirm where we are on that); (ii) completion of the final punchlist; (iii) completion of all NEPCO clean-up and final documentation obligations; (iv) NEPCO receiving all releases and lien waivers (knowing the lien release requirements and timing are under applicable law is fundamental); and (iv) NEPCO satisfying all warranty and other obligations under the EPC Contract.  It is fundamental to determine if Final Completion is even a reality before year-end?

(b)  It is ESAT that certifies when Completion occurs.

(c)  Although there are obligations within the Scope of Authority under the CAA to take all Required Actions (Completion within the Budget and the Plans and Specifications) there is some scope or leeway for ESAT to unilaterally amend the Plans and Specifications, and thereby affect the timing for Completion, provided Completion occurs before August 31, 2001.  It may be too late  

(d)  An Agent Event of Default is subject to a 10-day curing period after notice.

(e)  The Termination Payment is due within a further 10 days after notice.

Alternative #2:  Deferring the process is not necessary.

The risk is that we may be moving the Project closer to Completion in the current year and/or an interpretation that the Project is in fact Complete, noting:

(a)  The definition of Completion under the CAA does not necessarily require Final Completion or even Facility Substantial Completion under the EPC Contract.  The test is more vague, and could be to a lower standard.  Noting this difference, and understanding the mood of the Lenders is fundamental. 

(b)  There is an obligation on ESAT to take the Required Actions under the CAA for Completion, as well as potential good faith obligations.      

(c)  The Project is currently operating (although as noted, apparently for testing and commissioning purposes).

(b)  We may still run the risk, in any event, of the Lenders declaring an Agent Event of Default.

Other Items to Consider:

The concepts of the Start Date and Commercial Operations under the Consortium Agreement do not seem to be relevant.

Last week, I spoke with Sally and asked her to kick off curve validations respective to all desks.  I emphasized that curve accuracy is particularly important.  Although probabilities exist that Dynegy will mark book down, I think it would be wise that this process not be a deal buster.  Do you want me to communicate this to desk heads?

John,

I have made the following suggestions/comments to Remi, pending your agreement.

- Brazil VaR looks low ($0.6 MM) - apparently we are using Argentina vol curves instead of Brazil vol curves.
- Book a diesel position for 15 days out of the year when we expect Ecogas to exercise their option and cut us. This will be a rather small short position and Remi will not hedge it at this time.
- Electrobolt: upon completion of construction (7/01?), treat the power plants similar to Modesto Maranzana and New Albany for management purposes, pending resolution of accounting issues.
- Modesto Maranzana positions have been booked (long power and short gas). We will firm-up the P&L in the next few days and book it as well.

Vlady.

John, In an effort to make sure we were covering all the bases, I assigned one of our associates the responsibility of monitoring Energy Gateway for potential RFP's to industrials listed on that portal. We have subsequently done a few transactions on the portal.The trade with Procter&Gamble is one of those trades. I didn't realize that EES was also viewing the portal and submitting proposals. Now that I/we realize that fact, I will handle accordingly. I spoke to Jess Hewitt @ EES and we will co-ordinate our offers going forward. If you have any further questions, please let me know.

To follow up our conversations, I met with the Brett Wiggs, Ranabir Dutt and others today, and have made the following clear:

1.  Brett Wiggs is to document and implement a process for completion of the project under the CAA that legitimizes that the project cannot be completed to the standard required by the required actions of the Construction Agency Agreement until the new year.

2.  Ranabir Dutt is to ensure that it is made clear in any communications with the project lenders that completion to the standard required by the CAA is not going to be achieved this year.

3.  Ranabir Dutt is to ensure that the financing from OPIC requires some completion risk or requires a standard of completion lower than what is required for the project lenders under the CAA with all other conditions to funding by OPIC to be otherwise satisfied before completion is a possibility under the CAA.

The objective is to ensure that completion and funding risk is "hedged" between the project lenders and OPIC, or, if OPIC flakes, to ensure that we can legitimately state to the project lenders that completion will not occur until the new year.

A couple of additional points:

1.  I told them not to worry about getting to a start date under the off-take agreement to achieve upside from capacity payments this year as it risked the project lenders being able to legitimatize completion this year without OPIC being fully committed.

2.  There is nothing preventing the project lenders from asserting that completion has occurred or declaring a default for non-payment this year.  However, I told them that we need to do the right things so that the lenders will face risk of wrongfully attempting to seek repayment if they do so.

They all seem to get the message.  I will follow up with them tomorrow.

Peter.

Subject:	FW: Highlights from this morning's ENE/DYN analyst conference call

This was forwarded to me this morning.  Someone's notes from the call.

Listened in on the analyst call this morning.  Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order.

The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  

Specific points:
EES will be a part of the new company.  
Enron assets will be revalued at closing.  
The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  
Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%.
Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  
ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  
Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  
In what was termed a "new approach", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  
Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.  
Lay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'.
All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.
Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure.
Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  
Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.
Dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there.
Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash.  
Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.
Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.
With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.
ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  
BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.
McMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.
Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won't be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.
Watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model (uh-oh).  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.
Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger.
Watson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. 
The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron's assets or businesses.  Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.
McMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements.
ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.
The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.
Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.
Initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities.  
McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.
Dynegy's earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.
Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.
ChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'.  (No further clarification given).
Whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the Enron traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.'
Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.
Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.

Give me a call if you'd like me to try to clarify any of these comments.

Please plan on attending a meeting at 10am Thursday morning June 7 to follow-up on our previous discussions regarding the EES contract reviews.  The goal will be to discuss everyone's progress to date and exchange feedback on the Contract Database, along with discussing the broader goals and process of completing review of the entire contract list.  

As you may have seen from the latest Project Status Report the contracts have been proiritized in an attempt to focus our efforts on the higher impact relationships.  We should begin to establish timelines for these agreements and discuss expectations for the deliverable product.

I will follow-up with the location of the meeting but wanted to go ahead and reserve the time with everyone.

One more.

- Washington Gas: EES has parental guaranty. Due to current financial status, Washington Gas has requested Bond instead. RAC contact indicated no bond available - EES has 30 days to respond.

A note on the Con-Ed - Services/Operations has a work around for the few Mid-market deals origination is closing which will prevent us from increasing our security (Straight Dual Billing). Mass Market volume increase will drive any security increase in this market.

Thanks,
Rebecca

... and just to be clear, here are the recent or current issues I am aware of and their status:

Con Ed, request for $1 million security in lieu of parental guaranty:  complete.  $1 million sent prior to 11/14 deadline.  Request for additional security likely to come when Con Ed sees our increasing load.
SoCal Gas, request for margin sharing agreement in lieu of parental guaranty:  complete.  New contract signed and delivered 11/16.  Retail and wholesale gas desks to work together to avoid occurence of margin call for credit over $5 million daily.
Peoples Gas of IL, request for letter of credit for $40k in lieu of parental guaranty:  deferred.  Peoples agreed to suspend demand for l/c if further downgrade does not occur.
Virginia license for EES gas:  complete, for now.  Services served copy of application to other parties.  Their comments due back to VA SCC by Dec 7.
Maryland license for EEMC gas:  scheduled to be approved on provisional basis today.  MD PSC will be reviewing generic requirement that parental guarantees be unconditional, unlimited, and unrestricted.
Pennsylvania, request for update to EES and EPMI bonds and request for increase in EES bond from $250k to $3.8m:  Under review.  New bond language has been sent to Mary Grisaffi.  Trying to whittle down (or eliminate) increase.
CG&E, request for deposit associated with Transmission Service Agreement:  being processed.  Service request reduced from 100 MW to 25 MW to reduce cash outlay.
First Energy, requested new security in lieu of parental guaranty.  deferred.  First Energy agreed to continue accepting parental guaranty in absence of further downgrade.

If there are others we should know about, please let me know.

After talking with Dan, I intend to set up a meeting to provide complete matrices on licensing and utility contracts sometime early during the week beginning Dec 3.  

Also, just to make sure everyone is clear, Harry, Gloria, and Rebecca are on point during the next few weeks to ensure that that EES and/or EPMI responds timely to any request for info, additional security, or other utility matters.  This, of course, will continue to require help from legal, credit, and operations.

If anyone has any other questions, please give me a call.

Thanks.

Dan --

I will get with Evan and his team and pull this together.  Of course, much of the activity with Utilities is driven by their requirements and judgements (which change over time).

Jim / Evan - 

As you are probably aware, the performance and surety bond market is difficult for us to navigate in and around in our current situation.  As an example, EFS has been shut out of getting access to new bid and performance / payments bonds for its business that requires these.  We are addressing this with the bonding companies now.  All of their existing bonds are in place and in force.

In light of this, I wanted to make sure that we are absolutely current in all aspects of all bonding requirements with UDC's and LDC's.

Please send me the most current copy of your matrix that illustrates where we have existing bonds in place, what drives the capacity requirements, status, renewal / expiration date, current payment status, etc.  I would like to make sure that we are all clear on how these work, what triggers increases / decreases in capacity, and other issues impacting our ability to continue to flow electricity and natural gas to our clients.

Thanks - Dan

David Port should be contacting you shortly. We are in a major revamp of the policy and limits etc. Has to be submitted for next Board Meeting. I don't think there is appetite for increasing overall risk in Enron (corp var) so the allocation becomes critical. Should be an interesting discussion. More to come. Rick

I have a concern about Enron's forward-looking exposure associated with legacy deals (deals that existed during the June 2000 through the May 2001 price shock).  If Edison gets its way, all customers will pay for Edison's under-recovery from June 2000 through January 2001 plus CDWR spot market purchases during 2001.  This would take the form of a surcharge on future bills.  My concern is that Enron will be on the hook for these future charges associated with past under-collections -- even beyond the term of our legacy deals.  For example, if a deal ends in March 2002 we could be on the hook for surcharges that a legacy customer would receive on its bill after that date, provided the surcharge pertained to costs incurred by the utility during the time that the legacy customer was ours.

I have not received clear guidance from legal on this matter.  For example, I asked both Mike Smith and Steve Hall to review the legacy Safeway contract which is on PGES paper.  They both indicated that there is a better chance than not that we are on the hook for these charges, although good arguments could be made that we should not be responsible for them.  Angela Schwarz indicated to me that outside counsel (I'm not sure who) thinks that we are not on the hook for these charges.

It is critical that we get clear guidance from legal on these risks.  We are in front of customers now deciding whether or not to go forward with extensions or terminate contracts after the initial term.  Customers are asking us to make changes to our "change in law" and "utility non-performance" provisions.  If we believe that we are wearing the surcharge risks beyond the term of the existing contract and the customer is willing to take those from us in exchange for changes to the master agreement we would probably be willing to do it.  If we aren't currently wearing surcharge risk beyond the term of the existing contract then our negotiating position would be different.

As you all know, the magnitude of this risk is potentially large as our negative CTC receivable is in the hundreds of millions of dollars.  If the CPUC were to adopt Edison's proposal for the entire state, EES' customers would be responsible for surcharges of the same magnitude.  At this point, I don't know whether EES or its customers are on the hook for this risk beyond the term of existing contracts.



Vicki -- could you forward this message to Mike Smith.  I couldn't tell which Mike Smith to send it to.

John, we are confirmed with both the Premier's office and Lay for the 19th of June. I assume that you will be attending also. What are your thoughts on who should attend the Harris meeting and what other meetings should we set up to maximize the use of yours/Lay's time.

Brian Purchase is a key decision maker in Wilson's office. My thought was that you could meet with Wilson and Purchase. Aleck believes that it would be beneficial for Lay to meet with them also.

Rob, we have Lay from about 1 pm to 6 pm.  The question is how to make the best use of his time.   After the Premier, I think  meeting Wilson and Purchase is  the best use of his time.  It is really Purchase I want Lay to meet, and it would be hard for Lay to meet Purchase without including Wilson (assuming of course he is available).  They will be among the key decision makers going forward.   If you have any other suggestions about how to make the best use of Lay's time here, please let me know.

Lay is confirmed for the 19th.  We have him from one  to about  six.   Once I have the Premier's meeting tied down re time, I am going to try to arrange a meeting for Lay and Lavo with  Wilson and Purchase.  I think that is the best use of his time.  Let me know if you have any other or different ideas.

Several questions I would like more information on so that we can figure ou=
t how to return our residential customers to utility service:

1)  Vicki - can someone on your staff pull a copy of what we have sent cust=
omers describing our commitment to them?  Or what did they sign and send ba=
ck to us? =20
I am interested in the pricing and the terms of the deal. =20

2)  Evan - is it possible to get a copy of a bill that we send to a residen=
tial customer just to see what one looks like.
Evan - can you also tell me if there is anything difficult for the resident=
ial customers in being switched back?  What should they expect to see?  Wil=
l their bill be messed up for a while?  Are there procedural things that ne=
ed to change?  How long does it take?  What might the new bill look like? =
=20

3)  Lamar - could you have someone validate the position we have in the boo=
k (PV volume and dollar exposure - pre and post rate increase)

4)  Peggy / Beth - can we meet and brainstorm how to communicate our "good =
bye" to these customers.  One idea:  perhaps we could ask Devon to help us =
send residential customers a letter showing them 100 ways to reduce their e=
nergy bill by changing their behavior or spending less than $100 at Home De=
pot on energy conservation enablers.  Then, as part of our good by, we coul=
d send them a $100 gift certificate to Home Depot.  This, along with a clea=
r communication on what to expect in their billing cycle and what they migh=
t expect from the utility.  - our message might be?: " we have always been =
able to price differently than the utility, but due to market conditions we=
 really aren't going to be able to maintain that "pricing advantage" that y=
ou have enjoyed for the last several years.  Since our company is based on =
helping our customers create extra value, and since we can't find any extra=
 value, we will be moving you back to utility service.  As we go, don't let=
 it be said that we aren't always thinking about creating extra value, so h=
ere are 100 ideas and a $100 dollar certificate to home depot.  Just implem=
enenting 10 of these ideas could reduce your energy bill by 25%.  In the en=
d, lower the overall cost of energy is what it is all about.  As we get new=
 ideas, we'll be in touch....."
Just an example...but something like that....

5)  Carol:  could you schedule a meeting for us to review this stuff say Tu=
esday? =20

Please email ideas or comments prior to the meeting.  Vicki, if we have the=
 info from #1, I am not sure you or an associate need to attend.  I think E=
van, someone from project Golden Bear, Peggy and/or Beth, and Evan. =20

Thanks all.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Of the four "Plan Bs" introduced recently by California legislature, only two proposals appear viable for SoCal, and surprisingly, PG&E.  The others either establish vulture funds for when So Cal goes under, or propose new ways of funding the transmission line deal.  The California legislature's inability to identify an immediate solution has cued the media to limit the publicity of the lesser "plan Bs."
At this point, SoCal is interested in a making a deal.  Not only are they are the on the verge of bankruptcy, but (unlike PG&E) SoCal has also significantly exposed its parent company to bankruptcy by not taking the necessary steps to protect its assets.  As reported earlier with PG&E, we are monitoring all activities surrounding SoCal assets, which could signal imminent bankruptcy.

The Infamous "Plan B"
Four hours of debate and the absence of Republican representation on Tuesday night led members of the state Assembly's so-called "Plan B" group to decide backing only legislation introduced by Assemblymen Dean Florez and Joe Nation.  A previous proposal by Senate President Pro Tem John Burton that poised the state to purchase SoCal's transmission lines for $2.76B to service debt and left the Ca. PUC to determine SoCal's unrecovered power costs prior to bond issuance, didn't't win support.  As reported earlier, sources indicate that Davis MOU is likely to suffer a similar fate once introduced by Senator Polanco later this week. 

The Florez Plan
Florez's plan is currently under review in the Assembly Energy Committee.  The proposal allows PG&E to issue bonds secured by their assets and use the revenues to pay creditors.  The state would then assess a tax on the bond revenues aimed at servicing PG&E's debt with the CADWR.  Sources report one drawback to the plan is that PG&E bankruptcy Judge Montali would be required to authorize any such a transaction respective of other recommendations available to the court.  This may not be the most time-efficient course of action.  PG&E had shown signs of approval over similar plans in the months preceding their bankruptcy.  

The Nation Plan
Nation's plan allows SoCal. Ed to sell bonds backed by ratepayer revenues generated from state approved rate hikes.  Additionally, the state would hold a five-year option on buying the transmissions lines for book value (roughly $1.2B), as well as holding to the SoCal concessions previously mentioned in Davis' MOU.  The drawback to Nation's proposal is that SoCal creditors (including banks and generators) would have to collectively agree to take debt repayment at $0.75 on the dollar.  Sources report that some SoCal creditors favor attempts to recoup dollar for dollar in bankruptcy court over conceding to a "haircut."  SoCal. reportedly approves of Nation's plan sticking to the principals outlined in Davis' MOU.

To assist with the external evaluation I have grouped all the external people together, that way the designated itnerview team is focused solely on non-enron people.

On Wednesday we will be having a mini Trading Track interview session.  The quality may not resemble the first session we had but I thought it would be worth it if we can find a couple more folks to put in the program.  We will probably have a much bigger one later in the year after the new analysts and associates join.  I had a couple of observations from last time.

1.  I think we were too hard on external candidates.  There are 5 or 6 external candidates.  Remember that they don't have the Enron grounding that the internal candidates have.  Most of them are not in the Gas or Electricity industry.  Try to evaluate them on their intrinsic qualities.

2.  Some people have not thought about trading concepts and are unfamiliar with trading lingo.  That doesn't mean that they will not be good traders one day. I think we were a little biased based on someones ability to run a stack tommorrow.  

Regards

John

  Set for June Completion<br>
  Bush's National Energy Policy Promotes Use of Biodiesel</b></font></p>
<p>ONTARIO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 19, 2001--Southern States Power Company,
  Inc. (OTCBB:<a href="http://www.stock-quotes.com/clienttools/quotes.asp?ticker=SSPC&exchange=OBB&link=CB0529&textcolortop=FFFFFF&tblbgcolor=FFFFFF&width=450&colorall=FOFOFO&chartbgcolor=FFFFFF&color=CB0529&bgcolor=WHITE&fontsizetop=4&chart=YES&showquote=YES&background=none">SSPC</a>
  - news) announced Saturday that the company's Coachella Valley Biodiesel Production
  Facility is near completion and scheduled to begin producing fuel on June 11,
  2001. The final stages of construction are ongoing, and photographs of the facility
  have been posted on the company's website, <a href="http://www.sspowerco.com">www.sspowerco.com</a>.
  The addition of biodiesel from the Coachella facility will allow the company
  to fulfill the growing number of orders it is receiving for its OXyG Biodiesel
  Fuel, including the most recent to supply backup power to the University of
  California, Riverside. Southern States Power Company is receiving increased
  national exposure in the wake of the newly released National Energy Policy which
  emphasizes the further development of alternative fuels. </p>
<p>The Coachella Valley Biodiesel Production Facility is designed to initially
  produce 10 million gallons of fuel annually, with plans to expand capacity in
  the future. Southern States Power Company is currently providing biodiesel fuel
  to a growing number of clients, including Deer Valley Unified School District,
  the largest school district in Arizona and Rockland Materials, a cement company
  with a fleet of over 100 trucks. The contract to supply biodiesel to the University
  of California, Riverside marks Southern States Power Company's entry into stationary
  power generation, a market that is rapidly expanding in California and other
  areas of the United States. As Southern States Power Company signs more biodiesel
  contracts, the company anticipates building production plants across the country
  to meet an increasing demand. </p>
<p>In the new National Energy Policy unveiled by President George W. Bush last
  week, the emphasis placed on more widespread use of alternative fuels, such
  as biodiesel, has created even greater interest in Southern States Power Company's
  OXyG Biodiesel Blend. The Report of the National Energy Policy Development Group
  includes several recommendations regarding cleaner, renewable fuels which will
  tap the vast potential for biodiesel in the generation of electricity and to
  power a wide variety of motor vehicles. </p>
<p>Lawrence W. Taggart, President and CEO of Southern States Power Company commented,
  ``The Coachella Valley Production Facility represents a significant step forward
  in the growth of the company. This is just the first of a number of facilities
  that Southern States Power Company plans to build. It is heartening to see the
  federal government recognizing the importance that alternative fuel, particularly
  biodiesel, will play in the energy future of the United States.'' </p>
<p><b>The Company </b></p>
<p>The primary focus of Southern States Power Company, Inc. is to develop, produce
  and distribute alternative fuels, particularly biofuel, for use by consumers
  and commercial businesses. While the demand for alternative fuels is great,
  there are few producers ready to meet the growing need. </p>
<p>There are nearly 27 billion gallons of diesel consumed annually in the United
  States alone, and an additional volume is consumed internationally. It is the
  goal of the United States Department of Energy that 30% of petroleum based motor
  fuel be replaced by alternative fuels by the year 2010. Federal and state fleets
  are mandated to use up to 75% domestically produced alternative fuels. </p>
<p>Southern States Power is poised to capture a significant portion of the rapidly
  expanding biodiesel market through an aggressive marketing plan as well as contacts
  in government, business and industry. Tightening clean air standards and growing
  fossil fuel costs are forcing private commercial fleets to look toward alternative
  fuel products. Major biodiesel initiatives have been passed in Arizona, Ohio,
  New Jersey, Nevada, Delaware and Iowa. More information can be found at the
  company's website: <a href="http://www.sspowerco.com">www.sspowerco.com</a>.

Tim - 

Thank you for the follow up.

I suggest that Evan Hughes work with Murray to sort through the appropriate process check points (CSC, settlements, EPMI) and to respond to the CAISO.


Thanks - Dan

Subject:	kWh to MWh problem Resolved!


We do not have to pay the ISO the $86 million.  They will estimate what we should owe them and bill us for that amount.  They also want to make sure that we have remedied the problem.  Murray O'Neil will be the point person with the ISO.  Who will be the lead within the EES Settlements organization to ensure that we adequately remedy this problem?  That person should work with Murray to craft a response to the CAISO.  

Regard,
Tim

Tim,

GOOD NEWS!

This is the response from the ISO.  We are being requested to provide them with detail explanations behind the generation of bad meter data.

If you have any questions please let me know.

Thanks - MO

Good news.  See e-mail below.  Epstein is our Controller.  Spence is our
Director of Settlements.  Bill Regan is our Chief Financial Officer.
On another note, it has been requested that a detailed explanation be given
and what will be done to prevent this in the future.  I hope you can
understand the reasoning for this request.

This is bizzare.  Global Markets promised Jean this money and won't seem to write her a check.  It was also a low number relative to what was created for GM.

John -

Global Markets is maintaining that there are "accounting issues"  with the $1.25 million.  Should we get Faith Killen or Wes to get this wrapped up?

Good Morning!

The overall pattern looks unchanged from our views as of Friday.

EarthSat has a similar view.

If you would like to set-up some time to review what facts exist regarding billing and settlements in EES please give me a call.  I think you and I getting together would make a lot of sense.   

We (the Services Group) have a great deal that is being rebuilt/improved but at the same time have a lot that is currently working and we are making progress on many fronts.  

Anthony D. and his team will get us closer to where we need to be once our technology issues are addressed.  In the mean time -- we need to continue finding better ways to cobble our legacy systems together.  

Bottom line -- your note is misleading...see the red and next time -- before you launch something like this -- please ask someone who is accountable for the topic you decide to discredit.  I don't think we can grow a business together by tearing down others.

I can be reached at Ext. 53311 or on my mobile at (713) 444-3125.

Thanks and talk with you soon,

Evan

Evan,

I give a risk update to Rodgers and Don today.  We deviated a little bit and I gave them a high level summary of billing
and settlements (as Rodgers paraphrased below).

You might want to setup a meeting with Rodgers to bring him up to speed.  Unfortunately I won't be around.

I could be on the phone if you want.

Regards,

John -

The current functional reporting structure of Billing & Settlement's through EES poses near term and long term tactical risks we  feel jeopardizes our ability to meet our goals and objectives.

Currently, Deal Capture and Risk Analysis/Reporting report through Sally Beck.  However, Settlements and Billing report through Evan Hughes (EES).  As such, the reconciliation process (Wes Colwell and Wade Stubblefield) is held hostage to any piece that breaks down.  In this structure we (ENA) are able to control the progress and performance of Deal Capture and Risk Reporting.  We are making progress on these fronts.  We are completely out of the loop re: current state of affairs on the billing side (other than it just doesn't work).  We are also out of the loop in assuring the proper approach and solutions are being  implemented.  

According to Anthony Dayao and other, there are approximately 11 different billing systems that feed CSC (we outsource billing to CSC apparently).  Billing Group spent several months attempting to scope out the process and future requirements.  This was done in conjunction with Union Finosa.  I think that approximately $6.8 MM has been spent to date on this effort w/ Union Finosa (Anthony, is this accurate).  Union Fin recently provided the group with a proposal and Anthony has negotiated 60 - 90 days to review and respond (Apparently, Billing wanted to go forward with just one week of comments).  Bottom Line:  this does not appear to be the proper approach to ensuring that we are solving our comprehensive billing/settlement issues as well as near term necessities.

PROPOSED SOLUTION:
Billing/Settlements should report to Sally Beck (dotted lines to ENA and EES)
EES can maintain customer interface through call centers and logo on invoice
Convene an immediate meeting with Evan Hughes, Anthony Dayao et. al. to summarize current state (including Union Fenosa)
Retain Accenture or KPMG to fully scope out current reality vs. business needs
Implement action plan to address long term solution vs short term necessity.

Until we can resolve this, I am afraid that 1) decisions are being made without full consideration of ENA's view of business needs and 2) ENA cannot be accountable for when and if we can ever provide monthly reconciliations and flash to actuals.  As we all recognize, unless you can reconcile the books, you really don't have a legitimate business.

John, could we convene a meeting if necessary for you to address these issues.  I will be out next week and would like to leave knowing that we are on the path to getting this resolved.

Thanks,
Rogers

IntercontinentalExchange is pleased to announce  that weather swaps trading will be included in its new version 8 release. These  fixed-for-floating financial products will be cash settled on a five-day average  temperature, Monday - Friday, for the current week and for the forward week.  Temperatures used for the settlement of these products will be those reported  by EarthSat, a widely recognized and independent source of weather data. Settlement  temperatures provided by EarthSat will be available via the IntercontinentalExchange  website.

The standard contract size for all locations will  be $10,000 per degree Fahrenheit, with a tic increment of 0.1 degree Fahrenheit  or $1,000. There are no payout limits on the contracts. 
The design and development of these new weather  products was done under the guidance of Aquila Energy Marketing Corp., a recognized  leader in weather product concepts.

Everyone -

We will be kicking off the referenced project beginning 10:00 am Tuesday, May 21 in Room 3143B.   Sorry for such short notice - we will have a follow-up for those who are unable to attend.

Berney and Vlady will provide a list of contracts, a template for risk assessment and an overview of what work has already been done and what lies ahead.  This project is one of the cornerstone's of determining our current positions and risk profile as well as influencing strategic systems requirements.

Thanks for everyone's help in this effort,

Rogers Herndon

Dan Staines and Joe Conner focus on Wholesale activities, you can work this out with Rick/Jim. I'm fine with the rest.

Subject:	RE: Govt Affairs Org Chart

Janet -

1.	The best split is probably just 50/50 on personnel.  While everyone is in a specific box on the org chart, many if not all of the people are flexible enough that they can cover different roles.  The $ on outside services may be able to be split differently going forward (for example, if EES wants something specific on a state PUC matter).
2.	In terms of approving outside service expenditures, I would like to sit down with you, Louise, and Rick to work out what the best method of working through the approvals.  I will try and set up some time the first week of December.
4.	I have put Steve Montovano in the NE Gas box.  This will increase the budget by $400k (based on historical figures).  I have attached a new org chart to represent this change.

Also, Dan Staines (who is not on the Org Chart) has an Employment contract that ends 6/12/2002.  Dan has been working on Florida and Northeast RTO matters and continues to help East Power with the NYISO TCC auction.  We can sever him, but his contract will need to be paid off ($87k).  Govt Affairs also has a contract for support with Joe Connor (ex-Southern exec) to support our SE activities.  I am trying to get a copy of the contract, but I think that it is in place until 8/02.  My recommendation is to use these guys through their contracts instead of a large payment today.    

Thanks,

Jim

EES is fine with the Org. chart below. I understand the $6.4 million is total for both ENA & EES. Comments:

1.) Need a recommended split of the $6.4 million for ENA/EES.
2.) I understand the $6.4 million includes $0 for Outside Services. The OOC of ENA/EES needs to approve as these services are needed.
3.) The $6.4 million does include legacy real estate costs. Jim Fallon is the coordination point on our real estate costs-is this on his radar screen?
4.) We need to reconcile what we do with Steve Montovano. Because both ENA/EES want to utilize him, I might suggest leaving him in the regulatory group so that both groups can effectively utilize him. Louise/Jim- are you both OK with this? If so, Rick/Jim, I would suggest putting him in the NE Gas Box.
5.) Rick, I understand you're talking with Kean/Whalley on handling the Washington office activity in Corp. I agree.

Janet --

Here is the org chart that captures our discussions.  I think that this org and the # of people is the lowest level that can even try to meet the combined needs of ENA and EES.

Total headcount = 21.  The personnel cost = $6.4 MM (total for ENA and EES).    

Please let me know if you have any questions.

John:  There is a conflict of interest in Thompson having all the info and selling to a group formed by him and other employees.  We need to talk this through.  Maybe, he should take a leave of absence.  Should Jesus negotiate the deal for ENA?  Selling to employees is sensitive now.  Mark

Prepared in contemplation of litigation -  Attorney Client Privilege

There appears to be no succinct way to write down my thoughts on where we are with El Paso but I'm going to try.  

Assumption:
Kilgore's objective:		Maintain PRM accounting treatment for the swap.
Outcome of lawsuit:	 	Game Over for Kilgore if his accountants disagree with the current PRM treatment and move it to debt thus affecting his 					ratios and revolver.

What do we want?
(i) 	To be certain of payment - how important is this really?  Pretty important - but what is this worth is cash terms.  We clearly are in a position 		whereby if El Paso evers transfers the contract to an entity which defaults on payment we are exposed.  However,  realistically what are the chances 	of them defaulting - very low and, would we win that in court - Yes.
(ii) 	To monetize the contract - secondary concern with a value to Enron of $15m.  There are potential ways that we could monetize the contracts 		without disclosing the contract - Joe is working on these.    If there is a way we can do this then our downside from this confidentiality issue is much 		smaller as it would cost us more to monetize (thereby bringing in less gain - probably not much of a difference) but can we get the asset off the book? 	We are pursuing how far we can get  in terms of 'true sale' treatment with V&E - they will give Joe a view on Wednesday.  There are potential other 		ways we can ensure this is off our credit.

If we sue them?  Loss of leverage.
We potentially open up the issue to a much wider audience and potentially affect Kilgore's accounting treatment - the one thing he wants.  So our leverage has disappeared as we are no longer able to maintain the one thing Kilgore is looking for.

Way Forward:
We should continue to pursue a commercial solution to the payment issue and monetize the contract through a secondary route.  If we complete monetization through another route then we are exposed to non-payment which could be perceived as very low risk (we have potentially a one year exposure on the back end based on six years statute of limitations).  If we cannot get a way forward on the monetization , then re-review the way forward. We are at risk of them suing us over the confidentiality breach and that would be in New York.  

Good Luck!

reasonable.  He and I have always been able to work out differences of

Louise,

Please find the attached update of all potential transactions and relevant P&L associated with Upstream Products/ BHLP.  If you have any questions, please contact me at work (x31931) or on my mobile  (713-302-4187).  

Quick updates by group :

Storage - We have been working a great deal with Regulatory affairs to assess and get over the regulatory risk associated with the monetization structure.  We (Steffes / myself) are having a conference call with Skadden Arps this coming Monday.  (Skadden Arps was the firm that wrote the opinion letter to Northern indemifying the pipeline of regulatory risk from the monetization of their pad gas.)  If you wish, I have a presentation delivered to Skadden regarding our proposed structure that I could forward to you.
Compression - Getting prices is still an issue.  Aucoin and et. al, have moved to six and we have dedicated a resource (John Kiani - who rotated through EES underwriting and understands EES' batch models) to help facilitate pricing.  Upstream Products has received most of the origination expected from Phase I, Formosa.  I left a voice message (in addition to the prior emails) with Goodpasture to negotiate origination between ECF and ENA for the storage deal Hilgert/Bilberry negotiated on their behalf.
Wellhead desk - is moving to 32, next to natural gas structuring, in order to be closer to logistics and have recorded phone lines for OTC transactions.  There have been many issues with our internal systems as well as logistics that are too numerous too mention.  Let us suffice to say, it has been a long two weeks.
Ecommerce - I think that the Andex VPP and outsourcing deal will close next week.  I have proposed a pricing structure to Phil Ballard and hopefully, Thompson will concur.  He is on vacation, but Ballard thought it was very reasonable.
Production Offshore - I am working with Tom to dismantle the group and associated responsibilities.

Regards, Mrha

Hello John -

We met a couple of weekends ago when I stopped by to ask you about the power plant in the photo on your wall. (..You also mentioned that you're a big Mario Lemieux fan.)

I'm writing because I'd actually like to invite you to lunch sometime. I have lunch with my stepfather, Bob Mosbacher, quite frequently downtown here at the Houston Club and it would be fun to invite you sometime. I know Dad M really enjoys meeting younger people here in the energy business and it'd would be fun for me to introduce you.

We are having lunch today at 12 Noon and while today is probably too late notice for you, 
you are invited anytime.

Regards,
Bobby

Disegard previous e-mail.
We  reached a conceptual agreement with the government representatives on Sunday night.  The main points are:  

     1. Rationing losses:   Defined methodology giving distribution companies recovery over the next 36 months of rationing losses realised   from June 01 until the end of rationing in 02. Recovery includes financial compensation. Immediate funding of 80% through BNDES, with Brazilian government funds. Loans liquidated over the 3 year period as tariff increases are realised.  Funding scheduled by December 15th.  Elektro Ebitda impact of approximately R$163 million or US$ 63 million. Corrected numbers in second email

       2.  April/May MAE settlement :   Market will settle under current rules due to pre-rationing conditions, confirming the procedures used on Elektro's books.  Impact of approximately R$ 18 million or US$ 7 million. 

       3.  Parcel  "A" for the future:  All non-controlable costs to which LDC's are subjected to including power purchases, sector charges, are passed through to final tariffs either using a tracking account mechanism or by aligning adjustment dates with  the LDC tariff revision date.  Tracking account will be subject to financial compensation from the date costs are incurred until the effective pass through and collection , eliminating a major risk for the distribution sector. Elektro Ebitda impact  2002 forward of R$ 60 million or US$ 19 million, as had been considered in the 2002 plan.  This methodology represents major risk mitigation going forward, as the initial power supply contracts are renewed starting in 2003.

        4. Parcel A from the past:   Min Parente has agreed to the concept recovering non controllable  that were not passed through to tariffs since late 1999 using the same methodology agreed to for future recoveries and has a dedicated team from the Federal Attorney General's office targeting a final solution in ten days.    Elektro impact  is R$145 million or US$ 55 million in 2001. The proposed mechanism for recovery is after the 36 months for the rationing losses.  

We are currently finalising a memo of understanding and the government team is winding up the settlement with the generators in order to finalize the terms of the overall agreement.

Min Parente has committed to resolving the open issues affecting investors in the power sector.  These  agreements represent a major step forward, significantly improving  the value of our businesses. By  solving the pending issues for the rationing losses, thus eliminating the Annex 5 controversy the MAE should function normally, allowing us to operate Eletrobolt and settle against the pool.  

Total amounts for the sector represent about R$ 10 billion or US$3.8 billion at the current rates.  Our team has led the sector negotiations for months since the rationing, and have been instrumental in convincing the government of the need for implementing these changes.

TD Waterhouse is now accepting Conditional Offers to purchase shares of
Willis Group Holdings Limited which is expected to price on 6/11/01.

To read the preliminary prospectus filed with the SEC and place a
Conditional Offer, follow these steps:
*	Login to your account
*	Click on Trading > IPO Center > IPO Offerings

In the list of Current Offerings, select the offering you want and then
click on the "Continue" button.

Important Information - Reaffirming Your Conditional Offer

Once the registration statement is declared effective by the SEC, we will
contact you via e-mail to notify you of the effectiveness of the
registration statement and the price as determined by the managing
underwriter.  This normally occurs on the day prior to the first day of
trading.

If you still wish to participate, you will be required to respond to us by
3:00 am ET of the following business day to reaffirm your previously
submitted Conditional Offer.  Please note that the e-mail notification will
likely be sent after the market closes. Please ensure that you have provided
an e-mail address that you are able to access after that time.  You may
change your e-mail address at anytime via the "Update E-mail" function
within the IPO Center.

If it is not possible to check your e-mail after market hours, you may
reaffirm your Conditional Offer following effectiveness by going to the
"IPO Order Status" within the IPO Center, choosing the Conditional Offer you
want to reaffirm, and clicking "Reaffirm Conditional Offer".

If you fail to reaffirm your Conditional Offer within the specified period,
your Conditional Offer will automatically be cancelled.

Conditional Offers are accepted once reaffirmed, at the offering price,
determined by the managing underwriter after the registration statement
becomes effective.

Please note that reaffirming a Conditional Offer does not guarantee an
allocation of shares.

Thank you,

TD Waterhouse Investor Services, Inc.
Member NYSE, SIPC.

Gentlemen -

We have had a last minute meeting confirmed with AEP in Columbus for tomorrow to discuss physical delivery to retail customers in their service territory.  We are specifically trying to negotiate an energy balancing service and load aggregation/forecasting.  As such, I will not be in tomorrow and will miss the site profile meeting.  Malik is on point, ready to go, and knows where I stand re: direction and expectations so feel free to meet and educate John on the process.  If you would like to reschedule, we could meet on Monday as Mallik is out on Friday.

Sorry for the late notice.

Rogers

Today, we received a letter from FERC notifying us that they are initiating an inquiry to increase "their understanding of the scope and development of electronic trading in electric power and natural gas markets."   FERC is requesting that EnronOnline "cooperate" with the inquiry.  The letter states that they will be sending us a request for information, and visiting our offices in Houston.  

We're not certain what FERC is after with this inquiry, but wanted to make sure you were aware of this development.   We are looking into this, and will get back to you asap with further information.

Below is a brief summary of the BC election results and some analysis into the new political party's' implication.  As the new BC energy strategy further develops, we will provide a more detailed follow-up reports.  

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
New Democratic Party sweeps election
Opposition within newly elected party possible
Campbell to consider dividing BC Energy and Mines portfolio

NDP Election
As expected, the NDP was "wiped out" by the Liberal Party.  At this point, the Liberals have secured 74 of 79 "ridings" (a "riding" is the BC terminology for an open seat), while the NDP has won only three.  Counting has not yet been completed in another riding, though it is expected to go to the Liberals, as well.  The final riding, in Victoria, is disputed due to approximately 700 absentee ballots.  The NDP is currently trailing the Liberals by 50 votes.  This dispute is not expected to be resolved until 29 May, when all absentee ballots will be counted.  No other parties secured seats, though sources report that the Greens acted as a "spoiler" for the NDP in several cases.

Opposition Party
Sources speculate that it is possible that, due to the poor showing by the NDP, a new Opposition might form within the ranks of the Liberals.  Approximately five former members of the Social Credit Party (which was disbanded in the early 1990s) were elected to Liberal seats.  Sources state that it is possible that these members could re-form the Social Credit Party within the legislature to act as an Opposition to the Liberal government.  Sources also state that Richard Neufeld, as a former Reform Party member, might choose to join this Opposition if it forms, though there is no read at this time as to how likely this is to occur.  Otherwise, due to the landslide, Campbell's Liberal government is expected to have a "carte blanche" to do whatever it wants.

Minister of Energy & Mines
Campbell is expected to focus on forming his cabinet first.  There reportedly is a considerable pay gap between the cabinet and the "backbenchers" (MLAs), meaning that there is likely to be "considerable jockeying" for positions.  However, there are 6-10 obvious contenders, including Richard Neufeld, who is likely to be named energy minister.  Sources report that Campbell intends to reduce the size of the cabinet somewhat, though the size of the reduction is not known at this time.  However, he reportedly may be planning to split the energy and mines portfolio off from northern development, forming two separate positions.  It is also possible that energy and mines could be combined with other positions to form a larger natural resources portfolio.

John,

We have spoken with several online investment banks.  One of them, WitCapital, has lead an IPO in the past.  The others only co-manage IPOs.  Wit claims to have refined is business to focus on co-managing IPOs, rather act the primary distributor of securities.  In addition, Wit has increased its sales personnel, so that less of the stock distributed to its customers is purely over the internet.  

I have asked Wit to give me the parameters (e.g., size, costs, primary versus secondary shares, etc.) by which they would lead an IPO distributed solely over the internet.  I am still waiting for this information.

The online investment banks appear to have a place in IPO distribution, but it is not as a primary distributor of shock.  I will get back to you when I hear from Wit.

Regards,

Kyle Kettler

don't know about the relationship with dave,  you'll have to work on that one.

i will talk to stan, but i can't believe he has any interest in developing power plants anywhere.

Portland General did just get a dash approved for building about 45 mw in oregon.  Stan Horton called me about it, and he was going to have someone in Portland (i'll remember the name in a minute)  call tim belden about our fundamental analysis of the region.
Stan also mentioned the there is an unregulated side of PGE that is enterring into these transactions.  He wondered if that part of PGE should belong in EWS.  Talk to tim and we'll decide how to approach that next week.

John,

I hate to whine, but...

EES:
Duran and I talked with Delainey yesterday.  It seems as though we are setting up one centralized trading/risk function but we will have overlapping origination functions.  I am sure I can work with whatever arrangement you make with Dave, but it seems as though we will be tripping over each other in the market.  Industrial coverage seems easy, but they want to call on IOU's and Munis in order to buy customers.  These are fundamentally large, structured short positions that are very similar to what we have been and are pitching.  

Transport/Operations:  
Eric Gadd came back from London and reports to Stan Horton.  He heads up an Asset Development group that is focusing on, among other things, power plant development in the southwest.  This sounds crazy - do you want to call Stan or should I?

Portland General:
They are developing generation in Oregon that is competing with one of our projects.  No one in RAC has heard of this yet.  Not a big deal, I will call Peggy Fowler, but thought you should be aware.

Regards,

Chris

Jean/ John -

It looks like they have fixed their "problems"  and we should be getting our money through accounting tonight.

Can you make sure that Carol is talking to Greg Whiting in Gas Accounting?

Thanks

There are no accounting issues.  I am assuming that Nowlan is retrading the deal.  I will set up a meeting with Wes.

Global Markets is maintaining that there are "accounting issues"  with the $1.25 million.  Should we get Faith Killen or Wes to get this wrapped up?

 Organization Announcement (Correction) 

I apologize for the confusion and inconvenience my mistake caused.  I had indicated that Kenneth Lovejoy would be supporting EES, but this is not correct.  Ken will be supporting  OEC.  Corrected announcement is provided below. 

 It is my pleasure to announce that Kenneth Lovejoy has joined Enron Corp. EH&S Asset Operations.  He will be reporting directly to Donnie Willmann and  will support Central America, Caribbean and OEC.  Ken has over 25 year experience in environmental, health and safety for the oil and gas industry.   He has been working for Enron since 1996 and has extensive international experience.    We are excited to have Ken in our team so, please welcome Ken in his new role.

In a move due to shock a few of you - I announced late last week that I'll
be leaving Kraft after almost 12 years.  I cannot say how excited I am - yet
torn since I've had such a terrific time at Kraft.  So - what now?  I'll be
with Kraft for another 3 weeks and then looking to chase some dreams.  This
is a great time for me personally and for the businesses I was running - so
here goes.

Specifically, I am looking at things that leverage my love for (1) consumer
marketing (2) operations and logistics management (3) ability to lead from a
general management role ... as you'll see in the attached file:
	 <<ASW Pyramid.ppt>>

I wish I could have shared sooner - but really could not - so I'll be
reaching for many of you to discuss some ideas I've got and looking to
network, specifically into:
*	VC/Equity Firms/Investment Bankers that own/specialize in $10-100 or
150 Million companies
*	People you know that have moved onto the small company world and
might be helpful for me to chat with
*	Anyone you might know in the adventure travel or skiing worlds

Hope that's OK.


Separately, I promised an update of the 4Q lists.  Here they are.  Let me
know if something if not up to date.
	 <<Four Quarters - May 2001.xls>>

Still looking for email information for Jose Arenzana, Kerry Bradford, Rock
Chen, Tim Coleman, Rob Davis, Brad DeSoto, Jennifer Guerrero, Amy Justice
Irvine, Scott Muschany, Karl Safft, Brad Wilsted, and Dave Zawalski.  Not
bad - only missing 11 after all these years.


Lastly, you'll note that I updated my contact information.  As of May 31st,
contact me at home email:
	Address:		1634 N. Larrabee
				Chicago, IL  60614
	Phone: 		(312) 337-9085
	Fax:		(312) 337-9086

Dear Mr. Lavorato,

I received your contact details from Dave Delainey and he suggested that we
speak regarding this initiative. I am compiling a report entitled The Impact
of Competition with PricewaterhouseCoopers Energy Practice that examines
business solutions within the utilities sector. Essentially, the report is
designed to inform senior executives with energy management responsibility
throughout the private sector on how to enhance their effectiveness. The
project is in its second phase and you can see round one on the associated
web-site, www.utilitiesproject.com.

I would like to schedule a call with you, so we can speak about this
initiative and your potential involvement. Thank you for your time and I
look forward to hearing from you.


Kind regards,


Martin Grealis

Jim Steffes forwarded to Janet late Monday the recommended organization and budget($ 6.4 million total for both companies). Jim should be the primary point of contact on both the budget and Gov't Affairs organization for ENA/EES( I'll address remainder of issues with Whalley, kean, and Fallon). As an aside, it's possible the $6.4 million could be reduced somewhat as we begin to mitigate legacy real estate issues and also  consider locating the Houston-based staff in the above-referenced organization in available space with the business unit(s). Thanks.

Donnie/Kristin/Scott/Narsimha

Origination has instructed us to unwind this deal due to a Material Adverse Change clause tied to our Credit Rating.  The contract has been reviewed and we will dispute their interpretation.  In any event, we should unwind effective immediately.  Please show me what the unwind value is 1) at our mids and 2) at our bids.  We typically unwind at bids but given the circumstances and size of the exposure I may make an exception.  I anticipate an unwind loss in the amount of -$4.5 -  -$5.0 MM.  The negative unwind value is a result of credit clauses/non-uniform contract provision and, as such, should be passed back to Origination.  I would expect Origination to handle any futher pass-through to Credit directly with Credit.  I have made Origination/Legal aware of our cost pass-through. 

Thanks for your help,
Rogers

John, Peter Krenkle (NGX) called me yesterday and advised me that our technical guys are telling him that we can be ready for July 1. We had agreed to give the industry 30 days notice prior to implementation which means we would need to send out a notice today or tomorrow.  I want to make sure that we are extremely confidant that we can get this done in 30 days. Given our last discussion and talking to Zipper re the real-time issue, I'm confused on why our position has changed from being a huge issue to a "7-day fix". 

Please advise asap.

John:

We executed the transmission connection contract with Light (local distribution company) yesterday for the project.  Based on completing this agreement and our conversation, we are moving forward with the shipment of the turbines.  Initial loading of loose items will start this afternoon and turbines tomorrow with a planned departure of the ship on Sunday.  Let me know if you have any questions or comments?

Thanks,
Brett

In rereading your email from 11/1/01, whether Enron is the survivor of the merger makes no difference, as long as, if it's not the survivor, the survivor assumes the obligations.  Nothing seems to be triggered in the provisions described, as long as (1) the survivor has equal or better or investment-grade credit, which we assume will be the case, (2) the deal is done with approval of the Enron board, which has occurred, and (3) Enron survives or the survivor assumes, which would be case if we switch to a structure in which Enron does not survive.

Does any of the recipients disagree?

Michael -

Are these changes in the forward volumes (unrealized losses).  Can you explain the reason for these adjustments?  How much more exists that we need to address?

Thanks,
Rogers

There will be a press conference by the Assembly Republicans at 10:30 a.m. PDT to announce their counter-proposal to the MOU.  This should give further insight and generate market reaction as to whether SoCal can be saved.  The Republicans are almost certain to offer something less generous that the original Davis transmission line offer.

The first quarter of 2001 was a record quarter for the performance of the businesses under the Enron Global Markets group.  We posted a gross margin number of $100 million for the first quarter.  This represents a 38% increase in gross margin after a very successful Q1 of 2000.  When combined with outstanding results posted in December of 2000, EGM has contributed over $187 million to the Wholesale group in the last 4 months.  This was due to tremendous contributions from each business group.

In order to keep the momentum going and to facilitate more growth, the following changes and additions have been made within the organization. 

Crude and Products group
Mid-marketing
Bill Berkeland has joined the group and is responsible for creating a focused mid-marketing function specifically within this group.  Fred Lagrasta is responsible for mid-marketing for Enron Americas and still maintains some responsibility for various contacts and deal flow as well.  The purpose of this group is to be very focused in the development of crude and product specific products and services.  This group reports to Randy Maffett.  

Origination
In order to manage the increased origination opportunities around the world, the Origination group has been changed in order to insure that the proper focus is placed on these opportunities and to manage its wide scope.  Doug Friedman will lead our NGL and Petchem origination efforts reporting to John Nowlan.  Joining Doug will be Rick Cantrell recently hired from Union Carbide.  The global crude and products origination group has added Randy O'Conner from Red Meteor, who has extensive experience in these markets.  Both Randy and Doug Leach's growing fuels origination group will report to Randy Maffett. 

Trading
Lee Jackson will assume the role of U.S. NGL's lead financial trader, supported by Chad South.  The petchem and plastic trading businesses have been reorganized under Stuart Bland.  Alan Engberg will be responsible for plastics trading in the Americas.  

Shipping
Scott Moncrieff will assume responsibility of our global shipping network related to crude and products.  Scott will be charged with expanding all aspects of the shipping portfolio taking advantage of our growing presence in these markets and the successes we have had marketing shipping on line.

Weather
The weather group under Mark Tawney's direction is expanding its efforts around the world.  Europe will have an expanded focus and the London office will focus on new opportunities in Europe.  Paul Murray has joined Enron from Castlebridge Partners and will be moving to London to develop and expand the continental opportunities.  Ross McIntyre, currently based in London, will report to Paul.  Bill Windle has joined the weather group and has responsibility for origination activities for North America.  Bill's most recent assignment has been in the EBS organization.  The Oslo weather office managed by Thor Lien will have responsibility for Scandinavia weather activities.  In addition, employees are being added in the Australia and Japan regions.  We are now making markets in 32 cities around the world on EnronOnline.  

Coal
Mark Schroeder has joined the coal group and is responsible for origination activities with generators in the U.S.  Mark's most recent assignment was as the head of all regulatory activities for Enron Europe, Japan and Australia.

Enron Japan
The momentum of power deregulation process has slowed in Japan.  The decision has been made to scale back the wholesale power activities.   Joe Hirl, President and CEO of Enron Japan, will now report into the EGM organization.  Joe will maintain his direct responsibility of the office and will be increasing his focus on the business lines within EGM.  All of these products have high growth potential in both the near and long-term and he will coordinate and help implement with all the business lines and their activities.

LNG
LNG continues to expand with the vision to increase the number of transactions and create a portfolio of assets and contractual access around the world.  Jonathan Whitehead has joined the LNG group and has responsibility for all trading and shipping activities.

Neal Gerstandt, previously an independent energy consultant,  Jared Kaiser, from Enron Americas - East Gas Desk, and Kurt Lindahl, from Enron Global Assets, have also joined the LNG group with responsibilities in the area of origination in the Western Region.

Enron Freight Markets
EFM has concluded over 2,000 transactions in its first two months.  Chris Kravas continues to focus on building the spot trading and mid-market capabilities that will enable it to be the dominant player in its market, and has hired four new traders in the last two weeks.  Kellie Metcalf, from EBS, has joined Shawn Cumberland's origination effort, and Deirdre McCaffrey, from Gas Structuring and Mid-Market, has joined Matt Arnold's forward trading group focusing on diesel products.  

Global Risk Markets
David Hoog joined Enron from Ace Insurance in December 2000 and has quickly built a team of people specialized in trading unit contingent power price call options, a hybrid insurance derivative product. Drawing on Ace and Enron resources, this team is based in New York and includes Alex Tartakovski and Larry Marcus from Ace, as well as Joana Bekerman and Tony Chang who recently moved to New York from Houston. Their first transaction closed just 3 months after startup.

Brad Blesie will be moving to London in June to establish a base of operation for GRM and expand our insurance derivative activities into the European market place. Among the opportunities he is currently exploring are contingent call options applied to shipping and charter rates, trading insolvent insurance claims, and combining North Sea oil and gas VPP risk with decommissioning insurance.

In April this year, EGM established a hedge fund origination effort in New York reporting to Per Sekse and led by Russell Dyk who recently moved to New York from LNG in Houston. Russell is responsible for expanding our commodity trading relationship with hedge funds to include crude oil, products, liquids and other commodities traded by EGM. Joining Russell in this effort is Stephen Plauche, who comes to us from Enron Americas' power trading desk.

Financial Trading
Elsa Piekielniak has assumed responsibility for Enron's developing agriculture business.  Billy Lemmons has changed groups and now runs the Analyst and Associate program for Enron Corp.  

Please congratulate everyone on their new assignment and we look forward to the continued growth in all the EGM businesses.

John,

I feel that the people needed to manage the portfolio under a services
agreement are Jesus Melendrez, Craig Fox (engineering), Arvel Martin
(operations), and Joe Joyce (land).  Greg Smith (Geophysics) may also be
needed for a period of time to manage through Bonne Terre and Cypress.  Some
analytical support may also be required (John House and/or Brian Otis) -
Jesus would need to make that call.

Scott

Gentlemen:

FYI.  We are at the present time fully hedged on the 80,290 share long position with an offsetting short position at an average price of approximately $86 per share.  By my calculations, the mark for the quarter from March will be approximately $3MM to the positive.

That's one of the topics I wanted to address PRIORITARILY this afternoon.  According to Luis Otavio and Fred, customers A (alta tens?o, and demand greater than 2.5MW) will ONLY be allowed to sell "excess power" not consumed (capped at their "cota" or "meta" or quota) to OTHERS CONSUMERS, but not to MARKETERS.  The reason for this is that ANEEL/Parente don't want to "flood" MAE with positions to settle (the argument is, if MAE cannot manage 67 counterparties, they won't be able to manage several hundreds).  But it's crazy: all unbalanced (net) positions will be settled in spot market: if marketers are not allowed to act as intermediaries, there will be hundreds of net, bilateral positions to settle (and it WILL flood MAE), if marketers like Enron can be in the middle they will net themselves all positions on portfolio basis and they will show only ONE position in MAE.

This mechanism is no different from the often discussed concept of DEMAND SIDE MANAGEMENT.  The only way to make it work is to allow LIQUIDITY and therefore competition and therefore Marketers. 

It is vital that Marketers be authorized to acquire and sell this power, and settle their net position (net position only) in spot market.  EOL will be a great tool for this, and we may accelerate its launch in Brazil with this new, different product ("Restricted Power")

Subject:	mae measures

One of the proposals under review with the Apag?o team is to allow the B and A costumers to access the Mae and transact their "contracted energy" after their respective 20-25% reduction targets.  The MAE and the distributors do not have the systems in place to deal  with over 1,800,000 customers in the entire system. Elektro alone has close to 150000 customers in this class.    This can be a tremendous oportunity for Enron on Line to take off.  Remi could you review and prepare an action plan urgently.  These measures are targeted to be released next week.

Republican Plan B
A source reports the following regarding the Republican Plan B proposal:
Encourage direct access for consumers.  (The problem with this, however, is that these direct access deals would not have a dedicated rate component, and too many might undermine the cash flow and credit worthiness of the bonds.)
The Republicans will "suggest" that generators take a 30% haircut.  "We think this is doable."
The Republicans strongly oppose purchasing the transmission assets.
Restore the invetor-owned utility model for generation.  They would establish a dedicated rate component for construction of native generation by the utilities.  They would grant ratepayers equity interest in these plants.
Resolve the QFs' financial issues.

Assemblyman Cox commented afterward that the Republcans have been trying to work on a bilateral basis with the Democrats on these issues, but they feel "frozen out."  Moreover, he senses the Democrats moving back toward having an option to purchase SoCal's transmission assets, which the Republicans oppose.

Democratic Plan B
A source reports the following regarding the Democratic Plan B:
The Democrats are formulating a Plan B that incorporates the Governor's MOU, the Nation Plan B and other ideas that they have.  This plan reportedly has not yet been introduced into the legislature yet because it is still being finalized and the Democrats are not certain that it will work.  Specifically, the option to purchase SoCal's transmission assets is reportedly still being debated.  Some Democrats reportedly believe that this may be unnecessary.
The details of the plan are reportedly as follows:
- Set aside the $3.1 bilion undercollect in a separate account funded by a dedicated rate 	component.
- The generators can either get a check instantly from the bonds for 70% of their 	claim or they can try to get up to 100% of their claim adjudicated through a 	dispute.
- This plan could be used as a template for going to the bankruptcy judge to strike a deal 	for PG&E.
Sources indicate that the Democrats are developing a post-petition plan in cast SoCal files for bankruptcy, including the following:
- The state would buy both utilities out of bankruptcy.  It then would sell of pieces of 	the utilities to various private-sector buyers, but with a lifetime stipulation on 	how they will be run.
- Some Democrats reportedly believe the state could do this with as little as $5 billion if 	it assumed the utilities' debt and got a cram-down by the bankrutpcy judge to quell 	the protests against such a plan that would very likely erupt.  Democrats reportedly 	believe that the Judge Montali would support this idea.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Industrial Markets
EIM has recently formed a Forest Products Origination team led by Rob Saltiel to pursue structured transactions.  Typically, these deals employ a combination of physical supply/offtake, price risk management and/or finance to bring value to Enron and our customers.  Priority commodities include pulp, newsprint, recycled papers, linerboard, and lumber.  Response to the new team's efforts has been positive, as many of the Forest Products companies have needs for commodity and capital solutions that are currently unavailable.  

Enron Freight Markets
During its first month in the over-the-road (OTR) trucking business, Enron Freight Markets has completed over 120 spot OTR trades.  On Friday, March 18, there was a shortage in the Houston outbound market and capacity was selling for $1.65 per mile.  By comparison, average market price has stayed in the $1.05-$1.10 per mile range in recent weeks.

EnronOnline
On May 23, Enron Corp. announced that it completed its one-millionth transaction on EnronOnline, the world's largest web-based e-commerce platform for commodities. As an online extension of its successful wholesale energy business, EnronOnline began transacting natural gas and electricity on November 29, 1999.  Since that time, the company has extended the platform to approximately 1500 wholesale commodity products ranging from energy-related commodities to bandwidth, metals, forest products, plastics, petrochemicals, and weather and credit derivatives.

Approximately 60 percent of all Enron transactions are now conducted online, and the cost of processing the transactions has been reduced by 75 percent. 

EnronOnline Statistics

Below are the latest figures for EnronOnline as of May 23, 2001

?		Total Life to Date Transactions   > 1 million
?	Life to Date Notional Value of Transactions   > $600 billion
 

IN THE NEWS
Enron Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Skilling likes to say that the nation's leading energy merchant was ready for the Internet long before there was anything.com. Enron's business of buying and selling commodities - by phone or fax - was a natural fit for the Web. The challenge now is to get the new broadband Internet trading unit on solid footing by proving that bandwidth can be traded like a commodity. BusinessWeek e.biz/May 14,2001.

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

Janet -

1.	The best split is probably just 50/50 on personnel.  While everyone is in a specific box on the org chart, many if not all of the people are flexible enough that they can cover different roles.  The $ on outside services may be able to be split differently going forward (for example, if EES wants something specific on a state PUC matter).
2.	In terms of approving outside service expenditures, I would like to sit down with you, Louise, and Rick to work out what the best method of working through the approvals.  I will try and set up some time the first week of December.
4.	I have put Steve Montovano in the NE Gas box.  This will increase the budget by $400k (based on historical figures).  I have attached a new org chart to represent this change.

Also, Dan Staines (who is not on the Org Chart) has an Employment contract that ends 6/12/2002.  Dan has been working on Florida and Northeast RTO matters and continues to help East Power with the NYISO TCC auction.  We can sever him, but his contract will need to be paid off ($87k).  Govt Affairs also has a contract for support with Joe Connor (ex-Southern exec) to support our SE activities.  I am trying to get a copy of the contract, but I think that it is in place until 8/02.  My recommendation is to use these guys through their contracts instead of a large payment today.    

Thanks,

Jim

Subject:	FW: Govt Affairs Org Chart

EES is fine with the Org. chart below. I understand the $6.4 million is total for both ENA & EES. Comments:

1.) Need a recommended split of the $6.4 million for ENA/EES.
2.) I understand the $6.4 million includes $0 for Outside Services. The OOC of ENA/EES needs to approve as these services are needed.
3.) The $6.4 million does include legacy real estate costs. Jim Fallon is the coordination point on our real estate costs-is this on his radar screen?
4.) We need to reconcile what we do with Steve Montovano. Because both ENA/EES want to utilize him, I might suggest leaving him in the regulatory group so that both groups can effectively utilize him. Louise/Jim- are you both OK with this? If so, Rick/Jim, I would suggest putting him in the NE Gas Box.
5.) Rick, I understand you're talking with Kean/Whalley on handling the Washington office activity in Corp. I agree.

Janet --

Here is the org chart that captures our discussions.  I think that this org and the # of people is the lowest level that can even try to meet the combined needs of ENA and EES.

Total headcount = 21.  The personnel cost = $6.4 MM (total for ENA and EES).    

Please let me know if you have any questions.

John,

I think that diversification here is key. Provided that the correlation between power and gas or between different regions is less than 1 (which is almost always the case), simply spreading the investment over other commodities/regions will increase portfolio returns (i.e. same nominal P&L, less volatility).

More specifically, I would suggest the following:

1. ratchet up West "Bets"
	- I think that Tim is playing defense as of late ($7 MM P&L this month vs $600 MM in the last four months), yet he is one of the best traders
		and has the highest return on VaR for the past couple of years
	- Q4 Palo at $140 looks cheap as compared to MidC at $240, Q2-02 prices in the $80s look cheap as well
	- I will get more specific strategies on Friday after my return from Portland 
	- Cash trading - spot prices in the West were up ~$100 today

2. East desk has taken risk down in the last few days after making $122 MM this month alone. They need to reassess where they stand today and act appropriately. Some ideas are:
	- Long NY power
	- I would assess getting long SE/SERC this summer at prices below $100

3. NG Desk
	- NE: Long NY and Florida in anticipation of tight power and transmission/transportation constraints this summer
	- What is Tom Martin's secret - consistently high return on VaR and consistently positive P&L. Can it be replicated on other desks?

4. SA - get long power in Brazil by all means: close the Petrobras deal, any other prospects?

In general, I would challenge every region head to come up and describe profitable strategies (other than Nymex), based on their expertise, fundamentals, weather, etc.

Other wild ideas: 

5. Buy aluminum and steel - since a lot of smelters have been closed because of high electricity prices, aluminum and steel should get expensive

6. I am in Vegas the weekend of July 12th.

Vlady.

John,

Given the fact that the market rules have now changed to allow us to hedge transmission in ERCOT, I would like to release the schedule C associated with the LCRA transaction. The enclosed spreadsheet outlines the details.

Please let me know if there are any questions,

Thanks,

Doug Gilbert-Smith

Congratulations to you all on an exceptional effort in getting the Harrah's electricity deal closed! I know it was tough managing through the  internal issues- contract language, tariff/power pricing curve adjustments,etc- but it was the right thing to do and both the deal and Enron is much better off. 

Marty, Ken, Sean- Great job in keeping the customer at the table and still getting them to execution given all the changes in the last two weeks. 

Great job by all....congrats!

It would be great if you could give me a call some time.  The obvious disdain that Milnthorp has for my presence and the lack of contact with you has left me wondering why you still have me sitting here.  Some direction as to the future or lack there of with Enron would be good.

I find it incredibly hard to sit here every day and watch the West markets collapse and yet we see no benefit.  Despite what many may think, a lot of work went into establishing our bearish view of Sumas.  Watching C$30 to C$50 million of value not come back into the book because of a long SOCAL position has been very painful.

A couple of questions:

Will you need to keep an office here after Friday?

At what time can the move team begin your move on Friday evening?

Thanks!

Executive Summary
Edison's MOU Condemned at this Friday's CPUC Meeting
The Idle Plan Z=20
Angelides Hides State Budget Concerns=20
House Committee to Vote on Energy Relief

Edison's MOU Doubtful
The unusually calm settling over the California legislature about SoCal Edi=
son's potential bankruptcy has finally affected the relentlessly optimistic=
 investment bank analysts and other company shareholders.  We have reported=
 that through all plans from B-Z, there is not a solid plan to save this co=
mpany and now executives are even more fearful that this predictions may co=
me to fruition.

Over the last few days, Edison executives have begun pointing hard at the C=
PUC meeting this Friday as a make-or-break event for the company.  The is b=
ecause after the meeting, Davis's MOU plan to buy SoCal's grid will have no=
 chance of preventing a potential bankruptcy.  This plan is essentially dea=
d although Governor Daivs has yet to say this in a press releases.  The fin=
al nail will happen after the CPUC adjourns its Friday meeting without voti=
ng on several necessary MOU provisions.  Unless the CPUC makes a last minut=
e, emergency - amendment to their agenda,  the deal will be dead (despite S=
oCal's support for letting the deal stand past its deadline).  Sources indi=
cate that CPUC President Loretta Lynch holds reservations on the MOU and co=
ntinues to distance herself from Davis. =20

Attempting to influence policy making, Edison executives have spent the las=
t few investor phone conferences warning that June 8 would see substantiall=
y increased risks for a creditor-induced bankruptcy if the Davis plan dies =
at CPUC.  This is interesting, since no one else seems to have been focused=
 on the date until Edison began mentioning it late last week.  However, the=
re is no more or less threat of bankruptcy than there is now or will be in =
two weeks.   As reported several times earlier, most everyone had given up =
on the MOU long before this Friday's CPUC meeting.

Plan Z Shows Little Progress
Meanwhile, the unhurried pace toward a Plan Z that we reported last Friday,=
 has gained little progress.  Legislators continue to pin-point a plan that=
 will secure re-election votes and at the same time, weigh the need for rat=
e hikes for California's corporate and home electricity users.  As they has=
h it out, the state is spending even more on electricity purchases.  In spi=
te of better than expected levels of conservation, the state's electricity =
expenditures over the last month rose to an average of $79M/day. The recent=
 rate increases mean more spending by the state and that calls into questio=
n the reassuring Angelides scenario for California's budget prospects later=
 this year.

The California Budget Crunch
Even more worrisome than a idle Plan Z is increasing evidence that last mon=
th's conference call with State Treasurer Angelides was a little misleading=
. During that conference call Angelides claimed that State Comptroller Conn=
ell and many in the financial committee had the numbers wrong.  Angelides a=
rgued that $7.2B already spent to buy power since January was really the to=
tal amount of authorized spending through late August.  In fact, he said on=
ly $4.3B of that had been "spent."  Sources now indicate that  Angelides wa=
s technically correct if you use "spent" to mean only the amount of money f=
or which checks had been written.  This is different than the amount of mon=
ey California had already promised to energy suppliers who had already supp=
lied energy to the state.  In fact, when Angelides was speaking the state h=
ad in fact already promised to pay $7B for energy it had already consumed (=
the total committed has topped $8B.)  By the time the state gets its "power=
 bonds" auctioned in August, they will have already spent all $12B and be b=
ack to dipping into the General Fund.   The idea of RANs being auctioned be=
fore the power bonds get issued is still an option if the general fund does=
n't make it to August.=20

The nearest answer to both of these cash flow deficits lies in part in the =
painful process that the legislature is undertaking now - another round of =
huge electricity rate hikes to securitize debt issuance.  Then the hope is =
that those hikes bridge the gap between now and when new capacity brings wh=
olesale rates down and the debts can be repaid.   The only near term path t=
o bringing generating assets on line immediately is the 3,500 MW from QF pl=
ants which are off line because of cash flow problems.  Settling their need=
s is wrapped up in settling the PG&E and Edison trade creditor issues, whic=
h makes the legislature's leisurely approach to the rate hike/haircut situa=
tion all the more troublesome.

Energy Relief
The House Energy & Commerce Committee is scheduled to vote on H.R. 1647 (th=
e Emergency Electricity Relief Act) tomorrow at 10:00 am.  The bill which w=
as twice postponed and does not include any provisions on price caps, but d=
uring the course of the mark-up, sources indicate that it is possible, even=
 likely, that a Democrat could offer a price cap amendment.  Rep. Waxman (D=
-CA) offered a price cap amendment at an earlier mark-up of the bill at the=
 subcommittee level.  The Waxman amendment was rejected along party lines (=
all Republicans and 2 Democrats voted nay).  Sources inside Joe Barton's of=
fice report that staff and members have been meeting to work out a compromi=
se on the price cap issue, but nothing has been resolved. As of this aftern=
oon, those discussions have been terminated in favor of an open discourse i=
n the Committee tomorrow.  Since an agreement was not reached, compromise l=
anguage is not expected to be offered as an amendment tomorrow.  If it is, =
it would not be something that leaders on the Republican and Democrat sides=
 have crafted together and therefore would not likely pass.  Sources indica=
te that the committee does expect Waxman, and possibly others to offer pric=
e cap language, but it is not expected to pass.

depends what you mean by "profitable"

"George" looks like he's down $19m but when you strip out the internal trades, he's taken $1.5m of the outside world's money, before the cost of hedges against extreme moves, plus the big move was the January gapping in crude

So I'm a buyer if only to see what happens

John,
I'm hearing we are thinking about going to 24 hour trading. You are aware that the "machine" in crude is not profitable.  It is my understanding that crude has lost approx.$20MM on this algorithm year-to-date.   (FYI, at 11:00am it was down 132K for today's action)

For whatever it is worth, I'm a seller of this idea.  (Unless of course, someone tells me that something has changed. And if it is fixable, why haven't the crude boys fixed it?)

Frank

About a month ago I held a  meeting in Houston to bring together the systems, operations, and commercial people who were responsible for designing and building our wholesale and retail systems.  There were probably twenty people there, including Beth Perlman, Anthony Dayao, Beth Appollo, Bob Hall, Leslie Reeves, Lloyd Will, Todd Busby, Greg Woulfe, Rogers Herndon, Murray O'Neil, Steve Nat, Jeff Richter, Thresa Allen, Pablo ?, Mark Pickering, Dale Furrow, and many more.  

Two of my suspicions were confirmed in this meeting.  First, it was clear that there were a bunch of people working in silos.  Beth's group was just starting to talk to Anthony's group.  The site profile team wasn't on the same page as Richter who wasn't necessarily in sync with Herndon.  EES and ENA (and for that matter east ENA and west ENA) volume management and RTO settlements people weren't talking to one another.  Second, it was clear that nobody had tried to map out what all of the necessary functions are and how they should fit together.  We tasked Todd Busby, Debra Bailey, and Lloyd Will to spend a month talking to each group and "drawing the picture" of all of the systems that were being worked on and how they should fit together.  They brought in a couple of people from Accenture to assist with this project.

The powerpoint presentation below documents their findings.  I would encourage you to look at pages 11 through 15 which summarize the issues and recommendations.  Here are the highlights:
Power IT and operations remain organizationally divided between Wholesale and Retail
Settlements development efforts are not global
Create one power IT & one operations organization for retail and wholesale power
Create power program management team to coordinate business requirements for trading, risk, settlements & volume mngt across wholesale and retail desks

Our systems and operations efforts are in chaos right now in terms of getting prepared for the future of wholesale and retail power.  If you think about how decisions and priorities are established you have a half dozen commercial people (me, Richter, Presto, Will, Herndon, Woulfe, ...) working with a few operations people (White, Appollo, Albrecht, O'Neil, Hall) and a handful of systems people (Dayao, Nat, Stock, Perlman) to come up with a plan.  It just isn't working.  We need a structure and we need it fast.  Chaos is expensive and ineffective.

Here's what I want:
One Operations Person Responsible for Wholesale and Retail Power
One Systems Person Responsible for Wholesale and Retail Power
One Commercial Person Responsible for Overseeing All Wholesale and Retail Power Systems Development
One Project Manager Working for the Commercial Person to Coordinate and Run Herd Over These Efforts.

There are a number of variants of what I want that could work.  We need to get this thing figured out ASAP.  Please advise on how you recommend moving forward.

Tim,

I made the following changes to the presentation which are not required for your distribution if you have already sent it out:

1.  page 10 first bullet - changed "one power and operations organization" to "one power and one operations organization" .

2.  page 11 - modified colors to clarify point

EES is fine with the Org. chart below. I understand the $6.4 million is total for both ENA & EES. Comments:

1.) Need a recommended split of the $6.4 million for ENA/EES.
2.) I understand the $6.4 million includes $0 for Outside Services. The OOC of ENA/EES needs to approve as these services are needed.
3.) The $6.4 million does include legacy real estate costs. Jim Fallon is the coordination point on our real estate costs-is this on his radar screen?
4.) We need to reconcile what we do with Steve Montovano. Because both ENA/EES want to utilize him, I might suggest leaving him in the regulatory group so that both groups can effectively utilize him. Louise/Jim- are you both OK with this? If so, Rick/Jim, I would suggest putting him in the NE Gas Box.
5.) Rick, I understand you're talking with Kean/Whalley on handling the Washington office activity in Corp. I agree.

Janet --

Here is the org chart that captures our discussions.  I think that this org and the # of people is the lowest level that can even try to meet the combined needs of ENA and EES.

Total headcount = 21.  The personnel cost = $6.4 MM (total for ENA and EES).    

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Jim

I would welcome your participation.  Brad Snyder who is working in Jeff Ade=
r's group will also be attending.  Jim Wood originally agreed to go and I a=
m trying to confirm his attendance as well.  A few others in sales have als=
o expressed an interest and so we still need to assemble the team.  The ite=
ms you listed can all be covered.  The purpose of the meeting was to see if=
 we could put together a deal that would allow AEP to provide us with whole=
sale power as an interim solution to our inability to do physical deals.  A=
lternatively, if we can work with AEP to figure out a way to do our own del=
ivery, so much the better.  I view this as a stop gap measure to get us ent=
ry into the market while working on the RTO for a permanent solution.  Afte=
r we see how things go with AEP, the thought was for me to contact Cinergy =
to arrange for similar discussions.  As you know, Cinergy also has decent s=
hopping credits (although not quite as good as AEP) that are available cont=
ingent on physical delivery. =20

I am attaching for your review the summary I prepared for AEP on the scope =
of our meeting.  I am planning the meeting for 2:00pm.  Logistical details =
to follow.

I would like to go to AEP on the 7th.  Their egos may not allow them to neg=
otiate as fairly with me at the table (due to wholesale side) but I really =
need to get in front of these utilities in person to understand what obstac=
les we will face in the physical delivery world.  =20

I am still a novice on these issues but I would like to achieve the folloow=
ing on the physical side, some of which may already exist.  Your comments w=
ould be helpful.

Ability to aggregate customers into pool so that we can serve hourly load m=
ore effectively
Would like for AEP to review our aggregated customer list and provide us wi=
th day ahead and hourly load forecasts so that we know how many Mw to deliv=
er each hour
Pre-determined energy imbalance service=20
Pre-determined ancillary fees
Pricing Incentives for us to serve more load
Basic walk-through of standard protocol necessary to serve load physically

These are my quick thoughts.  Kevin, do you have any further thoughts.

Thanks,
Rogers

John, 

As per our conversation yesterday, I suggest that we put the two trades that you closed with us in January (25 MW baseload swap, 1 year, Feb. 01 to Jan 02) back on the MTM books and give you simultaneously the opportunity to close these positions.  Our prices for  June 01 - Jan 02 swap rates are as follows:

Argentina power $18.50 - $20.40 per MWh (this is a bid-offer spread in US dollars; you are currently long)
Brazil power R$425 - R$475 per MWh (this is a bid-offer spread in reais; you are currently short);

We are also making sure that there will be no adverse tax impact for Enron.

Please let me know if you agree to close these positions.

Remi

John,

SA
MM plant is booked as of today, both positions and P&L. I will describe the complete process in an email in the next few days.

We have processed the SEC Form 144 for the sale of 1,270,000 shares of COPEL.

I wanted to revise SA reporting, specifically:
	- break out an origination line
	- add COPEL MTM below the line
	- start the process of calculating P&L and VaR by trader

EES
I have taken an initiative to compile a strategic list of activities that need to be completed to put this business back on track. The list will include activities at various levels of detail, responsible individuals and timetables. The activities on the list will be discussed/updated in weekly meetings, hosted by Rogers and Don. I have met with Rogers/Don and, subsequently, with Sally/Wes, all of whom have embraced this list as a useful management tool and provided feedback. I will send the latest one to you shortly and welcome you to comment/critique it. Additionally, this centralized master list will serve help Rick Buy get comfortable with the fact that the progress is being made.

Vlady.

I agree  with comments and would like make clear my position : ONLY MAE members should be allowed to do these transactions. Moreover it is necessary insert same time basis ( MAE MWh is between first and last day in a month and customer basis depends on reading day). To make confortable these transactions customers would receive with its monthly billing a paper allwing them negotiate with a MAE meber its month MWh saved.

Remi

Things are changing.
This issue is still under discussion and the new proposed measures allow consumers to sell to generators, distributors and traders.
If this happens, their price is going to raise to MAE price (or close to). The main issue now is "Is MAE goig to start settling?".
I'll keep informing you guys.

Fred

Subject:	Re: mae measures   

That's one of the topics I wanted to address PRIORITARILY this afternoon.  According to Luis Otavio and Fred, customers A (alta tens?o, and demand greater than 2.5MW) will ONLY be allowed to sell "excess power" not consumed (capped at their "cota" or "meta" or quota) to OTHERS CONSUMERS, but not to MARKETERS.  The reason for this is that ANEEL/Parente don't want to "flood" MAE with positions to settle (the argument is, if MAE cannot manage 67 counterparties, they won't be able to manage several hundreds).  But it's crazy: all unbalanced (net) positions will be settled in spot market: if marketers are not allowed to act as intermediaries, there will be hundreds of net, bilateral positions to settle (and it WILL flood MAE), if marketers like Enron can be in the middle they will net themselves all positions on portfolio basis and they will show only ONE position in MAE.

This mechanism is no different from the often discussed concept of DEMAND SIDE MANAGEMENT.  The only way to make it work is to allow LIQUIDITY and therefore competition and therefore Marketers. 

It is vital that Marketers be authorized to acquire and sell this power, and settle their net position (net position only) in spot market.  EOL will be a great tool for this, and we may accelerate its launch in Brazil with this new, different product ("Restricted Power")

Subject:	mae measures

One of the proposals under review with the Apag?o team is to allow the B and A costumers to access the Mae and transact their "contracted energy" after their respective 20-25% reduction targets.  The MAE and the distributors do not have the systems in place to deal  with over 1,800,000 customers in the entire system. Elektro alone has close to 150000 customers in this class.    This can be a tremendous oportunity for Enron on Line to take off.  Remi could you review and prepare an action plan urgently.  These measures are targeted to be released next week.

Rogers,

Subject:	Pending Reg Switch Option Deals?

Everyone -

Are there any Reg Switch Option Deals currently in the pipeline?  Specifically, I mean deals whereby we offer a near term index that goes away either date certain or upon de-reg date and switches to an Index plus adder.  The assumption historically being that we offset the near term discount by purcahsing standard offer service post dereg which is valued lower than index + adder.

On a broader note, do we have ANY deals coming down the pipe that are predicated on us receiving the benefit of Standard Offer Service (date certain or otherwise).  

Jay -  can you come up with a game plan for identifying our potential current MTM-P&L exposure relating to date certain de-reg and standard offer assumptions.

Thanks,
Rogers

John,

As we have discussed before, it appears that combining Texas gas and power origination activities is not going to work.  The final nail in the coffin is the fact that in the new building we continue to be on two different floors.  As a result, I would like your thoughts about how to manage the origination activities in Texas.  In my mind there are several possible solutions: 
	1.  Have Barry Tycholiz manage both the West and Texas origination
	2.  Combine EES Texas retail with wholesale under Mark Courtney (EES has been chasing wholesale gas business in Texas)
	3.  Have Brian Redmond manage Texas origination (Delainey suggested it; I don't know what you have planned for him but he has contacts with the TRC and 	     customers)

Also, I am continuing to interview for one trader and for one middle marketer with the assistance of Todd Piekert in HR.  He has been identifying third rotation associates for me.  One of the candidates that I have been talking to is Charles Weldon who was approved into the trading track program yesterday.  I am going to talk to him again soon, I would like to be able to have him assigned to my desk either as a trader or originator depending where his skills best fit.  The other candidate is Justin Corrnett.  I have not talked to him yet but I want to know what you thoughts are on all of the above before I go too much farther.

I will get on your calender soon.

Tom

Kevin/John - 

I will be widening our mid-offer spreadss substantially (25%) today to account for our lack of liquidity in the power markets.  Will continue to monitor and increase/decrease as we feel appropriate.  This may cause some heartburn with EES but I feel my approach is better than the alternative.

When appropriate I would like to sit down with you and review current initiatives.  Would like to do this in a smaller group than our typical Thursday meetings.

Thanks,
Rogers

We have an agreement in principle for a resolution of our investment entanglement at Canfibre Riverside and Canfibre Lackawanna:

	There will be no draw on the $4.5 million Enron obligation to fund Lackawanna based upon acceptance tests.
	Any such funding would have benefited only the senior lenders at this facility (of which we are not one).

	There will be complete release of Enron and subsidiaries for any claims, including underwriters' liability relating
	to Enron's promotion and sale of the Lackawanna bonds.  This release will cover any current or past contracts
	or agreements at any time related to our investment and ownership.  It does not include potential claims on the
	power contract at Riverside that was terminated when that company went into bankruptcy.  This contract could
	not be included since all the unsecured creditors at Riverside are stakeholders.
	
	Enron will receive $250K in cash.

In return:

	Enron will assign the Canfibre loans and the stock of the Canfibre group to the senior bondholders.

Enron's investment in the loans and stock included in this deal were written-off totally last year.  We were facing an additional potential write-off of $4.5 million this year relating to the Lackawanna additional funding.  In addition to the $4.8 million hard-dollar recovery, this transaction avoids a very real, substantial potential liability due to Enron's heavy involvement (and specific underwriting of Lackawanna) in the two Canfibre deals in which well in excess of $200 million investment (over $150 million of which came from third parties) was lost in two catastrophic financial disasters.  Richard Sanders has confirmed that getting rid of any claim on underwriters' liability has significant value in this situation.  We avoid continuing to incur substantial legal and professional expenses over a prolonged period.  We terminate significant commercial and legal time and effort that is much more productively reassigned elsewhere.

If the deal is closed, I view this resolution as a grandslam home run in the bottom of the ninth.  Through a barrage of analyses and negotiation, John Enerson managed to create some leverage where none existed that eventually forced the Canfibre bondholders into finally recognising that we were more than ready to fight them aggressively on every issue by all means available and bring them to the table.  In the end we got virtually everything we could possibly have obtained under any reasonable scenario.  John has handled this deal with creativity and persistence and deserves credit for orchestrating a very sensitive situation.  Wayne Mays from Technical Services provided key engineering support.

The documentation and closing of this transaction is scheduled to occur early next week.  Normally I would wait for closing to report success.  Since this deal was put together very rapidly, however, I wanted time to clarify any questions that might arise prior to final execution.  Of course, given that the status is agreement in principle, there is always the chance (we believe it is highly unlikely) that the deal could fall apart.

Good Morning!

Bottom line: No Changes.

For the near term (1-5), we see some cool anomalies arriving into the Dakotas by Monday already, with highs in the Dakotas in the mid-30s and lows in the mid-teens.By Tuesday, Texas and the Midwest will be in the below normal category, with Dallas overnights in the mid-30s (normal low 43), Houston's low in the mid-40s (normal upper-40s) and Chicago will freeze, with a mid-20 overnight.  Progressing into the Northeast by wednesday, Philly and New York will get into the below normal category, but 5 or 6 degree anomalies are most likely.  Looks like a three day event as it moves easterly and then is followed by moderation into the...

6-10 Day time period, which will see a cool shot over the Midwest/East towards next weekend, moderating again by early the following week. Then, early in the...

11-15 Day time period, more cool air moves in, beginning with central cooling, then even into the Southeast.

So, with normals dropping across the nation, this first cool air anomaly event arriving in the Midwest by Tuesday will elevate the nation's gas demand requirements into the 60 Bcf/d plus regime from here on through the winter.  Here's the strip beginning with today:

Sat 	11/17	47 Bcfd
Sun	11/18	52 Bcfd 
Mon	11/19	55 Bcfd
Tue	11/20	67 Bcfd

Till tomorrow,

At the request of the NEB, TransCanada has sent out a notice to shippers and interested parties
for comments on TCPL's application addressing the proposed Mainline Services and Pricing 
Settlement.  They are also requesting comments on "the need for and the nature of a further process
to consider the Application".   Comments must be filed by Wednesday, May 23,2001.  

Kevin Heal from our Calgary Office, represented Enron in the Settlement discussions.  Enron elected
to abstain when the vote was taken to approve the Settlement.  Sithe/Independence voted to
oppose and litigate the Settlement.

To maximize the value of the Sithe/Independence TCPL capacity (i.e. St. Clair to Chippawa & Kirkwall
to Chippawa contracts), it is very important that Sithe continue to actively participate in the
NEB's regulatory process and file comments by the deadline.  Behind the scenes, I 
recommend that we work with Sithe's legal counsel to coordinate a response to this 
request in case this capacity is assigned to Enron at a later date.  

I also recommend that Enron either change our earlier position from abstention to 
opposition of the Settlement, or combine the Empress to Chippawa contract that is
dedicated to the Sithe/Independence deal with Sithe's other capacity.  Kevin has 
provided the attached information of the other Toll Task Force members that voted to abstain, 
oppose, or oppose and litigate the Settlement.  It appears that most of the marketers, cogens and
IPP's fall in this camp.  

There are several features to the Settlement that may create additional value that 
has not yet been captured in our restructuring analysis.  I believe that only by taking 
an aggressive stand in the regulatory process, can this additional value be realized.  TCPL's
"FT Make-Up" and "AOS" features will create additional value for 2001 and 2002.   The "Turnback
Procedure" is designed to mitigate actual costs of TCPL's proposed Waddington and Niagara
expansions.  If some, or all of Sithe's capacity can be turned back to the pipeline, value may be
created starting in late 2002 and possibly through the termination of Sithe's contracts.

If there is any other information needed or I can assist in any way, please call me at x31667.

Ruth

Grigsby's SoCal book was transferred to Phillip Allen for liquidation.  Grigsby will be responsible for trading the gas daily book.  

Lessons learned:
?	Grigsby doubled down at the top of the market, (see price graph below, light blue line).
?	The element of time.  While the fundamental analysis regarding storage looks correct, the timing of the trade appears to have been too early.
?	Core and non core SoCal customers
o	Core - The West desk fundamental analysis considered only the core users, who can't/wont forward hedge because their price risk is inherently tied to index.  This being the case, there is sentiment is that the trade will return,  however the time between today and then is too long, too risky.
o	Non Core - Analysis here did not truly recognize that the non core customer base can/will in fact forward hedge, or that their hedging would have a material impact on the curve.  It is my understanding that these non core customers are selling gas and buying power in the back of the curve, (note both NP-15 power prices and SoCal have dropped from mid-March) and in the front of the gas curve,  they are buying.  
?	As an aside - as the political rhetoric heats up, the market place appears to be getting jittery --that while nothing will be done tomorrow, something may in fact be done in the long run, impacting prices.

 I spoke with Grigsby regarding any other large counter parties that may be experiencing similar "pain" and he said that basically Enron is the only one, so it appears as if counterparty credit risks are minimal.

John,

The news story relates to this report that DWR released today.  They held a press release.  They said that the state would honor all of the executed agreements, but any non-binding "agreements in principle" would be subject to renegotiation.  In general, they say they have executed about 6,000MW of long term agreements and about 5,000MW under "agreements in principle".  

DWR signed our Master Agreement.  We are holding off signing it because of litigation risk, per Tim and Legal.  

Chris

Enron Industrial Markets has identifed a candidate in the London market that we wish to bring into Enron at the VP level.  He is a highly experienced individual with over 30 years of steel experience and would run the origination effort for steel in London reporting to Bruce Garner.  He has met several members of the executive committee already (see attachment) and his resume is attached to this email.  Ray Bowen will present him at the next executive committee meeting for approval.  If you have any questions or comments, please contact me as soon as possible.

we settled the lawsuit with Iris Wong v. ECC  yesterday. She has agreed to drop the lawsuit and pay our legal costs. Once again the adage holds true that there is no such thing as a free lottery ticket.

Saw this and thought of you. 

Congratulations on the new baby.  You know, I am not sure which is more stressful, having a baby or being at Enron the last few days.

See you when you get back.

John, 

After your conversation with Paul yesterday, we have evaluated the option of moving all of GAS and POWER next weekend, we will be able to move everyone in a single move, however we will need a firm commitment by midday Tuesday, in order for us to get the workforce, move the broker lines and all the other tasks associated with this scale of move.

If you would like to proceed, please let me or Bill Donovan know as soon as practicable, so we can facilitate the migration. 

If we do not move next weekend, this will cause real problems with the resources and contracts in place, staff and suppliers are on vacation through thanksgiving and the move data will soon be out of date which will need to be reconciled which would increase the cost.


Martin Bucknell

I was wondering if the Bammel lease to AEP contains any operating parameters to protect the integrity of the facility.  The question arises from the fact that Bammel  had about 24 BCF of remaining capacity when Enron turned the facility over to AEP.  We believe their plan is to max inject in June which would reduce the remaining capacity to around 12 BCF.  It could become a challenge to keep injections under the remaining 12 BCF level during the reaming 4-5 months of the injection cycle.  Enron always operated the facility with the understanding that a Gas In Place volume greater than 117.5 BCF could create a high enough pressure to jeopardize the safety of the wellhead casings and some of the abandoned wells.  We would not want the Texas RRC to question the safety of the Bammel facility.  From the other end of the perspective if the Gas In Place is taken below 65 BCF their is a high probability of watering out the outer wells and the facility itself.

Mcleod Dixon has a call on our floor 3 years out and all indications are that they would take it now if they could. Manulife has just renovated 34 at a huge cost and it is therefore unlikely that they would be moving anytime soon. As far as squeezing in more people, it is likely that we are already in breach of the fire/building codes (but I'm afraid to ask anyone).

My thoughts are the same.  You should stay in Canterra.  We can squeeze way more desks on that floor and I'm sure you can boot someone out below or above over the next couple of years.  Given the experience with the walls I would stick to your day job.

John, I want to re-confirm your approval to enter into a new lease. We need to give notice to Canterra by end of June on whether we are extending for an additional 3 years to June 2005 or terminating our lease June 2002. 

I'm currently negotiating on 3 different sites as well as discussing the extension with Oxford:

Canterra		3 year lease - no renewal rights - $26sq/ft at 20,000 sq. ft. No ability to expand contiguously. Currently, at capacity.

TCPL Tower		Conoco has 3 floors (26,27,28 at 25,000 sq.ft/floor). With Gulf takeover, they will consolidate into Gulf Square. Looking for 3 floor 				sub-lease tenant. Likely $25/sq.ft 10 year lease w/renewal rights. Good floor-plate (column-free rectangle). One floor would likely be 			adequate for the next few years. Would overlap canterra lease by likely 9 months.

Bankers Hall		Calpine has 2 floors (39,40 at 19,000 sq.ft/floor). With Encal takeover, they will consolidate into Canada Trust. Looking for 2 floor 				sub-lease tenant. Likely $25/sq.ft. 10 year lease w/renewal rights. One floor would be less than adequate - 2 floors would be more 				than we need for the next few years. Would overlap canterra lease by likely 9 months.

Phillips Warehouse	2 floor warehouse being converted to 3 floor office bldg. 10 year lease w/renewal rights on 35,000 sq.ft at $20sq/ft. Will build to suit and 			Enron would have building naming rights. Timing with expiry of Canterra lease is good (Occupy date would be 1st qtr, 2002). 

My preference is to target the Phillip's brothers warehouse.Timing, location, price, sq.footage, parking all look good. They are willing to deal with us exclusively and have aspirations of designing a state-of-the-art office building (this is consistent with their reputation) while Calpine/Conoco want to free-option us while they look for multi-floor tenants (much like what happened when we made an offer on TCPL tower previously and they used it to lever Hunt Oil into a mulit-floor lease).  

Let me know your thoughts on this as I need to move fairly quickly.

John, first off, congrats on your promotion! 

You may recall that our Canterra lease expires June, 2002. When we consolidated our floor space on 35, we were able to incorporate an option to extend the 35th floor lease (at market rate approx $24 sq.ft) for an additional 3 years to June, 2005. Notice to extend has to be provided June of this year. 

The reason I'm bringing this to your attention is that I'm concerned that we will not be able to accomodate any growth for years 2002 - 2005 in our current space. We will be at 115 employees this summer (150 sq. ft./employee) and our max is 130 (135 sq.ft/employee) which should get us through June 2002.

Given this, I have explored a number of leasing opportunities outside of Canterra with the goal of finding a floor plate more conducive to a trading organization. You may recall that TransCanada was in the process of building a new office tower across from Esso Plaza. They are now in the process of sub-leasing a number of the floors. 

The tower was designed for their own trading organization and is the largest column-free floor plate in Canada (28,000 sq. ft.). It's state of the art technology includes a raised floor system for wiring (ie no coring). Coral Canada recently leased two floors in the tower for their Canadian trading operation. 

We are looking at the 31st floor at $24 sq. ft for a 10 year term with some overlap with our current lease for build-out. At 135 sq. ft/employee we would be able to staff 200 employees. However, given the rectangular/column-free floor plate, we probably could get down to 100 sq. ft/employee (270 employees). This should be sufficient for many years to come.

Please let me know whether we should proceed in negotiating a lease with TCPL.

Regards
Milnthorp

John baby, 
What are you up to?  Are you in Houston?  If so, we should touch base @ some point.  Still with Enron?  Do you run the company yet?  Are you responsible for my pricing at the pump?  I have been back in Dallas since '95 and am working with The Carlyle Group...getting married in August...you?
Hope all is well.

John,

I know you have heard this from Tim, and I know you did not ask me, but...morale is pretty low because of the stock price, EES, EBS, litigation, etc. I think it makes sense to pay more $ to keep the rest of Tim's uncontracted team.  

On my side, most of my key people are under contract already - originators dont negotiate as well as traders.  

Regards,

Chris

John,
I haven't spoken to you in a while and trust that your off to another strong year and that your family is well settled in Houston.  As you may have heard, I have spent the last year in Japan with Global Mkts trying to help kickstart an fx and interest rate trading operation that would tie this region into our global operation. 

Something has arisen personally and wanted to ask you in confidence of any potential opportunities that you may be aware of in Canada for a trading and/or origination role, perhaps in the next 2-5 months time.  My wife is keen to relocate near her family in Montreal, and so ideally I am wondering if you are aware of any needs that Rob Milnthorp, David Delainey, or yourself may have in that area, be it in metals, power, gas etc. I am aware of a satellite metals office in Montreal under a Director named Jean Michaud, as well as the recent Quebec City paper mill acquisition but am not aware of any other activities which we are involved with in that region. 

Thanks for your time, John

Sincerely,
Darren

Attached pls find resume

We tried all day to sell this volume below.  Market is extremely illiquid, given Annex V uncertainty and other regulatory issues: generators believe Parente will help them out in May, while LDCs look at their contracts and reduced demand.  However AES Sul accepted to buy this volume at 25% discount to May spot price, payment on June 25th.  We will net about R$600,000 (US$250,000) between sale and purchase prices.  Credit is OK.

We will keep a very small, long position at MAE settlement for May.

Lloyd - 

Can you work up a game plan on this technology - (costs, who could install, do we need utility approval, etc.).  I think we should present our requirements to EES, make the installation our contractual option with the customer, begin pricing the cost into each deal and get a real install done.

Also, I think we should offer to administer the data side (gathering, dissemination, load forecasting) and EES should have the customer contact/install responsibility.  

As soon as we have our hands around the IT/technical issues let's discuss and push through EES.

Thanks,
Rogers

I think we should install 15 minute metering capability and start serving these customers physically.   In order to grow this business, we need to find out if we can serve retail load directly in an efficient and cost-effective manner.   The quicker we can achieve physical delivery capability, the quicker we can define our true cost of serving these customers.

John:

The purpose of the call tomorrow at 9:00 am is to update you on the status of the MHI turbines and to discuss an alternative structure.  The following are the different approaches that we are currently pursuing with respect to the turbines:

I am working with two brokers in the US for the sale of turbine 2.  At this point, there are discussions on-going with three or four parties interested in the turbine.  We are targeting an end of June close.
We have offered the RioGen site for sale with turbines.  We currently have received two indicative offers.  Tractabel has offered to purchase the site with turbines 3 and 4 for an approximate $10 to $15 million gain.  AES is offering to buy the site with turbines 2, 3 and 4 under a fixed price EPC concept.  The amount and schedule of their initial offer was tight (in addition to the fact that we do not have any desire to take EPC risk).  AES will reply with a new offer in the next few days based on our initial feedback with these thoughts.  El Paso will provide us an offer within 10 days.  Duke may also be interested.
Petrobras has continued to push us on the RioGen project.  They have received a new mandate to increase capacity given the deteriorating situation in the market with rationing and would be interested in purchasing the turbines and site from us at a minimum.  The latest proposal and potential structure from Petrobras includes an offer from Petrobras to work with an Eletrobolt type structure, but also give Enron a put of the project if we decide not to proceed with construction at a certain point in the future.  Attached is an outline of the basic structure of a potential deal.  We would like to discuss the feasability of such a deal given our previous discussions.  I understand your position in the past on similar projects, but I feel that this might be a potential solution which addresses the risk of the turbine position and gives us significant optionality on capacity.

Thanks,
Brett

Subject:	PCH deal verbally closed

After one month of negotiations, we received today a verbal closing from PCH Salto Lobo, under the following conditions:

plant location	: Brotas (SP) - CPFL territory
power amount	: up to 1.5 MW (interruptible)
pricing and term: 
Jan 02 - Dec 03	: R$90/MWh
Jan 04 - Dec 06	: R$67/MWh
delivery point	: SE center of gravity (Salto Lobo pays for T&D and we take the T losses)

Karla, since this deal will fall under the non-firm, non-MAE member type of structure, I'll take the initiative to fill the draft contract and send you for legal approval.

I would like to stress the key role that Elio Kumoto played on this deal. The deal originally came to Enron through him and Elio actively participated on the negotiation and technical assessment of the plant.

Rds,

Marcelo

Energy Cos Limit Business With Enron After 10Q -Traders
By Mark Golden

11/20/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

  NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Many energy trading companies were unwilling to sell
power and natural gas for next day delivery to Enron Corp. (ENE) Tuesday
morning, a result of heightened credit concerns following the release of
Enron's quarterly financial report Monday, traders and other sources said.

  For weeks, companies have limited both buying and selling with Enron for
future deliveries. But for the first time since Enron's troubles began a month
ago, energy companies weren't selling to Enron in the spot markets for fear
that Enron might not be able to pay its bills as soon as next month.
  "It's pretty well accepted in the industry that people are staying away for
now," said Charlie Sanchez, energy market manager for Gelber & Associates in
Houston.

  Traders at all of the major companies contacted said they couldn't sell to
Enron Tuesday morning. Several spokespeople for energy companies confirmed the
situation, but declined to say so on the record.

  "Nobody will take Enron," one western electricity broker said. After
struggling, however, that broker eventually found a utility that was willing
to sell to Enron Tuesday morning.

  Calpine, a prominent independent power producer and trader, said it was
willing to sell power to Enron.

  "We continue to sell power to Enron and are monitoring the situation
closely," spokeswoman Catherine Potter said.

  The situation Tuesday morning was fluid. One utility that refused to sell to
Enron in the morning was willing to do so in the afternoon, a person at the
company said. That company's trading, however, was still limited to the spot
markets.

  Credit concerns about the once-dominant energy trading company were
heightened with Enron's filing of its third quarter annual report Monday
evening with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission.

  Enron may have to pay $690 million on a note that became a demand obligation
with the company's most recent credit-rating downgrade, Enron said in Monday's
filing. The company also warned that its profits in the fourth quarter could
be hurt by credit concerns, a decline in asset values and reduced trading
activity.

  "The 10Q in and by itself is a document that could raise concerns," Fitch
analyst Ralph Pellecchia said. "We have a lot of questions outstanding
relative to disclosures that were new to us and their strategies of how they
are going to manage the situation."

  Companies are willing to buy from Enron in the spot gas and power markets,
because taking delivery on commodity and paying for it a month later poses no
credit risk for the buyer.

John,

I've been approached by a couple of loads in Montana totalling 50-75 MWs.  Zufferli and I did some rough math on the costs of transmission and what our implied offer would be and haven't heard back from the counterparties.  I think that you need more critical mass to make a project work.

Fed Ex the PPA sales pitch to me.
 
Also, I read in the newspaper that Montana was tight for power.  I couldn't tell wether they are tight or the price is just high.  Can we sell long term power to a counterparty or two or three in Montana and build a line?
 
John

Hello All,

I'm planning the agenda for this year's Management Conference.  I've been working on the upcoming meeting since March, but as you can imagine, the direction has changed several times.  

We are delighted to have General Norman Schwarzkopf delivering a keynote address on leadership, and Gary Hamel returning to help us process the past year.  While we have arranged an all-star line up of outside speakers, we also want to focus on what is happening inside Enron.  Rather than having only one or two business presentations, Mark Frevert has opted to moderate a panel to provide a high level overview of each of our primary operating units and has selected each of you to participate.

Currently, the panel is scheduled to take place 8:00-9:30am on Friday, November 16.  Please plan to present a very high level overview of your business.  You are welcome to use PowerPoint slides, but in the interest of time, presentations must be no more than 10 minutes.  Mark will introduce each of you, interject questions, encourage interaction, and ensure we stay on time. 

Below is the proposed order for your presentations.  Regardless of your place in the rundown, you will need to be seated on stage by 7:50am and equipped with a microphone.  Because we have a full agenda that morning, we will try to begin the session promptly at 8:00am.

Stan Horton - Global Services
Louise Kitchen - Americas
John Sherriff - Europe
Mike McConnell - Global Markets
Jeff McMahon - Industrial Markets
Janet Dietrich - Retail

If you elect to use a PowerPoint presentation, please forward it to me electronically by Friday, November 9 or provide the presentation to me on CD at the Management Conference.  To ensure consistancy, I've attached a PowerPoint template that I would like you to use.  

 

Finally, Mark would like to meet with the six of you to finalize preparation for the panel at 4:00pm on Wednesday, November 14 following your arrival at the Management Conference.  The meeting will take place in the Library off the Main Lobby of the Westin La Cantera.  In the meantime, if you have any questions or need any assistance, please contact me.  I look forward to working with you.

Regards,
Terrie James

John,

Just so you know, I was able to speak with Thompson about the E&P assets and that we would need $135MM.  He response was that the price was too high!  He wants to get together today with Jesus and me and discuss our valuation. 

I bet he calls you and I wanted  you to know that we are talking.

Don

Bill, FYI, I have received a formal request from PGT asking Enron to provide security on their pipeline.  The request is for approx $ 11MM. They are referencing a provision in their tariff  that says that if a co. goes below BBB by S&P, then they have the right to ask for security.

I have discussed this request with them and they assure me we are not being singled out. I told them we will review the letter with credit and management and get back to them prior to the deadline imposed on their request( Nov. 20).

A copy of this request will be on your desk first thing this a.m.

regards, BT

Sumas has been priced flat or weaker to AECO, so there  has been less gas going North from Stanfield and less gas hitting Sumas because of the outage. There was also
a restriction for IT shippers: they were forced to take the IT gas out (about 800 mmcf) by today, so more gas may go in in the next few days, although there is not much pace left. We will get back with a more elaborate answer later this morning.

Janine - 

I would like to go to AEP on the 7th.  Their egos may not allow them to negotiate as fairly with me at the table (due to wholesale side) but I really need to get in front of these utilities in person to understand what obstacles we will face in the physical delivery world.   

I am still a novice on these issues but I would like to achieve the folloowing on the physical side, some of which may already exist.  Your comments would be helpful.

Ability to aggregate customers into pool so that we can serve hourly load more effectively
Would like for AEP to review our aggregated customer list and provide us with day ahead and hourly load forecasts so that we know how many Mw to deliver each hour
Pre-determined energy imbalance service 
Pre-determined ancillary fees
Pricing Incentives for us to serve more load
Basic walk-through of standard protocol necessary to serve load physically

These are my quick thoughts.  Kevin, do you have any further thoughts.

Thanks,
Rogers

AEP has agreed to meet with us to discuss providing us with wholesale generation.  The meeting is tentatively set for June 7th.  They would like an itemized list or agenda of what we want to discuss so that they can have the right people present.  Andy Patterson, who handles AEP's retail market activity transferred the matter to George Rooney in Marketing and Origination.

	Enron Recruitment Technology is launching a new, easy to use, web-based Employee Referral Program.

	This new site will help you to help Enron find the talent it needs. Referrals are one of the best sources of talent for Enron in terms of quality and fit with Enron's culture. We have found that referrals stay with the company longer and adapt faster than those hired through other sources. This site will help us run a world-class employee referral program with less work and better results. 

	There are also incentives for you. If you refer a candidate who is hired, you could be eligible to receive a cash reward of up to $5,000.

	So help someone accelerate their career, make yourself some money, and help us realize our mission of being the World's No. 1 Company.

	Check out the site - http://enron.referrals.com/promo.asp - let us know what you think -- we want to hear from you. This application should make referring easier for you so if you have suggestions that would enhance the program, send us an e-mail (Referral.Station@enron.com) or contact the Referral Station at (713) 345-3254, option 2.

	David Oxley

Mallik -

How are we accounting for the consumption risks associated with the fact that we have in most cases no real time meter reading capabilities necessary to accurately forecast and serve load physically.

As I see it, our consumption premiums appear to be very simplistic calculations (100 basis point type calcs on generic rate class profiles)  and do not take into acount the aforementioned metering shortfalls.  This issue is exacerbated when trying to reconcile/prove DSM performance.

I would like to think about and discuss in more detail to ensure appropriate risk capture.  

Rogers

Subject: Enron Announces Plans to Merge with Dynegy

Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.

I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.

And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.

Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The information provides further details about:

	-- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge;
	-- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of     three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications;
	-- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties; 
	-- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and
	-- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees.

This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.  As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.  

Restatement of Earnings

Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:

Net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include:

	-- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997
	-- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998
	-- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999 
	-- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000
	-- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001 
	-- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001
	-- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001.  

The consolidation of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.

The restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the nine-month period ending September 2001.

You can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the Form 8-K filing at <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/>.

We will continue to review our strategic, operational and financial position, and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments.

I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

Louise and John:

Please note that starting from 5/21/2001 the west desk will start publishing the West and Canada VaR report onto Executive Report Viewer.  IT and Risk Control are working on getting west gas positions set up for the report and getting all VaRs calcuated for all books with positions.  As soon as the set up is accomplished, we will start presenting complete data on the intranet.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Fran Chang

Sources have conducted the following "off-the-record" interview with a BC Hydro executive.  

Executive Summary
BC Hydro projected capacity 
BC Hydro/Liberal Government's export policy
BC Hydro expanded capacity projects

BC Hydro Capacity
The individual stated that BC Hydro is convinced it has sufficient capacity to supply British Colombia through 2005, even if faced with increasing demand from business expansion.  He stated that BC Hydro's long-term contracts to supply power to the grid in the Western US amounted to only 1% of BC Hydro's capacity.  Therefore, the company likely would continue to be active in the spot market through Powerex, the company's "main revenue generator."  For example, according to a company report, BC Hydro benefited from a revenue increase of $2.876 billion Canadian for the first 9 months of fiscal 2001, largely due to spot market trading.

BC Hydro Exports
BC Hydro feels the new Liberal government likely will "make a concerted effort to expand capacity" in British Colombia. Likewise, since the Liberal government will be "business-oriented," the BC Hydro official expects the government to promote increased exports of power to the US.  However, the individual cautioned that there would likely be a public relations battle on this point, as "people don't necessarily favor increasing capacity to produce energy for export."  This is due to broad-based environmental opposition to building more plants.  Therefore, in the long-term BC Hydro's new projects will favor "green alternatives" such as dam expansion and biomass, thermal and solar plants over gas-fired plants.

The spokesman stated that the Liberal Party intends to go forward with its campaign promise to remove BC Hydro's monopoly on power.  If and when this happens, relations between the company and the government are expected to "quickly sour."

BC Hydro Capacity Projects
BC Hydro is pursuing a number of new projects to expand/improve generation capacity, including:
Seven-Mile Dam -- BC Hydro will likely add a 213 MW turbine to the 3 units already in place
Revelstoke Dam -- BC Hydro is "looking very seriously" at adding a 500 MW unit to the 4 units already in place.  There is also the potential to add a 5th 500 MW unit, though this is not being considered at this time.
Site C Dam -- A plan for a 960 MW dam was shelved in the 1980s due to environmental concerns, but now appears to once again be a "viable option." Though BC Hydro reportedly has no definite plans to pursue this option at this time, the individual said that constructing the dam would be more valuable now than it was in the 1980s, and that resurrecting the plan would be a BC Hydro decision.
Burrard Thermal Plant - BC Hydro has invested $250 million to upgrade generation systems to reduce emissions.

Calpine has bought a 240 MW gas-fired co-generation plant called Campbell River on Vancouver Island.  This plant is "in the final stages of testing and is already generating."  Calpine plans to bring the plant online commercially "in the next few weeks."  BC Hydro will buy power from the plant for use on Vancouver Island. This is part of a plan to make Vancouver Island self-sufficient in electricity.  Another "key plank" in this plan is the Port Alberni plant, a 250 MW, independently-owned plant that is being sold to BC Hydro.  The plant reportedly will be online in two years and will supply Vancouver Island.

All,

Don confirmed this morning that we do in fact want to move all members of the contract review team working on this full time to a new cost center.  I would like to effect that July 1, 2001, so we should finally identify that team by the end of next week.

Berney, since Don is out the first part of next week, can you copy the group back on the last round of identified people that you and Misty put together and highlight the full time people that should be in this cost center.  This will be an Enron Americas cost center , rolling up in the risk management group of cost centers under Don and Rogers direction.

Thanks

Wade

I think we should install 15 minute metering capability and start serving these customers physically.   In order to grow this business, we need to find out if we can serve retail load directly in an efficient and cost-effective manner.   The quicker we can achieve physical delivery capability, the quicker we can define our true cost of serving these customers.

John, 

After your conversation with Paul yesterday, we have evaluated the option of moving all of GAS and POWER next weekend, we will be able to move everyone in a single move, however we will need a firm commitment by midday Tuesday, in order for us to get the workforce, move the broker lines and all the other tasks associated with this scale of move.

If you would like to proceed, please let me or Bill Donovan know as soon as practicable, so we can facilitate the migration. 

If we do not move next weekend, this will cause real problems with the resources and contracts in place, staff and suppliers are on vacation through thanksgiving and the move data will soon be out of date which will need to be reconciled which would increase the cost.


Martin Bucknell

9.=09MINORITY INTERESTS

=09Enron consolidates a limited partnership (the Limited Partnership), for =
which the consolidated third party's ownership interest is reflected in min=
ority interests on Enron's balance sheet in the amount of $691 million at S=
eptember 30, 2001.  The Limited Partnership assets include a $690 million n=
ote payable from Enron and certain merchant investments, both domestic and =
international.  Enron anticipates the receipt of $250 million from the sale=
 of one of the Limited Partnership's investments, a local gas distribution =
company in Brazil, upon the closing of the sale which is pending certain re=
gulatory and other approvals.  Enron may be required to use the net proceed=
s upon the closing of the sale, or a portion thereof, to repay a portion of=
 the note payable. =20

=09The November 12, 2001 downgrade in Enron's senior unsecured debt rating =
to BBB- by Standard & Poor's has caused a ratings event related to the Limi=
ted Partnership.  This ratings event started a nine business day period dur=
ing which Enron has the right, until November 26, 2001, to either post an u=
nsecured letter of credit equal to Enron's note payable, repay the note pay=
able with the Limited Partnership investing such proceeds in permitted inve=
stments, or to purchase the investors' interest in the Limited Partnership.=
  To the extent that Enron does not satisfy this requirement by November 26=
, 2001, the investors have the right to immediately begin to liquidate the =
Limited Partnership assets.  Additionally, as a result of the rating downgr=
ade, the investors, subject to certain actions, are able to accelerate and =
assign the note payable.  Consistent with the restructuring plan discussed =
in Note 2, Enron is currently working with the lenders to develop a mutuall=
y acceptable amendment or waiver to the transaction documents in order to a=
void an early Enron payment obligation. =20

=09Either as a result of the restructuring plan discussed in Note 2 or to r=
aise cash to repay Enron's obligation discussed above, Enron may sell the L=
imited Partnership assets for amounts below their carrying values.  The net=
 proceeds from the sale of such assets can be used to repay Enron's obligat=
ion.  Accordingly, Enron may be required to record asset writedowns, possib=
ly as early as the fourth quarter of 2001.

=09It is not possible to predict whether Enron will be able to favorably co=
mplete the actions described above.  In the event that Enron fails to pay a=
ny debt obligations when due, including when such obligations may be accele=
rated, or is unable to refinance or obtain a waiver of its obligation, a se=
ries of events would begin which could impact Enron's compliance with the t=
erms of its Revolving Credit Agreements and certain other obligations, incl=
uding bank debt facilities. =20

John,

In reviewing the remaining schedule C, I feel comfortable releasing the Green Mountain reserve of $2.09 MM. It was held back as we waited for the development of an hourly market and an ancillary market. I feel that the inherent risk associated with the ancillaries can be captured in the curves now that we have seen a market for 3 months. The scalar risk can be reflected in the hourly scalars. As for the QSE default exposure, I am willing to absorb it in my book.

Please let me know if you have any questions,

Doug

Subject:	Final Commission Decision on Rate Design

At the continuation meeting held this afternoon, the Commission voted out
the Alternate Proposed Decision on SCE/PG&E rate design.  The vote was 3 to
2, with Bilas and Duque voting "no".

Absent a close reading (which I have not had the opportunity to do yet), it
is difficult to discern all the changes made to the alternate as it was not
put out in a red-lined form.  While the version voted out today contains a
lot more verbiage supporting the previously made resolutions of the issues,
the only real substantive changes made appear to be (1) it lowers the cap on
agricultural customers rate increases from 30% to 20% for agricultural TOU
customers, and to 15% for agricultural non-TOU customers; and (2) it places
an average rate increase cap on industrial customers.  For PG&E, this
average rate increase cap is 12.3 cents/kWh; for SCE its $12.9 cents/kWh.
The decision does not contain alot of explanation on the industrial cap.  I
am assuming that the "average rate increase" refers to the average across
TOU periods.

I will review the Decision more closely, providing a complete summary
tomorrow.  In the mean time, if you have any questions, please call.

Jeanne Bennett

John:

Camargo Correa is a construction company in Brazil who recently received an allocation of energy from a plant as a bonus for early completion of the hydro facility.  The plant is located in the south, but the company thought that they could deliver energy in the southeast due to a regulatory exception.  Last week, we offered them a R$80/MWhr floor in exchange for 50% of the spot price upside above the floor (11 months out of Feb 02) or a fixed price of R$110/MWhr for approximately 100 average MWs.  This was the best offer they received, but have since come back stating that they can only deliver in the south.  We revised our offer for the south to R$70 and R$110 for the floor and fixed price respectively.  We are seeing some politics creep into the deal and I think the probability is decreasing.

John and Louise,

After Saturday's meeting, Tim and I felt we should more concisely describe our thoughts on Bonus Plan and Key Employee Retention.  There is a lot of angry noise in Portland, but we believe that a plan similar to the attachment would work here.  We have not discussed this with the other Saturday participants.  We are prepared to discuss at your convenience.

Regards,

Chris

Janie Tholt called Dynegy because of the .12 cent spread between SJ EOL and SJ ICE.  The Trader at Dynegy said that they were busy training two schedulers to trade cash, and that arbing the market was not the message they wanted to send to them.  They would like to focus on the "Big Picture" instead.  

We tried.

John,

I hate to whine, but...

EES:
Duran and I talked with Delainey yesterday.  It seems as though we are setting up one centralized trading/risk function but we will have overlapping origination functions.  I am sure I can work with whatever arrangement you make with Dave, but it seems as though we will be tripping over each other in the market.  Industrial coverage seems easy, but they want to call on IOU's and Munis in order to buy customers.  These are fundamentally large, structured short positions that are very similar to what we have been and are pitching.  

Transport/Operations:  
Eric Gadd came back from London and reports to Stan Horton.  He heads up an Asset Development group that is focusing on, among other things, power plant development in the southwest.  This sounds crazy - do you want to call Stan or should I?

Portland General:
They are developing generation in Oregon that is competing with one of our projects.  No one in RAC has heard of this yet.  Not a big deal, I will call Peggy Fowler, but thought you should be aware.

Regards,

Chris

We need to talk about his.  I've gone through several "wish lists" with them and received little or nothing back.  In one case, a project of theirs was giving out wrong information.  I shared my blunt thoughts with them today as they asked me for my latest wish list.  They couldn't give me a succinct, definitive status on my previous wish list, so I told them to finish or terminate all of the old stuff before we talk about new stuff.  

Since I never receive a price signal from these guys I have no idea what they are spending money on and who it is supposed to benefit.  I am currently receiving promises with no effective project management and little or nothing of value to show from their efforts on projects I have requested.

Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview =
of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter=
ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit=
y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=
ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot =
of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=
re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu=
rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve=
r imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=
ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=
tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=
vestor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=
stand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=
iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=
usly reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three=
 areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=
nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th=
ese include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=
r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti=
me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering=
 these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=
.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =
of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =
concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=
mprovement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=
ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the=
 return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =
that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash=
 that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre=
ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th=
ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN=
G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=
s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale=
 is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga=
s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev=
eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete=
rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff=
icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make=
 reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b=
ecomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that =
our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba=
lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr=
edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       "Under Review for Further Downgrade"

-- Fitch at BBB-             "Evolving Status"

-- S&P at BBB-              "CreditWatch Negative"

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin=
 and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1=
0-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. =
19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we=
ll as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference =
call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next =
few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/inve=
stors under "SEC Filings."

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a =
joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commissio=
n. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint pro=
xy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes=
 available, because it will contain important information. Investors and se=
curity holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospect=
us (when it is available) and other documents containing information about =
Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Cop=
ies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will b=
e incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may als=
o be obtained for free by directing a request to either: Investor Relations=
, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) =

ilding, 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 853-3956, Fax: (=
713) 646-3302.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be consi=
dered "participants in the solicitation" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders i=
n connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their d=
irect or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are availab=
le in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

Fines:

     I know you have talked with Phillip but I wanted to give my two cents.  I think the fines are a great idea. We must be accountable for VAR.  However the fines do not allow the desks to push the envelope.  The desks need to stay a couple million under VAR to protect against volatility and factor changes.  We do not have the tools to predict our VAR with any strong degree of accuracy but we are penalized for going over a few hundred thousand dollars.  I propose a one day grace period of 10% to 12% over limit.  This would allow the desks to max their VAR and protect against unexpected changes.

EOL:

We continue to have trouble with brokers not working our EOL numbers.

We believe Dynegy has written a program to mirror our cash markets on their system. When we suspend, they suspend and as our markets move, so do theirs.

Subject:	Wartsila USA

Richard,

This is the e-mail you forwarded back in February.  I have chased up all of the guys in the US and here's the scoop:

ENA
Spoke with Bob Virgo who is a John Chappell equivalent, working for Dave Duran
They looked hard at the Wartsila engines back in March and concluded that it would not work due to emissions problems - they were considering the sites from all over the US
They haven't spoken with Wartsila for over a month
No wonder why Dave Duran hasn't rushed to call me back

EES
Spoke with Jeff Golden who is VP Corporate Development and acting as deal leader for distributed generation projects
They have spoken with Wartsila only generally about a deal
EES is trying to create optionality for its originators by pre-permitting some sites in New Mexico (x 2), Arizona (x 2) and Nevada (x 5)
Each site would be suited for 10 - 50 MW... therefore 70 - 350 MW total
They looked at a 2-4 year lease option with Wartsila starting this summer but it likely won't happen - can't get the sites permitted in time
Jeff didn't think there was anything that would cause Wartsila to conclude that the US deal was immenent
Jeff was interested in co-ordinating our efforts and wants to discuss the merits of a global deal - I will be sending him a copy of our Wartsila term sheet

Spoke with Mark Dobler who is VP Operations
confirmed that Jeff is the man to talk to in EES
sentiment in EES is that they are no big time bullish about getting into physical positions to cover off California - thinks the Sol Cal Edison credit problem will be solved by the government
heard that one of the EES guys in Brazil (Tony Spruill) is looking at generation to cover off some positions - another potential for a global deal

Conclusion
>From Enron USA's perspective there is no burning deal for Wartsila kit

Interesting feedback considering this morning's conversation...

Regards,

Chris

Subject:	Re: Mobile DG Sets   

We are in negotiations with Wartsila, a maker of 3MW gas recip engines, that gives us access to up to 700MW of engines over a 5 year time frame (including some very nice optionality).  An important feature is that we think we can mark to market the tolling contracts.

Chris Thrall is the lead originator on the deal, which still has some significant hurdles to overcome.  My intention is to get this deal done, then bring North America in to the equation.  
Wartsila are a counterparty with great potential, but can be flakey, and therefore need to be handled carefully.  I will ask Chris to give you a call later today.

Regards 

Richard

Richard -  

I was referred to you by Dan Leff, who asked me to touch base on some mobile power sets you are deploying in the UK.  He indicated the number to be qty 70 10MW units.

I have the same task here in the US, specifically to take advantage of the power shortage occurring 2-3Q 2001, in multiple markets.

If you are the right contact person, can we talk on 12 Feb?  I can be reached at 713.345.5296 (office) or 713.302.3663 (cell).  If you are not the right contact person, can you forward accordingly?  Thanks for your help.

Regards
Mark

John/Louise:

Brian Stanley and I discussed his proposal to consolidate the Enron America development engineers under EEOS.  As you know, there is a lot of noise in the system with respect this topic that is detracting from productivity.  I suggest that we need to make a definite decision on whether or not the ENA Tech Services Group will be consolidated into EEOS or will they remain as a separate group under ENA.  The stakeholders in this decision include the power/gas origination teams (e.g. Duran, Jacoby, Calger, etc.) the various technical groups, and RAC.  These groups should be consulted to ensure that whatever we do meets their requirements.

I have asked Brian S. to arrange a meeting when he returns from his trip on or about June 11th (with Louise on the phone) to discuss.  This will also ensure we get past some key dates in our construction projects.

Regards,
Brian

After several very difficult weeks, Enron announced on Friday that the company has reached an agreement to merge with Dynegy.  

I know that everyone has many questions right now regarding the future of the Associate / Analyst Program.  We are working as quickly as possible with the business units and executive management to determine the future course of the Program.  As the merger points on the Enron homepage indicate (<http://home.enron.com/>), Dynegy has a similar program called "PACE", and the two companies will consider a combination of the two programs.  

Today, all of the business units within Enron will be holding floor meetings to discuss the pending merger and it's implications for Enron.  I encourage each of you to participate in one of these meetings.  

The announcement of the deal with Dynegy marks a significant event in removing some of the uncertainties we've all dealt with over the past several weeks.  As decisions are made regarding the future of the company and specific business units, we will be able to determine and communicate the future of the Program.

New opportunities will be created from the changes that are occurring.  The very best talent from both organizations will rise to the top, and our Associates and Analysts will be a key part of our future success.

I appreciate your continued efforts and patience during this difficult time.

Billy Lemmons
Vice President,  Associate / Analyst Program

Yes. The opportunities are huge, if regulations allows regulated customers to sell power. Ferro alloy and Silicon represents around 1000MW and including Aluminum and Soda around 2000MW. Mateus is talking to Valesul and, I'm talking to Alcan for their generated power, but they have shown interest to sell purchased power. I've been talking (with Fred) also to ferro-alloy and silicon producers that are interested as well.

Remi

Things are changing.
This issue is still under discussion and the new proposed measures allow consumers to sell to generators, distributors and traders.
If this happens, their price is going to raise to MAE price (or close to). The main issue now is "Is MAE goig to start settling?".
I'll keep informing you guys.

Subject:	Re: mae measures   

That's one of the topics I wanted to address PRIORITARILY this afternoon.  According to Luis Otavio and Fred, customers A (alta tens?o, and demand greater than 2.5MW) will ONLY be allowed to sell "excess power" not consumed (capped at their "cota" or "meta" or quota) to OTHERS CONSUMERS, but not to MARKETERS.  The reason for this is that ANEEL/Parente don't want to "flood" MAE with positions to settle (the argument is, if MAE cannot manage 67 counterparties, they won't be able to manage several hundreds).  But it's crazy: all unbalanced (net) positions will be settled in spot market: if marketers are not allowed to act as intermediaries, there will be hundreds of net, bilateral positions to settle (and it WILL flood MAE), if marketers like Enron can be in the middle they will net themselves all positions on portfolio basis and they will show only ONE position in MAE.

This mechanism is no different from the often discussed concept of DEMAND SIDE MANAGEMENT.  The only way to make it work is to allow LIQUIDITY and therefore competition and therefore Marketers. 

It is vital that Marketers be authorized to acquire and sell this power, and settle their net position (net position only) in spot market.  EOL will be a great tool for this, and we may accelerate its launch in Brazil with this new, different product ("Restricted Power")

Subject:	mae measures

One of the proposals under review with the Apag?o team is to allow the B and A costumers to access the Mae and transact their "contracted energy" after their respective 20-25% reduction targets.  The MAE and the distributors do not have the systems in place to deal  with over 1,800,000 customers in the entire system. Elektro alone has close to 150000 customers in this class.    This can be a tremendous oportunity for Enron on Line to take off.  Remi could you review and prepare an action plan urgently.  These measures are targeted to be released next week.

Hey!  Hope you're doing well and getting some sleep.  John asked me to send you an e-mail concerning the move of Dick Lydecker under the Wholesale investing effort headed by Kevin Garland.  I have attached the April assets listing for your reference.  It was John's sense that he would want to place certain assets under Dick which aren't currently his, such as AIG and maybe even Bridgeline.  We should probably make some cut that could be different than the existing owners. Other  Investments of note:  Onondaga
                                All of Mike Miller's stuff( I assume including Destec)
                                Some of Redmond's retained assets (see p. 4)
                                East Coast Power loan --  $30mm 
                                All of the CLO Investments

These would all be candidates to move some of which might land with Dick anyway.  I think John just wanted you thinking about this.  Call me if you have thoughts or need further info.  By the way, I scanned other B/S accounts and nothing exists there which should be moved

I agree with Remi.
Only comment I would add, and I made it to Mauro Arce in Brasilia, is that those transactions should be ex-post, decreasing the risk o default in MAE.

Subject:	Re: mae measures   

That's one of the topics I wanted to address PRIORITARILY this afternoon.  According to Luis Otavio and Fred, customers A (alta tens?o, and demand greater than 2.5MW) will ONLY be allowed to sell "excess power" not consumed (capped at their "cota" or "meta" or quota) to OTHERS CONSUMERS, but not to MARKETERS.  The reason for this is that ANEEL/Parente don't want to "flood" MAE with positions to settle (the argument is, if MAE cannot manage 67 counterparties, they won't be able to manage several hundreds).  But it's crazy: all unbalanced (net) positions will be settled in spot market: if marketers are not allowed to act as intermediaries, there will be hundreds of net, bilateral positions to settle (and it WILL flood MAE), if marketers like Enron can be in the middle they will net themselves all positions on portfolio basis and they will show only ONE position in MAE.

This mechanism is no different from the often discussed concept of DEMAND SIDE MANAGEMENT.  The only way to make it work is to allow LIQUIDITY and therefore competition and therefore Marketers. 

It is vital that Marketers be authorized to acquire and sell this power, and settle their net position (net position only) in spot market.  EOL will be a great tool for this, and we may accelerate its launch in Brazil with this new, different product ("Restricted Power")

One of the proposals under review with the Apag?o team is to allow the B and A costumers to access the Mae and transact their "contracted energy" after their respective 20-25% reduction targets.  The MAE and the distributors do not have the systems in place to deal  with over 1,800,000 customers in the entire system. Elektro alone has close to 150000 customers in this class.    This can be a tremendous oportunity for Enron on Line to take off.  Remi could you review and prepare an action plan urgently.  These measures are targeted to be released next week.

Attached is the Elektro weekly report as well as a summary update of the rationing action plan and state of affairs ( although it is Portuguese it gives you an idea of the effort that is going into the detailed planning and implementation). 
 The last two weeks were continuous negotiations with the government regarding rationing implementation measures, including drafting provisory measures that have force of law as well as resolutions to implement  them. 
I have met on a daily basis with Minister Parente in Brasilia and we continue to lead the sector efforts  advocating  our rights under the concession contracts, as well as the initial contracts signed with the government owned generators.  Sergio Assad is focusing on the implementation and  legal aspects of the measures.  Jo?o Carlos is focusing on the MAE ( energy market ) intervention and energy contracts. 

On Friday I met  with Pedro Malan, Minister of Fazenda, Brasil's most powerfull minister and possible presidential candidate in the 2002 elections,  to discuss Enron's and sector positions regarding the current situation and solutions for the path forward. On Monday I am meeting with Arminio Fraga, Central Bank President and in a separate meeting with Octavio Castello Branco, BNDES, Brazilian national development bank director, who is heading the multi-ministerial task force focused on resolving  pending issues regarding the thermal expansion program.  In all these meetings we are discussing the Cuiaba situation as well as our other projects and investment possibilities, stressing the necessary solutions to our existing issues as a condition precedent to further investment.   

The government has given this agenda top priority, especially due to the political/economic implications and the presidential elections in 2002, which will be in serious jeopardy for the President's party if the power shortages extend into next year.  We are focusing on implementing measure that protect our investments and create conditions for a competitive energy market.   

I will keep updating as we progress

Executive Summary:

Legislators in both parties are scared about a fiscal meltdown and looking for a realistic Plan B
The Keeley plan is the most likely vehicle and would include the 30% generator haircuts and revenue bonds backed by a dedicated rate component
Despite uncertainty over dealing with transmission lines and continued oppostion from Burton and his consumer group allies, the Keeley plan will probably pass the legislature
The generators will not support the plan until they get clearer guarantees from the state that investigations and lawsuits will end
PG&E could get the same offer as SoCal through the bankruptcy court.

1.	Budget Binge Could Scare Legislators into a Deal

According to sources, the Assembly is "terrified"  of the current holes in the budget due to buying power.  The impact of the  energy crisis is reportedly causing panic among some legislators.  This  panic appears to be moving a SoCal bailout plan forward.
 
 Sources report that a modified Plan B deal is  "not that far off"; it will likely take one to two weeks (more likely closer to  two) to move a deal through the Assembly and the Senate and to the governor's  desk once it is introduced.
 
2.	What Would the New Plan B Look Like?

- This modified Plan B deal, which  will originate in the Assembly, will almost certainly include a dedicated  rate component to pay SoCal's undercollect.  Revenue bonds will be issued  securitized by this dedicated rate component.  It is also very likely that  the generators would be offered 70 cents on the dollar for what they are owed  immediately, with the possibility of more if they win litigation.  (Sources  report that the state is "fairly confident" that at least most generators  would not be successful in winning this additional money.)  Assembly Speaker Keeley  reportedly remains the driving force behind this plan, and it is being drawn up  from within his office.
 
3.	Transmission Lines

- It remains unclear at this time whether a  transmission line purchase or option to purchase will be put into the deal,  since this is a major point of contention between the Democrats and  Republicans.  According to sources, the Assembly is "working on  this."

4.	Plan Looks Good to Pass Both Assembly and Senate 

- According to sources, the vote count for passing  a deal containing the above components (except the transmission line purchase,  which is not yet settled) "looks very good."  The vote in the Senate would  be "very close."  Senator Burton still opposes a bail-out deal, but he  reportedly might not stand in the way of others from voting for the  plan, making its passage more likely.  Even opponents of the plan  (including Burton and the consumer advocates) say that the odds of a modified  Plan B passing the Senate are better than 50-50.  These opponents are  reportedly "pessimistic" about their chances of stopping a Plan B from passing  at this point.

5.	Caveat: Generators Are Waiting For Guarantees That the Witch Hunt Will End
 
- As reported previously, sources continue to  believe that generators would be reluctant to take a 70 cent-on-the-dollar  haircut without the state offering them relief from further prosecution.   (Without this relief, the state could give them 70 cents, then try to take away  even more.)  Sources report that even opponents of the plan accept that the  generators should be offered this relief from prosecution.  Thus, it  appears likely at this time that most generators would accept a 30 percent  haircut if they were paid immediately.  Also, sources believe that the  securitization on the dedicated rate component offered in the modified Plan B  would be sufficient to pay back those generators who successfully litigated to  win more than 70 cents on the dollar.
 
- Sources believe that SoCal Edison's creditors are  likely to forebear from filing an involuntary bankruptcy long enough for this  plan to go through, since it would pay back most of what they are  owed.
 
6.	PG & E Could Also Be Dealt In
 
- If this plan succeeds, it will almost certainly  be taken to the bankruptcy court and offered to PG&E as part of a  reorganization plan.  This plan can be offered at any time within  PG&E's "period of exclusivity."  This is a 90-day period (though it is  often extended) following the filing of a bankruptcy petition.
 
- However, sources report that the state is  concerned about how to approach the bankruptcy court.  Based on Supreme  Court precedent (which legal sources within the state have been reviewing), the  state would likely lose its sovereign immunity if it entered as a party into the  bankrutpcy court.  This is a problem because the stakes in this case are so  high.
 
7.	Bailout Bill Would Require Follow Legislation For A New Rate Structure

- Even if the state passes and signs a SoCal  bailout, it would still need to pass a rate structure that would allow SoCal and  PG&E to flow through cost increases to prevent them from once again facing  bankrtupcy.  Therefore, this plan does not make the crisis go  away.

To add an element of fun to tonight's hockey,  whomever is going against Brad should "team up" and make a concerted effort to  NOT allow him to carry the puck over the blue line. If two or three guys "rush"  him, he will be forced to "dish the puck" off to a teammate, which he HATES to  do on a rush. He is not happy unless he either shoots or makes a sleek,  goal-mouth pass. His natural arrogance will force him to try to beat all those  who challenge him. If you check him or he makes a bad pass, he gets furious and  is LOTS of fun to watch.
 
I, for one, am changing teams tonight just to do  this . If I succeed only once, it will have been well worth it!
 
REGARDS,
 
Joe.

John,
Since we have been interfacing primarily with Greg on Mariner, I wanted to make sure that you were in the loop.  Greg and Bowen met with Bob Henderson on Tuesday to discuss changing the management of the asset by Enron.  The meeting apparently went well.  Greg, Jesus, Thompson, and I are meeting with Henderson tomorrow at 11:00 pm at our offices to formally introduce Thompson and me to Henderson and to discuss the process going forward.  We are moving with changing the board.  Bowen, Donahou, Detmering, and Sherrick are resigning from the board and being replaced with Greg, Thompson, Keel, and me through a process of unanimous written consent.  The board restructure will hopefully be accomplished tomorrow or Friday.    

I will keep you posted.
Scott

John

fyi - I'll call him this afternoon/evening and get his feedback and work with Kim on getting him in to close this down - Whalley has asked to meet him when he comes in.

Do you want to see him again ?

	I had a great visit with Eddie Rietze last night.  We spent about 3 hours together.  I think we should definately pursue him.
He is interested talking further.  We will probably need to meet with him during the evening.  Please let me know if I need to do 
anything to proceed.  I indicated to Eddie that you would be contacting him to set an interview schedule.

thanks,

Scott

There are rumors circulating that the Associate/Analyst program will be reduced soon.  Can we address this issue with some of the Associate/Analyst employees on the floor?  Will Associates be reduced regardless of whether or not they are in a core business, etc.?

Let me know if I can address this with some of our people.

Mike

TD Waterhouse is now accepting Conditional Offers to purchase shares of DJ Orthopedics, Inc., which is expected to price on 11/14/2001.

To read the preliminary prospectus filed with the SEC and place a Conditional Offer, follow these steps:
- Login to your account
- Click on Trading > IPO Center > IPO Offerings

In the list of Current Offerings, select the offering you want and then click on the "Continue" button.

Important Information - Reaffirming Your Conditional Offer

Once the registration statement is declared effective by the SEC, we will contact you via e-mail to notify you of the effectiveness of the registration statement and the price as determined by the managing underwriter. This normally occurs on the day prior to the first day of trading.

If you still wish to participate, you will be required to respond to us by 3:00 am ET of the following business day to reaffirm your previously submitted Conditional Offer. Please note that the e-mail notification will likely be sent after the market closes. Please ensure that you have provided an
e-mail address that you are able to access after that time. You may change your e-mail address at anytime via the "Update E-mail" function within the IPO Center.

If it is not possible to check your e-mail after market hours, you may reaffirm your Conditional Offer following effectiveness by going to the "IPO Order Status" within the IPO Center, choosing the Conditional Offer you want to reaffirm, and clicking "Reaffirm Conditional Offer".

If you fail to reaffirm your Conditional Offer within the specified period, your Conditional Offer will automatically be cancelled.

Conditional Offers are accepted once reaffirmed, at the offering price, determined by the managing underwriter after the registration statement becomes effective.

Please note that reaffirming a Conditional Offer does not guarantee an allocation of shares.

Thank you,

TD Waterhouse Investor Services, Inc.
Member NYSE, SIPC.

PLEASE TREAT AS CONFIDENTIAL

A source had a meeting today with California state treasurer Phil Angelides.  Here are the main points from their conversation

1.	Anglelides Certain that SoCal Will Go Bankrupt

Corroborating our line over the past four months, Anglelides stated with confidence that SoCal would go bankrupt and that "he was surprised they hadn't already."  He noted that the only reason they haven't yet is that "they were too stupid to ring-fence the parent" and that "their two biggest equity holders were screaming not to do it."

He added that the Davis/SoCal MOU is dead and that all the "Plan B's" are "speculative" at best.  He also thought that SoCal was being "naive if they thought they would get a better deal from the legislature than from the bankruptcy court."

2.	Bond Issuance- $12B Not Enough

Angelides conceded that a $12B bond issue would not be enough to buy power for the summer and that the true costs would probably be $18-24B.   The only reason they didn't issue more is that Angelides felt that "$12B was all the market could handle."  The current game plan for bonds assumes an average peak price for power of $400/MWh, which Angelides said explains the difference between his estimates and the higher estimates from State Comptroller's Kathleen Connell's office.

3.	New Generator Construction

Anglelides was explicit that the California Public Power Authority (authorized by the legislature last week) will "build plants and not stop until we [California] has a 10-15% capacity cushion above expected demand.  Angelides expects the state to be "5-10% short on power all summer."

- No significant change in margin or hotlist summary

Las Vegas:  Allegheny, Black Hills, Northland Power are on dealbench reviewing data, info memo and purchase and sale agreement.  
Process: review docs and data, visit site, negotiate purchase and sale - still on track for June 30 signing and August 31 funding.

Roseville: Exercised option for $6MM of ERC's from Georgia Pacific.  Working on development agreement and initial CEC application.

AMPS: Last week received complete emissions data on units.  Pursuing deals to install, sell or lease first 2 units.  Most likely structure: Site owner contributes site and pays 20% of costs and get 20% of margin associated with selling energy into merchant market.  Currently in discussion with 6 industrials and 8 utilities.  Oregon Steel is in the lead - they are spending $ on permitting and engineering at their site in Portland (unfortunately the site is near my house so I may protest!).

Blue Dog: $3.5MM of income recognition for turbine sale has moved to Q2 from Q3.

Tolls to Generators: Reliant did not lift our 100MW Mid-C offer. but they are still working on it - they had VAR constraints.  We are also showing synthetic tolls to other generators that expressed interest in our LV toll:  Duke, Constellation, Cinergy, NRG, Dynegy and Allegheny.  While these companies lead with assets, they also have trading functions that seem willing to get long through a PPA.

DWR: Still working through credit and financial info.  Their bid is still there and in the money, but has fallen $2-$3/MWh due to the falling prices in the west.

Quick heads up..
We re-ran correlations for power and gas.  VAR for ERCOT drops as a result.  We have not implemented new correlations because we are still evaluating changes to GAS VAR, and credit reserve model. 
I will continue to check with Port regarding potential production date.

Word for Word [IMAGE] "I don't know. Part of me thinks the kid's right. He asks what he's done to deserve this. He wants to stay here, fine. Let's leave him and go home. But then another part of me thinks, what if by some miracle we stay, then actually make it out of here. Someday we might look back on this and decide that saving Private Ryan was the one decent thing we were able to pull out of this whole God-awful mess. Like you said, Captain, maybe we do that, we all earn the right to go home."

Now Playing: Pearl Harbor
This Summer's Most Anticipated Film [IMAGE] On a sleepy Sunday morning in December, as children played and families prayed, squadrons of Japanese warplanes screamed across the skies of a Hawaiian paradise and launched a surprise attack on the U.S. armed forces at Pearl Harbor. The infamous day that jolted America from peaceful isolationism to total war and altered the course of world history is relived in Pearl Harbor , an epic tale of patriotism, passion, and romance. Director Michael Bay's ambitious take on the life-changing events surrounding December 7, 1941, focuses on the war's devastating impact on two daring young pilots (Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett) and a beautiful, dedicated nurse (Kate Beckinsale). It's this summer's biggest movie event. Now playing.

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Ken Lay

John,

It is not relevant that it is not standard practice within ETS to grant origination for closed deals.  On ECF's behalf, Bilberry and Hilgert negotiated a storage transaction that brings significant value to your business for which they should be appropriately compensated and rewarded. Also, the PRC process within business units is often not an appropriate mechanism to validate a person's P&L for transactions closed across business subsidiaries of Enron.  

The value associated with the storage transaction was indeed a significant component of P&L to the overall Formosa deal.  I do not understand how you could infer that the deal was worth over $50 million to Enron.  At best, the current value of the closed transaction across EGM, ECF and ENA is under $10 million.  In addition, EGM did compensate Bilberry and Hilgert for their origination efforts associated with the unwind of the TEPPCO contract and incremental transportation volumes from Williams.

I certainly hope we can work out this P&L issue to incentive employees to work on transactions across business lines.

Regards, Jean

Jean,

It is not standard practice within ETS to "grant origination" in the form of specific monetary awards for specific projects/deals.  The individual's achievements are incorporated into the overall PRC and of course, appropriate rewards/promotions would flow from that process.  Messrs Bilberry and Hilgert indicated that the overall deal was worth over $50 MM to Enron.  The value of the Formosa storage transaction would be a very small part of that total.  Surely any specific grants that ENA wished to make could be amply supported by the larger value that would accrue directly to ENA.

John,

Thank you for noticing the sucess that both Chris Hilgert and Mike Bilberry had in negotiating and closing the many complex contract arrangements between numerous parties in order to get the Formosa deal executed.  I am also happy that Clean Fuels is pleased with their new long term storage arrangement with Formosa and am sure it will create much value for your organization.  As such, I am assuming that you plan to grant origination to Chris and Mike to compensate them for their time and negotiations with Formosa on ECF's behalf.  Please contact me regarding the number you would like to propose.

Chris has worked on a presentation for ECF on this transaction and I will be reviewing it today.

Regards, Jean Mrha

Congratulations on closing the deal with Formosa, TEPPCO, et al.  It sounds like it was a very complex negotiation with a number of different players.  

Clean Fuels is certainly pleased with the new long term storage arrangement with Formosa.  We will begin working with them to better define the operating parameters (timing, pressures, volumes, etc) so we can develop the specific facility plans and cost estimates as necessary. 

You had also mentioned that you might be willing to share the management presentation that was put together for this deal?  That would be very interesting reading and I would appreciate a copy if possible. 

Thanks again,  John Goodpasture

TD Waterhouse is now accepting Conditional Offers to purchase shares of Weight Watchers, which is expected to price on 11/14/2001.

To read the preliminary prospectus filed with the SEC and place a Conditional Offer, follow these steps:
- Login to your account
- Click on Trading > IPO Center > IPO Offerings

In the list of Current Offerings, select the offering you want and then click on the "Continue" button.

Important Information - Reaffirming Your Conditional Offer

Once the registration statement is declared effective by the SEC, we will contact you via e-mail to notify you of the effectiveness of the registration statement and the price as determined by the managing underwriter. This normally occurs on the day prior to the first day of trading.

If you still wish to participate, you will be required to respond to us by 3:00 am ET of the following business day to reaffirm your previously submitted Conditional Offer. Please note that the e-mail notification will likely be sent after the market closes. Please ensure that you have provided an
e-mail address that you are able to access after that time. You may change your e-mail address at anytime via the "Update E-mail" function within the IPO Center.

If it is not possible to check your e-mail after market hours, you may reaffirm your Conditional Offer following effectiveness by going to the "IPO Order Status" within the IPO Center, choosing the Conditional Offer you want to reaffirm, and clicking "Reaffirm Conditional Offer".

If you fail to reaffirm your Conditional Offer within the specified period, your Conditional Offer will automatically be cancelled.

Conditional Offers are accepted once reaffirmed, at the offering price, determined by the managing underwriter after the registration statement becomes effective.

Please note that reaffirming a Conditional Offer does not guarantee an allocation of shares.

Thank you,

TD Waterhouse Investor Services, Inc.
Member NYSE, SIPC.

Rogers,

You are right. Historically, the consumption risk calculations have been too simplistic and did not distinguish between different structures and markets. Ideally, we would have tools that would enable us to quantify consumption exposure at portfolio level and take appropriate hedge positions (to the extent hedgeable). Then we would price the next deal based on the marginal risk added to existing portfolio. 

In deregulated markets, we would be subject to the consumption risk at the smallest trading block level (hourly).  The key is to understand how the combined portfolio of all deals within a given market behaves at the hourly level (as reflected by the metering shortfalls). Since both load and prices can be volatile at hourly scale, this clearly is our biggest problem. Unfortunately, currently the data & systems issues prevent us from implementing portfolio level exposure analysis. To understand this issue better, I wanted to study how our CA portfolio behaved historically.  To this end,  I have asked IBM to query CSC database to get historical hourly aggregate load for CA. I am also working with Power Desk to understand and interpret imbalance charges for the same period. Will keep you and Don posted on this.

Luckily, for regulated market areas, we have to deal only with monthly imbalances at reasonably stable tariff structures. Risk for these areas would be much smaller than the deregulated markets. But clock is ticking away as a number of states are set to deregulate soon. There are other related fundamental "Site Profile" issues (such as load profiling, and rate schedule selection) that need to be addressed as well, as most of our consumption risk issues start from the pre-contract pricing stage.

Until this portfolio issues are figured out, I agree with you in that some rational pricing approach needs to be established. In fact, we are already working closely with Research (Krishna Rao) to build deal-by-deal pricing models. However, this would create a new problem as these pricing models tend to be simulation driven and pricing each deal can be cumbersome. At this point, we are considering building models by market areas - structure combinations to issue standard pricing guidance.

For the last few weeks I have been trying to get a handle on all these issues and come up with a plan to address them. This plan will cover above issues in some detail. I am eager to get yours and Don's feedback / guidance on the plan.  As per our discussion last week, I am actually preparing a presentation for John, Don and you to outline the plan. I will bring the draft for our meeting with Sean tomorrow, if you prefer.

Mallik -

How are we accounting for the consumption risks associated with the fact that we have in most cases no real time meter reading capabilities necessary to accurately forecast and serve load physically.

As I see it, our consumption premiums appear to be very simplistic calculations (100 basis point type calcs on generic rate class profiles)  and do not take into acount the aforementioned metering shortfalls.  This issue is exacerbated when trying to reconcile/prove DSM performance.

I would like to think about and discuss in more detail to ensure appropriate risk capture.  

Rogers

John,

If you need room in your special "Top 50 Bonus" and if you think we will have bonuses under the ordinary program there is no need to include Mike Mcdonald and Steve Thome right now.   I spoke with both of them last night and for different reasons I dont think they will revolt anytime soon.   The other guys are being bid by competition and/or they have checked with lawyers about their contracts:

Choi - 200
Rosman - 200
Parquet - 250
Thomas - 300

This implies a cash plus equity structure.  This deals with them till 1/31 after which we will need a clear 2002 bonus and retention program.

PG&E filed their Schedule F which displays its nonpriority unsecured claims.  Many of the claims were listed as unknown in amount.  The PX credit amounts were listed as disputed.   Two PX credit amounts were specified in the Schedule F:

Enron Energy Marketing      $201,964,905.64
Enron Energy Services       $ 19,737,979.97
Total disclosed PX credit   $221,702,885.61

Note that in the claims that were listed as unknown in amount, none were described as PX Credit in nature. 

Two points to be made: 1) this information is now public (but on page 5,066 of 17,096 on a CD), along with $53,985,167 in other Enron related claims, and 2) our calculation of the PX credit was $392,416,534 at the beginning of May.

Michael

As a follow up to last Thursday's lunch meeting, Scott Mills and Mary Lynn Ruffer are working with Evan Hughes to further define Option 2 that we discussed regarding the settlements function.  To recap, with that option, EWS would assume internal management of the settlements function, including managing data requirements to and from the outsource providers,  and EES would retain the service management function, defining service levels and pricing, plus serving as the interface with EES customers.  

We will review with Tim, Kevin, Don and Rogers the more detailed recommendations from this team by mid week.  Then we should have a final proposal of roles and responsibilities for EWS and EES around the settlements function before the end of this week.  

Please call me in the interim if you have any questions or suggestions.  --Sally   (x35926)

We  reached a conceptual agreement with the government representatives on Sunday night.  The main points are:  

     1. Rationing losses:   Defined methodology giving distribution companies recovery over the next 36 months of rationing losses realised   from June 01 until the end of rationing in 02. Recovery includes financial compensation. Immediate funding of 80% through BNDES, with Brazilian government funds. Loans liquidated over the 3 year period as tariff increases are realised.  Funding scheduled by December 15th.  Elektro Ebitda impact of approximately R$191million or US$ 73 million.

       2.  April/May MAE settlement :   Market will settle under current rules due to pre-rationing conditions, confirming the procedures used on Elektro's books.  Impact of approximately R$ 18 million or US$ 7 million. 

       3.  Parcel  "A" for the future:  All non-controlable costs to which LDC's are subjected to including power purchases, sector charges, are passed through to final tariffs either using a tracking account mechanism or by aligning adjustment dates with  the LDC tariff revision date.  Tracking account will be subject to financial compensation from the date costs are incurred until the effective pass through and collection , eliminating a major risk for the distribution sector. Elektro Ebitda impact  2002 forward of R$ 60 million or US$ 19 million, as had been considered in the 2002 plan.  This methodology represents major risk mitigation going forward, as the initial power supply contracts are renewed starting in 2003.

        4. Parcel A from the past:   Min Parente has agreed to the concept recovering non controllable  that were not passed through to tariffs since late 1999 using the same methodology agreed to for future recoveries and has a dedicated team from the Federal Attorney General's office targeting a final solution in ten days.    Elektro impact  is R$145 million or US$ 55 million in 2001. The proposed mechanism for recovery is after the 36 months for the rationing losses.  

We are currently finalising a memo of understanding and the government team is winding up the settlement with the generators in order to finalize the terms of the overall agreement.

Min Parente has committed to resolving the open issues affecting investors in the power sector.  These  agreements represent a major step forward, significantly improving  the value of our businesses. By  solving the pending issues for the rationing losses, thus eliminating the Annex 5 controversy the MAE should function normally, allowing us to operate Eletrobolt and settle against the pool.  

Total amounts for the sector represent about R$ 10 billion or US$3.8 billion at the current rates.  Our team has led the sector negotiations for months since the rationing, and have been instrumental in convincing the government of the need for implementing these changes.

Dave,

FYI -- I have been working with Scott Mills from Sally Beck's group developing a recommendation to improve the EES/EWS information gap that exist around billing and flash-to-actuals.  Scott and I are meeting with Sally on Monday to walk through our suggestions.

The attached chart outlines a 1st cut at functional roles and responsibilities -- Scott and I will continue to evolve that document as we dig deeper.

 

Also, our team within the Services Group has developed an initiative to anticipate the needs of EWS to get a head-start on getting EWS the information it needs.  The e-mail below outlines that agenda.  We'll change/amend that effort once EWS gives us direction on frequency/format of the information.

After we meet with Sally on Monday -- I'll give you a follow-up briefing.  If you have any question -- please give me a call.

Thanks,

Evan

Congratulations on the birth of your boy...

These must be the strangest of times for you, joyous on one hand and angry on the other.  The guys on the floor are extremely appreciative of all you have been doing for us. 

Hang in there, we will emerge from this better off.

I was going to stop by around 3:00 and get a feel for your thoughts regarding Grigsby and the West trade.  I understand Phillip is managing the trade.  Do you think you'll have a couple of minutes?

Subject:	Management Conference - Business Unit Panel


Hello All,

I'm planning the agenda for this year's Management Conference.  I've been working on the upcoming meeting since March, but as you can imagine, the direction has changed several times.  

We are delighted to have General Norman Schwarzkopf delivering a keynote address on leadership, and Gary Hamel returning to help us process the past year.  While we have arranged an all-star line up of outside speakers, we also want to focus on what is happening inside Enron.  Rather than having only one or two business presentations, Mark Frevert has opted to moderate a panel to provide a high level overview of each of our primary operating units and has selected each of you to participate.

Currently, the panel is scheduled to take place 8:00-9:30am on Friday, November 16.  Please plan to present a very high level overview of your business.  You are welcome to use PowerPoint slides, but in the interest of time, presentations must be no more than 10 minutes.  Mark will introduce each of you, interject questions, encourage interaction, and ensure we stay on time. 

Below is the proposed order for your presentations.  Regardless of your place in the rundown, you will need to be seated on stage by 7:50am and equipped with a microphone.  Because we have a full agenda that morning, we will try to begin the session promptly at 8:00am.

Stan Horton - Global Services
Louise Kitchen - Americas
John Sherriff - Europe
Mike McConnell - Global Markets
Jeff McMahon - Industrial Markets
Janet Dietrich - Retail

If you elect to use a PowerPoint presentation, please forward it to me electronically by Friday, November 9 or provide the presentation to me on CD at the Management Conference.  To ensure consistancy, I've attached a PowerPoint template that I would like you to use.  

 

Finally, Mark would like to meet with the six of you to finalize preparation for the panel at 4:00pm on Wednesday, November 14 following your arrival at the Management Conference.  The meeting will take place in the Library off the Main Lobby of the Westin La Cantera.  In the meantime, if you have any questions or need any assistance, please contact me.  I look forward to working with you.

Regards,
Terrie James

Thought you would be interested to know that Dynegy does not have a confirm group.  They do not send confirms.  They just receive them from us.  I guess that they wait for settlement to catch issues over there.  That seems fairly risky.

Subject:	PX credits & Schedule F in the PG&E bankruptcy

PG&E filed their Schedule F which displays its nonpriority unsecured claims.  Many of the claims were listed as unknown in amount.  The PX credit amounts were listed as disputed.   Two PX credit amounts were specified in the Schedule F:

Enron Energy Marketing      $201,964,905.64
Enron Energy Services       $ 19,737,979.97
Total disclosed PX credit   $221,702,885.61

Note that in the claims that were listed as unknown in amount, none were described as PX Credit in nature. 

Two points to be made: 1) this information is now public (but on page 5,066 of 17,096 on a CD), along with $53,985,167 in other Enron related claims, and 2) our calculation of the PX credit was $392,416,534 at the beginning of May.

Regards,


Michael

To be honest, I really do not think my sign off on this.  
 
It looks like the money is already mostly spent on the new design (I like it if that helps) - if you get delayed there obviously will be timing issues.  The added functionality is definitely something beneficial which we want whichever the outcome is.

I would like to move forward with what we are calling Phase III for EOL.  Most of the work is done but in this environment, I don't want to prepare to roll it out in January without your views.  However, if we are to roll it out in mid-January, we need to agree soon.
 
Richter has sent you the outline/presentation on e-mail and he and Savita and Jay can describe it all in greater detail if you like. 
 
Savita discussed the presentation and the plan with John Arnold and he is supportive of the rollout and the new look and functionality. 
 
Basically it will include a new home page and a new garden page, but the key parts are the expanded quotes screen and the order manager which are a much better use of real estate than the static Reuters content down the side (which will be put in a MyContent button).  This isn't expensive, most of the work is done anyway, but it is a new look and the quotes screen will now be expanded.
 
I think it would be positive to do.  It looks better, the Reuters content can be found in a MyContent button and we can use the entire quotes screen to enhance order flow and improve the counterparty experience.  It also shows business as usual with EnronOnline.
 
Your thoughts?

Hi,

The ICE wishes to remind all our oil customers of the changes to the WTI
swap contracts.  Below are the two previous emails delivered on that topic.

First email from Tuesday;

As discussed with the users, we have decided to replace our current WTI swap
contracts by the WTI bullet swap contracts for the first four months
forward. To avoid any confusion between the two markets, we are going to
remove the current contracts (for the first four months forward) and add the
new ones on Thursday evening. We will remove the first three monthly time
spread contracts as well. The quarterly and yearly WTI swaps contracts will
remain the same.
We will keep the WTI/Brent, the Heating oil 1st line crack, the USGC heating
oil crack, the fuel 1% NY Harbour crack, the USGC Conventional Unleaded 87
crack and the Unleaded 1st line crack markets as they are now, but we will
not have the legging functionality for the first four nearby months'
contracts.

We plan to add:
- the first four months forward contracts
- the first three time spread contracts
- the Dec Red Dec contract
These contracts will be available for trading on Friday, May 18th.

If you want to add these contracts to your portfolio:
- go to Admin / Manage Portfolios,
- select the portfolio you want to add these contracts to,
- select Oil for "Market", Crude for "Products" (or Crude Spread for the
time spread contracts) and WTI Bullet swap for "Hub".

The contract will be settled on the penultimate scheduled trading day of the
WTI light Crude futures contract as published by the NYMEX for the delivery
month.

Second email from Wednesday;

	Following the e-mail you received Tuesday concerning the new WTI
bullet swap contracts, we would like to summarize what we have done on the
ICE system Tuesday evening:

		-Deleted WTI monthly time spreads
		-Deleted WTI/Brent monthly diff spreads (spread with
legging)
		-Deleted 1% NYH Harbor Fuel Oil Crack monthly (spread with
legging)

		-Added WTI/Brent monthly diff spreads (spread with NO
legging)
		-Added 1% NYH Harbor Fuel Oil Crack monthly (spread with NO
legging)

	Unfortunately the WTI/Brent and the 1% NYH Fuel Oil Crack contracts
(with the legging functionality) have been removed from your portfolios. You
will need to add 	the first four nearby months' contracts to your
portfolios by going to Admin / Manage Portfolios / Edit your portfolio....

We would like to thank you for your support and your help.

Please do not hesitate to contact us is you have any question:

I am not sure what process is in place, but at first glance, I am not sure what this letter says, except to perhaps acknowledge that they have some reason to be concerned.

Notwithstanding the tone of the commercial discussions and negotiations to date, I am concerned that the MAC letter had an obvious purpose, which should not to be discounted.  Moreover, we cannot lose this financing, and they need to be aware that they wear the risk of improperly or capriciously declaring a MAC.

Firstly, I think we need to send a written response that, although balanced is more direct (i.e. more than a comfort letter), that makes it clear that there is no reasonable basis for a MAC, thereby putting OPIC to (polite) notice that there is risk to them in not funding.  The points need to be that the recent disclosures involving Enron are not in any event material, particularly in this case, given that they are lending against the value of the project, relative to the amount of their takeout financing and with our subdebt/equity obligation, and therefore that nothing has changed form the commitment they originally made.

Secondly, we need to eliminate this risk being deferred into the Financing Agreement by focusing carefully on, and appropriately qualifying, the reps, wars, covenants and MAC conditions embodied in the Financing Agreement, to ensure that we do not merely defer this risk to the funding date.

Finally, given that they have sent the letter and the circumstances, I think we need to be careful not to make admissions that could come back to allow them to legitimize not funding.  As such, should not our response and our meetings be clearly expressed as being on a without prejudice basis?

Peter.

John, 

As per our conversation yesterday, I suggest that we put the two trades that you closed with us in January (25 MW baseload swap, 1 year, Feb. 01 to Jan 02) back on the MTM books and give you simultaneously the opportunity to close these positions.  Our prices for  June 01 - Jan 02 swap rates are as follows:

Argentina power $18.50 - $20.40 per MWh (this is a bid-offer spread in US dollars; you are currently long)
Brazil power R$425 - R$475 per MWh (this is a bid-offer spread in reais; you are currently short);

We are also making sure that there will be no adverse tax impact for Enron.

Please let me know if you agree to close these positions.

Remi

Below are details of new plan currently being created by California State T=
reasurer Phil Angelides and supported by Sen. Burton.  The plan is in the i=
nitial stages and is not currently on any legislative fast-track.  It is al=
so not motivated by a desire to save SoCal from bankruptcy.  The creator's =
goal is to give Californians more control over their energy and electric fu=
tures as well as giving the tax/rate payers a share of the pie in return fo=
r money that has/will go to the utilities.  We will continue to monitor thi=
s plan, its supporters and progress.

Plan Z
  California State Treasurer Phil Angelides and a powerful group of legisla=
tors are finally taking action and are developing a plan to solve Californi=
a's energy crisis this summer.  The group is comprised of leftish legislato=
rs, environmental advocates, in-state energy company executives and busines=
s leaders and they are pulling together a Plan Z.  At the core of the plan =
is the recently passed authorization to erect a California Public Power Aut=
hority that issues bonds, constructs new power plants and buys up transmiss=
ion lines.  There is even talk within this group of using newly legislated =
authority to buy SoCal Edison for $3.5 billion (less than it owes) although=
 they would face huge obstacles and receive strong opposition from power co=
mpanies as well as Edison itself.
  The five-year goal is to have enough power generation capacity to guarant=
ee a 5%-15% "cushion" against energy peak demand.  Angelides and Burton wan=
t to create enough capacity to form a buyer's market.  One of the points of=
 the plan is to replace private sector generation with more public sector g=
eneration.  This plan may short-circuit private sector plans to build new p=
lants, but the state has the ability to issue $5B in revenue-backed bonds (=
in addition to the $12B rate-backed bonds).    The second key element in th=
e Angelides-Burton Plan Z is additional rate hikes for California's consume=
rs and businesses.  Although discussions are still underway between this gr=
oup and business leaders, Angelides is wanting to propose an additional 45%=
 increase in residential and commercial electricity rates, however, there i=
s immense sympathy for loading a disproportionate share of the burden on bu=
sinesses.   This increase is on top of the 50%-60% already mandated by prev=
ious PUC decisions this year.  These rate increases will do two things: sto=
p the immediate fiscal drain on the state of California and prevent emergen=
cy tax hikes (being serious considered last week). =20
  Issues to consider in regards to this plan are: (1) how much will current=
 shareholders be diluted in return for helping the utilities repay long-owe=
d debts (or what would they get if the state decided to buy up all of SoCal=
 Edison); and (2) how much will creditors have to "eat" in the legislated r=
epayment plan?   In other words how big will the equity and bond haircuts b=
e?  There is no answer to these questions right now as legislators work to =
cobble together a plan with numbers that work without triggering a massive =
and politically destructive rebellion by voters next year.

Andy-
 
All well here.  I came to St. Louis with my wife right  after graduation and started Trileaf Corporation, an engineering and  environmental consulting firm with a partner.  About 3 years ago I bought  out my partner so that he could go with his family to Amman Jordan to pursue  Christian mission work through the Southern Baptist Church.  
 
Trileaf has done better than I could have ever asked or  imagined.  We now have 3 offices - St. Louis, DesMoines, and Chicago, and  23 employees.  It has been very exciting to watch and be involved with, and  the Lord has been very good to us.
 
We have a son, Theodore, who will be six in August.   Right now we also have a foster baby staying with us who is 2 months old, and a  Japanese foreign exchange student who is 17, so it is a busy time for  us.
 
I don't know what will be next, but look forward to finding  out.  
 
Let me know what you have been up to when you get he  opportunity.
 
-Scott

Hi Kam,

This is punit ...i'm working tonite...as i hv been for the past 2 nites. The thing with checking new deals is that i finish at like 530 am and the prices get populated only by 700am or later. Also, to track them from home i spoke with an EOL rep. the other day who informed me that i could track it from my home as long as i cud get onto the internet. When i tried to do it from home i was unsuccessful and was informed that i could not unless i had the VPN software and logged in through enron and that an e-request would take at least a day to come through as long as i had my supervisor's approval.

By which time it would have been already too late. Also i have had trades, as you know, which were not mine.. on my account and am hence wary of giving anyone access to my EOL a/c to monitor my positions. The last thing i wanna do once i finish 12 hrs of working is to come back to enron to track my positions on simEOL even on off-days

I hence request you to undo the penalty for this time as i am setting up all that is needed to be done to trade from home. I guess i would have to do what needs to be done to track my positions and track the VaR positions from home, during my off-days.

Thanking you.


Regards,


Punit.

These were trades done by EOL, they have been testing the bridge to Enpower and they were killed.  If there are any other trades you don't agree with let Kimat know.  It is very important that you check your new deals daily.

hi Kam,

This is Punit. I have received this email from you but have no other earlier than this one. so when u say 'again' i dont understand. i didnt know i was in such a position and tho i tried to work this from home...i was told i wud not be able to do it unless i put in an 'e-request' which i am in the process of doing. Also i think someone else is trading off my account cos i was on leave and not scheduled to come in till 1730 today and to my surprise i find that there were trades on my account!!!

Please look into this closely including the VaR violation thing.


Thank you.


Punit.


P.S : these are the trades that popped up in my account today from nowhere. << File: notmytrades.xls.csv >>

You have exceeded your VaR limit again today.  I will be taking $100,000 from your P&L tonight.  You must decrease your position today.

On Wednesday we will be having a mini Trading Track interview session.  The quality may not resemble the first session we had but I thought it would be worth it if we can find a couple more folks to put in the program.  We will probably have a much bigger one later in the year after the new analysts and associates join.  I had a couple of observations from last time.

1.  I think we were too hard on external candidates.  There are 5 or 6 external candidates.  Remember that they don't have the Enron grounding that the internal candidates have.  Most of them are not in the Gas or Electricity industry.  Try to evaluate them on their intrinsic qualities.

2.  Some people have not thought about trading concepts and are unfamiliar with trading lingo.  That doesn't mean that they will not be good traders one day. I think we were a little biased based on someones ability to run a stack tommorrow.  

Regards

John

Sounds like a plan.  The only potential obstacle would be if timing (completion of latest funding round) necessitates recognition of gain/loss in 2Q 2001.  At this juncture, this does not appear likely, but could still happen.  We'll keep you posted.

Talked to Lavorato.  He would like to write down Syntroleum, but wait and see what the fundings bring for Dais and EnCorp.  That probably makes the most sense for me on the earnings front and provides some certainty to the valuations of those two.  Call me if you have questions.  Thanks!

Wes,

Per your request.

4Q00 gains are as follows:

Dais Analytic		$  6,850,463
EnCorp			$ 12,107,669
MTC Metering		$  1,060,606
Utiliquest (RASH)	$ 722,735 gross  ($451,79 net to ENA)

1Q01 we took no gains, but we did write down Utiliquest (per a RASH) by $3,597,735 gross ($2,248,584 net to ENA).

Please call if you have any questions (x30423).

Regards,

Kyle Kettler

WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO YOU,  there is a reason we make the comments we make and if you have a couple of hours I will be happy sit down and explain to you the lease accounting rules.  In this particular matter, we are attempting to deal with an on vs off balance sheet issue.  I realize that your commercial issues don't always work with the accounting, but in that case I would hope you would simply communicate that fact and then we could jointly decide whether we should finance this deal on balance sheet or not, given the size of opportunity you have.  By the way, have you involved Joe Deffner or Brian Kerrigan from ENA Treasury.

Matthew, with all due respect, clients will be doing business with Enron as it is indentified in the introductory paragraph and the signature block.  Indeed, as a side note, most of  the documents that I have drafted or reviewed always use some form of acronym for subsequent references to Enron.  I am indifferent, but I know that the reason our accounting brethen made that comment, as well as the other comments they often make that seem counter-intuitive, is that it facilitates their efforts in ensuring that documents reflect off-balance sheet, soft costs related rather than on-balance sheet, hard costs.  As such, I would defer to them on this issue.

Carlos, with all due respect to our Accounting brethren, from a commercial point of view, potential clients don't want to do business with EDM, they want to do business with Enron.  So, please switch the EDM thing back to Enron and everything will be fine.  

If you can initial next to Max's name to let him know you've given your approval and FAX the signature page, we can take it from there.

Thanks.

Attached is a revised version of the MOU.  The most susbtantive were the addition of a couple of new sentences in section 2.  Also, one of the comments that I got from accounting was that they prefer not to have references to Enron but an acronym instead.  Otherwise, it's fine.

John,

The rooms will be available in the morning.  One room has 2 PC's set up, a printer and a fax and a lucent phone.  The other room has 2 pc's, a polycom and a lucent phone and marker board.  The copiers on the floor are functioning.  The trading desks we discussed have live lucent phones on them and the numbers will be on the phones so they can be given out if necessary.  If we need to have pc's installed at those desks, we can do that later. 

I will walk over first thing and make sure everything is functioning and gather the phone numbers.  

Tammy

John,

I spoke with WitCapital's investment banking and equity syndication groups today regarding internet distributed IPOs.  Confirming some of our earlier research, the internet is used as one of several distribution channels for an IPO, not the sole distribution channel.  This is not to say that a 100% internet distributed IPO can not be done, however.  Although, WitCapital said they would not do one.  

WitCapital emphasized the need for a large (>50%) stock distribution to instutional investors in an IPO.  70% to 80% allocation is typical.  To this end, the bank has hired an institutional sales force, which uses the telephone rather than the internet to sell.  

In WitCapital's opinion, an IPO with 70% to 80% institutional allocation and 20% to 30% retail allocation is an optimal structure which maximizes the price obtained by the issuer.  Such higher price would presumably more than offset the higher cost of a typical IPO versus an internet distributed IPO.

In addition, WiCapital's opinion is that the liquidity and trading evironment would be healthier for a typical IPO versus an internet distributed IPO, which would give the stock support in a secondary offering whereby the issuer is unloading its holdings.

Please let me know if you would like for us to do additional research on this topic.

Regards,

Kyle Kettler

Peoples Gas has backed down from their request for a letter of credit to provide "Adequate Assurances of Payment", as stated in their tariff.  They will continue to accept a parental guaranty, which is due no later than December 3 (and which Teresa says is being processed).  The amount at issue is about $40k.

However, they are sending me a letter that will say, if there is any further downgrade in our rating, they will immediately require a l/c or cash deposit.

Attached are 3 org charts.  The first is our current structure, page 2 is what I would recommend to you and page 3 is the other practical alternative.

Please call me at 011-528-152-2401 if you have any questions.

There's no new info on my front, but I'll let you know as soon as I hear something either way.

Best regards - Max

Louise,

Tomorrow, I am flying to Buffalo, NY for Thanksgiving with my father.  As such, for the potential sale of the Napoleonville Land, Julie Gomez will sign on my behalf for LRCI Inc. after both appropriate commercial, accounting and legal parameters have been met. The status is as follows:

Texas Brine has been informed that another counterparty has presented a premium bid of $ 3 MM and has the opportunity to counter.  Texas Brine was the first counterparty to try to acquire the land at $2.35 MM.
Reliant has slowed the transaction close due to their legal changes to the "Act of Sale" document.  As such, Gerald Nemec (my legal) is reviewing the document in conjuction with our Louisiana counsel as well as other relevant internal legal groups (i.e. litigation and environmental).

I am confident that the land will get sold and was hoping to close the transaction prior to my leaving.  However, this bidding "war" has the potential for ENA to extract an even higher auction price.  The approximate book value of the land is $1.4 MM.

I can be reached via Blackberry or cell (713-302-4187).  Eva Rainer, Manager, is also an appropriate person to contact for any questions.

Regards, Mrha

John, I have the Mexico group. I am following up on this email to assess your interest in getting contracts in front of these indviduals.  Can you tell me if you will be following through on this or should I be directing this question to Louise?  Also, do you and Louise have a successor for Max in mind?  We will need to discuss PRC representation as well. My understanding is that Louise is planning to attend. Do we need anyone else to represent Mexico in the July 9th meeting?  Please advise or I will be happy to get on your calendar to discuss.

Seems to me a sensible move quickly on Steve Irvine and Jaime Williams to get contracts in place following Yzaguirre's departure. I believe Jaime's contract has just expired and Irvine we drafted back in April as part of the blitz approach but never got past the "do Yzaguirre first" obstacle.

What do you think? You want to talk with them or should we go direct to them?

David

John,

Attached is the outline for Mariner to manage the ECR assets.  It assumes
that the VPP assets are not included.  If the VPP assets are included, then
Joan Quick needs to be a part of the team.

Our P&L losses over the last few days have been due to four things primarily.

1)  We have been short crude, and are still short, in a $2.00 up move.  (today the market was down)
2)  We are liquidating many of our portfolios, and are paying large bid/offers.  We are also abandoning some of our P+ options with Koch since credit has indicated our inability to access cash will completely hamper our ability to exercise puts. 
3)  As a company we are short vol, and vol has been extremely strong, and continues to move against us.
4)  being long physical inventories in europe in a falling market.  In addition, none of our counterparts/customers/competitors are willing to take the product from us.

We will continue to work out of positions.

The gas desk made approx $33.5MM.  Preliminary numbers suggest VAR will be unchanged to higher, with the Central desk selling 41bcf (June) and the fin desk only buying a total of 28bcf throughout the term structure.  West desk reduced SoCal position by 500

?	Financial desk is forecasting a gain of $72MM and the west desk is forecasting a loss of $72MM

Not exactly.

I told Carol to go ahead and book the $1.25mm based on John's approval.  I also stated that it would be until June for us to sort out the inter business unit origination through the Risk and Accounting books.  I told her that Jean and John need to discuss how exactly this deal will be accounted for after August, assuming not all goes according to plan. 

Carol needs to book the $1.25mm and have Jeff Gossett get in contact with me to figure out the details.

Scott

John,

The timeline is as follows :

1.  Spoke with Nowlan this past Friday, he agreed to pay us this week.  As such, I had Carol Carter contact Scott Earnest, his book person, to receive monies.
2.  Carol called me yesterday and informed me that Scott would not be sending the money and that Nowlan would be calling me.
3.  I left a message with Nowlan yesterday asking him to contact me.
4.  We had our conversation regarding the P&L resulting from the Formosa deal.

I have cc'd all relevant parties.

Regards, Mrha

There are no accounting issues.  I am assuming that Nowlan is retrading the deal.  I will set up a meeting with Wes.

John -

Global Markets is maintaining that there are "accounting issues"  with the $1.25 million.  Should we get Faith Killen or Wes to get this wrapped up?

John,

>From all the information I am gathering, the Canadian gas curves should be out by 4:00 Houston time.  Kathy (Reeves) said the power curves should follow 30 minutes after the gas curves.  After talking with Phillip Love who is the Central Risk lead, it seems the traders are always away from their desks when it's time to load curves.  The usual response from the risk people is "we can't find the trader" when we are inquiring about the curve load.  

Any help you could give us would be GREATLY appreciated!

Thanks.

K.

The merger agreement with Dynegy provides that subs of Dynegy merger with Enron with Enron being the surviving corporation.  Enron and Dynegy then would be subs of a newly incorporated holding company.

It might be more advantageous for a variety of reasons to do a structure in which Enron mergers with the ultimate publicly traded company (whether existing Dynegy or a new holding company) with that publicly traded company being the nominal survivor.  Under Delaware, Oregon, and most other states' law, the surviving company automatically would assume all of Enron's obligations as a matter of law, and the merger agreement would so provide if this structure were used.

Could you review the various change-of-control provisions that you've previoulsy identified to see if this structure--with Enron not being the technical survivor of the merger--makes any difference to  your conclusions about whether those provisions would be triggered?  Please respond to Rob Walls, Lance Schuler, Joe Henry, Peter del Vecchio and me.  Thanks.

A loss notification memo will be circulated to Jeff Skilling.

Additionally, Rick said that he will leave Jeff a voice mail, but decided that calling the Board would not be appropriate this time.

We are concluding the valuation and booking of the Modesto Maranzana transaction. The final point that needs to be agreed upon to properly book the transaction is the year 5 terminal value of the plant. 

The model currently represents a terminal value of $7.5 million based upon subjective rational. We have analysed the market and economic situation thoroughly and believe it is appropriate to accurately represent the terminal value as $12 million. The rational and economic analysis is covered in the below e mail. 

I would like to discuss this with you sometime today. I will call to see if we can set up a short discussion. Let me know if you would like Vlady to participate.

Based upon getting your concurence and the final review of the model with Joe we should be ready to book the transaction early next week.

Subject:	Modesto Maranzana Terminal Value

We need to review the terminal value issue in the 5 year model. As we have discussed and John, I believe, agreed we do not believe salvage value is relevant in this short term time frame. I would also argue an arbitrary number such as $7.5 million is also not reflective of the true value in year five.

We have already received a verbal indication from Duke that they would have an interest in the facility at $9 - $11 million. Based upon Duke's minimal due diligence this is relevant in reconfirming our initial valuation and reflecting that there is demand for power generation assets in Argentina. 

In addition we believe the most accurate reflection of terminal value in year 5 is closer to our initial purchase price of $12 million. The below valuations, local market grid assessment, and our forward power curve support this conclusion.

1) Market Multiple of EBITDA Valuation:

There are two "public" companies that are currently trading on the local stock exchange, the Merval. Central Puerto and Central Costanera. Both are thermal power units in Argentina.

On average the EBITDA multiple for these companies is equal to four (3.8 + 4.2))2 = 4

Modesto Maranzana assumes an EBITDA of approximately $3 million.   MMPP EBITDA $ 3 MM x 4 = $ 12 MM

This is again supportive of our valuation of $12 million




2) Most Recent Market Transaction Valuation:

On Average the last 3 power acquisition transactions in the market were above $230 kW and the current market average is $213 kW. Based upon MMPP's installed capacity of 70 Mw and using the market average of $213 kW the plant could be valued as high as $14.9 million. This is again supports a conservative valuation of $12 million or $171 per kW. 








 

3) Rio Cuarto Grid Constraint Value Impact:
There currently exist constraints in the Rio Cuarto Node that will make MMPP very strategic in terms of the short term avoided cost of a network expansion. In turn there will be a premium value associated with maintaining the plant in the Rio Cuarto area. This premium would logically come in two forms:

	A.  The pending buyer of EPEC would enter into a commercial transaction with the plant to secure its position in the region. The format of the agreement would be a market based power contract with a premium demand charge or in the form of an obligatory agreement to maintain the plant in the area in recognition of a fixed annual fee.

	B. A related company of the company that buys EPEC in the pending privatisation would purchase the plant to secure its position in the region in recognition of the avoided cost associated with a grid expansion.

The avoided costs of the expansion projects are estimated to be between $4 and $16 million. 

  

4) Forward Power Price Value Impact
It is also relevant that Argentine power is contango and that in year 5 we will be in a more favourable scenario regarding forward power prices as noted below. This will support a stronger valuation at such time.



 

Loan Structure 
In addition I would like to solicit structuring the loan to be more reflective of cash flows in year 1. Under normal circumstances we try to structure a loan recognising the financial impact of the maintenance program. In light of this I request the loan be structured as interest only March 1, 2001 to December 31, 2001 and interest and principal there after.


Regards

Calgary  2 people Dawn Doucet lead.

Portland 2 people Julie Kearney is lead.

Houston:
Slone = Lavo and Gas
Fitzpatrick = Louise and retail risk management, plus some projects.
Melodick = power
Davies = recuiting
Buckley = trading track and AA's.
Oquinn/Broussard = compensation.
One assistant and one H.R. associate.

Plus me, Julie Clyatt and a share of corp charges for payroll, benefits, EEOC (compliance), HRIS, other AA stuff and Corp reporting.

I make this about 15 full time people and probably the equivalent of another 7-10 for these other functions, plus their expenses. If you want I can try to nail down some names for these people but I'm not sure that makes a whole lot of sense. They are more efficiently pooled.

The hold up in setting curves is we need a C$ forward curve.  If this curve was set sooner we could get ours out earlier.

John,

Here is an update of the Petrobras Marketing Agreement we briefed you on about 2 weeks ago.

We have executed a term sheet with Petrobras for the terms and conditions described in the updated presentation.  We also reran the economics based upon what is in the term sheet.

The term sheet defines the major commerical terms and conditions as well as gives us a 180 day exclusive with Petrobras on the volumes in question.

The term sheet is in Portuguese.

We can either discuss this at the "tail end" of today's Eletrobolt call or can schedule separately.  Whatever works for you.

Thanks,

Kish

Joe,

This version has a few minor changes, mainly format corrections. The main one is the inclusion of a slide describing the sharing mechanism for 2004-2011.

New Version 8 of the IntercontinentalExchangeTMIs Now Available !

 
ATTENTION ALL TRADERS. We are pleased to announce the release of Version 8 of the IntercontinentalExchangeTM. This latest version has many powerful new features including:
 
Quick Ticket Order Entry 
A Market Maker Window
Options Spreads
Custom Strip Options on WTI and Brent 1st Line Swaps
Weather Derivatives Products
New Portfolio Management Functions
New Multi-Transaction Printing
Trade Ticker Full Day Summary

Version 8 comprises Intercontinental's latest development initiative to bring better anonymous, two-way, OTC energy products trading to the electronic marketplace.
 
Installation of Version 8 is Easy 
 
Version 8 will be available for download and installation on your system this evening, Thursday, November 15th. Live trading with Version 8 will begin on November 16th. We have already notified your System Administrators of this new release and provided them with download and installation instructions. 
 
Version 8 is backward compatible with version 7.37 and version 7.72. This means you will still be able to run these older production versions of the IntercontinentalExchangeTM, if you choose to do so. However, since many of the new features, and products like option spreads, custom option strips and weather swaps are only available on version 8, we suggest that you contact your system administrator now, to ensure you will be getting all the benefits that version 8 has to offer as soon as possible.

John,

Wes called me and told me about your desire to remove the 25 MW Brazil trade from the "books" retroactively.  The reason given was tax implications.  I accepted the tax need at face value and want to do what is right for the company.

However, we (Remi and I) would like to talk to you about the P&L implications of doing this.  I assume we keep the P&L on the internal scorecard but need to work out the details on how this gets reflected.

Thanks,

Kish

Hi John,

Can you let me know if you wish to move forward with the non-compete agreements for the new trading track folks, in addition  we are due to send offers out to the external folks, do you wish me to hold on those (some of the documentationi s on your desk).

Thanks, Karen.

As mentioned during our phone call, the attached diagram illustrates the manner in which the ENE net operating loss was compartmentalized.  SHD.

Subject:	PROTEST AT ENRON CHICAGO...............

.........Frank and I are in Chicago on business.  

It's Monday morning and I'm sitting in the office waiting for Frank to get here when all of a sudden 50 people of the street come on to the trade floor with protest signs (a group called ACORN).  They are protesting the high natural gas prices and wanted us to fax a letter to Ken Lay condemning him for being a money hungry CEO.  
They were chanting and singing protest songs...............and had TV cameras with them.  All business had to be stopped for about half an hour.  It was funny cause they were saying things like...."look they all have palm pilots.......".   Well the COPS showed up and threatened to arrest them if they did not leave...............
It was really funny in a way but, also makes one think about the kind of misdirected information that people are fed by the media.....
So that's the protest story from Chicago.......

Thanks

Bharat

Remi

Things are changing.
This issue is still under discussion and the new proposed measures allow consumers to sell to generators, distributors and traders.
If this happens, their price is going to raise to MAE price (or close to). The main issue now is "Is MAE goig to start settling?".
I'll keep informing you guys.

Fred

Subject:	Re: mae measures   

That's one of the topics I wanted to address PRIORITARILY this afternoon.  According to Luis Otavio and Fred, customers A (alta tens?o, and demand greater than 2.5MW) will ONLY be allowed to sell "excess power" not consumed (capped at their "cota" or "meta" or quota) to OTHERS CONSUMERS, but not to MARKETERS.  The reason for this is that ANEEL/Parente don't want to "flood" MAE with positions to settle (the argument is, if MAE cannot manage 67 counterparties, they won't be able to manage several hundreds).  But it's crazy: all unbalanced (net) positions will be settled in spot market: if marketers are not allowed to act as intermediaries, there will be hundreds of net, bilateral positions to settle (and it WILL flood MAE), if marketers like Enron can be in the middle they will net themselves all positions on portfolio basis and they will show only ONE position in MAE.

This mechanism is no different from the often discussed concept of DEMAND SIDE MANAGEMENT.  The only way to make it work is to allow LIQUIDITY and therefore competition and therefore Marketers. 

It is vital that Marketers be authorized to acquire and sell this power, and settle their net position (net position only) in spot market.  EOL will be a great tool for this, and we may accelerate its launch in Brazil with this new, different product ("Restricted Power")

Subject:	mae measures

One of the proposals under review with the Apag?o team is to allow the B and A costumers to access the Mae and transact their "contracted energy" after their respective 20-25% reduction targets.  The MAE and the distributors do not have the systems in place to deal  with over 1,800,000 customers in the entire system. Elektro alone has close to 150000 customers in this class.    This can be a tremendous oportunity for Enron on Line to take off.  Remi could you review and prepare an action plan urgently.  These measures are targeted to be released next week.

During the month of June, RAC will begin the rollout of our new website and linked portfolio tracking system called PortRAC.  The website will provide the user with instantly available transaction policies, procedures, DASH's and other valuable reports and links.  The PortRAC system is an extensive database of merchant and strategic investment information combined with a powerful search engine and report writer.  PortRAC will enable the analysis of our investment portfolio in any fashion that the user specifies such as the calculation of returns for a particular industry or region.

I believe that the new RAC website and PortRAC system will be valuable tools to help manage our business and I would like to provide you a personal "demo" before we introduce these applications to a broader population.

In the next two weeks, Rick Carson will be contacting you to arrange a convenient time for the demo, which should take about 30 minutes.  I hope that you will be able to make time in your schedule.

Please call me with any questions.

Rick Buy

Please, take a  look at it. I met Claude a few years ago

Oscar Wyatt and Tom Bachtell have agreed with our recommendation to hold off doing anything pending the results of the MCN/MCNIC arbitration scheduled July 23 - August 10.

They also were unaware that our convertible preferred was non-voting which effectively ruled out doing anything at the June shareholder meeting along the lines they were considering since the record date has passed.

Subject:	Crown Energy

I spoke with Oscar Wyatt this afternoon on Crown and subsequently to Tom Bachtell, an attorney in Utah who is attempting to organize shareholders to replace existing management.  Crown has an asphalt oil sand production facility in northeast Utah and an asphalt distribution company.  Bachtell owns about 4-5% of the stock.  Mr. Wyatt indicated he had a "small" holding.  I indicated that we would consider any proposal that might result in salvaging some value from this investment.

We hold convertible preferred and a small amount of common at an original cost of $5.5 million in 1997.  Fully converted, our ownership would be approximately 25%.  The Company has a net deficit of $21 million and a "going concern" paragraph in its audit opinion.  We have written down our carrying value to nil.

The Company in engaged in an arbitration proceeding against MCN Energy and MCNIC Pipeline.  MCNIC has interests in the asphalt assets and is a lender to Crown.  MCNIC attempted to foreclose on certain Crown assets and Crown in turn counter-sued for $100 million.  The arbitration hearing will be held July 23 - August 10.  If Crown obtained an award from the arbitration, some value could be restored to our investment.

We will get further information from Bachtell on the details of his plans and recommend what position Enron should take in this matter.

weekend (days 8 and 9) before more cool air arrives.  11-15 indicates yet a=
nother trough digging into the East (temperatures normal to below normal) w=
ith the primary ridge remaining in the Southwest (above to much above).

2) 1-5 Day forecast also looks similar still quite cool for the East and Mi=
dwest - though not quite as hot for the immediate West Coast.  Above to muc=

 mid-week.  No prolonged period of heat will affect the Northwest. =20

As we expected, people are finding that the placement of people is not meeting all their needs.  I plan to meet with Presto, Duran and Arnold's folks next Tuesday, Nov 27 to review potential changes.  I will prepare a strawman and let you guys have a look and give your approval at that time.

Any approved changes to the current configuration will be scheduled for Friday Nov. 30.

Regards,
Tammy

John,

Yesterday, Randy Buckman and I tested out NetScape on four different
Enron computers and found that wireless access to EnronOnline was not
possible with the various NetScape 4.7x versions Enron uses.  This 
occurs even in the Enron Building.

Even the 4.77 release just 2 months ago has this issue with the Cisco
802.11 wireless standard.  I've had great assistance from the Network
Security team on EB34 throughout this so far, and know that we will 
be able to come up with an answer.

The Nortel hardware VPN solution is temporarily disconnected at your
home for a related issue, and I have put the Nortel software VPN on
your upstairs laptop.  However, Nortel directly states that it won't
run on dualprocessor workstations like yours -- I'll have a fix soon.

My Director became aware of the issue yesterday while Randy and I did
some testing in the building.  Others will be working on the solution.

John, we have factored the additional $6M in costs into the Q2 budget to  ensure complete coverage of the EES risk group costs.   As per our earlier discussion, I would like to schedule the risk group into the EES PRC. It might be helpful to have you participate to get a better handle on some of the people and iniatives going on in EES.  I am also working the risk group bonus costs into the EES plan.  We are planning on killing the sales incentive plan next week.  Is there a better name for your group than the EES risk group? Spoke to Haedicke about his concerns asked him to give me proposal that advances the business independent of people and ENA/EES regular politics. He said he would have that together Friday.  Lets discuss.

Working on the note for review and comment .....  

Regards
Delainey

Subject:	Re: May position : sold !!!!!

We tried all day to sell this volume below.  Market is extremely illiquid, given Annex V uncertainty and other regulatory issues: generators believe Parente will help them out in May, while LDCs look at their contracts and reduced demand.  However AES Sul accepted to buy this volume at 25% discount to May spot price, payment on June 25th.  We will net about R$600,000 (US$250,000) between sale and purchase prices.  Credit is OK.

We will keep a very small, long position at MAE settlement for May.

This is to inform that we have closed 2.200 MWh for May to AES Sul at 25% discount rate against spot price at southeast sub-market to be paid on Jun 25th.

I checked with the desk heads and as of noon they haven't gotten any shorter.  The central desk said that they have purchased approx. 1000

I want to take a moment to thank each of you for having a summer Analyst or Associate work on your team. I also want to remind everyone what a high stakes activity this is for Enron.
Based on your recommendation, we will make offers at the end of the summer to those interns who perform, and who you endorse as a potential future member of your team. Those interns who have had a good experience and accept our offer will be the lowest risk hires we make - from any source. We will have effectively interviewed and watched them work for 2-3 months. They also have the potential to be the most effective advocates and talent scouts we have, when they return to campus. On the flip side, those who don't have meaningful assignments, or have bad experiences during the summer can severely hurt our efforts.
Thank you again for being part of this very important activity. If you have any questions, or if areas of concern arise during the summer, please contact Ted Bland (x35275), Traci Warner (x33242) or me (x36671).
We appreciate your contributions to this important effort for Enron. 
Billy

John,
You agreed to the original request below, I received a request from Jill Zively today for 4 more desks for the mid-market group below.  This will completely consume the 36 desks Don was allocated.  

Please advise.  They want to move on Nov. 30.

Thanks,
Tammy

Tammy, we need to be sure that the 4 sales folks sitting at the EES Gas Desk are also moved along with the rest of the desk to the new building. These guys are responsible for rollover deals/retail "mid-market"-type transactions, etc. and need to be sitting with our gas desk. If there is any issue with this, call me.

Attached is a slightly revised risk memo from the one I showed you yesterday.  As we discussed, I have reduced the risk rating to a 2.  The only other change is that I clarified that we will still need IDB approval for a sale of our remaining 20%.  Although this is not a new risk created by this transaction, the earlier language about transfer restrictions could have left the reader with the impression that we no longer needed IDB approval once we went down to 20%.

Please call if you have any questions.

Dear John,

Thanks for taking the time to meet with me on Wednesday afternoon.  Your synthesis of Enron's structured, mid-market and trading deals vis-a-vis broad geographic classifications of electricity markets in North America was particularly enlightening.  I also appreciate your referring Dave Duran and Chris Calger of East and West Power Origination, respectively.  Although I was unable to meet with Dave due to time constraints, I expect to speak with him in the course of my discussions with Ben Jacoby--who works with Dave.

Best regards,
Manuel

Yes,   we have 5 externals coming in next  Wednesday.
 
        From the 32 resumes shortlisted by you

14 of which were interviewed by your direct reports (remainder were not interested in Houston/job)
8 of which were recommeded by your traders
6 of which accepted an 2nd round interview (five of which are confirmed for next Wednesday, 1 could not make that date)

We therefore have a confirmd number of 15 to interview next Wednesday, however I was given additional internal names last night to follow up on this am.   I will confirm exact number of interviews later this morning but could be anywhere in the region from 15-20.
 
I have asked the current group in the Trading Track to faciliate an office tour of the trading floors/gas control room.   Following which there will be an informal lunch for all of the candidates in one of the conference rooms to include the current Trading Track folks.   Interviews will follow at 2.00 pm at the Allen Center.  Schedules are being formalised today and will be forwarded to you.
 
Thanks,
 
karen.

John 

Following the interviews next week, suggest your management team get together to review the rotations for the Trading Track, to see if they continue to meet business/Employe needs to ensure we have accurate data from a tracking perspective.     

Karen

<<trading track rotations.xls>> 

Attached is the current list of rotations for the Trading Track participants and future assigned rotations (as decided at the time of hiring).    Can you please re-confirm you have these people in your group currently, as I appear to have conflicting information.  I will re-send, if any changes occur.

If there is any movement of these people between groups can you plese keep me in the loop. 

Kind regards, 

Karen.

  [IMAGE] [IMAGE] [IMAGE]      Dear john lavorato :  As a valued customer o=
f chapters.ca, we feel it's important to let you know about a significant c=
hange we will be implementing next week. As we prepare to merge Indigo and =
Chapters, we are combining the operations of both sites into chapters.indig=
o.ca. This new site will blend the best of chapters.ca and indigo.ca to cre=
ate the most efficient, engaging and entertaining online retail site for bo=
oks, music, movies, gifts, garden products and more.  To get to the site yo=
u need do nothing different - you can simply enter www.chapters.ca  as you =
have previously done, and you'll arrive there.  Specific to your Chapter 1?=
 Club membership, you will continue to benefit from the same savings and re=
ward structure that is currently in place. Your account information will re=
main active on chapters.indigo.ca. We are also hard at work on a program th=
at will see that all of our customers share in the rewards of both loyalty =
programs. Of course, we will happily announce these improvements as soon as=
 they are finalized.  Come along as we turn the page on a new chapter of on=
line retailing. We want to make this transition as safe and seamless as pos=
sible for our customers. To that end, we want to assure you of the followin=
g:  Orders already placed at chapters.ca will be filled and shipped by Chap=
ters.   For your convenience, your credit card information, shipping and bi=
lling addresses and Chapter 1? Club number will remain active on chapters.i=
ndigo.ca -- there will be no need to re-submit this information.   This is =
an exciting time! The future is bright and we thank you for your continued =
support.  Stay tuned for a follow-up email in the next week that will forma=
lly announce the launch. Please feel free to contact us if you have any con=
cerns.    Sincerely,  Peter Cooper PeterCooper@Chapters.ca    *************=

I spoke with Arnold regarding limit violation and he understood issue.  I spoke with Presto and his response was that his desk is within his limits and he didn't see need to reduce risk.  I await direction.

After several very difficult weeks, Enron announced on Friday that the company has reached an agreement to merge with Dynegy.  

I know that everyone has many questions right now regarding the future of the Associate / Analyst Program.  We are working as quickly as possible with the business units and executive management to determine the future course of the Program.  As the merger points on the Enron homepage indicate (<http://home.enron.com/>), Dynegy has a similar program called "PACE", and the two companies will consider a combination of the two programs.  

Today, all of the business units within Enron will be holding floor meetings to discuss the pending merger and it's implications for Enron.  I encourage each of you to participate in one of these meetings.  

The announcement of the deal with Dynegy marks a significant event in removing some of the uncertainties we've all dealt with over the past several weeks.  As decisions are made regarding the future of the company and specific business units, we will be able to determine and communicate the future of the Program.

New opportunities will be created from the changes that are occurring.  The very best talent from both organizations will rise to the top, and our Associates and Analysts will be a key part of our future success.

I appreciate your continued efforts and patience during this difficult time.

Billy Lemmons
Vice President,  Associate / Analyst Program
