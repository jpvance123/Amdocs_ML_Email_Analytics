Jason, 
Attached is the list of points with location information.  
Also, in response to your other questions, Florida River is BP's gas processing plant in La Plata County, CO.  Elmore is a power generation plant (Idaho Power) and Southend balancing is a logical point for NWP use.  
Let me know if you need additional information. 
Thanks, 
Wes Kida

Jason, 
What kind of attitude is that, you should always be will to party with friends.  We will set another day just in case but getting a lot of folks together at one time is a challenge.
How are things at Enron?  You going to be okay?

   The original plan was to try and meet this week but the response has 
   been light.  From the few that did respond (which I thank for the 
   feedback) the consensus was to try and meet on Thursday but no location 
   was picked.  I will unfortunately be out of town this Thursday and 
   Friday on business.  If you guys still want to get together use the 
   Reply to All and set up a time and place.  It has been a long time since 
   most of us have tossed back a few brewskies together so don't let my 
   absents stop you (as if it really would).  I think my ego can take it, 
   may be not my id but my ego can.

   P.S.  I had asked Rex to send out a notice but I did not receive a copy 
   so I don't know if he had done so.  If you did Rex thanks, if you 
   didn't....we need to talk about your memory loss.

As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

I'm confused. The gas daily prices is ok.
Question on index curves. What index curves do you need?

	a. the curves from egs_curves that are inserted into the
	   database everyday because the prices are different everyday.
	   risk type code = 'I' and curve_type_cd = 'PR'.

	b. the curves from the pub posting that are inserted into
	    the database once a month. These are the settle price curves.
	    risk type code = 'D' and curve_type_cd = 'SP'

That's fine. The Index curves we are most concerned with (the current month), will be set in the next day
or so and will not change for the duration of the month. Next month's index curves can be loaded whenever.

Jason,

	The Gas Daily Curves are loaded into the system everyday at 6AM
	or something when they have problems, the curves are loaded at
	around 11AM. I can get these curves as soon as they get it.
	However, Index curves are loaded by GGREENA, CFRANK2, and CRABON
	at around 3PM or 4PM. I will not be able to get these curves.
	I can get Yesterdays Index curves.

This Pump and go deep clown is so lucky we didn't blow him out.  We need more linebackers less DEs.  He got lucky / we need a better defense.  Great call on the Staley tip.

Dude, what I meant was that I count Chad Brown as a DE and you should too.  But oh well, if you say that we had a bad defensive game, so be it.  But we'll see in two weeks.  Hopefully the Bus keeps on rolling, and Peyton starts to dominate again...

Jason,

	The Gas Daily Curves are loaded into the system everyday at 6AM
	or something when they have problems, the curves are loaded at
	around 11AM. I can get these curves as soon as they get it.
	However, Index curves are loaded by GGREENA, CFRANK2, and CRABON
	at around 3PM or 4PM. I will not be able to get these curves.
	I can get Yesterdays Index curves.

We will meet for thirty minutes before our 3:30 fundies meeting.  

1.  EOL market making - Lavo has asked us to increase basis liquidity.  Janie has mentioned general theme of market, "why trade on EOL 5000/d and risk moving the market".  We are becoming market framers.  I think Frank Ermis is a pioneer.

2.  Deal confirmations - Anne Bike misbooked a deal for me from March, cost $3.5 million.  How do we deal with this issue of confirmations missing deals.

3.  Vacation and work hours - Discuss vacation schedules for the rest of the year.  We need to do a good job of coordinating when we are out.

Mike

Hey. Did you know that Woody Williams was a shortstop for the Cougars back
in the 80's? How cool is that? Not only is he a bad ass that beats the Big
Unit in the playoffs, but he's one of us.

Subject:=09Competitive Analysis Update #26- US Response to Terrorism
Importance:=09High


See below for update on situation in Afghanistan as well as fiscal stimulus=
 plans in Congress.

RJ

1. =09The War on the Ground

For the most part, the military action in Afghanistan is likely to be the s=
pecial forces "inserted" into Afghanistan to locate bin Laden. The special =
forces are doing very little in the way of fighting and will instead use th=
e collected intelligence from various sources to "snatch" bin Laden and oth=
ers, or to find other targets, identify them, and then call in attack aircr=
aft.  Such attacks are by now well-priced in and would appear to be unlikel=
y to have a disruptive impact on financial or energy markets.

Over the weekend, the press picked up on our reports from last week that cu=
rrently the US has Delta Force, Green Beret, and Army Ranger units on the g=
round and some special operation forces "in-country."  Also,  British Speci=
al Air Service units, the French Regiment de Parachutistes d'Infanterie de =
Marine, and the German elite KSK special forces will be playing a role. Adv=
ance groups of the US 101st and 82nd airborne divisions arrived nearly a we=
ek ago at the Pakistani military base of Dar Esmail Khan, which is just wes=
t of the Suleyman mountains near Khojastan, a pass into Afghanistan and to =
Kandahar. Allied ground troops, backed by helicopter gunships and armored A=
C-130 armored planes have been stationed at former Soviet military airbases=
 near Tashkent in Uzbekistan.=20

The ground forces are backed by a massive concentration of allied airpower,=
 ranging from nearly 150 US Air Force B-1 and B-52 bombers and F-16s and F-=
14s, as well as the nearly 400 aircraft in the four battle carrier groups t=
he US Navy has moved into nearby waters led by the USS Enterprise, the USS =
Theodore Roosevelt, the USS Carl Vinson, and the USS Kitty Hawk. In additio=
n the British have some 20,000 troops in Oman and a Royal Navy squadron aro=
und the HMS Invincible.

Allied air power and close ground support gunships are expected to provide =
air support to any coordinated attacks by the loosely aligned Northern Alli=
ance, the main Afghan opposition to the Taliban. =20

Due to the recognition of the difficult internal political situation in Pak=
istan, the US and allied presence is being kept to a very low profile and t=
he actual contribution of Pakistani military forces is being kept to a mini=
mum.  Yet it is the Pakistanis who will play a decisive role using their in=
telligence network in Afghanistan to find bin Laden.

2.=09Fiscal Stimulus Outlook
By the end of October Congress will have passed a new package of stimulus m=
easures totaling somewhere between $100 and $180 billion, if you count the =
$55 billion in airplane and reconstruction/defense spending already passed.=
=20
Most officials with a dog in this hunt agree that tax-cutting gets preferen=
ce over spending, but that there will have to be some direct spending to an=
esthetize the center-left crowd in the Senate and in the House where nerves=
 are beginning to go raw over corporate "bailouts" that have not yet includ=
ed anything directly for the employees. So for now, here is a brief list of=
 the major policy options with equally brief commentary about their prospec=
ts:
?=09Payroll tax cut/suspension -- This has emerged as the most likely item =
to be on any final list agreed to. As a stimulus item the economics are pro=
bably better on this than almost anything else, since it puts money directl=
y in the pockets of workers who earn too little to pay income taxes and it =
can be implemented very quickly. Although it could add up to a very big num=
ber if suspended ($700 bn per year), because this is the money that goes in=
to Social Security political leaders of both parties know they have to be c=
areful about how the accounting and packaging get done on this. Still, both=
 the White House and congressional Dems are big on this. Some version is li=
kely to pass and the totals are likely to be somewhere around $30 bn.=20
?=09Accelerate the Bush tax cut -- If the original Bush tax cut was the rig=
ht medicine, then why not have some more? The thinking here is that you hav=
e already agreed to do these things, and you no longer are watching the bud=
get flip from black to red, why not put more money in the hands of those wh=
o pay the most taxes? The White House has been putting this idea forward, b=
ut not too aggressively, and the Democrats on the Hill have made it clear t=
hat they want the next tranche of tax relief to go to someone other than "t=
he rich." Chances low, but if there is a broad package, this could get in.=
=20
?=09Capital gains tax cut -- This came on fast and has essentially died. It=
 is too offensive and too obviously lacking in any stimulative qualities fo=
r anyone outside of senior House Republicans to like. Take this one off you=
r list.=20
?=09Unemployment insurance and health care extension plus worker retraining=
 programs -- These are very big among Democrats and the White House is symp=
athetic, but House Republican leaders are deeply split on this topic. There=
 are some obviously restorative qualities to spending money this way, but t=
he totals being batted around (over $30 billion for the retraining and heal=
th care components alone) send the Texas components of House leaders into s=
hock, complaining of socialism. Democrats argue that Speaker Hastert promis=
ed them support for some serious version of these programs in return for ba=
iling out the airlines without clogging the debate with "airline worker ass=
istance" packages (worth about $4 billion). Hastert is saying he will still=
 try to deliver, but his second and third in command are leading an in-hous=
e rebellion.=20
?=09Cut in corporate taxes -- A permanent cut in corporate taxes would be v=
irtually impossible to wrangle through, but a temporary corporate tax cut i=
s something that both Treasury Department and White House officials want to=
 achieve. This is obviously something Democrats will not be happy about, bu=
t if they get the payroll tax relief and substantial amounts of their worke=
r assistance package, they have to swallow hard for something. This was an =
early favorite of the administration's. As with most of the proposals that =
seemed so promising when they were first announced, this one has been runni=
ng into some tough reality. There are a few problems with lower marginal co=
rporate tax rates that have emerged. For one, many large corporations pay o=
n something the IRS likes to call the AMT schedule (that's the Alternative =
Minimum Tax), so they would get no break at all. Even more disturbing is th=
at companies with large tax-loss carryforwards sitting on the books as asse=
ts would take a massive hit on the value of these assets, since the calcula=
ted benefit they bring is adjusted downward all at once. For some weakened =
companies this alone could be fatal, since their attractiveness to acquirer=
s depends on their loss-carry forwards. Finally, many employee expenses tha=
t companies can still get are deducted at their full marginal tax rate and =
the value of those deductions would obviously drop.=20
?=09Investment Tax Credit And Accelerated Depreciation Schedules -- The vas=
t assortment of cuts that could come under this rubric are all plagued by t=
he same problem: just talking about them gives businesses another reason to=
 delay making investments. Even if the administration were to announce that=
 all of these breaks will be given retroactively once legislation is passed=
, investments would be delayed since the fine print on what qualifies and o=
n which schedule would mean huge differences in tax exposure. There is no w=
ay to propose these without delaying investment. On the plus side, the acce=
lerated depreciation is simpler to describe in legislation, and can be done=
 for a limited period without the same degree of distortion as the full ITC=
. Also, given the speed at which the stimulus debate is going forward, ther=
e may be less concern about the investment postponement issue. This item is=
 likely in some form to make it into a final package, but the details don't=
 exist yet, and its in the details that the significance of it lies.=20
?=09Specific sectoral tax breaks -- From the steel industry to the restaura=
nt and hotel industry, every trade association has a specific tax break in =
mind that would help them recover. This is going to be the hardest to handi=
cap since many of the small deals will be shoved in at the last minute on p=
ersonal orders from members and they will not be big enough individually to=
 make a macro difference. Cumulatively, though, these could easily top $10 =
billion before the special pleading is done.  Programs like high-speed rail=
, additional defense money, additional unemployment insurance for hard hit =
sectors could be shoved into this catch-all rubric. Some of these will make=
 the cut others will not, but they can add up fast.=20
?=09Fast Track Trade Authority -- USTR Bob Zoellick told congressional lead=
ers that if we had any chance to win the war against terrorism, the Preside=
nt would have to have full and complete fast track authority to cut trade d=
eals as necessary. But Zoellick found himself apologizing to enraged Democr=
ats for implying that a vote against fast track was a vote for terrorism. I=
f he can recover from the politics of that maneuver, this one actually has =
some logic behind it as a diplomatic and economic response -- and it doesn'=
t cost anything.

We will be following this for you with increasingly close focus this week s=
ince the real decisions will start to get made later this week and early in=
 the next. Again, with an end-October deadline, there isn't a lot of time t=
o waste and members of Congress are well aware of that fact.

Alright, which one of you sent the "Just a Tip" thing? I haven't opened it
yet. Is it ok to open at work? I'm serious. This is a small place, and I
just started, and they're pretty straight laced around here. If I open
something bad and get fired I wouldn't be too happy.

I am not.  And I am not buying a tee shirt. White or baseball. And I am not
shaving anything into my mullet. Or getting a license plate. Travis,
neither are you.
Have fun though... Keep an eye out for Beth's towers.

In an effort to protect Enron's e-mail system from harmful viruses, the Global Messaging Team has implemented an inbound and outbound cluster of MAILSweeper servers. What does that mean to you, the user? All inbound and outbound Internet mail is passed through a set of servers that will scan each message for viruses, malicious code, business related-content and inappropriate content. Inbound Internet mail that contains the following attachment types will be quarantined (held for delivery): *.vbs, *.exe, *.com, *.bat, *.cmd. If you are the intended recipient of one of these e-mails, you will receive an automatic notification with instructions on how to get your legitimate e-mail released from quarantine.

We have taken these measures to protect our e-mail environment from harmful e-mail viruses. We believe that these protections will result in less down time for your e-mail, in the event that Enron gets hit with a virus or malicious code.

Dear Customers, 
This is not a joke nor a prank. We urge you that you contact the FBI or 
any authorities that you can. I am one of Mr. Young's former employess 
and he has fled the state or even the country. We believe that he has 
fled to Brazil in which is his wifes home. We have passed by his 
residency and found that all of his belongings are gone. We have tried 
to contact him and there is no answer. He has left all his employees 
with checks that have NO FUNDS. He has ripped off not only his customers 
now but his employees as well. When we passed by his wife's workplace we 
were told that she has not appeared since Monday. Please take any 
actions that you can, we also are in the process of seeking legal 
advice. I urge that you forward this message to everyone that you know 
that has bought from laptopnet.com, gigabid.com, NetPC.com, 
genialbid.com, or bidncarry. This is not a joke, you may contact me at 
ivettemejia78@hotmail.com <mailto:ivettemejia78@hotmail.com >  should you 
have any questions. All of the employees are trying to email as many 
customers as possible so that they know what's going on.We may not be 
able to be in contact for long through this email for he had been 
changing the passwords once he notices that we are warning the 
customers!

I don't mean to intrude, but I saw where you placed an ebay bid for 1981 Fleer.  I wish you the best of luck on the auction, but if you get outbid or want additional copies, www.baseball.dtshops.com has 1981 Fleer for sale at a cost $1.00.

The website has inventories, s/h info, and ordering details.  You can find it at:

www.baseball.dtshops.com

As I said, I don't mean to intrude.  So if you find this info annoying you can make sure you don't receive any by Clicking this link: http://www.dtutils.net/cgi-bin/EM/Unsubscribe.pl?User=jason.wolfe@enron.com.

All Logistics:

Since there have been several changes since the last non-scripted  test, I =
encourage all of you to get into the system and try it out during the 11 to=
 3 time frame.  This is particularly important if you use some special func=
tionality such as one of the pipeline cross-reference tables (TxEast, TENN,=
 etc.), select point or currency/volume conversions (TCPL, Nova etc.).  Thi=
s may be your last chance to uncover any problems prior to this Saturday's =
proposed go-live date.  Report any problems to those listed below.

      All, 
      This email is directed to my peeps at Enform who may be interested in 
   a 
      night at the Alley, 
      to see the "international comedy sensation" -  "Art!!!" 
      (exclamation points added by me for necessary emphasis) 
      Corporate design tyrants like Beth, who just need to relax - it's the 
      perfect thing! 
      Tyrants-up-and-coming and current princess-wanna-be's: Ashley, it's 
      meets your 
      faux-high-society sensibilities to a T! 
      Posing celebrity-satellites: Matt - it beats hanging out at the 
      Starbucks, but requires pants! 
      Invite your friends and foes alike! 
      Oct 12 tickets are still available, section A, for about $45 a piece. 
      Get back at me, playas, 
      they're going fast. 
      Drinks and the theatre, how do you beat that? 
      Whoooooo! 
      Jason

Subject: Enron Announces Plans to Merge with Dynegy

Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.

I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.

And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.

Hey, thanks for trying to squeeze in a few minutes with your friends the

      So, are people in your area getting nervous? Is everybody looking for
      jobs
      at other companies? There are only 3 companies left to interview with
      through Duke for Tara. Under normal circumstances she could just
   contact
      a
      bunch of other energy companies in Houston and probably get as good
   an
      offer
      from one of them, but with thousands of Enron employees flooding the
      market,
      who knows. Tara found out from a friend of hers at UT that a company
      called
      Peabody in St. Louis is willing to hire anybody with experience at
      Enron.
      Sweet Jesus, I could get season tickets!

      If there is an Enron next week, she will probably get an offer.
   Unless
      we
      are owned by Dynegy.
      Then I don't know. Either way, don't quit cleaning boats yet.

         Do you still have a job? Tara is hearing some pretty nasty stuff

         Enron. She's pretty worried that they are gonna renig on their

Please answer all of the questions below... 
Are we going to look for a ring tomorrow?  
Do you know what size she wears? (I'm working on finding out myself) 
What time frame do you want to work with for an engagement? (Yes a TIME FRAME)  (ie, in a week, month, year...) 
I have the impression that beth wants you to take care of the whole wedding thing, is this true? 
She says she wants to go away (deffinately tropical because she has never seen blue water) and invite close family members (parents sibblings) and close friends by sending a letter/invitation.  She says they will need time to save if they are going to come, so I suggested 6 months.
Does this sound appealing to you? 
FYI... My brother went away to get married and I have a friend who went away so I have experience in planning tropical weddings.  They are great because only those who you want there come and others aren't affended for not being invited because y'all went away.  You can have a dream wedding for just a little more than what a nice vacation would cost.  It is alot cheaper than having one here which is probably important if y'all are paying for it.
What is my budget for the ring? 
What is my budget for the wedding? 
Please answer all of the questions above to the best of your ability.  This is crucial to the success of your engagement.  Thanks for your help!

Hi Jason, 
Tried to call you, but could't get through at 503.464.8637.  Is that the right number?  Here's some suggestions on how to access the data you want:
POINTS LIST:  My point list is pretty out of date.  If you have access to NW Passage, you can get to a current list by logging in, go to "EBB", then "Point Capacity", then hit refresh.  If you want to look at the capacity of a specific point, highlight the point and hit "Point Capacity".
SCHEDULED POINT VOLUMES:  You can look at scheduled volumes at all points, including the "zones" that we were talking about, via the scheduling screen.  You must be logged into NW Passage.  Go to the "Noms" Section, then the "Scheduling" window.  Click on the "Meter" radio button at the upper left and fill in the desired date or date range.  Hit "Refresh" and the point volumes should pop up and look similar to the view scheduling screen.  You have the option to save this information into a spreadsheet as well as look at volumes for a range of dates.  This should give you the same data as the unutilized capacity report with the addition of the other "zone" and throughput volumes.  It looks like a pretty comprehensive list of active points as well.  The scheduling screen is pretty powerful and has a lot of other features as well... you might play around with it or call me to find out what else it can do.
Please call me if you have any questions. 
Thanks, 
Wes Kida

Subject: gas load at Aluminum Ingot plants


Ms. Ridinger:

I am an analyst studying industrial gas load in the northwestern United
States
and am attempting to place a number of aluminum plants. I believe I have
the
Northwest Pipeline DRN numbers for 3 of your 4 plants, but am not sure
which meter feeds your Ferndale, WA plant. Also, I would like to confirm
the DRNs
for the other three.
If you, or someone you could refer me to, could provide this information
I would
greatly appreciate it.

Thanks,

Enron
Enron  is one of the world's leading electricity, natural gas and communications  companies. The company, which owns approximately $37 billion in energy and  communications assets, produces electricity and natural gas, delivers physical  commodities and financial and risk management services to customers around the  world, and has developed an intelligent network platform to facilitate online  business - EnronOnline. Enron's Internet address is www.enron.com . The stock is traded under the  ticker symbol "ENE".
 
 
Is this correct? I thought Enron didn't produce  electricity...or natural gas....just transported it....

I cannot help you with this but forwarded your message to our power
department.  I believe the contact person is Keith Clauson in Pittsburgh at
phone # 412-553-2700.  I was under the impression that you would hear from
him.

All, 
This email is directed to my peeps at Enform who may be interested in a 
night at the Alley, 
to see the "international comedy sensation" -  "Art!!!" 
(exclamation points added by me for necessary emphasis) 
Corporate design tyrants like Beth, who just need to relax - it's the 
perfect thing! 
Tyrants-up-and-coming and current princess-wanna-be's: Ashley, it's 
meets your 
faux-high-society sensibilities to a T! 
Posing celebrity-satellites: Matt - it beats hanging out at the 
Starbucks, but requires pants! 
Invite your friends and foes alike! 
Oct 12 tickets are still available, section A, for about $45 a piece. 
Get back at me, playas, 
they're going fast. 
Drinks and the theatre, how do you beat that? 
Whoooooo!

We will hold off transferring any physical positions desk to desk until the end of bidweek.  After NX1, we will transfer positions at a daily EOL Index mid price.  Please monitor my book and others to make certain DEC deals are not being transferred prior to NX1 at an IF monthly or GD daily mid price.

Hey Jason,
 What have you been up to? We haven't heard from you in quite awhile.
 I took some pictures of Mikayl on his birthday, so I'll have Dad scan them
for me.
 One of the babysitter's kids has strep throat so we hope Mikayl doesn't get
it. He has a cold now. Jill stopped by here on her way to the sitter's so I
saw Mikayl for a minute. He was his cheerful self depite the cold.
 Wesclin started their football program this year, they're having a parade
and bonfire for homecoming for the first time. We may go to town to watch
the parade.
 Better go and feed your fat feline sister and the tiny one.
Love, Mom

All,

This email is directed to my peeps at Enform who may be interested in a night at the Alley,
to see the "international comedy sensation" -  "Art!!!" 
(exclamation points added by me for necessary emphasis)

Corporate design tyrants like Beth, who just need to relax - it's the perfect thing!

Tyrants-up-and-coming and current princess-wanna-be's: Ashley, it's meets your
faux-high-society sensibilities to a T!

Posing celebrity-satellites: Matt - it beats hanging out at the Starbucks, but requires pants!

Invite your friends and foes alike!

Oct 12 tickets are still available, section A, for about $45 a piece. Get back at me, playas,
they're going fast.

Drinks and the theatre, how do you beat that?

Whoooooo!

Jason

After much success last year with our AskWhy advertising campaign and Public Relations efforts, Enron continues to explore new ways to exponentially increase its' brand awareness not only through television, but also by exploring new mediums. One approach is through customer relationship marketing (CRM), where we will seek opportunities that allow our commercial teams to directly interact with important CXOs and existing customers. 

To this end, we are proud to announce our participation in the Frank Gehry Architect Exhibition at the Guggenheim Museum in New York City, which will be open to the public from May 18 through August 31.  Frank Gehry is a world-renowned architect who has designed the unique building at the end of our "Ode to Why" commercial and his art dominates skylines around the world. With this exhibition, Gehry's evolving genius comes to life.  For years, his inspiration has long been hidden in sketches and models unseen by anyone but his closest collaborators. By challenging the conventional, he has redefined his industry just as Enron has in business. Through Enron's association with this world-class exhibit, we will subtly push our brand attributes forward, as we strive to be the "Leading Company in the World."

All employees are invited to visit this exhibition FREE OF CHARGE with an Enron ID Badge beginning May 18. For more details, please visit home.enron.com.

The original plan was to try and meet this week but the response has been light.  From the few that did respond (which I thank for the feedback) the consensus was to try and meet on Thursday but no location was picked.  I will unfortunately be out of town this Thursday and Friday on business.  If you guys still want to get together use the Reply to All and set up a time and place.  It has been a long time since most of us have tossed back a few brewskies together so don't let my absents stop you (as if it really would).  I think my ego can take it, may be not my id but my ego can.
Bruce 
P.S.  I had asked Rex to send out a notice but I did not receive a copy so I don't know if he had done so.  If you did Rex thanks, if you didn't....we need to talk about your memory loss.

Dear Jason Wolfe, 
It has been a while since we spoke about your driving needs. Our inventory has changed since then and I realize your needs may have changed as well.
We can still have the vehicle you originally were interested in within 24 hours and we also have some that are similar with similar equipment, only less expensive. Toyota has special financing rates available on Corollas, Tundras, 4Runners and 2001 Siennas. We have great deals on 2002 Camrys.
If youd like to revisit our inventory, please click here www.smccalltoyota.com 
I look forward to hearing from you soon.
Sincerely, 
Joyce Mbiu

   Word of the Day for Thursday November 8, 2001:

   hebetude \HEB-uh-tood-; -tyood\, noun:
   Mental dullness or sluggishness.

     While  too  many Americans slouch toward a terminal funk of
     hebetude and sloth, Bendians race ahead with toned muscles,
     wide eyes and brains perpetually wired on adrenaline.
     --"Wild  rides  in the heart of central Oregon: Bent out of
     shape in Bend," [1]Washington Times, August 11, 2001

     Earlier  on,  when we merely democratized fame, we defended
     the  right  of  any  mouth-breather  to  rise from deserved
     obscurity on the strength of his God-given hebetude.
     --Florence  King,  "The  misanthrope's corner," [2]National
     Review, May 18, 1998

     From that solitude, full of despair and terror, he was torn
     out  brutally,  with  kicks  and  blows,  passive,  sunk in
     hebetude.
     --Joseph Conrad, [3]Nostromo
     _________________________________________________________

   Hebetude  derives  ultimately  from Latin hebes, "blunt, dull,
   mentally  dull,  sluggish,  stupid."  The  adjective  form  is
   hebetudinous \heb-uh-TOOD-n-us; -TYOOD-\.

Hi Marilyn, 
I am helping a friend plan an "away" wedding.  I was wondering if you knew of or would suggest any resorts that have full wedding services that we can start looking at.  They want simple wedding and are going to invite their close family and friends, but are not sure who will be able to come yet.  I am thinking it will probably be about 10 people.  They definitely want something tropical and probably all-inclusive would be best.  I had a friend who got married in Playa de Carmen, but I'm not sure which resort.  I was thinking somewhere in Mexico would be good but definitely not Cancun.  They are on a tight budget because they will be paying for it themselves.  So here are the details about what we are looking for:
Tropical All-Inclusive Resort
Round trip airfare
Travel date between November 2001 and January 2002 (what time is cheaper?)
Wedding Services including someone to perform the ceremony, flowers for the bride, photography, location for ceremony (possibly on the beach), location for reception for about 10 people (can be restaurant at the resort)

I couldn't discuss this on the phone because it is my coworkers boyfriend and I who are planning it and she sits right next to me.  If you could give me a list of resorts we will look over them, narrow it down, and then get back to you.  Thank you so much for your help!

B Team, 
The holidays are here but there is still time to toss back a few with friends.  So before your holiday schedule is full put down Thursday November 29th for the B Team....
Where you might ask, well let's try something different but not to different...Fox & Hound on Westheimer, west of the Belt Way about a mile.  If that is okay with you folks then we will plan to meet after work ~5:30/6:00 p.m.  Hope to see you there..

Jason, 

Maybe this will clear things up a little:

The monthly data (files ending w/ US) contain monthly data submitted by those respondents required to file monthly survey responses, and ESTIMATES for those other respondents required only to submit one annual survey response.  The data for those files, therefore, also include - for each State - a record for utility ID = "99999" and plant code = "9999" containing data values which represent the arithmetic differences between the "estimated" State totals and the sum of the net generation, consumption, and ending stocks data reported by the respondents to the Form EIA-759. 
The 2001 file will be a "year-to-date" file and is in this Monthly format until the data for the final month is finalized. 

The other files (Annual Data, files ending w/ YR) contain monthly data submitted by those respondents required to file monthly survey responses, and annual data for those other respondents required to only submit one annual survey response. No estimation procedures are involved. 

This only applies to the 759 (Utility) forms.  If you notice, there are only YR files for F759 forms. 

Also, keep in mind that for the 900 Forms before year 2001, the values are in Kwh and not Mwh.  To convert Kwh to MW, divide by 24 hours, 31 days, and 1000...not that you care about generation anyways, but just in case...

Got it?  Hope this helps.  If you need anything else, call this baller up here.   

Have fun in Portland,
J

After several very difficult weeks, Enron announced on Friday that the company has reached an agreement to merge with Dynegy.  

I know that everyone has many questions right now regarding the future of the Associate / Analyst Program.  We are working as quickly as possible with the business units and executive management to determine the future course of the Program.  As the merger points on the Enron homepage indicate (<http://home.enron.com/>), Dynegy has a similar program called "PACE", and the two companies will consider a combination of the two programs.  

Today, all of the business units within Enron will be holding floor meetings to discuss the pending merger and it's implications for Enron.  I encourage each of you to participate in one of these meetings.  

The announcement of the deal with Dynegy marks a significant event in removing some of the uncertainties we've all dealt with over the past several weeks.  As decisions are made regarding the future of the company and specific business units, we will be able to determine and communicate the future of the Program.

New opportunities will be created from the changes that are occurring.  The very best talent from both organizations will rise to the top, and our Associates and Analysts will be a key part of our future success.

I appreciate your continued efforts and patience during this difficult time.

Billy Lemmons
Vice President,  Associate / Analyst Program

R	A basic understanding of how Enron structures deals - the "deal space" and how the financial principals discussed 	relate to 	Enron deals.

I am corrected--thanks.  What do you think about Illinova??  Close to home,
lower cost of living, etc???  From what I understand they are just starting
to get into the energy marketing business.  They might like an ex-enron guy.

      Hey there cheese dick. How's life in H-Town? This is my new work
   e-mail.
      I'm
      doing accounting work at this boat manufacturer. If you're in the
   market
      for
      a nice fishing boat you let me know. Capron filled me in on your

      for a

      don't think gambling would be a good use of my available fundage.
   Tara
      and I
      will be in Houston Nov. 15th thru 18th for Curry's wedding. Plan on
      throwing
      back a few that weekend when we get some spare time. Are you and Beth

Most of you already know, but the move is taking place this Friday 11/16/01.  Please be sure you are packed by 3:00 PM on Friday and  have everything labeled.  They are moving both Power and Gas, so I am not sure what time the building will be open on Sunday or if it will be open at all.  I will get back to you with that information by Thursday.  If you have any questions or need help with anything, please let me know.

Guys:  We want to change the curve mappings for KERN/LasVegas from SOCAL to PG&E/Topock.  However, there are a few term deals that will be affected when we make the change.

Jason:  I tried to look at the deals to tell you more about them, but we do not have access to Canadian deals.  Can you check with the Canadian trader on these three deals to see if we can change the curves ?

452375
459155
434877

Brain:  Can you also have some one run this down from your end.

Thanks

Perhaps, but there are three deals out there with October and forward activity. The deals however; are done by Petro-Canada - BC and
Petro-Canada Hydrocarbons - BC. The deal numbers are 452375, 459155, and 434877.
Let me know what you decide.

All the cap does is keep the bolt clean so if you need to jump start you can
get a good connection on the bolt.  It also keeps someone from accidently
shorting the battery by grounding a wrench or screwdriver, etc.  See ya.

Thanks. My battery cap looked a little different. I will try to take it off
tonight and will take a picture.
It wasn't obvious to me at the time how the cap worked (it wasn't nearly as
clean around the
battery as grandmas). Hopefully no more problems.

   Here's 3 pictures as I see Grandma's car.
   One with the hot battery terminal cap on.
   One with the hot battery terminal cap off.
   One showing where the hot cable from your battery connects to your
   starter.
   Hope they help.

   PS: Let me know if you get these.  I made the files as small as

   but don't know if they are too big to get to you.

Karen,
I worked in ENA West Risk from July 2000 until March 1, 2001, when I began West Logistics. Risk was counted as my first
rotation. Scheduling is my second.

JZA,

You'd better have a warm up game before I get down there...  I should be
playing at least once sometime in the next month.  Maybe I'll learn a new
game or two to teach you guys.

So, just mark it down on your calender right now.  I get into town on June
23 and I fly out the next Sunday.  And Lissa's wedding has been cancelled,
but I will still be haning out with Shelly on Saturday night.  Any interest
in an Astros game on Sunday afternoon, June 24?  I figure you've got all the
connections to get me into JRon field now.  What night are you going to set
up poker for?  I'll be sure to clear my schedule for that night.  Other than
that, I plan on going out to eat a lot and enjoying a few margaritas while I
am in town.

I may need a place to crash a few nights.  I think I am staying with Becky
at the beginning of the week at least, though Lissa has moved in with her
now, so that might get a little crowded.  I'll let you know when it gets
closer if I will be needing a place to crash.  It would probably be good if
I could stay there on poker  night at least.

Oh, by the way:  I'm not black like Barry White, yo I'm white like Frank
Black is.

Alan

GMAT REVIEW AT ENRON

The next GMAT review course at Enron will begin Monday, November 26th:
The schedule is:
     Course # 7019-00:  Monday nights, Nov 26 - Jan 28 (no class Dec 24 or
Dec 31)

This course is identical to the courses that started in October.  It is
being offered now for the benefit of employees who would like to take the
GMAT before January 31 for the purposes of applying to business school.

Course details:
     - Class is held at Enron in room ECN560 and is restricted to Enron
		employees
     - Each course is limited to eight students
     - Meets once a week for eight weeks
     - Hours are 6:00-9:00 PM (first session will run til 10:00 pm to
          include initial exam)
     - Expect 4-5 hours of homework per week
     - Course includes a total of four practice GMAT exams
     - Ends the second week of December, allowing employees to take the
          GMAT in December and meet a January application deadline.
     - Special discount of $200 off the regular Princeton Review tuition

Enron has allowed this program to be hosted in the Enron Building for
convenience of its employees.  Individuals are responsible for paying their
own fees.  Financial support from Enron is at manager's discretion and is
subject to the usual tuition reimbursement constraints around budget and
relevance to organizational performance.


HOW TO ENROLL:
     1.  Print out the attached registration form.
     2.  Complete the form, but please note the following
          SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:
          A.  Fill out the student information completely, including
               your email address.
          B.  In the Enrollment section, where it says "Please enroll
               me in GMAT Class Size-8 Course # _________",
          C.  In the Payment section:  For the course at Enron, the
               tuition is discounted by $200, to $899.
               FULL PAYMENT of this amount by credit or debit card is
required on the registration form.  Be sure to indicate complete cardholder
information.
     3.  Fax the completed form to Princeton Review at (713) 688-4746.

Faxes are time-stamped by the receiving fax machine at Princeton Review.
The first eight valid registration forms received for each course will be
honored.  Registrations received after the first eight will be placed on a
waiting
list for the course or courses indicated.  Enrollments and waitlists will be
confirmed by email.

Employees who are not able to take the course at Enron can take a course at
the Princeton Review office at the same $200 discount.  
Call (800)2REVIEW to register or to receive a list of course schedules.

IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:
     The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business
school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic
that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work
experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of
your application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can
substantially improve in a short period of time.

THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:
     All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA
Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA
Tour, of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business
schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.  The
participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.
The Princeton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so
call
(800) 2REVIEW to register.

November 14, 2001 
On November 11, a fire destroyed the Gerber Compressor Station building on the Redwood Path, and that unit was taken out of service. Pipeline capacity on Redwood Path is reduced to 1,776 MMcf pending station repairs. California Gas Transmission estimates this capacity reduction will last approximately six months.

Beth- 
Here is Kevin's resume...if you can think of anything at your company...or 
if anyone you know is hiring, he is open to just about anything. 
My sister came down this weekend, but I will call you soon and we (Jay

Tamara Muffat, 
Hey girl.  I am sending this email in hopes that you can save me from the 
boredom in which i have grown accustomed to living. 
Attached you will find my resume...if you happen to think about it and 
someone 
is interested, GREAT...if not, no big deal.  I AM interested in ANY line of 
work (even janitorial at this point). 
Well, i hope you are having a great day at work so far and i hope you don't 
miss Matt too much. 
By the way...stu and i had a question for you...you are paying the bills, 
right?  well, if so, that means you have mattie-poo's checkbook.  we were 
wondering if it would be possible to borrow it to go shopping.  We fill it 
is his turn and it would best be served when he wasn't here....more food 
for 
us.  Anyhow, let us know what you think, we could even buy you a few 
things. 
Anyhow, have a great day at work, and you know my phone number if you need 
me. 
Kevin Dikes

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Ken Lay

All, 
This email is directed to my peeps at Enform who may be interested in a 
night at the Alley, 
to see the "international comedy sensation" -  "Art!!!" 
(exclamation points added by me for necessary emphasis) 
Corporate design tyrants like Beth, who just need to relax - it's the 
perfect thing! 
Tyrants-up-and-coming and current princess-wanna-be's: Ashley, it's 
meets your 
faux-high-society sensibilities to a T! 
Posing celebrity-satellites: Matt - it beats hanging out at the 
Starbucks, but requires pants! 
Invite your friends and foes alike! 
Oct 12 tickets are still available, section A, for about $45 a piece. 
Get back at me, playas, 
they're going fast. 
Drinks and the theatre, how do you beat that? 
Whoooooo! 
Jason

Seems to be a consensus among those of you I heard from that Jaliscience is
the place to be tonight. If there are people who think this idea sucks, I am
more than willing to alter plans. But, as of now, we'll meet up at
Jaliscience about 9:00. I'll call Clay when I get into town, so he can be
the go to guy for questions, etc. You're welcome Clay. See you tonight.

Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The information provides further details about:

	-- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge;
	-- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of     three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications;
	-- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties; 
	-- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and
	-- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees.

This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.  As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.  

Restatement of Earnings

Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:

Net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include:

	-- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997
	-- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998
	-- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999 
	-- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000
	-- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001 
	-- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001
	-- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001.  

The consolidation of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.

The restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the nine-month period ending September 2001.

You can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the Form 8-K filing at <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/>.

We will continue to review our strategic, operational and financial position, and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments.

Dave,

What do you know about the NWPL meter 300 (Camas Jr.)? It makes up a fair amount of Portland area load.
It's my understanding that this is industrial, possibly paper mills, but I don't have much more info yet.
If this is a customer you are familiar with, let me know.

Thanks,
Jason

Subject: OfficeMax/Windows XP deal 
Importance: Low 
  
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- 
Hash: SHA1 
There is a pretty good deal going on at Office Max if you plan on 
upgrading to Windows XP Home or Professional: 
If you purchase XP Home (upgrade or full version), for $50 more you 
get: 
Kingston 256MB PC133 SDRAM memory module 
McAfee Antivirus v6 
Spectra Cool-Cam (webcam/low quality digital camera) 
If you purchase the Professional version (upgrade or full), for the 
same $50, you get all the above plus: 
HP Scanjet 2100c color flatbed scanner 
Hi-Val 12x10x32 CDRW 
Then, you get a $50 mail-in rebate (no matter which version you buy). 
 So you end up getting all that stuff for free just for purchasing 
Windows XP! 
My wife went in, asked about the offer, and a few minutes later, had 
the upgrade version of XP Professional and all that stuff for just 
$50, plus the mail-in rebate to get the $50 back!  Not bad...  Even 
if you already have a scanner or a CDRW, they would make great gifts 
too.  :) 
For more info, go to http://www.officemax.com  and click on the 
"Windows XP Exlusive 10-day offer" link on the right-hand side.  The 
deal lasts until 11/03/01.  So if you were going to buy it anyway, 
you may as well get free stuff too.

Ms. Ridinger:

I am an analyst studying industrial gas load in the northwestern United
States
and am attempting to place a number of aluminum plants. I believe I have
the
Northwest Pipeline DRN numbers for 3 of your 4 plants, but am not sure
which meter feeds your Ferndale, WA plant. Also, I would like to confirm
the DRNs
for the other three.
If you, or someone you could refer me to, could provide this information
I would
greatly appreciate it.

Thanks,
Jason Wolfe

		Merchant Development Risk in Power Generation	
		 	
		A Henwood Multi-client Study	
		 	
		Henwood Energy Services, Inc. (Henwood) offers an opportunity to participate in a cutting edge study of the potential collision of coal and gas and its implications for the electric industry as the battle for the fuel at the margin unfolds.	
		 	
The recent rise in natural gas price over the past year, culminating in a price spike of historic proportions in January 2001 has many industry participants reevaluating the role of natural gas as the "bridge fuel" for the twenty-first century. Some observers suspect that low cost gas reserves are tapped out, making reliance on this fuel alone imprudent from an overall portfolio standpoint. 		[IMAGE]	
		 	
		 Currently, there are plans in the works for nearly 40 coal power projects across North America representing 20,000 MW of capacity. Henwood's scenario-based study is designed to cost-effectively enable utilities and project developers assess the regional viability of new, commercially available coal technology using cutting edge screening analysis and their impact on new gas projects.  Participation is limited - sign-up by June 15th to receive the Charter Member price and to participate in the kickoff meeting scheduled for June 20th at the Hyatt Regency Downtown, Houston. Also sign up for the Henwood ERCOT PMA Workshop on June 20th at the same location by calling Jessica Fielder at 916/569-0985.  Click here to learn more about getting in on the ground floor of this opportunity.

   Word of the Day for Monday October 22, 2001: 
   popinjay \POP-in-jay\, noun: 
   A vain and talkative person. 
     One  popinjay  shrieking from the left and another from the 
     right  about  last  week's  headlines  is  not the whole of 
     Washington's   political   dramas.  Occasionally,  American 
     politics is more complicated and more momentous. 
     --R.  Emmett  Tyrrell,  Jr., "Feds Go Drug Crazy," American 
     Spectator, May 26, 2000 
     A  writer  who  appreciates  the  seriousness of writing so 
     little that he is anxious to make people see he is formally 
     educated, cultured or well-bred is merely a popinjay. 
     --Ernest Hemingway, [1]Death in the Afternoon 
     The  dignified, high density of personality of [Clark Gable 
     and   Humphrey  Bogart]  is  completely  missing  from  our 
     popinjay contemporary actors. 
     --Camille Paglia, [2]Salon, March 1998 
     _________________________________________________________ 
   Popinjay  is  from  Middle  English papejay, popingay, meaning 
   "parrot,"  from  Old  French papegai, deriving ultimately from 
   Arabic babagha.

My Romantic Horoscope for Today:
 
The pieces of a two-piece puzzle just don't seem to want to fit together. You've tried countless angles, jerry-riggings and creative solutions, but you keep coming up short. Perhaps the answer, then, is to work with the flaws between the pieces as well as the pieces themselves.

Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview =
of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter=
ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit=
y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=
ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot =
of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=
re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu=
rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve=
r imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=
ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=
tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=
vestor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=
stand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=
iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=
usly reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three=
 areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=
nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th=
ese include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=
r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti=
me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering=
 these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=
.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =
of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =
concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=
mprovement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=
ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the=
 return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =
that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash=
 that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre=
ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th=
ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN=
G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=
s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale=
 is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga=
s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev=
eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete=
rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff=
icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make=
 reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b=
ecomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that =
our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba=
lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr=
edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       "Under Review for Further Downgrade"

-- Fitch at BBB-             "Evolving Status"

-- S&P at BBB-              "CreditWatch Negative"

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin=
 and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1=
0-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. =
19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we=
ll as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference =
call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next =
few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/inve=
stors under "SEC Filings."

=20

=20

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a =
joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commissio=
n. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint pro=
xy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes=
 available, because it will contain important information. Investors and se=
curity holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospect=
us (when it is available) and other documents containing information about =
Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Cop=
ies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will b=
e incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may als=
o be obtained for free by directing a request to either: Investor Relations=
, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) =

ilding, 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 853-3956, Fax: (=
713) 646-3302.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be consi=
dered "participants in the solicitation" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders i=
n connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their d=
irect or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are availab=

Subject:	Competitive Analysis Update- US Attacks Afghanistan #2
Importance:	High

Update below on ground campaign strategy & timing, as well as mounting pressures on Saudi and Pakistani governments. Two reports suggest the ground campaign is underway.   There are also press reports about an anthrax case in NYC--we are investigating and will update as soon as possible.

Call with questions.

RJ
x39934


1.	Afghanistan Ground War Set to Escalate

With a target list thinner than for Kosovo, results from the Afghanistan air campaign five days on have been limited.   But with Taleban fixed defences now softened up, the next phase of search and destroy ground raids, carried out by US and UK special forces and light assault forces, could be imminent.   Insertion will be difficult but various sightings made in recent days suggest to us that the process may have begun.   All our indications are that the US will commit a light division (up to 10,000 troops) and the UK a brigade (about 3,500).   This is a bigger commitment than previously advertised.  More stories along this line may become public over the weekend, even if the Pentagon does not explicitly confirm the action.

Word from Kabul is that Taleban morale is still high and that nightly bombings have prompted some commanders in the Northern Alliance to switch sides, joining the Taleban against the foreign invader.   But outlying Taleban commanders have defected the other way.   There is no clear pattern yet to these changes of allegiance and they may cancel each other out.  And as long as the air strikes remain accurate and clearly targeted against Taleban and bin Laden objectives - which they have been so far - the potential for the Taleban to rally more popular support in Afghanistan seems limited.

When the ground assault starts, from three or four strong points inside Afghanistan, the immediate aim will be to flush out Taleban forces and get them moving so they can be struck from the air.   Such action will be fast and high risk, without much media coverage (with the attendant risk that public support in the US diminishes if the real action is unseen).   If the Taleban can be thus loosened, special forces will then look for Afghans who can take them to the inner core of the Al Qaeda, led by bin Laden and Aymar al Zarawahi.  Depending on how long this takes, there is hope among allied planners that "reasonable elements" in the Taleban regime can be detached to form part of a broad-based coalition to run Afghanistan under supervision.   The Northern Alliance on its own is definitely not the answer.

2.	Saudis Feeling Increased Pressure

Refusal by Crown Prince Abdullah to allow Tony Blair to visit Saudi was only one manifestation of current nervousness in the Kingdom.   The tally of small, isolated violent incidents and attacks on Westerners in the interior is beginning to mount.   We have specific information moreover that leading Saudis who have not in the past paid money into Al Qaeda's coffers are now being 'advised' to do so, on grounds that they will not wish to incur Osama bin Laden's future displeasure.

Washington and London say the motivation for Abdullah's decision was well understood but both believe it was a mistake.  The points which Blair would have raised in public have been made by the British Ambassador in Riyadh to his Saudi hosts privately but it was the symbolism of the Prime Minister meeting with the King and the Crown Prince which London and Washington wanted to see.   Blair was particularly galled by Abdullah's blunt refusal to accept the visit when the two men spoke on the phone, particularly as it was the one blot on his most recent schedule of achievement.

3.	Pakistan Holding Steady- For Now

Popular unrest in Pakistan is real but amplified by media coverage.   Even in Peshawar we are told that 'playing to the cameras' has become a distinct element of the protest.   Musharraf meanwhile, having reshuffled top military and intelligence appointees, maintains both his grip and a wary eye on any signs of a split within his own ranks.  Our assessment is that he is controlling the situation - just.

4.	Key Issue for U.S. and Arab allies- Wider War?

There is also a distinct sense in Washington that major decisions are approaching.   This is not just the imminence of ground troops being deployed in Afghanistan, but the much wider question of the stability of Pakistan, the Gulf including Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Turkey being put in some jeopardy.   Those who have thought through these issues say they are prepared to risk it.   As long as action against terrorism concentrates on Afghanistan, the leaderships of most of these countries believe the situation will remain manageable.   But if it were to spill over, there could be difficulties for these regimes.

Mark your calendar-- 
	the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is moving to a new administrator!

In preparation, here are a few things you need to remember.

For All Savings Plan participants, Friday, October 19 at 3:00pm CST will be the last day to:
?	Request a loan or a loan payoff so that funds can be allocated or distributed in time.
?	Request a withdrawal (In-service or Hardship).

For SDA Participants, Friday, October 19 at 3:00pm CST will be your last day to:
?	Make trades in your Schwab SDA brokerage account so that we can move your holdings in-kind. 
?	Re-invest any Schwab mutual funds into your choice of funds  - the default will be your money market fund.

Other transactions, such as Contribution Rate Changes and Investment Fund Transfers, will continue until 3:00pm CST on October 26.  

EnronBenefits... keeping pace with your lifestyle.

Over the past few weeks we have held several "Breakfast Club" meetings to update members of the Program and business units leaders on the results of the recent Program Survey, to discuss several initiatives we have underway, and to provide an opportunity for Q&A.  

I want to invite any of you who may not have been able to attend one of these four meetings, to a final meeting on Tuesday, October 30.  The meeting will be held in EB 5C2, and will run from 7:30 to 8:30 am.  A continental breakfast will be provided. 

Because space in this room is limited, please rsvp to my assistant Maxine Levingston by 12:00 noon on Monday, October 29.  Maxine can be reached by email at Maxine.E.Levingston@ENRON.com <mailto:Maxine.E.Levingston@ENRON.com> <<mailto:Maxine.E.Levingston@ENRON.com>>.

of my pants!

That said, perhaps I can get more casual...
It's tough for me to get away for lunch, with my new gig, but
your companionship is the break that refreshes. We need
some quality time.

Also, I've heard from Ellwanger, who is cleaning boats. He offered me
a raw, water washdown. And I don't own a boat.

I will  take a look at the Sandals Resorts and let you know.  I am not talking  about real cheap.  I told them that a vacation would be around $2000  for just 5 days and additional wedding costs will be at least $1000 if not  more.  I guess their ideal budget would be around $3000, but if this is not  feasible then they can budget for more.
 
Thanks  again!

Now  that there is non-stop service to Jamaica,  it is a good  choice.   Many of the resorts have wedding plans offered.  I  know for a fact that the Sandals Resorts have wedding/honeymoon plans.   November will be cheaper than January any place tropical.  Check the  internet for Sandals weddings.  I doubt that it will be cheap, but the  resorts that offer weddings are your more upscale  destinations.

Hi Marilyn, 
I am helping a friend plan an "away"  wedding.  I was wondering if you knew of or would suggest any resorts  that have full wedding services that we can start looking at.  They  want simple wedding and are going to invite their close family and friends,  but are not sure who will be able to come yet.  I am thinking it will  probably be about 10 people.  They definitely want something tropical  and probably all-inclusive would be best.  I had a friend who got  married in Playa de Carmen, but I'm not sure which resort.  I was  thinking somewhere in Mexico would be good but definitely not Cancun.   They are on a tight budget because they will be paying for it  themselves.  So here are the details about what we are looking  for:
Tropical All-Inclusive Resort  
Round trip airfare  
Travel date between November 2001 and January  2002 (what time is cheaper?)  
Wedding Services including someone to perform  the ceremony, flowers for the bride, photography, location for ceremony  (possibly on the beach), location for reception for about 10 people (can  be restaurant at the resort) 

I couldn't discuss this on the phone because it  is my coworkers boyfriend and I who are planning it and she sits right next  to me.  If you could give me a list of resorts we will look over them,  narrow it down, and then get back to you.  Thank you so much for your  help!

The house was about six thousand dollars less than the "pool" house... 
it was built in 1996. There are other houses in the neighborhood that are also nice... (included some that are exactly like mine... kinda sucks but its cookie cutter type plan)....
Anyway... I'm starting inspections and appraisals on it now... and expected close is the third weekend in June. 
We had fun last night... it was more of a date type thing. Went and listened to the band for about 35 or so minutes then went to WIllie G's and had a nice dinner.
What are you up to this weekend??

Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. 

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An "Alliance MX turret quick reference guide" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as "Caller ID" and "Voicemail Indication".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:
 
Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	
Weather Channel	12401	801	
CNN Headlines News	12402	802	
CNN Financial News	12403	803	
CNBC	12404	804	
MSNBC	12405	805	
Bloomberg	12406	806	
Financial News Network	12407	807	
CNN	12408	808	
Fox Sports	12409	809	
ESPN1	12410	810	


Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network "in-building" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible "Plug n Play" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.

Keeping an Open forum
We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com

 On a more relevant note, Jason, drop that hamster. 
I will not be attending any alley sessions with you ghetto freaks. 
Why we are not playing AOE today, I do not know.

All, 
This email is directed to my peeps at Enform who may be interested in a 
night at the Alley, 
to see the "international comedy sensation" -  "Art!!!" 
(exclamation points added by me for necessary emphasis) 
Corporate design tyrants like Beth, who just need to relax - it's the 
perfect thing! 
Tyrants-up-and-coming and current princess-wanna-be's: Ashley, it's 
meets your 
faux-high-society sensibilities to a T! 
Posing celebrity-satellites: Matt - it beats hanging out at the 
Starbucks, but requires pants! 
Invite your friends and foes alike! 
Oct 12 tickets are still available, section A, for about $45 a piece. 
Get back at me, playas, 
they're going fast. 
Drinks and the theatre, how do you beat that? 
Whoooooo! 
Jason

Your new cash books are being set up ASAP.  They tell me they will be ready no later than tomorrow.
Once those are set-up, Stephanie Sever will email you your new EOL id's.

Hello fellows! I realize this is late notice, but I figure you guys don't
have very thrilling lives, so I thought I'd give it a shot. Tara and I will
be in H-town this coming weekend for a friend's wedding. I'm in the wedding
party, so I won't have much free time, but I just realized that we get in
Thursday night at 7:30, so that leaves a window of opportunity for drinks or
a late dinner or something that night. Our flight gets in to
Intercontinental at 7:30 and we have a car rented, so I figure we could be
ready for action by 8:30. Let me know what you all think. Am I forgetting
anybody that I like who's left in Houston? If so, invite them. Significant
others are encouraged to join. Actually, in every case here, they are more
welcome than you, I just don't have their e-mails. (Clay, this doesn't apply
to you. You are the focal point of my visit. Oh, and by the way, thanks for
letting us stay with you while we're there.) But seriously all, Tara and I
would love to get together with everybody. Hope it works out.

Eric

I realize that the timing of the Enron Net Works All Employee Meeting last Friday made it difficult for the Gas Logistics Team to attend.  For future all-employee events within ENW, we will try to schedule times that work best for all employees.  I didn't want you to be left out in this case, so I have worked with Bob Superty to set up another meeting for the Logistics team so that we can share with you the information that was covered last Friday.  I hope that you will be able to join me for this second meeting.  We have two videos that were made for the all-employee meeting that I think you will enjoy seeing.  We will also review the slides that were used in the discussions and have time for questions and answers.  

			ENW All-Logistics Meeting
			Friday, October 12
			2:00 to 3:00 PM

 Guess who can't go buy an X-Box because he's at work and can't leave...

Victory is such sweet bliss. 
Thanks for playing the victim Beth and Jay.... 
It was noble of you. 
I wanted to let you guys know... I got battleground galactica last 
night... I was up until 1:30 this morning playing an extremely warped 
version of Age of Empires. 
As for a review... it is rated "OK" at this moment in time. There is so 
much crap.... I couldn't figure it all out. The coolest part is the 
addition or air units... x-wings and tie-fighters... etc. etc. It brings 
a new point of attack into the game... you can build as many "stone" 
walls as you want... they're not going to hold back the air attack. 
The bad thing is... everything is more bulky... more cluttered... and 
slower (in my opinion)...anyway... I think Jay should have gotten his 
copy too. 
Hairy Potter is on Friday... anyone up for XBOX on Saturday?

November 21, 2001 
Due to the unplanned outage of the Gerber Compressor Station, California Gas Transmission's maximum system inventory limit is capped at 4,500 MMcf. Because the outage was a force majeure event, this upper limit will be in place immediately. The outage is expected to last approximately six months. 
Today's maximum system inventory limit is already 4,500 MMcf because total system demand is low. If total system demand increases above 2,800 MMcf, the maximum system inventory limit would normally be raised to 4,600 MMcf. Instead, it will remain at 4,500 until Gerber can be brought back online.

Though many of you already know, today is my last day here at Enron.  I am leaving to pursue my culinary interests full time and have accepted a baking/pastry apprenticeship with the Deer Valley Resort in Park City, Utah for the winter season.  

I am happy to have spent the past 3 years working with such a fun and intelligent group of people. I sincerely wish all of you the best in your future endeavors.

Please don't hesitate to look me up if you are in the Park City area, vacation planning, or considering some radical career change like this...ha.  It would be great to see old friends up there.  Forwarding info is below:

Hi Jason,
When you have a chance, would you please email me a list of issues that you have with the Flexible Deal View.
I will get the lists to Bill Fortney and ask him if there's anything he or we can do to fix it.

Thanks,

Victory is such sweet bliss. 
Thanks for playing the victim Beth and Jay.... 
It was noble of you. 
I wanted to let you guys know... I got battleground galactica last 
night... I was up until 1:30 this morning playing an extremely warped 
version of Age of Empires. 
As for a review... it is rated "OK" at this moment in time. There is so 
much crap.... I couldn't figure it all out. The coolest part is the 
addition or air units... x-wings and tie-fighters... etc. etc. It brings 
a new point of attack into the game... you can build as many "stone" 
walls as you want... they're not going to hold back the air attack. 
The bad thing is... everything is more bulky... more cluttered... and 
slower (in my opinion)...anyway... I think Jay should have gotten his 
copy too. 
Hairy Potter is on Friday... anyone up for XBOX on Saturday?

I bet his attire at the inauguration will be fly.  He will probably wear a fila sweatsuit with a large cross or medallion around his neck.

When I saw this, I new that the dark Republican years would be over by 2004. Is their anyone more qualified
in the areas of foreign policy, energy policy, political economics, or complex social issues than the Rev?

A man walks out of a bar, stumbling back and forth with a key in his hand. A cop on the beat sees him and approaches. "Can I help you sir?" 
"Yesssh!Ssssshomebody ssshtole my car!" the man replies. The cop asks, "Where was the car the last time you saw it?" "It wassssat the end of thissshkey!" the man replies.About that time the Officer looks down to see that the man's weineris hanging out of his fly for all theworld to see. He asks the man, "Sir, are you aware that you are exposing yourself?" Momentarily confused, the drunk looks down woefully at his crotch, and, without missing a beat, blurtsout "SON-OF-A-BITCH... THEY GOT MY GIRLFRIEND, TOO!"

This E-Mail is directed toward current users of Adhoc VaR (Value-at-Risk) within the RisktRAC application.

The purpose of this E-Mail is to notify users that the Adhoc VaR function within RisktRAC will be discontinued shortly and replaced with the Adhoc VaR function on the RAC website.  This is part of the continued migration from RisktRAC to the web-based version.  

Adhoc VaR will cease to function within RisktRAC on June 30.  You may begin using Adhoc VaR immediately on the website and becoming familiar with it if you are not already doing so.  

A PowerPoint is attached which demonstrates how to access the RAC website and how to use Adhoc VaR within the website.

Some users may be set up for RisktRAC but not for the RAC website.  If you are a current user of RisktRAC and are unable to access the RAC website, please contact me with the following information:

	1)  Your name
	2)  Your network login name  (but not your password)
	3)  The commodities you have responsibility for 


Thanks,

Subject: Russian posters auction

===8<==============Original message text===============
I recently won two of your auctions. One is 5 posters, one is 18. I am
excited
about these posters, but I have a couple questions. Are the 5 posters in
the first
set completely included in the set of 18? If so, is it possible to get
any non-duplicates
that you may own in the same theme that will not be doubled up in these
sets?

Thanks for the product.
Jason

 Dear Beth and Allan,  I've really missed playing AoE with you guys, and 
then I failed to get my cross-cultural conquest on over the weekend, so 
I'm real withdrawal--even though I get bored of it after a week of solid 
play.  It would be so great if we got together tomorrow when Allan 
doesn't want to play Roge Spear and John wouldn't show up.  That would 
be like ... my dream. 
-Matt 
PS. Allan, I suck at Rogue Spear.  At least in AoE, I get to suck as 
part of a cohesive, pan-national military short-bus.

jason,

West EOL deals now show Blanco data (and will show Needles data once deals have been made for it)

I am working on the SoCal EHR + SoCal Topk + Needles stuff, and will keep you updated on my progess.

Thank you for your patience and contact me with any additional questions and/or requests.

Dearest Trav, 
Saturday night was really special.  I've never had a five-way before, and it was surprisingly comfortable.  Thanks for setting up that TV for me to watch next to where the real action was going on.  Most guys wouldn't have done that for me.  You're a wonderful guy, and I'll be sure to invite you to all my upcoming multipartner fests.
Still sore, 
Matt 
PS. Please pass on my thanks and accolades to you're gorgeous bikini-clad girlie and that hot dog.

----- Original Message -----
       A language instructor was explaining to her class that French nouns,
       unlike their English counterparts, are grammatically
       designated as masculine or feminine.
       "House," in French, is feminine - "la maison."
       "Pencil," in French, is masculine - "le crayon."
       One puzzled student asked, "What gender is computer?"
       The teacher did not know, and the word wasn't in her French
       dictionary. So for fun she split the class into two groups appropriately
      enough, by gender, and asked them to decide whether "computer" should be a
      masculine or feminine noun. Both groups were required to give four
      reasons for their recommendation.
        The men's group decided that computers should
        definitely be of the feminine gender ("la computer"), because:
         1. No one but their creator understands their
            internal logic;
         2. The native language they use to communicate with
            other computers is incomprehensible to everyone else
         3. Even the smallest mistakes are stored in long-term
            memory for possible later retrieve; and
         4. As soon as you make a commitment to one, you find
            yourself  spending half your pay check on accessories for it.
       The women's group, however, concluded that computers
       should be masculine ("le computer"), because:
        1. In order to do anything with them, you have to
           turn them on
        2. They have a lot of data but still can't think for themselves
        3. They are supposed to help you solve problems, but
           half the time they are the problem; and
        4. As soon as you commit to one, you realize that if
           you'd waited a little longer, you could have gotten a better model.

Dear Jason Wolfe, 
It has been a while since we spoke about your driving needs. Our inventory has changed since then and I realize your needs may have changed as well.
We can still have the vehicle you originally were interested in within 24 hours and we also have some that are similar with similar equipment, only less expensive. Toyota has special financing rates available on Corollas, Tundras, 4Runners and 2001 Siennas. We have great deals on 2002 Camrys.
If youd like to revisit our inventory, please click here www.smccalltoyota.com 
I look forward to hearing from you soon.
Regards, 
Joyce Mbiu

This article about a stolen Ronald McDonald statue is much funnier when you don't read the article, just take the pictures in the order that they appear, and create your own story.

this is an old one but a great one.
If you dont like this email, then you just don't understand.



A chronology of events for Saturday,  December 4, 1999,
and the early morning hours of Sunday,
December 5, 1999:
6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and
Texas Fight at
full-freaking blast
6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels

7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the
FIRST tee-time
of the morning)
8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer)
8:53 Crack open second beer
8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea)
10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as
beers), sign
scorecard for smoooooth 95
10:35 Headed for San Antonio
10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and
post-game
festivities
11:10 We decide we don't have enough
booze, so we
double-back to a liquor store and buy
the good ol' 750
ml plastic bottle "Traveler" Jim Beam
11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot.
Awesome day. Not
a single cloud in the sky. About 70
degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick
the shit out
of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to
go fuck
himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way
to the
Alamodome. We're on the second floor of
a two-story
parking garage on the corner (a couple
hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like
wildmen. The band
doubles back to the street right below
us and
serenades us with Texas Fight and The
Eyes of Texas.
AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity,
50-100 grown
men are bumping chests with one
another, each and
every one of them now secure and
certain of the fact
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the
way to the
Alamodome. Again, we hoot and holler
like wildmen.
Again, the band doubles back and stops
right below us
to serenade us, this time, however,
with the Nebraska
fight songs. Although somewhat
impressed by their
spirit and verve, we remain convinced
that we are
going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome,
somehow
managing to stuff the "Traveler" and 11
cans of beer
into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by
Nebraska fans. They
are taunting me. I am taunting back,
still certain
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska. I
decide to challenge a particularly
vocal Nebraska fan
to play what I now call and will
forever be remembered
as "Cell-Phone Flop Out." Remember flop
out for a
dollar? The rules are similar. I tell
this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in
his team, he
should "flop out" his cell phone RIGHT
NOW and make
plane reservations to Phoenix for the
Fiesta Bowl.
And then I spoke these memorable words:
"And not
those
damn refundable tickets, either! You
request those
non-refundable, non-transferrable
sons-of-bitches!"
He backs down. He is unworthy. I call
Southwest
Airlines and buy two tickets to
Phoenix,
non-refundable
and non-transferrable. Price: $712. He
is humbled.
He lowers his head in shame. I raise my
cell phone in
triumph to the cheers of hundreds of
Texas fans. I am
KING and these are my subjects. I
distribute the 11
beers in my pants to the cheering
masses. I RULE the
pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence,
I open the
Traveler and pour my first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling:
Nebraska is big.
Nebraska is fast. Nebraska is very
pissed off at
Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends.
9 yards
total offense for Texas. Zero first
downs for Texas.
I'm still talking shit. I pour
another stiffy from
the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first
half: the
Traveler is a dead soldier. I buy my
first $5 beer
from the Alamodome merchants. While I
am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates
Major
Applewhite
and rolls out of the end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas
0. I wish I
had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska
fan in the
bathroom at halftime, I attempt to
revive the classic
Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
"Hey, buddy,
niiiiiiiiice cock." He is
unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from
the Alamodome
merchants. I share my beer with two
high school girls
sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they
are equipped
with a flask full of vodka. I send them
off to
purchase $5 Sprites, so that we may
consume their
vodka. I have not lost faith. Nebraska
is a bunch of
pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting
behind me have
fled for their lives. I purchase two
more $5 beers
from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I
am beginning
to lose faith. This normally would
trouble me, but I
am too drunk to see the football field.

5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: "I'm
sorry, sir.
Those tickets have been confirmed and
are
non-refundable and non-transferrable."
5:37 I try to start a fight with every
person behind
the concession counter. As it turns
out, the
Alamodome has a policy that no beer can
be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the
game clock. I am
enraged by this policy. I ask loudly:
"Why the fuck
didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA
system??!!"
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in
my chair in
defeat. All of a sudden, the Texas
crowd goes
absolutely nuts. "Whazzis?," I mutter,
awaking from
my coma, "Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?"
Alas, the
answer is no, we were not winning and
we did not
score.
The largest (by far) cheer of the day
from the Texas
faithful occurred when the handlers
were walking back
to the tunnel and Bevo stopped to take
a gargantuan
shit all over the letters "S",
"K", and "A" in the
"Nebraska" spelled out in their end
zone. I cheer
wildly. I pick up the empty Traveler
bottle and stick
my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as
I walk back
to the truck. I would taunt them with
some off-color
remarks about their parentage, but I am
too drunk to
form complete sentences. With my last
cognitive
thought of the evening, I take solace
in the fact that
if we had not beaten them in October,
they would be
playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back
to Austin for
the 8:00 Texas-Arizona tip off. We can
still salvage
the day! I crack open a beer. It is
warm. I don't
care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am
hungry. I go
inside the store. I walk past the beer
frig. I
notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I
wonder if
it's any good. I pull a Zima from the
frig. I twist
the top off and drink the Zima in three
swallows.
Zima
sucks. I replace the empty bottle in
the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the
store. I walk to
where the ingredients are, where the
person usually
makes the sub. There is no one there. I
lean over
the counter and scoop out half a bucket
of black
olives. I eat them. I am still hungry.
I lean
further over the counter and grab
approximately two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the
store
grunting and eating Pastrami. The
patrons in the
store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have
been drinking
warm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn
tunes for over
an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He
suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn
have written
other good songs besides "You're Going
to Miss Me When
I'm Gone" and "Neon Moon" and that
maybe listening to
only those two songs, ten times each
was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I
could just let the
CD play on its own. I tell him to
fuck off and
restart "Neon Moon."
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My
truckmate,
against my loud and profane
protestations, parks on
the top floor of a nearby parking
garage. I tell him
he's an idiot. I tell him we will never
get out. I
tell him we may as well pitch a
fucking tent here. He
ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the
Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle "Neon
Moon" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers
stuffed in
my pants. We're going to kick the
shit out of
Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona
29. I am
pleased. I go to the bathroom to pee
for the 67th
time today. I giggle to myself because
of the
new opportunity to do "the bathroom
Brice." There are
no Arizona fans in the bathroom. I am
disappointed.
I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
"Niiiiiice
cock." No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while
drinking Bud Light
out of a can. Needless to say, they do
not sell beer
at the Erwin Center, much less Bud
Light out of a can.
I am stopped by an usher: "Where did
you get
that, sir?" I tell him (no shit):
"Oh, the
cheerleaders were throwing them up with
those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind
throwing this away
for me?" I take the last swig and hand
it to him. He
is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but
I run away giggling instead. I duck
into some
entrance to avoid the usher, who is now
pursuing me.
I sneak into a large group of people
and sit down.
The
usher walks by harmlessly. I am
giggling like a little
girl. I crack open another can of Bud
Light.
9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid
the usher, I
have lost my bearings. I have no ticket
stub. I
cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the
refs. I am
enraged. I have cleared out the seats
around me
because I keep removing my hat and
beating the
surrounding chairs with it. A concerned
fan asks if
I'm OK and perhaps I shouldn't take it
so seriously.
I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive
"worst fucking
call I have EVER seen," I attempt to
remove my hat
again to begin beating inanimate
objects. However, on
this occasion I miscalculate and I
thumbnail myself in
my left eyelid, leaving a one-quarter
inch gash over
my eye. I am now bleeding into my left
eye and all
over my shirt. "Perhaps," I think to
myself, "I'm
taking this a bit seriously."
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom
peeing. I'm so
drunk I am swaying and grunting. I have
a bloody
napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants
are bloody.
I have my (formerly) white shirt
wrapped around my
waist. I look like I should be in an
episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody
white shirt
back on my body and make my way for the
exits. I am
stopped every 20 seconds by a good
samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me
why I am
covered in blood, but I merely grunt
incoherently and
keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have
located the
parking garage. I walk up six flights
of stairs,
promise that when I see my friend I
will punch him
in the face for making me walk up six
flights of
stairs, find the truck, and collapse in
a heap in the
bed of the truck. I look around and
notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around
the garage, six
whole flights, and no one is moving. I
take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my
friend in the
driver's seat. I lift my head to look
out the bed of
the truck and notice that traffic is
lined up all the
way around the garage, six whole
flights, and no one
is
moving. I am too tired to punch my
friend. I call my
friend a "Stupid fuck."
11:31 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a "Stupid fuck."

11:38 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a "Stupid fuck."

11:47 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a "Stupid fuck."

11:58 I am jostled. The truck is
moving. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck
and notice that
traffic is beginning to move on the
second floor. I
jump out of the truck, walk to the edge
of the parking
facility, and pee off the sixth floor
onto the street
below. My friend looks at me like I
just anally
violated his minor sister. I turn
around and pee
on the front of his truck while singing
the lyrics
to "Neon Moon."
12:11 We are moving. We are out of
beer. I jump
from the truck and go from vehicle to
vehicle until
someone gives me two beers. I am happy.
I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking
facility. We
make our way to my apartment and find
Ed sitting on
the couch with a freshly opened bottle
of Glenlivet on
the coffee table in front of him. We
are all going to
die tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters
of the bottle
of Glenlivet. We decide it would be a
wonderful idea
to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has
to pee. He
walks down the hall to our apartment
and directly into
the full length mirror at the end of
the hall,
smashing it into hundreds of pieces. We
giggle
uncontrollably and leave for
PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs
uncontrollably
at our efforts to enter his club.
"Fellas," he says
in between his fits of spastic
laughter, "I've been
working this door for almost a year.
I've been
working
doors in this town for almost 5 years.
And I can
honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker
mother fuckers than you three.
Sorry, can't let you
in." We attempt to reason with him. He
laughs
harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We
take two
steps in the door and hear "Last call
for alcohol!" I
turn to the group and mutter: "See, dat
wasn't that
fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that
at the
Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium
we
was at today..." We order 6 shots of
tequila and
three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food.
We hail a
cab to take us the two and one half
blocks to Katz's.
The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10
and tell him
to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give
the hostess
$50. We are seated immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried
pickles, a Cobb
salad, a bowl of soup, two orders of
Blueberry
blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a
hamburger, two
cheese stuffed potatoes, an order of
fries, and an
order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all
asleep with our
heads on the table. The waiter wakes us
up. We eat
every fucking bit of our food. Most
of the restaurant
patrons around us are disgusted. We
don't give a
shit.
The tab is $112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman.
She is the
bartender at Katz's. She is not pretty.

MIke,

Attached is the updated summary regarding expansions in the west.  There is only one change - PGT 2003 expansion.  The expansion has now dropped from 230,000 MM/d to 160,000 MM/d due to PPL dropping out.  

Let me know if you need anything else.

Phil

      Ack!! Trying to catch up here after several days of vacation. 
Quite

      meandering collection of emails.  You should get your tee shirts 
and 
   why 
      not go the whole 9 yards and get custom license plates... take 
pride

      your losing streak!!  Unfortunately I don't think I can make the 
game 
      tonight, but Thursday or Friday for an xbox demo would be cool.

 Dear Beth and Allan,  I've really missed playing AoE with you guys, and 
then I failed to get my cross-cultural conquest on over the weekend, so 
I'm real withdrawal--even though I get bored of it after a week of solid 
play.  It would be so great if we got together tomorrow when Allan 
doesn't want to play Roge Spear and John wouldn't show up.  That would 
be like ... my dream. 
-Matt 
PS. Allan, I suck at Rogue Spear.  At least in AoE, I get to suck as 
part of a cohesive, pan-national military short-bus.

Hi Jason!
 I'm sorry I'll be gone to Savanna when you planned to make your trip.
 I hope you'll be able to come with Beth another time this summer and also
come to Dad's retirement Beth is invited also.  Hopefully, you can fly here
in August.
 I'd been planning to call Janice Denny, then we ran into each other at
Wal-Mart yesterday and talked for at least 20 minutes. She asked about you
and she didn't know Jill and Matt had a baby. (So of course, I whipped out
my purse sized photo album.)
 Tonight she called and gave me Matt's e-mail address and I gave her yours.
 Matt and Mistie were here for Jamie's grad. but they had no time to visit
anyone.
 Here's Matt's address: pkpman@hotmail.com
 Love, Mom    P.S. I transferred the 1500. today. Thanks!

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter.

So, are people in your area getting nervous? Is everybody looking for jobs
at other companies? There are only 3 companies left to interview with
through Duke for Tara. Under normal circumstances she could just contact a
bunch of other energy companies in Houston and probably get as good an offer
from one of them, but with thousands of Enron employees flooding the market,
who knows. Tara found out from a friend of hers at UT that a company called
Peabody in St. Louis is willing to hire anybody with experience at Enron.
Sweet Jesus, I could get season tickets!

If there is an Enron next week, she will probably get an offer. Unless we
are owned by Dynegy.
Then I don't know. Either way, don't quit cleaning boats yet.

Receipts at Deer Island serve year-round industrial loads and a small amount
of mostly heating season residential loads, but are augmented considerably
during the off-peak months (May-October) by storage injection requirements
at Mist.

Jim,

I was wondering if you could provide any info on the Deer Island meter off
NWPL (470)? It is a fair amount of load in the area, and I was just curious
if this was mostly residential, or if there is a plant I am unaware of.  I
appreciate whatever help you can provide.  Thanks,

The zone and UNA meter exist in sitara already. Two of the five meters that will be assigned 
by schedulers need to be set up. As it is, the zone is mapped to Socal curves -
but should be PG&E as you said below.

Hey Jason!
Just wanted to say "hi" today. Hope you can come up some other time this
summer.
 I left you a message on your voice mail.
 I'm sending you some photos of Mikayl and the  Mother's Day flower
arrangement.

 I'm hoping Grandma and Grandpa will be able to come to Dad's retirement
luncheon. Dad's secretary asked for gift ideas and Dad wants no gifts so I
told her the office could chip in for a Harley for him. That went over like
a lead balloon.
 Sandy Fleet is coming next week for 8 days. We are going to have such a
blast!
 Dad is grateful that he doesn't have to attend my 30th class reunion. Sandy
and I will go
. We're shopping in Galena on Sat.
 Did I tell you that we put a wood floor in the dining room? It looks
beautiful! Next, we are planning to add a bottom layer to the deck in the
form of a stone "floor".
 Dad may work on it when we're in Savanna but I suspect if the weather is
nice, he will be riding his motorcycle.
 Now if I can emphasize the importance   of a helmet to a safety expert.
(There's a little sarcasm in that footnote.) Sorry.
Have you been shopping for furniture yet?
 Gotta go---my typing is getting atrocious! My typing teacher always liked
me but I know Duane would be cringing now!!
 Love,Mom

	Enron Recruitment Technology is launching a new, easy to use, web-based Employee Referral Program.

	This new site will help you to help Enron find the talent it needs. Referrals are one of the best sources of talent for Enron in terms of quality and fit with Enron's culture. We have found that referrals stay with the company longer and adapt faster than those hired through other sources. This site will help us run a world-class employee referral program with less work and better results. 

	There are also incentives for you. If you refer a candidate who is hired, you could be eligible to receive a cash reward of up to $5,000.

	So help someone accelerate their career, make yourself some money, and help us realize our mission of being the World's No. 1 Company.

	Check out the site - let us know what you think -- we want to hear from you. This application should make referring easier for you so if you have suggestions that would enhance the program, send us an e-mail (Referral.Station@enron.com) or contact the Referral Station at (713) 345-3254, option 2.

	David Oxley

A few relevant points:

2) you may remove and re-don pants at your leisure during the show, but 
you 
WILL arrive and leave suitably dressed. 
3) AoE should be ON tonight, or some acceptable replacement

game playable by 4+ people.

   All, 
   This email is directed to my peeps at Enform who may be interested in 
a 
   night at the Alley, 
   to see the "international comedy sensation" -  "Art!!!" 
   (exclamation points added by me for necessary emphasis) 
   Corporate design tyrants like Beth, who just need to relax - it's the 
   perfect thing! 
   Tyrants-up-and-coming and current princess-wanna-be's: Ashley, it's 
   meets your 
   faux-high-society sensibilities to a T! 
   Posing celebrity-satellites: Matt - it beats hanging out at the 
   Starbucks, but requires pants! 
   Invite your friends and foes alike! 
   Oct 12 tickets are still available, section A, for about $45 a piece. 
   Get back at me, playas, 
   they're going fast. 
   Drinks and the theatre, how do you beat that? 
   Whoooooo!

Please see the attached chart outlining our Confirmation process.  This is the same process that Barry Tycholiz implemented for Origination.  I think it is a great way to verify our booking process.  

Please use the trading books that Anne Bike passed out yesterday.

I'm trying to get a feel for everyone's desire to play PAINTBALL in the next few weeks.  This would obviously not be sponsored by Enron b/c Enron doesn't have enough cash to buy anything right now.

So let me know if you would be interested and, if so, when you would be available to go.   The cost should be around $30-40 a person.

Please forward to anyone I have forgotten or might be interested.

The following games will be out on launch day: 
  4X4 EVO 2 
  AirForce Delta Storm 
  Cel Damage 
  Dark Summit 
  Dead or Alive 3 
  Fuzion Frenzy 
  Halo 
  Mad Dash Racing

Halo's about the most impressive.  Tony Hawk is probably good as well.  I've heard disappointing things about Oddworld.  I played Cel Damage: imagine Twisted Metal mixed with Whacky Races.  Dark Summit will be eclipsed by SSX Tricky, when it comes out.  I don't play sports games and I won't touch anything with the word "Shrek" on it.  Not sure about the rest.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

eSource
eSource, Enron's research group, has experienced an overwhelmingly positive response to the research training which it has hosted.  Participation and interest by Enron employees has exceeded expectations and many classes were quickly filled.  As a result, repeat classes have been offered and new sessions have been added to the program.  In addition to the Lexis-Nexis and Dow Jones classes, eSource has now begun hosting sessions on Piranha (financials and pricing information), Investext (analyst reports and market analysis), Global Access (financials and corporate activity), and Securities Data Corp. (M&A, debt).   eSource has also arranged long distance sessions using interactive web tools for Enron employees around the world.  Watch for e-mails announcing new training sessions, either in Houston or in a virtual desktop mode.

Since our launch in December, the eSearch website has received over 230,000 hits.  The site today offers Enron employees access to 34 electronic databases.  These databases offer the latest financial and business on-line research capabilities in a cost-effective manner.  In this era of information explosion, databases are constantly being reviewed to ensure that Enron's research needs are being met.  If you know of a professionally relevant database that might be added to eSearch, let us know.  Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enron's research needs, eSource is arranging for desktop access to good-old-fashioned libraries too.  Books from public and local university libraries can be located, borrowed and delivered to employees' desks.  This should be particularly helpful for those with more specialized or technical research needs. 

We are also proud to report that at a recent local research conference, Enron's eSource was featured as an industry trailblazer for having invented itself into a combined virtual library and intranet-based research center capable of delivering a broad range of research products and services via the user's desktop.  Attendees from Reliant, Shell, Halliburton and ExxonMobil and others were duly impressed.  

As for the future, watch for Version 2.0 of the eSearch website, http://esource.enron.com, scheduled to launch soon.  It will feature greater functionality and additional content.  Look for new features like "Industry Overviews" and links to information providers like Frost & Sullivan, Country Watch, and World Energy Markets.


IN THE NEWS

Chicago And Its Suburbs Pick Enron, ComEd For Power Deals
06/06/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)-The City of Chicago and 47 suburban communities have decided to divide new deals for 400 megawatts of power between Enron Corp. (ENE) and local utility Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago officials said Wednesday. 
In the largest power purchase agreement in Illinois since the state choose to deregulate the industry in 1997, the local government groups will get 60% of their power from Enron and 40% from Exelon Corp.'s (EXC) ComEd. The municipalities use the power for public buildings and public transportation.
Chicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the renewable target by providing 80 megawatts of power created with landfill gas, wind and other sources. ComEd will also provide the coalition with another 80 megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and Enron will provide the other 240 megawatts. The new contracts are expected to go into effect this year. 
"We used our purchasing power as local governments to get the best price we could and at the same time to promote competition in Illinois. Enron gave us the most competitive price,"  Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said at a press conference.

We are going to go camping in Austin the last weekend of July.  We are 
getting a cabin.  I think Vickye and Billy; maybe Johnye Leigh and Steve? 
 Granny and Papaw and Morgan.  Saturday, we are going to ride a train to 
Burnett and shop.  Do you and Jay want to go?  I am getting it for Thurs, 
Fri, and Sat night; July 26, 27, & 28.  Let me know. 
LOVE

I'm sorry I didn't get back to you right away about the Nextel bill. I 
forgot until just now. Could you either pay it and I'll send you a check, 
or 
mail it to me and I will take care of it. Ergg. Hey -- I am finally getting 
my car fixed. Yeah!

To remain consistent with Enron's directive to improve security access to the building, all Enron Body Shop members are required to check-in at the Body Shop Front Desk and present an Enron Photo ID badge or another form of Photo ID to the Security Officer each time you visit.  To assist our members who participate in outdoor activities during their visit, Security SMART ID tags are available at the Body Shop Front Desk for your convenience.  Simply slide the SMART ID tag through the shoe laces between an eyelet and snap the tag closed.  

The SMART ID tags serve both as a safety identification tag while members are exercising off property as well as provide the security identification verification required when entering the Body Shop.  Each day you plan to exercise outside, present your Enron Photo ID Badge or another form of Photo ID to the Front Desk Receptionist to receive your temporary Security SMART ID.  Your Photo ID will be returned to you when you return the SMART ID tag to the Front Desk at the end of your visit.

IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:
	The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business
school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic
that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work
experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of your
application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can substantially
improve in a short period of time.

THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:
	All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA
Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA Tour,
of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business
schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.  The
participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.  The
Princeton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so call
(800) 2REVIEW to register.

Subject: It's all about the tribe... 
October 14, 2001 
In My Tribe 
By ETHAN WATTERS 
It may be true that 'never marrieds' are saving themselves for something 
better. They may also be saving the institution of marriage while they're at 
it. 
You may be like me: between the ages of 25 and 39, single, a 
college-educated city dweller. If so, you may have also had the unpleasant 
experience of discovering that you have been identified (by the U.S. Census 
Bureau, no less) as one of the fastest-growing groups in America -- the 
''never marrieds.'' In less than 30 years, the number of never-marrieds has 
more than doubled, apparently pushing back the median age of marriage to the 
oldest it has been in our country's history -- about 25 years for women and 
27 for men. 
As if the connotation of ''never married'' weren't negative enough, the 
vilification of our group has been swift and shrill. These statistics prove 
a ''titanic loss of family values,'' according to The Washington Times. An 
article in Time magazine asked whether ''picky'' women were ''denying 
themselves and society the benefits of marriage'' and in the process kicking 
off ''an outbreak of 'Sex and the City' promiscuity.'' In a study on 
marriage conducted at Rutgers University, researchers say the ''social 
glue'' of the family is at stake, adding ominously that ''crime rates . . . 
are highly correlated with a large percentage of unmarried young males.'' 
Although I never planned it, I can tell you how I became a never-married. 
Thirteen years ago, I moved to San Francisco for what I assumed was a brief 
transition period between college and marriage. The problem was, I wasn't 
just looking for an appropriate spouse. To use the language of the Rutgers 
researchers, I was ''soul-mate searching.'' Like 94 percent of 
never-marrieds from 20 to 29, I, too, agree with the statement ''When you 
marry, you want your spouse to be your soul mate first and foremost.'' This 
?ber-romantic view is something new. In a 1965 survey, fully three out of 
four college women said they'd marry a man they didn't love if he fit their 
criteria in every other way. I discovered along with my friends that finding 
that soul mate wasn't easy. Girlfriends came and went, as did jobs and 
apartments. The constant in my life -- by default, not by plan -- became a 
loose group of friends. After a few years, that group's membership and 
routines began to solidify. We met weekly for dinner at a neighborhood 
restaurant. We traveled together, moved one another's furniture, painted one 
another's apartments, cheered one another on at sporting events and 
open-mike nights. One day I discovered that the transition period I thought 
I was living wasn't a transition period at all. Something real and important 
had grown there. I belonged to an urban tribe. 
I use the word ''tribe'' quite literally here: this is a tight group, with 
unspoken roles and hierarchies, whose members think of each other as ''us'' 
and the rest of the world as ''them.'' This bond is clearest in times of 
trouble. After earthquakes (or the recent terrorist strikes), my instinct to 
huddle with and protect my group is no different from what I'd feel for my 
family. 
Once I identified this in my own life, I began to see tribes everywhere I 
looked: a house of ex-sorority women in Philadelphia, a team of 
ultimate-frisbee players in Boston and groups of musicians in Austin, Tex. 
Cities, I've come to believe, aren't emotional wastelands where fragile 
individuals with arrested development mope around self-indulgently searching 
for true love. There are rich landscapes filled with urban tribes. 
So what does it mean that we've quietly added the tribe years as a 
developmental stage to adulthood? Because our friends in the tribe hold us 
responsible for our actions, I doubt it will mean a wild swing toward 
promiscuity or crime. Tribal behavior does not prove a loss of ''family 
values.'' It is a fresh expression of them. 
It is true, though, that marriage and the tribe are at odds. As many 
ex-girlfriends will ruefully tell you, loyalty to the tribe can wreak havoc 
on romantic relationships. Not surprisingly, marriage usually signals the 
beginning of the end of tribal membership. From inside the group, marriage 
can seem like a risky gambit. When members of our tribe choose to get 
married, the rest of us talk about them with grave concern, as if they've 
joined a religion that requires them to live in a guarded compound. 
But we also know that the urban tribe can't exist forever. Those of us who 
have entered our mid-30's find ourselves feeling vaguely as if we're living 
in the latter episodes of ''Seinfeld'' or ''Friends,'' as if the plot lines 
of our lives have begun to wear thin. 
So, although tribe membership may delay marriage, that is where most of us 
are still heading. And it turns out there may be some good news when we get 
there. Divorce rates have leveled off. Tim Heaton, a sociologist at Brigham 
Young University, says he believes he knows why. In a paper to be published 
next year, he argues that it is because people are getting married later. 
Could it be that we who have been biding our time in happy tribes are now 
actually grown up enough to understand what we need in a mate? What a 
fantastic twist -- we ''never marrieds'' may end up revitalizing the very 
institution we've supposedly been undermining. 
And there's another dynamic worth considering. Those of us who find it so 
hard to leave our tribes will not choose marriage blithely, as if it is the 
inevitable next step in our lives, the way middle-class high-school kids 
choose college. When we go to the altar, we will be sacrificing something 
precious. In that sacrifice, we may begin to learn to treat our marriages 
with the reverence they need to survive.

The stream of internet bullshit is never-ending. 
If the FBI had ANY concern about this, we would see it on the news. 
But I heard from a friend's friend that the Taliban hates atheists (like 
myself) most of all, and believes that if you give them lots of money they 
will destroy themselves in an orgy of hookers and cocaine - because they 
are 
immoral, Godless creatures. If you don't do as they say, they will blow up 
your house on the 10th day of the 10th month of this year (like Nostradamus 
predicted). 
Checks or cash (or hookers) can be sent to:

This has been a tough couple of weeks.  I hope that these daily communications on new developments are helping you understand what's happening with our company.

Here's a rundown of events from last week:

	We executed a commitment letter with JPMorgan and Salomon Smith Barney that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  We now have received a total of $4 billion in credit lines, which we will use to pay off short-term commercial debt and maintain liquidity.
	Our Board of Directors elected a new member to the Board - William Powers, Jr., the dean of The University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas.
-	The Board also established a Special Committee, to be chaired by Dean Powers, that will conduct an in-depth review of the transactions between Enron and entities connected to related parties.  The committee is authorized to take any actions it deems appropriate.
	The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) opened up a formal investigation into related party transactions that have been the subject of media reports and the subject of the SEC's formal inquiry.  As I've said before, we welcome this and look forward to working with the SEC to put this matter behind us.
      Moody's lowered our credit rating one level, from Baa1 to Baa2.  Standard & Poor's (S&P) lowered our credit rating one level, from BBB+ to BBB.  Fitch lowered our rating from BBB+ to BBB-.  All agency ratings are investment grade.

Even with what's happening with our company, we have kept running our business as usual, and here's few examples to show you that we are, indeed, doing just that:

	EnronOnline did 5,866 transactions with 302 counterparties on Friday.  Transaction counts remain higher than average.
	EES signed a three-year fixed price agreement with Home Depot to supply power to 115 of its stores in California and 68 stores across Texas.  EES also has exclusive rights to develop energy management proposals for all Home Depot facilities west of the Mississippi.
      EES also signed a three-year energy management agreement with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's four New York City facilities.

Serious issues have been raised in the media and investment community that have put our credibility and reputation as a company in question.  We're taking an introspective look at our business dealings, our core values and our organization as a whole.  We're doing everything we can to deal with the issues that are affecting our company.

And that's where you come in.  Look around you.  Look at the excellence that you and your team represents.  That's the reason we hired you - you're the best.  Now, more than ever, work for Enron and especially for each other.

Thank you for your continuing support of our company and each other.

Yeah!  I am so glad you wrote back.  I can't write much because the free beer starts at 6pm & I can't be late. =)  But, do you know the difference between Origination, Structuring & Transactions?  I got my offer to come back to Enron & those are the areas that Associates rotate through.  I'm not sure I know what those groups do, but it sounds scary!  Anyway, if you have a clue, pass it on to me. =)
How are things with you?  Are you still with Beth?  Are you working crazy hours?  I will write more later, but for now - I am off to Fuqua Friday.....better know as free beer!

Jason, 
I hope this is your e-mail address & that you get this message. We 
hadn't heard from you in FOREVER, so I thought I'd see what you are up 
to. I also have some Enron questions for you. So, if you are still 
breathing, reply ASAP & I'll send you a long, juicy e-mail for your 
reading pleasure. =)

Support KidSave and Help Miracles Happen. Every Summer.
 
Kidsave's  Summer Miracles Program enables orphaned children ages 5 to 11 to travel to the  US and Canada, live with families and attend day camp. The program gives  families who may be concerned about the problems of adopting an older child a chance to meet, get to know and in the best-case scenario, fall in love with a  child. The program gives prospective parents an opportunity to see and evaluate  first-hand the challenges and rewards of adopting an older  child.
 
In 1999 and  2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - 96 percent of  children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 percent of  children who participate in the program find homes easily through the program.  The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work.
 
Kidsave  believes every child deserves a family. We are committed to placing all children  who participate in the Summer Miracles Program in permanent families or  family-like environments.
 
We are looking  for families to host children, and for others who want to help us make the camp  program happen for these 250 children.   As a non-profit organization, Kidsave depends on donations to raise the  money to bring these children here and find them families.  Please call Tonya Hoppe at 281.286.8948  or tonya@tonya.cc to get involved in Houston's  Kidsave program.   


Enron and Kidventure Camps are proud to bring you Camp Enron Summer 2001.  Celebrating our third year, Camp Enron  will once again be providing summer camp for children, ages 5-13, of Enron employees and contractors. 

This year, camp will be May 29-August 10.  Ten, one-week sessions will be  available and families may choose to attend any or all sessions.  Each camp week is Monday through Friday. 

The cost is $150 per week and includes all transportation, field trips and activities.  A deposit of $50 per week is all that is needed to reserve your sessions.   The deadline to register is Monday, May 21.  

To register, log on to: http://www.kidventurecamp.com/camp_enron.htm.   Spaces are limited.

Enron parents simply ride to work with  their children and check them in to the Energizer in the morning with the Camp Enron Team.  Enron Campers are loaded on Coach USA Buses and transported to our nearby camp. At the end of the day campers are brought back to the Energizer for parents to check out.  

It's that easy!

As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

We will be implementing an additional confirm process going forward.  All broker deals will be booked by Risk and placed in TAGG to generate a confirmation.  Before the confirmation is sent to the counterparty, the Enron trader will sign off on the confirm.  All broker deals will be handled this way.

Please generate a new daily summary report of all broker deals by trader in the west region.  This will allow me to verify if the new process is being handled properly.

Anne, please communicate this to your group.

Thanks,
Mike

As you know, we have a new book runner for the west.  I have asked Kam Keiser to go ahead and set up two new books for you guys.  Matt's book will be IM WC Socal, and Jason's will be IM WC Nocal.  These books will be ready for when we move into the new building.  I will transfer any positions that I have to you guys at gas daily mid.  You will make the markets for your own books.  We will address having you guys take the gas dailies in the near future.

Congratulations!  

Mike

Good morning,

In an effort to smooth out some of the problems we have seen in the past, I would like to start getting a P&L estimate from each of you nightly to try to prevent any unnecessary surprises in the mornings.  I will then expect my group to contact you before they leave at night if it is above or below your estimates, or range you give them.  

This will certainly help us all avoid any fire drills the next day. 

If you have any concerns about this please let me know, otherwise, your book admins will be calling you or stopping by your desks around 3:00 daily to get this estimate. 

Thanks,
Kam

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

Subject: Third Quarter Earnings Results

Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.
