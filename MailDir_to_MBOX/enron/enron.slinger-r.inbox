Hey thanks for coming out to see the boys the other night, if you weren't there you missed a good show.  24BOM will probably play with Junco Parker again.  But more important than that is Thursday night at the Medicine Hat Gallery- 18th and Alberta St-  9:00 PM.  Show up and give some support, 24BOM will be recording live that night and it would be great to have some crowd response on that cd!!
 
Thanks again for your support- hope to see you there

Hey kiddies,
 
Well, it's a new year and we're ready to rawk.  In the coming months we have quite a bit going on.  One big high light is Friday March 8th @ the White Eagle with Lawnboys.  For those of you that have never seen them, be prepared for some kickin' down home funky jam grass.  If'n we're lucky they'll bust out some Zeppelin.  More pressing, we've got a show @ Conan's (39th & Hawthorne) this Friday Jan 11th w/ Junco Parker.  Music starts around 9 and we'll be on at 10:30 or so.  We'll be recording live @ the Medicine Hat Gallery on  Thursdays Jan 17th & Feb 7th.  Both shows will start around 9:30 and will only be 45 minutes or an hour, so you'll be in bed early enough for a school night.  We're taking the rest of February off on account of Willie gettin' hitched.  We'll be at the Buffalo Gap on Friday March 22nd.
 
Upcoming non-24BOM show's you may want to check out are: AC Cotton (whiskey rock, straight up) Jan 12th @ Ash Street, The Handsome Family (spooky goth country)  @ the Blackbird Jan 15th, Concrete Blonde (remember high school?) @ Roseland Jan 29th, Jay Farrar (if you don't know him, you should) @ the Aladdin Jan 30th and Leftover Salmon (bring yer weed and yer dancin shoes) @ Crystal Ballroom Feb 1st.
 
We hope to have our live interactive cd available in April.  Word on the street is that Yodelin' Dean and his computer geek friends are putting something cool together.  We'll keep you in the loop.  In the meantime, make sure you visit the web page www.24bom.com <http://www.24bom.com/> to get your daily fix.  And if you can't remember when we are playing, just send an email to showdates@24bom.com <mailto:showdates@24bom.com> , the dates will be delivered to you mailbox!. We're switching servers and updating the page, so watch for some changes.
 
See y'all at the shows!
 
XOXO, 
 
Twenty Four Bitches on Mezcal

Real Time,

El Paso is in the process of calling counterparties and telling them they(EPE) will deal with billing issues directly.  At this point we will continue to market EPE's power.  Hopefully, we will receive a list of counterparties that we can deal with by the end of the day.

As things begin to calm down somewhat after events of last week, we wanted to update all employees of certain organizational and personnel changes that have occurred recently.

Organizational Matters
The Creditors' Committee was formed last week by the United States Trustee.  This committee is comprised of 15 individuals representing various creditor groups including: banks, bondholders, insurance companies and employees.  The Creditors' Committee will be the key point of contact as we reorganize the company and emerge from Chapter 11.  Initially, they will send financial advisors to our offices to monitor any asset liquidations as well as review our cash flow projections.  Ultimately, they will be responsible for approving our reorganization plan as to which assets or businesses we sell and which ones we retain.

>From an Enron perspective, the plans for reorganization have already begun.  Overhead has been reduced dramatically, certain employee retention programs have been put in place and a wider retention program is currently being developed.  We hope to share the wider retention program with you in the very near future.  Furthermore, detail cash flow projections are in their final stages of preparation and will be reviewed by senior management this week.  This will be the critical first step in formulating our reorganization strategy to emerge from Chapter 11 as a healthy company.

By now, you must have heard of "NETCO." This company was formed as a means to maximize the value of Enron's most valuable business, the wholesale energy business.  Certain Enron North America employees have been assigned to NETCO to re-build the North American gas and power business under different ownership.  We will be filing with the bankruptcy court this week proposed auction procedures to allow bidders to bid for NETCO.  It is our expectation that Enron would retain a 49 percent (or perhaps less) non-controlling interest in NETCO.  The NETCO employees would become employees of the winning bidder.  We anticipate this process to reach closure sometime in January.

As for the remaining businesses of Enron, they are all under review as to which ones will be proposed for sale and which ones will be proposed for retention.  This review process will take time as it will require approval of the Creditors' Committee.  We will update you periodically on our process.

Personnel Matters
As a result of our current situation, we have made many personnel changes over the past several months to maximize the value of the organization.

Office of the Chairman - Enron Corp
Jeff McMahon, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has been added to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Corp along with Ken Lay and Greg Whalley.  Among other things, Jeff has been working on the business plan for reorganization in Chapter 11 and is the primary contact with the newly formed Creditor's Committee.

Treasurer - Enron Corp
Ray Bowen was elected to Executive Vice President, Finance and Treasurer of Enron Corp recently.  In this role, Ray is responsible for all finance activities of Enron Corp.  Ray also has the lead role in managing the cash activities of the company on a day to day basis.

Corporate Development
Mark Muller has been appointed Executive Vice President - Corporate Development.  In this role, Mark will work with Enron's various business units on all asset disposals, which will be a key element in Enron's reorganization plan and value preservation.

Wholesale Services
The Wholesale Services group has been reorganized under the leadership of Jim Fallon.  Included in this group are the following businesses, ENA, EBS, EIM and EGM.  As part of the Chapter 11 reorganization, efforts in these businesses will be directed at maximizing value for the creditors as well as determining which businesses or assets will be part of Enron's reorganization plan.

Management Committee Departures
Unfortunately, due to the current financial condition of the company, the following members of the management committee have left the company or will be leaving the company by the end of December:

Michael Brown
Mark Frevert
Steve Kean
Mike McConnell
Jeff Shankman

Additionally, John Lavorato and Louise Kitchen have resigned from the Management Committee to arrange for the joint venture energy activities of NETCO.

We know as employees the uncertainty surrounding the future of the company is unsettling.  Unfortunately, that aspect will not change in the near term.  We ask for everyone's patience and continued support as we move forward through the Chapter 11 process.  We are committed to reorganizing into a strong company once again and will need the help of all the employees to achieve that goal.

FYI -

All trades done on behalf of El Paso will now be directly billed by El Paso. This means three things for us:

1. Format of the model stays the same. 
2. Deals do not go into Enpower.
3. "Counterparty" in the model must show the billing counterparty only (to simplify Kathy's settlement process).

*Per El Paso, please try to market their power through SRP, PNM, PAC, and LADWP only.* These are the counterparties El Paso has contacted regarding our new arrangement. 

Please let me know if you have questions.

Thanks,
Kate

Counterparties who have agreed to our direct bill arrangement with El Paso - PNM, LADWP, TEP, AEP
Counterparties who have not yet decided - SRP
Counterparties who will not trade with us as El Paso - PAC

Subject:	El Paso Status - PLEASE READ

FYI -

All trades done on behalf of El Paso will now be directly billed by El Paso. This means three things for us:

1. Format of the model stays the same. 
2. Deals do not go into Enpower.
3. "Counterparty" in the model must show the billing counterparty only (to simplify Kathy's settlement process).

*Per El Paso, please try to market their power through SRP, PNM, PAC, and LADWP only.* These are the counterparties El Paso has contacted regarding our new arrangement. 

Please let me know if you have questions.

Thanks,
Kate

Hey Slinger,

It looks like Skilling was a 5-star chef at cooking the books.

>From the article:
"By structuring the deals as involving forward commitments to deliver Enron stock, it appears that Enron was able to assure that losses on them would not lead to reported losses, but instead to reductions of shareholder equity that had no effect on the income statement."

 >   Calpine's Credibility Crumbles
 >
 >By Peter Eavis
 >Senior Columnist
 >12/11/2001 06:49 PM EST
 >
 >
 >Calpine (CPN:NYSE - news - commentary - research - analysis) talks and the
 >market walks.
 >
 >The fast-growing power producer received a ton of flak Monday for taking
 >no questions on a conference call designed at rebutting a critical article
 >by The New York Times. Calpine held another call Tuesday -- with the
 >stated aim of discussing talks to renegotiate power sale contracts with
 >the state of California -- and spent more than three hours responding to a
 >range of issues raised by concerned holders and snarky critics.
 >
 >
 >
 >But soon after this marathon gabfest got under way, Calpine stock, already
 >down for the day, plummeted after a series of remarks by executives that
 >the market didn't like. It ended the day down 13% at $15.50, a 52-week low.
 >
 >If Detox had to make a list of why the market biffed Calpine during the
 >call, these would be the reasons:
 >
 >1. Dilution. Calpine executives said they would be willing to issue stock
 >at a low price if cash were needed, and if debt couldn't be issued because
 >it would push the leverage ratio above acceptable levels. (Leverage is
 >here defined as debt to total capital, while capital is debt plus equity
 >and equitylike securities.) The executives didn't say an equity issue was
 >imminent or probable. However, the fact that an offering could be done at
 >a low stock price would make it dilutive for existing shareholders. A big
 >negative. To raise $1 billion at Tuesday's stock price, Calpine would have
 >to issue about 65 million shares, equivalent to 20% of its shares
 >outstanding at the end of the third quarter. Notably, Calpine executives
 >said that they probably wouldn't use an equity issue to pay back a $1
 >billion convertible bond that may need refinancing in April.
 >
 >2. Natural gas assets. Calpine said it could, if it had to, raise $1
 >billion from "monetizing" its natural gas reserves. That would provide the
 >company with cash, but it would put an up-to-date price on the assets that
 >could be well below what Calpine recently paid for them. That might force
 >the company to do a big writedown to equity, which would, in turn, damage
 >leverage ratios. On the call, Calpine executives played down the notion
 >that they may have to do a writedown, saying future gas prices suggest one
 >isn't necessary.

 >
 >
 >3. Earnings outlook. Not only did the company say it may have to revise
 >2002 earnings guidance, but it also showed uncertainty about
 >fourth-quarter 2001 earnings. This looks bad for three reasons. First, it
 >suggests that Calpine has more of its business unhedged than investors
 >have believed, leaving the company vulnerable to the slump in power
 >prices. Second, it will add weight to the argument that a glut of power
 >generation capacity is building. Third, and critically for investors
 >looking for a bottom in Calpine stock, a large cut in the 2002 earnings
 >outlook could make the stock look a lot pricier than it is at multiples
 >based on current Street estimates. Analysts currently expect Calpine to
 >make $2.52 a share in 2002, putting the stock on a bargain-basement
 >price-earnings ratio of 6 to 1. But if earnings were to be half that, the
 >P/E would obviously double to 12, which would actually be quite expensive
 >for a company that faces liquidity constraints that could force it to
 >jettison its growth strategy. If Calpine continues to struggle to clear
 >its name, a floor for its stock price may be book value, currently $9 a 
share.
 >
 >4. Renegotiating California contracts. Although this was the ostensible
 >subject of the call, too little was said on this issue. The company gave
 >no indication of how much business might be at stake and was reluctant to
 >surmise on how much of a hit it might take from recasting the forward gas
 >purchases made to fuel the power production.
 >
 >5. Accounting issues remain. Calpine revealed on the call that it uses it
 >own in-house method to calculate its leverage. This unorthodox method,
 >which adds $700 million paid for a Canadian gas company to equity, makes
 >the company's leverage ratio look lower than it actually is. At one point
 >on the call, a Calpine executive couldn't detail what was added to net
 >income to get to the company's earnings before interest, taxes,
 >depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) number. This is pertinent because
 >SEC Insight, a research firm that reviews internal Securities and Exchange
 >Commission documents, said in a report Tuesday that the SEC had talked
 >with Calpine about the way it presents its EBITDA number in its SEC-filed
 >financials.
 >
 >6. Bank loans and liquidity. Much time was spent addressing whether
 >Calpine can increase the size of a corporate revolving loan to $1.5
 >billion from $400 million. The company said it thought it could do this in
 >early January. But banks that have gotten burned by lending to Enron
 >(ENE:NYSE - news - commentary - research - analysis) may now be scaling
 >back their energy exposure. What's more, Calpine is trying to raise the
 >size of a corporate loan, implying that the funds aren't needed primarily
 >for construction purposes. Could the need for new cash have arisen within
 >the company's trading operations? Calpine said Tuesday that its
 >counterparties weren't asking for more collateral. But if the trading desk
 >is consuming more, then it's even more unlikely that the banks will
 >increase their credit line, considering the Enron meltdown.

To Enron Employees:

We want to take this opportunity to update all current employees of our ongoing plans for bringing our company out of bankruptcy.  

First, to be clear, there are valuable businesses at Enron. We intend to restructure the company and emerge from Chapter 11 as a healthy, albeit smaller, company.

In evaluating each Enron business or asset, we have been asking ourselves two key questions: "Is the business or asset more valuable to the creditors as a going concern that generates positive cash flow, or is it more valuable being sold and turned into cash?"  

We have completed our preliminary analysis and have concluded that the majority of the U.S. assets are more valuable as a going concern.  These include pipelines, power stations and oil and gas properties to name a few.  Many of our emerging market assets are not generating adequate cash and, thus, may be more valuable being sold and turned into cash.

The wholesale trading operation is clearly only valuable with a strong balance sheet behind it.  Unfortunately, Enron does not currently have a strong balance sheet.  Therefore, we are negotiating a transaction whereby Enron would contribute this business to a third party joint venture with a high credit rating while retaining a residual interest in its profit stream.  We believe this is the best alternative to preserve the value of the wholesale business and maintain a cash flow for the remaining businesses of Enron.

We know that everyone is concerned about the recent retention payments made to certain employees.  Let me try to explain our rationale.  As you know, Enron is an intellectual capital business.  Without key people, we go into liquidation.  The wholesale natural gas and power business has been the most profitable business at Enron for the past several years.  It was this business that Dynegy was most interested in acquiring.  Therefore, in early November as the proposed merger was being negotiated, approximately 75 employees related to this business received retention bonuses.  These retention bonuses were paid to employees that were essential to the ultimate success of the merger.

Last week, we took the additional step, related specifically to our bankruptcy filing, of offering payments to approximately 500 employees who are critical to operate our company. These payments came with the condition that the employees receiving such payments stay employed at Enron for a period of at least 90 days.   Seventy-five percent of employees who received these payments were below the vice president level.  The payments must be repaid, with a significant penalty, if the employee leaves the company early.  With these people in place, these businesses have substantially greater value, which will enhance our ability to pay creditors and provide the greatest benefit to all of Enron stakeholders.

The next step will be for us to work with creditors to agree to a retention plan strategy for the remaining employees.  The goal is for this program to provide you with an incentive for you to stay with us while we work our way out of Chapter 11.  We also intend to see if we can work with creditors to develop more generous severance for current employees who involuntarily lose their jobs in the future.  

This is an extraordinarily difficult time for all of us at Enron. With the constraints of bankruptcy and the deluge of reports from the media, it is difficult for any employee to feel certain of our situation. However, our previous and near-term actions are intended to preserve as much of the value of our businesses as possible so that we remain a viable company both in the short and long term. 

Thank you for your patience, your understanding and your continuing hard work and contributions.

Office of the Chairman

I wish I had more time to review this.  Of 62 different elements of the audit, PwC found the CAISO to be "non-compliant" with 31 elements, e.g., no operating procedure, or, more often, in direct violation of the tariff.  Lots of problems were found with the CAISO actual operation in dispatching real time energy, dealing with CERS, and setting the ex post price.---sch

In order for UBS Warburg to timely process your paycheck, I am requesting that all employee's accepting offers return any outstanding forms to my new desk location at  05852 on the 5th floor of ECS (Look for the Hamburg Flag) by noon this Friday  2/01/02.  This will prevent any benefit deductions from having to be "Double Deducted" on future checks.  Please attach a deposit slip or voided check stub to your direct deposit form.  Attached below are the forms needed for payroll/benefits, in case you did not turn these in at Orientation.  Lastly, please verify that your EHRonline home address is showing your current home address because all live checks will be mailed to your home residence. 

    

Thanks, Tony Jarrett

So, I do not know if this will get to you . But if it does- I pulled out of 
the parkingg lot the other night and drove up Beaverton Hillsdale, went left 
onto the street to your house,and I donot have the faintest idea of how to 
get to your house!! Shocking since I am always half crocked! Not meant to be 
funny. Anyway, I should have callled-Do not have your # in my new 
phon-BLAH,BLAH. I was looking forward to not being hammed around you for 
once. So, if you get this(I got the adress off your business card I just 
found in my wallet) WB or call 901-0376. I am extremly embarresed and I am 
sure when you think of me it is not good. But there could be a slim chance 
that you still have one ounce of respect for me. So, if you do , I will talk 
to you soon. I am sorry !!!!! Noelle
