The following change in policy to e-mail and voicemail has just come to our=

attention.  This change in policy limits our exposure.  This type of exposu=
re=20
was discussed at this years management conference in San Antonio, listing=
=20
examples with Microsoft.  The largest impact of this change is your "sent=

mail" retention being reduced to 30 days from the current 365 days.  You wi=

note that if you move your sent mail to a folder it will be retained for an=

entire year which should minimize this impact.  The rationale for the=20
continued longevity in folders is that if you physically move mail to a=20
folder you are making a conscious decision to keep that document.

If you have not dealt with folders please give me a call and I can assist y=
ou=20
on their creation and on moving the documents into them.  Unless I hear a=

concern, this new policy will be implemented on Friday, December 15th.  Our=

These are my thoughts based upon general knowledge of the year and some

I do not see why not.  I would prefer that we have shipped the computers 
before there is any announcement.  Do you have an exact date?  If your 
announcement is before we actually ship the computers, which hopefully will 
be this week, then I would just say something like NALMP has established a 
new relationship with Enron Transportation Services, the pipeline subsidiary 
of the Enron Corporation.  If your announcement is after we ship then I would 
feel more comfortable mentioning some of the details.

Let me know what you think.

Shirley,

Now that we have discussed it, I understand sufficiently to be confident that 
it's good all around for us to participate.  It will alter our procurement 
timing a little if we do delay our overhauls to next year (we would be buying 
the long lead, high dollar stuff this quarter even if we do delay), but it 
seems clear that it is in Enron's best interest to make those slight changes. 

I will let our controller and Finance Manager know what's up just to keep 
them informed.  They may be helpful to us in figuring out how to get the 
rebate to come into GPG through Enron Methanol Company or Enron Clean Fuels.  
I will admit to very limited knowlege of how those transactions take place.

I will also let Debbie Hinkle (our buyer, 281/882-4232) know to expect your 
call about prices we have been receiving from Cooper.

Thanks again, 

Steve

Steve,

Per my voice mail today.

We would like to offer your operation the opportunity to receive 12% rebate 
on parts purchased from Cooper.  We have prepaid $1.5MM for parts and will 
receive a 12% rebate.

Other parts of GPG have used about $600K of the pre-buy and we would like to 
role your shutdown requirements into the program.

Please call me as soon as possible and I will answer any questions you have.

Look forward to talking to you.

Subject: ETS Risk System

Rod,
Caroline forwarded me your questions regarding the Risk System so I wanted to 
go ahead and respond since Steve is out this week.

I don't think Philippe requires the level of due diligence that we performed, 
but we were getting questioned on buying a 3rd party product vs. using an 
Enron Risk System.  We did more research and got the other groups involved so 
that they would understand our decision.  I believe everyone is now 
comfortable with our purchase decision.

In our analysis of systems, we selected the Caminus product in part because 
we had several individual references from Arthur Andersen, Deliotte &Touche 
and Ernst & Young.  These organizations, especially Arthur Andersen, have 
audited this application and have actually participated in numerous 
implementations.  Ernst & Young recently selected Caminus for Equitable 
Resources.   Arthur Anderson implemented the application for Conoco and 5 or 
6 other companies, and Deloitte Touche recently selected the product for 
Tractabel.  After talking with individuals from these accounting firms, we 
felt very confident that the product was sound, and we should not have audit 
concerns.  Obviously, we have a lot of business procedures that have to be 
established, and there is time in the work plan to do that work, but a lot of 
those decisions drive how the application is configured so we need to get the 
product purchased work through the details of how we implement the new 
business procedures since the system does drive a lot of processes. 

Regarding costs, we have an approved work order for $650,000 which covers all 
the initial hardware, software, implementation costs and first year 
maintenance.  This cost does represent a very limited implementation with 
only 10 concurrent users, no customization except a few reports, and no 
electronic interfaces or data conversion.  The assumption is that initially 
the volume would be so low that an automated interface may not be cost 
justified, and the data would manually be loaded since it was low volume as 
well.  The on-going costs are estimated at approximately $100,000/year.  We 
did not perform a separate cost/benefit analysis as this was in the original 
cost of the Revenue Management RAROC.  Let me know if you have any other 
questions or there are open issues that we need to address prior to 
completing the contract.  We are hoping to get this signed and the project 
underway next week.  Thanks.

Subject:	Mkt Affiliate Implications: Reorganization of Houston and Omaha Facilities Management Responsibilities   



Enron Energy Services is presently a marketing affiliate of several of the Enron pipelines because EES: (1) buys/sells gas; and (2) holds transport contracts on our pipelines.  

Under the FERC's standards of conduct, the pipelines cannot: (1) share transportation information or shipper information with EES; (2) must function independently and keep separate books and records.  Generally, I don't see the FERC having any problem with mechanical, electrical, air-conditioning types of services.  However; there are 2 specific concerns that arise with respect to the described arrangement under the FERC's marketing affiliate standards of conduct:

1. Records -- FERC has ruled that giving a marketing affiliate "access" to transportation and shipper records (including something as simple as file room access) is deemed to be impermissibly sharing the information with a marketing affiliate in violation of the standards. Thus, it seems to me that EES will explicitly not be able to perform any records management function for NNG, TW or NBPL.

2. Billing -  FERC scrutinizes intercompany charges carefully.  In a recent Kinder-Morgan consent order, the FERC used payroll and intercompany charge records to make the case that the pipeline and marketing affiliate did not operate separately.  It would be helpful if any EES facility management charges/allocations come from Enron Facility Services (not EES) --  leaving us room to argue that the facility management subsidiary involves separate functions and staff than the EES subsidiary that is a marketing affiliate.

Subject:	Reorganization of Houston and Omaha Facilities Management Responsibilities


Responsibility  for daily operations of building support services in the Enron Building, Houston leased offices, and Two Pacific Place (Omaha) will be transitioning from Corporate to Enron Energy Services (EES) by year-end.  The areas affected include facility operations and maintenance of mechanical, electrical, and air-conditioning systems; mail delivery;  housekeeping;  food, copier, and records services.

This transition of services, as presently managed by Enron Property and Services Corp. (EPSC), is designed to optimize value to Enron's Business Units by leveraging facility management businesses now offered by EES to their commercial customers.  EPSC staff having administrative responsibility for these services will report to Enron Facility Services, a subsidiary of EES's Global Energy Services group led by Daniel Leff, President and CEO.

EPSC is responsible for Enron's internal real estate and office development needs, including leasing, space allocations and facility planning, project and construction management, furniture systems, and office relocation.  EPSC, in its development role, remains a part of Enron Corporate Administration Services (ECAS) along with Corporate Security and the Aviation Department, reporting to Bill Donovan, Vice President, Corporate Administrative Services.

This alignment of responsibilities offers the opportunity for EPSC to focus resources on effective utilization of our existing office space assets and managing the development of Houston's new Enron Center Campus project.

The cash flows for 2001 are currently locked, but if we get a chance to 
adjust for carry forwards we will.   Worst case is that the dollars will have 
to be reapproved as outside of the budget.     Likely that we will be able to 
do some internal moving of dollars to compensate for this, but not guarenteed.

Subject: Revenue Management Expenditures

While talking with Kim and Martha a question was asked  on capital budgeting 
for Revenue Management..  The question has to do with carrying over 
previously  approved dollars from 2000 to 2001.

The facts ($millions) :

2000 Revenue Management Budget:

$5.7 - Original RM Phase one approval
$(1.0)  In July 00, this amount was approved to spend in 2001 (in the 2001 
budget as a line item)
$4.7    Expected expenditures in 2000 for Phase one.


$(1.0) Current assessment of money not needed for Phase one deliverables 
(estimated, may still change)
$3.7     Amount  approved  with current work-orders
$  .8     Possible amount to be carried over and spent in 2001 
$2.9     Phase one amount to be spent in 2000


2001 Revenue Management Budget:

$ 1.0   Phase one approved carryover  (in 2001 budget)
$  .8  Estimated additional carryover   (not currently in 2001 budget)
$3.0 Phase two   ( in 2001 budget  in the Marketing Pool)
$ 4.8  Total to be  spent in 2000

Question:  
Since the $.8 was approved and is covered in the existing work-orders, can 
this be additive to the 2001 budget without any further approval - even 
though it is not currently a line item in the 2001 budget?  Or does the  $.8 
have to be offset against the Marketing Pool?

If this $.8 does go against the Marketing pool of $15.0 million, will the 
revenues generated from Revenue Management  reduce the revenues generated 
from the pool?  In other words If the capital dollars from the pool are 
reduced because of RM will the revenues also be reduced?

Rod,

After receiving feedback from both yourself and Phil Lowry through George 
Wasaff, we will cancel this meeting. Originally Peter Buettgen and I were  
anticipating the need to share the details of our process assessment strategy 
with you prior to our kickoff. However, it has been pointed out that Morris 
has been identified as the lead player and has responsibility for all 
decision making. Therefore we will be working directly with Morris and will 
not burden you with details unless Morris feels appropriate.

Thank you for your support and commitment in the completion of the iBuyit 
process assessment.

I would think we can do the same as we do in Florida, which is similar to 
your suggestion.     We did create a non-regulated affiliate to do the 
business in the name of, but that leaves the revenue in the venture and 
solves the fiduciary problem.

Subject: Re: O&M Fees at Interconnects  

For O&M fees at interconnects NBPL has been charging the customer an 
estimated incremental cost, which under the cost of service tariff was 
credited back to O&M (where the incremental costs were originally charged).  
We are definitely going to change this now.

In at least one situation in the past, NPNG had the contract for maintaining 
a short lateral for the Synfuels plant in ND (in fact Phil may have been 
involved with this when he was District Manager in Glasgow).  In that case, a 
small amount of O&M was left at NPNG and the revenue was booked at NPNG.  

In most cases the customer is negotiating the fees as a part of service on 
NBPL and I would suggest that unless these are significant contracts the 
amounts be left at NBPL.  The main reasons are accounting ease, avoidance of 
fiduciary issues, and customer relations.

In other similar situations where Operations has had an opportunity to 
provide a service for a fee, we have been looking to EAMR as the entity to do 
the work.  Does the NBPL sitiuation preclude EAMR from taking on this role?  
I would assume, unless there has been a change, that given the fact that NBPL 
does not have any employees it would be difficult for NBPL to provide the 
service.

Subject: O&M Fees at Interconnects

The issue of O&M fees at new interconnects has been raised by several 
customers.  A meeting to discuss this issue and how Operations will determine 
these fees, is scheduled for Monday, December 18, on your calendar.  Your 
input is very important at this meeting.

Several of NBPL's customers are currently waiting for answers on this issue 
and NBPL needs to respond very soon to these customers.  NBPL has been asked 
to renegotiate fees (PGL&C) as well as set fees for a period of longer than 1 
year (Harvest States).  NBPL has also been asked to operate a 1/2 mile of 
line from a meter station to a power plant (Lakefield Junction).  We need to 
agree on a decision from both a business and an operations perspective.  
Currently, we have estimated operating fees at interconnects where we charge 
a fee and charge a standard monthly fee of $2,000 per month with the 
exception of two interconnects.  With the tariff changes, operating fees will 
not automatically be recovered in the future.  How are these operating fees 
going to be tracked and charged?  Does NBPL charge all interconnect customers 
the same fee?  Should NBPL absorb some or all of the operating costs as a 
cost of doing business?  These questions need to be answered at the meeting.

Thanks!

Would you immediately initiate an audit of the time sheets and payroll for Mike Woolery - a shift operator at the Garner, IA location?   It appears that his payroll has been wrong since the implementation of the SAP system in July of 1999.

If this proves to be as he states, we need a complete audit of this system, especially for all shift operators and possibly all employees, especially those that are non-exempt.

JIM CARLSON----  I agree with Mike Woolery in him memo below, that we need to have a knowledgable person perform an audit of Mike's entire payroll from the beginning of the SAP payroll system initiation.  Who do I talk to to get this rolling.  Once the audit is complete, we need to sit down with Mike W. and other concerned Shift Operators to review findings and proposed remedial actions to eliminate this type of thing in the future.  I know that Terriann has met with knowledgable SAP administrators and changes in the payroll process have been initiated recently that, hopefully, should address future problems of this nature.

We are still working on the plane, and the answer is that the plane will be 
billed to the RC reserving it for the flight.    If commercial wants to take 
it to a lower level than that it will be up to them to do so.     It will 
take some actual doing on our side to make this happen, but it can be 
done.     The budget will be taken care of in Planning as we go through the 
year.      From an ETS point of view all of the plane is in Commercial or 
Executive (Stan) and so it should not be a problem to track the budget.   
Tracy has the point on this one.

Jim Saunders:    What do you know about the other comments?

Rod--

I never heard back from you on this airplane accounting issue for year 2001.  
Any thoughts on timing as to who we can work with to finalize by year end?   
Can we work with Dave Waymire here in Omaha??

Also,  there was an article in  this past  Sunday's World Herald that   FASB 
has reversed its position on merger accounting and will not require firms to 
amortize Goodwill  over time and  write it off against current income of a 
merged company.  In addition, the new plan would eliminate the  "pooling of 
interest"  restrictions and allow merged companies to sell off unwanted 
assets prior to the two year waing period now required.  I'm not sure if this 
revision would be applicable to mergers which occurred before this FASB 
revision or not.  

Do you have any insights on this???

Thank You.

Subject: Accounting for plane usage in year 2001

Rod - we have discussed the accounting for plane uasage on year 2001 and have 
determined that  the actual trip costs will be billed direct to the user's 
RC.  However,  the 2001 budget costs for the plane have been included in Dan 
McCarty's executive RC budget.  Thus, we will have to develop a procedure to 
charge the RC for atctual costs, but credit the plane budget and maintain 
some control as to the overall status of the budget.

Who would you like me to work with to develop/coordinate these procedures?

Thanks!

Subject: Insurance Claims

Attached is list of the outstanding insurance claims provided to us by Risk 
Management.  As I indicated to Rod yesterday, I have been informed that the 
premiums that were paid this year were $15,000,000 and given the claims 
submitted at $43,000,000, Corp is looking for a way to mitigate anticipated 
rising premium costs.   They are looking very hard at Hawkin's Audit Program 
to help them out.  As this list indicates, International assets should bear 
the brunt of future costs.  The Transwestern train derailment will be about 
$700,000 ($200k for repair and $500k for buisness interruption), both of 
which will ulitmately be reimbursed by the railroad.

Dave needs to step up to the plate and start delivering some new and creative 
solutions for outstanding issues.  He has the capabilities.   It seems he 
tends to manage too much by wandering around and not taking the lead.

I fully support Barney's rating, but could see both Dave and Larry's ratings 
being on the lower edge of the recommended ratings.

I will do all I can to shore up the organization by placing some expectations 
for improvements before the whole group and dividing up the accountabilities 
accordingly.

I fully support what you have recommended.

These are my thoughts based upon general knowledge of the year and some

lead me to believe that he would think I might be being too generous on

Subject: Lease Option on Trailblazer

To recap our recent discussion, my understanding was that you were looking 
for an Enron or NBP entity to serve as the lessor in a lease financing 
transaction that would be offered as an option in the pending EAMR bid for 
the Trailblazer construction project.  Since such transaction would need to 
be priced based upon the credit rating of the entity or the sponsors 
(depending upon the structure) the expected returns will not justify the 
balance sheet impact on Northern Border Partners if this entity were to 
function as lessor.  Furthermore, I have assumed that this conclusion also 
holds true from Enron's perspective given their strategy of reserving balance 
sheet capacity for higher return projects.

Since the bid parameters do not specify a lease requirement, Trailblazer may 
already have funding in place.  If not, EAMR could insert language in the bid 
that they or their designee would arrange lease financing for the project 
upon selection of EAMR as the winning bidder.  At that point, we would work 
with commercial banks or major leasing companies to develop a cost-effective 
financing transaction.

I hope this addresses your questions regarding the feasibility of such a 
transaction, but please call me at x7843 in Omaha if you wish to discuss 
further.  Good luck with your bid!

is done, dates and measureable objectives but it is a start.     Please feel

The Market Service Team has reviewed their requirements for the proposed 
relocation of ETS within the Enron building.  Under this plan, Gas Control 
would not move from their current location and the Market Service Teams would 
be in close proximity to Transactional Marketing and Facility Planning.  
Julia's intent is to have discussion with Danny to make sure the 
organizations are aligned to support the commercial teams.

To begin the process of thinking about what is needed to plan our space for 
the future, we need to pull together some very simple information from each 
of you.   Please provide the following to Rod Hayslett or to me as soon as 
possible:

Number of work spaces by category:
 Office
 Cubicle/work station - high walls
 Cubicle/work station - low walls

Number of additional work spaces (visitors, auditors, etc.)

Number of Conference/Team Rooms:
 Small (4-6 person)
 Medium (7-12 person)
 Large (more than 12 - please specify)

File Rooms: Specify the linear footage of file space required and/or list 
special requirements for maps, etc.

Special:  Model Office
  Computer Rooms/Cold Rooms
  Map Tables and/or walls
  Writable walls
  Video Conference Equipment/Connections
  Other

Also, please identify one person from your organization that can be used for 
coordination purposes. For instance, Rod Hayslett will assign Kathy Campos 
for his section.

Thanks for your help in this effort!
