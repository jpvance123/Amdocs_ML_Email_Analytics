 Clean Air/NOx Briefing for ENA:  On Monday 8/28, Environmental Strategies 
held a detailed briefing on Clean Air/NOx regulations for the ENA East Power 
Desk, which resulted in several ongoing projects.   Over 40 people, including 
Kevin Presto (head of trading), almost all the traders, all analysts, and all 
fundimentals (IT, information) staff were in attendance.    Mary Schoen 
pulled the presentation together and addressed financial impacts of the 
regulations on power markets. Jeff Keeler gave background, history, and 
future timelines regarding NOx and other air regulation.   Gus Egnheim and 
Marc Phillips  assisted with technical questions related to control 
technologies.   The meeting  concluded with a discussion of strategy going 
forward, and a project to assist ENA in a detailed analysis of the effects on 
power plants and markets in the NOx SIP Call states.   Kevin Presto (who is 
also responsible for running the peakers) indicated that it may be more 
preferable to sacrifice some of our peaker interests and develop a strategy 
that supports state and EPA efforts that increase costs as much as possible 
on our competitors.   This will be an ongoing strategic effort  to add value 
to ENA.

   Texas Renewable Energy Credit Comments:  Enron led a group of companies 
that generate, trade and market renewable energy and environmental advocates 
in filing joint comments on issues related to the implementation of a 
Renewable Energy Credit ("REC") trading program in Texas.  Stacey Bolton  led 
drafting efforts on behalf of the group, and worked within Enron to 
coordinate our positions.  The program is consistent with positions we've 
taken, in that attributes of energy can be traded separately from its energy 
source.    The group recommended changes that would lead to consistency and 
adaptability, including comments about what information should be included on 
the credit's "label" and a recommendation that any environmental disclosure 
requirements be developed in conjunction with the REC trading protocol.

Pipeline Safety:   We continue to monitor the legislative climate following 
the tragic El Paso pipeline eruption and fire in Carlsbad, NM, in which 10 
people were killed.    While the widely-held perception among industry is 
that the accident will have a negative effect on the legislation, information 
from Capitol Hill continues to indicate that the legislation will not likely 
become more burdensome -- there is just a greater likelihood that it will 
receive attention and an effort will be made to pass something this 
Congress.   It is expected that the full Senate may act in the two weeks 
after Labor Day weekend, but that the House still may not be ready to move 
legislation through committee and to the House floor until later in 
September.  INGAA is recommending hiring an outside lobbying firm to assist 
in efforts going forward, due to the thought that many companies will not 
want to be active or visible in lobbying this issue because of the El Paso 
accident.  Jeff  Keeler will investigate the climate on Capitol Hill further 
before Enron signs off on this strategy.   In addition, Stan Horton will be 
in DC the week of 9/5 to attend meetings at DOE and Dept. of Treasury, to 
talk about the possible impacts of the accident on energy markets and the 
economy.   

In addition to advising GPG, we have been providing information and analysis 
to ENA Competitive Analysis, who is advising ENA management on the effects of 
this legislation on gas and power markets, so that we may take advantage of 
opportunities that arise.

 Climate Change:   Jeff  Keeler has been providing information on various 
climate change proposals to Enron South America, who will be engaging in a 
dialogue with Brazilian environmental regulators over Enron's involvement or 
interest in Joint Implementation and Emissions Trading programs.

Georgia NOx SIP Regulations - Marc Phillips attended a meeting with the 
Georgia Environmental Protection Division regarding their development of 
non-attainment NOx transport rules in Georgia to gather environmental 
intelligence for ENA/EES project development.

Houston Non-Attainment regulations - Marc Phillips is attending a meeting 
with other pipeline companies to discuss preparing industry comments 
regarding the proposed Houston non-attainment regulations and the emission 
limits on reciprocating engines that could have a $30 - 40 MM impact on GPG 
operations over a three year period.

Enron Ergonomic CBT -  Russell Tucker received and approved the release 
candidate short version of the Office Ergonomics CBT CD-ROM and should have 
final copies from manufacturing for the 20 administrative level employee  
workstation egronomic pilot testing during the first week of September 2000.

API Task Force Review For ANSI Z365 Vote - Russell Tucker has reviewed the 
extensive changes made by the Accredited Standards Committee  for the Z365, 
"Control of Cumulative Trauma Disorders" proposed ANSI consensus standard as 
a member of the API Task Force deciding the issues.   Russ submitted comments 
directly to the Committee on behalf of Enron. 

International Emergency Response Contractors - Completed the list of 
emergency responders.  Report submitted to Mike Terraso on August 31.  A 
meeting with Don Hawkins GPG, serving as Corp Emergency Response  
coordinator, will be scheduled for next week to present the list and discuss 
next steps.

EHS Indirect Report Staff Meeting - Mike Terraso met with the  EHS management 
indirect reports ,environmental legal and conferencing in with Jeff Keeler in 
Washington, NEPCO in Seatle.  The meeting reviewed 2000 objectives status; 
current federal legislative issues and  shared cross company information.

EES/OEC Federal Services -  Mike Terraso, Henry Van and Susan Worthen met 
with Don Hawkins to review EHS asset support services for EES/OEC federal 
services.

Friends of Earth - Mike Terraso, Kelly Kimberly and Lauren Goldblatt  are 
meeting with FOE in Washington on Friday to initiate stakeholder dialogue on 
biodiversity  in response to FOE proxy statement at last the  Enron 
shareholder meeting.  Other NGO's attending Conservation International, World 
Wildlife Fund, World Resources International.

Contractor Safety Awareness Program - Corp EHS (S.Watson, H. Van, M. Terraso) 
in cooperation with Bill Donovan's group conducted initial building 
contractor safety awareness program for contractors performing demolition/ 
buildouts in the Enron Building.

Earth Day 2001 - at the request of Cindy Olsen, Mike Terraso met with Missy 
Stevens (community relations) to review Enron Earth Day 2001 initiatives.

GHP - Business Council for Clean Air - Mike Terraso participated in review of 
a clean air technology verification proposal presented to Greater Houston 
Partnership Business Council for Clean Air.  The program would substitute 
emission reductions gained through accepted technology to lessen the impact 
on mobile and stationary air emission sources in the eight county Houston 
non-attainment area. The project would be performed in time for a mid-course 
correction of the Texas SIP.

Texas Nature Conservancy - M. Terraso and John Shafer (GPG VP EHS)  met with 
Robert Potts, Texas Nature Conservancy director and Nigel Homer, National 
Nature Conservancy to review potential cooperative employee educational and 
community service activities programs for Enron.

Cuiaba II - Joe Kolb was not able to participate in the conference call this 
week.  Mid-September is key date after which work on the compressor stations 
is expected to begin in earnest.

Cuiaba Pipeline - Joe Kolb is trying to contact David Runte to verify 
information in the monthly report and is currently planning a trip to Bolivia 
with Edgar Zuleta to inspect and review project-related issues first hand. 

Construction BMPs - Bob Moss has not heard received any comments from Jerry 
Martin or his staff.  Regarding the fiber optic component of the BMPs, Joe 
Kolb has not been able to discuss the project with Herb Caballero.   Bill 
Osborne has distributed the pipeline BMPs to Shafer, Ryther, and Steenberg 
for their comments.  He hopes to get their feedback this week and then take 
it on to others within GPG.

Greenfield Risk Mangement Project - Documents that lay out sequence of 
environmental aspects of major capital project development are nearly 
complete.  The one for GPG is being reviewed by Bill Osborne.

Recycling Committee -  Wayne Lei has sent info on PGE's recycling program, 
which Joe Kolb provided to David  Ronkainen.  Joe Kolb conducted an informal  
small energy conservation survey on 3AC 15 and found that 53% of the 36 
office credenza lights and 35% of the 110 cubicle lights were left burning, 
plus 3 computers, 1 radio and 1 fan.  If we decide to promote energy 
conservation in our downtown offices, the impact should be something that can 
be estimated by doing before and after surveys on a few floors.

Isagen Privatization, Colombia - Don Stevens provided an environmental due 
diligence scope of work to Mario Brunasso, Development Engineering, who will 
forward it to a local engineering consulting firm.  Due to high security 
risk, Enron has elected to hire Harza for the full scope of the due 
diligence.  The privatization includes hydro and thermal generation and 
transmission, accounting for over 30% of Colombia's energy supply.

Project Dragon, Asia - The Environmental Schedule of the Share Purchase 
Agreement was circulated for review by Bruce Lundstrom, APAChi Legal.  Copies 
were forwarded to Frank Smith for comment.  The lenders have begun their due 
diligence in Hong Kong and key discipline leaders are on standby to answer 
questions.  A TransitionsTeam may be deployed in October/November.  This deal 
is still very confidential and Enron Asia power plants and personnel do not 
know anything.

ENEL, Nicaragua - Don Stevens has requested Ramiro Garcia to review proposed 
legislation for Nicaragua to assist in the evaluation of its potential 
impact.  The proposal is very stringent and does not have much chance of 
success; however, Enron has learned some of the other bidders are addressing 
capital costs associated with the potential requirements.  The bid date is 
October 12.

Annual Report - Many technical and management problems have plagued the Image 
Center's pdf of the Annual Report.  Gavin Dillingham succeeded in the posting 
and publication of the final edition.  Hard copies will likely be ready next 
Friday for distribution to Executive Staff.

Valuation Exercise - Susan, Henry, Jeff, and Marc all provided input on the 
EHS value to Enron exercise.  An additional meeting was held with Gia to 
explain some of the tasks.

EES/Eli Lilly Deal - Susan Worthen participated in several meetings with both 
EES and Eli Lilly to learn more about the scope of services and EES' EHS 
management system.  A more detailed meeting with EES's Enron Building 
Services Inc. group will be held next week.  An EHS briefing has been 
scheduled for September 13 to answer Eli Lilly's environmental due diligence 
questions.

The DC Circuit Court of Appeals has extended the date for states and sources 
to comply with the EPA's NOx SIP Call regulation to May 2004, from the 
original May 2003 date.

Background

Back in May 1999, a federal Court stayed the NOx SIP submittal deadline for 
States, pending the final outcome of the NOx SIP litigation.   After the DC 
Circuit Court decided the case in March 2000, EPA asked the court to lift the 
stay on the NOx SIP submittal for States and give the states the same amount 
of time they would have had to submit their SIPs, had the stay not been 
imposed in the first place.   Industry sources opposed lifting the stay, and 
also asked the court to move the complaince deadline back a year, due to the 
delays caused by the litigation.

The Court lifted the stay on June 22, 2000, but was silent on the issue of 
the compliance deadline.  States are now required to develop their "State 
Implementation Plans" (SIPs) by October 31, 2000.  

Yesterday, the Court decided that sources should have until May 2004 to 
comply, giving sources an extra year to prepare for the new regulatory regime.

Remaining Questions

With the previous 2003 compliance deadline, the NOx SIP Call regulations were 
on the same time schedule as the Section 126 petitions, which were approved 
by EPA (though a separate regulatory process -- a nearly-identical fallback 
to the NOx SIP call) for many of the same sources and states as the NOx SIP 
Call.   The Section 126 Rule is going to be litigated starting this coming 
November, but the Court has not yet issued a stay of those regulation, nor 
has it delayed the compliance deadline to 2003.   Unless the Court places a 
stay on the 126 Rule and delays the compliance deadline to 2004, sources 
could still be required to make substantial NOx reductions starting in May 
2003.   We expect the Courts to resolve this issue sometime before the 126 
litigation commences in early November.

Enron Activities

SIPs are being developed by the states, with a deadline of October 31, so 
Environmental Strategies will be spending the next few months working to 
ensure that the rules that are crafted in the states provide the most 
favorable treatment possible for our assets while providing a competitive 
advantage to our traders.   While the delay could benefit some Enron assets 
that need to comply with the regulations, it could also benefit our 
competitors, who have another year to defer environmental compliance 
decisions that would likely increase their costs and create other 
disadvantages for them.

on the meetings the intrastate pipeline association is having with TNRCC on 
grandfathered engines. Companies have the ability to obtain air permits for 
grandfathered emission sources under a voluntary (VERP) program in Texas. 
TXOGA is not involved in the meetings and does not support them. It was 
agreed that more industry groups, including INGAA, should be involved in the 
discussions.

Dabhol Power Plant Water Well Contamination - ThermoRetec continues to 
conduct aquifer pump tests at selected monitoring wells to gather 
characteristic data on the acquifer behavior to evaluate contaminant 
transport.  

Henry Van and Bal Wong are coordinating a trip to India to work with Dabhol 
Management to develop an action plan for the groundwater issues and the EHS

Steve:  

Lisa Jacobson passed on to me your request for some info on our latest multipollutant proposals.  I have attached several documents for your review.   Because this issue and the Administration's review of "New Source Review" (NSR) regulations have been receiving a lot of attention lately, I thought I would provide a brief summary as well.  I also think it would be a good idea to have a meeting with you, Rick and Linda at some point before September to make sure you all understand the proposal and our strategy.

Enron's Multipollutant Proposal

Last year, Enron led formation of the "Clean Power Group" coalition, which currently includes NiSource, Trigen, El Paso, and Calpine.  The group developed a proposal on multipollutant regulation for the power generation sector (details attached) and has been working to get the White House, EPA and members of Congress to adopt this approach early on in the formative stages of legislation.  

 We have received strong interest on Capitol Hill from Moderate Republicans (including House Science Chair Sherwood Boehlert, Senate Environment Ranking Member Bob Smith), and Democrats (including Senate Energy Chair Jeff Bingaman and a number of House Center Democrats).

Also EPA has been very receptive to our proposal.  In recent statements, Gov. Whitman has expressed support for key elements of our approach - national cap and trade programs for NOx, SO2 and mercury in exchange for overhauls of Clean Air Act provisions and NSR.   A recent EPA memo outlining their plan contains many elements of our approach.  In addition, as the White House has come under increasing pressure on environmental issues (due to the wake of the Bonn climate change talks, absence of a domestic or international strategy, pressure from Hill Democrats and environmentalists), we have had increasing discussions with advisors about how our proposal could help solve some of their current problems.

The Administration's consideration of New Source Review reform has been another driver behind activity on multipollutant and traction of proposals like ours, but I will cover that subject in a separate memo.

Other Multipollutant Plans

There are really only two leading industry multipollutant proposals on the table - our Clean Power Group's and the "Clean Energy Group" plan (Sempra; KeySpan; PSEG; PG&E; Conectiv; Consolidated Edison; Exelon; Northeast Utilities).  Key differences from our plan include:  CEG's plan explicitly supports carbon caps - ours does not; CEG's plan proposes drastic emissions cuts rather than our glideslope approach; and CEG's plan for NSR reform is not as ambitious as ours.

Senate Environment Chair Jim Jeffords also has a multipollutant bill, favored by most environmentalists, but considered more of a "placeholder" bill.  Jeffords' bill includes stringent carbon caps, prohibits trading of mercury, and leaves NSR and other Clean Air Act programs intact.   

Jeffords plans to mark up this legislation this fall, at which time our plan and CEG's plan will be given serious consideration.  It is also expected that EPA will come out with its formal proposal in the next few months, so we are working hard to make sure as many elements of our plan as possible are included.

Enron's Strategy

We have structured the Enron/Clean Power Group proposal to address numerous commercial concerns, based on positions we have taken on behalf of commercial groups in advocacy on programs like the NOx SIP call, and based on discussions with commercial groups about problems with Clean Air Act regulation or possible opportunities in structuring new programs.

We are in the process of having more detailed analysis done on impacts of our proposed legislation, but here is an overview from an Enron perspective.  (Note:  multipollutant legislation covers power generation sector only at this point, but could be expanded to industrial, pipeline sources in the future)

Generation Development (ENA and EES):  replaces uncertainty, cost, and delay of NSR, emissions offset programs with emissions trading programs that reward efficiency and new technology.  Provides a level playing field for competition with existing sources, who have used environmental regulation to erect barriers to new entrants.
Emissions Trading Markets (EGM):  replaces patchwork of regional programs (different timelines, different pollutants) with a national cap-and-trade program for each pollutant.  Could provide increased volumes in SO2, NOx markets (more players in system, and more allowances traded nationwide), create new markets (mercury & maybe CO2) and spawn derivative markets (options, forward contracts).
Origination (EES, ENA):  creates more regulatory certainty in NSR which has prevented customers from investing in plant improvements, technologies.
Energy Efficiency and renewables (EES, EWC):  trading program allocates allowances for conservation activities and non-emitting generation sources (to date, most air regulations do not reward renewables or efficiency).
New Technology (ENA, EGM, EES, Xcelerator, Principal Investments):  plan provides incentives to developing new, efficient technologies (power gen, mulit-emissions control) either owned by Enron or under consideration for investment.
Cleaner Fuels (ENA, ETS, EGM):  provides incentives for the use of gas in generation, and for the use of cleaner coal/new coal technologies.  For commodity trading in general, plan would provide greater regulatory certainty about the effects of environmental regulation on power markets.

Just to clarify who's doing what at Enron -- I have take the lead, assisted by Lisa, in working with commercial groups to form Enron's strategy, working with the Coalition to structure our proposal, develop strategy, maintain contact with the EPA and Administration, and perform outreach to environmental and industry groups.  Pat Shortridge has assisted on legislative advocacy (Congress and White House outreach) and political strategy related to our proposal, and has worked with our Coalition to make sure its political activities and strategies are well-focused.

If you have any questions, please call me.  I'll be in touch shortly to see if we can arrange a brief, focused meeting on this topic.

Documents (I apologize for the volume of material, but this is a fairly complex topic) --

Houston Non-Attainment Regulations - Marc Phillips is representing the TXOGA 
Pipeline Committee at a meeting with TNRCC regarding the Houston 
Non-Attainment regulations. After the TNRCC meeting he will attend a meeting 
with TXOGA and the Intrastate Pipeline Association to discuss their 
differences on discussions with TNRCC regarding voluntary controls on 
"Grandfathered" facilities.

OEC Environmental Issues - Marc Phillips, Jim Peterson and Russ Tucker 
interviewed OEC management to discuss the environmental issues that are 
important at the OEC peaking facilities. The Reg Tech Group will use this 
information when reviewing state and federal regulations with impacts on 
Enron.

NEPCO OSHA Compliance - Russell Tucker responded to a request from Tony 
Bolar-Softich,EE&CC and NEPCO Safety Director, for a search of all OSHA 
violations resulting in a fine or proposed fine as a result of inspections at 
any construction jobs in 10 specific locations where NEPCO has upcoming jobs. 
This resulted in information keyed directly for the OSHA Areas Office 
inspection activity for all of the upcoming job locations.  Tony plans to use 
this data to verify compliance within NEPCO for any of the violations of 
record.

Safety Notice on OSHA Policy For Treatment of Employer Safety Self-Audits - 
Russell Tucker sent out a Safety Notice to al Enron safety specialists 
covering the final policy recently released by OSHA describing the Agency's 
treatment of voluntary employer self-audits. This formalizes and clarifies 
the way OSHA may obtain an employer's voluntary self-audits, how they may 
help an employer during an inspection or when discovery may be the basis for 
issuing a willful citation.

Annual Report -   Chairman's statement was finally approved.  Comments 
submitted on 2nd draft copy.  The report will be posted on the intranet site 
under "New and Notable" and on the external site under "  Due to some final 
edits, publication will be either Friday or Monday. (Susan Worthen)

The Ministry of Environment in Ontario released its final emissions trading regulation yesterday.   Based on a quick review, several changes were made that Enron asked for in its submission earlier this month.
 
Specifically:

OPG's allocations will be partitioned through 2007 (not 2010)
Allowances will be allocated on a prospective basis, baned on the previous year's generation (output).  Estimations of energy production will be used (subject to a true-up) to accommodate new generators which come on line during a compliance year.  
Direction and distance provisions that would discount emissions reductions credits (foreign allowances) have been removed.
The SO2 set aside for renewable energy and energy efficiency is raised to 4 KT (NOx --expressed as NO - remains at 1 KT).

There is no restriction on banking of credits.
ERC credit lifetime extended from five to seven years.
Approval of ERCs by the Ministry of the Environment before registration of the credits (rather than after registration but before use).  

Please see the summary of the regulation below compiled by Lisa DeMarco of Donahue Ernst & Young in Toronto.  Environmental Strategies will analyze the regulation and be back in touch with more information on its impact for Enron.  Do not hesitate to contact me with any questions.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
On October 24, 2001, the Ontario Minister of Environment released the final emissions trading regulation which includes several significant changes to the draft regulation. The release of this regulation and an additional regulation governing emissions from the Lakeview generating station is broadly thought to signify the likely opening of the Ontario electricity market in Spring, 2002 (please see attached article).  

A brief overview of the central aspects of the Ontario emissions trading regulation, which sets out a hybrid ("Cap, Credit and Trade") system of emissions trading for Ontario, follows 
 
Applicability: 

Starting in 2002, the regulation will apply to Ontario Power Generation's ("OPG") 6 fossil fuel generating stations.  In 2004, the requirements will be extended to large (>25MW) Independent Power Producers ("IPPs") in the province.  Most notably, the regulation is accompanied by an announcement that caps and the associated hybrid trading scheme will be extended to other major industrial sectors in the near future.  Consultation with those sectors regarding the level of their sector caps will commence immediately. 

Caps: 

NOx (measured as NO): 

An overall cap of 36 KT in 2002 will decline to 28 KT in 2010.  The cap will be partitioned between OPG and IPPs  between 2004 and 2007.  Each year renewable and energy conservation projects will be eligible for 1 KT of "set-aside" allowances.  Starting in 2007, the allocation of allowances will also be subject to a North/South partition to comply with obligations under the Ozone Annex to the Canada / US A Air Quality Agreement.  Trading between these areas is not, however, restricted. 

SO2: 

An overall cap of 157.5 KT in 2002 will decline to 131 KT in 2007.  The cap will not be partitioned between OPG and IPPs and will apply to OPG facilities in 2002 and all large IPPs in 2004.  Each year renewable and energy conservation projects will be eligible for 4 KT of "set-aside" allowances.   

Allocation: 

Prospective allocation of allowances will be on the basis of a facility's pro-rata share of energy production (output) in the province.  OPG will receive a corporate based allocation each year until the end of 2007, at which point all allocations will be on a facility basis.  The proposed mechanism allows for estimations of energy production to be used (subject to a true-up) to accommodate new generators which come on line during a compliance year.  Measurement of emissions must be by CEMs or equivalent technology. 

Credit Creation: 

Emission reduction credits ("credits") may be created in accordance with MOE "Standard Methods" from baseline project emission rates in the year prior to creation.  Specific requirements are set out in the Ontario Emissions Trading Code ("OETC").  Generally credits may be created from any of the following jurisdictions: 

Ontario, New York, Pennsylvania, New jersey, Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, Kentucky, Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia (with possible science-based extension of the eligible jurisdictions) 

In addition, US allowances which are issued by these jurisdictions may be acceptable for use as Ontario credits if they meet the requirements set out in the OETC. 

Early action credits may be eligible for use if they:  meet the requirements of the OETC; were submitted for review by the PERT program before July 1, 2001;  and were created between July 1, 1998 and January 1, 2000. 

Credits will be approved for use by the MOE before they are registered on the Emissions Trading Registry. 

Credit and Allowance Use: 

Use of credits is limited to 33% of allowances used for NOx and 10% of allowances used for SO2.  These limits do not apply if the facility is operating under an IMO must run contract.   

All credits will be subject to a 10% environmental discount.  The ratio of smog season to non-smog season NOx credits must reflect the same ratio of actual emissions. 

There is no restriction on banking of credits.  There is no distance and directionality discounting for the eligible jurisdictions. 
Trading 

There is generally unrestricted trading through the Ontario Emissions Trading Registry.

Yesterday, the European Commission adopted a climate change package, which includes a draft directive on emissions trading, an instrument of EU ratification of the Kyoto Protocol and policies and measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  Please the attached press release outlining the package.
 
Major provisions of the draft emissions trading directive include:


The emissions trading scheme has two phases -- first phase (2005 - 2007), second phase (2008 - 2012) 

Penalties for non-compliance in first phase are 50 Euros per tonne or twice the average market price, whichever is higher; beyond 2008 the penalty would be 100 Euros per tonne or twice the average market price between 2008 and 2012 ,whichever is higher.

Permits are required in first phase for industrial and energy activities covered, chemicals and waste incinerators are not included in first phase (see Annex I of draft directive for the sectors covered)

Unrestricted access to the market by intermediaries

Banking allowed, but could be limited by individual Member States in first phase

National allocation (for free) in first phase, with provisions for new entrants (unspecificed); harmonized allocation rules by 2008

Possibilty to link with non-EU national emissions trading programs by MOU in first phase (aimed at accession states)

Only CO2 emissions are covered in the first phase, expanded to all GHG gases covered by 2008

Renewable energy certificates are not integrated with GHG allowances under the program

Emissions credits not incorporated into program, but desireable in future.  The EC will address this under a separate directive

I will work with Peter, Nailia, Diana and others to further analyse its implications for Enron.

=09Subject:        17/7 - 7:00 p.m. - Update: Emergency=20

=09The situation continues to be stable.  CLHB has reinitated LPG operation=
s to LaPaz, but continue their inspection.  TR will not reinitiate gas or c=
rude export operations until we have completed our inspection.  We have for=
med joint teams with CLHB and Army personnel to perform the inspection.  It=
 could take as long as 48 hours, but we'll have a better estimate after we =
get a progress report in the morning.   All crews available systemwide are =
mobilizing for inspection of the entire system, but for now our priority co=
ntinues to be the lines in the altiplano.  The three stations in the altipl=
ano have been shut down, bled off, and locked.  Other supervisors throughou=
t the system have been advised and are on alert.

=09Government and regulator continue to be supportive of our shut-down and =
inspection action plan.  We have developed a contingency plan with COBEE (t=
he regional electricity distributor) under which they will redistribute ene=
rgy out of spare capacity in Cochabamba to LaPaz  - this should cover LaPaz=
's electricity needs during the duration of time we need to complete our in=
spection.  The only other significant consumer is a large cement plant in L=
aPaz.  We've agreed that they will slow down their operations, and provide =
only small, local supplies (industrial concrete demand will be shut-in).

=09We did not send a press release on the issue, although we have received =
inquiries - our response is that we are concerned about the risk to Bolivia=
ns this action presented, and we are performing an inspection on the system=
.  We are avoiding mention of gas stoppage to LaPaz at this time, due to th=
e volatility of the issue in LaPaz.  Government (VMEH, SIRESE) has agreed w=
ith the message.

=09We expect that with the cement plant and power plant off-line, line pack=
 should be sufficient to keep commercial demand satisfied for a few days.  =
In either event, we are working with the local gas distributor to prepare a=
 notice for LaPaz newspapers instructing gas consumers in the area how to s=
afely shut-down and restart their equipment in the event that it becomes ne=
cessary.

=09The most likely scenario as of now is that Edwin Morales - a local revol=
utionary tied to the coca trade - is behind the action.  Morales has had co=
ntact in the past with the Raul Rocha bunch out of Chuquina (Oruro), so we'=
re still not sure whether this was an act against TR and/or the industry, o=
r if it is against government.  Morales has just joined forces with another=
 rebel out of Cochabamba and is planning nationwide road blocks for tomorro=
w.  Their agenda is national - they've never isolated TR or our industry as=
 a whole, although Chaco in the north have been targeted in the past, proba=
bly because they have a field in the middle of Morales' stronghold.  The po=
litical situation here is tenuous with Banzer out and various political int=
erests looking to fill the leadership void.  We're watching this situation =
closely.  The local Army brigade has committed to staying on vigilance for =
at least the next few days - once we're comfortable with the operational si=
tuation, we'll discuss a longer-term solution.

=09At 1:45 p.m. today, a CLHB line walker discovered a bomb on their LPG li=
ne in the Altiplano 14 km from out SicaSica station.  Our OSSA II (crude ex=
ports to Chile) and GAA (gas to LaPaz) share the same ROW, and would likely=
 have been taken out with the bomb.  We understand that the bomb, which had=
 a manual fuse, did not go off, but had been lit and failed to explode.  Th=
e Army has been mobilized to diffuse the bomb, and we consider the immediat=
e threat neutralized.

=09However, given that we have now seen several attempts in the last 10 day=
s of sabotage against our lines, I have declared a state of EMERGENCY, and =
will notify the Enron Crisis team.

=09We have shut all Altiplano pipeline operations down, and have mobilized =
a joint CLHB/TR/Army team to perform vigilance on the entire altiplano netw=
ork.  The immediate result of this is that lights will likely start to go o=
ut in LaPaz within the next few hours - the GAA line is their primary power=
 fuel supply.  I've notified all relevant government authorities of the sit=
uation, and so far am getting support.  I've also asked the Embassy to look=
 into the situation, with the understanding that if this is the result of a=
n organized movement, they might have access to intelligence that could be =

Methanol plant that I mentioned that  Marc Phillips was preparing  at staff 
meeting a week ago.  If you need any additional information  regarding this 
facility please let me know.   If you consider it valuable,  we could develop 
similar fact sheets for a list of  critical facilities and put them in the 
EHS database for quick retrevial.  Lets disucss this.   Mike

Wanted to give you brief feedback on our efforts to become the 1st Fortune 
500 Company that has a 100% green headquarters.  We've established a 
company-wide team and a working plan going forward, which includes:

1.  EES commodity team is going to run the numbers for energy commodity for 
facilities and give them a proposal by end of next week.  While facilities 
will not be part of the TX pilot, EES can arrange a financial deal for them 
w/ an option of going physical on 1/1/02.   EES commodity team will also let 
the group know of the offer, in order to structure the REC deal.  Depending 
upon the savings that EES can offer to Facilities, we will determine any 
"headroom" for REC purchases.
Note: It is not necessary for Facilities to sign a commodity deal w/ EES in 
order for the "greening" of the building to go forward.  The RECs can be 
purchased and retired irrespective of the commodity deal with EES.  HOWEVER, 
it would be optimum for Facilities to sign on w/ EES and use the cost savings 
toward purchase of the RECs.  Facilities stated intent to do the latter.
2. Michael Payne and Mike Curry are going to be working on determining a cost 
for the RECs.  Michael initially projected $250,000 per year for the 
requisite number of RECs to retire commensurate w/ the demand of the 
building.  This was at a cost of $8 per REC, which I believe is quite high.  
I think they'll go for a $1-4 dollar range, bringing the cost down to a max 
of $125,000.  There's several ways to slice this end.  We can provide some of 
the RECs from the EWC facility and buy other RECs from the market in order to 
minimize the cost impact of the REC purchases.
3.  Next Thursday we will be able to get more of an exact figure on the 
premium cost for the RECs (ie how much over the cost savings will the RECs 
cost).  We will then need to decide the following:
 a. Would Corp/EHS being will to pitch in to cover any additional cost for 
the RECs;
 b. Pitching the idea to Skilling for buyoff, and payment for the RECs;
 c. Possibly getting buyoff from the business units since this could change 
what they are currently paying for power.
4. We discussed all of the above with Peggy Mahoney, and she asked us to take 
a stab at a comprehensive press release announcing all of the bells and 
whistles on the new building and our being the 1st Fortune 500 company to go 
100% green in our headquarters.   Catherine McKalip Thompson is working on 
the first draft.  We need to determine if we can get the "best" press for 
this commitment (i.e. stories in the WSJ and NY Times).  We determined that 
the message would need to be targeted, specifying the terms of our 
commitment....i.e. Enron makes a commitment for 3 years to provide 100% green 
for its headquarters in Houston, making it the first Fortune 500 company 
to.......

The goal is to have a final plan and decision by April 20th when Steve speaks 
to high level executives at a prelude to Earth Day NY on the topic of Energy 
Shock--Crisis or Opportunity: Building Economics and the Environment.

Mike, we'll definitely need your continued support and assistance, 
particularly if this goes to Skilling.  I'll keep you posted on the progress.

You are invited to a meeting next Thursday (3/22) afternoon at 2:00 to 
discuss energy commodity and renewable energy credits for the Enron Building, 
Center and Stadium.  There are a few efforts that are going on simultaneously 
and I thought it would be a good idea for all of us to meet and get on the 
same page.  As many of you might know, Enron Wind (Michael Payne) and ENA 
(Mike Curry) have a great proposal to retire renewable energy credits from 
our Enron Wind facility to match the consumption of the building and stadium 
(details attached below).  If this proposal goes forward, Enron would be the 
1st Fortune 500 company to "go green" in its headquarters building.  Couple 
this w/ our energy star award, and we have GREAT environmental messaging.   
We'd like to highlight this announcement on Earth Day (April 22nd).

The facilities folks are interested in switching from Reliant to EES for 
actual commodity.  It makes sense to work strategically together on win-win 
proposal that will not only make sense economically, but that we can use in 
our messaging.  The focus of the meeting is to discuss the various proposals, 
and steps for moving forward.   

The meeting will be in EB50MO3 from 2:00-3:00. Please let me know if you or 
someone from your group can attend.

villages are currently not hostile.  The subsurface at the plant was found to 
be very fractured allowing the spread of the contamination.  Additionally the 
sea water cooling tower discharge basin and the waste treatment plant have 
overflowed to cause surface water contamination in a stream.  The current 
monsoon season rains have somewhat mitigated the concentrations of this 
contamination. The hydrogeological consultant continues to investigate.

Ecoelectrica -The date for the EPA notice of violation conference has still 
not been set, but is expected to occur in the next two weeks.  Drafts of the 
presentation to be used at the conference are being reviewed.  Marc Phillips 
continues to provide plant personnel assistance in resolving continuous 
emission monitoring equipment and protocol issues.  I have asked Marc to 
prepare a list of actions remaining to be and potential personnel, including 
contract consultants, capable of performing them, in order to set the plant 
on course for compliant operations in the future. 

Pipeline Safety Legislation- nothing new this week.  Jeff Keeler has 
scheduled meetings for Stan Horton today with high level  congressional staff 
and Department of Transportation officials

Marc Phillips discussed a consultants proposal to perform methane leaks 
surveys at 10 to 15 GPG compressor stations in return for potential 
greenhouse gas credits in lieu of monetary payment.  GPG management will 
review the proposal and if feedback is positive Marc will pursue discussions 
with emission traders.

EcoElectrica Power Plant - Marc Phillips will be participating in the EPA 
conference on August 1 in San Juan PR.  Marc has also compiled the Quarterly 
Excess emissions Report that will be submitted to EPA today.

EPA Proposed Acute Exposure Guideline Levels (AEGLs ) - Russ Tucker has 
advised the managers and directors of Safety regarding the additional 14 
chemicals proposed by EPA for inclusion on the AEGL list and has requested 
information from them regarding current usage of these chemicals.

US Inter America Development Bank Meeting - Henry Van participated with EES 
Bruce Stram in an  energy outsourcing presentation to the IAD bank and other 
energy agency management in Washington.  Henry presented the environmental 
outlook in South America and Enron's environmental program and strategy.

 Cuiaba Pipeline Brazil HSE Audit - Greg Marino led the combined Enron/Shell 
safety and environmental inspection of the "ridges" section of construction 
in Carceres Brazil.  Greg conducted a meeting with Enron , Shell, Gas Oriente 
and Cunduto (construction contractor) regarding the nee to develop and 
implement an emergency evacuation plan for seriously injured personnel for 
the "ridges".

Tennessee proposed air SIP changes - Gus Eghneim and Mary Schoen met with the 
Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation to raise serious 
concerns over the latest draft Tennessee SIP , which cuts Enrons allocation 
for NOx allowances 75% from an earlier draft. This would require a major 
capital expenditure for the plants at Brownsville and Gleason to maintain 
compliance.

 Pipeline Safety Legislation-Jeff Keeler brought GPG's VP Pipeline Safety, 
Dave Johnson, to DC to participate in negotiations in the House and Senate. 
Industry has finalized and presented  alternative language that can improve 
the McCain legislation and hopes that this can break the impasse preventing 
the bill from moving to the Senate floor. they are working in the House to 
get a bi-partisan bill that would be much less onerous than the McCain bill.

 MTBE Legislation -  we dodged a bullet this week when the Senate Environment 
Committee canceled a markup of MTBE legislation.   Senators were not able to 
agree on a workable approach, mainly over provisions related to the mandate 
of ethanol as a replacement for MTBE.  It is likely that this issue will be 
considered sometime in September when Congress returns.

 Illinois SIP - Mary Schoen will continue to meet with other IPPs in Illinois 
over the development of the Illinois SIP.   Illinois EPA has recently raised 
concerns about peaking plants, so we are working to make sure our facility is 
not disadvantaged in any way.

EPA New Source Review Enforcement -Jeff Keeler provided information and 
analysis to ENA Downstream origination about a recent "New Source Review" 
enforcement settlement reached by EPA/DOJ and BP Amoco and Koch refining 
facilities.  The 2 refiners agreed to pay fines and reduce emissions at 
several facilities.   ENA is interested in this information as insight into 
what other costs or risks current and potential customers may be facing.

Canadian Power Purchase- Mary Schoen and Susan Worthen continue to  work with 
Jim Steffes regarding environmental due diligence on  ENA Canada's proposed 
power purchase agreement from coal-fired power plants in Alberta, providing 
analysis of environmental regulatory factors that could impact the deal.

 EES California Reporting Error -- Stacey Bolton and the California 
government affairs team will be meeting with the California Energy Commission 
and Center for Resource Solutions (who run the Green-E certification program) 
next week to discuss the errors made in 1999 reporting on "green" products 
EES offered in California.   Enron will present its plan to notify customers, 
present an amended report, send out new labels, and correctly register the 
product.  

National Credit Trading Program:  Stacey Bolton  spoke at the "GlobeEx" 
energy conference in Las Vegas this week, advocating the need for a national 
credit trading program -- a uniform platform by which suppliers can comply 
w/varying renewable portfolio standards as well as provide verification for 
product offerings.  She received positive feedback from several companies and 
environmental groups in attendance, and will continue to lead efforts to gain 
momentum behind this issue.

 Enron Building South Safety- Mike Terraso will meet with Bill Donovan next 
week to review contractor safety plan contingencies.

FYI gents - the meeting yesterday with the Arizona DEQ did not result in significant progress. Basically the agency folks at that level are simply not motivated to engage in any effort to accelerate the permitting.  Local counsel is going to visit informally today with the agency's counsel to see if some progress can be made and attempt to set a meeting with higher level agency personnel early next week.  

Attached is a copy of a hand out that was used at yesterday's meeting.

Corporate EHS Staff Meeting- The first EHS (my direct reports and their 
staff) all employee staff meeting will convene at 8 am Monday September 11. 
The primary objective of teh meeting is to enhance communication and 
awareness within the group.

ENEL - Nicaragua - Don Stevens is currently reviewing a proposed governmental 
environmental regulation regarding on-site landfills and sanitary systems 
which could add increased costs to the project and will supply Orlando Puig 
(Developer) with a short write up on the actions and costs associated with 
the proposed regulation.   

ISAGEN - Colombia - A revised scope of work to cover EH&S requirements was 
provided to Harza Consultants by Don Stevens.  The site visits are being 
conducted by Harza Consultants this week.  No Enron employees will be 
traveling to Colombia due to social unrest.  

Project Inga - ENA East/West - ENA is investigating a stock purchase of 
Ahlstrom Development Corporation's holdings in five coal fired power 
facilities.  Two of the facilities (ACE Generation Company and Mt. Poso 
Cogeneration Company) are located in California.  Three of the facilities 
(Panther Creek Partners, Inter-Power Ahlcon LP (Colver) and Gilberton Power 
Company) are located in Pennsylvania.  ENA has contracted RTP Environmental 
Associates to conduct the due diligence (fatal flaw) and site visits.  The 
site visits will be conducted 9/5/00 - 9/8/00 for the California facilities 
and 9/12/00 - 9/15/00 for the Pennsylvania facilities.  Don Stevens will be 
conducting the environmental review of RTP's report.  The commercial 
objective is to restructure the PPA.

EH&S Compliance Requirements Summary - Susan Worthen is developing the 
Summary with the intent  to provide Enron commercial groups with a brief 
understanding of EH&S requirements necessary in operating a facility.  The 
Summary will be routed to other EH&S individuals within Enron for their input 
before distribution or use in meetings.

Eletrobolt PP (Brazil) - Joe Kolb participated in a conference call regarding 
this project ; another power plant situated immediately adjacent to RioGen 
PP, with some compression on the natural gas pipeline lateral being 
constructed for RioGen.  RioGen and Eletrobolt have different ownership 
mixes.  Environmental impact assessment and air emission modeling are 
critical path issues.

CEP Survey - Susan Worthen and Lauren Golblatt provided information to Gwynn 
Hanmer Gorush (community affairs) for a survey by the Council on Economic 
Priorities.

Enron Methanol Plant Economic Study - Marc Phillips submitted information to 
the Business Coalition for Clean Air (BCCA) regarding the economic impact of 
the proposed NOx RACT rules on the methanol plant reformer and engines. The 
total cost to install controls and electrify the engines at the methanol 
plant is estimated at $18.2 million.

Participation on ANSI Standard Setting Committee - Russell Tucker has been 
accepted as an Observer member on the Accredited Standards Committee for the 
Z10 Occupational Health and Safety Systems proposed ANSI standard. The 
completion of this ANSI standard will have an impact on all Enron companies 
in the US and territories, followed thereafter with impact to Enron 
international interest involved in ISO certifications. Russell Tucker will 
also serve on the API Z10 task force.

Ergonomics Software Program - Russ Tucker is coordinating an Enron pilot 
computer based training program on ergonomics.  the purpose is to grandfather 
Enron prior to passage of prescriptive OSHA regulations requiring such a 
training program for any employee who uses a computer for 50% of their work 
effort. However, everyone must not necessarily have used the software 
training program before the regulations pass. There are costs saving in 
becoming grandfathered, because of the flexibility of using the computer 
based training program in lieu of the prescriptive OSHA programs.

Caledonia Power Plant - The Mississippi Environmental Enforcement Division 
conducted an unannounced environmental inspection at the EES OEC power 
plant.  No significant issues were identified in the inspection.

EES Origination - Mike Terraso facilitated an introduction of EES Harold 
Buchanan and Michael Mann to General Motors Vice President of Environmental 
and Energy to initiate a energy outsourcing proposal.

Pipeline Safety Legislation- Jeff Keeler continues to lead the Enron effort 
in monitoring and influencing the Senate and House versions of potential 
pipeline safety legislation.  He is working closely with Stan Horton and 
David Johnson in GPG. The Senate version passed late on Thursday September 
7th.

Recent information indicates that the State of Michigan and possibly other 
state and industrial parties who have challenged the EPA's NOx SIP Call 
regulation in court -- and lost -- will file an appeal with the U.S. Supreme 
Court this September.

As you may recall, on June 22, the U.S. Court of Appeals, D.C. Circuit, 
upheld the EPA's NOx SIP Call regulations, lifted the stay on the 
regulations, and mandated that states move forward with developing and 
submitting State Implementation Plans (SIPs) by the end of October 2000.   

States that must now develop SIPs include:  Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, 
District of Columbia, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, 
Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, 
Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West 
Virginia, Wisconsin  (Georgia, Missouri & Wisconsin were excluded from the 
regulation by the Appeals Court in its original decision, but will eventually 
be re-included in the SIP process)

Impact of a Supreme Court Appeal:

Parties appealing the case to the Supreme Court will likely ask for a stay of 
the EPA requirement for states to submit SIPs until the case is finally 
decided.    It is not certain whether or not a stay would be granted by the 
Court.  An appeal can not be filed until the Court returns at the beginning 
of October, and a decision on a stay might not come until after the October 
30 SIP deadline, so it many states might proceed with developing their SIP 
anyway.   States who choose to not develop a SIP and assume that a stay will 
be granted will be taking the risk that they miss the October 30 SIP deadline 
and EPA imposes its own Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) -- if the stay is 
not granted, the state would have to live with the federal requirements for 
NOx reductions in its state.

Another impact is that the May 2003 deadline for implementation of the rule 
-- and compliance by emitting sources -- may also be delayed if the Supreme 
Court imposes a stay on the regulations and accepts the case on appeal.   If 
the case is accepted, a decision would not likely be reached until June 2001, 
which would likely delay a compliance deadline until 2004.

We will keep you posted as this situation develops.  Right now, Environmental 
Strategies is continuing to work in the states that are developing SIPs, to 
ensure that the states treat new generation fairly and that market-based 
solutions to NOx reduction are employed so that trading and other 
opportunities for Enron businesses will be maximized.

ADVOCACY

Pipeline Safety Legislation  - While there is still a slim chance that the=

Transredes Oil Spills
 Oruru- the Bolivian Superintendence of Hydrocarbons fined Transredes 
$114,000 for failing to conduct proper maintenance to the OSSA-2 pipeline 
resulting in 
the January 30,2000 oil release. 
The  Parotani and Chorety river oil spills have been cleaned up.  At Chorety 
the river was open to normal use.  Drinking water is no longer being 
delivered to the 
communities since the river water has passed drinking water quality 
analytical tests.  Bolivian regulatory agency visited the Parotani site and 
found additional 
contamination.  A crew was sent to clean up the newly found contamination.  
Transredes at the request of the Bolivian Forestry Department planted 350 
trees in
 this area. 

Houston Non-Attainment Study - Marc Phillips is putting together information 
on the economic impact of the proposed Houston non-attainment regulations on 
the Enron methanol plant for the Business Coalition for Clean Air (BCCA) 
economic study. The information will be submitted to the BCCA consultant by 
mid-September. The reciprocating engines and reformer at the methanol plant 
will be required to be controlled in 2003 and 2004.


List of International Environmental Emergency Responders  D Ronkanein 
conducted a telephone and  internet search.    Most responders identified
were USA based. This list will be reviewed with other Enron entities for 
final selection to enter into a service agreements with qualified emergency 
response
companies. 

Transredes  EHS Organization - Henry Van and Greg Marino met with Peter 
Weidler to discuss approaches for assessing the EHS management system 
for Transredes. 


ENA - Honey Lake (California) Power Facility- an employee was burned in a 
flash fire ,presumably caused by wood chip dust ignited by a electric spark, 
while monitoring the hopper loading operation.  Scott Watson is assisting 
plant management in the investigation and with CalOSHA visits to the facility.

Lagos Emergency Power Plant - the environmental impact assessment  (EIA) 
process begins in 2 weeks. A waiver from Nigeria was granted to begin 
work on power barges now - while EIA is under development.  Expect EIA 
completion this fall. Nine  barges are being refurbished one at a time on 
site and 
will be put into service as the refurbishing is completed.  Water injection 
is required to reduce NOx to conform to World Bank standards.  The water 
treatment 
plant will completed by about the time that the 7th barge is place into 
service.  Then the 8th and 9th and the already operating barges will receive 
water injection.
  As a result of negotiations with Nigeria the barges will use natural gas to 
fuel the generators at a  new site immediately adjacent to an existing power 
plant.  

Metgas Pipeline - Joe Kolb reviewed and provided comments to Paul Perisho on 
the draft environmental management  plan (EMP 

ENEL, Nicaragua -  Mike Fuentes completed the site visits for the 
environmental due diligence this week.  An executive summary and preliminary 
cost estimate is expected early next week.

Annual Report - The mark up draft is ready for review. Photos were not 
acceptable and waiting for Ken Lay signature the chairman statement. A  photo 
session for internal, operations and field  EHS subjects scheduled for 
Tuesday.  The web version of the report (without recently added photos) will 
be ready for intranet posting by mid week. When the additional photos have 
been inserted, a new report will be posted.

Re: Voluntary Approaches to Climate Change - Action in Congress & the=20
Administration

Date:   April 30, 2001

In the current debate over how the U.S. should approach domestic and=20
international climate change issues, focus has increased lately on explorin=
g=20
=01&voluntary=018 approaches to reduce greenhouse gases.  President Bush=01=
,s=20
statements that the U.S. would not impose mandatory CO2 reductions on power=
=20
plants as part of a multipollutant bill and his position that the U.S. shou=
ld=20
not move forward with work on the Kyoto Protocol (which contains actual=20
commitments on emission reductions) have driven the discussion about=20
voluntary programs and whether such programs can achieve significant result=
s.

Two articles (attached) appeared in the Washington Post over the weekend. =
=20
The first, reported on an interview with Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle=
=20
(D-S.D.) where he said that he and other Democrats would be open to new=20
approaches to address climate change, including voluntary compliance with=
=20
greenhouse gas emission reduction goals.  In response to strong criticism b=
y=20
environmentalists, a second article appeared on Sunday that backs away from=
=20
those remarks and re-states his support for =01&binding measures=018 to red=
uce=20
greenhouse gas emissions.  =20

Both the Bush Administration and leaders on Capitol Hill are seeking Enron=
=01,s=20
input on the structure and potential effectiveness of voluntary programs.  =
=20
As the Administration=01,s Climate Change Task Force is preparing its=20
recommendations for a new U.S. proposal, our input is needed in the next fe=
w=20
weeks.
Experience with Voluntary Approaches - Back to the Future?
The U.S. and other developed nations have acknowledged that significantly=
=20
reducing greenhouse gas emissions will be extremely difficult through=20
voluntary measures alone.  It is not yet known whether the Bush=20
Administration will propose a climate change plan that will result in lower=
=20
atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases.  However, it is unlikely th=
at=20
a U.S. proposal that calls for only voluntary measures will carry any=20
credibility in the international debate. =20
Clearly, industry opponents to carbon regulation do not seek a strong=20
program, but as recent weeks suggest, Administration officials have differi=
ng=20
views on objectives and approaches.    Below are some recent examples of wh=
y=20
voluntary plans in the past have not provided the desired results:
1) Under the Framework Convention on Climate Change, signed by former=20
President Bush and subsequently ratified by the U.S. Senate, developed=20
countries voluntarily agreed to return their greenhouse gas emissions to 19=
90=20
levels by the year 2000.  By 1995, industrialized countries acknowledged th=
at=20
they were not on track to meet the voluntary goal, and initiated negotiatio=
ns=20
to adopt binding and quantifiable emissions reduction commitments.  These=
=20
negotiations resulted in the Kyoto Protocol=01,s targets and timetables, wh=
ere=20
industrialized nations committed to reduce their aggregate emissions to abo=
ut=20
5 percent below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012 and the U.S. agreed to a=
=20
reduction of 7 percent below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012.=20

2) On the domestic level, the 1992 Energy Policy Act directed DOE to develo=
p=20
a voluntary reporting program to collect information on activities to reduc=
e=20
greenhouse gas emissions.  The aim of the =01&1605b=018 program is to encou=
rage=20
voluntary emissions reductions.  While some companies participate in the=20
program, it has not yielded significant emissions reductions.  Companies=20
participate mostly to receive positive pubic relations benefits and to gain=
=20
experience with inventories, reporting and verification.  Many hope to be=
=20
rewarded with credits for their voluntary action under a potential mandator=
y=20
program.  To encourage participation, 1605b provides wide flexibility on=20
setting a baseline.  It also allows for dual reporting of emissions=20
reductions, self-certification of reductions and permits the entity to deci=
de=20
the level of reporting it undertakes.

A 1998 GAO study said that EIA and other organizations agreed that many of=
=20
the reductions reported under the voluntary reporting program would not=20
qualify as =01&real, appropriately reviewed and verified=018 emissions redu=
ctions. =20
Congress has been considering how to strengthen the 1605b program for sever=
al=20
years and will likely include provisions to do so in new climate change pla=
ns.

3) Chafee/Lieberman =01&Credit for Early Action=018 legislation:  In the 10=
6th=20
Congress, the debate centered around proposals to help U.S. businesses=20
achieve =01&credit=018 for voluntary actions to reduce greenhouse gases.  T=
he=20
legislation never progressed, however, due to the difficulty in structuring=
 a=20
voluntary program.  Concerns about granting credit against not-yet-created=
=20
regulatory regimes, difficulty with setting baselines for determining which=
=20
voluntary actions warrant credit, and political problems with links to=20

Opportunities for Enron

Through our ongoing advocacy on domestic multipollutant strategies and our=
=20
role as a respected source for information on how to structure market-based=
=20
systems for emissions reductions, Enron is well situated to provide=20
high-level input to the Administration and Congress toward developing=20
credible energy and climate change proposals.  In particular, we have a rea=
l=20
opportunity to promote ideas that benefit Enron businesses - new generation=
,=20
gas, energy efficiency, emissions trading and risk management - while handi=
ng=20
the White House some ways to restore its credibility on climate issues.

Enron=01,s input should continue to focus on mechanisms that will result in=
 real=20
reductions of greenhouse gas emissions, while providing full flexibility fo=
r=20
companies and others to meet clear goals.  We have already indicated to the=
=20
Administration and others in initial discussions that voluntary measures=20
could fit into a comprehensive package, but will likely fall short of=20
environmental and international expectations. =20

The Senate will be conducting several hearings in the coming weeks, and the=
=20
White House=01,s Task Force will continue to meet and prepare its climate c=
hange=20
proposal.  Jeff and I will develop specific recommendations for the White=
=20
House and Congress and circulate them with you and relevant Enron commercia=
l=20
groups.  We will also incorporate discussion of these issues in an Enron-wi=
de=20
strategy meeting on emissions issues we are planning in May.

EUROPE

Poland, ENS Power Plant - Alan Stringer conducted EHS gap analysis audit of the facility and made recommendations on additional procedures required to meet Enron Guidelines and provided advice on EHS aspects for exit strategy of the site.

UK, Project McCook - Alan Stringer participated in a conference call with Susan Worthen, Don Stevens, and Robert Brooks to discuss environmental issues related to indemnification.  This deal is estimated to be signed next week..  Susan's Team will need to conduct a due diligence within 60 days. 


Japan, Brownfield Site  - Alan Stringer provided technical assistance and requested historical information on potential brownfield site that EEOS are considering in Japan. 

UK, EPOL - TPS -    Alan Stringer and Henry Van are preparing the final list of EHS issues from the O&M audit to be presented to Mike Terraso for resolution. 

ENRON GLOBAL ASSETS
(Central America, South America, India and Asia)

San Juan Gas Remediation - field evidence indicates that the tar has migrated off-site to the neighbor's property. 

ENA
 
N. York, Edison Mission Brooklyn Navy Yard Facility - Bill Curra completed the environmental due diligence evaluation of the Edison Mission cogeneration plant for NE Power Origination.  Indications are favorable that the acquisition will go forward, and further risk management assistance relating to environmental issues will be required. 

ACQUISITIONS
 
Sithe Independent Power Partners - 1000 MW combined cycle natural gas fired cogeneration facility located in the Town of Scriba, County of Oswego, NY.  ECT is interested in entering into a 40% limited partnership with no O&M responsibility.  Don Stevens has learned that ECT has submitted their bid to Sithe and is awaiting a response.

GREENFIELD CAPITAL PROJECTS

Offshore LNG Vaporization Terminal - California - Gus Eghneim (Enron Corp) has been asked to manage environmental permitting for an offshore LNG vaporization terminal in California.  Gus has agreed to keep Joe Kolb informed and involved at the next meeting.  The project is in the very early stages of consideration.

DEPARTMENT PROJECTS

Social Responsibility Risk Assessment Tool - Gavin Dillingham met with Lauren Iannarone and they decided to add some more functionality to the database. They will add a section for case studies, transaction cost and industry type. Once this is done it will be populated and the prototype will be demonstrated to interested Enron business units.

REGULATORY TECHNICAL ANALYSIS

Enron IT Employee Receives Ergonomics Relieve - Russell Tucker located a workstation solution to allow the raising of the desk top in selectable increments to provide back strain relieve to an Enron IT employee that is 6' 8" tall.

COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE & BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES

California Power Development -- NEPA Review -  Jeff Keeler and Mary Schoen held a meeting with EWS/ENA West power developers to discuss a proposed project in Roseville, CA.   Since the project must connect to the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) through a substation, WAPA is suggesting that it may need to perform not only a NEPA analysis from the Enron project to the substation, but on the entire WAPA grid, due to NEPA's mandate to analyze "all downstream impact."   Jeff and Mary are working on strategies to determine:  1) if it is legally feasible to conduct NEPA review just for the Enron project portion so that Cal. Energy Commission process is not delayed and 2)  if agencies involved in NEPA review will comply with Bush executive orders mandating expedited review of power project permit applications.

Emissions Control Technology -- Clean Coal Funding - Jeff Keeler discussed with EGM a preliminary strategy for pursuing DOE clean coal program funding for a demonstration project or commercialization grant for the Clean Solutions Group's "NOx Tech" pollution control technology.

Voluntary Greenhouse Gas Emissions Target Analysis -   Lisa Jacobson and Susan Worthen offered recommendations and analysis on voluntary greenhouse gas emissions commitments to Mike Terraso.  Lisa continued to identify opportunities and business activity related to greenhouse gas emissions issues (Climate Neutral Network conference, GEMI conference).

Global Climate Change -  Lisa Jacobson continued to provide intelligence to business units and corporate groups on climate change policy developments, including:
Canada's negotiations with the EU and announcement that it may work to support the Kyoto protocol
Japan's discussions with the US and EU, and resulting announcement that Japan will not move forward with any climate change agreement without the US.
Delay in release of EU climate change policies (coordinated with Govt. Affairs, Brussels/London)
US congressional activity on climate change

Sterling Energy/Renewable Desk - Stacey Bolton followed up w/CEO and COO from Sterling Planet regarding the renewable desk potentially supplying them green tags. Organized call between Sterling and ENA West for next week to explore business opportunities.   Stacey is working with Sarah Novosel (Reg Affairs, Washington) to detail Enron's position before FERC regarding intermittency.  Elliot Mainzer is speaking at a FERC hearing in July, and coordinating position w/ Sarah.

ADVOCACY & COMMERCIAL SUPPORT

Multipollutant & New Source Review Strategies - Jeff Keeler and representatives of the power generation industry met with EPA concerning its 90-day review of the NSR program and its proposed recommendations to the White House.   The group briefed EPA staff from the Administrator's office, Office of Air and Radiation, NSR Enforcement office and White House Council of Economic Advisors on NSR concerns for new power development and our proposed multipollutant solutions that could offer and alternative to NSR.

Global Climate Change - Lisa  Jacobosn and Jeff Keeler continued work on a number of initiatives with commercial and corporate groups:
Congressional advocacy - Lisa represented Enron at a Climate Change lobby day sponsored by several environmental groups. Enron was the only company to make a formal presentation on its position on global climate change.  About 100 delegates were present, representing the scientific, religious, business and environmental communities from Washington, New Mexico, Ohio, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Maine, New Hampshire, Michigan, and Maryland.

Re: White House Climate Change Task Force

Date:   April 16, 2001


Per your request, here is some preliminary information on the=20
Administration's climate change task force.  First, there is a White House=
=20
climate change task force and it has met at least twice already.  It is=20
coordinated by the Domestic Policy Council and the National Economic=20
Council.  Emphasis during the first meetings has been on procedure, educati=
on=20
and review of the key issues.

The task force facilitates the Administration=01,s ongoing "cabinet level=
=20
review" on climate change policy.  They are aiming for as high a level of=
=20
participation as possible, but acting and deputy assistant secretaries have=
=20
also been attending.  White House staff is being very tight-lipped about th=
e=20
task force discussions due to political sensitivities and fears of media=20
leaks. =20
=20
The task force will solicit input from outside stakeholders (scientists,=20
industry and environmental groups), but as I understand it, participation o=
n=20
the task force is limited to government officials. =20

The task force is set to meet frequently - possibly weekly - over the next=
=20
six weeks.  I have heard different descriptions of its objectives.  Some ha=
ve=20
said its goal is to develop broad principles, procedures and a strategy in=
=20
preparation for the resumed international negotiations in Bonn, Germany thi=
s=20
July (COP-6 II).  Others suggest that the White House intends to release a=
=20
specific proposal on climate change, with domestic and international=20
components, as early as next month. =20

On the domestic front, Enron has been providing input to the Administration=
=20
on our creative ideas for a multi-pollutant air emissions strategy for the=
=20
power generation sector.  We have been invited to provide input on=20
international proposals, with a preferred timeline of this week.

At this stage, each task force meeting is dedicated to covering a different=
=20
topic (i.e., science, economic impacts, role of technology, etc.).  The=20
meetings tend to have an educational angle, as many participants are not=20
familiar with these specific and technical issues.  The task force has like=

not yet delved into analysis of the market-based mechanisms (emissions=20
trading or project-based options to reduce greenhouse gas emissions) or oth=

issues related to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate=20
Change/Kyoto Protocol negotiations.

Enron has an excellent relationship with John Howard, the task force=20
coordinator from the Domestic Policy Council.  Jeff and I plan to meet with=
=20
Bob McNally, the National Economic Council coordinator, tomorrow.=20

Jeff and I also would like to talk with you about strategy and=20
recommendations for the White House on international proposals.  It would b=
e=20
valuable for Enron to weigh in supporting:

? Action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions even in the absence of scientif=

treaty to reduce greenhouse gas emissions - however, developed countries=20
should be encouraged to take action now and work towards solutions

These bullets are consistent with Enron=01,s current position statement. =

Attached are draft Q&A on Enron's response to the Greenpeace letter on 
climate change.   This document should be for close distribution to those of 
us in Enron Corp and Enron Europe who could potentially get questions on our 
response.  More general taking points for use by employees will be developed 
for distribution to a wider internal audience.

I would suggest that any detailed questions be referred to me so that we are 
able to closely control the messages consistent with our Corporate 
statement/strategy on climate.  If questions specific to Enron Europe come 
up, they should be referred to PR (Jackie/Kate) in London or Peter Styles in 
Brussels, who will coordinate closely with me.

Please review this document and make suggested changes and additions as soon 
as possible, as the letter has already been sent to Greenpeace (signed by 
Kelly and Mike on 4/30).

Thanks!

Rob,
After reviewing both Lauren's and Jeff's comments, I have little to add.  I 
would, however, replace the last part of Jeff's sentence in the first 
paragraph with "and there is a need to take a comprehensive look at 
strategies for reducing CO2  emissions more broadly, in ways that make 
economic and environmental sense" to avoid mentioning the Kyoto Protocol 
directly.
And, I'd like to reiterate Lauren's suggestion that the article should direct 
employees to our climate change policy statement in last year's EHS Report 
and that Lay encourages them to research and reflect on the issue and 
communicate their thoughts.
Thanks,
Catherine

		 Subject: Ken Lay Statement to Employees on Bush CO2 Policy


(KEELER EDITS)
Here is my draft for Ken in response to Ann's eBiz request.  Comments welcome


"The President, after a good deal of study and soul searching, decided not to 
support mandatory controls on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from power 
plants as part of a multipollutant clean air strategy.   His decision was 
based on some very important factors -- the nation's energy markets are 
experiencing unprecedented supply and price challenges that any CO2 mandate 
could exacerbate; and U.S. regulation of CO2 in the near-term could be 
ill-advised because the Kyoto protocol on global treatment of greenhouse gas 
emissions is unworkable in its current form.  

"I was somewhat concerned that the message sent by the Bush administration 
would polarize the debate over how the U.S. should treat CO2 emissions in the 
long term, as his statement did provoke a very negative "anti-environment" 
reaction by many concerned individuals and organizations.  Because this is an 
important issue to all parties on all sides of the debate, I believe that the 
administration should convene an ongoing process to carefully examine global 
climate change and all the long-term economic, scientific, and social impacts 
of action regulate CO2 emissions."

"The President's position on CO2 notwithstanding, Enron continue to be a 
private sector leader in offering real solutions towards reducing greenhouse 
gas emissions in a rapidly expanding energy market.  We are well-positioned 
through our experience with low-carbon fuels for electric generation (natural 
gas and wind in particular), our focus on new power generation and 
tecnologies, our leadership position in promoting efficiency through Enron 
Energy Services' energy outsourcing business, and our expertise in emissions 
trading and risk management."

"A multipollutant appraoch to reducing power plant emissions makes a lot of 
sense from and environmental and energy policy standpoint.  Enron will 
continue to work with the Bush administration and Congress toward structuring 
a program that can achieve environmental goals while providing incentives to 
build cleaner, more efficient generation, promoting a broad mix of fuels and 
tecnologies, and giving industry the flexibility and economic incentives to 
make reductions in a market-based, cost-effective way.  If we're able to make 
meaningful reductions in 3 pollutants -- NOx, SO2 and mercury -- and we do it 
in a way that promotes efficiency and new technology, we'll make progress on 
CO2 whether it is regulated or not."

In the meantime, I will remain active in the global climate change debate to 
position Enron as a constructive player in the public policy arena and as an 
industry leader in promoting market-driven solutions to the world's energy 
and environmental problems.

Hi Mr. Lay,

I am a Specialist in Corp. PR, under Karen Denne, and write for our internal 
eBiz publication.  I am working on a story about the recent issue with 
respect to carbon dioxide emissions and Enron's position compared to 
President Bush's as well as the coal industry.  

I know that Bush's viewpoint on this issue is not to regulate carbon dioxide 
emissions from coal-burning power plants. I also understand he based his 
decision in large part due to a recent Department of Energy report that warns 
that such a policy would lead to an even more dramatic shift from coal to 
natural gas for electric power generation and significantly higher 
electricity prices causing problems similar to California.   

I wondered if you would mind adding first hand knowledge for employees.  A 
quote from you about this issue would be great.  I would also be interested 
in giving employees some of your reasons for being in favor of controlling 
CO2 such as your idea for a credit trading system for CO2.

Thank you for your time and please let me know if you have any questions.  

Thanks,
 Ann Schmidt

Dear Steve,

Thanks for stopping by last week's Emissions Strategy Meeting.  As you 
requested, I have attached the presentations from the meeting, as well as an 
agenda and participant list.  

The forum was well received by participants -- many found the policy updates 
and information exchange elements very useful.  Several commercial groups 
expressed interest in continuing to discuss and share information on NOx, SO2 
and carbon/greenhouse gas markets as they evolve.  

We also spent considerable time discussing U.S. "multipollutant" regulatory 
strategies, and received good commercial feedback on the proposals we have 
been circulating in Washington.  From our perspective, the meeting was a 
success from a strategic standpoint, giving our group the needed commercial 
feedback to proceed with advocacy strategies and deliver information that is 
most useful to their businesses.

Key Outcomes:

? Participants from commercial groups -- EES, EGMs, ENA, and Enron Europe -- 
expressed interest in competitive intelligence and policy updates on 
emissions issues.

? Commercial groups asked that Environmental Strategies, perhaps quarterly, 
bring a group together to be briefed on the policy landscape and 
environmental drivers for Enron markets.  (Not likely to be a large meeting, 
but a conference call) 

? Development of a list-serve or intranet site was suggested to facilitate 
communication among the participants.  We are already working on a intranet 
site for delivery of information/intelligence, but will work to add elements 
where commercial groups can share information about business ideas or 
possible deals.

Please see the attached participant list, agenda and presentations for more 
information.  Feel free to call me or Jeff if you have any questions.

Steve:  

Attached is a memo I have prepared on Chris Hessler, whose name has been 
submitted to the White House by Gov. Whitman as candidate for AA for Air and 
Radiation at EPA.

I believe Enron should weigh in to the White House fairly soon in support of 
Whitman's decision to appoint Hessler to AA for Air.  

Linda Robertson has reviewed the memo.  Her only concern is that we be 
careful in our approach to backing this candidate when Senator Jim Inhofe 
(R-OK) is pushing for another candidate. Linda suggests that we discuss 
strategy on this in DC on Tuesday, when you and I are both in town.   I have 
no problem waiting until Tuesday, but seem to remember that Ken Lay may be 
leaving town and we may need to get talking points in his hands sooner -- I 
await your guidance on this.

Information on the EPA Region IX candidate coming soon -- still waiting to 
interview the guy with Dave Parquet/Sam Wehn, who I want to ask some tough 
questions about some of the problematic energy/air issues in CA.

Thanks,

Jeff

In view of yesterday's events here in Washington and in New York, I know
that matters like this seem small, Steve.  But in the event you needed a
letter to pursue the question of Enron support for RFF, the attached
documents provide a formal letter request ("Enron01-campaign"), a list
of the energy and climate initiatives we're pursuing ("Enron-RFF
Initiatives) and a recounting of our visibility in the policy process
(self-explanatory).

What I'd like to say that isn't in the letter request is this:  in the
same way that you at Enron are trying to change the world by being a
better energy company than anyone imagined a company could be, we at RFF
are trying to improve the public policy process in a way that no one
ever imagined a think tank could do.  That may sound grandiose, but
you've shown that if you don't aim high, you don't accomplish very much.

Thanks, Steve.

Ecoelectrica - The meeting with the USEPA occurred on Tuesday August 1, 2000 
in San Juan, Puerto Rico.  Marc Phillips participated and reported that the 
meeting was non adversarial and the overall opinion of the Ecoelectrica 
participants was that it went well.  EPA stated that it was apparent that 
Ecoelectrica had put forth a significant effort in responding to the 
compliance notice.  Ecoelectrica promised to send additional requested 
information to clarify some of the issues identified at the meeting.  EPA 
will review the information presented at the meeting and follow-up with 
Ecoelectrica. There is still a potential for a penalty.

Enron Building Safety - in response to an employee request regarding work 
area safety, Scott Watson reviewed the 12th floor and developed a series of 
recommendations regarding reconstruction activities.  Scott will work with 
Henry Terech to review other areas for similar issues.  Henry has been very 
receptive to the to the safety support.

 Lagos Emergency Power Plant (9 barges - Nigeria) - Joe Kolb reviewed 
proposal by ERM to gather baseline information and write environmental impact 
assessment (EIA ) and provided comments to Robert Missen.  Also, alerted 
Lauren Goldblatt to project.

Best Management Practices - Joe Kolb completed discussions with consultant on 
proposed revisions to pipeline construction environmental BMPs.  Discussed 
strategy for obtaining "buy in" from key people within Enron.    Also, left 
message with Alex de Alarez explaining project as it relates to fiber optic 
cables and seeking a meeting.  Consultant is now beginning work on the 
electric and fiber optic portions.

Cuiaba II - Joe Kolb participated in conference call.  Public hearing on 
Monday went very well.  They had given presentations to several concerned 
groups/agencies prior to the hearing and, as a result, few people showed up 
and there were no controversy or accusatory questions.  Also, folks from the 
Rio Gen project were there to observe as they prepare for public 
consultation/hearing.


Annual Report - Susan Worthen is making minor modifications to the report to 
ensure as much information regarding emission reductions, etc. are properly 
conveyed.  Graphics were selected for feature and The Image Center is working 
to  gather the images and photos for the final layout.  The final draft is 
expected to be available for review by mid to end of next week. 

Greenhouse Gas Inventory - Susan Worthen attended a workshop sponsored by the 
Pew Center to discusss various strategies and lessons learned by other 
companies.  Working with Mary Schoen to identify EPA contact for a demo of 
the Climate Wise software, which Sunoco highly recommended as did another 
company previously did.  A.D. Little was  hired to review the Enron 
greenhouse gas estimates  and verify them as being calculated accurately 
prior to potential public communication. They have identified systematic 
mathematical and formula (methodology) errors in our international 
inventory.  Ramiro Garcia (Enron contract environmentalist) is assisting with 
the revision.  ADL will present their findings to us next week.  

ENEL, Nicaragua - Mike Fuentes is performing the environmental due 
diligence.  Don Stevens will perform the cost estimate.

Agreement was reached on Monday, July 23 on several key political issues related to the Kyoto Protocol.   Delegates at the Bonn climate change negotiations are expected to work through Saturday to develop additional decisions that will "incorporate and give full effect" to the agreement.  It is likely that adoption of some (or all) of these decisions will be pushed to the next set of negotiations in Morocco this fall.

Despite the media attention, there is a long and complex road ahead to a ratified treaty.  The major outcome of Bonn is that the road is still being traveled.  The agreement only covered a subset of key political issues.  Further, developed countries want the U.S. on board and this leaves room for the Bush Administration to offer an alternative -- though the window of opportunity could close shortly.  Please see links to several editorials below.

Impact on Enron
Even though the U.S. did not adopt this agreement and the Bush Administration will not support the Kyoto Protocol, its impact on Enron as well as other multinationals is unclear. The Kyoto Protocol negotiations have been driven by governments and impose mandatory emissions reduction targets on developed country governments that are Parties to the Protocol.  However, industry will have a role in complying with emissions reduction obligations. 

While the European Union has promoted "harmonized policies and measures" throughout this process, the Protocol leaves decisions on implementation of treaty obligations to domestic governments (that are Parties to the agreement).  Presently, U.S. companies with operations in countries that are Parties to the Protocol -- and have obligations under the Protocol  -- could face different standards, new greenhouse gas emissions regulations, domestic carbon taxes, among other options.  It is too early to tell how these issues will impact competitiveness or whether they will be interpreted as non-tariff trade barriers.   

Further, only Parties to the Protocol can utilize the market-based mechanisms under the Protocol (emissions trading, and project-mechanisms in developing countries through the Clean Development Mechanism, and project based mechanisms in other developed countries through Joint Implementation). Because the details are not yet worked out, it is unclear whether Enron would be able to participate in mechanisms or trading through offices in other countries outside the U.S.  It will be important that the U.S. develop linkages with the market-based mechanisms to enhance a global market for greenhouse gas emissions credits and lower compliance costs for firms with obligations. 

The agreement also increased the amount of carbon sinks that can be counted toward meeting a Party's emission reduction target in the first budget period (2008-2012).  The U.S. was set aside 28 million Mt C/yr in the event that it joins in at a later date.  Increased carbon accounting has the effect of lowering the burden of the emissions reduction target in the first budget period.  Of note, at the last set of negotiations in The Hague last November, the U.S. was close to receiving over 60 Mt C/yr.  This could contribute to more costly and burdensome reductions in the future for U.S. firms (as the U.S. could have a more stringent target to meet).

Key Provisions of the Political Agreement

Please see a summary of major elements of the Bonn agreement below.  I have also included a detailed summary provided by the Pew Center on Global Climate Change.

MARKET BASED MECHANISMS

Emissions Trading
No quantitative limits on the use of the market-based mechanisms (emissions trading, CDM or JI).  The EU retreated on this point.
No levy imposed on transactions.  Developing countries had championed levies as a source of financial assistance.
Seller liability would apply to transactions, with a commitment period reserve of either 90% of a Parties total budget (more attractive for net buyers) or the equivalent of five times its last national inventory (more attractive for net sellers).  This allows Russia to sell its "hot air" credits.

Clean Development Mechanism and JI
Nuclear power projects are not permitted under the CDM or JI
Afforestation and reforestation are the only eligible sequestration projects under the CDM
Small project "fast track" window in the CDM for renewable energy projects <15 MW, for efficiency and other projects equivalent to less than 15 GWh per year, and for new emitting projects that reduce emissions and with emissions of less than 15,000 tons per year.

COMPLIANCE

If parties are found in non-compliance, their compliance amount for the second commitment period is increased, they must formulate an action plan, and they are not permitted to participate in emissions trading.  This language is not legally binding, but political pressure to enforce the treaty obligations was likely to be the biggest driver for now.  The legally binding nature of the compliance regime will be revisited at the first meeting of the Parties to the Protocol (this would occur when and if it enters in to force).

shift which serves as a strong indicator that Congress will face new

FORD PREDICTS END OF CAR POLLUTION
The Independent (UK)
6 October 2000

Internet:
http://www.independent.co.uk/news/UK/Environment/2000-10/ford061000.shtml

The 100-year reign of the polluting internal combustion engine is coming to
an end, Bill Ford, chairman of the Ford Motor Company, said yesterday. It
will soon be replaced in motor vehicles by the hydrogen fuel cell, which
emits no pollution whatsoever and so can reduce the build-up of greenhouse
gases causing climate change, Mr. Ford, great-grandson of the company's
founder, Henry Ford, told the Greenpeace Business Conference in London.

In a remarkable speech from a motor manufacturer, in which he proclaimed
his
own environmental credentials, Mr. Ford, 43, accepted that the automobile
had
had a serious negative impact on the environment, and that his industry had
wrongly played down the threat from global warming.  And the head of the
world's second biggest car company raised eyebrows even further when he
said
that he could foresee the day when people would not want to own cars, but
merely have access to mobility.

Detroit-born Mr. Ford, who has been chairman since the start of last year,
proclaimed that climate change was the most challenging issue facing the
world and that anyone who disagreed was "in denial". Ford itself had moved
on
from that position, he said. But he felt the Kyoto protocol, the 1997 pact
in
which the industrialised nations agreed to try to limit their emission of
greenhouse gases, would not provide deep enough cuts to halt global
warming.
Only the marketplace, making new technology widely available, could tackle
the problem.

A fuel cell creates energy by an electrochemical process similar to that in
a
battery: it lets hydrogen and oxygen react together to produce electricity
and water vapour. It does not run down or need recharging, working as long
as
the hydrogen fuel is available, but most importantly, it does not produce
any
CO2, the basic by-product of any carbon-based fuel such as oil, gas or
coal.
Every major car company in the world is throwing huge sums into developing
the technology: Ford is spending $1bn (?690m) between now and 2004, while
Daimler-Chrysler, regarded as the leader in the field, has spent $700m. All
the main manufacturers have prototype fuel-cell cars running and there is a
race to bring them to market. Honda and Toyota expect to do so in 2003,
while
Ford and Daimler-Chrysler are aiming at 2004.

"I believe fuel cells will finally end the 100-year reign of the internal
combustion engine," Mr. Ford said, adding that the technology was "the holy
grail" of the motor industry. Prophesying the demise of car ownership, he
said:  "The day will come when the whole notion of car ownership is
antiquated," he said. Mr. Ford was reflecting advanced motor industry
thinking, which suggests many people might not want to pay for a car of
their
own if they could be guaranteed mobility on demand from a local hire
network.

Secretary of State Colin Powell and EPA Administrator Christine Whitman spoke separately to reporters yesterday and responded to questions on the agreement reached in Bonn and U.S. climate change policy.  

Of note from Powell:

President Bush takes global climate change "very, very seriously"
Agreement in Bonn is not acceptable to U.S.
Bush Administration hopes to release its climate change plan by next set of international climate change meetings (Oct. 2001, Morocco) or at future sessions

Of note from Whitman:

Whitman supports the recognition of carbon sinks included in the Bonn agreement
The White House climate change task force will meet again in August to develop plan

Please also see some reactions from Capitol Hill.  The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee held a hearing yesterday on climate change.  There are some interesting quotes from members in the stories below, but mostly from the usual suspects.  We will have to wait to see if the agreement reached in Bonn will create more momentum for bipartisan action to address climate change this Congress.  Most feel that next Congress is more realistic.  

While the divide on policy options still exists (i.e. voluntary vs. mandatory CO2 reductions), there is wider support for better systems to report of greenhouse gas emissions reductions, increases in R&D, incentives for a broad range of clean energy technologies (clean coal, renewable, fuel cells) and carbon sequestration technologies and pilot programs.

Of note,

Senator Frank Murkowski criticized the Bonn agreement for excluding nuclear energy projects from the mechanisms
Senator Bingaman said that there is a "greater willingness to move ahead" and that Senators are becoming increasingly uncomfortable with the U.S. not having a climate change policy

Please let me know if you have any questions.

US not dodging global warming challenge - Powell 

JAPAN: July 25, 2001 

TOKYO - U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell yesterday defended America's record on environmental protection and said Washington was not denying its responsibilities by refusing to back the Kyoto pact on global warming. 

In talks with Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, Powell thanked Tokyo for its efforts to bridge the gap between the United States and the European Union on the 1997 Kyoto pact, but added that Washington could not support the accord as it stands. 
"We know that global warming is a challenge. The United States is not running away from that challenge," Powell told a news conference after meeting Koizumi. 
"The president is committed to working with all the nations of the world who are involved in this process, to find ways that we can join a consensus at some point in the future, but the Kyoto Protocol - even what came out at Bonn - still is not acceptable to the United States," Powell said. 
Four days of high-level negotiations in Bonn, Germany, ended this week with a broad package on how to implement the Kyoto accord to reduce greenhouse gas emissions after Tokyo won latitude on how to reach its targets. 
Tokyo's consent has been crucial to bringing the accord into force since U.S. President George W. Bush rejected in March the 1997 pact, saying it would hurt the economy of the world's biggest polluter. 
Loathe to alienate the United States or to put Japanese companies at a competitive disadvantage, Koizumi has sought to lure Washington back to the Kyoto accord even as he promises Japan is committed to seeing it take effect in 2002. 
BRIDGING THE GAP 
Koizumi reiterated that stance yesterday. 
"We are making efforts so that America, the European Union and Japan can achieve cooperation," he told reporters at his official residence. "Things are moving that way." 
A Japanese official said Koizumi told Powell he wanted Washington to participate in a "constructive way" in the future and that Japan was leaving the door open for U.S. cooperation. 
Powell told the news conference that the United States was committed to working toward some framework to address the global warming problem. 
"I told the prime minister that President Bush takes global climate change very, very seriously," he said. 
"We want to work with Japan and others toward a global framework that deals effectively with the problem of global warming," he said, adding that the United States was putting forward ideas on technological initiatives and reviews were under way. 
"We have our cabinet members deeply involved in this and hopefully we'll have new ideas that can be presented at COP7 (a follow-up meeting of environment ministers in Morocco in October) or at other future meetings," Powell added. 
Scientists warn that the greenhouse effect - caused by pollutant gases trapping heat in Earth's atmosphere - could cause average temperatures to increase by up to six degrees Celsius (11 degrees Fahrenheit) in the next 100 years, with devastating effects on the environment.

US EPA's Whitman likes part of global warming treaty 

USA: July 25, 2001 

WASHINGTON - The Bush administration's top environmental official said yesterday she was pleased the global climate accord reached this week in Germany without U.S. participation allows countries to use their forests and farmland to soak up carbon dioxide emissions. 

"We believe there's a lot we can do with that," said Christine Todd Whitman, who heads the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, referring to the pact's language that permits forests and farmland to be carbon-storing "sinks." 
The provision was included in a deal reached by 180 countries in Bonn, Germany this week requiring industrialized nations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by an average 5.2 percent below 1990 levels by 2012. 
Whitman, speaking to reporters on Capitol Hill, said the Bush administration is working on its own plan for cutting U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, and that using forests and farmland to achieve that goal would help. 
"That kind of recognition, the importance of (carbon) sinks, has real implications for farmers, for ranchers and for forestry (and) gives us the opportunity to work aggressively with a number of our interested parties," she said. 
Whitman said one of the concerns the Bush administration had with the original terms of the international treaty was that it did not give countries sufficient credit for their forest and farmland to offset emissions. "So that was something that held us back for any support of it," she said. 
The administration is still worried the revised treaty would hurt the U.S. economy by requiring deep reductions in American emissions, while at the same time not requiring developing nation's to make any major cuts. 
Whitman said the White House has not "set a date certain" for finishing its emissions-cutting plan, but top administration officials will meet in August on the issue after a two-month hiatus. 
"We are looking for things we can do to put into place voluntary efforts that are going to address these (global warming) issues," she said. "I just don't how quickly we'll come up with a proposal." 
Whitman rejected charges made by other countries that the Bush administration's position against signing the emissions-cutting treaty has isolated the United States. 
"We are going to continue to work with the rest of the world," she said. "We're not isolationist." 
Whitman was on Capitol Hill testifying at a Senate hearing in favor of legislation to make the EPA part of the president's cabinet. 
The United States is one of only about a dozen countries that doesn't have cabinet level or ministerial status for its top environmental agency. The other countries on the list include Libya, Yemen, Qatar, Peru and Uzbekistan. 
Whitman said elevating the EPA to the cabinet would make it easier to negotiate with her international counterparts. 
The Bush administration supports the idea, as do most members of Congress. A vote on the legislation is expected this autumn.

US senators slam Bush on Kyoto pact, others say pact flawed 

USA: July 25, 2001 

WASHINGTON - U.S. Senate Democrats told a senior Bush administration official yesterday that the president's rejection of the Kyoto world climate change pact was "deplorable," while at the same hearing a leading Republican said the Kyoto treaty itself was a sham. 

The two sides of the Kyoto debate surfaced at a Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing on what the United States could do to reduce ever-increasing emissions of greenhouse gases, notably the emissions of carbon dioxide. 
The United States is the biggest emitter of the gases, blamed for a gradual increase in temperature that many scientists say threatens to melt polar ice caps, raise ocean levels and cause radical changes in weather patterns. 
Skeptics - including some conservative Republicans - doubt the changes are attributable to man-made causes and think the drastic forecasts are alarmist. 
U.S. BECOMING MORE ISOLATED 
While the rest of the world celebrated this week's meetings in Bonn, Germany, that settled a compromise Kyoto treaty, the United States has become more isolated on the issue. It was the only major world power to pull out of the pact. 
The Kyoto treaty calls for industrialized states to trim output of greenhouse gases to an average of 5.2 percent below 1990 levels by 2012. The pact allows industrialized countries to trade emissions with less-developed ones to meet targets, and to use large areas of forests and farmland as carbon-storing "sinks" to offset emissions reduction goals. 
California Democrat Dianne Feinstein said the United States appeared "really backward" by removing itself from the global treaty. 
At the same time, Alaska Republican Frank Murkowski said the fact that Bonn negotiators rejected nuclear power as a resource to fight global warming showed the inadequacy of the treaty. 
Ignoring nuclear power "showed the weakness and fallacy of those basically responsible for the (Bonn) agenda)," said Murkowski, a longtime proponent of more drilling for oil and natural gas in his home state. 
President George W. Bush in March rejected the Kyoto process, saying the pact's mandated carbon dioxide emission cuts would harm the American economy while not restricting China and less-developed nations from spewing pollutants. 
Francis Blake, deputy secretary of the U.S. Energy Department, said Congress should focus its attention on funding new technologies to reduce carbon emissions. He deflected the Kyoto treaty criticisms from both sides as ultimately irrelevant. 
"Research and development opportunities are the single most effective role that Congress and the administration can play (at this time)," Blake told senators. 
He said "ideas on the drawing board" would alter forever the debate about emission reductions, noting programs in need of federal funding were focused on sequestering carbon dioxide before the gas reached the atmosphere and did any harm. 
Blake said the Bush agenda was mulling options to combat climate change and said a White House task force would issue its opinions on how to attack the problem. He did not say when the task force would make public its recommendations. 
US CARBON EMISSIONS GROWING 
Estimates used by Blake in his testimony showed the nation faces a real problem in reducing carbon emissions. 
"The Energy Information Administration is projecting that U.S. carbon dioxide emissions from energy consumption will reach 1800 million metric tons of carbon equivalent in 2010, and continue to rise to 2000 million metric tons by 2020, an average annual growth rate of 1.4 percent," Blake said. 
"We will need a concerted effort to reduce this trend." 
Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman, a New Mexico Democrat, said it was time to push on with new ideas for battling emissions, although he noted the Kyoto pact worked out in Bonn seemed to answer many of Bush's concerns. 
"Agreement was reached on rules for the Kyoto Protocol yesterday that include all of the flexibility mechanisms the U.S. government and U.S. industry had long argued were critical to a cost-effective strategy," Bingaman said. 
He said just last month his panel took testimony from experts that showed China had reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by as much as one-third over the past 20 years through increasing efficiency. 
More details for the global climate treaty will be hammered out at an October meeting of world environment ministers in Morocco.

Congress Moves to Follow on Kyoto
Environment: Lawmakers are caught off guard by other nations' decision to deal with problem of global warming without U.S. help. Effort to pass legislation to curb emissions is revived.
By ELIZABETH SHOGREN
Times Staff Writer

July 25 2001

WASHINGTON -- Congressional efforts to combat global warming received an unexpected boost from a decision this week by more than 180 countries to deal with the problem without the United States, outside experts and key lawmakers said Tuesday. 

They added that prospects now appear good that Congress will pass one or more measures designed to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide, which scientists say is the chief contributor to global warming. 

"The odds are improving that this Congress will deal with the issue before the [2002] election," said Rep. Sherwood L. Boehlert (R-N.Y.), a leading environmentalist in his party. 

Several House and Senate members said they were caught off guard when the other countries adopted rules Monday in Bonn to implement the Kyoto Protocol without U.S. participation. 

"Bonn surprised people," said Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.). "The feeling was that, if the United States took its football and left the field, the game couldn't go forward. But the rest of the nations of the world found their own football, and they completed the game. They left the United States on the sidelines." 

In meetings in Europe last week, President Bush cited congressional sentiment as having contributed to his decision to play no role in the development of rules to implement the 1997 accord reached in Kyoto, Japan. The accord called on industrial countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels. 

But sentiment in Congress has changed significantly since the Senate voted, 95 to 0, four years ago to direct the president not to sign a binding treaty to limit emissions unless developing countries were required to do the same. 

Bush, who has characterized the Kyoto accord as "fatally flawed," has promised to address the issue of global warming. But so far his proposals mainly have involved studying the problem and redirecting funds to underwrite new technologies to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. 

After meeting with his counterparts in Genoa, Italy, last week, Bush agreed to produce a U.S. strategy to combat climate change by the next meeting of Kyoto participants, scheduled for October. 

But on Capitol Hill, several efforts to address climate change already are in motion. 

Sen. James M. Jeffords (I-Vt.), in his new role as chairman of the Senate Environment Committee, is holding the first hearing Thursday on legislation that would regulate four pollutants emitted by power plants--including carbon dioxide, which scientists consider the major contributor to global warming. 

Bipartisan bills have been introduced in both houses to significantly tighten fuel-efficiency standards for sport-utility vehicles and light trucks, which would reduce carbon dioxide emissions. 

The GOP-controlled House also has altered its stance on climate change. Representatives have voted overwhelmingly to strip language from funding bills that would prohibit federal agencies from spending money to implement the Kyoto accord. 

Even two traditional climate-change skeptics--Sens. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.) and Ted Stevens (R-Alaska)--are co-sponsoring a bill that would direct the White House to create an office on climate change and to produce annual strategies to reduce carbon dioxide and other greenhouse emissions. Both senators represent states that are major producers of fossil fuels. 

"I think there's a greater willingness to go ahead," said Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.), chairman of the Senate Energy Committee. "I don't know for certain where the votes are. But I believe [senators] are less and less comfortable with the administration's apparent inability to form a policy. Some of that is about what's happening internationally, and some of that is what people are hearing from their constituents." 

They agreed that the United States' awkward--some say untenable--position on the sidelines of the Kyoto process is increasing the prospects for congressional action. 

"The events in Bonn will accelerate movements that have begun here over the last several months toward doing something to curb American greenhouse gas emissions," Lieberman said. "There has been a growing bipartisan movement to take action even while the Bush administration has been pulling away from the international process. It really has been fascinating." 

Eileen Claussen, who was assistant secretary of State with responsibility for climate change negotiations in the Clinton administration, said she was amazed by the shift in attitudes in the Senate. 

"Kyoto was such a dirty word from the end of 1997 until now," said Claussen, now president of the Pew Center of Global Climate Change. "You could barely go up to the Hill and say 'Kyoto' before. You might have been able to say 'climate change,' but any real interest in doing something about climate change was only from a very small minority." 

Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.), a leader on climate change policy in the Senate, said the agreement in Bonn improves the odds that Congress will proceed on climate change legislation, albeit in piecemeal fashion. 

"I think it increases the pressure--not necessarily to pass a facsimile of the treaty but to embrace individual initiatives that have an impact on emissions," Kerry said. "It will proceed in a step-by-step process." 

The combined effect of those steps, he said, "may be quite significant." 

Still, Kerry expressed skepticism that a comprehensive strategy could be passed without leadership from the White House. 

"You can legislate to a certain degree, but without an administration and the bully pulpit of the presidency, it's exceedingly difficult to embrace a larger scheme." 

Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said she considered it "deplorable and arrogant" that the administration turned its back on Kyoto, noting that the United States is responsible for about a quarter of the world's carbon dioxide emissions. 

"There's no question that climate change is the No. 1 environmental issue in the United States," she said. 

Feinstein said she believes that tightening fuel-efficiency standards for SUVs and light trucks is the most important thing that Congress can do in a "single stroke." Cars and trucks account for about a third of carbon dioxide emissions in this country. 

Jeffords expressed hope that at some point the United States will rejoin the international effort to fight global warming. In the meantime, he said, he will fight for passage of his bill to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, which are responsible for an additional third of U.S. emissions. 

"I am hopeful we can get it passed in the Senate," Jeffords said. "It's not going to be easy if the White House pulls out all the stops in opposition." 

Earlier this year, Bush reversed a campaign promise to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, then pulled out of the Kyoto accord. 

Preliminary government estimates show that carbon dioxide emissions, a major contributor to global warming, jumped nearly 3% in the United States last year while declining in other industrialized nations and China.

You are invited to a meeting next Thursday (3/22) afternoon at 2:00 to 
discuss energy commodity and renewable energy credits for the Enron Building, 
Center and Stadium.  There are a few efforts that are going on simultaneously 
and I thought it would be a good idea for all of us to meet and get on the 
same page.  As many of you might know, Enron Wind (Michael Payne) and ENA 
(Mike Curry) have a great proposal to retire renewable energy credits from 
our Enron Wind facility to match the consumption of the building and stadium 
(details attached below).  If this proposal goes forward, Enron would be the 
1st Fortune 500 company to "go green" in its headquarters building.  Couple 
this w/ our energy star award, and we have GREAT environmental messaging.   
We'd like to highlight this announcement on Earth Day (April 22nd).

The facilities folks are interested in switching from Reliant to EES for 
actual commodity.  It makes sense to work strategically together on win-win 
proposal that will not only make sense economically, but that we can use in 
our messaging.  The focus of the meeting is to discuss the various proposals, 
and steps for moving forward.   

The meeting will be in EB50MO3 from 2:00-3:00. Please let me know if you or 
someone from your group can attend.

s addressed to Enron Corp., we believe the EPA's focus should be on the EOT=
T pipeline system. We shared these and other thoughts with the agency when =
we met last week in Washington D.C. We hope to hear back from EPA soon rega=
rding clarification/resolution of several issues discussed during the meeti=
ng (e.g., whether a response solely from EOTT is sufficient at this time). =
=20

TIMING -- Enron Corp. received the information request on July 7, 2001. We =
requested and received a 90-day extension from the agency, thereby making o=
ur response due on November 7, 2001. The agency likely will require a consi=
derable amount of time to review our response because we will report a fair=
ly significant number of discharges/releases, which will be accompanied by =
a large number of responsive documents. It is unlikely that the agency will=
 begin a serious review of our response until sometime following the 2001 h=
oliday season. Based on our meeting in Washington, we do not expect a quick=
 response in 2002 because the Water Enforcement Division has an extremely b=
usy agenda and a small staff, which likely will preclude them from focusing=
 solely on our response. In addition, we know that the agency sent out a si=
milar information request to the Williams Companies. Thus, we do not expect=
 a response from EPA until late spring-mid summer of 2002 at the earliest.

PROCESS -- After we submit our response to the information request, EPA cou=
ld respond in several ways:

(1) The agency could request a meeting to discuss the materials submitted o=
n November 7, 2001 or send out another request seeking additional informati=
on. We will be prepared to respond to any such request. (This is a fairly l=
ikely scenario)

(2) Either before or after requesting additional information, EPA could iss=
ue a notice of violation and begin some type of administrative enforcement =
action. This could take the form of a compliance order and administrative c=
ivil penalty (all internal to the agency) or a consent decree with an order=
 entered by a federal court. An order could include a fine, required pipeli=
ne maintenance activities, and/or stipulated penalties for future discharge=
s or releases. Although the differences with our situation appear to be sig=
nificant, EPA recently settled an enforcement action with Koch Industries f=
or oil spills from its pipeline system for $30 million. Under an enforcemen=
t action, we would attempt to negotiate the terms of the order with the age=
ncy and hopefully minimize the size of any proposed fine. We also believe t=
hat our actions (principally those of ETS as operator of the EOTT pipeline =
system) between now and the time of the agency's response will be helpful i=
n attempting to mitigate any fine or course of action proposed by the agenc=
y. (This is also a fairly likely scenario)

(3) If our response is particularly troublesome to EPA, the agency could tu=
rn the matter over to the Department of Justice. Before this scenario would=
 unfold; however, the agency likely would conduct additional inquiries (e.g=
., more focused information requests and employee interviews). This scenari=
o would be most problematic because it likely would unfold only if the gove=
rnment (EPA and DOJ) consider the alleged violations extremely serious and =
possibly systematic. (Although possible, this is a less likely scenario)

If you have any additional questions, don't hesitate to contact me (3-7267)=

Utilities Optional CO2 Reductions Included in Plan By Energy Companies to Lower Emissions

A group of five energy companies is floating a proposal to cut power plant emissions, with an option for cutting carbon dioxide, while setting emissions limits that would begin almost immediately. The proposal by the Clean Power Group joins a multi-emissions proposal from another industry coalition, the Clean Energy Group, as well as several
proposals in Congress for power plant emissions reductions. In addition, the Bush administration is set this fall to propose legislation to reduce power plant emissions but leave out CO2.

The Clean Power Group is circulating the proposal in Congress and has attracted interest among members, the group's director Joel Bluestein told BNA Aug. 8. He declined to say if any members support it. Like other multi-emissions bills, the Clean Power Group proposal would cut emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury.  A key difference from other plans, though, is that emissions reductions would begin in 2003, Bluestein said. 

In addition, while most plans call for major one-time reductions in emissions, the Clean Power Group calls for gradual reductions in emissions. Bluestein said that, with its continuous annual reductions, the proposal would achieve emissions cuts equal to or greater than most other proposals, as well as those called for by existing regulatory programs.  Gradual but steady reductions allow time for new technology to come onto the market, Bluestein said, but provide a continuing "technology forcing" effect as demand for more effective emissions reductions strategies increases.

To avoid potential economic disruptions from requiring emissions reductions, the Clean Power Group proposal also calls for suspending the reductions temporarily if the cost of reductions rises above a certain level, Bluestein said.

Circuit Breaker

The Clean Power Group proposal calls for using tradeable allowances to allocate emissions among sources, making it
similar to other proposals. If the price for allowances rose above a certain "circuit breaker" level for any pollutant, reductions in emissions of that pollutant would be frozen until the allowance price fell below that level.
				
The Clean Power Group plan shares features of an earlier proposal floated by the Clean Energy Group, formed by several unregulated subsidiaries of electric utilities. However, materials provided by Bluestein said the Clean Power Group is somewhat more aggressive in seeking emissions reductions.  The Clean Power Group was formed by Calpine, Enron, NiSource, Trigen Energy, and El Paso Corp., all of which are involved in power, gas, or coal production, Bluestein said.
		
According to the Clean Power Group, it is proposing emissions reductions that are similar to or greater than legislation (S. 556) introduced by Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chairman James Jeffords (I-Vt.). The Jeffords bill has strong support among environmental groups.  Mercury reductions in the Clean Power Group proposal would be greater than those in the rival industry proposal but less than those in the Jefford's bill, and would not exceed reductions being contemplated by the Environmental Protection Agency until 2012.  The CO2 reductions in the proposal would be
less than that proposed by Jeffords or the rival industry group, or those called for by Kyoto Protocol on climate change but would be more effective in encouraging a robust market for CO2 allowances, Bluestein said.

The Bush administration opposes controlling CO2 emissions because of the potential negative economic effect, but
Bluestein said the Clean Power Group's gradual reductions would establish a system for implementing reductions that would be in place if Congress or the administration decide in the future that CO2 reductions are needed.

I wanted to give you the heads-up that Enron's name will appear in a Wall 
Street Journal article tomorrow on multipollutant.   

As I have discussed with most of you before, we have been working in a 
coalition of companies (temporarily named the "Clean Power Group") including 
El Paso, Trigen, Calpine and NiSource to develop legislative proposals on 
multipollutant emission reductions from the power generation sector.   The 
group has hired Dutko Group lobbying firm to help float some of our initial 
ideas in the Administration and on Capitol Hill.  Mark Irion of Dutko spoke 
with John Fialka at WSJ today and discussed some of our concepts.

Background -- we have developed ideas that focus on making emissions 
reductions in NOx, SO2, mercury and CO2 in exchange for regulatory reforms to 
the New Source Review program.  We have structured these proposals in a way 
that holds multiple benefits for Enron -- promoting development of new 
generation, providing incentives to use new technologies and a diverse fuel 
mix, and environmental benefits with economic protections.  This is also an 
issue of competitiveness, as the big, regulated utilities with high-emitting 
grandfathered sources are trying to mold these issues in a way that would 
disadvantage new entrants.  We have had very positive discussions with many 
in the Administration and on the Hill, and are hoping some of our ideas are 
embraced in energy task force reports, legislation, etc.   

Note on CO2 -- the multipollutant debate has changed somewhat since Bush took 
CO2 caps "off the table" for the U.S. power sector.   We are not forwarding 
ideas that say "we must include CO2 caps", rather we are saying we can do 
multipollutant effectively and economically -- if policymakers want to 
include CO2, we can show them how to do it without causing economic collapse.

We plan to discuss this issue in more detail with many Corp and commercial 
groups at our Emissions Strategy Meeting, which now looks like it will be 
held on May 18 in Houston.  Please let me know if you have questions or need 
additional information.

Please feel free to forward to anyone else you believe should see this note.

Thanks,

Jeff

Steve:

Attached is the final draft of our response to Greenpeace's letter on climate 
change.  I'd like to discuss the follwing when you get a moment -- 

Enron Europe PR and Government Affairs has reviewed and OK'd the letter, but 
there is a debate over one sentence concerning whether we should support 
"creation of enforceable, multilateral obligations" on CO2.   I've 
highlighted the sentence in the attachment, and proposed language which 
softens that statement a bit.   While intellectually it would probably be 
impossible to have meaningful global action without enforceable commitments 
by all countries, saying so outwardly (especially to Greenpeace) could be 
sticking our necks out a bit too far.

Mike and I were also hopeful that you might get a chance to run this by Ken 
Lay before we send -- that's your call, of course.

I'll try to reach you this afternoon to dicuss.

This morning, the U.S. Supreme Court released its long-awaited decision in 
Whitman (formerly, Browner) v. American Trucking Associations, the case 
involving EPA's new rules setting standards for ozone and particulate matter 
(PM).   As you may recall, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, D.C. Circuit 
had ruled that EPA exceeded its constitutionally-delegated authority from 
Congress in crafting the new ozone/PM rules, and also ruled that explicit 
cost considerations could not be used in standard setting.   The Supreme 
Court considered arguments on both the delegation and the cost question.  
Industry petitioners had strongly argued that the federal government must 
consider cost and not just health benefits in setting national air pollution 
standards.  

The Supreme Court's ruling held the following:

1)  Reversed the Circuit Court's ruling on delegation, holding that the EPA's 
ozone/PM rules did not represent an unconstitutional delegation of 
legislative power.

2)  Upheld the Circuit Court's ruling on cost considerations, holding that  
the Clean Air Act "unambiguously bars cost considerations" from the process 
of setting air-quality standards."

3)  Remanded the ozone/PM rules to EPA, holding that EPA's implementation of 
the rules was unlawful and EPA must develop a reasonable interpretation of 
the ozone standards.   

In general, industry is not very happy with the result -- they lost arguments 
1) and 2).   The remand in 3) will lead to some changes in the way the new 
standards are applied (and give the Bush Administration the chance to make 
some cosmetic changes), and may lead to some delays in implementation of the 
rules, but the bottom line is, the new EPA ozone/PM standards will move 
forward.  Among other things, the new rules set an 8-hour standard for 
determining attainment status for ozone and PM.  

We are in the process of analyzing the court's ruling in more detail, and 
will circulate further analysis shortly.  Please contact me with any 
questions.

PLEASE FORWARD TO OTHERS WHO MIGHT FIND THIS INFORMATION USEFUL

EHS Dept. General / Projects:
Life Cycle Impact Analysis - A.D. Little met with environmental, legal, and 
corporate responsibility representatives from ETS, EBS, EES, and Corporate to 
kick-off the first phase of a Life Cycle Impact Analysis of Enron's products 
and services.  Gavin Dillingham is working with Susan Worthen to determine 
all of Enron's products and services, including volumes. This information 
will be used to prioritize which products and services we examine and the 
scope of their life cycle.
EHS Compliance Manager Modules - Susan Worthen authorized the expenditure for 
an EHS Software consultant to assist in the identification and evaluation of 
EHS software system providers.  Enron's requirements will be identified 
through one-on-one meetings with internal stakeholders.  The value of using a 
third-party to facilitate this process will save significant staff time and 
project delays due to the current workload of the task force.
New Employee Orientation - Kelly Kimberly gave her okay on the graphic for 
the orientation booth.  Mark Wilson (Orientation) will finalize the panel and 
confirm availability so that EHS can man the booth and provide materials for 
new employees.
Corporate Responsibility Video - Mike Terraso and Kelly Kimberly identified 
six key business unit executives to feature in an elevator "commercial" 
promoting corporate responsibility vision and values.  Lauren Goldblatt and 
Susan Worthen will meet with Mark Wilson to discuss details.
Annual Report - Hard copies of the annual report are expected by Monday, 
October 2 from the Image Center.  Mike Terraso and Kelly Kimberly will 
distribute to an internal group of business executives and senior management 
with a cover letter.  Other copies will be delivered to Kelly, Mike, Jeff 
Keeler, London PR, and John Hardy for distribution to select groups.
e-Speak - Kelly Kimberly and Mike Terraso were featured on e-Speak to discuss 
Corporate Responsibility.
NARUC Environmental & Energy conference- in response to an invitation from 
NARUC through Sue Landwehr, Mike Terraso made a presentation on future 
natural gas resources and the environmental benefits in electricity 
generation.  He also discussed the energy efficiency , potential  programs 
for  emission credit incentives for energy outsourcing.
Clean Air Award -- Enron was presented an "Energy Innovation and 
environmental achievement award" by industry peers at the "America's Clean 
Air Celebration" held in Washington, D.C. last week in conjunction with the 
World Fuels Conference.   Event co-chairs included former Senator George 
Mitchell, Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, and President George Bush 
(who in his remarks recognized Ken Lay's contribution).  Jeff Keeler 
delivered acceptance remarks on behalf of Ken Lay and Enron.
Climate Change -- Mary Schoen spoke at a Pew Center on Climate Change forum 
in New Orleans for state and local officials interested in climate issues, 
outlining Enron's role in providing market solutions to climate change 
problems.   Jeff participated in Business Council for Sustainable Energy 
strategy meetings to discuss a recent proposal forwarded to the UN by the 
United States that may have the effect of disadvantaging early development of 
gas and renewable energy projects.  Jeff will be coordinating with INGAA, 
NGSA and other gas and renewable companies to prepare analysis and response 
to the US delegation to COP6 in the Hague, upcoming in November.
Greenfield Capital Projects:
Venezuelan LNG - Joe Kolb was contacted by James McMillan (development 
engineer) seeking input to assist him as he responds to the Venezuelan 
environmental agency's questions on the EIA.  Their questions focus mainly on 
the nature of the waste that will be generated and how it will be disposed of.

Acquisitions:
Privatenel (Nicaragua) - Don Stevens has been informed that the group is 
reevaluating the numbers provided and a decision on the direction of the 
project is expected next week.
Project ISAGEN (Colombia) - The privatization was initially halted by the 
Colombian judicial system due to a lawsuit filed by the  Medellin local 
utility company (EPM).  As of 9/22/00, the sell off has been reinstated and 
the government will now allow EPM to enter a bid.  The Colombian government 
has qualified EPM, Enron, AEA, and Union Fenosa to bid for the project.  
Sandy Verma has informed me that the project is currently on hold.  The 
instructions are to get the due diligence completed so if it comes alive 
again we have all the work completed.
Project Crane (Quebec, Canada and Port Angeles, Washington) - Don Stevens met 
with Wayne Mays and Robert E. Anderson regarding additional environmental 
questions for AGRA Simons to respond to on the project.
Project INGA (California and Pennsylvania) - RTP Environmental has completed 
their site visits and have supplied preliminary environmental findings.  Don 
Stevens prepared a response for ENA on issues noted by RTP in their 
preliminary environmental findings.  A meeting with Dave DeLaney is scheduled 
for Thursday, September 28, 2000.
Project Dragon (Southeast Asia) - Don Stevens forwarded information as 
requested to Enron's Bangkok office regarding NOx emissions at the Changzhou, 
China facility.  The lender's engineers are currently reviewing the 
environmental due diligence.  Enron is still negotiating with the seller. The 
project may complete around early November.
Military Base Privatization (Texas AFB) - Don Stevens provided environmental 
base line scope of work per Charlie Thompson's request for Dyess AFB, 
Goodfellow AFB, Lackland AFB, Laughlin AFB, Randolph AFB, Sheppard AFB, 
Ellington Field ANGB, Fort Bliss, and NAS JRB Fort Worth.
CWT Thermo-Depolymerization -EES Bruce Stram has requested an environmental 
analysis of the technology. EE&CC  has completed a review of the processes 
involved and is satisfied with the technology.    Don Stevens will set up a 
meeting with  to discuss various environmental issues regarding the project.

Regulatory Technical Analysis

EES Meeting - The Regulatory Technical Analysis Team met with Roger Raney and 
John Nixon of EES to discuss the operations of EES and  the services that the 
RTA team can provide to EES.

ETS Environmental Procedures - Jim Peterson met with Sue Fernandez of ETS to 
discuss changes to the intranet version of the ETS Environmental Procedures.

Houston Non-Attainment Regulation Comments - Marc Phillips compiled and 
submitted Enron's comments to TNRCC regarding the Houston non-attainment 
regulations.

Greenhouse Gas Emission Credits - Marc Phillips is discussing the possible 
use of greenhouse gas emission credits as payment for the methane emission 
survey work Indaco performed at Bushton compressor station. If the deal can 
be completed, it will be presented in a talk by John Shafer at the EPA 
Natural Gas STAR conference in mid-October.

NFPA Proposed Code Revisions - Russell Tucker reviewed 368 currently proposed 
revisions to the NFPA codes and standards to identify those having impact on 
any Enron companies. This review was prompted by feedback from interviews 
conducted with the safety managers of Enron companies in which several 
indicated the NFPA and related building codes were important to their 
operations. Identified for further investigation were proposals on design 
changes for fire control water spray system net flow rates for bay area 
offshore platforms and changes to the Industrial Fire Brigade member 
qualifications to achieve job performance certification.
 Asset Operations

EPA Acid Rain Workshop - Gus Eghneim is attended an EPA workshop for acid 
rain designated representatives.  EPA  discussed the latest developments to 
the acid rain program and other implementation issues.

Stack Testing and CEMS Certification at Wheatland Power - Gus Eghneim 
submitted petitions to EPA to delay any stack testing until summer 2001.  The 
delay would save EES OEC and estimated $400,000 by allowing the plant to 
perform the test during routine operating times and not just for testing. The 
petitions are anticipated to go through the policy review committee by 
October 2, 2000.

State Inspection at New Albany Power - New Albany Power was inspected by the 
State of Mississippi on 9/22/00.  No issues were identified in the 
inspection.  

Safety Video Project Script - Scott Watson devised "rough draft" script for 
the New Hire Employee and Contractor Safety Video projects.

Gaza Palestine Power Plant - Scott Watson completed new Hire Safety/Health 
Training Outline as well as shipped training materials to Gaza.  This 
training is to be conducted on October 7th & 8th, 2000 at the Gaza facility.

Legislation

Pipeline Safety -- Legislative situation still remains active, with a strong 
possibility that the House will take up the Senate-passed legislation early 
next week.   In anticipation of resistence from some Democrats who are 
opposing the bill for purely political reasons, we have stepped up lobbying 
efforts with key Democratic constituencies and other interest groups who can 
provide support to the legislation (gas users, governors, steel industry, 
etc.).    Jeff will be speaking on this topic at the ETS management 
conference on Wednesday, October 4.

MTBE -- prospects for legislation this Congress are looking bleak.  The only 
possibility for legislation to move is to attach the Senate Environment 
Committee-passed bill to an appropriations bill, and many key congressional 
leaders are opposed to this strategy because of the controversy surrounding 
the legislation.   We are making sure that key advocates are armed with 
industry transition/conversion funding amendments in case a last-minute 
effort to attach an MTBE ban to some moving legislation is attempted.   

Intelligence/Strategies

Clean Air Act/New Source Review -- the EPA Environmental Appeals Board last 
Friday rejected an appeal by TVA of the EPA's enforcement lawsuits charging 
TVA with multiple NSR violations as a result of plant modifications.   Jeff 
Keeler provided EGM and ENA commercial groups with intelligence as to the 
likely outcomes before and after the ruling, and provided information 
regarding TVA's appeal to a Federal District Court upcoming in November 2000.

Clean Air Act/New Source Review -- Jeff Keeler provided analysis to ENA Gas 
Storage developers working on a project involving Intermountain Power 
Authority in Delta, UT.   ENA is proposing installation of technologies that 
would use gas to increase the utilization of existing 1600 MW coal unit, 
which could raise serious concerns about EPA scrutiny or enforcement of NSR 
regulations.  Jeff also provided ENA commercial and EHS staff with 
intelligence on EPA letters of inquiry (which usually precede NSR enforcement 
actions) sent to Pennsylvania non-utility coal plants, 3 of which ENA is 
considering acquiring.

Clean Air Act/NOx SIP Call -- Mary Schoen was successful in negotiating with 
TVA and Tennesee air regulators, reaching agreement that Enron's sources 
would receive an allocation of 500 tons of NOx per year (the levels that our 
facilities are currently permitted for).    Earlier proposals would have 
limited or completely prevented Enron from receiving NOx allowances.  Mary 
also testified before the Illinois Pollution Control Board on their SIP 
development, advocating fair allocation of allowances to new sources and 
market-based trading systems.    

Clean Air Act/California Air Pollution Offsets -- Mary Schoen held meetings 
with ENA West developers regarding the shortage of air pollution offsets 
(required by local air quality districts) needed to develop power projects.   
Jeff and Mary will be developing strategies for creating or obtaining offsets 
and working with California developers in the near future.

Environmental Product Strategy meeting -- Stacey Bolton continues to receive 
positive feedback from last week's meeting with commercial groups on 
opportunities related to green power/renewables.   Stacey is working on 
developing a comprehensive analysis of markets for renewable energy, 
incentive monies, and supply/demand issues so that we can identify potential 
opportunities for Enron businesses.   Also, in anticipation of EES' 
development of a power quality group, Mary and Stacey will also be working on 
analysis of opportunities for distributed generation and other power quality 
related markets.

Environmental Disclosure -- Stacey submitted comments to the Texas PUC on a 
credit-based accounting system for environmental disclosure and met with the 
PUC in support of Enron's positions.   Stacey is also developing a white 
paper on credit trading for use in Maryland as they develop rules for 
disclosure.

EPA Comments on Combined Cycle turbines - Marc Phillips submitted Enron's 
comments to EPA regarding their guidance document on control requirements 
during permitting of combined cycle turbines. Enron supports EPA's 
flexibility in considering control options other than SCR when determining 
the control requirements.

TNRCC Comments on Houston Non-attainment Regulations - Marc Phillips is 
preparing Enron's comments to TNRCC regarding their proposed regulations for 
the Houston Non-attainment area. Enron will be supporting the Business 
Coalition for Clean Air (BCCA) comments, but will have additional comments on 
the cap and trade program and engine control requirements. The draft comments 
will be circulated on Friday for submittal on Monday.

TNRCC Inspection of Mont Belvieu facility - Marc Phillips assisted plant 
personnel with a TNRCC air inspection of the Mont Belvieu underground storage 
facility.

Greenhouse Gas Emission Credits - Marc Phillips has been discussing a 
possible trade with Indaco, a company that surveys gas pipeline compressor 
stations for methane leaks. Indaco will perform a survey at a station in 
Kansas in return for greenhouse gas emission credits. He has been talking to 
Enron traders to determine the value of a greenhouse gas credit.

Enron Day of Caring - Russell Tucker provided employee safety oversight 
during the Enron Day of Caring activities at the Depelchan Children's Center. 
Safety concerns encountered ranged from the intended use of Benzene 
containing materials without proper personal protective equipment to 
inhalation, skin contact and fire hazards in handling flammable solvents. 
Safety supplies were ordered and distributed prior to the start of the 
projects for the hazards known to exist.

Enron Ergo Program Evaluation - Russell Tucker reports 50% of the 3 AC Enron 
proposed Ergo Program evaluations are complete with some program bugs being 
reported and already being addressed by the software development team. All 
exit interviews report very positive on the program itself and highly 
recommend it. Linda Adels continues to work with EDS to get the CBT program 
installed and the workstation assessment available on the Internet for the 
Enron Building participants. EDS is requiring a security request be made for 
each person to load  the CD-ROM's and updating of the Internet browser on all 
the involved computers. None of these problems would be present with these 
programs installed and run from the Enron Intranet, which is the intended 
method should the program be adopted for global use. 

Environmental Notice on Corps of Engineers Revisions - Jim Peterson is 
preparing an Environmental Notice on the Corps of Engineers revisions to the 
nation-wide permit regulations.

Enron House Presentations-Mike Terraso made EHS organization and role 
presentations in London to the operations/engineering group sponsored by 
Brian Stanley and the government affairs group sponsored by Mark Schroeder .  
The annual EHS report was reviewed with the groups.

US-UK Discussion Group on Security and Human Rights in the Extractive Sector 
-Mike Terraso participated in the US State Department/ British  Foreign and 
Commonwealth  Office sponsored review of the draft agreement on security and 
human rights.  Other industry participants included Occidental Petroleum, 
Freeport -Mac Moran, Conoco, Chevron, Shell , BP, Rio Tinto, Texaco.  NGOs 
represented were Prince of Wales, Amnesty International, International Alert, 
Business for Social Responsibility, and Human Rights Watch.  The revised 
draft agreement will be sent to participants by the US State Department on 
September 29th.

Conference Board Chief EHS officers Council - Mike Terraso , at the request 
of the Conference Board, made a presentation on corporate responsibility and 
reputation to the international conference convening in London.

 Shell International Oil and Gas- Mike Terraso met with Shell International 
governance and EHS management.  Mechanisms to better coordinate personnel 
visits, audits and action plans , contractor reviews were discussed  and 
agreed upon.

Cuiaba II - Joe Kolb  reports that OPIC release of funding for Cuiaba I is 
now the end of September.  This means that work on the compressor stations 
will not begin in earnest until then.  I expect to view proposed and 
alternate compressor station locations during next visit to area now expected 
to be in late October.  Edgar Zuleta (Corp EH&S) in Bolivia is providing 
valuable assistance in coordinating trip plans.

BMPs - Joe Kolb is waiting for a response from Norm Spalding (EE&CC) whom 
Jerry Martin assigned the proposed pipeline BMPs for review.  A message has 
been left with Norm.  A response was promised by the end of last week.   Bill 
Osborne (GPG) received feedback from Steenberg and Shafer in GPG.  All 
comments helpful and none propose significant changes to document.  Bill 
Osborne has sent BMPs to others within GPG.  GPG reorg may delay responses.  
Wilson Dietrich (Enron Broad Band) has indicated that he will be the proper 
person to review fiber optic BMPs.  The consultant is proceeding with work on 
the electric transmission and fiber optic BMPs.  Wilson will be sent draft as 
soon as it is received.

Project Dolphin - Joe Kolb met with Michael Johns (contact employee of EE&CC) 
to discuss status of environmental component of this middle eastern pipeline 
project.  Things are moving slowly.  An RFP has been sent out and responses 
from 7 environmental consulting firms  are being reviewed.  The RFP is for 
the EIA and EIA field work.  They expect to choose a consultant in about 2 
weeks.  Field work is expected to begin after the first of the year.  The 
project has been scaled back.

World Resources Institute Conference - Susan Worthen represented Enron at the 
WRI Conference in Washington, D.C., which featured panel discussions on a 
number of environmental and social issues facing corporations.  Besides 
corporate representatives, Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, The Nature 
Conservancy, Habitat for Animals, World Wildlife Fund, Conservation 
International and the NRDC.  Many recognized and applauded Enron for its

Yesterday, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed a non-binding resolution encouraging U.S. engagement on climate change.

The passage of the resolution shows growing momentum in the Senate to address climate change and pass legislation that would encourage reductions in greenhouse gas emissions -- leaving the issue of whether to pursue voluntary or mandatory programs open.

The resolution was broad enough that both Kyoto Protocol opponents and supporters felt comfortable with the language.  Please see article below.

On other climate change related Hill activity, the Senate Government Affairs Committee is scheduled to mark-up climate change legislation today (S. 1008) sponsored by Senator Robert Byrd (D-W. Virginia) and Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska).

S. 1008 would require development of a U.S. climate change response strategy with a long-term goal of stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S.  The strategy would seek ways to mitigate emissions and promote technology innovation, climate adaptation research and efforts to resolve scientific and economic uncertainties.  It would authorize spending of $4.9 billion over 10 years.

Of interest to Enron, the legislation includes incentives and research and development funding for a broad range of clean energy technologies, including clean coal, renewable energy, energy efficiency and fuel cells.  

I will keep you posted on new developments. 

Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to receive copies of the legislation.

Senate Committee United in Seeking Bush Action on Emissions
By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM
WASHINGTON, Aug. 1 - A Senate committee unanimously approved a nonbinding resolution today that called on the Bush administration to develop a plan to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and to take part in international negotiations on global warming.
A chief sponsor of the resolution, Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, said its purpose was to make clear "that the Bush administration's current posture of sitting on the sidelines is unacceptable."
The measure was approved, 19 to 0, as an amendment to a bill authorizing the programs of the State Department. The companion State Department bill passed by the House in May contains similar language.
The resolution was carefully written so that administration supporters could feel comfortable voting for it. Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska, one of President Bush's chief allies on global warming, said he voted for the measure because it endorsed the president's position that any global-warming pact should protect the economic interests of the United States and have participation by developing countries.
In Bonn last week, 178 countries reached agreement on rules of the Kyoto Protocol, a 1997 treaty requiring industrial powers to limit emission of gases like carbon dioxide linked to global warming. 
The United States, the largest producer of greenhouse gases, was alone in rejecting the treaty. President Bush called it "fatally flawed" because it would place no emission restrictions on developing countries and because, in his view, compliance would be so expensive it would damage the American economy.
Administration officials have said they are working on a position on global warming but have refused to make a commitment to have a proposal ready for presentation at the next international meeting on the Kyoto accord in October.
In Congressional testimony last week, Christie Whitman, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said, "We're still a long way from knowing how to solve the problem."
But especially since Democrats took control of the Senate two months ago, Congress has been aggressively challenging the president on environmental issues.
While the resolution has no binding effect, lawmakers seem likely to pass one or more measures this year intended to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide. The main question is whether the restrictions will be mandatory or voluntary.
The crucial paragraph of the resolution adopted today by the Foreign Relations Committee expresses the "sense of Congress" that the United States should take part in international negotiations on global warming and should offer a proposal at the meeting in October that protects the economic interests of the United States and requires developing countries to limit emissions.
Another paragraph specifies that a Senate resolution approved, 95 to 0, in 1997 before the Kyoto accord was made final "should not cause the United States to abandon its shared responsibility to help find a solution to the global climate change dilemma."
The 1997 resolution, sponsored by Senator Hagel and Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, expressed the view of the Senate that emission restrictions should be placed on developing countries. Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader, and other administration supporters have said the Byrd-Hagel resolution showed that senators from both parties were opposed to the Kyoto treaty.

shift which serves as a strong indicator that Congress will face new

FORD PREDICTS END OF CAR POLLUTION
The Independent (UK)
6 October 2000

Internet:
http://www.independent.co.uk/news/UK/Environment/2000-10/ford061000.shtml

The 100-year reign of the polluting internal combustion engine is coming to
an end, Bill Ford, chairman of the Ford Motor Company, said yesterday. It
will soon be replaced in motor vehicles by the hydrogen fuel cell, which
emits no pollution whatsoever and so can reduce the build-up of greenhouse
gases causing climate change, Mr. Ford, great-grandson of the company's
founder, Henry Ford, told the Greenpeace Business Conference in London.

In a remarkable speech from a motor manufacturer, in which he proclaimed his
own environmental credentials, Mr. Ford, 43, accepted that the automobile had
had a serious negative impact on the environment, and that his industry had
wrongly played down the threat from global warming.  And the head of the
world's second biggest car company raised eyebrows even further when he said
that he could foresee the day when people would not want to own cars, but
merely have access to mobility.

Detroit-born Mr. Ford, who has been chairman since the start of last year,
proclaimed that climate change was the most challenging issue facing the
world and that anyone who disagreed was "in denial". Ford itself had moved on
from that position, he said. But he felt the Kyoto protocol, the 1997 pact in
which the industrialised nations agreed to try to limit their emission of
greenhouse gases, would not provide deep enough cuts to halt global warming.
Only the marketplace, making new technology widely available, could tackle
the problem.

A fuel cell creates energy by an electrochemical process similar to that in a
battery: it lets hydrogen and oxygen react together to produce electricity
and water vapour. It does not run down or need recharging, working as long as
the hydrogen fuel is available, but most importantly, it does not produce any
CO2, the basic by-product of any carbon-based fuel such as oil, gas or coal.
Every major car company in the world is throwing huge sums into developing
the technology: Ford is spending $1bn (?690m) between now and 2004, while
Daimler-Chrysler, regarded as the leader in the field, has spent $700m. All
the main manufacturers have prototype fuel-cell cars running and there is a
race to bring them to market. Honda and Toyota expect to do so in 2003, while
Ford and Daimler-Chrysler are aiming at 2004.

"I believe fuel cells will finally end the 100-year reign of the internal
combustion engine," Mr. Ford said, adding that the technology was "the holy
grail" of the motor industry. Prophesying the demise of car ownership, he
said:  "The day will come when the whole notion of car ownership is
antiquated," he said. Mr. Ford was reflecting advanced motor industry
thinking, which suggests many people might not want to pay for a car of their
own if they could be guaranteed mobility on demand from a local hire network.

Alan Stringer is working to identify the locations of metal storage 
warehouses, etc. in order to conduct an EHS review.  We have been unable to 
determine if any environmental due diligence was conducted prior to the 
acquisition.
Annual Report
Graphics Department is currently working on the layout and design.  Frank 
Smith is revising the Environmental Disclosure Statement.  Jeff Keeler is 
circulating a revised Climate Change Position statement.  No word received 
from Kelly Kimberly regarding the approval status of the Chairman's Statement 
and Social Responsibility statement.
Quantitative Risk Analysis
Don Stevens and Susan Worthen met with Thermoretec to review preliminary 
screens for the Quantitative Environmental Risk software currently being 
developed.
ENEL, Nicaragua Due Diligence
The government was supposed to meet this week to determine the power 
generation privatization schedule.  Meantime, the commercial team is 
re-evaluating to determine potential value.  If project proceeds, due 
diligence could occur between August 1 and end of September.
PEP, Panama Due Diligence
Enron is looking to exercise its option to purchase the PEP power plant, 
located within the boundaries of the existing BLM facility.  An environmental 
due diligence was conducted approximately 2 weeks ago.  Donnie Willmann is 
meeting with Rene Van Horde (BLM Plant Manager) to discuss ambient air 
quality impacts and needed modifications should we purchase the PEP 
facility.  

MTBE Legislation
Draft legislation has been released by the Senate Environment Committee that 
would eliminate the fuel oxygen mandate and phase out MTBE (subject to 
maintaining similar environmental benefits) and mandate use of "renewable 
fuels" (to get the support of ethanol).  We are working to have provisions 
included for MTBE producers, most likely in the form of some kind of 
incentives for converting to production of other additives.   The only 
possible date that the legislation could be marked up in the Senate 
Environment Committee is next Wednesday, July 26 -- that is not very likely, 
so consideration of the legislation may slip to September.
Pipeline Safety
There has been a great deal of activity in the Senate and House trying to 
negotiate solutions that would allow the legislation to move forward this 
year.  In the Senate, the McCain legislation that passed out of the Senate 
Commerce Committee must be fixed to industry's satisfaction in several ways 
before Majority Leader Trent Lott will allow the bill to be taken up on the 
Senate floor.  In the House, we are working with House Transportation 
Committee Democrats and Republicans on development of bi-partisan legislation 
(which will be much less onerous than the Senate bill) that can be introduced 
and quickly moved through the House.   Action on both sides will likely take 
place in September.
Clean Air (State Implementation Plans for NOx)
Tennessee:   Originally, the state's SIP allocated sufficient allowances for 
TVA and Enron generating facilities (Brownsville, Gleason peakers).  The 
state air regulatory agency has just advised us that they have re-drafted 
their SIP and reduced the amount of allowances they will give Enron by 75%.  
We will be working actively to have our allocation restored to workable 
levels.
Illinois:  Enron has organized a meeting of other IPPs next week in Chicago 
to coordinate advocacy efforts on the Illinois SIP, in which the current 
trend is to allocate allowances to existing generation and disadvantage 
newer, cleaner generation.
Alberta Power Purchase
Jeff Keeler's group have been asked to provide detailed analysis of the 
potential effects of environmental regulations on an ENA Canada power 
purchase deal involving several older coal generation assets in Alberta.  We 
have provided regulatory information, and are assembling data on the possible 
costs of emissions control options that could affect prices in the future 
under several different regulatory scenarios.
California Reporting Error
We have been working closely to deal with an error in the data EES submitted 
on their 1999 annual report to the California Energy Commission and the 
Center for Resource Solutions (the agency that administers the Green-E 
program).  The error was related to reporting of a "green" product EES 
offered to their large commercial/light industrial customers, offering 100% 
renewable energy for the first 5,000 kwhs per month at no additional 
charge.   The error could put us in violation of requirements involving EES' 
Annual Report to the CEC, Fuel Content Label and Green-E certification.   
Information about the error is NOT known outside Enron, but we have advised 
Peggy Mahoney of EES Public Relations.   Stacey Bolton is coordinating on 
this issue with EES legal and the California Government Affairs office.

Pete,

I would like to weigh in on this, if you don't mind.  First of all,  I 
requested meetings with the audit and EHS folks to understand our procedures 
and our status.  So, no fair ranting at Don.  Secondly, your note brings to 
mind what I find the most troublesome about our process as it currently 
stands.  It is not now, nor will it be in the future the audit department's 
responsibility to ensure that corrective actions are taken as a result of the 
audit process.  It is the responsibility of the business leader and the 
business management.  So, follow up with the companies should have been a 
communication from you to the business unit head, not from Don to the 
business and Don to you.  

But, we are going to work all of this out and in the meantime, we aren't 
going to get crosswise with each other.  This is going to be an "open kimono" 
kind of place and no information is going to be managed away from me.  I will 
be staying on top of things and I will be involved with all of the support 
groups, with the business leaders and with the executive managment..  And, 
problems that are uncovered will be owned by all of us responsible for the 
business and the appropriate handling of those issues will be a matter of 
performance between the business and myself.

So, please, calm down and let's all get off on the right foot.  Enjoy your 
holiday, darn it!

Rebecca

Don - really - this kind of upsets me - I thought you were going to call me 
if we were having any problems - this report looks like crap and is not 
reflective of actual status - I know TGS has completed most of its 
outstanding items -  Does your team call and follow up with the individual 
companies - requesting a status report ?    If so give me the names of who 
called and who you talked to  and the date of the call.   What is the concern 
about Cuiaba - they got a 90 + score -  TGS and Centragas are in South 
America - not carribbean.   Why did you not list the scores ?     Really - I 
think this report and the handling of transmitting this information is 
completely different from my understanding of our understanding of how this 
is supposed to work.    You were going to follow up with the companies and 
let me know if there were any problems and I was going to go fix the problems 
-  Report says there are problems and the first I hear of it is when  you go 
and report to my bosses.   This does not begin to reflect the concepts we had 
discussed.

Guys, for your information and a heads up.  I am going to be visiting with 
Rebecca and Jim this afternoon on their support going forward on timely 
completion of action items as well as support that the audit program is 
mandatory not optional.  We have always had both of you guys support so no 
problem there.  David, you may want to talk to Stephen about IGL. and Pete 
you may want to look at Cuiaba.  If I can help, please let me know.

Yesterday, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved VA/HUD/Independent 
Agencies appropriations bill (which funds EPA) and included legislative 
language stating that EPA should harmonize the NOx SIP and 126 deadlines for 
SIP submission and compliance.   As you may recall, under the NOx SIP Call 
the courts have required states to submit SIPs to EPA by October 31, 2000, 
and recently moved the deadline for sources to comply with the state plans to 
May 2004.   While the Section 126 rule will be litigated this fall, the 
courts have not moved the deadline for sources to comply with this federal 
NOx regulation from May of 2003.

Industry supporters of this language are optimistic that this legislative 
language increases the chances that the SIP Call and 126 rules will be 
harmonized.  If the language passes, it will have the force of law -- 
depending on how forceful the final language is, EPA may be compelled to 
harmonize the laws.  On the other hand, this also increases the visibility of 
the language and could increase opposition to its inclusion in the 
appropriations bill as the House/Senate Conference Committee considers the 
bill.  The language was not in the House version of the bill, and the 
Administration could weigh in with a veto threat that could scare off Senate 
negotiators in the end.

This would be a significant development in NOx regulation, in that if this 
language becomes law, we would have more certainty that generation sources 
would not likely need to comply with NOx regulations until May 2004.  Right 
now, industry still faces a May 2003 deadline for compliance with the 126 
petitions, unless the litigation or this legislation changes things.

We will keep you posted as developments occur.

Linda:

I have revised my memo on Chris Hessler, my recommendation for the AA for Air 
slot at EPA, based on some recent developments.  If you have forwarded on to 
Ken Lay, please send this new updated version.

Because Gov. Whitman's credibility and clout in the White House has been 
damaged somewhat in the last week beacuse of the Bush announcement on CO2, 
her recommendation of Chris Hessler for this job may be taken less seriously.

We are hearing that C. Boyden Gray's choice -- Jeff Holmstead -- is becoming 
a more serious candidate for the job, based on his more conservative 
credentials.  Senator Inhofe's choice is no longer considered in the running 
at all.

My recommendation is still that we back Hessler.  We have nothing to lose:  
1)  we are supporting Whitman (which could help our initiatives at EPA).  2)  
we are supporting Hessler -- if he gets the job, we have a great relationship 
with the key EPA air person, if he doesn't, he's still the key Senate staffer 
on Clean Air and can help us tremendously.

If you have any questions or concerns, please call.

Thanks,

Jeff

EPA's Mercury determination was released today.  It can be accessed at 
www.epa.gov/mercury

It will likely take some time for EPA to develop these regulations -- the 
time frame is proposed rule by 2003 and final rule by 2004 -- but this is a 
significant step in that it now formally puts mercury on the radar screen for 
power generators, in terms of planning for emissions controls.

It is a positive step that EPA included in its determination an intent to 
develop "flexible" compliance measures -- i.e. trading -- for mercury.  It 
also means that mercury will most likely be included in any efforts to 
develop "multi-pollutant" legislation in the next Congress.

Please call me if you have any questions.

EPA DECIDES MERCURY EMISSIONS FROM
POWER PLANTS MUST BE REDUCED

To protect public health and the environment, EPA Administrator Carol M. 
Browner today announced that the Clinton Administration will require 
reductions, for the first time ever, of  harmful mercury emissions from 
coal-fired power plants -- the largest source of such emissions in America.  
After extensive study, EPA determined mercury emissions from power plants 
pose significant hazards to public health and must be reduced.  The agency 
will propose regulations by 2003 and issue final rules by 2004.

"Mercury from power plants settles over waterways, polluting rivers and 
lakes, and contaminating fish. Exposure to mercury poses real risks to public 
health, especially to children and developing fetuses," Browner said.  "The 
greatest source of mercury emissions is power plants, and they have never 
been required to control these emissions before now.  Today's decision to 
address this problem marks a major step forward in the Clinton 
Administration's ongoing efforts to protect public health and the 
environment."

Exposure to mercury has been associated with both neurological and 
developmental damage in humans. The developing fetus is the most sensitive to 
mercury's effects, which include damage to nervous system development. People 
are exposed to mercury primarily through eating fish that have been 
contaminated when mercury from power plants and other sources is deposited to 
water bodies.  Once mercury enters water, biological processes can transform 
it into methylmercury, a highly toxic form of mercury that builds up in 
animal and human tissues.  EPA recommends that subsistence fisherman, 
pregnant women, and others should always heed state fishing advisories.

Under the Clean Air Act, EPA is required to study toxic air pollution from 
power plants in order to determine if additional regulations are necessary in 
order to protect public health.  EPA reported its study to Congress in 
February 1998.  That study concluded that of all toxic pollution examined, 
mercury posed the greatest concern to public health.  An earlier study 
concluded that the largest source of human-made mercury pollution in
America was coal-fired power plants.

After completion of the study, the Clean Air Act required EPA to determine 
whether to proceed with the development of regulations.  Today, EPA is 
announcing that it has affirmatively decided that mercury air emissions from 
power plants should be regulated, because mercury poses the greatest hazards 
to public health.

EPA will propose regulations by December 2003 and will begin developing those 
regulations shortly.  Industry, the public, and state, local and tribal 
governments will have an opportunity to participate in the process.  Then, 
EPA will issue final regulations by December 2004.

The Clinton Administration already has taken a number of aggressive actions 
to reduce mercury air pollution, including significantly reducing allowable 
emissions from municipal waste combustors, medical waste incinerators and 
hazardous waste combustors.  When fully implemented in 2005, the existing 
rules will reduce total human-caused mercury emissions by nearly 50 percent 
from 1990 levels nationwide.

On November 11, 2000 President Clinton called for a dramatic new approach to 
reduce air pollution from America's power plants.  The President highlighted 
the benefits of adopting a combined strategy to address all of the major 
pollutants emitted by power plants, including mercury, sulfur dioxide, 
nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide.  A comprehensive strategy that addresses 
all of these pollutants together will provide more certainty and flexibility 
to industry, making it the most cost-effective way to control the emissions 
that threaten public health and the environment.  As the Clean Air Act 
requires, the regulatory process to control mercury will proceed under 
current law.  However, at the same time, the Administration encourages the 
Executive Branch and the Congress to work toward legislating a comprehensive 
four pollutant approach, which will benefit the public health, the 
environment, and the economy.

Today's decision will appear soon in the Federal Register, but is accessible 
immediately on EPA's mercury web site at: www.epa.gov/mercury   Also, today 
EPA is posting, on its website, mercury emissions from every coal-fired power 
plant in the country.  This is consistent with EPA's strong commitment to 
provide citizens with information about pollution in their communities.

I'm writing to invite you to a meeting on August 16 to discuss origination =
and trading opportunities in the renewable power sector. On April 1, we est=
ablished the Renewable Power Desk under the umbrella of West Power Trading =
and West Origination here in Portland. The Desk was established to apply En=
ron's power marketing and development expertise to the growing market for g=
reen power in the WSCC. Within 6 weeks we closed our first deal (a five yea=
r fixed-price sale of energy and renewable energy credits worth several mil=
lion dollars) and I am very excited about the opportunities in this market =
nationwide. I've spent a lot of time during the last several months establi=
shing contacts with the key developers and marketers in the renewable power=
 market, and Stacey Bolton of Enron's Environmental Strategies Group has ga=
rnered a very solid understanding of the regulatory environment and supply/=
demand dynamics in markets across the country. When you combine Enron's ski=
lls in the wholesale market with our huge customer base at EES and the incr=
easing level of green power committments in the public and private sectors,=
 it becomes readily apparent that Enron is poised to be a major player and =
market-maker in the renewable power sector.

I would like to meet with you and other representatives of Enron's trading =
and origination groups on Thursday, August 16 from 12-3 to discuss a coordi=
nated commercial response to the renewable power market on a nationwide bas=
is.  Lunch will be served. Please let Stacey or me know ASAP if you or a de=
signate from your group will be able to attend.  We will contact you with a=
 follow-up call/e-mail the week of August 6th with a room location and agen=
da, and hope you will be able to attend.

EPA Stormwater Phase II Regulations - Jim Peterson provided information to 
EES in response to an inquiry about the effect of the stormwater phase II 
regulations on military installations.

EPA Guidance on BACT for Combined Cycle Turbines -  Marc Phillips is 
preparing comments supporting EPA's guidance on BACT for combined cycle 
turbines. The document indicated that SCR may not always be required and that 
dry-low NOx controls may all that is required in some circumstances. Jeff 
Keeler is circulating the comments for internal review. Comments are due 
September 18.

TNRCC Houston Non-Attainment Regulations -  Marc Phillips is preparing 
comments on the proposed Houston non-attainment regulations. It is 
anticipated that the comments will generally support the Business Coalition 
for Clean Air (BCCA)  comments with some added technical issues raised. Ken 
Lay sits on the BCCA board and Mike Terraso and Rob Bradley sit on the 
coordinating committee.

Enron Proposed Ergonomic Program - Russell Tucker and Linda Adels (Corporate 
Wellness) began loading the proposed pilot ergo training and analysis 
programs on the employee computers that are to participate in the program 
evaluations. It was found that the computers in the Enron building are locked 
down so much that neither of the programs could be loaded, requiring a long 
process of EDS involvement to affect the loading process on several different 
LANs. No problems have been encountered in 3AC.

EES/Eli Lilly Project - Susan Worthen gave a presentation to Eli Lilly 
regarding the corporate EHS organization, policy and management system, and 
performance, as well as participate in discussions of our operating 
experience and procedures in a Q&A session.  Other Enron participants 
included Rick Wood (Enron Bldg Services Inc - a subsidiary of EES) and Dave 
Nutt (Corp environmental counsel). The presentation and discussions were in 
response to a 10 page EHS questionnaire Lilly submitted as part of a due 
diligence they are conducting prior to signing a multi-million dollar 
out-sourcing agreement with EES.

Annual EHS Report - Positive feedback is being received externally and 
internally on our first report.  It will go to press this week with copies 
anticipated the week of the 25th.  Requests for copies have been received (so 
far) from John Hardy, Kelly Kimberly, EES, and EGE&P.

New Hire Orientation - Angela Sprock (Orientation) has relinquished 5 minutes 
during the Vision and Values for the EHS/Corporate Responsibility info.  The 
panel for the booth is awaiting Kelly Kimberly's final approval.

Project INGA - ENA East/West - ENA is investigating a stock purchase of 
Ahlstrom Development Corporation's holdings in five coal fired facilities.  
Two of the facilities (ACE Generation Company and Mt. Poso Cogeneration 
Company) are located in California.  Three of the facilities (Panther Creek 
Partners, Inter-Power Ahlcon LP (Colver) and Gilberton Power Company) are 
located in Pennsylvania.  ENA has contracted RTP Environmental Associates to 
conduct the due diligence (fatal flaw) and site visits.  The site visits were 
conducted 9/5/00 - 9/8/00 for the California facilities and 9/12/00 - 9/15/00 
for the Pennsylvania facilities.  Don Stevens will be conducting the 
environmental review of RTP's report.  The commercial objective is to 
restructure the PPA.

Project Dragon - Asia - Don Stevens was requested to supply a revised copy of 
the environmental due diligence to the Enron's Bangkok, Thailand office.  The 
lenders engineers will be reviewing the report within the next two weeks.  
The lenders engineers will submit any questions regarding the acquisitions to 
Don Stevens for further discussion.

Project Crane - ENA - ENA is looking to acquire 100% of Daishowa Paper Mfg. 
Co. Ltd's forest products operations in Quebec City, Quebec, Canada, and in 
Port Angeles, Washington.  The assets include seven paper and board machines, 
four major pulping facilities and integrated utility systems, a sawmill, a 
chip handling facility and forestlands in Quebec and Maine. Wayne Mays ENA 
requested EHS review assistance . Don Stevens will review the due diligence 
report and submit comments to ENA.  The environmental due diligence was 
conducted by AGRA Simons Engineering Global Solutions.

EHS Intranet Site - Gavin Dillingham has been working on the EHS Intranet 
site. The current status of the site is that the elaboration document is 
being completed. The intention is to hand over the document to the Internet 
developers/architects by the 1st of October. They say it is possible to have 
a rough mock-up of the site by the middle of October. 

Compliance Calendar - Gavin Dillingham and Gary Allen have been in talks with 
DS&S about locating a Compliance Management Calendar, which will be a modular 
software program that will allow the addition of other EHS modules to this 
system such as audit software and Health and Safety tracking software. 

EHS Management System document - Gavin Dillingham is also working on the EHS 
Management System document. All the data for roles and responsibilities has 
been gathered and placed in the document, as well as the EHS Management 
Description document. Also, the latest EHS council charter, the latest 
organizational chart, the standardized forms and documents and the due 
diligence schematic have been added. Gavin Dillingham will be moving over to 
the 3AC on Monday, the 18th of September.

Environmental Disclosure:Stacey Bolton made a presentation to the TX PUC in 
their kickoff meeting for environmental disclosure.  A trader accompanied her 
in order to familiarize the desk with some of the overlapping issues between 
environmental  disclosure and the renewable energy program. Stacey filed two 
sets of comments with the PUC, and subsequently met with Chairman Wood, 
Commissioner Judy Walsh and Evan Roe (staffer to Commissioner Perlman) to 
discuss environmental reporting and the trading program.  Hap Boyd was also 
in the meeting.  We got nearly everything we wanted in the renewable energy 
protocol, except for emission data on the credit itself.  Stacey will 
continues to advocate this issue and try to find a forum to get emissions 
data included (due to bypassed emissions opportunities and it puts more value 
on cleaner renewable fuels like wind).

International Environmental Emergency Responders -  David Ronkainen gave Don 
Hawkins (corporate crisis response manager) a  list of International 
Responders, so that a decision could be made in regard to negotiating 
agreements.

Dabhol Community Relations Management - Henry Van met with Dabhol Community 
Relations Management and visited all the community projects (technical 
school, elementary school, horticulture project and jetty for fishing 
village) in relation to the offsite impacts of the oil leaks.  The 
communities did not express active concern.   

Spill Update - Ed Zuleta participated on the TR conference call on spills.  A 
summary was prepared and mailed to key personnel in HSE group.

Wheatland Power - Enron  (Gus Eghneim) submitted a petition to EPA Region 5 
to waive the stack testing requirements and rely on CEMS ( continuous 
emission monitoring) certification to demonstrate compliance.  If approved, 
the waiver will save Enron approximately $400,000.  The savings are realized 
by not operating the plant during a low demand period only for the purpose of 
conducting stack test.  In low demand period, plants operate at a huge loss.

Pipeline Safety Legislation - Jeff Keeler continues to actively participate 
in the GPG efforts in the House to get passage of a bill similar to the 
Senate bill passed last week.

MTBE Legislation - Jeff Keeler continues to follow the progress and advocates 
including a transition costs to a new production process if a rider is placed 
on an appropriations bill.

Environmental Product Strategy Meeting -  Stacey Bolton has organized a 
meeting with business units involved or interested in pursuing various 
opportunities arising from environmental policies, such as renewables, energy 
efficiency, and green power marketing.   Representatives of EES, ENA 
Origination, ENA West Desk, Enron Wind, and Enron Global Markets will be in 
attendance.  Stacey and Mary Schoen will present updates on environmental 
regulations and incentives for green power oppportunities.  They will also 
foster discussion among businesses about upcoming bids/commercial partnering 
opportunities, evolving markets for renewable credit trading, and potential 
product offerings.  This meeting is aimed at adding value and creating 
business opportunities for the Enron busniess units.

Pipeline safety legislation -  Jeff Keeler is working with members of 
Congress and others in industry on a strategy that would get the House of 
Representatives to pass the pipeline safety legislation recently passed by 
the Senate.  This strategy avoids several procedural steps in Congress and 
allows the House to pass a bill that is fairly acceptable to industry, rather 
than waiting for the House to produce its own bill and move it 
independently.   This is a very fluid situation right now, but we hope to 
have a positive result by next week.

MTBE legislation -   the Senate Environment Committee passed MTBE legislation 
last week, containing a number of provisions that are bad for MTBE producers, 
including a ban of MTBE, granting states the ability to waive the fuel oxygen 
standard, and mandating increased ethanol use over 10 years.   Two Enron 
amendments were voted on -- liability protection and an MTBE producer 
"transition retrofit fund" -- and defeated, but Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison 
received a commitment that transition fund issue would be addressed before 
the bill moves on to the Senate floor.   Jeff will be working on this issue 
with Senate staff over the next few weeks.

TVA environmental litigation - we supported the Enron Global Markets 
emissions/coal desk in getting information on TVA's appeal of lawsuits by EPA 
on violations of New Source Review rules.  A is expected by an EPA 
Administrative Appeals Board on 9/15, in which TVA will likely lose.  TVA is 
appealing in Federal Court, arguments to be held in early November.   
Intelligence on this is extremely important to several Enron business units, 
as much of the electric utililty industry is watching to see whether EPA can 
prevail in its enforcement activities against coal plants, and utilities' 
future decisions about fuel choice, control technologies, etc. could be 
affected by action in this case.

EPA enforcement activities- we have learned that EPA is now targeting 14 
non-utility, coal-fired boilers in Pennsylvania for New Source Review 
enforcement.  We will be providing more detailed information to traders that 
could find opportunities from this action, as well as Enron originators 
currently working on acquisition of several QF coal assets in Pennsylvania.

TX Disclosure -  Stacey Bolton made a presentation to the TX PUC in their 
kickoff meeting for environmental disclosure, in which Enron power traders 
also participated to gain insights on the relationship between the disclosure 
and renewable energy trading programs.   Stacey also filed two sets of 
comments w/ the PUC, and subsequently met w/Chairman Wood, Commissioner Judy 
Walsh and Evan Roe (staffer to Commissioner Perlman) to discuss environmental 
reporting and the trading program.  Enron Wind was also involved in these 
meetings.  Enron got nearly everything we wanted in the renewable energy 
protocol, except for putting emissions data on the credit itself -- which is 
an issue Stacey will continue to pursue in TX and other states.

Pew Center symposium on Climate Change - Mary Schoen will be representing 
Enron in a Pew Center symposium on climate change in New Orleans on Thursday 
9/21.   Members of industry, government and environmental groups will be in 
attendance, and Mary's panel will be discussing what businesses are doing 
about climate change.

 America's Clean Air Celebration - Enron will be honored next week at 
America's Clean Air Celebration, a dinner put on in conjunction with the 
Hart/IRI World Fuels Conference in Washington, D.C.   Enron and Ken Lay will 
be presented with an award recognizing excellence in energy, environment and 
innovation, which Jeff Keeler will accept and present remarks following.   
Other participants are BP/Amoco, Texaco, GM and a number of other industry 
peers.   President George Bush and Senator George Mitchell are co-chairs of 
the event -- Bush will make videotaped remarks including a mention of Ken 
Lay's contribution to clean air, and Mitchell will MC the event.

I have compiled the following memo for commercial and regulatory groups to provide information on the potential international greenhouse gas emissions trading market.  It also discusses factors that impact current prices for greenhouse gas emissions transactions and identifies future market influences.  

Given current regulatory uncertainty and the patchwork of greenhouse gas emissions initiatives, a liquid market with a clearly defined commodity is likely several years (or more) away.  However, given the growing interest in compliance hedging, opportunities to package and sell verifiable greenhouse gas emissions reductions could increase in the near future.  Further, with the launch of the U.K. emissions trading program and rule development for the EU trading program expected next year, it is likely that the definition of a verifiable greenhouse gas emission credit will become more clear.

Given the range and varying circumstances under which current greenhouse gas emissions transactions are occurring, Enron business groups should begin to capture (define ownership and package) internal greenhouse gas reductions, look for opportunities to integrate greenhouse gas emissions concerns into existing risk management products and, Enron assets that are significant greenhouse gas emissions sources, should assess and manage exposures.  

Environmental Strategies Group will convene a commercially oriented greenhouse gas strategy discussion on Tuesday morning, November 20 (EB 8C1) to explore these opportunities across business groups.  

 
Please contact me with questions, comments, or suggestions for further analysis.
