Jeff,
We will work with you and the site operators to ensure the new system is 
performing as expected, and the site operators have sufficient documentation 
to use this tool.
This should be accomplished by July 12.

Subject: New Download tool

It was brought to our attention that there was confusion downloading the wind 
data using the new Download tool deployed by the SCADA team.  To ensure we do 
not loose any data, please continue to download the weekly data according to 
SUB 352_C until the instructions using the new tool have been resolved.  

You can download the data using the new tool in addition and send in both 
sets of data.  We will send out clearer instructions the week of the 7th at 
which time we will update the SUB 352_C to include the use of the Download 
tool.

Any questions pleas call

The contractual availability definition in the owner report  is the same used 
throughout 2002 and implements the contractual availability definition upon 
which annual availability warranty calculations are based.  Contractual 
availability is defined (Survey - DT -RT -MT - LOT)/(Survey - LOT - 
MTprorated) where Survey is the maximum possible number of hours in the 
calendar period and MTprorated is the percent of the 48 hours of maintenance 
per year credit that can be taken credit for.    DT, RT, MT, and LOT are 
controller counters that accumulate the hours, to the nearest second, that 
the turbine is in a downtime fault, repairtime, maintenance time, or line out 
condition.   The DT, RT, MT, and LOT values are corrected for communication 
loss at the beginning and ending of the time period of interest.  The 
correction is based on counter values in the next or previous time interval 
and is not based on an assumed 90% of communication loss rule.

I assume that Mr Marshall means wind direction curtailment by his phrase 
"columnar shut-down".   The wind direction curtailment is not yet implemented 
in the field and therefore there are no downtime losses.  The curtailment 
info sent earlier by Mark Fisher was "utility" and not "wind direction 
curtailment".

W.C. Marshall, as per the note below,  has already provided the availability 
figures for Jan and Feb 2002.

The performance testing results must come from Engineering.  System 
Performance Group is not involved.

The transfer function to compute m/s windspeed for the NRG #40 anemometers is 
(0.765*Hz)+0.35.

Can you help me find the following information for Peter Simpson. ?I have 
attached the April Status Report which should answer the Jan and Feb 
availability question. 




Renee.............Kurt may need to know what availability and wind speed data 
was sent to Peter. 


The following information would also be helpful:

- definition of the availability figure given in the monthly
availability report, in particular the definition of the numerator shown
in the spreadsheet;

- duration of down-time due to columnar shut-down;

- availability figures for January and February 2002; 

- if available, any results from performance testing undertaken to date;

- the transfer functions that have been applied to the wind speed data
provided.

Subject: Wind related faults

Hi Hollis,

Here is the document that we wrote in response to Ben Bell's inquiry about 
high wind faults:



I can briefly describe the "low wind" fault (#146 "turbine stopped due to 
calm). The low wind set point is parameter 2.1 ("start spinning speed") which 
is a generator speed reading and has a nominal value of 48 rpms. If the 
generator speed falls below this value by 15% (48 - (.14*48) = 40.8 rpms) for 
30 seconds then the fault occurs. The turbine will restart when the wind 
exceeds 3.5 m/s with the turbine not spinning. (I'm going to check with the 
control engineers in Rheine to assure my interpretation of this is correct.)

Here are some documents that describe how the parameters/set points relate to 
individual faults. This document describes the faults in some detail:



This document shows the nominal values of the parameters for all turbine 
types. (This is an "unofficial" version and my not match the parameter 
settings in the field exactly):



This document describes the parameters in greater detail. (Some of these are 
subject to interpretation so if we have questions about exactly what the 
parameters do we usually have to as the engineers in Rheine for more details):



I hope this helps. If you have further questions ask me.

-Garth

You asked if it was really true that the counters other than ST are stored in 
Visupro.   The answer is yes.   DT, RT, MT, EOT, LOT, and WOT are 
incrementing counters recorded in two Visupro files (one on a daily basis and 
the other on a 10 min basis).   

One final note.  The availability definition displayed by  Visupro is not the 
contractual availability.   It is what has been called Enron availability 
(EA).  I don't know if we want to make the point in the availability 
definition section of the Contract that the displayed availability may be 
different than the contractual definition.  This will eventually become an 
issue in a few months when the owners routinely consult the SCADA system 
without contacting EWC personnel.   Of course, we can make this point in 
written correspondence outside of the contract.   The important thing is that 
the owner is clear on what availability they are seeing as early as 
possible.  Existing project owners have confused what is displayed in SCADA 
vs what is reported in the final Owner's Report.

Hollis - 

Per our last phone call, I made the changes (in red) to the Clipper 
Availability to suite what I believe is a good definition for us 
(incorporates Mark(s) comments which I added).  Please review and comment so 
I can send this file on to Mark Eilers.  Please view this document in a 
Commercial light as spoke, thus looking at what favors EWC.  Please call to 
discuss.

Thanks,
Ilan

PS - Dave Schulgen put together a chart which outlines EWC maintenance costs 
per year for 1.5 maintenance.  His work indicates that 72 hours (rather than 
36/48) should be the standard (with an increase in the later years for 
additional work).  This is reflected in the attachment.

Jim,

Attached is our report for WTG 79 which answers the questions posed by 
Eickoff.  Please note that we provided more information than we were asked 
for in anticipation of additional questions from them, yourself and 
engineering.  In the attached report we have provided graphs which cover the 
previous month (versus the previous week), the production since commissioning 
(through February), and a fault list.

The gaps in the data occur wherever the SCADA system did not record data or 
it was corrupted in some way.  Please note the fault data is particularly 
susceptible to data integrity problems but it does appear that we had pretty 
good data recovery during this period.

In the graph section we included a graph of Gen rpm/rotor rpm which should 
yield the gearbox gear ratio (a constant).  However, interestingly enough the 
values fluctuated from time to time which we cannot explain.

We will have Trent Mesa WTG #30 for you tomorrow morning.

Best Regards,
Hollis

Hi Mark,

Here is the answer to your question about the undocumented fault messages 
(those without text descriptions). They should not influence the statistical 
counters ("turbine OK" still increments after the faults occur) and do not 
effect the behavior of the turbine.

Hi Garth,
we don't know the reason for these 'fault' appearances, yet. It has to do 
with the communication between PC and PLC.
But : it did not influence the status of the turbine, neither it shuts down, 
nor downtime counts up.
In version 1x629 the solve the problem, but the real cause is not solves, 
until now. Clemens will work on it.

What's the time schedule for updating V1x629 ?
Best regards and nice weekend

Most of these fault were logged on turbine 5 and turbine 6 (with a few on 
turbine 7). They are not distributed between all the turbines but isolated on 
a few.

The major question that that operations asked me was which production 
statistic timer was incremented when these conditions were logged. My guess 
is that since none of these stop the turbine that the "OK" timer continued to 
increment. Is this correct? 

The question that I have is: what is causing so many of these messages in the 
log? Do these status messages have any specific meaning? According to the 
documentation there are only about 220 messages that have descriptions in the 
error list data base (in VisuPro v1.27.0.0). Where are the other messages 
coming from? (This is version 13527 Bachmann software.) I think this issue 
was brought up several months ago but I don't think we got any additional 
information.

All,

Attached is the Lessons Learned matrix developed from our meeting last week.  
I want to thank everyone who participated.  There were some who wanted to 
attend but could not because of the GE Integration efforts.  We missed you, 
but your interests were represented by people from your teams.  

Originally, the Top 15 issues were identified and voted on by all functional 
teams.  During our session last week, three of these issues were combined, 
making the final list 12 issues.  The sub-issues, within each major issue, is 
labeled, for example, 1.1, with the root causes labelled 1.1.1.  Dan 
Lindquist did an outstanding job of facilitating our lessons learned 
process.  Normally, we would have hired a third party facilitator, but due to 
cost constraints this was not possible; therefore, we utilized Dan.  
Collectively Dan and I developed this matrix.   As you will note, there are 
numerous global issues.  The plan is to coordinate a meeting with Germany to 
discuss face to face all of our collective issues, so that improvements can 
be made for our mutual benefit. 

The plan is to develop a series of Six Sigma Green Belt projects from these 
issues, as a part of our Six Sigma training, which will come in the next week 
or so.  Dan is already coordinating this with a GEPS Six Sigma Black Belt 
person from Atlanta.  The plan is to assign two people to each "Green Belt 
Project"; therefore, start thinking about which project you may want to be on.

If I have missed anyone within your team, please forward on to them.  Thanks

Best regards,

Jeff

I know we've seen discrepancies in time-stamping of data.
I do not know if this exact issue has been seen.

Greetings,

To my best memory, the Systems Performance Group is cost center 267.  I 
picked up my American Funds retirement packet tonight from the front desk, 
and the sticker on the front states cost center 269.  Have we changed cost 
centers or is this a typo?

Hi Mark,

The message at 10:47 says the the computer was rebooted at that time.  That 
is about the only way that I know of that this message would be recorded.

When the TrbCurtail Service is started it does not remember what turbines 
were curtailed.  It waits 10-minutes after starting before issuing any 
commands to calculate a 10-minute average.  After the 10 minute startup wait, 
the first command output from this program would have released all turbines 
that were currently curtailed, and curtailed new turbines as needed to keep 
the 10-minute average MW output at the curtailment setpoint.

So at 10:57 any turbines that were curtailed before that time would have been 
released.
The curtailment log file Visupro creates at the turbine should be able to 
verify this if needed
.

Database:

 System
Index Number Date/Time Msg
10843 840006029 6/19/02 10:36 Energy curtailed  -> Turbine curtailed

Subject: Curtail200206.db Question

Joe,

Attached is the Curtail200206.db file. I have a question about a sequence of 
events. For turbine 840006029 on June 19th the turbine is "Energy curtailed" 
(Index = 10843), THEN it has the message "Turbine Com Established" (Index = 
10855). Then there are no other messages (for that turbine) until a "Energy 
curtailed" message (Index = 11134).

Is there anything I can assume about the time between the curtailment 
messages? For example, was the turbine uncurtailed when the com established 
message was recorded? Or are did the turbine become uncurtailed and no 
message was recorded? 

Thanks,
Mark

Ignore if this is the second time you got this.

Of course, my only involvement with this was through eve's dropping.  We 
should be prepared to discuss what sort of process we would need to implement 
this request.  I'm sure I'll be asked by Jeff M.  

We can talk after the meeting today.

Subject: Availability reporting

Jeff-
There is a definite need for a monthly Availability Report to be issued on a 
regular basis.  This is a valuable sales tool that we haven't been able to 
utilize lately.  I understand that the information coming from Germany for 
the European fleet has not been received on a timely or regular basis.  As 
the US information is processed through Hollis' group and Mark Walker has 
recently received updated European information, this would be a logical place 
for the report to be compiled.

Attached is a copy of the graph we have used in the past for inclusion in bid 
responses (updated in the GE Wind Energy format).  Although this document is 
for the 1.5MW turbine only, the GE Wind Energy fleetwide availability 
percentage is also required.  As the availability is currently low, we will 
also need some sort of explanation included.  Dan Lindquist's group has 
prepared a summary overview of the reasons for the low performance.  Ilan 
will be discussing with Bob what information can be released to the customer 
on a monthly basis.  An external summary should be released monthly with the 
availability numbers.  This may need to be coordinated with Dan Lindquist's 
group.

Ilan Caplan has provided Mark Walker with formulas and information for 
comparison purposes against the statistical methods used by Vestas for our 
turbine availability.

We should have a process implemented as soon as possible.  If you have any 
questions or concerns, please contact Alan Nueman.

Attached please find a new Statistical Process Control analytic which 
displays the turbine performance for your site.  The report pdf is a summary 
of the other two reports and delineates which turbines fall outside the 2 
sigma line for each category.  The other two reports provide more detail 
regarding the turbine performance including the degree to which a turbine 
falls outside the 2 sigma line.

Mark, Ron, Alaadin and Hollis: 

I am uncomfortable, extremely uncomfortable, with trying to make this test 
pass by using data that is not synchronized within the same period of the 
test as the remaining turbines. This is not in keeping with the spirt of the 
test. It is clear that we did not pass the ATP even this second time and that 
the cause of our failure is the failure of the Omnitron's to provide us with 
reliable data. 

I wish to point this out in my weekly SCADA report to add futher backbone to 
our need to replace the Omnitron switches with Hirschmann's. 

Lets not spend any more effort on this particular test, but wait until we 
have the Hirschmann's installed. I will speak with O&M and with our customer 
about this problem. 

Regards

Ilan,

Mark Walker will send a request to Germany for their availability data.  Mark 
will also provide the definitions of Machine availability.  The contractual 
availability is what was included in the memo I handed you when you were in 
my office on Wednesday.  If you need an electronic copy of that  document 
Mark can send it to you.

With respect to making us responsible (as the coordinator) for obtaining the 
Germany availability data:  We have no leverage over our European 
counterparts and cannot compel them to provide this data on a 1 day notice.  
I want to avoid setting expectations that are clearly beyond our control.  We 
will, however, give it a shot. 

I did notice the European data stops in Sep 01 so we need 6 months to fill in 
all the gaps.  Has Becky been unable to obtain any more recent data or is 
this the most current info you have?

Thanks,
Hollis

Subject: 1.5 Fleet Availability

Mark(s) - 

As discussed yest., attached is a copy of the original data file containing 
data for Europe and the US, as provided by Becky Bayne.
Also, I have included a graph which Becky usually provides.  This graph 
reflects machine availability.

REQUEST:
1)  As I don't know where the info. request form is located (please let me 
know), I ask that since Becky is out, that you (as the coordinator) email 
Germany, and ask for the most recent availability numbers (what they usually 
provide), so we can have them by Monday or an alternate procedure to obtain 
this data.
2)  Please email the definitions of (a) machine availability, and (b) our 
current "standard" contractual availability.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks in advance,
Ilan

Subject: RE: 3200 - Desert Sky: final SCADA  Report



Stan,

I spoke to Alaadin when he was on his way to lunch, earlier today,
regarding the content of Section 3 of the Final SCADA Acceptance Test
Results report. My question should probably been addressed to you.

The question is: why are the screen dumps presented taken from records
of April 19, deviant from the data that Alaadin and I witnessed on April
18, as recorded on the typescript sheet 'Met-Mast Data record during
SCADA final ATP' that is included in this section of the report?

[The latter is correct, with the exception of a typo in the wind speed
data for turbine 31: this should read 11.6, not 1.6.]

The content of the three tables in Section 1, under the heading of Test
7.0 is erroneous:

a) the date should be April 18 and the times should correspond with the
records on the typescript sheet;

b) a number of wind speed and temperature values do not correspond with
those on the typescript sheet. This appears to result from an effort to
correlate data from April 19, as it appears on the screen dumps, with
data recorded on April 18.


I have some comments on the text preceding the tables.  I shall write
separately regarding that.


Peter.

Subject: Conversation with Gary

Kurt,
 As a follow up on our phone conversation, here are the main points that were 
covered in the meeting with Gary. Please let me know if there are any 
questions.

Gary was unable to find any information in the TSIA that outlined the 
procedure that we currently use to record maintenance time of 4 hours per 
month instead of recording the time as it is used. Gary had a conversation 
with Mike Kelly whom assured him that this has not been done in the past and 
seems to be an incorrect way to report the maintenance time. Gary also stated 
that this would lead to error in availability in months were there were 28 
days in the month compared to a month with 31 days

Mark Howller & Mike Kelly have also conveyed to Gary that using 10 min data 
to calculate estimated power production and availability was an industry 
standard. In an attempt to complete the sale of the site, Zilkha has been 
asked to provide 10 minute data to their potential customers. Grays questions 
is why are we not using the 10 minute data files to calculate our 
availability.

Gary also wanted to know how the Mon.db file could be more accurate then the 
Minana.db file, if the Mon.db file is taking samples from other files, and 
the other files have missing data like the Minana.db does. He also wanted to 
know how the Mon.db file could be verified if there happened to be a mistake 
as there appears to be on turbine 9 for the month of April. Where is the raw 
data proving the numbers in the Mon.db file.

We also discussed the faults on turbine 4 for the month of April. Gary stated 
that the faults he outlined in his letter came from the errordev.db file. He 
was unaware of the state of the turbine at the time of the faults or if they 
contributed to down time or not. I am researching this and will inform you as 
soon as I know.

Gary also per warned me of an Email that is planning to go out to Mike 
Miller. The letter states that over the past 6 months our turbines have 
performed poorly, and we have attempted to mislead them by over stating out 
availability. We have also misstated the amount of parts used on site and we 
have not explained problems to Zilkha, that we are experiencing with our 
turbines. He also states that we have not provided maintenance's to our 
turbines in the last 7 months.

For clarification, the "Vestas availability" you talk about is not specific 
to Vestas nor is it based on any Vestas contractual availability.   This 
availability is a multi- industry standard for simple "series component" 
availability.   There is no credit for maintenance or repair time time which 
is why a 3-5% loss is considered acceptable for long term performance.   The 
3-5% loss includes maintenance.   An availability metric that shows the 
turbine as available during repairs would be very objectionable to future 
owners.    Pausing the turbine during maintenance may be acceptable if the 
long term goal is set accordingly.   For example, if the turbine is always 
paused during maintenance then the long term system goal should be close to 
the 99.5% goal for grid availability.

Subject: Calculating "Vestas Availability"

Guys,

In an earlier e-mail Ben made the statement:  "Have you been able to 
determine what these numbers would look like using Vestas' definition of 
availability:  Hours of Wind Turbine in Operation mode X 100 / Hours of Grid 
in Operation Mode." 

We now need to develop a methodology to calculate the Vestas definition using 
VisuPro data.  I think this boils down to:

Vestas Avail = (SOT+WOT+EST+RT+MT)/(ST-LOT)

Where:

SOT = System Okay Time
EST = External Stop Time
WOT = Weather Out Time
LOT = Line Out Time
DT = Down Time
RT = Repair Time
MT = Maintenance Time

ST = SOT+EST+WOT+LOT+DT+RT+MT

This calculation is based on an operating assumption that the current day 
machines are placed into "pause" mode during maintenance and repair time.  As 
a result the availability counters will continue to increment even when the 
turbine is being serviced.  

Let's get together and discuss,
Hollis

I will distribute copies of the initial draft of QFD chart to you.  The goal 
of the meeting is to clearly define the customers, collect all known and 
expected customer requirements (their WANTS),  prioritize the WANTS,  
brainstorm HOW we can or do meet the WANTS,  prioritize the HOWS, discuss how 
to organize the findings, and then talk about unnecessary or low value work.  
A customer is anyone we provide services, reports, analyses, data, or any 
other product to.  The customer is the C in COPIS.  

 If you have any time between now and 13:00 hrs then please think of any 
customer requirement (what they want from us) that you are aware of but is 
not under the header "Customer Expectation".   Scribble it on your copy in an 
open cell.   Other than that just bring your copy of the chart to the meeting 
with you.   Thanks.

Klaus,
I need to know which Timer is started for each of the following Fault/Status

Tom, 

Here are the fault paretos of fault counts for all sites for May 2002 
(may2002paretos_faults.pdf). For readability only the top 30 faults for each 
site are displayed. Both Texas sites had VERY high numbers of "wind 
deviation" faults.

I am also attaching a file (from a different work request) that has a pareto 
(by site) of the mean number of faults per turbine (may2002mean_faults.pdf), 
which shows that the Texas sites have the highest mean faults per turbine. 
This also has boxplots of the number of faults by site to show the outliers.

I will do the June data, if still desired, when the data upload is completed.

As always, if you have questions or comments let me know.

Mark

Of course, my only involvement with this was eve's dropping.  We should 
discuss how we would implement this process so I can be prepared to brief

Subject: Availability reporting

Jeff-
There is a definite need for a monthly Availability Report to be issued on a 
regular basis.  This is a valuable sales tool that we haven't been able to 
utilize lately.  I understand that the information coming from Germany for 
the European fleet has not been received on a timely or regular basis.  As 
the US information is processed through Hollis' group and Mark Walker has 
recently received updated European information, this would be a logical place 
for the report to be compiled.

Attached is a copy of the graph we have used in the past for inclusion in bid 
responses (updated in the GE Wind Energy format).  Although this document is 
for the 1.5MW turbine only, the GE Wind Energy fleetwide availability 
percentage is also required.  As the availability is currently low, we will 
also need some sort of explanation included.  Dan Lindquist's group has 
prepared a summary overview of the reasons for the low performance.  Ilan 
will be discussing with Bob what information can be released to the customer 
on a monthly basis.  An external summary should be released monthly with the 
availability numbers.  This may need to be coordinated with Dan Lindquist's 
group.

Ilan Caplan has provided Mark Walker with formulas and information for 
comparison purposes against the statistical methods used by Vestas for our 
turbine availability.

We should have a process implemented as soon as possible.  If you have any 
questions or concerns, please contact Alan Nueman.

Kurt,
I have attached the April Log with some corrections to the curtailments.  The 
lines I shaded blue are typing errors that I fixed.  These will account for 
the negative hours and the turbines with no data. 

 The turbines that are showing hours but no production must be a result of a 
SCADA data acquisition problem.  These entries I shaded in red.  I started 
looking through the list in the April Log but I could not find any errors on 
our side, so you may have to base the lost production on what a particular 
turbines' neighbor produced or lost.  

Call me if you have any questions.

Matt,
Please take a look at this as soon as possible this morning. It appears that 
you may have some entries where the operator used the 12 hour clock instead 
of th 24 hour clock. There are many rows where a turbine is curtailed but the 
way the time is recorded makes it come out with zero production. Call me if 
you need help.

Kurt,

I'm attaching the generated spreadsheet. There are a few problems. Scanning 
through it it appears the site personnel entered some times backwards so 
there were a few negative durations with 0 kWh predicted productions. I also 
do not know what is causing the other 0 kWh productions (it might be low 
wind, or there might be some other problem).

There was a 90.9% data recovery. The predicted production for the month was 
45929604 kWh, the production lost due to curtailment was 21780739 kWh which 
after 97% availability and 2% line loss becomes 20704770 kWh.

Due to the many curtailments at the site this program takes a lot of time 
(today it ran for 2 hours). 

Mark

MINANA files of dec 2001 for FENNER has been loaded.Total number of records 
are 29739.
However there exist large gap in the data,this is due to the turbines are  
not containing full months data.For example some turbines are having from 
10th dec were other have from 12th dec or 22th dec.Please look at the data 
and let me know if any problems are there.

Andre,

Here is a short subset of 10-minute records containing the extreme 
temperature event (approximately 3 hours of before/after data). The turbine 
was #105 at Desert Sky on May 1st. Times are in UTC. The values are 10-minute 
averages.

If you have additional questions let me know.

Subject: Trent Mesa ATP

Hi Mark,
I did the ATP for SCADA system in Trent on April 13th at 11:40am (CT) 4:40pm 
(UTC), it lasted for 24hours. I collected the database files from all the 
turbines.
The following is the observations for the data collected:
Turbines no. 47 & 48 were under major repairs and were not included on the 
ATP, so total number if turbines is 98..
During the night of the test turbines no. 24,25, & 27 stopped collecting 
data, and I reset Visupro application in the morning, so there is a 10 hours 
worth of data lost, I suggest we shift the starting time of the test for only 
these turbines so we can get 24hours of data.
Turbine no. 31 has some repairs done to it during the night of the test and I 
didn't have notice of these repairs, I managed to capture the data for the 
24hours test in four seperate files, two files minana.db and minana_2.db for 
the 10 minute average and statdat.db and stadat_2.db for the status. I 
believe there is 2 hours worth of data still missing.
Turbine no. 90, kept rebooting in the morning and I had to go to the turbine 
and restart the PC, it worked fine for the rest of the day but there is 2 
hours worth of data missing.
Other than that the data looks fine for all the rest of the turbine.
I am transfering the files right now to your folder on the transfer server, 
the folder name is SCADA ATP Trent, and also I will UPS to you by overnight 
delivery the data on a CD.
If you have any questions please feel free to call me at 661-332-6348, I will 
be in Indian Mesa site until Saturday.
Regards,
Alaadin

Mark,
I'd like to expand on Kevin's explanation:

- Time-stamping:  If the owner wants Standard time all year and have a 1 hour 
offset for half the year, that is his decision.  
At the last Daylight-Savings time transition, at all sites we changed the 
clock at the Park PC and the Time Synch routine updated all WTGs.   The time 
change would have to be accounted for in the Central Database (STAR).  We 
wrote a SUB to perform this activity.

- Two versions of VisuPro running on a Plant concurrently:  Kevin covered 
this.  I'll cc Joe Thorpe on this correspondence.

- Writing data to errdev file:  If errdev, or any VisuPro file is open, the 
new data will not be updated on the display monitor.  However, the data will 
still be written to the file, and the next time the file is opened for a 
person to review, the latest data will be shown.

Please contact me if additional information required.

Thank you.
Ron

Mark: 

First, the new version of VisuPro (Version IV) will use standard local time, 
not daylight time. This means that during the year it will be off by one hour 
for 1/2 of the year. 

Second, the plant pc cannot have more then one version and copy of VisuPro 
running at one time. If it does then strange things happen. I will ask our 
SCADA people to make sure that Joe does not run more then one copy of VisuPro 
on any plant pc.

Subject: Questions/Observations about VisuPro

Ron,

While I was at Mill Run/Somerset last week a few things came up about 
visupro. 

First a question about the new version. As I understand it, the new version 
is going to use "local time". Is this local STANDARD time or local time 
(taking Daylight Savings time into account)? The owner's representative 
indicated a preference for local standard time.

Now for a couple of things Joe Thorpe at the site mentioned. He has observed 
that if two copies of visupro are running at the plant, then 10-minute data 
does not get written. Second if visupro (at the plant) has the errdev file 
open, then new data does not get written to the file. Are you aware of these 
observations? If not you might want to contact Joe Thorpe and see if he has 
additional examples, and do some kind of testing. These are probably issues 
with the way that Paradox locks files.

One other comment.  It is still not clear how MT values in excess of the 100 
hours will be handled.   Is EWC to be penalized for these "excess hours"?  
Hopefully this will be a moot or trivial question.

Hollis - 

Per our last phone call, I made the changes (in red) to the Clipper 
Availability to suite what I believe is a good definition for us 
(incorporates Mark(s) comments which I added).  Please review and comment so 
I can send this file on to Mark Eilers.  Please view this document in a 
Commercial light as spoke, thus looking at what favors EWC.  Please call to 
discuss.

Thanks,
Ilan

PS - Dave Schulgen put together a chart which outlines EWC maintenance costs 
per year for 1.5 maintenance.  His work indicates that 72 hours (rather than 
36/48) should be the standard (with an increase in the later years for 
additional work).  This is reflected in the attachment.

Subject: Re-calculation of Monthly Availibility (Mill Run/Somerset)

Gary,

On behalf of the GEWE Systems Performance team, please find a re-calculation 
of Monthly Availability for both the Mill Run and Somerset projects.  The 
following work is in response to your findings regarding availability 
incrementing with no power production above cut in wind speeds, conveyed 
through both Kurt Anderson and through Mark Fisher's meeting with you in 
early June.

The following methodology incorporates criteria discussed during Mark Fisher 
visit.  We are planning to provide some detailed examples later this week for 
your review.  I anticipate we will then discuss the methodology via 
conference.  The intent would be to use this fully automated methodology to 
account for this situation on a go forward basis.

Please feel free to contact myself of Kurt Anderson.

Jeff Duff

P.S.  Due to a transition of our email, please copy any email to @ps.ge.com 
and @enron.com as we are making a complete GE transition on Monday.

Cheers

I already loaded the first week of March to try and capture the last of 
February.  But data is still missing.

Patricia,

This looks reasonable. Another common problem is for the file to be there and 
be for the correct turbine but be for the previous download. That is, the one 
downloading fails to download the newest copy and ends up sending the one 
sent last time. (The opening of the Paradox files to double check what date 
range or turbine ID was actually there is time consuming, isn't it.)

As for the data for the end of Feb, if the data from the first download from 
March is uploaded, much of that gap could be filled in.

Thanks for getting this done. If Mill Run could be next that would be great.

Mark

Subject: Somerset Minana

All Minana  files for Somerset 2002 have been loaded.

The minana Paradox file under 6Feb02 for Turbine 1 contains Turbine 3 data.  
There are no minana files with Turbine 1 data for Feb1 - 5.  This was a 
common problem.  The Paradox file is labeled as being Turbine A but it 
contains Turbine E data.

Minana Paradox files for Feb 26, 27 and 28 are incomplete.  The field only 
captured  50% of the desired data for Feb 26 - 28. 

This is the SPlus graphs that Fisher is used to:




This is the list of data points per day.  A perfect count is 144.  Some of 
the drastic ones were researched.  The Paradox file from the field did not 
contain 144 records.



Let me know if I missed something.

Tom,

The graphs attached are formatted the same as the sample set I sent you 
earlier. As of today, Desert Sky 10-minute data has not been uploaded for 
June 2002 yet, and the data for Jan is nonexistant, so the graphs go from Feb 
to May 2002. 

If you have questions or comments let me know.

Mark

Kurt,
 Per our phone conversation, Mark Fisher and myself have been discussing 
availability with Gary from Zilkha. A question arose regarding the many 
operations of our breaker in the pad mounted transformer that took place 
December through March. Gary's thought is that when we recalculate the 
availability, we need to count these times as down time and not Line Out 
Hours as they have currently been counted. I suggested that according to 
Exhibit GG in the TSIA, LOH is defined in short as any time the grid does not 
meet "(i) the specifications required by the WTG as set forth in the 
Technical Specifications", and Gary agrees with this. The problem is that an 
engineering change on the breaker settings was implemented some time in March 
to reduce the number of breaker operations on site. We are still seeing many 
grid faults in the turbine but not in the PMT breaker. The question that Gary 
brought up is were the original settings of the breaker set to the WTG 
Technical Specifications and operating due to the on going grid conditions OR 
were the settings improper to start with causing the breaker to operate while 
the grid was within Technical Specifications.

Ilan,

I was incorrect in what I told you earlier today regarding the types of 
availability data included in these two reports.  What I told you was that 
both reports include the "EA" (Enron Availability) term and they should be 
the same.  When I checked this out I discovered that the O&M Report provides 
the contractual availability and not "EA".  The MOOP is mislabeled and should 
correspond to the Owners Report.  We will fix this error on the next report.

I apologize for the confusion.

Hollis

Hollis - 

Per the phone conversation earlier today, below is a chart exhibiting the 
differences between the Monthly Operational Report (Mark Fisher) and the 
Weekly MTD (John Ruiz) numbers posted on the web.  Both cases should include 
the numbers through the end of the month.  From what we discussed, my 
understanding is that the chart should pool from the same source.  Please let

Hi,

I know you may have some questions that need to be address during your 
discussions with the representatives from Zilka. It looks like I will be in 
the field starting this Thursday. (I'll be travelling on Thursday morning to 
Montfort if all goes as currently planned.) You should be able to reach me 
during that time on my cell phone. The number is:

 661-332-4018

Please call if there is anything I can do to help clarify any issues.

The training department has already provided recommended changes and 
additions to Joe. If you do not have a copy, let me know and we will send 
them to you. I think the number one issue is what do our customers want. If 
we can make VisuPro provide our customers with all of the data they need in a 
user friendly format, we will have an excellent software program. Be sure and 
review the comments that Gary Vercleeren sent to Kevin.

Attached please find a new Statistical Process Control analytic which 
displays the turbine performance for your site.  The report pdf is a summary 
of the other two reports and delineates which turbines fall outside the 2 
sigma line for each category.  The other two reports provide more detail 
regarding the turbine performance including the degree to which a turbine 
falls outside the 2 sigma line.

Please note that we are still working with the analytic and you will find 
some extraneous characters in the results.  Please add these characters in 
with the main group for which they are intended.  We will have them removed 
from the code next month.

Best Regards,
Hollis

Thanks for taking care of this.  Still have any hair?
I got mine cut yesterday, so there isn't much to pull on...

This data will come in handy, and I'll get the March-May curtailment

As for Mark's email, he has the same sort of address as yours, but I

Please see the attached work request.  With owner reporting upcoming, you 
will have more time for this request.  One issue I saw was estimating the 
lost production during the fault events, but I'll let you discuss this with 
Tom if it will be an issue.  Maybe the new field in the Faults table might 
help?  If so, let me know and I'll push for this do get done.

Joe,
It seems when I exit out of VisuPro I get the "Illegal Operation" message box 
. In the details it states that
"VisuPro caused an invalid page fault in module <unknown> 0000:015clac9"

Although I am able to FTP files and do other commands in VisuPro, should the 
program be reinstalled?

Thanks
John

Mark(s) - 

As discussed yest., attached is a copy of the original data file containing 
data for Europe and the US, as provided by Becky Bayne.
Also, I have included a graph which Becky usually provides.  This graph 
reflects machine availability.

REQUEST:
1)  As I don't know where the info. request form is located (please let me 
know), I ask that since Becky is out, that you (as the coordinator) email 
Germany, and ask for the most recent availability numbers (what they usually 
provide), so we can have them by Monday or an alternate procedure to obtain 
this data.
2)  Please email the definitions of (a) machine availability, and (b) our 
current "standard" contractual availability.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks in advance,
Ilan

hi Mark,

The files-download tool is finished, but before we deploy it to the field,  
can  you please review the Auto-download Program Version 1 spec and let me 
know if it follows the requirements?   Also, I am modifying the code for 
version 2. Thus, it is very important that I hear from you.  Thank you much!

Subject: Re: Autodownload tool  

Kim,

First, Hollis will be out of the office until further notice.  I'll be 
coordinating his tasks for the time being.  Since I don't have the full back 
ground on this development here are my thoughts.

I agree we should work towards the best solution for the task.  It may be 
that the version you are testing is that solution.  The immediate problem we 
are trying to solve is;

1) the sites spend too much time downloading these files
2) we need data consistently and frequently here in Tehachapi, system 
performance team,
3) the sooner we have a solution the more time we will save.

A quick review of the REC document indicates some type of download cycle in 
addition to file format, which would be useful for other reasons.  The on 
site servers are not set up to store real-time data currently, nor is the SQL 
transfer program currently designed to accommodate all of the various files 
listed in either solution.

Last thing, would it be possible for you to send me test data so we can test 
out upload to our STAR db.  There shouldn't be an issue, but this would 
complete a 360 test.

Hi Hollis,

It seems that REC- SCADA is working on the same task as I am, though the 
actual coding has yet begun.  I have coded and now testing at Klondike a 
simplified version of this task (spec. attached).    But before I start to 
modify the code for version 2, perhaps we and REC project leader of this tool 
should come together to derive an optimal decision for this task. What are 
your thoughts?   





User Interface for version 2:

Please note the response from Mike below, and ensure the MOOP accurately 
reflects the turbine count.  Also, we need to adjust the projections for GWh 
to reflect any changes to the turbine count.

Are these the turbines which are on line are producing as of the date of this

these sites with respect to turbine count?

Hi Mark,

I discussed the issue of releasing fault related information to our customers 
(specifically, Zilka) with Kevin. We feel that the information about which 
statistical counters increment during specific faults can be released to 
them. When it comes to specific faults and the circumstances under which they 
occur, the only documentation that goes into any detail is the controller 
document published by the controls group in Rheine. We don't want to release 
the entire document (for obvious reasons) and the information on the cause of 
the faults and related parametes is in the above mentioned document. (We got 
the information for the "Error identification" column from Section 2.2 of 
"Software Description EW1.5 Bachmann-M1".)To interpret this information, they 
would also need the parameter list and we do have parameter lists specific to 
Mill Run and Somerset that are being released through document control this 
week. (I've attached a master parameter list that is not specific to a given 
site. The values in this list may not be exactly the same as the actual 
settings at Mill Run/Somerset).


(This document can be released to the customer)


(This document can be released BUT it is not specific to the customer's site. 
The site specific lists scheduled to be released this week...)


(You can use this to answer specific questions that the customer has but DO 
NOT release this to the customer- for internal use only.) 

I hope this information helps out in your discussion with Zilka.

-Garth

MINANA files of JAN&FEB 2002 for FENNER has been loaded.For jan2002 large 
gaps are there in the data due to turbines not containing full months data 
and also some turbines started from 22nd jan and other from 27th jan.
For JAN 2002 turbine 7 is having less number of records due to duplication of 
records.

For FEB2002 turbine15 started data from 7th feb were as other turbines are 
having from 4th feb.That is the reason it is having less number of records.

Total number of records are 51484.Please look at the data and let me know if 
any problems are there.

Are the leaning towers excluded for both EA and VA?

Did we also exclude the turbines within the 90 day ramp up?

Mark,
Back In January approximately Visualpro was updated a new file was created 
called old errstat.db we also have about 20 turbines off-line at Trent Mesa 
due to leaning towers. It could be that it has been off-line since the 
update. I am also attaching a updated channel list for Visualpro High speed 
running number is still not explained to my satisfaction but, it is 
definitely not Tip Speed the numbers are to small. Let me know if their is 
any further clarification you would like on this list.

Regards,
Paul Landers

Paul,

Here is the formatted pitch system fault information you requested for the 
Trent site. I have several comments.
(1) The data came from the March 20 Trent data download.
(2) 6 turbines did not have the ErrStat file included in the download. These 
are denoted by blank cells in the fault columns in the attached spreadsheet.
(3) While looking through the data, I noticed that there was at least one 
ErrStat file that was downloaded and showed no recorded status messages. I 
checked the corresponding ErrDev file and there were status messages being 
recorded there. I have sent this information to Germany to see if there is an 
explanation.
(4) Turbine 99 is represented in SCADA at Trent by 199.

If you have any questions let me know. I will probably do one of the other 
smaller sites before checking into tackling Clear Sky.

Mark Fisher

In order to expedite the speed of network response in the days when we had 
hubs instead of switches IT/Spohn set up the cabling between my computer and 
Mark Fisher's computer and the network servers so they didn't go through the 
hub like they did for all other users.    In the current rewiring of the 
building will Mark and I be changed to a cabling configuration more typical 
of all other users down here?   This info will help us do limited elimination 
of causes for network problems before we call IT with future problems.

Joe,

Do you have any information on the LKM files created by Visupro.  My 
understanding and review of these files suggests they store a reference power 
curve, and an accumulated wind speed distribution and power.

Question:
1. Do you know if this reference curve is turbine, site, or generic 
specific?  If turbine or site, is it an engineering or warranted curve?  Who 
manages the input of the curve data?

2. I assume the wind distribution is derived from the nacelle anemometer.  Do 
you know if the data has all the same transformations applied as they do in 
the Minana file?

3.  How is the power value derived for the corresponding wind speed in the 
distribution?  Also, how is the reference power for this distribution derived?

I am trying to determine if we need to develop a reference power curve table 
for the Crystal Report application.

Val,

We will have this done and back to you and Philo tomorrow.  We will try to 
put the data into Excel but, due to size, we may have to put it into Access,  
If that is undesirable then we can save it in ASCII.

There will be data gaps.  I cannot tell you yet where they are but we should 
expect them.

Mark,

I am guessing that he wants Stat Dat files for March and April for each 
turbine.  Kurt is going to come by in the morning and explain further.

John - Please prepare a CD with the stat dat files for March and April at 
Dessert Sky (aka Clear Sky aka Indian Mesa) for each of the turbines.

If anyone has any other thoughts on what this might mean please pipe up.

Ward, 

As per your request, attached is the wind data, and curtailment information 
from Clear Sky for the month of January. Please note that due to a lack of 10 
min. data from SCADA, the turbine data for the month of January is not 
available. We are confident that this situation will not be repeated. It is 
also important to note that periods of curtailment were derived from the 
manual log provided by the site. There were 13 periods between 1/22/2002 and 
1/31/2002. Since turbine nacelle wind speeds were not available, 4 met 
stations were selected (0648, 0651,0652,0659). The met station data is 
recorded hourly. The wind speeds were extrapolated to hub height using shear 
estimates. The hub height wind speeds were converted to kWh by applying the 
Clear Sky Power curve. For each curtailment period the kWh values were summed 
to give an estimate from each met tower, the four estimates were averaged, 
the averages were then multiplied by the number of curtailed turbines. This 
generated a estimate for each curtailment period. These values were then 
multiplied by .97*.98 (97% availability and 2% line loss) as spelled out in 
section 2.(b) of the PPA, to get a net loss. For January 2002 the sum of 
these estimates was 1,770,692 kWh.

 If there are additional requirements you may contact me at (661) 823-6886 or 
direct Rich Simon to contact Mark Fisher of our Data Analysis group at (661) 
823-6545.

Subject: Turbine Availability

Gary, with the recent acquisition of Enron Wind by GE Wind Energy, and the 
subsequent departure of Marion Horna, I will be assuming the role of customer 
advocate for the Mill Run/Somerset project. In light of this development, I 
would like to ask for your assistance in resolving an issue of mutual 
interest.   
During the May 2nd conference call on which we discussed the gearbox noise 
issue at Mill Run, Rick Winsor indicated that you had arrived at a lower WTG 
availability number than what was reported by our data analysis group for the 
January through March time period. 
I would like to bring this issue to the attention of the appropriate 
personnel here in Tehachapi and get this issue resolved. At your earliest 
convenience please forward to me the methodology that was utilized to arrive 
at the lower availability number. I am confident that we can work through 
this issue and agree on the availability calculation.

I look forward to hearing from you. 

Best regards

Well, we need it for the month of January because the owner has requested it, 
I need to get together with you and call Bo to figure out our strategy for 
telling the owner that the data is incomplete and we cannot supply a report 
for Jan., right?

Kevin,

We routinely prepare that data and it is available for all our turbines.  The 
problem is that the consumption/production is a net number for a 5.5 minute 
period so we do not know what the turbine loads are, only what they are 
netting.

This leaves two questions:

1. What is the turbine consuming during normal operation (including standby, 
full power, etc) and
2. What is the potential financial liability a particular site has for 
consumed power.

The first question we cannot answer with the SCADA data because the SCADA 
data is a net number.  This one will require actual measurement of data to 
ascertain.

The second question we cannot answer with the SCADA data unless the frequency 
of the measurement coincides with the 5.5 minute SCADA periodicity.

Regarding the second question:

Since we will be charged a different rate for consumed power (a "retail" 
rate) versus the rate we are paid for produced power (the "wholesale" rate) 
we cannot depend on a net metering solution with an arbitrary frequency.  
Taking a look at extremes by way of example:  If we are netting on a monthly 
basis then we will never owe anything under a net metering solution.  This is 
because in normal operation the turbine always produces more power than it 
consumes on a monthly basis.  On the other hand if the frequency is based on 
a 1 minute periodicity then we will have 2 instances of individual minutes.  
One would be a minute in which we produced power and sold it at the retail 
rate and the other would be a minute where we consumed power and purchased it 
at the retail rate.  This is because the turbine is not producing power 
during every minute of the month.   There are an infinite number of 
permutations because you can set the time interval to an infinite number of 
values.

Our current value is a net number, based on a 5.5 minute interval.  If the 
utility is basing their measurement on a different frequency then we will 
certainly get a different total for power consumed,

The other issue is the location of the measurement.  If the measurement is at 
the substation then the net number is an aggregate of the wind turbines which 
dampens the impact of a particular turbine (good for us).  If the measurement 
is with our SCADA system at the individual turbine then we maximize the 
impact if a particular turbine is down for any reason while the remaining 
turbines are operating (bad for us).

Therefore to more fully understand the 2nd question from Mark we also need to 
know 2 additional points:

1.  What is the proposed frequency for the metering?
2.  Where is the measurement going to take place?

As mentioned earlier, we can provide the net production/consumption for each 
5.5 minute interval.  However, I think the only way we can fully address this 
question is to run a test program based on the answers to these two last 
questions.

Regards,
Hollis

Mark, Mark and Mark: 

I have reviewed the attached power curve and clearly it will not help in 
formulating an answer to your question. 

I would like to ask Mark Fisher to look at a typical installation (any one of 
our field sites) and give us data on kWh consumed by several turbines over a 
multi-month period with data arranged month by month. Perhaps one or two 
turbines at Monfort would be the best because we can look at a whole year of 
data. This would tell us what was produced and what was consumed in energy. 

Mark Eilers, what do you think?

I wanted to thank all three of you for coming to meet with us this morning. 
It is very exciting to have GE in this business. I am forwarding the 
following e-mail since I thought you would want to know what the feelings 
currently are in the trenches at Zilkha in terms of the PA projects. The 
projects were commissioned six months ago so I can understand the frustration.

We look forward to seeing you at AWEA and to a long and fruitful relationship.

With best wishes,

Michael

Kurt,

I have a few questions relating to the Monthly Reports prepared for the Mill 
Run and Somerset Wind Farms.  They are as follows:

* On April 5th the Main Circuit Breaker located within the pad mounted 
transformer on WTG#7 at Mill Run was torn apart and replaced by Marvin Blanco 
(GE Turbine Tech.).  In addition, on or about this same date IGBT's were 
replaced within the same turbine.  Nowhere in the Monthly report are these 
issues mentioned, please explain?

* WTG#9 at Mill Run experienced downtime between 4-17-02 at 10:00 A.M. and 
4-24-02 at 4:00 P.M. this equates to 7 days - 6 hrs. or 7.25 days.  Assuming 
WTG#7 operated fault free the entire month (its availability at 100%) except 
for the above mentioned period of 7.25 days, the best possible availability 
that could be realized would be            (1-(7.25/30) x 100) = 75.8%.  
Please explain how the availability of this turbine can be 78.6% as listed in 
the Monthly Report?

* On 4-25-02 WTG#8 experienced several hours of repair time due to worn HV 
cable which had been rubbing against the ladder rungs at the yaw deck level.  
Apparently, the bundle of cables sways or moves during normal operation and 
over an extended period it caused significant wear to the protective 
coating/insulation.  Why was this not mentioned?  Are other turbines 
experiencing this problem?  Is there a retrofit being considered?

* On 4-28-02 a storm event with heavy winds rolled through the area.  
Turbines #2, #3, and #8 at Mill Run all experienced faults requiring 
component replacements.  The Summary on individual turbine activity in the 
monthly report does not reflect this, neither does the Consumption Log also 
contained within the Monthly Report, please explain?  In fact, WTG#8 required 
a new rack of IGBT's as a result of this storm event and no mention is made 
in the report to an IGBT replacement for this turbine.  Furthermore, on 
4-30-02 a new rack of IGBT's was installed in WTG#8 and they were blown upon 
start up.  IGBT's are major components, As a minimum I would expect the 
monthly reports to include major component failures/replacements.

* I need clarification on what exactly Section 7. EXHIBITS is attempting to 
demonstrate.  Surely, this is not an attempt to list all faults that a 
turbine experienced for the current month.  How are you selecting the faults 
you choose to include on the list?  For example, WTG#4 lists one (1) fault 
for the month and clearly that was not the case.  As one example, check the 
operational activity for WTG#4 on 4-22-02 where it experienced multiple 
faults among them "Gearbox Oil Pressure Too Low."

We have to have a better account of the operational history of these wind 
farms through GE Wind Monthly Reports.  I understand that the company as a 
whole has been consumed with many other tasks relating to the recent 
acquisition and that your attention has been elsewhere.  Nevertheless, we 
need to work together in order to improve the accuracy and attention to 
important details that is lacking within these reports.

I look forward to working with you and Joe to make these projects better and 
more accountable.

Best Regards,

Gary

Hallo Jeff,

the Plant index number is a number generated by the Paradox database engine.
It is not an information from the PLC.
 
First point: This number is not available on the ParkPC at the moment. (But 
that can be changed)

Second point: For your database you want to use an information of an other 
database system.
You depend on the correct work of the other database system.
If you have consecutive numbers you only know that you have the same 
information as the local paradox database.
You can not be sure that you have every single error message from the PLC, 
because the PLC error messages have no index number.

I think the plant index number is only needed if you import external data in 
the SQL database.

Comments and results?

		 Thema: Re: Index Number
Gentlemen,

In considering the solution about the Plant index number recorded in most of 
the Visupro tables I have discovered one issue we will have by not having 
this on the SQL server.  Since the Plant index number records the sequence by 
turbine, we can use this to detect when gaps in the data occur.  In 
particular, in the Errdev we expect a consecutive Plant index number for each 
turbine ID and status message.  

If we push the data to the SQL server and create an auto number, the status 
messages for each turbine will have a sequential auto number, but NOT be 
consecutive.  Using the Plant Index number has become a very useful field in 
analysis of the Errdev data.

We need to store the Plant Index as it is written.

Comments?

initiated by Garth in the earlier draft.   The yellow coloring indicated 
changes or comments added by Mark Walker.  Paul Landers and Kim Nguyen were 
very helpful in gathering data on the existing result of faults and errors 
and I coordinated with two Field Crews to ensure that the counters were 
compatible with Field Ops requirements.   

One important result is that several counters cause the maintenance time 
counter to be incremented even though they also would be used for repairs.   
If the rotary switch on the controller panel is religiously set to "maint" or 
"repair" before all maintenances or repairs then there will not be any 
excessively large number of maintenance hours.  Field Operations will request 
further emphasis on using the rotary switch to ensure that availabilities are 
correct.

Kevin,

In my previous e-mail I said the sampling frequency will affect the final 
result when it comes to calculating payment for consumed power.  I have 
modeled the impact of frequency.  This model demonstrates that the frequency 
is significant in the final answer.   Take a look at the column totals for 
each measurement frequency.

In my e-mail I referenced the SCADA system and did not include the sub 
station as it was not my intention to include a reference to the substation.  
I agree that we can integrate the values at the substation to get a total net 
power but this ignores the constraint the utility is introducing, chiefly 
that they want to be paid for consumed power at a different rate than the 
rate they pay for power.

In the model you will find 30 time intervals for measurement.  They can be 
whatever intervals you want.  Then there are measurement frequencies which 
are defined in terms of the intervals.  Since the utility requires that we 
pay for consumed power you can see we may have intervals where we have 
consumed power but don't pay anything because during the same interval we net 
positive power.  Conversely the opposite is also true.

I set this up with random numbers ranging from -25 to 100 to illustrate many 
scenarios.

Regards,
Hollis

Gentlemen,

In considering the solution about the Plant index number recorded in most of 
the Visupro tables I have discovered one issue we will have by not having 
this on the SQL server.  Since the Plant index number records the sequence by 
turbine, we can use this to detect when gaps in the data occur.  In 
particular, in the Errdev we expect a consecutive Plant index number for each 
turbine ID and status message.  

If we push the data to the SQL server and create an auto number, the status 
messages for each turbine will have a sequential auto number, but NOT be 
consecutive.  Using the Plant Index number has become a very useful field in 
analysis of the Errdev data.

We need to store the Plant Index as it is written.

Comments?

Jeff Duff

The request was for 1.5 availability info to verbally give at AWEA to 
prospective clients.  The following 2002 U.S. info is based on Vestas 
Availability, as coordinated with Ilan Caplan, and the European availability 
is based on availability as defined in Europe.  Vestas availability is a 
marketing availability that takes as many credits for "allowable" downtime as 
Vestas did for the V-27 turbines and we assume they take credit for in more 
recent turbines.   The leaning towers at Trent are removed.  The U.S. 
Weighted Avg is averaged over the number of turbines.  Therefore, Trent and 
Desert Sky have a much stronger influence than smaller projects.  None of 
these availabilities are contractual availabilities used for availability 
penalty or incentive payments and are not reported to owners.

Kurt and Jeff:
I have used the data lists, as given, and things went fairly smoothly,

I found several occurances of more than 107 turbines curtailed!  Check
the attached worksheet for one example.  I was able to sort out
duplicates and you can see what I came up with.  Since I have to use a
wind speed calculation when more than 21 turbines are curtailed, I don't
want to just assume that all 107 turbines were curtailed when there may
have been less.
I need someone to go over the numbers again, so we can have more
confidence.

Subject: Primary Index for all messages

Hallo together,

Generating a primary index for messages.

The index in the Errdev on the SQL server is used to see if messages are lost.
 
A useful index should  be the index of the error message of  the PLC.

At the moment the PLC is not generating a error message.
If the PLC error fifo has an overflow the erroe messages are lost.

In VisuPro i want to use an index for every received error message.
This index is initiated with 0 if VisuPro starts
Every time VisuPro receives anerroe message the index number is incremented. 
Every error message send from VisuPro to the ParkPC and SQLServer has this 
index number included.
The index number is saved in the errdev table of the SQL server.
So you have the opportunity to check if you have all error message  VisuPro 
received itself.

So you have in index form 0 to an endvalue and start again at 0 if VisuPro 
restarts.

If you have a gap in the numbers you have lost an message.

Opportunity in the future:
If the PLC supports message counter we can use this as an index number.


Would this be okay to you?

Best regards,

Hi Mark,

The message at 10:47 says the the computer was rebooted at that time.  That 
is about the only way that I know of that this message would be recorded.

When the TrbCurtail Service is started it does not remember what turbines 
were curtailed.  It waits 10-minutes after starting before issuing any 
commands to calculate a 10-minute average.  After the 10 minute startup wait, 
the first command output from this program would have released all turbines 
that were currently curtailed, and curtailed new turbines as needed to keep 
the 10-minute average MW output at the curtailment setpoint.

So at 10:57 any turbines that were curtailed before that time would have been 
released.
The curtailment log file Visupro creates at the turbine should be able to 
verify this if needed
.

Database:

 System
Index Number Date/Time Msg
10843 840006029 6/19/02 10:36 Energy curtailed  -> Turbine curtailed

Subject: Curtail200206.db Question

Joe,

Attached is the Curtail200206.db file. I have a question about a sequence of 
events. For turbine 840006029 on June 19th the turbine is "Energy curtailed" 
(Index = 10843), THEN it has the message "Turbine Com Established" (Index = 
10855). Then there are no other messages (for that turbine) until a "Energy 
curtailed" message (Index = 11134).

Is there anything I can assume about the time between the curtailment 
messages? For example, was the turbine uncurtailed when the com established 
message was recorded? Or are did the turbine become uncurtailed and no 
message was recorded? 

Thanks,
Mark

The maintenance fee for S-Plus that was invoiced September 2001 has not been 
paid.  

Due to our current situation, I assume that only in a crisis would the $1,740 
be paid.  So let me know immediately if you even think you will need to call 
the help desk.   With advance notice, we might be able to get a check to them 
in 48 hours especially if high dollars are involved in your analysis.

Please note that at this time, we have NOT been notified that we do not have 
support.  We will not get an upgrade until payment is received.

I will continue to try and mitigate this situation with Insightful.

Please contact me if you have additional questions or concerns.

Nagwa,

I'm attaching a sample of the output of your request (one turbine, #001). 
Please make sure all the fields you need are here.

The logic I used is as follows

(1) Find the moving average of Power (KW) using a 50 minute (5 record) 
interval.
(2) For all 10-minute records where the moving average is >= 1490 find the 
maximum amb. temp.
(3) Find a record where both conditions are true, high temp/high power. I 
added a marker (=1) for the selected record
(4) Make table +/- 12 hours from the marked record (should have close to 144 
records).

You're right.  I was comparing the output example that I gave you yesterday 
and the previous output, which are the same.

Thanks.

Everyone,

Please let me know if you have a 6 Sigma CD or not.  The company has one for 
everyone but there are no extras so it important that you all have one but 
not two.

Brent - Please pass this along to you folks.

Thanks,
Hollis

This message is for all employees in California and New York:

For all who have submitted their disability ballots, thank you!  

There are still a few of you who have not returned your ballot to elect 
either the State Disability program or the GE Disability program.  Do not 
call HR and ask if you are one who did not submit a ballot.  If you are 
unsure whether or not you submitted a ballot, chances are you did not.

We need your ballot immediately!  This issue is now critical.  Please submit 
by end of business Wednesday, July 10th.

For your convenience, a ballot is attached.

March to discuss short term and long term SCADA objectives.

1)
Please provide me with known issues we need to improve the current VisuPro

2)
Provide me with longer term (next 3 - 5 years) requirements/wish list to 
include in a completely optimized SCADA system.

I'd like input by March 18.

Subject: Re: Nacelle Position Configuration  

Hi Jeff,

The nacelle position is relative to the zero position so any rotation counter 
clockwise is negative ("yaw left") and any rotation clockwise ("yaw right")  
is positive. The point at which unwinding occurs is controlled by two 
parameters- 11.5 and 11.6. If the turbine is not in load operation and number 
of nacelle rotations reaches P11.5 (usually set to 1.8) the cable untwist 
will start. If the turbine is in load operation and the number of nacelle 
rotations reaches P11.6 (usually set to 2) the turbine will untwist. The 
number of rotations that start the untwisting operation is an absolute value 
(the number of either positive or negative revolutions).

This is from the internal software description document published by the 
controls group in Rheine:
1.7.2 Cable Unwinding
>From the azimuth rotating head signals (DI11.1, DI11.2), the cable winding is 
measured, i.e. how often the nacelle has rotated around the tower axis 
relative to the 0o nacelle position (cable not twisted). If the number of 
rotations is reached at a standstill or while spinning P11.5 or otherwise 
P11.6, the automatic wind tracking is blocked, the turbine is braked to the 
spinning state and then the cable unwinding to the left (rotations > 0) or to 
the right (rotations < 0) is carried out for a whole number of rotations. The 
brake and motors are controlled as in 1.7.1. Thereafter, automatic wind 
tracking is reactivated.

Hopefully this answers your question.

Subject: Preliminary results from analysis of Visupro data for 5/17/02 time 
period that Gary Verkleeren asked about

Joe,
See the file Memo0529AEP.  Is there a simple explanation for why the system 
OK counter continued to increment 44.7 hrs when the turbine blades were 
pitched out to 80 degrees?   The turbine was not powered down, put in 
maintenance, put in repair, or faulted off.   I talked to the controller 
people and the attached memo are the only commands other than manual pause 
that will cause this.  They sent me the file I stored as PausingCauses.  Call 
me at 6753 if you need any further info.


Please call me with your thoughts on this & I will finish a writeup for Gary 
Verkleeren.      Our group is working on an improved capability to detect 
periods of long pausing.   However, until the data recovery of Statdat files 
improves this new capability may not be consistently reliable or timely.

We have received a number of calls from folks that do not remember how to 
modify their voicemail greeting.  Follow the steps below to change your 
External and Internal Greetings.

1. Dial-in to check your messages as you normally do by touching the message 
button on your phone or by dialing 823-6799.
2. Once you are logged into your mailbox, touch 8, then 2.  The system will 
tell you to press 1 for your external greeting, or 2 for your internal 
greeting.
3. Press 1 or 2 depending on the greeting you wish to change.  
4. After you have selected the greeting to modify, It's a good idea to listen 
to your voicemail as it currently sounds to prepare you for recording the new 
message.  Press 2 to listen to your current greeting.  
5. Press 76 to delete the old greeting.
6. Press 5 to record the new greeting.  Press the # when you have finished 
recording.  
7. Press 2 to listen to the greeting you have recorded.  If you are satisfied 
with it, hang up.  If you are not satisfied, press 76 to delete it.  Press 5 
to record, # to end, 2 to listen.  Repeat this process until you are 
satisfied with your greeting.

If you have any questions, please call the help desk at x6862.

Ron,

The training department has already provided recommended changes and 
additions to Joe. If you do not have a copy, let me know and we will send 
them to you. I think the number one issue is what do our customers want. If 
we can make VisuPro provide our customers with all of the data they need in a 
user friendly format, we will have an excellent software program. Be sure and 
review the comments that Gary Vercleeren sent to Kevin.

Hi Erik,

I worked on this for a little while last night but I couldn't get a modem 
connection from the Hotel. I hope the timing is OK. The confirmed counters 
are highlighted in green. The counters that need to be corrected are 
highlighted in red. Most of the corrections are due to the fact that the 
fault/status messages that are the result of enabling a "manual" operation 
mode (for example, manual yaw) increment the maintenance counter not the 
"turbine OK" counter. Unfortunately, there are many faults that we could not 
confirm using the turbine simulator. If you have any questions Kim Nguyen is 
the person who did the actual testing. I forwarded the results to Mark 
Fischer and Mark Walker so they could check to see if this is the way we want 
the counters incremented for the given fault conditions but have yet to get 
any feedback. The faults that we could not test should be confirmed by 
looking at the Bachmann software. Hopefully this will occur in the near 
future. For now, this is the best information we have.



-Garth

Ward,

We currently re-running the May figures with the updated wind speed 
correction and will forward the May summary with the Jan and Feb figures from 
Rich.  The question should we update the Mar and April figures using the 
updated wind speed correction, or present those figures as a conservative 
figure.

If we re-run them it will take most of the day, and we may have them for the 
morning meeting.

Please let Kurt know and we'll work on this.  I'll try to call when I arrive 
in TX today.

Kurt, let Mark Fisher know if we need to proceed on this.

Terri,

Do you have a copy of the curtailment numbers that you can send to me, so I
may begin looking over them before our meeting on Tuesday? ?I think this
would allow for more imput from CPS regarding the calculation of these
numbers and future curtailment numbers.

I am having to rebuild files and reload.  I have started this second round of 
data loading.  If all goes well, it will be done in the morning.

Note:  We have no data for Turbine 59.

Summary:

The following Statdat files are being reloaded.
1, 21, 30, 38, 43, 51

About 15% of the Minana files had to be rebuilt and reloaded.  Most had 100% 
recovery.  Turbine 47 had 55% recovery.
2, 25, 29, 31, 34, 37, 38, 43, 47, 51, 61, 75, 82, 89, 91, 107, 118

I will let you know when the reload process is completed.

Statdat files are in Production.
Minana files are in Development under clearsky.  We were going to have 
trouble loading the Minana over the Freeana.  Since time was critical, we 
went into a clean area of Development.

Thanks for your reply Mark.  Your observation is interesting.  I had not 
thought of that.  The y intercept of a linear regression can be easily set to 
zero in excel.  It's one of the "trend line" options.

Have a good weekend,

Philippe

Ilan,

Per your request here is the VA with the leaning towers removed and the 90 
day ramp up also removed.

Discounting the leaning towers, there is a slight variation (generally<.1%) 
between the EA term in this report and the EA term in the reports the owners 
may have seen.  This is because the owner reports are corrected for SCADA 
counter resets while this dataset is not.  We are in the process of 
implementing a fix for this variation which includes storing the validated 
counter data in our database but that will not be complete before the AWEA 
meeting.

If you show this data to owners at AWEA the folks from Trent may object as 
they will consider our availability should include leaning towers.  By the 
same token the sites where we did not negotiate a 90 day ramp up may object 
as our availability should include the turbines from commissioning.

Best Regards,
Hollis

Subject: "Vestas Availability"

Here is the latest version. It only uses periods past the 90 day ramp up and 
removes leaning turbines. I have made one other change to the code. I 
discovered one case where the survey time was over 3000 hours, so I added 
code to remove all cases where the ST was greater than 1.10*Actual Survey. I 
have added a paragraph explaining these qualifiers.

Hello Mark,

Could you please check the attached report. It appears that row 67 and 98 are 
using the same data points to indicate the yaw hours. It seems that these two 
rows are identical.


Thanks,

Mark,
I meant to tell you that the new curtailment software is in place so 
curtailments are recorded in Visupro after the 25'th.  The file is called 
Curtail.DB  We have no way of verifying the accuracy of the files but they 
seem to be right on.

The curtailment log implies that you had no curtailment for the last week of

While I can understand the argument for reducing the amount of storage space 
required for the STARLite database, I want to emphasize that I believe that 
we should mimic what is already being done in the STAR database.  Haven't 
each of the variables been data-typed there already?

Subject: Re: Visupro Data Magnitude and Precision  

Kevin,

I think that perhaps it is simpler than all that. I want to match the 
precision of the data storage to the accuracy of the measurements. Here is an 
example of what I am looking for:

Wind speed (5,2)

In this example,  there are five digits and two are after the decimal (e.g. 
###.##.) This variable could hold a value up to (but not including) 1000 with 
an accuracy of +/- .01. As I recall, wind speed sensors are accurate to one 
decimal place (at best) and it is standard practice to go one decimal beyond 
to prevent rounding error.

As for how the data is stored, I believe that Number(M,N) is stored 
internally as M nibbles and puts the decimal before the last N digits. Thus, 
the value listed above would require less than 3 bytes to store. A standare 
double precision IEEE floating point requires 8 bytes.

As to the issue of the number of variables... I can't be held responsible for 
the conscientious manner in which you SCADA people wish to satisfy the data 
requirements of the company. Seriously, I hope that many of the sensors are 
the same type (e.g. temp sensors) and the values, once determined, can be 
applied to multiple parameters.

I hope this makes the issue clear.

David

Subject: Re: Visupro Data Magnitude and Precision  

David: 

First, I would like to understand how the data will be stored using only 
magatitude and precision values. Precision is pretty much useless without 
knowledge of the actual accuracy of the sensor and the converter. By 
magatitude do you mean the number of bits? This changes depending upon where 
the data is collected. First,  the sensor's are analog so they do not have a 
bit weight. Second, the A/D converter used in the Bachmann controll has a 
limit to its number of bits, but when reported through the "system" may be 
changed to ASCII where the number of bits grows, but not the accuracy! Also, 
many of the items on your list do not have a magnatitue or precision, such as 
Turbine ID. This is not a sensor or an analog signal, although it does have a 
size in bytes. 

The list is extensive and will require a large amount of work to complete. 
Once again I am not comfortable with data reduction that does not include the 
accuracy consideration of the sensor, the A/D converter etc., Precision 
without accuracy is a perfect example. This leads to meaningless numbers. 
Consider a sensor with an overall accuracy of +/- 1%. This sensor may be 
connected to a 16 bit converter with a precision and accuracy of +/- .0015%. 
Therefore we will have a system that can display the sensors 0 to 10 volt 
output down to three decimal places when its actual accuracy is only good to 
one decimal place. The remaining digits are useless. Because we use a PLC, we 
do not tailer the sensor to the system, therefore this type of event happens 
throughout the Bachmann controller. Wind speed readings are a perfect 
example. The anemometer has an overall accuracy of about +/- 2% during high 
wind speeds, and +/- 5% at low wind speeds, yet the anemometer counter is 
capable of accuracies approaching 24 bit, or +/- .000006%. Once again we will 
have lots of digits that are not usable in anyones calculations. 

Perhaps an explanation of how the reduction will work is in order. It would 
be helpful for you to know the actual accuracy of the systems so that we may 
determine how many ditigs are usefull and how many are not. This would be a 
better approach to help limit the amount of data. As an example, wind speed 
storage to more then one or two decimal places is simply a waist of storage. 

Perhaps an explanation of how the reduction will work is in order. Once Garth 
returns from Europe I will ask that he start on this task. 

Looking forward to your comments. 

Regards 

KLC

on Friday March 8, at 1:30 PST to address your questions regarding the
downloading of data from SCADA. Mark and I will contact you in your office
at 3:30CST.

Regarding the defective Eickoff gearbox on WTG #79 at Trent Mesa, today EWC
will ship a replacement Flender gearbox to Trent Mesa from our Tehachapi
location. It is our plan to install this gearbox in place of the defective
Eickoff gearbox and return the turbine to operational status as soon as
possible.

What definition of down time do you mean?   If the GEWE definition,  the time 
when the turbine is faulted off automatically or in a repair status, is used 
then yes your are correct.   If the customer definition, when the turbine 
can't produce power in good winds, then you are incorrect.   The turbine 
can't produce power during manual pause  mode or in transition between 
states.  During calm months, the turbine should  not frequently be in 
transition.   Manual pause should be uncommon as per management direction.

As a verification of understanding;

Total Down Time  = TO - (DT + RT +LOT + MT + EST + WOT)

Where TO = Total possible survey time.

Joe,

Upon my review of the mon files for Mill Run,  I have discovered some 
discrepancies surrounding the recent grid outage on 6-5-02 that require 
corrective action.
The Mill Run site experienced grid downtime on 6-5-02 between 2115 and 2330 
hours for a total of 2 hrs and 15 minutes.  The associated grid downtime that 
was logged by the mon files within Visupro recorded the following:

WTG#1   - 2hrs 20 minutes
WTG#2   - 2hrs 22 minutes
WTG#3   - 2hrs 24 minutes
WTG#4   - 2hrs 26 minutes
WTG#5   - 2hrs 18 minutes
WTG#6   - 4hrs 46 minutes
WTG#7   - 2hrs 12 minutes
WTG#8   - 5hrs 02 minutes
WTG#9   - 2hrs 16 minutes
WTG#10 - 2hrs 22 minutes

The majority of the turbines are within reason except for turbines #6 and #8 
which have recorded more than double the actual grid downtime.  In addition, 
WTG#4 reports no data in the mon file for 6-2-02, Can you explain this 
occurrence?  This is not the first time data has been observed to be missing 
from the mon file of an individual turbine.  I also noted that WTG#5 
experienced more than 10 hours on repair on 6-6-02, Was there a failed 
component that was replaced on this date?

As previously discussed, I want Visupro to be an effective tool for both you 
and me.  We need to work together to work out all of the bugs and reporting 
malfunctions so that we can have a high level of confidence that it is 
performing calculations and reporting accurately.  Please forward my concerns 
to the appropriate people within GE so as to respond to these couple of items 
in a timely manner.  Understanding the mon file discrepancy in particular 
will be useful for the upcoming meeting with GE personnel to work through the 
availability calculations.

Furthermore, please provide me with the field reports for the shaft 
inspections recently performed at Mill Run.  Am I correct in saying that 3 
shafts were tested at Mill Run and none at Somerset?

I look forward to your responses

If we are only talking about a .6% drop in avg. availability, we had better 
be ready to defend our numbers. Not just defend but convince Zilkha why we 
are right with our calcs. Mark F. unless I am mistaken, Gary V. is expecting 
a bigger drop??

Subject: Mill Run report through May with Virtual Mode corrections.

Summary:
The Jan - May 2002 availabilities are revised to exclude virtual mode / pause 
events.   The results showed that every turbine had between one and two hours 
each month where the WTG was transitioning between states as per design.   
Therefore, the resulting total hours of pausing and virtual mode for each 
turbine was decreased by one and a half hours.   In addition the pausing due 
to noise curtailment at turbine 7 between the hours of 7 PM and 5 AM local 
time was excluded.   No other changes were made to the SCADA data.  The net 
result is that the Jan availability dropped by 1.5%, Feb dropped by 0.4%,  
Mar dropped by 0.3%,  Apr dropped by 0.1%.   Dec 2001 data was not corrected 
due becasue the data recovery of the minana files in that month was very 
poor.  The Somerset report  is  well underway and will be in a similar form.

Mark, Mark and Mark: 

I have reviewed the attached power curve and clearly it will not help in 
formulating an answer to your question. 

I would like to ask Mark Fisher to look at a typical installation (any one of 
our field sites) and give us data on kWh consumed by several turbines over a 
multi-month period with data arranged month by month. Perhaps one or two 
turbines at Monfort would be the best because we can look at a whole year of 
data. This would tell us what was produced and what was consumed in energy. 

Mark Eilers, what do you think? 

Regards 

KLC

the gearbox must be left locked down  
the gearbox must be returned to Eickhoff Germany  for repair and 
investigating the cause of damage immediately  
we request answers to our following  questions:

? 

what is the date of commissioning of WTG #  79?  
no. of operating hours at???  nominal load??? and at partial load  
are all teeth of the gearwheel damaged or a  segment only?  
does the pinion show comparable damage ?  
is a bearing damage visible ?  
are deformed components or casing parts visible in  the surroundings of the 
affected gear stage?  
is it possible to get photos of the surface  structure?with higher resolution 
?  
for damage diagnosis we require detailed WTG data  of the last 7 operating 
days, particularly of the last 24 hours before  stop,??i.e. gearbox temp. and 
speeds, power, wind speeds, 
are metallic particles in the filter?  
we need? the torque measurement results?  of the reference gearbox in Trent

Nagwa,

I'm attaching a sample of the output of your request (one turbine, #001). 
Please make sure all the fields you need are here.

The logic I used is as follows

(1) Find the moving average of Power (KW) using a 50 minute (5 record) 
interval.
(2) For all 10-minute records where the moving average is >= 1490 find the 
maximum amb. temp.
(3) Find a record where both conditions are true, high temp/high power. I 
added a marker (=1) for the selected record
(4) Make table +/- 12 hours from the marked record (should have close to 144 
records).

If either the logic or the fields selected need adjustment let me know.

Mark Fisher

I just noticed that I referred to month 5 in some of the dates in 
memo0529AEP.   My apologies.  Below is a corrected version that replaces the 
previous memo0529AEP.

Subject: Preliminary results from analysis of Visupro data for 5/17/02 time 
period that Gary Verkleeren asked about

Joe,
See the file Memo0529AEP.  Is there a simple explanation for why the system 
OK counter continued to increment 44.7 hrs when the turbine blades were 
pitched out to 80 degrees?   The turbine was not powered down, put in 
maintenance, put in repair, or faulted off.   I talked to the controller 
people and the attached memo are the only commands other than manual pause 
that will cause this.  They sent me the file I stored as PausingCauses.  Call 
me at 6753 if you need any further info.


Please call me with your thoughts on this & I will finish a writeup for Gary 
Verkleeren.      Our group is working on an improved capability to detect 
periods of long pausing.   However, until the data recovery of Statdat files 
improves this new capability may not be consistently reliable or timely.

Please see the attached work requests.

Jim - Please verify that these will meet your needs.  Also, please note the

We will know better what is available as we dig into the work.

Hollis,
The numbers should be correct on this also if you have access to visual pro 
Remote in the config. file their are chanxxx.db files whereas x= numbers. 
these have to be opened in desk top database. they have extended listings of 
units and min. /max. values. n-set is probably for the 600A  which also uses 
Visualpro, I will verify for you.

Kurt, 
We changed from the Feb. curtailment format to the new format because 
curtailments are being recorded more accurately now.  Take this example of a 
typical curtailment: CPS requests that we keep each line at 30MW.  With the 
old format, we would enter one line of information that contained all of the 
turbines that were shut down.  This would work IF the same exact turbines 
were shut down for the duration of the curtailment.  This is never the case.  
To maintain a specific output (which is always what CPS requests) we are 
constantly shutting down and starting turbines due to windspeed fluctuation.  
Using the old format, there would be a new line entered every time another 
turbine was shut down or restarted.  This would also imply (inaccurately) 
that all the turbines affected by the curtailment were stopped and started 
each time a new turbine was added.  

With the new format, when we start or stop a turbine we just add another 
line.  This is the better method of the two to accurately record the down 
time, because it is itemized.  If the operators follow the procedure that has 
been given to them, this will be very accurate.  I apologize for the 
confusion over some of the information on the first March Log.  We have gone 
over the procedure again with all onsite personnel so we should not see the 
discrepancies again that we saw in March.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please give me a call.  Also, if 
you give me your fax#, I can fax you an original copy of the curtailment form 
so you can see first hand how the information is recorded.

Thank you
Matt

Subject: Monthly Reports

Hey guys, the attached is the curtailment page from the Feb. Clear Sky 
monthly report. This format is one that I would like to stick with but if it 
not practical to provide the information in this format it is acceptable to 
alter or change it as long as we provide the information in one form or 
another. I am not sure what drove the change in format but we need to decide 
how this information will be provided and stick with it on a consistent 
basis. With the coming changes in the Asset Management group it behooves us 
to standardize each portion of the monthly report. The person responsible for 
compiling the information contained in the report as well as preparing the 
monthly reports is going to change very soon. 

Lets discuss this soon as the March reports are due next week.

Thanks

KA

Mark,

I checked the sums with what was sent on 6/25 using the 10.4% correction.  
They are not the same.  I will inform AEP that we will reprocess these 
figures.  Maybe we can reprocess overnight on my and your machine next week 
rather than wait until the June result.

Mark - 

Thanks for the Monthly Reports.  Do we have the same report for the 1.5s 
through 2001?  Is this the report you referred to last week that was going to 
be revised, and that you only were going back to Jan. 2002 at this point?  If 
that is the case, how should I go about summarizing EA availability, ramp-up, 
etc for 2001?

Thanks again,
Ilan

Mark:

I haven't looked at the latest stuff that you have sent because I've had a 
problem connecting by remote. I'll be in the office on Friday and will be in 
touch with you. Do you intend to provide data from May also? I believe that 
this will be very interesting due to higher ambient temperatures. Please 
advise if that is possible. Thanks.

Hollis,

In your absence, I have decided to appoint Jeff Duff to meet in San Antonio 
with AEP and CPS to go over curtailment calculation.  He will review and 
familiarize himself with the calculation by talking to Mark Fisher.
  
Kurt,

Please get in touch with Jeff and have a preliminary meeting with him and 
Mark Walker, so that there are no surprises at the meeting with CPS.

Best regards,

Jeff

Subject: CPS curtailment meeting


CPS would like to meet with AEP and GE Wind to discuss curtailment 
calculations on June 24th in their offices in San Antonio.  The curtailment 
calcualtions that we have been working on will be the basis of past and 
future billings and therefore need to understand and accepted by all 
parties.   

Rich Simon plans to be available via conference call.  I would like to have a 
representative from GE Wind at the meeting if possible to answer any 
questions concerning their curtailment calculation methodology which we are 
proposing for May onward.  We will also discuss the modified method for 
handling Jan thru April curtailment estimates that Rich Simon has been 
working on to account for the missing SCADA data in the prior months 
beginning on January 11th.

Afternoon All,

NEW PIAs

I know many of you have been very anxious to get your arms around a new GE 
confidentiality agreement.  I am attaching the following:

1.  Mutual Nondisclosure Agreement.  This is to be used with clients for 
potential transactions and for the exchange of information where the third 
party will not be designing a product and where we do not expect to own that 
design.

2.  Proprietary Rights and Nondisclosure Agreement.  This is to be used with 
engineers and vendors where they will be producing product for us that we 
consider to be GE Wind work product.  For example, if we engage an engineer 
to design something for us where we expect to own that design.

FILLING THEM OUT

It is very important that the PIAs be properly completed.  For the most part 
that just means filling in the third parties name in the first paragraph and 
in the signature block.  However, there is one important variation with the 
Mutual Nondisclosure Agreement, you are required to fill in a description of 
the transaction that you are working on with the third party. 

Examples:

manufacture and procurement of main shafts
sale of GE wind turbines to the Company
general development opportunities with the Company using GE wind turbines
sale of GE wind turbines to the Company for XYZ Project

IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES FROM EWC'S FORM

Please keep in mind that the GE form requires you to follow up with a written 
letter as to any verbal conversation you had with someone where you discussed 
confidential information or you took someone on a visual site tour.  So if 
you discuss something about our turbines that if put in writing we would 
consider confidential, you must send a quick letter following up that 
conversation and notifying them that the information is subject to this 
agreement.  Also, if you take someone on a site tour where they are privy to 
confidential information, you must follow up with a letter.   I will come up 
with a basic letter that you can keep and fill in the blanks and send out 
whenever the situation arises.  Please keep in mind that these agreements are 
only as good as the documentation that backs them so be diligent in your 
efforts.  

LEGAL REVIEW OF PIAs/ GETTING YOUR PIA SIGNED

If you do not make any changes to the text of the PIA, you do not need to 
seek legal review prior to having it signed by GE Wind Energy LLC.  GE Wind 
is still working on signing authority and we should have further clarity 
soon.  Until then, all persons who were vice-presidents of EWC are able to 
sign PIAs.  Of course, Colleen Repplier can also sign.  For your convenience, 
here are a list of the most likely signatories in the U.S.:

Bob Gates
Michael Miller
Bob Rugh
Craig Christenson
Michael Westbeld
Ben Bell
Jeff Maurer

WHAT TO DO WITH YOUR SIGNED PIAs

1.  Please send a signed copy to Maya Arthur who will scan the PIA onto the 
system and maintain a data bank of PIAs that everyone can access.   This will 
avoid the situation where we don't know if a customer or vendor has signed 
one yet or not.  I believe once we have acess to the GE network, we can post 
these directly on the system.

2.  Send the original to legal.

WHAT ABOUT THE PIAs SIGNED WITH EWC

We did our best to find and assign all PIAs that were signed with EWC.  
However, many are old and frankly, it just makes sense going forward to sign 
up new PIAs.  This avoids a situation where you are banking on a previously 
signed PIA that fell threw the cracks and wasn't assigned.  I would recommend 
that you starting signing up new PIAs as you go.

QUESTIONS

Give me a call.  V.

Hollis,

we don't have your wished calculation. I summarized the counter data for the 
European 1.5 fleet by month for the year 2001 and the Dec.1999.
The countervalues in the enclosed EXCEL-File are absolutvalues of the PLC. 
The difference between the absolutvalues are values for months.

We had only 3 counters to calculate availability of our 1.5 WTGs in 2001:
Operational Time
System Ok Time
Down Time

I hope I was able to help you.

Best Regards,
Klaus

		 Thema: Summarized Counter Values
Ruth,

We have had a request from our commercial group for turbine availability 
numbers with the availability as defined by Vestas.  The purpose of this is 
to present a chart with the Vestas availability definition applied on our 
turbines during the AWEA conference in two weeks.

Do you have the ability to calculate availability of our 1.5 WTGs in Europe 
using the Vestas definition of availability?  If so would you provide this 
information for the 1.5 WTGs during the year 2001?

The Vestas definition of availability is :  (Hours of Wind Turbine in 
Operation mode / Hours of Grid in Operation Mode) * 100%.

If you do not have this calculation do you have summarized counter data for 
the European 1.5 fleet by month for the year 2001?  This is not a request for 
the individual VisuPro files but rather some sort of consolidated data 
(Excel, Access, etc) which shows each counter value for each turbine for the 
month.  If you have this data then I think we could produce a Vestas 
availability number to use in AWEA.

I know this is a big request so I thank-you in advance!

Best Regards,
Hollis

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Many of you have received the Six Sigma Green Belt Training CD.  If you have 
not, contact your supervisor or Jeri Fish to obtain a copy.
All salaried GE Wind Energy employees are required to qualify as a "Green 
Belt", and others are invited to participate in this program as well. It is 
my understanding that we each will be required to perform one Six Sigma 
project during our first year as GE Wind Energy employees.  We will be 
measured to some extent by our Six Sigma project participation and successful 
implementation of the methods presented in the CD-ROM.  Annual performance 
evaluation, advancement in the organization, and salary level are all 
influenced by our Six Sigma related performance.    

You recently heard Nicoa Dunne announce that GE Wind Energy had accomplished 
the integration process in shorter time than any other GE acquisition.  Our 
leadership group is proud of that achievement and has raised the bar by 
putting out the challenge to have all GE Wind Energy salaried personnel 
become Green belts in a shorter time than any other GE business unit.  I am 
asking you to do your part as a member of the Services team by successfully 
completing the study requirements and tests given in the CD for Green Belt 
qualification before July 15, 2002.  You may use time during work to study 
the material and take the test.  

Please see me to pick up your personal copy of the CD-ROM so that you can get 
started.  Following your completion of the CDROM study requirements, there 
will be a 3-day Green Belt 6-Sigma Training class for all parties that have 
participated.

Rich Simon needs the following data: 

10 or 15 minute average wind speed, wind direction from Met Tower 652 and if 
it is still standing from the 10 meter tower 653. ? 
10 or 15 minute energy production for each turbine 
Which turbines were curtailed and when and how long they were curtailed 

Let me know if and how long it will take to gather this data.

Mark: 

First, the new version of VisuPro (Version IV) will use standard local time, 
not daylight time. This means that during the year it will be off by one hour 
for 1/2 of the year. 

Second, the plant pc cannot have more then one version and copy of VisuPro 
running at one time. If it does then strange things happen. I will ask our 
SCADA people to make sure that Joe does not run more then one copy of VisuPro 
on any plant pc. 

Regards

Subject: Questions/Observations about VisuPro

Ron,

While I was at Mill Run/Somerset last week a few things came up about 
visupro. 

First a question about the new version. As I understand it, the new version 
is going to use "local time". Is this local STANDARD time or local time 
(taking Daylight Savings time into account)? The owner's representative 
indicated a preference for local standard time.

Now for a couple of things Joe Thorpe at the site mentioned. He has observed 
that if two copies of visupro are running at the plant, then 10-minute data 
does not get written. Second if visupro (at the plant) has the errdev file 
open, then new data does not get written to the file. Are you aware of these 
observations? If not you might want to contact Joe Thorpe and see if he has 
additional examples, and do some kind of testing. These are probably issues 
with the way that Paradox locks files.

Mark Fisher

Joe Chapman sent us an email listing a short textual description associated 
with each value of Operating State 29.  Some are easy to interpret (ex. 11 is 
"Feathering position") because they are a visible element on the state 
transition diagram in the controller document supplied by Garth.  Others 
aren't easy to interpret.   Where should we look to understand the triggering 
criteria for text strings associated with Operating states 0-6 and 13.   We 
are willing to do the work of reading the documentation if you can tell us 
what to read.  These values are labeled "Blade angle setpoint (all blades)",  
" Blade angle plus", "Blade angle minus",  "Blade angle stop", " Blade angle 
setpoint (single blades)", and "Manual speed setting".    I assume from these 
names and the fact that they are not common in the SCADA data that all but 
Blade angle stop are solely used for controller parameter changes or software 
changes.   We want to use Operating State 29 in our Statistical Process 
Control and reporting logic but the lack of understanding on these parameter 
values holds us back.

Hi Rabi,

I am developing a StatServer Analytic, but it keeps timing out (at about 300 
seconds/5 minutes). In the page I am using I have tried increasing the time 
but it has no effect, so could you find out if there is a setting on the 
server (IIS script timeout) and see about increasing the value?

Ben, confirming our conversation earlier today regarding the two items below, 

Mark Fisher, a Data Analyst in our Information Services group is available on 
Friday March 8, at 1:30 PST to address your questions regarding the 
downloading of data from SCADA. Mark and I will contact you in your office at 
3:30CST.

Regarding the defective Eickoff gearbox on WTG #79 at Trent Mesa, today EWC 
will ship a replacement Flender gearbox to Trent Mesa from our Tehachapi 
location. It is our plan to install this gearbox in place of the defective 
Eickoff gearbox and return the turbine to operational status as soon as 
possible.

Hi Mark,

Thanks for the analyses and the rapid turnaround.  It's great working with 
you.

Attached is your spreasheet with a couple of summary plots that you might 
find interesting.  I have included the previous results you generated for the 
case where no filtering on wind direction was done.

The results indicate to me that the additional filtering of the data is 
overall improving the accuracy of the free-stream wind speed estimation 
(based on the mean nacelle wind speed and mean wind speed ratio), but at the 
cost of larger standard error because of the reduction in number of samples.  
Therefore, it seems that additional filtering might not be so valuable 
afterall.

Any comments?

Philippe

Attached please find a new Statistical Process Control analytic which 
displays the turbine performance for your site.  The report pdf is a summary 
of the other two reports and delineates which turbines fall outside the 2 
sigma line for each category.  The other two reports provide more detail 
regarding the turbine performance including the degree to which a turbine 
falls outside the 2 sigma line.

Please note that we are still working with the analytic and you will find 
some extraneous characters in the results.  Please add these characters in 
with the main group for which they are intended.  We will have them removed 
from the code next month.

Best Regards,
Hollis

Dear Michael,

We, too, enjoyed the opportunity to meet with you last Thursday and 
appreciate the candid feedback you and Michael were able to give us regarding 
the PA projects.  We are currently investigating your and Mr. Winsor's issues 
regarding availability, noise, blades, electronic faults, and cold weather 
faults.  I suggest we schedule a conference call with our Operations team and 
Mr. Winsor this week to clarify and resolve any issues you may have.  We 
appreciate your business, and look forward to serving you better in the

I wanted to thank all three of you for coming to meet with us this morning. 
It is very exciting to have GE in this business. I am forwarding the 
following e-mail since I thought you would want to know what the feelings 
currently are in the trenches at Zilkha in terms of the PA projects. The 
projects were commissioned six months ago so I can understand the frustration.

We look forward to seeing you at AWEA and to a long and fruitful relationship.

With best wishes,

Michael

Kurt,

I have a few questions relating to the Monthly Reports prepared for the Mill 
Run and Somerset Wind Farms.  They are as follows:

* On April 5th the Main Circuit Breaker located within the pad mounted 
transformer on WTG#7 at Mill Run was torn apart and replaced by Marvin Blanco 
(GE Turbine Tech.).  In addition, on or about this same date IGBT's were 
replaced within the same turbine.  Nowhere in the Monthly report are these 
issues mentioned, please explain?

* WTG#9 at Mill Run experienced downtime between 4-17-02 at 10:00 A.M. and 
4-24-02 at 4:00 P.M. this equates to 7 days - 6 hrs. or 7.25 days.  Assuming 
WTG#7 operated fault free the entire month (its availability at 100%) except 
for the above mentioned period of 7.25 days, the best possible availability 
that could be realized would be            (1-(7.25/30) x 100) = 75.8%.  
Please explain how the availability of this turbine can be 78.6% as listed in 
the Monthly Report?

* On 4-25-02 WTG#8 experienced several hours of repair time due to worn HV 
cable which had been rubbing against the ladder rungs at the yaw deck level.  
Apparently, the bundle of cables sways or moves during normal operation and 
over an extended period it caused significant wear to the protective 
coating/insulation.  Why was this not mentioned?  Are other turbines 
experiencing this problem?  Is there a retrofit being considered?

* On 4-28-02 a storm event with heavy winds rolled through the area.  
Turbines #2, #3, and #8 at Mill Run all experienced faults requiring 
component replacements.  The Summary on individual turbine activity in the 
monthly report does not reflect this, neither does the Consumption Log also 
contained within the Monthly Report, please explain?  In fact, WTG#8 required 
a new rack of IGBT's as a result of this storm event and no mention is made 
in the report to an IGBT replacement for this turbine.  Furthermore, on 
4-30-02 a new rack of IGBT's was installed in WTG#8 and they were blown upon 
start up.  IGBT's are major components, As a minimum I would expect the 
monthly reports to include major component failures/replacements.

* I need clarification on what exactly Section 7. EXHIBITS is attempting to 
demonstrate.  Surely, this is not an attempt to list all faults that a 
turbine experienced for the current month.  How are you selecting the faults 
you choose to include on the list?  For example, WTG#4 lists one (1) fault 
for the month and clearly that was not the case.  As one example, check the 
operational activity for WTG#4 on 4-22-02 where it experienced multiple 
faults among them "Gearbox Oil Pressure Too Low."

We have to have a better account of the operational history of these wind 
farms through GE Wind Monthly Reports.  I understand that the company as a 
whole has been consumed with many other tasks relating to the recent 
acquisition and that your attention has been elsewhere.  Nevertheless, we 
need to work together in order to improve the accuracy and attention to 
important details that is lacking within these reports.

I look forward to working with you and Joe to make these projects better and 
more accountable.

Best Regards,

Gary

seems to be some confusion as to what our action items are in resolving the

Executive Summary

The attached file, Clearskypavout0302,  contains the production and 
availability data based on Visupro recorded data.   The turbine production in 
March and Jan are within 0.3% of the substation value assuming a 2% line 
loss.   February is still lower than the substation after all of the 
corrections used in March and January were applied.    The turbines which had 
a meter reset in March were 17, 44, 59, and 93.    The meter resets were 
corrected for.   Also corrected were turbines 32 and 42 which had a 
communication loss at the beginning of March and turbines 69, 70, 71, 77, 82 
- 93, 96, 100, 102, 103, 104-109, and 113-122 which had a communication loss 
at the end of March.  A final correction was made to turbine 42 which had an 
improper Visupro address during the early part of March.  
The availability rose above 90% even though the production was disappointing 
due to frequent curtailments.  There were no corrections for force majeure 
because no force majeure was indicated in the Daily Reports.  The grid outage 
log information was added to the attached file for cross reference.   If any 
further information is required then please call Mark Walker at 661 
823-6753.   An excel file is provided instead of a PDF file as per Asset 
Management request.

Subject: Trent Mesa Report Elements from Oct 2001 to Dec 2001

Executive Summary
The following report incorporates the monthly meter readings by the site 
personnel & review of the mon files from Visupro.   In all three months the 
project availability ramp up was not attained although the Dec availability 
is close.   It should be noted that the Oct 2001 grid availability was 
extremely poor and that erratic grid conditions are known to cause turbine 
trips associated with grid variations.   This should be less of a problem due 
to the DVAR  but the problem may not be eliminated entirely.   In November 
2001 the Visupro data recovery was only about 85% and it is possible that 
there was higher availability but there is no recorded data to prove it.   In 
contrast the data recovery was over 94% in Dec 2001.

It was brought to our attention that there was confusion downloading the wind 
data using the new Download tool deployed by the SCADA team.  To ensure we do 
not loose any data, please continue to download the weekly data according to 
SUB 352_C until the instructions using the new tool have been resolved.  

You can download the data using the new tool in addition and send in both 
sets of data.  We will send out clearer instructions the week of the 7th at 
which time we will update the SUB 352_C to include the use of the Download 
tool.

Any questions pleas call

Splus 2000 r3.

I have fit a 2-parameter Weibull distribution to a data vector (fire-free
intervals in forests) and would like to compute the probability that the
shape parameter is greater than 1.  I can use bootstrap() [I presume] to
compute the standard error.  Is there a closed expression for CIs? (I
imagine a normal approximation would be pretty lame here).

Thanks in advance for any suggestions.

Mike,

Are these the turbines which are on line are producing as of the date of this 
report?  In other words should our MOOP report total to these numbers for 
these sites with respect to turbine count?

Thanks,
Hollis

Jeff,

I didn't have time to go through all of this to answer your specific question 
about air pressure. I think VisuPro does display in mbars but like I said the 
raw data from the ZMET is a count (0-4095) which corresponds to the range of 
the meter (1-6V is 0 psia to 15 psia). The conversions (transfer functions) 
are on page 3,4 and 8 of the ZMET software description:



Here are the data sheets for the instruments:



Hope this helps...

Due to the fact that we have 63 Gigabytes of mail on our Notes server that 
has to be converted to Outlook, we must start the conversion process 
immediately in order to ensure that you have access to your old Lotus Notes 
e-mail when you come in on Monday.  What does this mean to you?

1. Currently, when you send e-mail from your Lotus Notes account, it includes 
a "reply to" heading that indicates your e-mail address is 
firstname.lastname@ps.ge.com.  When folks hit the reply button, it 
automatically puts your @ps.ge.com address in the "To" field.  When this 
e-mail hits the GE server, it is forwarded to your old @enron.com address, 
which is why it is still delivered to your Notes mailbox.  

2. When we start the conversion, we have to stop forwarding to the @enron.com 
address.  This means that any mail addressed to your @ps.ge.com address will 
stop at GE.  You will be able to see these messages on Monday in your Outlook 
mailbox when you come in.  Any mail addressed to the old @enron.com address 
will show up in your Lotus Notes mailbox for the remainder of this week.  
However, any mail that comes in addressed to your @enron.com address after 
your particular mailfile has been converted, will not show up in your Outlook 
mailbox on Monday.  There is no way to tell you exactly when your particular 
mailfile will be converted.  The program will convert 1 GB per hour, and goes 
in alphabetical order.

In short, you may lose a few e-mails during the transition process, based on 
the timing of your mailfile conversion.  I would suggest that you ask your 
critical contacts to send any e-mail to both the @ps.ge.com and the 
@enron.com addresses for the remainder of the week.  This will provide the 
best assurance that you will not miss any critical messages.

Conversion will begin at 12:00 noon today.

Thanks for your cooperation and understanding.

Mark,
Terrie mails the download CD's weekly and the Curtail.DB file is downloaded 
three days a week as part of the SCADA backup.  The four most recent 
downloads are on the way there today.  If neccessary, I can email the curtail 
files but it would be very time consuming.  Let me know if you need me to do 
this.

I meant to tell you that the new curtailment software is in place so 
curtailments are recorded in Visupro after the 25'th.  The file is called 
Curtail.DB  We have no way of verifying the accuracy of the files but they 
seem to be right on.

The curtailment log implies that you had no curtailment for the last week of

Guys: 

Attached are the meter readings for Indian Mesa for both feeders 
(transformers). They includ the production and the cumsumption, and cover a 
period between May 19 and June 10. 

I think this is the best way to determine the actual consumption, because 
these are the meters that the customer gets paid on and is charged for.

I will be anxious to know if the data in the table meets your needs.

Hi Mark,
I checked the production graphs for the SCADA ATP at trent, and I can see 
couple of turbines missing, turbine no. 73 & 98, I understand that I 
downloaded the data from the wrong turbine for 98 but I don't know what is 
wrong with turbine 73. I checked the data in the minana.db and statdat.db 
files, for turbine 73 couple of times and I believe that all the data is 
there, I am attaching these files again so you can check them once more.
As for turbine 98, I apologize for the silly mistake of downloading the files 
from the wrong turbine, please find attached the files which I downloaded 
this morning, all the 144 records for the 10-min average still exist in the 
minana.db file.
Regards,
Alaadin

One additional VisuPro item that we must know is under what circumstances 
each of the production & availability counters are being used. Also, we must

The MON data for MILL RUN,SOMERSET,KLONDIKE has already loaded into 
development database.
The data has been loaded for indian mesa 2 for Jan_Feb directory.How ever 
some turbines have less data because they do not having full month data.The 
total number of records are 2770.

The MON files of feb 2002 for MONFORT has been loaded.Total number of records 
are 558.

Please look at the data and let me know if any problems are there.

Additional information:   For the next week the 1.5 project priorities for 
the System Performance Group are:
1)  Load up most recent  Mon files for April at site indicated in attached 
spreadsheet.
2)  Load backlogged minana and statdat files for Clear Sky and Trent in order 
to close gaps.   A customer wants us to conduct an analysis in the near 
future with this data.   Mark Fisher says that he gave you graphs which 
highlights gaps in the STAR 10 min data.   Is that adequate?
3)  All other data.

Hi Mark,

As per our discussion, I need linear regression results (equation and R2), 
and I'm interested in these two cases:
1) No binning of the data
2) Binning of the data using 0.5 m/s bins as done previously, in which case 
the linear correlation I need is that on the bin average for the nacelle 
(free-stream) and nacelle wind speeds

As a starting point, please use the spreadsheet on the transfer directory: 
Philippe_G/For_MarkFisher

If at all possible, results before 4pm today would be great.  Sorry for the 
last minute notice.

Philippe

Greetings Everyone --

You may have noticed that your paycheck stubs reflect vacation and sick leave 
balances that are inaccurate.  Due to EWC being acquired mid calendar year, 
and GE "grandfathering" in our vacation levels, the balances as stated on 
your check stub will differ from your actual balances.  So, for the balance 
of this calendar year (2002), all vacation and sick time balances will be 
tracked locally on our own HRIS System (at GE Wind in Tehachapi).  

Human Resources will provide you with your true balances by the following 
method:

The first of every month Human Resources will print out a hard copy of your 
vacation and sick leave balances.
Employees located in the North and South Tehachapi facilities will be able to 
pick up a hard copy of their balances from their respective facility 
receptionists.
Remote site employees' balances will be mailed to the respective Site 
Supervisors for distribution.

Thank you for your continued understanding through the integration process.

Please fill out the attached form to ensure that all applications required by 
you are installed on your machine when it is coreloaded with GE software.  
Note that some of these applications will require that you leave the software 
for IT at your workstation the evening or weekend that your machine is 
scheduled to be loaded.  These applications are underlined on the list.  If 
the software is not left for us, we can not load it, due to software 
licensing issues.  Additionally, there are a few specialty applications that 
you will be expected to load on your own.  These applications are italicized 
on the list.  We do, however, request that you check the box next to them as 
we need to keep track of licensing.

Please submit one copy of the completed form to Leonard Ruiz via interoffice 
mail.  Please tape a copy of the completed form to the side of your computer 
monitor.  This is necessary as the machine name does not always match the 
user name.

An installation schedule will be distributed shortly.  We must have this form 
before we load your PC.  

I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that any data that you 
leave on your local hard drive will be erased when we coreload your machine.  
Don't forget to move all data you wish to save up to the network.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Could you please analyze the data the transfer server in in the directory 
Phillip_G/For_MarkFisher.  You have done the same type of analysis before and 
I have added an example of the output you provided before in the spreadsheet.

All I need is the mean value for the nacelle wind speed, free-stream wind 
speed, and ratio of these two wind speeds for 0.5 m/s bins.

It would be great to get this by 11am tomorrow.

Thanks for your help,

This file contains a summary of the weekly mechanical availability numbers, 
as well as, the contractual availability number received from Asset Mgmt 
(Barry Riffe). It seems that in many cases, the contractual is lower than the 
mechanical.  

In this set of attached data, I am trying to state the monthly domestic fleet 
availability by category (e.g. ramp-up month 1 and warranted month 1, etc).  
As the availabilty numbers are difficult to predict without having it done 
individually by turbine, I am currently taking the document you provided 
(Hollis) and will recalc what is in the attached chart, thus being more 
accurate.  However, the doc. you provided (commissioning summary) only has 
Nov-Feb.  Do we have the data prior to Nov available?  If there is a better 
method, please let me know.

Thanks,
Ilan

Hi Mark,

(1) yes, metmast are to be configured like you thought (Met[metId#] (WTG#)
(2) yes, I incorporated that adjustment for all monthly db files. 

Attached are sample data of each download

Subject: Re: Autodownload tool  

Kim,

This looks pretty good, and will certainly be helpful to the people at the 
site trying to do the downloads. Just a couple of points:

(1) From this I don't understand how metmasts are to be configured. So maybe 
some clarification of that would be good. (Is it Met[met#] (WTG#) ?)

(2) For the Monyymm.db files, we need to get both the current month and the 
previous month (at least for the 1st week of the month), I can't tell if this 
software is doing that.

This looks like this should provide a big help in downloading data. Do you 
have a sample that you can send so we can compare to what our oracle upload 
script is expecting? (Just to be sure.)

Hope my comments are helpful.

Mark

Subject: Re: Autodownload tool  

Kim,

First, Hollis will be out of the office until further notice.  I'll be 
coordinating his tasks for the time being.  Since I don't have the full back 
ground on this development here are my thoughts.

I agree we should work towards the best solution for the task.  It may be 
that the version you are testing is that solution.  The immediate problem we 
are trying to solve is;

1) the sites spend too much time downloading these files
2) we need data consistently and frequently here in Tehachapi, system 
performance team,
3) the sooner we have a solution the more time we will save.

A quick review of the REC document indicates some type of download cycle in 
addition to file format, which would be useful for other reasons.  The on 
site servers are not set up to store real-time data currently, nor is the SQL 
transfer program currently designed to accommodate all of the various files 
listed in either solution.

Last thing, would it be possible for you to send me test data so we can test 
out upload to our STAR db.  There shouldn't be an issue, but this would 
complete a 360 test.

Hi Hollis,

It seems that REC- SCADA is working on the same task as I am, though the 
actual coding has yet begun.  I have coded and now testing at Klondike a 
simplified version of this task (spec. attached).    But before I start to 
modify the code for version 2, perhaps we and REC project leader of this tool 
should come together to derive an optimal decision for this task. What are 
your thoughts?

2) the contractual availability (soft-copy)
3) the machine availability (soft-copy)

Ilan,

Mark Walker will send a request to Germany for their availability data.  Mark 
will also provide the definitions of Machine availability.  The contractual 
availability is what was included in the memo I handed you when you were in 
my office on Wednesday.  If you need an electronic copy of that  document 
Mark can send it to you.

With respect to making us responsible (as the coordinator) for obtaining the 
Germany availability data:  We have no leverage over our European 
counterparts and cannot compel them to provide this data on a 1 day notice.  
I want to avoid setting expectations that are clearly beyond our control.  We 
will, however, give it a shot. 

I did notice the European data stops in Sep 01 so we need 6 months to fill in 
all the gaps.  Has Becky been unable to obtain any more recent data or is 
this the most current info you have?

Thanks,
Hollis

In investigating an apparent error with the pressure sensors at Montfort I 
have discovered two things.

1. Pressure reading are stored in the paradox files in milibars.
2. The pressure sensor at Montfort has been malfunction since it was 
installed, but not replaced pending someone signing a P.O. for the 
replacement sensor.

Mark, NWP was under the impression that adding the hours would improve the 
MAA calculation, and you are saying that it lowered the availability. NWP was 
really more concerned with the reasoning behind the note. NWP also asked for 
a written explanation of the current method of calculation. I will make sure 
that any faults that are not normally associated with weather, but are 
related to a weather  event  will be noted on our monthly report. Thanks.

Subject: Re: OH Reference on February Monthly Report  

The 3.8 hours was added to the January and not Febuary OH term for WTG 11.   
The 3.8 hours was added back because the Emergency Oil Loss was interpreted 
by me to be a failure not directly due to the icing.  Icing alone shouldn't 
cause an emergency oil loss.  I Added it back in to prevent double counting 
of the turbine offlline.  If  the oil loss indication was directly due to 
icing then we should lower the MAA availability for turbine 11 in January to 
correct for 3.8 hours.   Let me know what you want us to do.  

For the future, we analysts will always assume that a failure that occurs 
during icing and that isn't reasonably due to icing alone will be treated as 
a separate (independent) failure.   Please  indicate clearly in the manual 
log that a turbine failure (or apparent failure) was directly related to 
icing or other cause if the failure  isn't obviously expected due to icing 
alone.  Breakage of anemometer cups is an example of a failure that would 
clearly be expected as a result of icing alone.

Mark, you stated 3.8 hours was added to the OH hours of turbine #11 at the 
bottom of the OH calculations sheet. I believe this was added because the 
Emergency Oil Level Fault was not reset on that machine because of the icing 
conditions we were experiencing at the time. Is this correct?

Joe,

Attached is the Curtail200206.db file. I have a question about a sequence of 
events. For turbine 840006029 on June 19th the turbine is "Energy curtailed" 
(Index = 10843), THEN it has the message "Turbine Com Established" (Index = 
10855). Then there are no other messages (for that turbine) until a "Energy 
curtailed" message (Index = 11134).

Is there anything I can assume about the time between the curtailment 
messages? For example, was the turbine uncurtailed when the com established 
message was recorded? Or are did the turbine become uncurtailed and no 
message was recorded? 

Thanks,
Mark

Second attempt...includes a correction in the line loss.  

My observation is that if curtailment was higher, say 3 or 4 extra GWh, then 
the expected would match the observed.

PLease let me know your thoughts today.

Greetings Mark,

Please add these four files to your finished deliverable for work request 574.

Indian Mesa (Clear Sky) met data for towers 0652 & 0653 are attached.  Rich 
usually likes working with the raw data files.  Since the February files 
start on 2/2, the January files (ending on 2/2) are included.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you very much Hollis. I apologize for the mistake on the form. I have 
not spoken to the owner, not for lack of trying I might add.  I think we 
should move forward using hourly data. If this is unacceptable and will 
result in a lot of work for what could be of little value than proceed as you 
see fit. I will continue to attempt to reach the owner to obtain guidance on 
this issue.

Again, I appreciate your support on this task.

Kurt - I changed the date to correct the typo.  It now reads 2/1/02 through 
2/28/02 versus the previous 2/1/02 through 2/1/02 date.  I also changed the 
wind requirement to read "average" wind speed dropping the 10 minute data 
requirement.  The second issue is still outstanding with regard to being 
acceptable.  Can  Rich use hourly data or not?  An alternative would be to 
provide nacelle mounted anemometer data for each turbine on a  10 minute 
basis - would that be helpful?

Hollis

Subject: Desert Sky Curtailment April 2002

Kurt,
I have attached the April Log with some corrections to the curtailments.  The 
lines I shaded blue are typing errors that I fixed.  These will account for 
the negative hours and the turbines with no data. 

 The turbines that are showing hours but no production must be a result of a 
SCADA data acquisition problem.  These entries I shaded in red.  I started 
looking through the list in the April Log but I could not find any errors on 
our side, so you may have to base the lost production on what a particular 
turbines' neighbor produced or lost.  

Call me if you have any questions.

Please take a look at this as soon as possible this morning. It appears that 
you may have some entries where the operator used the 12 hour clock instead 
of th 24 hour clock. There are many rows where a turbine is curtailed but the 
way the time is recorded makes it come out with zero production. Call me if 
you need help.

Kurt,

I'm attaching the generated spreadsheet. There are a few problems. Scanning 
through it it appears the site personnel entered some times backwards so 
there were a few negative durations with 0 kWh predicted productions. I also 
do not know what is causing the other 0 kWh productions (it might be low 
wind, or there might be some other problem).

There was a 90.9% data recovery. The predicted production for the month was 
45929604 kWh, the production lost due to curtailment was 21780739 kWh which 
after 97% availability and 2% line loss becomes 20704770 kWh.

Due to the many curtailments at the site this program takes a lot of time 
(today it ran for 2 hours). 

Mark

Support at Insightful about some erratic or erroneous behaviour in timeDate 
data.   One problem which limits what timeseries plots for Owner reporting we 
can do is supposedly solved in the new 6.1 version of SPLUS that is shipping 
this week or next.   Mark Fisher, Jeff, and I have all encountered 
aggravating problems with time series data that may partly go away in the new

Hi Paul,

Sorry I didn=01,t get back to you after you called on Friday. I went over t=

Bachmann code over the weekend (and, today, confirmed the timer behavior wi=
th=20
Gert). If the turbine is in "maintenance" for any reason such as the physic=
al=20
maintenance switch is on or any manual mode is active due to:

1. Hydraulic service switch on (status 47)
2. Rotor lock engaged (status 108)
3. Generator fan service switch on (status 148)
4. Axle box maintenance switch on- battery power disconnected from pitch=20
motors (status 164)
5. Hub control box switch is in manual position (status 165)
6. Release brake button in the top-box is activated (status 171)
7. Manual pitch setting is active (status 185)
8. Manual generator speed setting is commanded (status 186)
9. Manual torque setting is commanded (status 187)
10. Manual disconnection from the power grid (status 188)
11. Manual yaw operation is commanded (status 189)
12. Manual generator fan operation is commanded (status 191)

then the maintenance timer will increment. If the manual repair switch is s=

while the maintenance mode is active then the repair timer will increment=
=20
(and the maintenance timer will stop incrementing). This should answer Mark=

Walkers concern that the maintenance/repair switch will always take=20
precedence over any manual mode command.

Also note that there should be a correction to the list that Erik was=20

.=20
Fault 165 increments "maintenance time" not "system OK" time.

The attached file shows the Manual Log Data (in red) that is overdue and 
required to complete Owner Reports.  The SCADA data is still under review.  
It will be added to this report when the data is avialable .  Only two of the

Jeff,

Mar - May 2002 have been recalculated and spreadsheets created. Mar & Apr 
wend down slightly due to the "extra" turbines. May has gone up, possibly due 
to some data filling in holes from before, data recovery does appear to be 
better this time. The spreadsheets are sorted and totaled by Bus.ID. The 
"extras" are at the bottom with 0 production.

Ilan,

Here is our first attempt at a "Vestas Availability" calculation.  We did 
this for the US 1.5 fleet for each month in the year 2002.

There are some things you should be aware of in this calculation:

1.  The Trent leaning towers are not excluded in these numbers.  We are 
working on excluding these towers but that is complicated so we won't have it 
completed today but you can expect it tomorrow.
2.  The Vestas availability number includes a portion of the repair time in 
"operational" time while the remainder is not included in the operational 
time.  We tried to emulate that by inserting a factor along with the VisuPro 
RT term.  This factor is very soft and can be changed although currently we 
have it set as .5.

Please take a look at the results and let me know if you have any questions 
or comments.

Thanks,
Hollis

Almost always VA>EA (though not always). I have not put in any kind of note

Kurt, 
You asked for the availability of Clear Sky by 11 am.   The attached file 
provides this and will form the final Onwer Report when the Manual Logs are 
fully integrated into the file.   The production is 10% lower than the 
substation meter reading.  I have applied all of the corrections I can 
through Visupro data.   

George,
Are the manual reads you sent in based on Visupro screen data?  Or readings 
from the controller interface at the turbine?

Kevin,

Here are the graphs and data recovery information for the three ZMET stations 
at Desert Sky (Clear Sky/Indian Mesa). I chose to use May 9, 2002 and did 24 
hours (one of the stations was pretty flaky before May 8 in the afternoon). I 
don't know if these readings make sense, but we got exactly the expected 
number so 100% recovery. Hopefully these graphs finish up this testing phase.

Mark

Gents,

I was asked to provide the following information along with the data I will 
be sending and taking with me next week.

Could you also please advise re. the following:

- Definition of the availability figure given in the monthly
availability report.
- Duration of the down-time due to columnar shut-down.

Could you confirm the following definition of availability we use in the 
monthly owner report:

Contractual Availability = (TO - DT - RT -MT)/(TO - LOT - MTprorated) * 100%

Also, do we track direction (columnar) curtailment at desert sky?  I will 
verify if there mean Utility curtailment in the morning.

I need to provide this information with the data I'll be sending to Garrad 
Hassan.

Tom,

Here is a sample of the output for this request. For this I have only used 
May 2002. I for the boxplots one has had records removed when the ambient and 
gearbox temp is less than 0 (I can provide turbines and times if needed). 
There were many records where this occured. There were also 5 records where 
the Gearbox temp was over 100 and these were also removed. All of these over 
100 records occured on turbine 105 on May 1st between 1640 and 1740 (UTC). 
Temperatures were as high as 366. 

If this format is acceptable let me know and I will generate graphs for the 
data we have (Jan - "current" 2002).

Mark

Mark:

As per our phone conversation, please generate these two bin-averaged power 
curves for turbine #2 at Montfort. 

1) Consider all data from the month of February
2) Consider data only from Feb. 9 to the end of February

Please use 0.5 m/s bins.

The prefered output for this work is a single plot showing both power curves.

Getting these results by the end of this week would be perfect.

Thanks,

It is vital that you leave your computer equipment in the office this 
weekend.  If you take your laptop home, we will not be able to join you to 
the new domain this weekend which means you will not be able to log on and 
work on Monday morning.

Thank you for your cooperation.

John,

Terrie Smith is trying to move data from the site to the transfer directory. 
This is taking an enormous amount of time (Almost 24 hours to move the files 
for 107 folders of data). Is there a better method to make the transfer? How 
can we get the data transfered quickly from that site to here?

Jeff,

This e-mail is intended to describe our existing and potential capabilities 
with respect to turbine performance analysis.  Using existing SCADA data we 
presently have the ability to perform both optimization and diagnostics for 
turbine performance.  In the future, we can develop our capability to move 
into preventative repairs and maintenance.  If we make changes to the type of 
SCADA data we collect we can become more aggressive in our turbine 
performance preventative modeling and characterization.

Some examples of our current capabilities include:

1.  Yaw Activity Report:  This report is prepared and sent to each of the 750 
kW sites on a monthly basis.  Although yaw activity does not affect either 
availability or power curve (contractual items), it is critical to production 
as slight variations in yaw activity can result in big production variances.  

The purpose of this report is to identify, at a glance, the turbines which 
are experiencing excessive yaw activity relative to their neighbors.  We 
present this information graphically with an average (solid green line) and 2 
standard deviations (dashed green line) to quickly identify turbines which 
are yawing more than 2 standard deviations from the average.  Any turbine 
which is either yawing zero hours, or in excess of two standard deviations, 
should be inspected by the field personnel for turbine defects or SCADA 
system defects.

This example is for LB2, March 2002 node 1. 



2.  SCADA Power Transducer Report:  This report is prepared and sent to each 
of the 750 kW sites on a quarterly basis.  This report compares the SCADA kWh 
reading to the glass meter energy reading and looks for differences of 2.5%.  
When a difference of 2.5% is detected the particular turbine is clearly 
identified in a table for additional field troubleshooting.  

Although the site gets paid based on the substation glass meter readings, the 
SCADA kWh meter readings are very important since these are what the customer 
and operators see when they pull production information into SCADA.  To 
facilitate a good basis for decision making, and to support the integrity of 
the SCADA system, it is important to ensure the meter readings are as 
accurate as possible.

This example is for SL2, Q4 2001




Please note that the decision not to put pad mounted glass meters on the 1.5 
MW WTGs makes this analysis impossible for the 1.5 MW WTG.  However, we (the 
Engineering Power Performance Group) can (and has) put a high precision 
transducer in parallel with the SCADA kWh transducer on the 1.5 MW WTG and 
discovered the SCADA transducer to be within 1%.

3.  SPC Analytic:  This report is under development but will be completed 
either this week or next week.  We are capable of generating, and 
distributing, this report as frequently as is needed.  Our intention is to 
produce this report either weekly (when the new data arrives and is uploaded) 
or monthly, whichever, is preferred.  

This analytic is written for the 750 kW WTG but we are also preparing a 1.5 
MW WTG version.  This particular report calculates an average (green solid 
line) and a 2 standard deviation line (dashed green line) for the following 
parameters: kW, nacelle mounted wind speed, generator rpm, hub rpm, blade 
pitch, ambient temperature, gearbox temperature, generator temperature, 
hydraulic oil temperature, hydraulic oil pressure #1, hydraulic pressure #2, 
AC Mains voltage, AC Mains current phase A, AC Mains current phase B, AC 
Mains phase C, AC Mains frequency, Op hours, Available hours, Line hours, EPC 
hours, Generator hours, Hydraulic hours, Yaw hours, and kW hours.  As can be 
seen here, we have the analytic working but we are completing the process so 
our clerical staff can both generate and distribute the report.

This particular example is for Cabazon for the month of February 2002.  



4.  Non-Routine report:  We provide a number of non-routine reports for both 
diagnostic and proof of concept purposes.  I have attached two examples here 
to illustrate these types of reports but basically we are capable of applying 
complex statistical and mathematical formulas to turbine performance, and 
other, data to answer very practical questions.

This example is a request that came from Engineering and Asset Management to 
determine the suitability for installation of Ride Through kits.  This 
example demonstrates some of the advanced statistical methodologies we have 
available for application to employ on behalf of other EWC, or customer, 
organizations. 

 

This next example was prepared for the Engineering Department in their 
efforts to understand the blade pitch problem.  Engineering suspected a 
correlation between vibration faults and improper blade pitch so we prepared 
a graph which displayed the total number of vibration and blade asymmetry 
faults.  The results were provided to Engineering within 24 hours of the 
request.



5.  Owner Reports:  We prepare performance reports for each of our sites on a 
monthly basis.  These reports supply the turbine performance information 
needed to fulfill contractual obligations for performance reporting.  
Included here are examples for both a 1.5 MW WTG site (Trent) and a 750 kW 
site (SL2).



6.  Future Report:  As we complete the SPC analytic we will turn our 
attention to development of a power curve report.  This report will be 
produced on a quarterly basis and will detect degradation in the power curve 
over time.  The specification for this report has been developed and will 
compare relative power curves for both the 750 and 1.5 turbines.  The basis 
for the report will be a power curve which is displayed graphically, on a 
turbine by turbine basis, for the same quarter from previous years.  In other 
words, for the first quarter in 2002 the graph will include Q1 from 1999, 
2000, 2001 and 2002.  The second quarter graph will include Q2 from 1999, 
2000, 2001 and 2002.  

The reason for assigning the Quarters this way is to control for changes in 
atmospheric conditions (i.e. density, relative humidity, wind, etc) and 
isolate long term turbine performance.   With this report we should be able 
to identify problem turbines and take remedial action resulting in increased 
production. 




The report examples so far have all been illustrative of our ability to 
provide diagnostic and optimization information to the field, customers and 
other internal organizations.  We have a great potential to move beyond these 
levels of reporting into predictive and preventative maintenance situations.  
Here are several examples of what might be possible if we changed some of our 
processes or strategies:

1.  Without modifying the existing SCADA system we currently have the ability 
to evaluate numbers of cycles of various pieces of equipment and compare that 
to failure data to predict component failure.  However, our current 
development/construction/operations process resulted in incomplete data sets 
for the 1.5 MW WTG so we cannot fully bring this ability to bear.  A great 
example of this is the blade failures at Trent Mesa where some of the blades 
seem to be cracking and failing prematurely.  If the presumption is made that 
the failure is related to load cycles (reasonable), and those load cycles are 
not thermally based (also reasonable), then we could have compared the cycles 
and predicted which blade set was at the highest risk of failing next.  Armed 
with this information, we could direct our field crews straight to the 
pertinent turbines to conduct inspections and possibly do repairs before a 
failure occurred.

If we want to have this capability in the future, we must ensure that SCADA 
is operational when the WTG is operational and that we collect, and store, 
the data from the time the turbine commences operation.

2.  If we are willing to add vibration monitoring equipment, such as 
accelerometers, to critical bearings and rotating equipment we should be able 
to predict the time to failure for these components.  Having this ability 
would enable us to avoid consequential damage to other components and also 
allow us to pick a convenient time for a scheduled outage to conduct 
repairs.  Having a methodology such as this would also enable us to service, 
or replace, components as the component came to the end of life versus 
maintaining a maintenance schedule which replaces components on a calendar 
schedule (i.e not the actual end of component life). 

This would require both a modification to the turbine (additional 
transducers) and to the SCADA system.

3.  If we were to engage a Reliability Engineering function in our company we 
would be able to develop a much more advanced ability to engage in predictive 
and preventative maintenance.  To the best of my knowledge we do not have 
anyone within EWC performing this role.

I have not provided an exhaustive list of our capabilities.  Rather my 
intention has been to equip you with knowledge and understanding of what we 
are capable of today, and some of the possibilities for tomorrow.  Please let 
me know if you would like additional information or examples or whether you 
have any questions.

Best Regards,
Hollis

Matt,

Here are the direction for down loading the curtailment file on the 
curtailment computer.  We need the following file.

CURTAIL200205.DB

We will need to grab this file each month, and were planing to put together a 
SUB to document the procedure.  If you don't need a SUB let me know.  

This should be a very temporary situation since we will be pushing the 
curtailment data onto the SQL server that should be at the site next week.  I 
currently have plans to travel to the site on Wed. 26th for the morning and 
early afternoon.

Let me know if there are any questions.

The curtailment program's log file "CURTAILyyyymm.DB", is stored on the 
computer running the curtailment software.
At Desert Sky (Indian Mesa/Clear Sky) this is the second park computer.  IP 
address: 192.168.0.253
On this computer the database files is stored in "C:\Visupro\TrbCurtail\" 
folder.

Kurt,

Matt has determined that we have already supplied most of January with 
additional January data is available (Matt has already provided me with those 
files). 

However, the turbine 10-minute data is nonexistent for January. We have data 
for approximately the last week of January for 3 (three) turbines. This data 
appears to have come out of FreeAna files that were probably delivered in 
February. Prior to Mid February the only files we have  for Clear Sky are the 
"Mon" files. There may be a little data used in SCADA testing for periods 
before that, however none of that appears to have been in January.

Bo and Klaus, Ward Marshall is now asking for January data at Clear Sky. If 
you recall, Mark Fisher and Matthew Meyers put together the wind and turbine 
performance data for Feb. and we sent that to Ward last week. There are going 
to be a couple of issues with providing this data for Jan.
The data collection for the turbines was less reliable in January.
The wind data should be OK, Matthew?
The curtailment data is going to be sorely lacking, during the month of 
January we were only tracking the time and I believe the number of turbines 
off-line during curtailments, not the specific wtg's off-line due to 
curtailment. This going to make the actual lost energy calculation much more 
difficult and open to question.

Mark and Matthew are going to get started on this asap, I would suggest that 
Bo, Klaus and myself discuss this issue on Friday AM.

Bo/Mike,

We can provide Jim the answers to item #1 and item #8.  We can provide a 
partial answer for item #2 but we cannot give a complete answer since we do 
not have VisuPro data all the way back to the commissioning date.  The 
partial answer to #2 will center on total operational hours (SOT) and the 
capacity factors by month.  

We do not have any visibility into item #10 so we are unable to help on that 
one.

I understand a similar request for information will be coming in for turbine 
#30.  We should be able to provide answers for those questions as well.

Stan,

I have dropped the resulting graphs in your transfer directory. You'll find 
the graphs for Wind Speed, Nacelle Position, and Power in Trent_graphs.pdf, 
for each of these graphs you should find 144 records. The production graphs 
are in Trent _graphs_production.pdf, for each of these graphs you should find 
261-262 records (5.5 minutes between records). Both of these look very good 
for the 15th (5:00 am UTC to 5:00 am UTC on the 16th). All 100 turbines are 
represented and all appear to have at the very worst 98% data recovery, most 
were near 100%.

I don't remember if the Trent test needed the summaries of the counters and 
availability calculations, but those in as trent011502.pdf if you need/want 
them. Finally, I have provided the zip file if you need to provide these 
graphs to someone else.

The results look good to me, so unless you find something wrong, it looks 
like a pass!

I am not aware of any offsite guidance to use virtual mode for other than 
short duration troubleshooting.   Turbine 9 was in virtual mode for 
approximately 40 hours.  This will have the appearance of improperly 
manipulating availability so that it is higher than it should be.  The owner 
would argue that the turbine should have been left faulted offline or the 
repair switch thrown.  System Performance Group will see if we can assess how 
prevelent this was at Mill Run when there were no gaps in 10 minute data.   
It is possible that this virtual mode use was rare or of little practical 
effect. I am not going to mention this to anyone outside of Systems 
Performance Group & Joe Thorpe until we know how prevelent it was.

Mark,
 I talked to the employee that preformed the late night operations, and he 
confirmed that he put the turbine in virtual mode on the night the turbine 
faulted. This was not corrected until the crews were instructed to put the 
turnine into repair mode to perform the repairs. This has been addressed and 
all personnel understand the repercussions. If there are any other questions 
please let me know.

I have put the things that should have come to you in the interdepartmental 
mail. 

A couple of questions.

(1) are there official times when the tests occured at Indian Mesa and Trent? 
Trent offical start was March 7th at noon, end March 8th at noon. Indian Mesa 
offical start was March 11 at 9:30 and end on March 12 at 9:30. Both sites 
are Central Standard Time. 

(2) I have placed Indian Mesa as the higher priority. Is this correct? YES.

Matt,

Here are the direction for down loading the curtailment file on the 
curtailment computer.  We need the following file.

CURTAIL200205.DB

We will need to grab this file each month, and were planing to put together a 
SUB to document the procedure.  If you don't need a SUB let me know.  

This should be a very temporary situation since we will be pushing the 
curtailment data onto the SQL server that should be at the site next week.  I 
currently have plans to travel to the site on Wed. 26th for the morning and 
early afternoon.

Let me know if there are any questions.

The curtailment program's log file "CURTAILyyyymm.DB", is stored on the 
computer running the curtailment software.
At Desert Sky (Indian Mesa/Clear Sky) this is the second park computer.  IP 
address: 192.168.0.253
On this computer the database files is stored in "C:\Visupro\TrbCurtail\" 
folder.

Mark Eilers, Fisher and Ratekin: 

Mark Ratekin has in his possession an IEC standard power curve for the 
Tehachapi 1.5 Turbine. This power curve shows both the power produced and the 
power cunsumed below cut in wind speeds. The consumed power can be binned 
just like the production curve to produce a "energy consumed" for any given 
wind site. 

Perhaps Mark Ratekin can forward this curve to Mark Fisher for this type of 
analysis.

Subject: Re: Consumption for for GE1.5  

Mark,

Will they be using some method of separating power going into  turbine from 
power coming out of the turbine? And would it be done on a turbine by turbine 
basis or would they measure at the substation? And do you know what period 
they would be using for measurement (10 minutes, hourly, daily, etc.)? 
Clarifying these might make it easier to determine what we might be able to 
figure out.

The VisuPro data collection has a consumption counter as well as a production 
counter (energy, i.e. kWh). However, both counters are net counters, so for a 
measurement period either one or the other will increment [or possibly 
neither] (VisuPro is currently set to use a 5.5 minute measurement period). 
Since the counters are net counters we don't really know the true consumption.

In a discussion between Hollis and Kevin, it was suggested that the way to 
know what the parasitic load was would be to put instruments on a turbine and 
measure what the load actually is. For further information on this you might 
contact Kevin.

Hope this helps.

Gentlemen

I need to know the power consumption level for the GE1.5, non cold weather.   
I heard 40kW which seems too high for the non-CWL or CWE.  It is also my 
understanding that the Eickhoff GB did not need to have the 35kW for 
lubercation (backup power issue).  

FPL is wanting to know the outcome of this issue so they can determine their 
demand charges.  Just so you know, the New Mexico project (200 mW) has a 
demand charge of $6/kW/mth so; 136 units * 40kW * $6 = $32,640/mth or 
$391,680/yr in demand charges.

First off I want to thank all for their involvement and assistance in 
addressing Zilkha's concerns regarding our availability calcs at Mill Run 
Somerset. The customer is far from satisfied and in fact is questioning the 
validity of our availability calcs since project inception.
I would like to suggest a conference call between Tim, Mark Walker, Joe 
Thorpe and myself on which we would briefly discuss this issue. This call 
should take no longer than 30 min. and I suggest we conduct this call today

To cut to the chase....would CB1 fault the turbine when the PMT breaker 
tripped and if so then would the downtime or line out time availability hour 
counter be incremented?    If the PMT breaker trip doesn't always cause a 
given fault then is there any easy way (SCADA data or site crew experience) 
for us to estimate what percentage of the trips did fault the turbine 
offlline due to a downtime or line out fault?  Please answer these 
questions;  we will then know what corrections, if any, we need to make to

Subject: Zilkha Availability  


Joe,
Lets not forget that we had measure problems due to failing MS3 relay in the 
SEG converter, which caused the crow bar to engage, which in turn forced CB1 
to fault.

CB1 is designed to do both synchronization and was set to protect the turbine 
and the converter in a fault condition. The original instantaneous settings 
of 8000A was too high and allowed too much current through the system that 
damaged the converter and caused IGBTs to blow before it tripped. The second 
failure was due to a QA issue with failing CB1 to trip when it was commanded 
to by the converter. In both events we had catastrophic failures and lost 2 
converters due to CB1 failing to protect the system. To remedy this problem, 
we installed the PMT for CB1 redundancy and decreased the instantaneous 
setting from 8000A to 3000A and since then we didn't have any IGBT blow ups 
or any catastrophic failures

Even though that I am still not clear about Gary's question at the end, I 
hope that the above provide some help.


Thank you,

Tim M

Subject: Zilkha Availability

Kurt,
 Per our phone conversation, Mark Fisher and myself have been discussing 
availability with Gary from Zilkha. A question arose regarding the many 
operations of our breaker in the pad mounted transformer that took place 
December through March. Gary's thought is that when we recalculate the 
availability, we need to count these times as down time and not Line Out 
Hours as they have currently been counted. I suggested that according to 
Exhibit GG in the TSIA, LOH is defined in short as any time the grid does not 
meet "(i) the specifications required by the WTG as set forth in the 
Technical Specifications", and Gary agrees with this. The problem is that an 
engineering change on the breaker settings was implemented some time in March 
to reduce the number of breaker operations on site. We are still seeing many 
grid faults in the turbine but not in the PMT breaker. The question that Gary 
brought up is were the original settings of the breaker set to the WTG 
Technical Specifications and operating due to the on going grid conditions OR 
were the settings improper to start with causing the breaker to operate while 
the grid was within Technical Specifications.

On Friday Joe said that he would send us the timeslices of pause mode events 
and any PMT breaker operations that were brought up by Verkleeren or that 
were presented to Verkleeren.   We would then use SCADA data to take a 
rigorous look at these timeslices.   Are there any?  If so, then please send 
them to us.   We can't wrap up the Verkleeren reply until we have these.

John,

If you haven't already taken charge of this, could you work with Patricia to 
test the data that Kim Nguyen sent.  Be sure to pass on the results of this 
test to Kim and Ron Brzeniski.  

Mark,  thanks for jumping in.  There are some features of the tool sent from 
Clemens which may be useful, but I do not think it is ready.

Tom,

Here is the report I prepared on the methods and types of grpahs for this 
work request. As examples I used the May 2002 graphs, including the Paretos 
for the Pitch and overspeed faults. If you need additional clarification, or 
have questions let me know.

Please familiarize yourself with GE's Mail retention Policy.  It is 
substantially different from what we are used to.

--D

GE's Mail Retention Policy

E-mail is a tremendous productivity tool, but its volume and use carry with
it a number of issues. Keeping up with the volume of e-mail is burdensome,
indeed often stressful. The unnecessary retention of e-mail uses valuable IT
resources, and the volume of unnecessary e-mail slows down our ability to
process and find the materials we really need. Importantly, recent court
cases illustrate how e-mails, which are so useful because of their
informality and speed, can become the subject of intense scrutiny over
meanings the authors may never have intended. Words and phrases intended to
be ironic, sarcastic or amusing can be taken out of context with
embarrassing - and unintentionally harmful - consequences.
  (1) Proper document retention is one important way to
control these burdens and risks. Our company policy has been to discard
unneeded e-mail after 30 days. To implement this policy, we are, beginning
September 1, 1999, instituting automatic deletion of e-mail in primary
e-mail folders (Inbox, Outbox, Sent Items, Drafts) company-wide after 30
days. In addition, e-mails stored in other folders will be deleted after 365
days. Finally, you should save e-mails on your local hard-drive only where
it is essential (the auto-delete will not operate on the local hard drive).
  These automatic deletion procedures will be subject to legal
limits on document destruction, limits that apply to e-mails. When an
employee's e-mail is potentially relevant to litigation or threatened
litigation, counsel for your business will cause the automatic suspend
feature to be disabled for an appropriate time period. A second limitation
involves retention of certain records required by law in such areas as tax,
EHS, government contracts. Such limitations will be implemented on a
business-by-business basis and in corporate components.
  Accordingly, for employees in the businesses, your General
Counsel and Messaging Leader will be in touch with you about implementation
of the auto delete feature in the next week or so. For corporate employees,
Brackett Denniston and David Etue will provide further guidance shortly.
  (2) But proper document retention practices represent only
part of the answer to minimizing the risk that e-mails will be misunderstood
or used improperly by our adversaries. The best solution, of course, is to
ensure that we compose our e-mail carefully and sensibly, just as we would
any other written communication. In that regard, we are attaching a list of
tips and best practices. Following these suggestions and practices will
improve the clarity of our communications and address their volume as well.
We believe that we can improve the use and productivity by taking the time
to write e-mail intelligently, and by retaining only those e-mails required
by law.
Thanks for your help.

Mark,

The operating state codes 2 to 6 represent manual pitch overide. 
The user can issue these pitch overides from the "Control blade angle" screen 
as shown in Figure-1.

The operating state code 13 represent manual speed overide.  
The user can issue this speed overide from the "Control speed" screen as 
shown in Figure-2.

Note that if both manual speed control and manual pitch control are issued at 
the same time 
then the manual pitch control status is only shown for the operating state.


Figure-1


Figure-2



Operating State (Channel 29)

 Value Description

 0: Spare
 1: Spare
 2: Blade angle setpoint (all blades)
 3: Blade angle plus
 4: Blade angle minus
 5: Blade angle stop
 6: Blade angle setpoint (single blades)
 7: Spare
 8: Spare
 9: Spare
 10: Spare
 11: Feathering position
 12: Idle position
 13: Manual speed setting
 14: Run up
 15: Idle position 
 16: Load operation
 17: Manual torque setting
 18: Shut down (speed)
 19: Shut down load 
 20: Grid disconnection


Note: Operating state gets averaged in the 10-min data (Minana.db), 
 and will not be accurate if the turbine changes state during the
 10-minute period.

Subject: Operating State 29

Joe Chapman sent us an email listing a short textual description associated 
with each value of Operating State 29.  Some are easy to interpret (ex. 11 is 
"Feathering position") because they are a visible element on the state 
transition diagram in the controller document supplied by Garth.  Others 
aren't easy to interpret.   Where should we look to understand the triggering 
criteria for text strings associated with Operating states 0-6 and 13.   We 
are willing to do the work of reading the documentation if you can tell us 
what to read.  These values are labeled "Blade angle setpoint (all blades)",  
" Blade angle plus", "Blade angle minus",  "Blade angle stop", " Blade angle 
setpoint (single blades)", and "Manual speed setting".    I assume from these 
names and the fact that they are not common in the SCADA data that all but 
Blade angle stop are solely used for controller parameter changes or software 
changes.   We want to use Operating State 29 in our Statistical Process 
Control and reporting logic but the lack of understanding on these parameter 
values holds us back.

Over the next few weeks there will be crews working in the North and South 
buildings installing new computer and telephone network wiring.  This effort 
is part of an overall project to upgrade the network and add capacity to the 
computer infrastructure in Tehachapi .  The wiring effort will include all 
offices, cubicles, conference rooms, and trailers.  The wiring will be all 
new and will not disrupt current network service during the transition.  

The wiring will start in the North and South buildings later this week and 
will continue through to July 24.  The crews will be working from 7:00AM to 
7:30PM throughout the weeks.  Please be aware that the crews will need access 
to offices, cubicles, and conference rooms.  They will attempt to hold 
disruptions to a minimum, but will be removing ceiling tiles and installing 
new outlets for data and voice service in each of your areas.  Transition to 
the new network will be completed by July 15.  The crews will then go through 
and remove all of the old wiring.  

Your cooperation is appreciated with this effort as we work to improve the 
computing and network infrastructure in the Tehachapi campus.  Any questions, 
please direct them to Bob Grant, X6850.

Tom/Kevin,

In the development of the 1.5 MW WTG Statistical Process Control (SPC) 
reporting tool we have some additional questions regarding the data which 
comes to us from VisuPro.   In the attached spreadsheet you will find a 
listing of most of the channels which VisuPro uses to record data.  With some 
exceptions, each channel should correspond to a transducer on the turbine.  
The channel name and number can be found in the left columns as they are 
presented in VisuPro.  The "Alias" column is my attempt to better understand 
the channel and put a more meaningful label on the channel for presentation 
to the field personnel.  Wherever there is a blank it means that I do not 
have a good explanation of the channel and need more information.  

You can ignore the grey shading.  It is just an indicator as to whether the 
particular channel is currently included in the existing version of our SPC 
analytic.  The more interesting column is the "Include" column which is our 
future plan regarding inclusion of the particular channel in the next 
revision of the analytic.

Please do provide comments regarding simplified label names.  Also please 
note that I need further clarification on cells with comments inserted (look 
for the red traingle in the top right corner of 3 of the cells).

The other thing I would really like to have is a picture, or drawing, of the 
exact location of each of the transducers we are planning on including.  This 
would give myself and the field personnel great insight as to what the 
measurements really represent.

Thanks,
Hollis

Kurt, 

Attached is the wind rose portion of the Desert Sky owner report.  As you are 
well aware a mean wind speed can misrepresent the expected energy output, 
which is more dependent on the shape of the wind distribution.

In addition, this mean wind speed is a single point wind speed measurement.  
So, it can not completely represent all of the micro-siting characteristics 
of such a large site alone.  

The good news is it is the most centrally located station at hub height.

Ward:
I have added a tab on the previous file (attached here), with 15-minute
intervals, from the ERCOT data. ?If you check the tab with the total of
each curtailment period, you will see numbers similar to the 10-minute
data, and a total at the bottom of the table that is roughly the same. 
What does this mean? ?I suppose it shows that the 10-min data was as
accurate as the 15-min data, and that the innaccuracies come from some
other source, such as log entries, which turbines were actually
curtailed, etc. ?I noticed at least a couple of time when the number of
turbines listed in the outage table does not match the list of
individual turbines, and when the number of hours does not match the
start and end times of the curtailed periods.
I think this at least answers one of the questions about which data set
can be used.
I'm hopeful that looking at each hour of both techniques shows a small
difference over the whole month will prove to be useful.

Some time ago, I sent an e-mail to everyone asking that they print/save an 
e-mail from GE that indicated their username and password for Domino 
Accounts.  For your reference, I am forwarding my notification as an 
example.  Please go through your Lotus Notes file and find your 
notification.  Either print the notification or write down your username and 
password.  You will need this information to use Sametime Meeting, Sametime 
Connect, and QuickPlace after we cutover to GE's network this weekend.

Subject: Domino Account Created


Denise,

A Lotus Domino ID and password has been created for you.
         Username: XXXXXXXXX
         Password: XXXXXXXXX

Visit http://globalapp01.ge.com right now to change your
password. It only takes a minute to complete.  Like all
passwords, don't write it down and don't share it with
anyone.

This ID and password must be used for accessing
the following products:
 Sametime Meeting
 Sametime Connect (chat)
 QuickPlace (Internal and External)

Some GE businesses may also use this ID and password for
other applications based on the Lotus Domino products.
Please note, some of these applications will be switched over
to GE Single Sign On very soon. When you see the SSO logo,
use your SSO ID and password instead of this one.  For more
information, please contact your local help desk.

Please do not reply to this auto-generated email message.
If you have a question, please contact your help desk.

We have the new software.  Rabi will load SPlus and Oracle on his and my 
system to make sure he does not encounter any problems with the new GE Core 
Load.  Once our test is complete, then you can coordinate with IT (Denise & 
David Draper) to get your machine's Core Load.  Rabi will re-install S-Plus 
(new version) and Oracle after the GE Windows 2000 Core Load.  You analyst 
just need to coordinate your Core Load with Rabi so he can get Splus and 
Oracle properly loaded on your new system.

Subject: New 6.1 Version of SPLUS will be shipped soon.

FYI, a new version of SPLUS is coming.  I've been coordinating with Tech 
Support at Insightful about some erratic or erroneous behaviour in timeDate 
data.   One problem which limits what timeseries plots for Owner reporting we 
can do is supposedly solved in the new 6.1 version of SPLUS that is shipping 
this week or next.   Mark Fisher, Jeff, and I have all encountered 
aggravating problems with time series data that may partly go away in the new 
version.    It would be great to load the new version when your manpower 
allows.    We know you are very busy.   Thanks.

Hollis - 

Per our last phone call, I made the changes (in red) to the Clipper 
Availability to suite what I believe is a good definition for us 
(incorporates Mark(s) comments which I added).  Please review and comment so 
I can send this file on to Mark Eilers.  Please view this document in a 
Commercial light as spoke, thus looking at what favors EWC.  Please call to 
discuss.

Thanks,
Ilan

PS - Dave Schulgen put together a chart which outlines EWC maintenance costs 
per year for 1.5 maintenance.  His work indicates that 72 hours (rather than 
36/48) should be the standard (with an increase in the later years for 
additional work).  This is reflected in the attachment.

Hey guys, the attached is the curtailment page from the Feb. Clear Sky 
monthly report. This format is one that I would like to stick with but if it 
not practical to provide the information in this format it is acceptable to 
alter or change it as long as we provide the information in one form or 
another. I am not sure what drove the change in format but we need to decide 
how this information will be provided and stick with it on a consistent 
basis. With the coming changes in the Asset Management group it behooves us 
to standardize each portion of the monthly report. The person responsible for 
compiling the information contained in the report as well as preparing the 
monthly reports is going to change very soon. 

Lets discuss this soon as the March reports are due next week.

Thanks

KA

Apparently, my instructions have confused a number of people with regard to 
the Lotus Notes ID File.  DO NOT MOVE THE ID FILE from your local drive.  
Copy it and paste the copy out on the network folder you create.  If you move 
your ID file instead of copy it, you will not be able to access Lotus Notes.

Additionally, after you move you Notes archive file, your icons on Lotus 
Notes for your local mailfile will not work.  If you must access the old mail 
between the time you move the files and the time your machine is cut over, 
follow these instructions:

>From a blank gray area on your Lotus Notes workspace, right-click and select 
open database.



Click on the Browse button



Click on the down-arrow next to look in and browse to the location of the 
data folder on the network you created:

  Inside the Lotus Notes folder you created, you will be able to see the 
names of your archived mail file.  Double-click on the file name and a new 
icon will be added to your workspace that points to this location on the 
network.

If you need further clarification, please feel free to call the help desk at 
x6862.

Jerry,

This is the cost of energy variance between actual and projected GWh for the 
site using the site specific energy pricing.  For more information where the 
pricing came from you can contact Hollis.

Subject: Output from the Global SCADA meeting in Spain, March 25 through 
March 29, 2002.

People: 

The global staff of our SCADA groups met in Madrin, Spain between March 25 to 
March 29 to discuss improvement and changes for a new version of VisuPro, 
Version IV. Although we did discuss the higher level issue of a new, 
comprenhensive, wind park based, completly revised, SCADA system -- our 
primary goal was finding ways to achieve "Customer Satisfication", with our 
current VisuPro SCADA system. 

The Tehachapi SCADA group brought with them a list of necessary fixes and 
required upgrades (40 individual issues) to the meeting. It is these issues 
we concentrated on. This list of 40 items was based on feedback from our 
customers, such as AEP, FPL, Zilka,  & NWP along with feedback from our O&M 
crew in the field, and what our own SCADA team has noticed during 
installation and operations. The attachment document is a compliation of that 
former list, where many items were already fixed, some were not necessary our 
could not be completed in a timely fashion and some were all part of a common 
group. Our new list has a total of 28 items, 5 of the highest priority, 7 of 
the second priority and 16 of the lowest priority. The responsible/lead group 
for each individual issues is also shown. 

The attached document is quite long but I suggest that everyone find the time 
to review. Our proposals include changes in the VisuPro Code, changes in the 
VisuPro data base structure, changes in the VisuPro storage capabilities and 
an additional Server PC that will provide over one full year of data storage 
and custom report generation to help achieve what everyone is asking for in 
SCADA. The details are shown in the attached document. 

The Tehachapi SCADA group has a video conference scheduled for Thursday to 
discuss the final elements of this plan -- labor resource allocation and time 
requirements to complete these proposed changes.  In light of our goal of 
having the major items running in our customers wind farms by July 15, we 
have prioritized each item. 

I will outline the final plan, including milestones and completion dates 
before April 9. 

Regards 

KLC

Currently our standard is 48 hours per year and this may be aggressive.  We 
can check into this some more but be aware that with this definition we just 
lost 25% of our maintenance time.

Subject: Proposed Clipper Availability

Mark(s) - 

Please review the attached calculation which Clipper proposes for 
Availability.  I will compare it with the contractual availability which have 
recently proposed, but would prefer your input.

Thanks,
Ilan

Ilan 

Can you please give this a quick read to see if this my work.  This is a take 
on our standard availability that Clipper is proposing.  Let me know your 
thoughts.

Kurt,
 As requested here is a brief overview of the discussion between Mark Fisher 
, myself and Gary Verklereen that took place on 6/13/02 & 6/14/02 regarding 
availability on the Millrun & Somerset sites. Mark did a great job of 
demonstrating the usefulness of the Mon.db file to Gary for the purpose of 
calculating availability, and also the method used by GE wind to determine 
availability. By the end of the second day Gary expressed he had a new found 
confidence in the accuracy of the Mon.db file data and also in general agreed 
with the method GE Wind used to calculate availability. Gary did  express a 
few concerns which are listed below. 

Gary was concerned that we may continue to overlook the fact the turbine may 
have been put into virtual mode. Mark reassured Gary that new measures were 
being taken to prevent this situation from being overlooked in the future and 
during the recalculation of the availability.

Gary also expressed that he could see no problem with the 4 hours of 
maintenance time that was being added each month as long as, in the monthly 
report the  actual availability is list in a sperate column as the adjusted 
availability.

Gary felt that in the recalculation of the availability it may be warranted 
to count the many breaker operations that occurred in the first few months of 
the project as downtime rather then Line Out Hours as they may have been 
counted. This was due to the fact that we made a adjustment to the breaker 
that later prevented it from tripping as often. This suggested to Gary that 
the breaker trips were in fact due to improper settings.

Another suggestion by Gary was that after a fault, the turbine could take as 
long as 1 to 2 minutes to began producing as the turbine performed its run up 
sequence. Gary suggested that during the winter months when the turbines 
experienced hundreds of Low Gearbox Oil Pressure faults, that this 1 to 2 
minute run up sequence would equate to several hundred minutes were the 
turbine reported available, but was not truly available to produce. He 
concluded that in the recalculation we may want to count this time as 
downtime.

When asked what method could be agreed upon during the recalculation, Gary 
stated that after reviewing the method we used he could see no problem with 
it as long as we did not overlook things like the virtual mode. Gary also 
stated that as long as the final availability was within 1% of his 
calculations he would have no complaints. If the final availability numbers 
were greater then 1% of his calculations then he would need a break down of 
what was counted and what was not counted for review.

Since we all have active Outlook express mailboxes with GE which are 
forwarding to
our current Lotus Notes email addresses, you may get an automatically 
generated email
with account information in it. I am specifically referring to your Domino
username/passwords. Domino accounts are used for Sametime chat and
Quickplace access, two programs that are used by everyone at GE. These emails 
are 
generated as the users are populated into Oracle HR.  It is very important 
that you
save the information contained in this automatically generated email in a 
safe 
place until cutover when you will be able to use these accounts. The Domino 
account 
email contains a randomly generated password for each user, so if it is lost 
the password 
must be reset, which will cause delays and extra effort in the user getting 
this
access. 

Thanks.

Flemming,
In reviewing the Klondike visupro files for processing for the month of 
June,  there are minana.db files missing.
These files contain 8 days of records which gets written to every day.

Would you have the files for the Wednesday downloads for June 5, June 12, 
June 19 and June 26 downloads?

Hopefully, the download program that is being sent out to the 1.5 sites will 
help in gathering files.

If you have questions email or call me 661 - 823 -6508

Thanks
John

Kurt,

The spreadsheet we discussed for March is attached. Having rerun the numbers 
I found a typo on the email that was sent out before. The billable 
curtailment should have been 10,737,017  not 10,737,107. This also affected 
the Curtailed production.Taking this typo into account the values in the 
spreadsheet agree with the values previously provided. The spreadsheet is 
still in the order that the site provided, not time or turbine sorted. In 
addition I haven't done any formatting, so number of decimals varies. Lastly 
the times in this sheet, unlike the sheet from the site, are in UTC like 
SCADA (VisuPro).

Mark

Thanks, Mark.
Let me know when you've completed your process.

Alaadin referenced WTGs 24, 25, 27, in his e-mail.
These were known to have stopped collecting data for a 10 hour period.
WTG 31 was undergoing maintenance.  The data was collected, but distributed 
over four different files
WTG 90 is missing about two hours
Turbines no. 47 & 48 were under major repairs and were not included on the ATP
(reference Alaadin's original correspondence at the end of this e-mail)

In our Final Report, we will emphasize the new VisuPro v4 in July and the 
Hirschmann switch retrofit.
These upgrades will minimize many of our existing problems.

Ron,

The data for the Trent ATP is being uploaded and I have taken a quick look. 
For the data already uploaded 24,25, and 27 don't look good for the 24 hour 
period. I will look for a previous 24 hour period for just those turbines 
(though that does not seem to be valid in the context of the test). For 
turbines 31 and 90 I will do the same otherwise the loss of 2 hours of data 
will drop the recovery  to 92%.

Here are some graphs to look at. Our data loading priority is changing and 
that could affect how fast the remaining data will be uploaded.

Hi Mark,
I did the ATP for SCADA system in Trent on April 13th at 11:40am (CT) 4:40pm 
(UTC), it lasted for 24hours. I collected the database files from all the 
turbines.
The following is the observations for the data collected:
Turbines no. 47 & 48 were under major repairs and were not included on the 
ATP, so total number if turbines is 98..
During the night of the test turbines no. 24,25, & 27 stopped collecting 
data, and I reset Visupro application in the morning, so there is a 10 hours 
worth of data lost, I suggest we shift the starting time of the test for only 
these turbines so we can get 24hours of data.
Turbine no. 31 has some repairs done to it during the night of the test and I 
didn't have notice of these repairs, I managed to capture the data for the 
24hours test in four seperate files, two files minana.db and minana_2.db for 
the 10 minute average and statdat.db and stadat_2.db for the status. I 
believe there is 2 hours worth of data still missing.
Turbine no. 90, kept rebooting in the morning and I had to go to the turbine 
and restart the PC, it worked fine for the rest of the day but there is 2 
hours worth of data missing.
Other than that the data looks fine for all the rest of the turbine.
I am transfering the files right now to your folder on the transfer server, 
the folder name is SCADA ATP Trent, and also I will UPS to you by overnight 
delivery the data on a CD.
If you have any questions please feel free to call me at 661-332-6348, I will 
be in Indian Mesa site until Saturday.
Regards,
Alaadin

Attached please find a new Statistical Process Control analytic which 
displays the turbine performance for your site.  The report pdf is a summary 
of the other two reports and delineates which turbines fall outside the 2 
sigma line for each category.  The other two reports provide more detail 
regarding the turbine performance including the degree to which a turbine 
falls outside the 2 sigma line.

Please note that we are still working with the analytic and you will find 
some extraneous characters in the results.  Please add these characters in 
with the main group for which they are intended.  We will have them removed 
from the code next month.

Best Regards,
Hollis

Kim,
I uploaded the files using the SQL uploader program and found no problems 
with the upload process.

However, I am confused about the sample data's origin. Are they from Monfort 
or Klondike? Or are these just test data?
When I open the files the system numbers indicate that they were from the 
Monfort site.

If the files were tested from Klondike, the system number should be 840008001 
(008 is the site number for Klondike). 
I am hoping the download program does not change the system number to 001 for 
a site.

Thank you
-John

Hi Mark,

(1) yes, metmast are to be configured like you thought (Met[metId#] (WTG#)
(2) yes, I incorporated that adjustment for all monthly db files. 

Attached are sample data of each download



thanks you...Kim

Subject: Re: Autodownload tool  

Kim,

This looks pretty good, and will certainly be helpful to the people at the 
site trying to do the downloads. Just a couple of points:

(1) From this I don't understand how metmasts are to be configured. So maybe 
some clarification of that would be good. (Is it Met[met#] (WTG#) ?)

(2) For the Monyymm.db files, we need to get both the current month and the 
previous month (at least for the 1st week of the month), I can't tell if this 
software is doing that.

This looks like this should provide a big help in downloading data. Do you 
have a sample that you can send so we can compare to what our oracle upload 
script is expecting? (Just to be sure.)

Hope my comments are helpful.

Mark

hi Mark,

The files-download tool is finished, but before we deploy it to the field,  
can  you please review the Auto-download Program Version 1 spec and let me 
know if it follows the requirements?   Also, I am modifying the code for 
version 2. Thus, it is very important that I hear from you.  Thank you much!

Kim,

First, Hollis will be out of the office until further notice.  I'll be 
coordinating his tasks for the time being.  Since I don't have the full back 
ground on this development here are my thoughts.

I agree we should work towards the best solution for the task.  It may be 
that the version you are testing is that solution.  The immediate problem we 
are trying to solve is;

1) the sites spend too much time downloading these files
2) we need data consistently and frequently here in Tehachapi, system 
performance team,
3) the sooner we have a solution the more time we will save.

A quick review of the REC document indicates some type of download cycle in 
addition to file format, which would be useful for other reasons.  The on 
site servers are not set up to store real-time data currently, nor is the SQL 
transfer program currently designed to accommodate all of the various files 
listed in either solution.

Last thing, would it be possible for you to send me test data so we can test 
out upload to our STAR db.  There shouldn't be an issue, but this would 
complete a 360 test.

Hi Hollis,

It seems that REC- SCADA is working on the same task as I am, though the 
actual coding has yet begun.  I have coded and now testing at Klondike a 
simplified version of this task (spec. attached).    But before I start to 
modify the code for version 2, perhaps we and REC project leader of this tool 
should come together to derive an optimal decision for this task. What are 
your thoughts?

Tom,

Here are the new graphs with totals (bar charts) and distributions (boxplots) 
for all seven sites through May 2002. 

I believe that I have come up with a method of providing you with the 
ESTIMATED energy lost. Since it requires using two data sets (faults and 
10-minute data) it will be take a bit longer to run. However I hope to have 
that result to you next week. 

Mark

Kevin

I'm glad your clarified what information was to be gotten out of the 
attachment as I was scratching my head over that one.  

I think your approach of reviewing the an existing project is a good one.  I 
know that Mark F. has done some work on this issue (see that attachment) 
which we can build on.  I do have a concern about using Montfort given that 
it is a cold weather turbine and a low wind site which can lead to an 
overstatement of power consumption depending on how the analysis is done.  
That being said, we will need to get an idea of the power consumption for the 
CWE and CWL but the immediate task is for FPL New Mexico which we are 
thinking is a standard unit.  

Given that the cumulative load (on paper) per WTG is ~40kW, of which a 
majority is the yaw motors, I would think that there is a low probability 
that all the yaw motors will be drawing (in a pre synchronous mode) at the 
same time, therefore, perhaps a statistical solution like taking the square 
root of the number of WTGs in the park times 40kW is a statically valid 
approach in determining "possible" peak power demand for a given period.  
Furthermore, should this become an important issue for the owner I am sure 
some solution could be make in the WTG to mitigate peak power demand in the 
park.     

So in summary, my feeling is that we look at a non-CW park to generate 
empirical comsumption data that can then be compared to the above statistical 
approach and see how they compare.  

Mark

Mark, Mark and Mark: 

I have reviewed the attached power curve and clearly it will not help in 
formulating an answer to your question. 

I would like to ask Mark Fisher to look at a typical installation (any one of 
our field sites) and give us data on kWh consumed by several turbines over a 
multi-month period with data arranged month by month. Perhaps one or two 
turbines at Monfort would be the best because we can look at a whole year of 
data. This would tell us what was produced and what was consumed in energy. 

Mark Eilers, what do you think?

Ron,

Garth did a good job on answering some of the questions about which counters 
were used for different situations. But there are still a lot of holes. We 
need to know all of the answers regarding the counters in the VisuPro 
program. The owners also need this information. During your talks with the 
programmers, ask if they have this information.

Thanks

I did not get the password. David Miller and John Lapham said, they will 
create a user with administrative privilege, 
which I can use for administration. In the meantime I will come to your desk 
to take a look at the problem.

Subject: StatServer Administration

Rabi,

I have done some further exploration of the timeout problem on the 
StatServer. I have tested the ASP page timeout and that does appear to exceed 
5 minutes. Therefore the problem may be in the statserver configuration. 
There is a setting labeled "Request Timeout interval" that might be causing 
the problem. If it is set for 5 minutes that would explain the problem. 

Have you been able to get the new administrator password so that you can look 
at how the software is configured?

If this is not the problem could there be something limiting how long the 
connection to Oracle remains open?

Anyway, a couple of more ideas.

Mark

If I had looked more closely, I would have seen that bootstrap() returns
the component "replicates", from which one can compute empirical
confidence intervals.  Thanks to Peter Ellis and Mark Fisher for their help.

Denise,

A couple of questions about software. 

I have used and would like to continue to use MiKTeX (A windows version of 
TeX, the technical typesetting program). I find it is useful for 
automatically formatting reports in fact I have designed the automated 
summary report for the turbine SPC report using this program. This is 
freeware. (The TeX users group http://www.tug.org/ has information of TeX 
implementations. MiKTeX is probably the best, but PCTeX by Personal TeX is a 
good non-free version). Please let me know what will need to be done so that 
I can continue to use this software.

I was also planning to start Syncing my PDA with Outlook (as soon as Outlook 
is configured for use). So can I install the "Palm" software for this purpose?

Gary,

On behalf of the GEWE Systems Performance team, please find a re-calculation 
of Monthly Availability for both the Mill Run and Somerset projects.  The 
following work is in response to your findings regarding availability 
incrementing with no power production above cut in wind speeds, conveyed 
through both Kurt Anderson and through Mark Fisher's meeting with you in 
early June.

The following methodology incorporates criteria discussed during Mark Fisher 
visit.  We are planning to provide some detailed examples later this week for 
your review.  I anticipate we will then discuss the methodology via 
conference.  The intent would be to use this fully automated methodology to 
account for this situation on a go forward basis.

Please feel free to contact myself of Kurt Anderson.

P.S.  Due to a transition of our email, please copy any email to @ps.ge.com 
and @enron.com as we are making a complete GE transition on Monday.

Ruth,

We have had a request from our commercial group for turbine availability 
numbers with the availability as defined by Vestas.  The purpose of this is 
to present a chart with the Vestas availability definition applied on our 
turbines during the AWEA conference in two weeks.

Do you have the ability to calculate availability of our 1.5 WTGs in Europe 
using the Vestas definition of availability?  If so would you provide this 
information for the 1.5 WTGs during the year 2001?

The Vestas definition of availability is :  (Hours of Wind Turbine in 
Operation mode / Hours of Grid in Operation Mode) * 100%.

If you do not have this calculation do you have summarized counter data for 
the European 1.5 fleet by month for the year 2001?  This is not a request for 
the individual VisuPro files but rather some sort of consolidated data 
(Excel, Access, etc) which shows each counter value for each turbine for the 
month.  If you have this data then I think we could produce a Vestas 
availability number to use in AWEA.

I know this is a big request so I thank-you in advance!

Best Regards,
Hollis

Mark, as per our discussion I will require the Feb. curtailment at Clear Sky 
to calculated using the same methodology as was used in the latest March 
calculation. This data is required for the March owner report which must be 
sent to the owner today.

Thank you very much for your understanding and support regarding this issue.

Explainations:

Predicted: For each 10 minute interval and each turbine the wind speed was 
converted to a power. The power for each 10 minute interval was then 
averaged, to produce a mean power for the site. This number was then scaled 
by the number of turbines to produce a site wide power value, that value was 
then converted to an energy value.

Curtailment: Curtailment logs were provided by the site giving the turbine 
number and the start and stop time of the curtailment. For each curtailment 
period the wind speed was found. Due to the fact that wind speeds are lower 
on non-producing turbines, the wind speed was scaled up by approximately 5%. 
This wind speed was then converted to power, and then energy. The value of 
the curtailment number is the sum for all curtailments. 

Unavailable: The Curtailment value was removed from the predicted production 
and the result multiplied by the site availability.

Difference: This is a sum total, removing the Curtailment and unavailable 
from the predicted.

Line loss: This is 98% of the Difference to estimate a 2% line loss.

Net: Is the difference of Difference and line loss.

Actual: Is taken directly from the Substation

Variance: Is the difference between the Net and Actual



Curtailed production: Is the amount of  energy not produced due to 
curtailment.
97% Availability: Is 97% of the curtailed production.
2% line loss: Is 98% of the value in 97% availability

Billable Curtailment: Is the value for Curtailment after both availability 
and line loss are taken into account.

I thought the CA included an LOT term in both the numerator and denominator, 
which is how I am coding it in the Crystal Reprots application.

Subject: Availability formulas used

These are the approximations (since no manual data was used) used in the 
tables you were provided.

"Enron Availability"     ea = (SOT+LOT+WOT+EST)/ST


Contractual Availability (EPC)  ca=(survey-DT-RT-MT)/(survey-4/(31*24))


Where

SOT= System OK time
DT= Down Time
LOT= Line Out Time
WOT= Weather Out time
EST= External Stop Time
MT= Maintenance time
RT= Repair time

ST=SOT+DT+LOT+WOT+EST+MT+RT
survey= Survey time

the 4/(31*24) is an approximation for the prorating of the allowed "4 hours 
per month" for maintenance time.

If you have questions let me know.

Mark

Subject: 1.5 MW WTG SPC reports

Tom/Kevin,

In the development of the 1.5 MW WTG Statistical Process Control (SPC) 
reporting tool we have some additional questions regarding the data which 
comes to us from VisuPro.   In the attached spreadsheet you will find a 
listing of most of the channels which VisuPro uses to record data.  With some 
exceptions, each channel should correspond to a transducer on the turbine.  
The channel name and number can be found in the left columns as they are 
presented in VisuPro.  The "Alias" column is my attempt to better understand 
the channel and put a more meaningful label on the channel for presentation 
to the field personnel.  Wherever there is a blank it means that I do not 
have a good explanation of the channel and need more information.  

You can ignore the grey shading.  It is just an indicator as to whether the 
particular channel is currently included in the existing version of our SPC 
analytic.  The more interesting column is the "Include" column which is our 
future plan regarding inclusion of the particular channel in the next 
revision of the analytic.

Please do provide comments regarding simplified label names.  Also please 
note that I need further clarification on cells with comments inserted (look 
for the red traingle in the top right corner of 3 of the cells).

The other thing I would really like to have is a picture, or drawing, of the 
exact location of each of the transducers we are planning on including.  This 
would give myself and the field personnel great insight as to what the 
measurements really represent.

Thanks,
Hollis

Thanks for the feedback Matt, I understand why the format needed to change. 
Now we need to decide how we will incorporate the data from the revised 
curtailment report into the monthly report given to the owner.

Subject: Monthly Reports

Kurt, 
We changed from the Feb. curtailment format to the new format because 
curtailments are being recorded more accurately now.  Take this example of a 
typical curtailment: CPS requests that we keep each line at 30MW.  With the 
old format, we would enter one line of information that contained all of the 
turbines that were shut down.  This would work IF the same exact turbines 
were shut down for the duration of the curtailment.  This is never the case.  
To maintain a specific output (which is always what CPS requests) we are 
constantly shutting down and starting turbines due to windspeed fluctuation.  
Using the old format, there would be a new line entered every time another 
turbine was shut down or restarted.  This would also imply (inaccurately) 
that all the turbines affected by the curtailment were stopped and started 
each time a new turbine was added.  

With the new format, when we start or stop a turbine we just add another 
line.  This is the better method of the two to accurately record the down 
time, because it is itemized.  If the operators follow the procedure that has 
been given to them, this will be very accurate.  I apologize for the 
confusion over some of the information on the first March Log.  We have gone 
over the procedure again with all onsite personnel so we should not see the 
discrepancies again that we saw in March.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please give me a call.  Also, if 
you give me your fax#, I can fax you an original copy of the curtailment form 
so you can see first hand how the information is recorded.

Thank you
Matt

Hey guys, the attached is the curtailment page from the Feb. Clear Sky 
monthly report. This format is one that I would like to stick with but if it 
not practical to provide the information in this format it is acceptable to 
alter or change it as long as we provide the information in one form or 
another. I am not sure what drove the change in format but we need to decide 
how this information will be provided and stick with it on a consistent 
basis. With the coming changes in the Asset Management group it behooves us 
to standardize each portion of the monthly report. The person responsible for 
compiling the information contained in the report as well as preparing the 
monthly reports is going to change very soon. 

Lets discuss this soon as the March reports are due next week.

Thanks

These are the levels of validation used to identify wind data in WIMS.  Most 
data is stored at level 2, and cared through 3-4 during an analysis.


1. General range checking used to identify and flag outliers so that data can 
be quickly processed for a rush report.
2. Pass data through WIMS (Wind Information Management System) validation 
routine to identify and flag out-of-range values, unusual shear, sticking 
sensors, etc.
3. Same as step 2, but passed through the validation routine a second time OR 
data scrutinized by additional analysis methods OR data analyzed by more than 
one staff member.
4. Imputing data.  Replace flagged data with "false" but reasonable data 
obtained from historical archives, a best fit curve,or some other form of 
imputation etc.

Minana for Trent ATP is loaded.

There was no data for Turbine #98.  The Minana file in Folder 98 is for 
Turbine 97.

Only 106 records were recovered for Turbine #31

Only 616 records were recovered for Turbine #85

Turbine #2, 42, 74 had to also be rebuilt.

Ron,

The data for the Trent ATP is being uploaded and I have taken a quick look. 
For the data already uploaded 24,25, and 27 don't look good for the 24 hour 
period. I will look for a previous 24 hour period for just those turbines 
(though that does not seem to be valid in the context of the test). For 
turbines 31 and 90 I will do the same otherwise the loss of 2 hours of data 
will drop the recovery  to 92%.

Here are some graphs to look at. Our data loading priority is changing and 
that could affect how fast the remaining data will be uploaded.

turbines.
The following is the observations for the data collected:
Turbines no. 47 & 48 were under major repairs and were not included on the 
ATP, so total number if turbines is 98..
During the night of the test turbines no. 24,25, & 27 stopped collecting 
data, and I reset Visupro application in the morning, so there is a 10 hours 
worth of data lost, I suggest we shift the starting time of the test for only 
these turbines so we can get 24hours of data.
Turbine no. 31 has some repairs done to it during the night of the test and I 
didn't have notice of these repairs, I managed to capture the data for the 
24hours test in four seperate files, two files minana.db and minana_2.db for 
the 10 minute average and statdat.db and stadat_2.db for the status. I 
believe there is 2 hours worth of data still missing.
Turbine no. 90, kept rebooting in the morning and I had to go to the turbine 
and restart the PC, it worked fine for the rest of the day but there is 2 
hours worth of data missing.
Other than that the data looks fine for all the rest of the turbine.
I am transfering the files right now to your folder on the transfer server, 
the folder name is SCADA ATP Trent, and also I will UPS to you by overnight 
delivery the data on a CD.
If you have any questions please feel free to call me at 661-332-6348, I will 
be in Indian Mesa site until Saturday.
Regards,
Alaadin

Tom,

I have energy estimates for May 2002 attached. Graph 1 is site totals, graph 
2 is (total lost)/(total actual production) where total actual production is 
taken from the kWh reported in the owner report, and graph 3 is the by 
turbine distribution (using box plots) of energy lost. 

The energy lost estimation method I employed is susceptible to problems with 
data recovery (10-minute data), which in May 2002 was especially poor at 
Klondike and Fenner, so those number are not as informative as those for the 
other sites. 

If these graphs provide you the information you need, I will continue with 
the remaining months (Jan - Apr). Otherwise let me know and we'll refine this 
process to get you what you need.

Mark

Gentlemen - 

Good afternoon.  I hope this email finds you well.  Just wanted to see where 
we stood with following information: 

1) Data from Germany
2) the contractual availability (soft-copy)
3) the machine availability (soft-copy)
4) the new availability number (2002) with the new definition of contractual 
availability

Thanks,
Ilan

Ilan,

Mark Walker will send a request to Germany for their availability data.  Mark 
will also provide the definitions of Machine availability.  The contractual 
availability is what was included in the memo I handed you when you were in 
my office on Wednesday.  If you need an electronic copy of that  document 
Mark can send it to you.

With respect to making us responsible (as the coordinator) for obtaining the 
Germany availability data:  We have no leverage over our European 
counterparts and cannot compel them to provide this data on a 1 day notice.  
I want to avoid setting expectations that are clearly beyond our control.  We 
will, however, give it a shot. 

I did notice the European data stops in Sep 01 so we need 6 months to fill in 
all the gaps.  Has Becky been unable to obtain any more recent data or is 
this the most current info you have?

Thanks,
Hollis

Mark,
How would the generator run if the PMT breaker tripped? Normally, CB1 will 
trip for undervolatge due to lose of power.

Subject: Re: Zilkha Availability  

To cut to the chase....would CB1 fault the turbine when the PMT breaker 
tripped and if so then would the downtime or line out time availability hour 
counter be incremented?    If the PMT breaker trip doesn't always cause a 
given fault then is there any easy way (SCADA data or site crew experience) 
for us to estimate what percentage of the trips did fault the turbine 
offlline due to a downtime or line out fault?  Please answer these 
questions;  we will then know what corrections, if any, we need to make to 
availability.

Subject: Zilkha Availability  


Joe,
Lets not forget that we had measure problems due to failing MS3 relay in the 
SEG converter, which caused the crow bar to engage, which in turn forced CB1 
to fault.

CB1 is designed to do both synchronization and was set to protect the turbine 
and the converter in a fault condition. The original instantaneous settings 
of 8000A was too high and allowed too much current through the system that 
damaged the converter and caused IGBTs to blow before it tripped. The second 
failure was due to a QA issue with failing CB1 to trip when it was commanded 
to by the converter. In both events we had catastrophic failures and lost 2 
converters due to CB1 failing to protect the system. To remedy this problem, 
we installed the PMT for CB1 redundancy and decreased the instantaneous 
setting from 8000A to 3000A and since then we didn't have any IGBT blow ups 
or any catastrophic failures

Even though that I am still not clear about Gary's question at the end, I 
hope that the above provide some help.


Thank you,

Tim M

Subject: Zilkha Availability

Kurt,
 Per our phone conversation, Mark Fisher and myself have been discussing 
availability with Gary from Zilkha. A question arose regarding the many 
operations of our breaker in the pad mounted transformer that took place 
December through March. Gary's thought is that when we recalculate the 
availability, we need to count these times as down time and not Line Out 
Hours as they have currently been counted. I suggested that according to 
Exhibit GG in the TSIA, LOH is defined in short as any time the grid does not 
meet "(i) the specifications required by the WTG as set forth in the 
Technical Specifications", and Gary agrees with this. The problem is that an 
engineering change on the breaker settings was implemented some time in March 
to reduce the number of breaker operations on site. We are still seeing many 
grid faults in the turbine but not in the PMT breaker. The question that Gary 
brought up is were the original settings of the breaker set to the WTG 
Technical Specifications and operating due to the on going grid conditions OR 
were the settings improper to start with causing the breaker to operate while 
the grid was within Technical Specifications.

availability, we need to count these times as down time and not Line Out 
Hours as they have currently been counted. I suggested that according to 
Exhibit GG in the TSIA, LOH is defined in short as any time the grid does not 
meet "(i) the specifications required by the WTG as set forth in the 
Technical Specifications", and Gary agrees with this. The problem is that an 
engineering change on the breaker settings was implemented some time in March 
to reduce the number of breaker operations on site. We are still seeing many 
grid faults in the turbine but not in the PMT breaker. The question that Gary 
brought up is were the original settings of the breaker set to the WTG 
Technical Specifications and operating due to the on going grid conditions OR 
were the settings improper to start with causing the breaker to operate while 
the grid was within Technical Specifications.

Hi Mark,

Attached are the SCADA power curve for turbine #2 and #7 at Montfort that I 
got from Joe Chapman.  The power curve for turbine #2 show a drop in power 
around 11 m/s, which is a concern.  We suspect that this turbine is not 
pitching properly and would like to compare how this turbine is pitching to 
turbine #7, which does not show this feature in its power curve.  I don't 
know if time series of pitch, wind speed (with mean wind speeds greater than 
10 m/s), and power can be easily obtained using Visu Pro, but that would be 
useful.

Also, it would be worthwile to check 5 other turbines at random from Montfort 
to see is any other turbines behave the same way as turbine #2.

Let me know if you have questions and tell me what you can provide.

Thanks,

Philippe

Mark/Terrie,

How many MB of data are being moved?  Is the slow file transfer time a new 
occurrence or has it been persistent?  

John, can your see whether there are transfer errors or if the bandwidth just 
isn't enough?

No, I don't have any other suggestions (nor have I been given any new ones). 
So continue with creating and sending disks until a reasonable method of

John,

Terrie Smith is trying to move data from the site to the transfer directory. 
This is taking an enormous amount of time (Almost 24 hours to move the files 
for 107 folders of data). Is there a better method to make the transfer? How 
can we get the data transfered quickly from that site to here?

Subject: Re: Antwort: Availability Definitions

Hello Klaus,

I am trying to do a comparison between the 1.5 MW availability definitions 
used in Germany versus the one used here in the US.  Per your attached 
e-mail, we both use the Enron Availability (EA) definition, however the 
definitions are different due to the number of available counters in the PLC 
and the placement of the "MT" term in the equations.  In Europe you are 
limited to 4 counters while the US VisuPro has 7 and in Europe you include 
the MT term in both the numerator and the denominator while in the US we only 
include it in the denominator but we deduct 4 hours per month as a 
maintenance allowance.

With respect to the timers, the differences center on how 8 status timers are 
treated which result in a slightly higher availability for US turbines given 
the same operating conditions.  The status timers are: "Overvoltage", 
"Undervoltage", "Underfrequency", "Overfrequency", "Outside Temperature too 
low", "Gear oil temp too low", "Line fault voltage" and "Line fault 
frequency".  In the European EA these values are counted as "Down Time" and 
are added in the denominator but not in the numerator resulting in a larger 
denominator and therefore a lower overall availability.  In the US EA these 
terms are added in both the denominator and the numerator thereby resulting 
in no change, either negative nor positive.

With respect to the "MT" term, the European EA includes this number in both 
the numerator and denominator which means the "MT" term does not affect 
European EA regardless of how much time a European turbine stays in 
maintenance mode.  In the US the use of the "MT" term results in a lower EA 
result for values where the maintenance time exceeds 4 hours per month (48 
hours per year).

This brings me to my questions:
1.  Do the 8 status timers result in very significant impact on the EA term 
in Germany and throughout Europe?
2.  Can you quantify, in percent EA, the impact of these 8 status timers for 
some typical turbines?
3.  Can you give me an example of how much "MT" time you accumulate in a 
month for a typical turbine?

If you have any other thoughts or ideas on how we might quantify the 
differences between the two EA definitions I would like to hear them.  

Best Regards,
Hollis

Hi Hollis,

in VisuPro we have two different calculations of "EA" = Enron Availability.

One for new VisuPro version and PLC program for USA (Montfort, Klondike, ...) 
and the other for the old VisuPro version for Europe. 





The Remote Control department use for the montly availability report to Adam 
Umanoff the calculation:


  Enron Availability: EA[%] = (SOT+ MT) / (SOT+DT+MT+RT) * 100%

 

Europe:
The running PLC program of the Bachmann controller in Europe supports only 4 
Timer:  

Timer:
System Ok Time  SOT
Down Time    DT
Maintenance Time  MT
Repair Time   RT


Survey Time (ST)  = SOT+DT+MT+RT


Availability:
Enron Availability: EA[%] = (SOT+ MT) / (SOT+DT+MT+RT) * 100%




USA:
The PLC program and VisuPro for USA supports 7 Timer:

Timer:
System Ok Time  SOT
Down Time    DT
Maintenance Time  MT
Repair Time   RT
Line Out Time    LOT
Weather Out Time  WOT
External Stop Time  EOT

Survey Time (ST)  = SOT+DT+MT+RT+LOT+WOT+EOT


Availability:
Enron Availability:  EA[%] = (SOT+LOT+WOT+EST) / (SOT+DT+LOT+WOT+EST+MT+RT) * 
100%

Hello Ule!

In the Senior Management reporting (for Adam) can you provide me a definition 
of the availability terms you propose to use?  We want to compare them to the 
definitions we are going to use to ensure that they are similar.

Right now our plan is to use the Enron Availability definition 
(SOT+LOT+WOT+EST)/(SOT+DT+LOT+WOT+EST+MT+RT) from the VisuPro system for the 
1.5 MW WTG and the Machine Availability (Op Hours/ Line Hours) for the other 
turbines.

Gentlemen

I need to know the power consumption level for the GE1.5, non cold weather.   
I heard 40kW which seems too high for the non-CWL or CWE.  It is also my 
understanding that the Eickhoff GB did not need to have the 35kW for 
lubercation (backup power issue).  

FPL is wanting to know the outcome of this issue so they can determine their 
demand charges.  Just so you know, the New Mexico project (200 mW) has a 
demand charge of $6/kW/mth so; 136 units * 40kW * $6 = $32,640/mth or 
$391,680/yr in demand charges.

Ron, Val, Jeff and Russell: 

Please read the attached test performed by Russell. He installed a calibrated 
watt/watthour meter and noted the difference between this meter and the 
turbine kWh readings. There was only 1% difference, well within the 
calibration and accuracy coefficients of the turbines metering system. 

This test confirms what we already suspected, that the turbine kWh meter is 
recording near correct. Since the values of this metering are stored in the 
Bachmann, the reporting on the VisuPro program is what is getting mixed up. 
We also know that there are problems when the metering totals are reset by 
site operators. 

Our information systems group can help with determing the nature of these 
problems, but they must be placed in the loop. They already download the raw 
kWh meter readings from the Bachmann controller and use these to determine 
actual production values. These values must be compared to the system 
metering at the substation. Both Information Services and SCADA need feedback 
from the site operators on the reading from the sub-station point-of-sale 
metering to help determine the nature of our problems, especially at Trent 
Mesa. 

Hats off to Russell for putting together this important test. 

Regards 

KLC

Hi Mark and Mark,

Over the past few weeks we have generated a list of which status counters are 
incremented during which fault/status conditions. Kim Nguyen tested all the 
fault/status conditions that she could using the EW1.5 software simulator 
(about 50% of them). Her list also includes the "theoretical" counter that is 
supposed to increment according to the specifications that we have received 
from the Scada department in Rheine.



I took that list and indexed it by counter so it show all the faults that 
actually (according to our simulation) increment a given counter. I also 
included the faults that we could not test and the counters they 
theoretically increment. 



If you have time could you please check to see that the given faults are 
incrementing the correct counters using the proper definitions of 
availability. Specifically, there are several highlighted items in the second 
document that may not be correct. We are trying to get a list back to the 
Scada group in Rheine to correct any problems with our counters and you input 
would be extremely valuable.

Thanks,

Garth

Joe,
See the file Memo0529AEP.  Is there a simple explanation for why the system 
OK counter continued to increment 44.7 hrs when the turbine blades were 
pitched out to 80 degrees?   The turbine was not powered down, put in 
maintenance, put in repair, or faulted off.   I talked to the controller 
people and the attached memo are the only commands other than manual pause 
that will cause this.  They sent me the file I stored as PausingCauses.  Call 
me at 6753 if you need any further info.


Please call me with your thoughts on this & I will finish a writeup for Gary 
Verkleeren.      Our group is working on an improved capability to detect 
periods of long pausing.   However, until the data recovery of Statdat files 
improves this new capability may not be consistently reliable or timely.

As of Noon tomorrow, July 12, the EWC network will no longer exist.  This 
means that all file servers, printers, Lotus Notes, DataFlo Abra, and 
internet access will not be available to you until Monday morning.  You will 
be able to work on files that you have saved to your local machine, however 
you will not be able to print unless you have a printer connected directly to 
your PC.  

We strongly advise that if you will need to work on files that are stored on 
the network after noon on Friday and throughout the weekend that you copy 
them from the network to your local hard drive.  Once the EWC network is cut, 
you will not be able to retrieve files until Monday morning.

If there is an urgent business need for e-mail after noon through the 
weekend, we can provide GE Outlook mail web access.  Please bear in mind that 
setting this up for you will take valuable time away from our integration 
efforts.  We ask that you do not request this service unless it is absolutely 
necessary.  

We apologize for the inconvenience, but these steps are critical to meet the 
deadline of full integration with GE Power Systems on Monday morning, July 15.

of the other two reports and delineates which turbines fall outside the 2 
sigma line for each category.  The other two reports provide more detail 
regarding the turbine performance including the degree to which a turbine 
falls outside the 2 sigma line.

Please note that we are still working with the analytic and you will find 
some extraneous characters in the results.  Please add these characters in

Subject: CPS curtailment meeting


CPS would like to meet with AEP and GE Wind to discuss curtailment 
calculations on June 24th in their offices in San Antonio.  The curtailment 
calcualtions that we have been working on will be the basis of past and 
future billings and therefore need to understand and accepted by all 
parties.   

Rich Simon plans to be available via conference call.  I would like to have a 
representative from GE Wind at the meeting if possible to answer any 
questions concerning their curtailment calculation methodology which we are 
proposing for May onward.  We will also discuss the modified method for 
handling Jan thru April curtailment estimates that Rich Simon has been 
working on to account for the missing SCADA data in the prior months 
beginning on January 11th.

Subject: DMP SPC Results

Attached please find a new Statistical Process Control analytic which 
displays the turbine performance for your site.  The report pdf is a summary 
of the other two reports and delineates which turbines fall outside the 2 
sigma line for each category.  The other two reports provide more detail 
regarding the turbine performance including the degree to which a turbine 
falls outside the 2 sigma line.

Please note that we are still working with the analytic and you will find 
some extraneous characters in the results.  Please add these characters in 
with the main group for which they are intended.  We will have them removed 
from the code next month.

Best Regards,
Hollis

Guys,

In an earlier e-mail Ben made the statement:  "Have you been able to 
determine what these numbers would look like using Vestas' definition of 
availability:  Hours of Wind Turbine in Operation mode X 100 / Hours of Grid 
in Operation Mode." 

We now need to develop a methodology to calculate the Vestas definition using 
VisuPro data.  I think this boils down to:

Vestas Avail = (SOT+WOT+EST+RT+MT)/(ST-LOT)

Where:

SOT = System Okay Time
EST = External Stop Time
WOT = Weather Out Time
LOT = Line Out Time
DT = Down Time
RT = Repair Time
MT = Maintenance Time

ST = SOT+EST+WOT+LOT+DT+RT+MT

This calculation is based on an operating assumption that the current day 
machines are placed into "pause" mode during maintenance and repair time.  As 
a result the availability counters will continue to increment even when the 
turbine is being serviced.  

Let's get together and discuss,
Hollis

Subject: Conversation with Gary

Kurt,
 As a follow up on our phone conversation, here are the main points that were 
covered in the meeting with Gary. Please let me know if there are any 
questions.

Gary was unable to find any information in the TSIA that outlined the 
procedure that we currently use to record maintenance time of 4 hours per 
month instead of recording the time as it is used. Gary had a conversation 
with Mike Kelly whom assured him that this has not been done in the past and 
seems to be an incorrect way to report the maintenance time. Gary also stated 
that this would lead to error in availability in months were there were 28 
days in the month compared to a month with 31 days

Mark Howller & Mike Kelly have also conveyed to Gary that using 10 min data 
to calculate estimated power production and availability was an industry 
standard. In an attempt to complete the sale of the site, Zilkha has been 
asked to provide 10 minute data to their potential customers. Grays questions 
is why are we not using the 10 minute data files to calculate our 
availability.

Gary also wanted to know how the Mon.db file could be more accurate then the 
Minana.db file, if the Mon.db file is taking samples from other files, and 
the other files have missing data like the Minana.db does. He also wanted to 
know how the Mon.db file could be verified if there happened to be a mistake 
as there appears to be on turbine 9 for the month of April. Where is the raw 
data proving the numbers in the Mon.db file.

We also discussed the faults on turbine 4 for the month of April. Gary stated 
that the faults he outlined in his letter came from the errordev.db file. He 
was unaware of the state of the turbine at the time of the faults or if they 
contributed to down time or not. I am researching this and will inform you as 
soon as I know.

Gary also per warned me of an Email that is planning to go out to Mike 
Miller. The letter states that over the past 6 months our turbines have 
performed poorly, and we have attempted to mislead them by over stating out 
availability. We have also misstated the amount of parts used on site and we 
have not explained problems to Zilkha, that we are experiencing with our 
turbines. He also states that we have not provided maintenance's to our 
turbines in the last 7 months.

Tom,

Attached are the graphs for energy lost due to the pitch and overspeed faults 
you listed. As I mentioned before the methodology requires decent data 
recovery for the 10-minute data. The data recovery was poor for several sites 
in January, and for Fenner and Klondike in May. 

I will be compiling a report on this request, summarizing the graph types and 
some explanation of the methods used to produce them. I hope to have that 
completed within the next couple of days.

If you see deficiencies or suggested modifications let me know.

Mark

Good news!  Please find a message from Power Systems CEO John Rice:

 Last week, I spent several days with people in Washington, D.C. and at our
Global Research Center (GRC) in Niskayuna, NY, who play large roles in
support of our growth plans.

In Washington, I visited with a number of Senators and Representatives who
are shaping energy legislation. The purpose for these meetings was to
introduce our business and to find out where we could be helpful in
providing information to support their work. I also met with Bob Card, Under
Secretary at the Department of Energy, whose office manages most of the
government funding effort in support of new energy technologies. Bob had
recently visited the GRC and commented on the outstanding work being done
there and the close collaboration that existed with GEPS.

While I was in Washington, there was yet more "swirl" coming now from
WorldCom and (even) Martha Stewart! The people I met with were very
concerned about all the recent examples of poor corporate leadership. But it
was gratifying to me to see the respect they have for GE and the reputation
for integrity that goes with our name.

I also spent a day with Jon Ebacher, Vic Abate, Scott Donnelly (leader of
the GRC), and their teams, discussing some of the great new technologies
that are making a difference for our customers today, and creating the
foundation for our future. I agree with Bob Card's assessment, and really
think that the collaboration between GEPS and the GRC is outstanding and
exemplifies the best of what we mean by "boundaryless behavior." I love the
enthusiasm that was evident in every discussion, and am particularly pleased
with the work being done to integrate our newest acquisitions - Bently
Nevada, GE Wind and PII. This is the kind of work that will separate us from
all the other companies out there that are just buying businesses to get
bigger.

Great technology and great people continue to be our most important assets.
When we get it right, we can't be beat. When we get it wrong, our customers
wonder why they cannot do business with the "six sigma" GE they read about.

Little things can go a long way toward making the large, complicated global
business that we are simpler and more "user friendly" for our customers to
work with. Customers sometimes ask us to help with problems that belong to
someone else - another person, function, or even business. In these
situations our response MUST be to make sure the problem gets quickly
communicated to the teams that can resolve it.

Believe it or not, we have had several recent examples where GE people have
responded with "it is not my department" or "try calling Jim" rather than
take the initiative themselves to help. To put it mildly, this is
unacceptable. To put it bluntly, people in customer facing positions who
respond like this will not be left in their jobs. When it comes to customer
centric behavior, everyone has to be in the game and we cannot let
"functions," "departments," or "P&L's" become barriers!

In these uncertain times, you and I should be certain of one thing, and
that's the importance of integrity. With everything going on in today's
business world, integrity must be absolute. It has to guide our
decision-making process - and ultimately defines who we are. This deeply
held value has been, and will continue to be, a cornerstone of our
competitive advantage, and every single GEPS employee in every corner of the
world has a role to play.

Finally, in a few days we will be reporting on yet another "best quarter" in
the long history of our business. Thanks to all of you for these results and
for all you are doing to help us get ready for change - and success - in the
future.

John

I have attached the curtailment log that Visupro creates.  This file is

Let me know if this is what you needed.

The curtailment program creates an additional log that is stored on the 
computer that the curtailment program is running on.

Gentlemen, I am aware that the monthly reports for the Trent Mesa and Clear 
Sky projects are forthcoming. Our customer has requested clarification 
regarding turbine performance at these two sites. Specifically, according to 
Jay Godfrey, AEP is asking why in the month of March the Trent Mesa project 
produced more energy than the Indian Mesa project. This phenomena, according 
to the customer is based on meter readings and an estimated curtailment 
number  for the month of March at Clear Sky. (Mark Fisher provided the 
curtailment number under duress) By 11:00 Tuesday AM, I need to provide 
availability and average monthly wind speed for Trent, and Clear Sky, as well 
as a firm number on curtailment at Clear Sky for the month of March.

Please understand that according to Jay Godfrey this information and our 
ability to provide it is affecting a decision on AEP's part regarding the use 
of the 1.5 on future projects. Your assistance is greatly appreciated.

Hollis - 

Thanks for the input.  I appreciate you moving forward with Germany and I 
most definitely recognize the issue concerning leverage.  Germany sometimes 
does not recognize the importance of us obtaining said data.  I am quite 
positive that Becky had an update since Sep01, but since she is out, I have 
don't have access to her source data, and not sure where she stores the 
information.  Thus, I presume the latest numbers sent from Germany should 
contain the numbers in the gap.

If you could send an electronic copy of the contractual availability, that 
would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Ilan

Mark,

A reminder to forward Dave Matson and Rich Simon the May Curtailment 
information in a format similar to Feb 02.

If you fill out the request and forward to Julie she can put a # on it.  I'm 
not sure if there was already a WR for this, but if not and we do additional 
work this new one could cover that work.

Subject: Curtailment

Matt,

Here are the direction for down loading the curtailment file on the 
curtailment computer.  We need the following file.

CURTAIL200205.DB

We will need to grab this file each month, and were planing to put together a 
SUB to document the procedure.  If you don't need a SUB let me know.  

This should be a very temporary situation since we will be pushing the 
curtailment data onto the SQL server that should be at the site next week.  I 
currently have plans to travel to the site on Wed. 26th for the morning and 
early afternoon.

Let me know if there are any questions.

The curtailment program's log file "CURTAILyyyymm.DB", is stored on the 
computer running the curtailment software.
At Desert Sky (Indian Mesa/Clear Sky) this is the second park computer.  IP 
address: 192.168.0.253
On this computer the database files is stored in "C:\Visupro\TrbCurtail\" 
folder.

Jeff Duff

Hi Erik,

I worked on this for a little while last night but I couldn't get a modem 
connection from the Hotel. I hope the timing is OK. The confirmed counters 
are highlighted in green. The counters that need to be corrected are 
highlighted in red. Most of the corrections are due to the fact that the 
fault/status messages that are the result of enabling a "manual" operation 
mode (for example, manual yaw) increment the maintenance counter not the 
"turbine OK" counter. Unfortunately, there are many faults that we could not 
confirm using the turbine simulator. If you have any questions Kim Nguyen is 
the person who did the actual testing. I forwarded the results to Mark 
Fischer and Mark Walker so they could check to see if this is the way we want 
the counters incremented for the given fault conditions but have yet to get 
any feedback. The faults that we could not test should be confirmed by 
looking at the Bachmann software. Hopefully this will occur in the near 
future. For now, this is the best information we have.

Please be advised.  The VisuPro download to cd for June SCADA data should be 
done on Monday, July 1 and sent to Tehachapi as "Next Day Delivery." 

The files needed for monthly reporting are similar to the Wednesday download 
including Zmet if available.
Please include the Mon0207.db file if it is available.

To support the data storage of ZMET data here is a proposal for what the 
table structure should be.  In addition, after discussing the status messages 
it is important to differentiate between those which effect availability and 
those that do not.  The FAULTS table includes a flag field INCLUDE which 
serves this purpose for STAR. 

A improvement to this table would be to add a counter description field 
var(4) which would hold one of the following descriptions; SOT, LOT, DT, WOT, 
MT, RT, and EST.  This will allow us do differentiate status messages by 
which counter they are associated with.

Since the intent is to mirror the SQL Server and the STAR db we need to make 
these changes to both.  I'd like to get the SQL server changes ASAP so I can 
develop some additional reports.

Let me know what you think

JD

Hollis - 

Per the phone conversation earlier today, below is a chart exhibiting the 
differences between the Monthly Operational Report (Mark Fisher) and the 
Weekly MTD (John Ruiz) numbers posted on the web.  Both cases should include 
the numbers through the end of the month.  From what we discussed, my 
understanding is that the chart should pool from the same source.  Please let 
me know if I am viewing this information incorrectly.

Thanks,

Bo and Klaus, Ward Marshall is now asking for January data at Clear Sky. If 
you recall, Mark Fisher and Matthew Meyers put together the wind and turbine 
performance data for Feb. and we sent that to Ward last week. There are going 
to be a couple of issues with providing this data for Jan.
The data collection for the turbines was less reliable in January.
The wind data should be OK, Matthew?
The curtailment data is going to be sorely lacking, during the month of 
January we were only tracking the time and I believe the number of turbines 
off-line during curtailments, not the specific wtg's off-line due to 
curtailment. This going to make the actual lost energy calculation much more 
difficult and open to question.

Mark and Matthew are going to get started on this asap, I would suggest that 
Bo, Klaus and myself discuss this issue on Friday AM.

Attached please find a new Statistical Process Control analytic which 
displays the turbine performance for your site.  The report pdf is a summary 
of the other two reports and delineates which turbines fall outside the 2 
sigma line for each category.  The other two reports provide more detail 
regarding the turbine performance including the degree to which a turbine 
falls outside the 2 sigma line.

Please note that we are still working with the analytic and you will find 
some extraneous characters in the results.  Please add these characters in 
with the main group for which they are intended.  We will have them removed 
from the code next month.

Best Regards,

Mark: 

The initial testing was delayed due to not being able to get Garrad Hassan 
inspector on site in time. I will let you know but I was told that we would 
proceed during the week of March 11 through 15. 

The second stage of testing is to be completed prior to April 19. We are 
working on a tentative date of March 25 and 26. I will also let you know in

The Visupro curtailment log file "Curtail.db", is stored in the turbine data 
folder at each turbine.
At turbine "840006003" the database files would be in "C:\Visupro\840006003\"
At turbine "840006020" the database files would be in "C:\Visupro\840006020\"

The curtailment program's log file "CURTAILyyyymm.DB", is stored on the

Joe,

I know you told me where these files are, but could you spell it out for me 
so we can issue a SUB for an additional download.

I think we will want to download both the Curtail.db file logged for each 
turbine and the monthly curtail file logged by the curtailment software.

FYI,
Fenner Turbine 17 mon0205:
There is a gap occuring for this turbine from 5/16 to 5/21 approximate
I have downloaded Mon files from Fenner using VisuPro remote. And it looks 
like a successful upload
to STAR for the rest of the turbines.
That is all.

FYI,  this email is to provide a concise summary of data loading requirements 
and doesn't replace the main spreadsheet.

We don't have a Paradox Mon0205 file for Montfort, Fenner, and Desert Sky 
that contain the entire month.   John, please call the Regional Managers to 
have them send the files if they aren't already in transit.  They are very 
late and delaying completion of Owner Reporting.   If they are in transit 
then these are the highest priority Visupro data issue.    

Trent, Mill Run, and Somerset have complete Mon0205 Paradox files on the 
network but aren't completely loaded into STAR.  

Klondike Mon0205 is fully loaded into STAR and therefore no further action is 
required for data loading.

Ilan,

In order to calculate the VA we need the actual VisuPro counter data since we 
are using an assumed formula for the Vestas Availability.  (See attached for 
this year 2002 VA):



Note this report was an interim report and the "EA" values used for 
comparison does include the 90 day ramp up time and the Trent leaning towers.

With regard to the German turbines: If the German team has summarized data 
then we could make the calculation, with some simplifying assumptions, for 
the year 2001 on the German turbines and extend the graph.  By summarized 
data I am talking about a summation of each of the counter values for all of 
their turbines for all of the months during last year.  (This is not totally 
unreasonable, we could provide this data for turbines in the US very quickly 
but that is because we have the data in an Oracle database.)  

If, however, the data comes to us as individual VisuPro files it would be 
impossible to assimilate and produce the report before AWEA.  In fact I would 
not recommend trying to produce this number even after AWEA because of the 
complexity of the process.

We will pose the question to the German team but I am not optimistic that 
they have summarized counter data.

Best Regards,
Hollis


*  One simplifying assumption goes back to the fact the European VisuPro 
SCADA system has 4 counters which are defined differently than the 7 US 
counters.  We would need to assume the German grid never went down and was 
always available.  If we were unable to make this assumption then we would 
need to load all the error messages from each individual turbine in Germany 
and isolate the time associated with grid events (i.e. error messages 8 
Overvoltage 9 "Undervoltage", 10 "Underfrequency", 11 "Overfrequency", 116 
"Line fault voltage", 117 "Line fault frequency") and back that time out of 
RT and apply it to SOT.

Subject: Re: April Availability  

Ben - 

Two issues remain, in order to graph the data as you requested:

1) 2001 Vestas Availability would need to be calculated,

2) We don't have the VA calculation for Germany, only the US. 

I will put a graph together, nonetheless.

Hollis -  Is it possible to get the two questions above answered?  

Thanks,
Ilan

Profile likelihood would work well here.  Because the conditional mle
for the scale parameter, given the shape parameter, has a closed-form
expression you can evaluate the profile log-likelihood for the shape
parameter explicitly.

I used this as an example in a presentation at the recent Joint
Statistical Meetings on "Using Open Source Software to Teach
Mathematical Statistics".  (As you might guess from the title, I was
primarily discussing another implementation of the S language but the
examples work - with minor modifications - in S-PLUS.)  The PDF file for
the presentation is available as
http://www.stat.wisc.edu/~bates/JSM2001.pdf
Look especially at slide 26 where the profile log-likelihood function
for the shape parameter is defined as
> profilell <- function(alpha)
+    -sum(dweibull(xmp04.30$lifetime, shape = alpha,
+         scale = mean(xmp04.30$lifetimealpha)(1/alpha), log = TRUE))
> profilell(2.15)   # negative profile log-likelihood at estimate
[1] 77.0951
> mle3 <- nlm(profilell, c(alpha = 1.0), hessian = TRUE)
> unlist(mle3[-3])
minimum   estimate    hessian       code iterations
77.095088   2.152001   3.378437   1.000000   7.000000
(This is R, not S-PLUS.  In S-PLUS I think you must evaluate dweibull
without log = TRUE then take the log of the result and you would use
ms rather than nlm.)

Using the approximate distribution of twice the change in the profile
log-likelihood as a chi-square with 1 df (at least I think that is the
correct formula), you can construct confidence limits.

The 3.8 hours was added to the January and not Febuary OH term for WTG 11.   
The 3.8 hours was added back because the Emergency Oil Loss was interpreted 
by me to be a failure not directly due to the icing.  Icing alone shouldn't 
cause an emergency oil loss.  I Added it back in to prevent double counting 
of the turbine offlline.  If  the oil loss indication was directly due to 
icing then we should lower the MAA availability for turbine 11 in January to 
correct for 3.8 hours.   Let me know what you want us to do.  

For the future, we analysts will always assume that a failure that occurs 
during icing and that isn't reasonably due to icing alone will be treated as 
a separate (independent) failure.   Please  indicate clearly in the manual 
log that a turbine failure (or apparent failure) was directly related to 
icing or other cause if the failure  isn't obviously expected due to icing 
alone.  Breakage of anemometer cups is an example of a failure that would 
clearly be expected as a result of icing alone.

Mark, you stated 3.8 hours was added to the OH hours of turbine #11 at the 
bottom of the OH calculations sheet. I believe this was added because the 
Emergency Oil Level Fault was not reset on that machine because of the icing 
conditions we were experiencing at the time. Is this correct?

Ron,

The data for the Trent ATP is being uploaded and I have taken a quick look. 
For the data already uploaded 24,25, and 27 don't look good for the 24 hour 
period. I will look for a previous 24 hour period for just those turbines 
(though that does not seem to be valid in the context of the test). For 
turbines 31 and 90 I will do the same otherwise the loss of 2 hours of data 
will drop the recovery  to 92%.

Here are some graphs to look at. Our data loading priority is changing and 
that could affect how fast the remaining data will be uploaded.

Hi Mark,
I did the ATP for SCADA system in Trent on April 13th at 11:40am (CT) 4:40pm 
(UTC), it lasted for 24hours. I collected the database files from all the 
turbines.
The following is the observations for the data collected:
Turbines no. 47 & 48 were under major repairs and were not included on the 
ATP, so total number if turbines is 98..
During the night of the test turbines no. 24,25, & 27 stopped collecting 
data, and I reset Visupro application in the morning, so there is a 10 hours 
worth of data lost, I suggest we shift the starting time of the test for only 
these turbines so we can get 24hours of data.
Turbine no. 31 has some repairs done to it during the night of the test and I 
didn't have notice of these repairs, I managed to capture the data for the 
24hours test in four seperate files, two files minana.db and minana_2.db for 
the 10 minute average and statdat.db and stadat_2.db for the status. I 
believe there is 2 hours worth of data still missing.
Turbine no. 90, kept rebooting in the morning and I had to go to the turbine 
and restart the PC, it worked fine for the rest of the day but there is 2 
hours worth of data missing.
Other than that the data looks fine for all the rest of the turbine.
I am transfering the files right now to your folder on the transfer server, 
the folder name is SCADA ATP Trent, and also I will UPS to you by overnight 
delivery the data on a CD.
If you have any questions please feel free to call me at 661-332-6348, I will 
be in Indian Mesa site until Saturday.
Regards,
Alaadin

Mark,

We may get a comment on the page 1 footnote 1 regarding "information not 
being available".  Did you check with Engineering SCADA for this information?

If you did then please put a note to that effect and send it on to Jeff 
Ghilardi.

Thanks,
Hollis

the correlations went down (in magnitude, they remained negative), though one 
was statistically significant.

Gary, thank you very much for your feedback. I apologize for the content of 
the reports sent to you yesterday. With respect to the content of those 
reports, it is obvious that more work is required on our part. We will 
expedite that process and provide revised reports once again as soon as 
possible. I promise you that Joe Thorpe, Jeff Duff, Mark Fisher, and myself 
will perform a thorough review of the new data set prior to distribution.

The May monthly report which was sent to your attention earlier today, was 
delayed at my request to ensure that the correct methodology was utilized 
when calculating availability, at this time further revisions to that report 
may be required. In the future, Jeff Duff and I will ensure that the monthly 
reports are delivered as contractually required. 

Regards

KA

> After performing an initial review of the revised availability numbers, 
which included performing spot checks on specific turbines, I have decided to 
discontinue any additional efforts on my part to validate the revised

following:
>

states:

>  "To differentiate for times when the turbine is transitioning between 
states as per design, calculations have determined that during each month a 
turbine will have  between one and two hours meeting the above conditions.  
For this reason, the times determined using the conditions above (i.e. "zero 
power availability") were  decreased by 1.5 hours to account for the as 
designed transitioning times."
>
>     I reject applying this rule.  A turbine is available to run or it is 
not available to run.  If a turbine remains down on repair for seven 
consecutive days its availability for  that seven day period is zero.  No 
credit should be applied for as designed transitioning times - at least this 
is how I interpret the contract.
>
> 2) On May 23, 2002 you received an email from me regarding the April 
Monthly Reports.  My email to you made specific reference to MR WTG#9 and its 
improperly  reported  availability.  On June 13, 2002, Mark Fisher, Joe 
Thorpe and I spent the entire day reviewing the availability calculation 
procedures, methodology, and  reporting.  MR WTG#9 happened to be a specific 
turbine in which we worked through the entire availability calculation.  Both 
Mark Fisher and Joe Thorpe agreed that  the reported availability was 
incorrect by approximately 5 percentage points.  Why was MR WTG#9 not revised 
for the month of April?
>
> 3) Your summary letter mentions low data recovery of 10-minute data for the 
December 01 time period.  Based on my understanding from Mark Fisher, the Mon 
files
>  form the basis for your availability reporting.  My availability analysis 
which primarily included investigation of the 10-minute data was frowned upon 
by Hollis  Kimbrough and he mentioned several problems with my method. He 
stated that the Mon files have a much higher data recovery rate. Did the 
10-minute data form  the basis for your revised availability tables?
>
> 4) In addition to MR WTG#9 as mentioned above, I have internal 
documentation that suggests that the revised availability percentage on MR 
WTG#2 for the month of  February remains on the order of 3 to 4 percentage 
points high.
>
> I recommend performing a more thorough review of the available information 
including SCADA files, maintenance records, and repair logs and then 
revisiting the recently reported numbers.  Please recall that I am requesting 
actual turbine availabilities uncorrected for maintenance allowances.  The 
revised numbers make no distinction.  I am also in need of complete monthly 
reports for both PA projects for the month of May which should have been 
received by June 20th.

We need to prepare an SUB to change the downloading requirement for the

Executive Summary
Marion Horna and Kurt Anderson requested an explanation of how the EW 1.5 
Availability was computed.  In addition,  Barry Riffe and Jeff Duff have 
expressed concerns that there is confusion between the EW 750 owners, I.E., 
and EWC on how to categorize (OOH, UAH, or other) the direction curtailment & 
windshear curtailment for availability computations.   The attached memo is 
the result of a throrough review of the Exhibits in the 1.5 contracts that 
define availability and the UAH & OOH clauses which are similar between 1.5 
and 750 project contracts.  This memo doesn't include a thorough review of 
the Technical Specs or Germainisher Lloyd design recommendations for 1.5 
projects.  This draft memo proposes that:

 1)  EWC should not be penalized for direction curtailment and windshear 
curtailment losses to availability IF that curtailment is in accordance with 
 the Tech Spec of Germanischer Lloyd recommendations or requirements.   
Neither the UAH term or the OOH term in the contract apply.  
 The corrections applied to correct for windshear in previous EW 750 reports 
were made to compensate for the limitations of controller counters.

 2) Only those Offline Hrs ordered  by the organizations specifically 
mentioned in the OOH clause in the contract should be included in the OOH 
term in 
 the contract.  For example, if the owner is not specifically mentioned in 
the OOH clause then their orders for offline turbine should not be included in
 OOH.

The availability resulting from this computation will not penalize 
availability for all reasons that the turbine didn't produce power in good 
winds.  There will be events that prevent turbine production but do not lower 
availability, ie.  high winds, direction curtailment.

Gary,

I apologize for the delay, our goal is to provide validated data for the 
January through May period by Wednesday, July 10th. At my request, upon Mark 
Fisher's return from the meetings at Mill Run, the Data Analysis group has 
been working toward this goal at the expense of getting the May report 
completed. My intent was to avoid any doubts about the methodology utilized 
on the availability calculation for the May report. If you agree, GEWE will 
forward the Jan. through May data to you no later than Wednesday, and 
schedule a conference call for Friday, July 12th to discuss the reports 
further.

Please let me know if this schedule is acceptable.

Regards,

Kurt

Mill Run ErrDev is loaded.

The following Turbines are missing:

Jan 22 - #1
Jan 24 - #7
Feb 11 - #1, 5, 9
Feb 8 - #4

Turbine #8 for all of January and most of February had to be rebuilt.  The 
most recent ErrDev files from Turbine #8 are good so the problem has been 
corrected.

Do you know how often we need to download the Z-Met data?  In other words, 
what are the file characteristics?  Do they overwrite every 3.4 days, are 
they a data stack which has 1000 records, etc.

Guys

Attached is an update/reconciliation of the March numbers for Trent and Clear 
Sky.  As you can see the predicted wind energy, based on the actual wind 
speeds for the month, is approximately 20% higher for Trent than it is for 
Clear Sky.  This was a result of the average wind speeds (see monthly 
reports) being 14% higher at Trent: 7.69 m/s vs. 8.8 m/s.  Note that the 
power as wind speeds increase skews the variance in energy higher than the 
variance in wind speeds.

Of particular interest please note that the final curtailment figure has been 
computed and has increased to 11.29 GWh vs. the preliminary numbers of 7.9 
GWh.  

I hope that this helps, please call me with any questions.

Subject: CLear Sky/Trent Comparison






Explainations:

Predicted: For each 10 minute interval and each turbine the wind speed was 
converted to a power. The power for each 10 minute interval was then 
averaged, to produce a mean power for the site. This number was then scaled 
by the number of turbines to produce a site wide power value, that value was 
then converted to an energy value.

Curtailment: Curtailment logs were provided by the site giving the turbine 
number and the start and stop time of the curtailment. For each curtailment 
period the wind speed was found. Due to the fact that wind speeds are lower 
on non-producing turbines, the wind speed was scaled up by approximately 5%. 
This wind speed was then converted to power, and then energy. The value of 
the curtailment number is the sum for all curtailments. 

Unavailable: The Curtailment value was removed from the predicted production 
and the result multiplied by the site availability.

Difference: This is a sum total, removing the Curtailment and unavailable 
from the predicted.

Line loss: This is 98% of the Difference to estimate a 2% line loss.

Net: Is the difference of Difference and line loss.

Actual: Is taken directly from the Substation

Variance: Is the difference between the Net and Actual



Curtailed production: Is the amount of  energy not produced due to 
curtailment.
97% Availability: Is 97% of the curtailed production.
2% line loss: Is 98% of the value in 97% availability

Billable Curtailment: Is the value for Curtailment after both availability 
and line loss are taken into account.

Hollis,

Mark Fisher pulled up the original SUB 352-C, which defined the what and when 
for Zmet files.

At the time we did not have a complete information chain.  In my 
conversations with Garth (just confirmed), these two files are not 
overwritten and remain on the HD until deleted.  Therefor we have access to 
daily files for each day/month, and one monthly file.  When the rollover 
occurs, a new file name is started and the process starts again.

So, we could modify the current SUB to include only a monthly download and be 
more specific on where/how to store the files.  Currently these files are 
written into a MET folder under the Plant PC the Zmet is attached to in the 
field.  The downloads we receive sometimes separate out this directory so it 
appears on the Plant directory level, other times it is left as a 
sub-directory under the turbine Plant directory it is attached to.

Hope this helps

-JD

Jeff,

Do you know how often we need to download the Z-Met data?  In other words, 
what are the file characteristics?  Do they overwrite every 3.4 days, are 
they a data stack which has 1000 records, etc.

Thanks,

We need to prepare an SUB to change the downloading requirement for the

Can we meet in the morning sometime to discuss?

We now have the curtailment piece but what about the energy which was in the 
wind (i.e. what was possible)?

Subject: Clear Sky March 2002 curtailment

Kurt,

The March data has been uploaded ( 443663 of a possible 473184 or 93.8% 
recovery, which is better than I expected). Running the nacelle wind speed 
data through the power curve for the curtailed periods as supplied by the 
site shows that approximately  9,961,285 kWh was lost due to curtailment 
(taking into account 97% availability and a 2% line loss). Additional losses 
might have occured during the times of no recovered data, but that is not 
supported by this data set/methodology.

The spreadsheet for each turbine/time period is attached (Times in this 
spreadsheet are SCADA time, UTC).

Ben, 

Rick Winsor's note below has prompted me to provide a timeline with regards 
to the issue of Zilka's concerns with our Availability calculations.

5/2/02
Rick Winsor states on a Mill Run noise issue conference call that Gary 
Verkleeren has "scrubbed the data" from the Jan thru March time period and 
arrived at a 92% to 93% availability figure. Rick also states that SCADA and 
operational procedures have inflated availability.
While on the conf call, I stated that we would be very interested seeing the 
data as well as the methodology utilized by Zilkha to arrive  at these 
numbers and that we would work diligently to resolve the discrepancy between 
our numbers and theirs.  Rick replied that the information would be sent 
soon. Michael Miller, Michael Payne and Tom Nemila were participants on the 
call.     
5/15/02
Kurt Anderson sent an e-mail to Gary V. requesting the information regarding 
the availability and reiterating our desire to resolve this issue.
Gary V. replied with the data and a copy of a letter he sent to Rick W. that 
outlined the methodology utilized in Zilkha's calculations. 
Gary V's e-mail stated that he wanted to review the data with Joe Thorpe to 
"explain the basis and reasoning applied to the calculations" with the intent 
that Joe would then share this information with Tehachapi.
Upon receipt of the data I immediately forwarded this info to Hollis 
Kimbrough and requested that he review it and provide comments to Joe, in 
order to prepare Joe for his meeting with Gary. Hollis responded with an 
e-mail to Joe dated 5/16/02 in which he clearly indicates his concerns with 
the methodology utilized by Zilkha. Additionally, Hollis and Joe spoke at 
length regarding this issue.
5/21/02
Joe T and Gary V. met and reviewed Zilkha's availability calcs, during this 
meeting Joe T outlined our concerns with Gary's logic and  methodology. While 
in the meeting, according to Joe, Gary V stated that he may have made some 
errors and that he wanted to recalculate the availability. This was the last 
word Joe heard from Gary V regarding this subject.
5/23/02 Rick Winsor sends the note in which states that we "shrug off their 
inquiries", to Michael Zilkha, who then forwards it to Steve Zwolinski, 
Colleen Repplier and you.

I wanted to thank all three of you for coming to meet with us this morning. 
It is very exciting to have GE in this business. I am forwarding the 
following e-mail since I thought you would want to know what the feelings 
currently are in the trenches at Zilkha in terms of the PA projects. The 
projects were commissioned six months ago so I can understand the frustration.

We look forward to seeing you at AWEA and to a long and fruitful relationship.

With best wishes,

Kurt,

I have a few questions relating to the Monthly Reports prepared for the Mill 
Run and Somerset Wind Farms.  They are as follows:

* On April 5th the Main Circuit Breaker located within the pad mounted 
transformer on WTG#7 at Mill Run was torn apart and replaced by Marvin Blanco 
(GE Turbine Tech.).  In addition, on or about this same date IGBT's were 
replaced within the same turbine.  Nowhere in the Monthly report are these 
issues mentioned, please explain?

* WTG#9 at Mill Run experienced downtime between 4-17-02 at 10:00 A.M. and 
4-24-02 at 4:00 P.M. this equates to 7 days - 6 hrs. or 7.25 days.  Assuming 
WTG#7 operated fault free the entire month (its availability at 100%) except 
for the above mentioned period of 7.25 days, the best possible availability 
that could be realized would be            (1-(7.25/30) x 100) = 75.8%.  
Please explain how the availability of this turbine can be 78.6% as listed in 
the Monthly Report?

* On 4-25-02 WTG#8 experienced several hours of repair time due to worn HV 
cable which had been rubbing against the ladder rungs at the yaw deck level.  
Apparently, the bundle of cables sways or moves during normal operation and 
over an extended period it caused significant wear to the protective 
coating/insulation.  Why was this not mentioned?  Are other turbines 
experiencing this problem?  Is there a retrofit being considered?

* On 4-28-02 a storm event with heavy winds rolled through the area.  
Turbines #2, #3, and #8 at Mill Run all experienced faults requiring 
component replacements.  The Summary on individual turbine activity in the 
monthly report does not reflect this, neither does the Consumption Log also 
contained within the Monthly Report, please explain?  In fact, WTG#8 required 
a new rack of IGBT's as a result of this storm event and no mention is made 
in the report to an IGBT replacement for this turbine.  Furthermore, on 
4-30-02 a new rack of IGBT's was installed in WTG#8 and they were blown upon 
start up.  IGBT's are major components, As a minimum I would expect the 
monthly reports to include major component failures/replacements.

* I need clarification on what exactly Section 7. EXHIBITS is attempting to 
demonstrate.  Surely, this is not an attempt to list all faults that a 
turbine experienced for the current month.  How are you selecting the faults 
you choose to include on the list?  For example, WTG#4 lists one (1) fault 
for the month and clearly that was not the case.  As one example, check the 
operational activity for WTG#4 on 4-22-02 where it experienced multiple 
faults among them "Gearbox Oil Pressure Too Low."

We have to have a better account of the operational history of these wind 
farms through GE Wind Monthly Reports.  I understand that the company as a 
whole has been consumed with many other tasks relating to the recent 
acquisition and that your attention has been elsewhere.  Nevertheless, we 
need to work together in order to improve the accuracy and attention to 
important details that is lacking within these reports.

I look forward to working with you and Joe to make these projects better and 
more accountable.

Best Regards,

Gary

On Sunday, April 7 2002 at 2am, Daylight Savings Time begins.
Please ensure your windfarm is in the following configuration.

Plant PCs should have "Automatically adjust clock for daylight saving 
changes" NOT checked
 - Double-click on time in lower right corner of Plant PC to verify/configure
 - During site commissioning, all WTGs should have been configured for NOT 
checked.

Park PC should have "Automatically adjust clock for daylight saving changes" 
NOT checked
 - Double-click on time in lower right corner of PC  to verify/configure
 - During site commissioning, Park PCs should have been configured for NOT 
checked.

Required Action
Park PC must be manually adjusted for the time change.

Time synch program must be running from Park PC.
 - Reference SUB 374, distributed in February 2002.
 - Note:  Time synch program must be manually restarted any time the Park PC 
re-boots.



Discussion
The Time synch program will synchronize all WTG PCs
The Time synch program runs on the Park PC
The Park PC must NOT be set to automatically adjust for Daylight Savings time 
because this will cause the Time synch program to send the incorrect time to 
the WTGs (This is because Microsoft Windows uses Greenwhich Mean time and 
converts to local time, including Daylight Savings)

Time-synch must not be checked at Plant or Park because a Windows prompt 
appears at 2am April 7 asking if automatic update to Daylight Savings Time is 
OK.  This prompt requires a person to manually respond.  If the PC re-boots 
before the manual response, the PC will not complete its boot process because 
it is again waiting for a manual response to the prompt.  This means that 
VisuPro will not start, and will not collect WTG data from the Bachmann.

Verification of Plant PCs  "Automatically adjust clock for daylight saving 
changes" NOT checked can be performed from the Park PC after 2am April 7.  
Look at the WTG time on the Network Overview screen.  Any WTGs that are one 
hour different require configuration at the WTG.

If questions, contact Ron Brzezinski, Joe Chapman, or Alaadin Suliman.

Thank you.

Ron

Here is the latest version. It only uses periods past the 90 day ramp up and 
removes leaning turbines. I have made one other change to the code. I 
discovered one case where the survey time was over 3000 hours, so I added 
code to remove all cases where the ST was greater than 1.10*Actual Survey. I 
have added a paragraph explaining these qualifiers.

Do you know of any information/analysis we have collected on the Trent and 
Desert Sky sites?  I know that we were collecting data from GA, but Matt was

1.  We have not received the European data yet.

2.  The data does include the first 90 days in both the EA and the VA.  We 
can exclude the first 90 days if that is desirable.

Looks good.  Now lets see if we get some comments from some other people.  A 
couple of questions:

1) Does this mean you have the April data for Europe as well, if so please 
send them?

2) According to our calculation of EA, the first 90 days should not be 
included.  Is that how the document was calculated?

To cut to the chase....would CB1 fault the turbine when the PMT breaker 
tripped and if so then would the downtime or line out time availability hour 
counter be incremented?    If the PMT breaker trip doesn't always cause a 
given fault then is there any easy way (SCADA data or site crew experience) 
for us to estimate what percentage of the trips did fault the turbine 
offlline due to a downtime or line out fault?  Please answer these 
questions;  we will then know what corrections, if any, we need to make to 
availability.

Subject: Zilkha Availability  


Joe,
Lets not forget that we had measure problems due to failing MS3 relay in the 
SEG converter, which caused the crow bar to engage, which in turn forced CB1 
to fault.

CB1 is designed to do both synchronization and was set to protect the turbine 
and the converter in a fault condition. The original instantaneous settings 
of 8000A was too high and allowed too much current through the system that 
damaged the converter and caused IGBTs to blow before it tripped. The second 
failure was due to a QA issue with failing CB1 to trip when it was commanded 
to by the converter. In both events we had catastrophic failures and lost 2 
converters due to CB1 failing to protect the system. To remedy this problem, 
we installed the PMT for CB1 redundancy and decreased the instantaneous 
setting from 8000A to 3000A and since then we didn't have any IGBT blow ups 
or any catastrophic failures

Even though that I am still not clear about Gary's question at the end, I 
hope that the above provide some help.


Thank you,

Tim M

Subject: Zilkha Availability

Kurt,
 Per our phone conversation, Mark Fisher and myself have been discussing 
availability with Gary from Zilkha. A question arose regarding the many 
operations of our breaker in the pad mounted transformer that took place 
December through March. Gary's thought is that when we recalculate the 
availability, we need to count these times as down time and not Line Out 
Hours as they have currently been counted. I suggested that according to 
Exhibit GG in the TSIA, LOH is defined in short as any time the grid does not 
meet "(i) the specifications required by the WTG as set forth in the 
Technical Specifications", and Gary agrees with this. The problem is that an 
engineering change on the breaker settings was implemented some time in March 
to reduce the number of breaker operations on site. We are still seeing many 
grid faults in the turbine but not in the PMT breaker. The question that Gary 
brought up is were the original settings of the breaker set to the WTG 
Technical Specifications and operating due to the on going grid conditions OR 
were the settings improper to start with causing the breaker to operate while 
the grid was within Technical Specifications.

Clemens,

I agree. for our immediate needs, we will only have to address the four 
tables listed below. There is a view that joins the VISU_MINANAMAIN and 
VISU_MINANAEXT that you can load data against.

As I mentioned in an earlier letter, the SITE_ID field is to allow multiple 
sites to be housed in a single database. We can handle this in three ways
create a database trigger that automatically fills this field or
load a value from each turbine (you do it)
eliminate this filed. I would do this only if we will not put more than one 
site in a single database.

the DTTM field was added to the KEY value because the "Plant Index" number 
repeats under certain conditions. This eliminates the potential for key 
violations

the ID field is directly from the raw data

the PLANT_NDX field id the "Plant Index" number mentioned above directly from 
the raw data

the TRBN_ROW_OTM field should be removed. This was poor design on our part.

all other fields are directly from the raw data. Mark Fisher should be able 
to provide the remaining field mappings.

I hope this makes the task clearer

Thanks

David Miller

production data.  We will be discussing showing this method may be 
appropriate to use for future calculation with the June data, which would 
give CPS the ability to preforme the calculations themselves.

Jan. 02


Feb 02



Jeff......Can you add the Jan and Feb 15 min (97% availability) curtailment
estimates to the May Monthly Status Report and resubmit it to me and Terri
McCastlain by noon EST today if possible.

Ward and Jeff:
I have created a new worksheet, with curtailment losses, based on the
outage list and ERCOT 15-min data. ?This the same as I had done for Feb,
with the addition of Jan.
Note that the ERCOT data includes the line losses of about 2%, but
assumes 100% turbine availability, so I have added the total lines at
the top of the worksheet, with both 100% availability and 97%
availability.
Hope this is helpful,

There are several ambiguities and operational issues with this definition.   

SOT:  First, the phrase "available to operate without a status condition or 
fault that would otherwise limit its operation" in SOT is very easily 
misunderstood.  Many owners & I.E.'s think that "System Okay" means the 
turbine should produce power, as per the power curve,  during every second of 
SOT.  This isn't true.    If the turbine is paused offline or manually 
stopped, untwisting cables, resetting, undergoing a load shutdown,  in low 
noise operation, or  in spinning or starting up mode, then the SOT clock is 
incremented even though the turbine can't produce power.  I think the SOT 
description should read something like"not faulted off for turbine 
malfunction or offline for failed turbine systems."  Either that or call this 
counter something other than "System Okay".   

DT:  The phrase "or that is counted as Weather Out Time" may confuse the 
owner.  According to SCADA training if a downtime fault occurs at the same 
time as a "weather out" condition then the turbine fault (DT) will have 
precedence.    This precedence may be hard to explain to owner.  Therefore, I 
recommend you delete the Weather out phrase.  In other words, stop the 
sentance on Majeure Events.

LOT:   Precedence also can cause confusion here.  If a turbine fault occurs 
when the grid is outside of specs we've been told that DT will always take 
precedence whether the grid induced the fault or the fault occurred due to 
turbine malfunction not related to the grid.  How does the controller 
distinguish (and analysts from ten minute SCADA data) whether the fault was 
due to the grid or the grid was driven out of spec by a turbine malfunction?  
I recommend that you replace the phrase "except where line conditions are 
forced out of specs due to Turbine malfunction" with " except when the 
turbine faults offline."  Further, it should be noted that when the turbine 
faults off due to grid variations then it probably is true that EWC is 
penalized for the grid variations.   

MT:  How do we implement the 36 hour limit on MT in the equation?  I assume 
that we compute a value MTexcess that is that portion of MT in excess of the 
36 hour limit.   Then we use MTexcess in the numerator instead of MT to 
penalize EWC for exceeding the MT limit.   Where did 36 hours come from?   
The previous limit in all existing 1.5 contracts is 48 hours and MT, as 
defined by the controller fault listing, includes several other tasks that 
are not on a scheduled maintenance  checklist.   The 48 hours per year was 
intended only to capture those tasks on the maintenance checklist.

WOT:  How does the controller know when the turbine can't be repaired due to 
weather related events or that weather makes access unsafe?   If it can't 
then you are adding an activity that must be tracked by manual log and 
integrated into availability computations by a manual procudure that is not 
value added to the customer and costly to operator.

EOT:  What about icing sensor shutting down turbine?   This isn't due to 
Owner.   

ST:  This definition of ST rarely equals the total number of hours in the  
"survey or measurement" period  due to communication losses and power 
outages.   I recommend you  remove that phrase from the definition OR alter 
the definition of availability to (SURVEY - DT - RT - MT)/(SURVEY - 
MTprorated).    SURVEY is the maximum possible number of hours in the survey 
period and MTprorated is the percent of 36 hours per year in the survey 
period.  I recommend keeping the current availability definition as it uses 
info already in Visupro. 

Availability equation as shown doesn't penalize EWC for MT above the 36 hour 
limit.   See MT above for solution.

Subject: Conversation with Gary

Kurt,
 As a follow up on our phone conversation, here are the main points that were 
covered in the meeting with Gary. Please let me know if there are any 
questions.

Gary was unable to find any information in the TSIA that outlined the 
procedure that we currently use to record maintenance time of 4 hours per 
month instead of recording the time as it is used. Gary had a conversation 
with Mike Kelly whom assured him that this has not been done in the past and 
seems to be an incorrect way to report the maintenance time. Gary also stated 
that this would lead to error in availability in months were there were 28 
days in the month compared to a month with 31 days

Mark Howller & Mike Kelly have also conveyed to Gary that using 10 min data 
to calculate estimated power production and availability was an industry 
standard. In an attempt to complete the sale of the site, Zilkha has been 
asked to provide 10 minute data to their potential customers. Grays questions 
is why are we not using the 10 minute data files to calculate our 
availability.

Gary also wanted to know how the Mon.db file could be more accurate then the 
Minana.db file, if the Mon.db file is taking samples from other files, and 
the other files have missing data like the Minana.db does. He also wanted to 
know how the Mon.db file could be verified if there happened to be a mistake 
as there appears to be on turbine 9 for the month of April. Where is the raw 
data proving the numbers in the Mon.db file.

We also discussed the faults on turbine 4 for the month of April. Gary stated 
that the faults he outlined in his letter came from the errordev.db file. He 
was unaware of the state of the turbine at the time of the faults or if they 
contributed to down time or not. I am researching this and will inform you as 
soon as I know.

Gary also per warned me of an Email that is planning to go out to Mike 
Miller. The letter states that over the past 6 months our turbines have 
performed poorly, and we have attempted to mislead them by over stating out 
availability. We have also misstated the amount of parts used on site and we 
have not explained problems to Zilkha, that we are experiencing with our 
turbines. He also states that we have not provided maintenance's to our 
turbines in the last 7 months.

Hello Dave,

WHITEWATER - LOCATION & FACILITIES FOR SERVICE CREW

I believe that now is the time to set the various elements in place for your 
department to meet our obligations with regard to service and warranty 
support on the project.

The project - located in Palm Springs - will comprise of 41 EWC 1.5 WTGs. The 
project site will not have any permanent facilities for operations and 
service personnel. The area is not secured and burglary is a major problem.

The EWC SCADA computer will be located within the substation building. The 
BOP contractor has requested a total of seven (7) T1 lines at the substation 
building for communications. He will make available one of these lines for 
use by EWC.

Our service crew trailer and tools container will have to be located off site 
in a secure location. We should start looking to rent secure space now. You 
will have to notify Robert Grant about the phone line requirements at the 
location where your service crew will based.

There will be a project site walk through on May 27. The BOP contractor 
expects to have the roads rough graded and the WTG pad locations staked at 
this time. You should arrange for someone from your group to be present on 
this day to develop familiarity with site and bring up any issues that may 
arise.

Best regards,

Mayura Botejue

Hi Keith,
Please review the following request from Mr. Verkleeren.

Inconsistencies with the grid downtime numbers at Mill Run.
Frequent PMT circuit breakers trip events.
 The Mill Run site had an event on 03/17, prior to the inclement weather, 
where pad's 1,3,5,6,7&8 had the PMT circuit breakers open @ approximately 
0900  but did not have any component failures and did not trip the SEL.

Per our conversation and the follow-up E'mail on 3/18, Zilkha is looking for 
a report on the steps taken to minimize the low gearbox oil pressure faults.

Best regards,

Philo

Subject: SCADA Inconsistencies @ Mill Run


Philo,

After exporting and reviewing Mill Run SCADA data (Monthly Production file) 
for the running month, I observed several inconsistencies between turbines 
that do not make sense.  Specifically, for the grid downtime realized over 
the weekend (a result of the ice storm) which you had the pleasure of sharing 
with me, there was a total of approximately 14 hours of grid downtime.  The 
downtime began at 1930 on 3-17-02 and essentially ran until 0930 on 3-18-02.  
During this time I closed the breaker restoring grid power to the site at 
2345 only to have the site trip again within the next 15 minutes. (This can 
clearly be seen by viewing the attached text file and looking at the line 
voltages, VA, VB, VC).

The grid downtime calculated and reported on the Monthly file for turbines # 
2, # 4 and # 7 is not even close to being correct.  Please review the 
attached excel spreadsheet generated from exported SCADA data as 
verification.  All of the other turbines are somewhat close to calculating 
the downtime correctly but there are still certain mysteries with those as 
well.  As you are aware, nearly all of the main circuit breakers tripped at 
Mill Run at approximately 0930 on 3-17-02, this likely partially explains why 
there is some variability between grid downtimes being recorded.  I say this 
because a total loss in power to the turbine is realized in this event and 
SCADA probably cannot differentiate between a main circuit breaker trip and a 
grid loss.

I am requesting an explanation for the inconsistencies noted between grid 
downtime allocations per turbine as calculated by Visupro/SCADA.  As a 
reminder, I am also looking for a report summarizing the measures taken to 
correct the low gearbox oil pressure faults, and feedback on why main circuit 
breakers are operating at both Mill Run and Somerset.  The main circuit 
breakers were intended to be an added safety/protection feature and I was 
lead to believe that they would not operate on a regular basis.  The main 
circuit breakers are tripping frequently, this suggests a possible safety 
concern and warrants immediate attention.

I look forward to your response

Best Regards,

Gary

Mark,

The following list is to be used when compiling the windsystem full power 
test.  We will use the SCADA 10-average data.  Turbines need to be grouped 
into bus-groups.  So, we will need to aggregate all turbines on the bus and 
run the test.

On a separate topic,

We need to apply a similar logic to the existing curtailment program.  Thus, 
there would be two numbers (Bus-1, and Bus-2).  Can you verify if the 
existing spread sheets using the 10% correction were outputted.  I can use 
those to query this list for the historical.  If not, we can run the routine 
after we make the change for the June report.  

Recall, this is the month we need to verify the prorating method by R.S. and 
our method.  When we run the analysis, we need to compile the curtailment 
file into the Feb. format and send to Dave Matson.

Of course, we can talk about running all these.  If need be, I or Mark could 
run this analysis.

On a per turbine basis he would be expecting some to have big drops. However 
for the entire site, the amount we were talking about would be about .5% (for 
1 month). Though I don't know if he expected individual turbines to have more 
impact on the site average than they do . For 10 turbines having one drop 5% 
only lowers the site by .5%.

If we are only talking about a .6% drop in avg. availability, we had better 
be ready to defend our numbers. Not just defend but convince Zilkha why we 
are right with our calcs. Mark F. unless I am mistaken, Gary V. is expecting 
a bigger drop??

Subject: Mill Run report through May with Virtual Mode corrections.

Summary:
The Jan - May 2002 availabilities are revised to exclude virtual mode / pause 
events.   The results showed that every turbine had between one and two hours 
each month where the WTG was transitioning between states as per design.   
Therefore, the resulting total hours of pausing and virtual mode for each 
turbine was decreased by one and a half hours.   In addition the pausing due 
to noise curtailment at turbine 7 between the hours of 7 PM and 5 AM local 
time was excluded.   No other changes were made to the SCADA data.  The net 
result is that the Jan availability dropped by 1.5%, Feb dropped by 0.4%,  
Mar dropped by 0.3%,  Apr dropped by 0.1%.   Dec 2001 data was not corrected 
due becasue the data recovery of the minana files in that month was very 
poor.  The Somerset report  is  well underway and will be in a similar form.

Hollis - 

What is the process for us to go through and calculate the "Vestas" 
availability as we previously defined, similar to Ben's description below?  
AWEA is the goal.  This would be a high priority.  Lets discuss.

Be well,
Ilan

Thanks Ilan, excellent; please copy me on future numbers.  Have you been able 
to determine what these numbers would look like using Vestas' definition of 
availability:  Hours of Wind Turbine in Operation mode X 100 / Hours of Grid 
in Operation Mode.  I sure would like to be able to present an 
apples-to-apples comparison at AWEA 2002.  Ben

Have accessed the .db files with Mark Fisher and they appear to look good. I 
will get with Rabi in the morning and test load the files to the development
side of the Oracle database (STAR).

John,

If you haven't already taken charge of this, could you work with Patricia to 
test the data that Kim Nguyen sent.  Be sure to pass on the results of this 
test to Kim and Ron Brzeniski.  

Mark,  thanks for jumping in.  There are some features of the tool sent from 
Clemens which may be useful, but I do not think it is ready.
