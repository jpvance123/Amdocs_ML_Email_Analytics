Office of the Chairman, in conjunction with the heads of each Operating=20
Company, has established a PRC Committee for the Associates and one for the=
=20
Analysts.  Each Committee will oversee the respective PRC meetings.   Detai=

II. Meeting Logistics

Enron will hold Eastern Hemisphere Associate and Analyst PRC meetings on Ju=
ly=20
17th in London. The PRC for the Eastern Hemisphere will include Europe, Ind=
ia=20
and Asia and will be chaired by John Sherriff.=20

The Western Hemisphere Associate and Analyst PRC meetings will be held on=
=20
July 19th in Houston.  The PRC for the Western Hemisphere will include Sout=
h=20
America, Calgary, Portland, Houston and Australia (Houston administers it)=
=20
and will be chaired by Joe Sutton.  The Analyst PRC will be conducted from=
=20
8:00 a.m. to 12:30 p.m., and the Associate PRC will be conducted from 1:30=
=20
p.m. to 6:30 p.m. =20

III. Process

Each PRC representative has been randomly assigned 15 to 17 Associates or=
=20
Analysts that they will represent in the PRC meeting.  Please note the PRC=
=20
rep is not representing only those individuals who may work in his or her=
=20
specific OpCo but individuals that work throughout the organization.  The P=
RC=20
rep will continue to represent the assigned Associates or Analysts during=
=20
their entire tenure with the Program.
The PRC reps are expected to contact the PRC supervisor and gather=20
performance information (including pre-ratings if available).
The Program will prepare a binder for each PRC rep that includes consolidat=
ed=20
feedback from the PEP system for their assigned Associates or Analysts and=
=20
will provide this to the PRC Representatives on July 7th.
Associates and Analysts will be pre-rated by their Business Unit supervisor=
=20
using the six performance ratings (Superior - Issues) and the Management=20
Professional feedback form as detailed in the PEP system.  The pre-ratings=
=20
must be loaded into PEP by July 6th. =20
The Associate and Analyst ratings will be cross-calibrated by tenure at the=
=20
meeting as follows:
Associates:
Level 1: 0 to 6 months
Level 2: 7 to 12 months
Levels 3 & 4 will be reviewed together: 13 months+.
Analysts:
Level 1: 0 to 6 months
Level 2: 7 to 12 months
Level 3: 13 to 24 months
Level 4 and 5 will be reviewed together: 25 months+
The rating determined in the global cross calibration meeting is final, and=
=20
cannot be changed once the meeting has ended.
Following the global Associate and Analyst PRC, the Associates=01, and the=
=20
Analysts=01, supervisors will obtain the final rating from the PRC=20
representative.  The supervisors must ensure that an evaluation session is=
=20
conducted and the final rating is communicated to each Associate and Analys=
t=20
by September 15th. The completed form must be signed by the Associate or=20
Analyst and returned to Terry Bosien in Human Resources by 9/18/00.

IV. Promotions
All promotions must be recommended in the PRC.
Associates are eligible for promotion to manager at their 18 and 24 month=
=20
anniversary.
Timing.  Anniversaries that occur from April 1st through September 30th=20
should be recommended in the July PRC and those that occur from October 1st=
=20
through March 31st should be recommended in the December PRC.   If the=20
promotion is granted it would become effective on the 1st of the month=20
following the PRC, or on the Associate=01,s anniversary date, whichever is =
later.
Associates promoted after March 31st for the July PRC and after September=
=20
30th for the December PRC will be evaluated as Associates for PRC purposes,=
=20
not as a Manager  (i.e. An Associate was promoted to Manager effective Apri=
l=20
1st.  In the July PRC the individual should be evaluated as an Associate no=

as a manager).
2nd year Analysts are to be recommended for promotion to 3rd year Analysts=

after completing the 2nd year, utilizing the same timing criteria outlined=

Dave,

You are representing Martin Lin, an associate currently in the research 
group, at the mid-year PRC.   We would like to promote Martin to a manager 
position in the research group, so you will need to nominate him for 
promotion at the PRC meeting for us.

Martin has spent the last four months supporting EBS.   His primary project 
has been development of a simulation model for analyzing the capability of 
the media-cast product running on the EBS network.   This type of analysis is 
critical to understanding what types of bottlenecks we might encounter in 
trying to service, for example, the Blockbuster deal.   Martin has already 
come  up to speed so that he is able to largely replace an expensive 
contractor from Lucent who is under contract to support this modelling 
effor.   Prior to supporting EBS, Martin used his engineering skills (B.S. 
Caltech, Ph.D. U.of Texas in EE) to create models of regional power 
transmission networks in order to better understand possible congestion 
constraints.  

In our internal pre-ranking meeting we felt that Martin was deserving of a 
rating of Superior due to his technical excellence, his excellent attitude 
and work ethic, and his ability to move projects forward with minimal 
supervision.

Regards,

Stinson

It's time once again to administer the Research Group's PRC!!

Attached you will find a list of your ee's.  Pls take a moment to pre-rank 
your employees using the consolidated feedback from their Mid-year 
performance reviews.  On the spreadsheet below, there is a category titled 
"ranking", please place your recommended ranking in this column and e-mail it 
back to me by noon this Friday.

Vince will be meeting with you all on Friday to discuss these pre-rankings.  

On Wednesday, 7/5 at 9A, pls join Vince and I in room EB1938 to formalize 
your employee rankings.

The ranking categories are as follows:

Superior
Excellent
Strong
Satisfactory
Needs Improvement
Issues

Additionally, I know that there have been many changes in staff and 
reportships over the last 6 months.  If you see that you are missing someone 
or someone is reporting to the wrong person, just let me know and I'll get it 
corrected asap.  

Call me with any questions or concerns!

Hi Vince

Following our PRC meeting yesterday, here are the high-level facts as I 
presented them:
Ben Parsons, overall: satisfactory.  Good interpersonal skills, we have 
questions on his quant abilities.  Reluctant to discuss/share his modelling 
work, and that which I have seen has too many hand fixes to give me 
confidence in his rigour.  Other EnronCredit.com feedback indicates that he 
is sometimes prepared to compromise quant analysis to keep the traders happy.
Matthew Williams, overall: excellent.  Superior quant skills, excellent 
everywhere else.  Recommended for promotion to Senior Specialist.
Kirstee Hewitt, overall: excellent.  A solid all-round performance, and a 
huge workload.  In recognition of the level of responsibility Kirstee is 
bearing I'm recommending her for promotion to Senior Specialist.
Sharad Agnihotri, overall: excellent.  Superior quant skills, excellent 
everywhere else.  Very self-directed and commercial-minded.  Already 
operating at manager level in my opinion.  Flagged for promotion next 
mid-year if performance continues at this level.
Slava Danilov, overall: excellent.  Superior quant skills, excellent 
everywhere else.  As a non-commercial-type quant he is hard to fault, but 
will probably never work on a trading desk.  Already operating at manager 
level in terms of his depth and rigour of analysis, and the extent to which 
he is contributing to the team.  Flagged for promotion next mid-year if 
performance continues at this level.

Steve

I made a mistake and put comments for another person into Krishnar's PRC.  
Please make sure that you ignore it if I can't get it fixed.  Below is what I 
intended to put in.  My apologies.  

I will get my assistant to get it deleted and put this information in on 
monday.  It won't let me do it now.  I guess it does not pay to leave 30 or 
40 reviews to the last day.  Paula: Please fix this for me and let Vince know 
either that it is fixed or cannot be fixed.

Innovation/Entrapraneurship
No Basis

Communicating Goal Setting
No Basis

Team Work / Communication
Excellent.  Very easy to work with and get along with.

Business Instincts
Excellent.  Krishnar is consistent in asking to help out and asking what more 
he could do to help us out.

Analystical Technical
Excellent.  Krishnar has a very strong grasp of what we are doing and how it 
should be done.

Overall
Excellent.  My interactions with Krishnar have been limited but positive.  
Krishnar is always positive with a positive attitude to get the job done.

Strengths:
Very strong analytical skills with a desire to add value.

Areas for Improvements
I don't understand Krisnar's role (is leading all research people on our 
floor or just some) well and have had limited interaction with him.  {all has 
been positive when it has ocurred} This suggests that Krishnar might spend 
more time define what his people are doing and getting feedback about their 
performance, and developing the project scope better.
