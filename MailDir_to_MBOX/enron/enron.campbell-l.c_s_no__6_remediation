George/Norm because there is no immediate concern or liability with the 
partially filled excavation, I want us wait for the official letter from the 
tribe before taking it upon ourselves to fill the excavation.  I dont want to 
send  a message to the Lagunas about us taking environmental matters into our 
own hands without involvement from the tribe.  If there is a reason to 
expidite the covering of this open area, then lets  send another  letter 
requesting to do so.  Given the other issues yet to be resolved at the 
station, lets keep the tribe involved and a part of our environmental 
activities.  I want to maintain a good working relationship with these 
people.  

As you may remember, they were a little irritated by Transwestern's neglect 
of not keeping them in the loop previously.  Lets not open that type of issue 
again......

Norm:
Per our telephone discussion this afternoon, I suggest you go ahead and 
backfill what remains of the open excavation that was created when the diesel 
UST was removed. A closure report was submitted to Ms. Bernacik of the Laguna 
Pueblo Environmental Department in January. We have not received a formal 
response from the Pueblo yet, but in a phone conversation, Ms. Bernacik 
indicated that they would have to take a closer look at the report before 
making a decision. Regardless, I don't think we need to wait on an approval 
of the closure report before backfilling the excavation. 
Thanks, George

John, Lou, Cutty, Bill, I want to bring this issue back up for your 
attention, as I know that everyone is very busy.  During the EPA Title V 
inspection at the Laguna C/S this past week, Barbara Bernacek, the Laguna 
environmental person was present.  She had been asked to be there by the 
EPA.  During our tour of the facility, she casually asked if any progress or 
decision had been made by Enron management towards remediation assistance in 
the groundwater issue at the Laguna C/S.  I had informed her that we were 
still actively discussing this issue and would contact her in the near future 
concerning management's decision.  I would appreciate it very much if each of 
you would revisit my memo below and  then lets discuss what should be done 
and the approach we should take in addressing the Laguna's concern about a 
proactive approach to reaching cleanup and closure.

Subject: Meeting with the Laguna's over the PCB remediation at C/S 6

I wanted to present this summary of the meeting Transwestern had with 
representatives of the Laguna Pueblo concerning the status of the PCB 
remediation activities by TW.  On the Laguna side were members of the Laguna 
pueblo, the PEOP a  technical oversight group that provides expertise and 
assistance on technical issues for all of the 19 pueblos in New Mexico 
(ranging from UST to superfund), and members of ETS ( 5 members of the Laguna 
team, Butch Russell, Rick Smith  (advisor for the Laguna team), myself)  and 
George Robinson.   This is the third meeting we had in the last year and a 
half with this group since the Lagunas have started showing renewed interest 
in environmental activities on their pueblo.

The meeting centered around two issues at the site: the closure of the UST 
and the PCB remediation activity.  With respect to the first, concensus was 
reached that we would continue monitoring and collecting groundwater samples 
at the two downstream well locations from the UST site on a quarterly basis, 
and send the results to POEP for review. 

With repsect to the PCB remediation issue, things were a little different.  
The POEP representatives expressed concern on behalf of the Laguna tribal 
Coucil that the progress of the remediation activities Transwestern is 
presently using to bring closure to the site is not showing positive goals 
toward  achieving cleanup at the site and that the data submittals to the 
Lagunas have verified this.  They indicated that that have been patient with 
Transwstern's attempts to allow natural attenuation to reduce the PCB 
contamination, but based upon the historic sampling results, that this 
technology is not proving to be very successful, in fact the results have 
shown stagnant results  (Im using their words).  They would like to see 
Transwestern implement other more proactive technologies to arrive at cleanup 
and closure of this site.   Members of the Laguna pueblo, who work for the 
POEP,  expressed concern that the PCB contamination could negatively impact 
future generations of Lagunas members and that it was the responsibility of 
Transwestern to clean up the contamination which they brought onto their 
lands.   One member of the Laguna pueblo called the contamination a "cancer"  
with potential to spread.   A comment was made by the POEP that there was a 
major potential of increasing the magnitude and spread of the contamination 
if we continue to just maintain  our present approach of just monitoring the 
site and installing additional wells..

A member of the POEP has been in contact with a consortum of individuals from 
North Dakota State University, (Energy and Environmental Research Center) who 
claim to be experts in reclamation of contaminated sites which are considered 
difficult to remediate (this site would certainly fall into this category due 
to the presence of the sandstone bedrock which has numerous cracks and 
channels present which direct  the PCB containing liquids present at the 
site).  Although the POEP was not recommending Transwestern utilize their 
service, they did strongly suggest that we should at least discuss this site 
with them.

It shold also be mentioned that Syed Risvi, the POEP Superfund representative 
was at this meeting.  He had mentioned that the  POEP has been in discussions 
with EPA Region VI concerning potential classification of the site on the 
CERCLIS list of sites for inclusion on the NPL..  He had indicated that he 
did not want to see this site included on the list, but stated that 
Transwetern needed to update and show postive results in our remediation 
efforts and that it was the tribal councils opinion that this was not being 
done.

At the conclusion of the meeting, I informed the POEP that Transwestern's 
internal remediation group  would contact the NDSU group and discuss the site 
characteristics with them and we would reprot back to them the results of our 
discussions.  This seemed to satisify the  POEP and they were content with 
this. 

John, I would like to schedule a conference call with the above list of 
people and discuss this issue.  A couple of things I want to bring out.  
First, we will be undergoing ROW and Compressor Station renewals with the 
Lagunas in the near future.  Second, on the Laguna tribal lands, they have 
experienced other releases of contimation and are currently very sensitive to 
this whole  contamination problem.  Although we are considered by the POEP as 
proactive up to this point  and very easy to work with (direct quote from the 
POEP)   they are wanting a more proactive and measurable effort from 
Transwestern to clean up the PCBs. 
Please get back with me on this.

On Wednesday, October 20th, I contacted Ms. Barbara Bernacik at the Office of 
the Pueblo of Laguna, Division of Environment. I contacted Ms. Bernacik at 
the suggestion of Norm Gonzales (TW Laguna Team) to discuss outstanding 
environmental issues at the Station. 

In a conversation with Norm the previous week, Norm indicated to me that he 
had met with Ms. Bernacik and Ray Lucero (Engineer, Pueblo of Laguna) 
recently in regards to backfilling an open excavation which had been 
excavated in 1993 when a diesel UST was removed from the site. The excavation 
had not been backfilled pending authorization from the Pueblo of Laguna. This 
and other outstanding issues were discussed in a meeting with Ray Lucero, the 
Governor of the Pueblo of Laguna, Ted Ryther, Larry Campbell, Butch Russell, 
and myself back in 1995 but there was no resolution of the issues, primarily 
because at the time the Laguna's did not have an environmental staff person 
to address such issues. Subsequently, Ms. Bernacik was hired as the Laguna's 
environmental staff person about two years ago. 

In the course of Norm's conversation with Ms. Bernacik and Mr. Lucero, Mr. 
Lucero indicated some concern that the Pueblo of Laguna had not been kept 
apprised of environmental issues at the Station. In light of this, I have 
prepared a "Report of Groundwater Monitoring Activities". This report covers 
monitoring activities between June 1994 and June 1999. As previously 
mentioned, I also contacted Ms. Bernacik for the purpose of introducing 
myself and to inform her that a report has been prepared and will be 
delivered to her office. I also suggested that we meet at the site to discuss 
outstanding environmental issues. The response from Ms. Bernacik was very 
favorable and we agreed to meet at the site at 10:00 am November 16th. Ms. 
Bernacik also indicated that someone from the BIA will be with her.

Ester Antonio at the Laguna Tribal Office had contacted Norm Gonzales (Laguna 
Team) last week with some questions regarding a permit the Tribe was going to 
issue to TW for drilling the six additional off-site monitor wells. The 
questions were in regard to: 1) project start and complete date; and 2) who 
to issue the permit to. I contacted Ester this afternoon to discuss these 
items. Ester will issue the permit to Norm Gonzales with a start date of 
1/17/00 and a complete date of 2/17/00. Ester indicated that the permit can 
be reissued with different dates if necessary. Ester also indicated that I 
should contact Thurman "TJ" Robinson with the BIA Laguna Office regarding 
NEPA documentation. I contacted TJ and he said that he has submitted the 
paperwork for a "categorical exclusion" for the additional wells. TJ said 
that this was submitted to the BIA office in Albuquerque and that we could 
still shoot for January 17th as a start date. He said he would fax a copy of 
the document to me once he receives it. He also indicated that he still 
needed to check into whether there is a fee associated with the submittal and 
he would get back to me on this issue.

A meeting was held at C/S 6, Laguna on Tuesday November 16th, to reintroduce 
the pueblo of Laguna to Transwestern's environmental activities at the 
facility.  The Laguna's have hired an environmental person to oversee 
environmental issues on pueblo lands.  The meeting centered around three 
issues:  a UST site which had been removed, but not formally closed, a 
historic removal of asbestos which had been buried at the facility in the 
late 1980's, and the ongoing groundwater remediation at  the site.  

Transwestern provided a history of the above mentioned activiites and why 
these issues were unresolved in the "eyes" of the Laguna.  Transwestern 
committed to submitting closure requests for the UST and asbestos issues.  
With repsect to the groundwater issue, a presentation was given enlighting 
the Laguna representative of the difficult nature of the subsurface geology 
and groundwater characteristics to rapidly clean the contaminants 
(chlorinated solvents and PCB's) and Transwestern's intent to continue its 
remediation efforts. Transwestern assured the Laguna environmental 
representative that all correspondance and data pertaining to environmental 
issues would be submitted to the pueblo agency.   At the conclusion of the 
meeting, the Laguna's understood Transwestern's commitment to maintaining the 
policies and practices consistent with the pueblo of Laguna.

The meeting provided Transwestern and the Laguna's with the opportunity to 
meet and share ideas and opinions and initiate working relationships.  The 
Laguna's now have an understanding of the environmental activities at the 
site and what Transwestern's approach is to removing the contaminants.   The 
Laguna's appreciated Transwestern's efforts and commitment to environmental 
compliance on the Laguna pueblo.

I called Ms. Bernacik this afternoon regarding several issues. 
1.)  Ms. Bernacik indicated that the POEP has formed a Superfund division 
which is lead by a fellow named Mr. Rizvi. Mr. Rizvi had contacted Ms. 
Bernacik and requested the opportunity to be present at the site during the 
next semiannual sampling event. This event is tentatively scheduled for the 
week of June 19th. I am to notify Ms. Bernacik when we have set a firm date 
for sampling. 
2.)  Ms. Bernacik asked if we had received an extension to the off-site 
access permit from the Pueblo so that we could install the three additional 
wells. I indicated that I believe the extension was issued and Norm had 
picked it up but I wasn't certain. I followed-up with Norm and he has picked 
up the permit. Drilling activities are scheduled for the week of June 5th.
3.)  I asked Ms. Bernacik about our request for no further action on the UST 
removal. Ms. Bernacik indicated that Norm Moreno at the POEP had responded to 
her with comments on the request and recommended against closing the issue. 
Ms. Bernacik said that she would send us a copy of Mr. Moreno's letter. At a 
minimum, the Pueblo will require continued monitoring. This does not change 
our monitoring plan since we had already proposed continued monitoring of the 
UST area wells as part of our facility wide groundwater monitoring program. 
However, Ms. Bernacik also indicated that the Pueblo may require one or two 
additional monitor wells in the former UST area.
4.)  I asked Ms. Bernacik about backfilling the former UST excavation area. 
Ms. Bernacik indicated that her office had already issued an approval of TW's 
request to close the landfarm. I asked again about backfilling the excavation 
but was having difficulty communicating my interest was backfilling the 
excavation rather than closure of the landfarm. I reviewed the letter from 
Ms. Bernacik regarding closure of the landfarm and it does not specifically 
address backfilling the excavation. I believe that Ms. Bernacik is under the 
impression that her office has already approved backfilling the excavation, 
if we still want to get this in writing, it may be best for Norm to visit 
with Ms. Bernacik at her office in order to better explain what we need.

The POEP representatives expressed concern on behalf of the Laguna tribal 
Coucil that the progress of the remediation activities Transwestern is 
presently using to bring closure to the site is not showing positive goals 
toward  achieving cleanup at the site and that the data submittals to the 
Lagunas have verified this.  They indicated that that have been patient with 
Transwstern's attempts to allow natural attenuation to reduce the PCB 
contamination, but based upon the historic sampling results, that this 
technology is not proving to be very successful, in fact the results have 
shown stagnant results  (Im using their words).  They would like to see 
Transwestern implement other more proactive technologies to arrive at cleanup 
and closure of this site.   Members of the Laguna pueblo, who work for the 
POEP,  expressed concern that the PCB contamination could negatively impact 
future generations of Lagunas members and that it was the responsibility of 
Transwestern to clean up the contamination which they brought onto their 
lands.   One member of the Laguna pueblo called the contamination a "cancer"  
with potential to spread.   A comment was made by the POEP that there was a 
major potential of increasing the magnitude and spread of the contamination 
if we continue to just maintain  our present approach of just monitoring the 
site and installing additional wells..

A member of the POEP has been in contact with a consortum of individuals from 
North Dakota State University, (Energy and Environmental Research Center) who 
claim to be experts in reclamation of contaminated sites which are considered 
difficult to remediate (this site would certainly fall into this category due 
to the presence of the sandstone bedrock which has numerous cracks and 
channels present which direct  the PCB containing liquids present at the 
site).  Although the POEP was not recommending Transwestern utilize their 
service, they did strongly suggest that we should at least discuss this site 
with them.

It shold also be mentioned that Syed Risvi, the POEP Superfund representative 
was at this meeting.  He had mentioned that the  POEP has been in discussions 
with EPA Region VI concerning potential classification of the site on the 
CERCLIS list of sites for inclusion on the NPL..  He had indicated that he 
did not want to see this site included on the list, but stated that 
Transwetern needed to update and show postive results in our remediation 
efforts and that it was the tribal councils opinion that this was not being 
done.

At the conclusion of the meeting, I informed the POEP that Transwestern's 
internal remediation group  would contact the NDSU group and discuss the site 
characteristics with them and we would reprot back to them the results of our 
discussions.  This seemed to satisify the  POEP and they were content with 
this. 

John, I would like to schedule a conference call with the above list of 
people and discuss this issue.  A couple of things I want to bring out.  
First, we will be undergoing ROW and Compressor Station renewals with the 
Lagunas in the near future.  Second, on the Laguna tribal lands, they have 
experienced other releases of contimation and are currently very sensitive to 
this whole  contamination problem.  Although we are considered by the POEP as 
proactive up to this point  and very easy to work with (direct quote from the 
POEP)   they are wanting a more proactive and measurable effort from 
Transwestern to clean up the PCBs. 
Please get back with me on this.

Thanx, George.  Please let us know what their initial reaction and evaluation 
is of the conditions at Sta. 6.  Im interested in what their thoughts are 
with respect to the remediation of  the sandstone fractures and movement of 
condensate with PCB's..

Larry,
I contacted Norm Moreno at the POEP this afternoon. He said that he would 
contact Ed Steadman, Associate Director at the EERC, and pass along my name 
and number so that Ed could contact me. Norm said that he would prefer to do 
it this way rather than to have us initiate the first contact. The other day 
I found the web site for the research center (www.eerc.und.nodak.edu).

I received a call this morning from Jaroslav "Jarda" Solc (701-777-5217). 
Jarda is a Senior Research Manager for the Groundwater Resource & Remediation 
Group at the Energy & Environmental Research Center (EERC). Jarda reports to 
Edward "Ed" Steadman, Associate Director for Research at the EERC. Norm 
Moreno with the POEP had contacted Ed, provided him with my name and number, 
and asked if Ed's organization would contact us in regard to the EERC 
providing some assistance to TW with remediation of PCB contamination at the 
Laguna site. 

I provided a brief description of site conditions and we then discussed 
alternative remediation methods. Based on the information I provided, Jarda 
agreed that continued monitoring seemed to be appropriate. Jarda also 
indicated that his group did not have any off-the-shelf type remediation 
technologies that would be applicable. I suggested to Jarda that his 
organization might still be of service to TW in our discussions with the 
Pueblo and the POEP as a third party opinion. Jarda said that he would 
discuss this with Ed and get back to me.

I wanted to present this summary of the meeting Transwestern had with 
representatives of the Laguna Pueblo concerning the status of the PCB 
remediation activities by TW.  On the Laguna side were members of the Laguna 
pueblo, the PEOP a  technical oversight group that provides expertise and 
assistance on technical issues for all of the 19 pueblos in New Mexico 
(ranging from UST to superfund), and members of ETS ( 5 members of the Laguna 
team, Butch Russell, Rick Smith  (advisor for the Laguna team), myself)  and 
George Robinson.   This is the third meeting we had in the last year and a 
half with this group since the Lagunas have started showing renewed interest 
in environmental activities on their pueblo.

The meeting centered around two issues at the site: the closure of the UST 
and the PCB remediation activity.  With respect to the first, concensus was 
reached that we would continue monitoring and collecting groundwater samples 
at the two downstream well locations from the UST site on a quarterly basis, 
and send the results to POEP for review. 

With repsect to the PCB remediation issue, things were a little different.  
The POEP representatives expressed concern on behalf of the Laguna tribal 
Coucil that the progress of the remediation activities Transwestern is 
presently using to bring closure to the site is not showing positive goals

Guys, look at the attached draft of a letter I plan on sending to the Laguna 
pueblo regarding Transwestern efforts to date of finding new technologies to 
address and remove PCB contamination from the groundwater at the facility.

You may remember, we had a meeting in January to hear the Laguna's concerns 
that Transwestern was not moving fast enough to clean up the site.  This 
letter addresses our attempts to find a solution to the PCB problem, and that 
remediation technologies are not presently available to operate effectively 
at the site given the sites unique characterisstics.  Id like to send this 
out on Friday or Monday.
