IntercontinentalExchange is pleased to announce  that weather swaps trading will be included in its new version 8 release. These  fixed-for-floating financial products will be cash settled on a five-day average  temperature, Monday - Friday, for the current week and for the forward week.  Temperatures used for the settlement of these products will be those reported  by EarthSat, a widely recognized and independent source of weather data. Settlement  temperatures provided by EarthSat will be available via the IntercontinentalExchange  website. The hub locations for weather trades will be the primary airport weather  stations at Chicago-O'Hare, Dallas-Fort Worth, New York-La Guardia, Philadelphia-International  and Sacramento-Executive. The standard contract size for all locations will  be $10,000 per degree Fahrenheit, with a tic increment of 0.1 degree Fahrenheit  or $1,000. There are no payout limits on the contracts. 
The design and development of these new weather  products was done under the guidance of Aquila Energy Marketing Corp., a recognized  leader in weather product concepts. In addition, IntercontinentalExchange has  worked with Aquila and other major weather market participants, including Reliant  Energy, Mirant Americas, and El Paso Merchant Energy, to build consensus and  support for these new products.
To trade weather swaps you must have our new version 8 release installed on your system. An advisory  with details about this new release is being sent to you by separate email.

Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.
 
Enron Global Technology

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

\---------------------------------------------/


1. Main Course: In Cookbooks, a Passport Home, Wherever
That May Be
===================================================

A number of new cookbooks, filled with recipes that seem
at once familiar and new, give you all you need to satisfy
a yearning to feed others. Amanda Hesser discusses some of
the best, and includes selected recipes.
http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/24/dining/24BOOK.html?rd=hcmcp?p=041IN8041IMH44iiz012000mN97rN9Rx

On Menus Everywhere, a Big Slice of Patriotism

The entire city has been swept away by a tide of patriotic
sentiment, writes William Grimes, and those engaged with
food are no exception.
http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/24/dining/24NOTE.html?rd=hcmcp?p=041IN0041IMH44iiz012000mN97rN9Rx


2. Recipe of the Week: Combining Fire and Rice, and a Few
Choice Flavors
===================================================

Pilaf is far easier to make than risotto, it is equally
delicious, and it is capable of producing scores of spin-
offs. Mark Bittman provides recipes for basic pilaf, plus
a set of wonderful variations.

Gelee: So Chic, So French, So Slippery

This recipe for crab salad with Apple gelee mixes Jell-O's
very sophisticated Gallic sister with the tanginess of
apples and the softness of crab.

3. Wine List: Trivial Pursuit That Goes to Your Head
===================================================

The Shafer Line on Wine newsletter, from Shafer Vineyards
in the Napa Valley, offers no harvest reports, no tales of
the winery cat, not even a single obvious plug for Shafer
wines. And that, says Frank J. Prial, is a good thing.

Wine picks: Leslie Sbrocco's Cellar Suggestions

The adage "what's old is new again" certainly holds true
for wine as grape varieties synonymous with Old World
wines are thriving in the New World. Pinot noir, the grape
responsible for red Burgundy, is causing a buzz in New
Zealand; syrah, a star in France's Northern Rhone region,
is rising to new heights in Chile; and barbera, a staple
of Italy's Piedmont region, has found a home in
California's Gold Country.

1999 Lynskeys Wairau Peaks, Pinot Noir
Marlborough, New Zealand
$33 -- Can the promise of pinot noir be realized in New
Zealand? The quality has been unpredictable over the past
few years, but this bottling shows the potential of the
grape in cool-climate Marlborough. The ripe, black cherry
fruit is reminiscent of an Oregon pinot, the velvety
texture is almost Californian in nature, and it sports
just enough earthiness to think of Burgundy. All these
elements, however, blend seamlessly in this unique wine.

1999 Caliterra, "Arboleda" Syrah
Colchagua Valley, Chile
$20 -- Syrah from the Northern Rhone region of France is
known for its rustic, intense nature while syrah from
Chile is just beginning to develop its own personality. If
you like Rhone wines, Caliterra's new label, Arboleda, is
one to seek out. It's powerful and rather opulent with a
telltale smoky, blackberry character, but also has zesty
acidity, which wakes up the palate.

1999 Boeger Winery, Barbera
El Dorado, California
$15-- Barbera from Italy's Piedmont region is juicy, fresh
and rather tart. In this version Boeger has managed to
capture the quality of the grape variety while injecting a
little California sunshine. Think plump raspberries and
bing cherries with a dash of licorice.


4. NYC Restaurants: A Supercool Setting, but a Warm
Welcome
===================================================

Somewhere along the line, Man Ray decided that a
restaurant does not have to sneer to be stylish. William
Grimes reviews the restaurant, which he says takes its
food seriously -- perhaps even too seriously.
http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/24/dining/24REST.html?rd=hcmcp?p=041IMv041IMH44iiz012000mN97rN9Rx

$25 and Under: A Traditional Cook-It-Yourself Korean Feast

The New York Kom Tang Kalbi House recalls a time not long
ago when Korean restaurants were cloistered in several
blocks of Midtown. Eric Asimov prefers the way Kom Tang
serves their tabletop grill, with braziers filled with
natural wood charcoal.

I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

Accelerating growth

Share prices suggest a 2002 rebound; PerkinElmer's growth poised to pick up.

By Michael Sivy

NEW YORK (CNN/Money) - Investors know that earnings for the current quarter
will be lousy. And they've written off results for the first quarter of
next year as well. At this point, share prices reflect hopes for the second
quarter of 2002.

Nonetheless, the Dow has moved up almost 20 percent since its low of 8,236
on Sept. 21, fueled largely by falling interest rates and investors'
expectations of those eventual earnings rebounds.

After declining steadily since June, 10-year bond yields have turned up in
the past three weeks. This reversal reflects improving consumer confidence,
a drop-off in new unemployment claims and other data suggesting that an
economic upturn may finally be under way.

At the same time, however, those higher interest rates temporarily undercut
stock prices. In addition, stocks could be knocked back by any unusually
bad earnings surprises, by negative guidance for next year's results, or by
another unexpected terrorist attack.

Those possibilities have some market strategists worrying that stocks have
run too far too fast. As a result, the most timely shares in this
environment are those whose prices have not made a big move since
mid-September, but which still enjoy strong growth prospects.

PerkinElmer (PKI: down $0.33 to $28.55, Research, Estimates) is a mid-sized
diversified technology company with annual revenue of just under $2
billion. Since 1998, profit growth has been accelerating. After
single-digit annual earnings gains in the early 1990s, growth picked up to
a compound 13 percent in the past five years. And it's projected to top 17
percent annually during the next five years, supported by a return on
equity of close to 20 percent a year.

One of the most important factors sustaining PerkinElmer's accelerating
profit growth is the company's emphasis on its most promising businesses -
and its efforts to build those franchises. Two weeks ago, PerkinElmer
completed the acquisition of Packard BioScience, a leader in drug-discovery
systems. The acquisition strengthens PerkinElmer's life-sciences division,
which accounted for 16 percent of last year's operating income.

The company's two other fast-growing divisions are optoelectronics (33
percent of income) and instruments (32 percent). PerkinElmer has announced
plans to shed slower growing operations, most notably its fluid sciences
division, as well as some other minor lines. Third-quarter results show how
those moves will boost the company's growth: While net income was up 16
percent, earnings from the operations PerkinElmer's plans to retain rose 27
percent.

Economic weakness may limit earnings growth this quarter and next. And
dilution from the acquisition from the Packard acquisition will erode
full-year results a bit. But analysts still expect profit growth of around
13 percent for 2002, accelerating to the high teens from 2003 onward. At a
current share price of $28.50, PerkinElmer trades at less than 23 times
projected 2002 earnings. That's quite reasonable for a stock with such
attractive niche businesses.

                      COLUMBIA GAS TRANSMISSION CORPORATION                                 
                        NOTICE TO ALL INTERESTED PARTIES
                                OCTOBER 18, 2001

Notice ID: 3193
5 - NO RESPONSE REQUIRED                          


NOTE:  The following is being provided by Columbia as notice to all of its 
shippers of potential outages or reductions in available capacity in the 
identified portions of the system due to construction activities, routine 
maintenance, modifications, tests or repairs undertaken to protect the 
integrity and performance capability of its storage and transmission 
facilities.  The information provided below is subject to change for numerous 
reasons, including but not limited to, third-party controlled events and 
decisions, weather, work schedules, equipment availability, force majeure 
events, etc.  Thus, while Columbia is willing to provide this notice and update 
it periodically as necessary, Columbia is unable to represent and warrant that 
the specific activities will occur, or that they will occur on or near the 
specified dates. 

SUBJECT:   LINE SM-123

Columbia anticipates that between October 25th and October 27th, Line SM-123 
will be taken out of service due to long-wall mining activity.  Columbia 
estimates the line to be out of service for twenty-one (21) days.  The start 
date and duration of the outage is contingent upon the actual timing and 
progress of the long-wall mining activity.  Given the level of firm commitments 
in this area, Columbia believes that there will be no available capacity for 
interruptible transportation.

The following receipt points will be affected:

   Equitable Gas:    Beaver Creek      (H1)
                     Hi Hat            (F3)

   CNR Pipeline:     Boldman           (CNR02)
                     Conoway           (CNR03)
                     Johns Creek       (CNR08)
                     Canada            (CNR09)
                     Canada            (CNR10)
                     Stafford          (CNR11)
                     Thacker/Majestic  (CNR12)
                     Briar Mtn.        (CNR13)
                     Huff Creek        (CNR14)

   Conoco:           Grant             (P1)

The same is true with respect to any Appalachian production flowing directly 
into Columbia's Line KA between Columbia's Boldman Compressor Station and 
Columbia's Huff Creek Compressor Station as well as production flowing into 
Columbia's Lines SM-116, KA-15, PM-3 and PM-17.

Deep value


While you're waiting for the economy to rebound, take a look at some of the
incredibly cheap bargains that are still available.

By Michael Sivy

Investors are hoping the economic recovery will begin by the second quarter
of 2002. But signals are still mixed -- and economists are waiting to see
how strong retail sales are during the all-important holiday season. I
continue to be optimistic about next year's economy. And the overall market
is behaving as though the upturn isn't far off. But we had a false start in
May and June, and there's still no way of being sure that a sustainable
recovery is about to take hold.

The good news amid all this uncertainty is that many stocks have lagged the
recent market pickup -- and they're still selling at extraordinarily low
prices. Sanford C. Bernstein's Strategic Value fund includes a lot of these
bargain-priced issues, which Bernstein calls "deep-value stocks." Here's a
quick look at five stocks that Bernstein has favored this year.

American Electric Power
One of the nation's lowest-cost electricity producers, AEP [AEP] serves
nearly 5 million customers in the middle of the country, from Ohio to
Louisiana. The company is considering a plan to divide regulated and
non-regulated businesses, which could boost the total value of the stock.
Earnings growth is projected at 7 percent annually over the next five
years, and the shares yield 5.7 percent, high even for a utility. At
$42.40, the stock trades at just over 11 times next year's estimated earnings.

Dow Chemical
Now the largest chemical company by revenues (ahead of DuPont), Dow's [DOW]
basic chemical businesses are in the midst of a cyclical earnings decline,
compounded by dilution following February's acquisition of Union Carbide.
Profits should start rebounding in the second half of next year, helped by
an improving economy and post-merger cost cutting. Earnings could grow 9
percent annually over the next five years, and the yield is 3.5 percent. At
$38, the stock trades at 27 times next year's earnings.

Occidental Petroleum
One of the most profitable oil companies on a per-barrel basis, Oxy's [OXY]
earnings have been held back by its chemical operations. Results will be
depressed next year, but should rebound in 2003. The stock is a likely
takeover candidate if the industry consolidates. Earnings could grow 9
percent annually over the next five years, and the yield is 4 percent. At
$24.90, the stock trades at 12.5 times next year's earnings.

Sears
Still one of the largest U.S. retailers, Sears [S] is No.1 in appliances.
The company has emphasized energy-efficient models, which are popular
because of consumers' concerns about high oil and gas prices. Earnings
could grow 9 percent annually over the next five years, and the yield is 2
percent. At $45.10, the stock trades at less than 11 times next year's
earnings.

Washington Mutual
The nation's largest thrift with offices in 42 states, Washington Mutual
[WM] has traditionally been strong in adjustable-rate mortgages. Those ARMs
have recently lost share to fixed-rate loans because long-term interest
rates have been so low. As a result, the share price is now undervalued
relative to other financial companies. Earnings could grow percent 13
annually over the next five years, and the yield is 2.9 percent. At $33.10,
the stock trades at nine times next year's earnings.

Good Morning!

Bottom line: No Changes.

For the near term (1-5), we see some cool anomalies arriving into the Dakotas by Monday already, with highs in the Dakotas in the mid-30s and lows in the mid-teens.By Tuesday, Texas and the Midwest will be in the below normal category, with Dallas overnights in the mid-30s (normal low 43), Houston's low in the mid-40s (normal upper-40s) and Chicago will freeze, with a mid-20 overnight.  Progressing into the Northeast by wednesday, Philly and New York will get into the below normal category, but 5 or 6 degree anomalies are most likely.  Looks like a three day event as it moves easterly and then is followed by moderation into the...

6-10 Day time period, which will see a cool shot over the Midwest/East towards next weekend, moderating again by early the following week. Then, early in the...

11-15 Day time period, more cool air moves in, beginning with central cooling, then even into the Southeast.

So, with normals dropping across the nation, this first cool air anomaly event arriving in the Midwest by Tuesday will elevate the nation's gas demand requirements into the 60 Bcf/d plus regime from here on through the winter.  Here's the strip beginning with today:

Sat 	11/17	47 Bcfd
Sun	11/18	52 Bcfd 
Mon	11/19	55 Bcfd
Tue	11/20	67 Bcfd

Notice # 01-366
October 31, 2001

TO:
All NYMEX Division members
All NYMEX Division cleating members

FROM:
J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

RE:
Introduction of EFS Trading in Natural Gas



The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., will begin offering tomorrow
exchange of futures for swap (EFS) transactions in the first step of its
plans to offer over clearing services to the over-the-counter (OTC) natural
gas market.

This plan will also include the introduction of large order execution in
the
natural gas futures market and electronic trading of cleared natural gas
swaps and basis contracts.

We are delighted that we were able to expedite the introduction of this
instrument as the current climate in the natural gas market has served to
reinforce the necessity of credit intermediation.  The liquidity of our
market, combined with a clearinghouse that has half billion dollars
available to participants on each of the Exchange divisions through each
guarantee fund and the respective clearing members, put us in a unique
position to offer these services.

In addition, natural gas futures and options volume in 2000 reached the
equivalent of approximately 230 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and the
notional value of last year's transactions Exchange-wide totaled $3
trillion, or $14 billion per day.

EFS transactions will work similarly to exchange of futures for physical
(EFP) transactions.  Two parties will be allowed to privately negotiate the
execution of an integrated over-the-counter swaps and related futures
transaction on pricing terms agreed upon by the involved parties.  The
transaction must involve approximately equal but opposite side-of-market
quantities of futures and swap exposures in the same or related commodities
and will be permitted until two hours after trading terminates in the
underlying futures contract.  EFS transactions will be permitted to
liquidate, initiate, and transfer futures market positions between the two
parties involved in the transaction.  The Exchange will charge $10 per side
for each EFS transaction.  The clearing member representing each party will
be responsible to notify the Exchange of the amount and type of futures
contracts involved, the price at which the futures transaction should be
cleared, and the identity of the parties involved.

Forward Looking and Cautionary Statements
The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., has attempted, wherever possible,
to
make statements in good faith , as of the date of this release, by using
words such as anticipate, believes, expects, and words and terms of similar
substance in connection with any discussion of its present and future
operations within the industry. Any forward-looking statements made by, or
on behalf of the Exchange, involve a number of risks, trends,
uncertainties,
and other factors which may cause actual results to differ materially,
including; the Exchange=s receipt of the necessary Commodity Futures
Trading
Commission approval; timely performance and cooperative effort of exchange
partners; and changes in financial or business conditions at the Exchange.

Surprise me

The big surprise this week is that
earnings are coming in slightly better
than expected.

NEW YORK (CNNmoney) - The great
thing about unrelenting pessimism is that
any surprises are likely to be pleasant
ones. That's pretty much the point
investors reached after the Sept. 11
attacks. Expectations for third-quarter
profits are now so negative that even mediocre reports count
as good news. In fact, the results that have come out in the
past few days -- particularly for some of the financials and
drug companies -- are better than mediocre.

I continue to be somewhat more optimistic than many
economists. I believe that the Federal Reserve's enormous
interest-rate cuts will fuel an upturn in the economy -- and
that the rate cuts would already be taking effect were it not
for the economic damage stemming from Sept. 11. Fears of
further terrorism continue to undermine the market,
overshadowing faint signs of improving fundamentals. As a
result, the Dow was down 151 points on Wednesday, despite
several strong earnings reports.

Freddie Mac (FRE: down $0.44 to $66.65, Research,
Estimates)  reported a 26 percent earnings gain for the third
quarter. That follows Fannie Mae's (FNM: down $0.73 to
$80.85, Research, Estimates)  strong report, which I
discussed in Monday's column (see "A lender's market").
Citigroup (C: up $0.47 to $46.56, Research, Estimates)
announced a 9 percent decline in third-quarter earnings after
expenses related to last month's attacks. Without the
unexpected charges, Citigroup would have posted a
double-digit gain, and the company projects 15 percent
growth in the fourth quarter. J.P. Morgan Chase (JPM: up
$0.66 to $34.60, Research, Estimates) announced a 68
percent drop in earnings -- but the results were in line with
analysts' reduced forecasts.

The strongest sector this fall may well turn out to be
pharmaceuticals. Two leading companies reported strong
results on Wednesday. Pfizer, the world's leading drugmaker,
turned in a stunning 28 percent profit gain for the third
quarter, confirming the company's status as the must-own
choice in the industry. Blockbuster products such as
anti-cholesterol drug Lipitor helped fuel sales, while cost
cutting in the wake of last year's Warner-Lambert acquisition
bolstered profit margins. Solid but less flamboyant gains were
announced by Johnson & Johnson, where third-quarter
earnings gained nearly 16 percent.

A few bright spots don't add up to a fireworks display, but
there are two pieces of conventional wisdom worth keeping in
mind right now. The first is that the direction of the market
depends on how profit trends compare with expectations.
The bad news has already been factored into stock prices.
What matters from here on is not whether results are good,
but whether they're not as bad as feared.

The other fact to remember is the importance of
diversification. The greatest upside leverage when the
economy recovers will probably be among the big-cap tech
stocks. But drug stocks are equally important parts of a
well-balanced growth portfolio.

J&J's (JNJ: up $1.00 to $57.77, Research, Estimates)  13
percent long-term annual growth rate and broad
diversification within health-care makes it an appealing choice
for conservative investors. At $58 a share, the stock trades
at 26 times next year's projected results. But it may be
smarter to pay up a little more for Pfizer (PFE: up $0.55 to
$41.65, Research, Estimates). At $41.65, the shares are
trading at 28 times projected earnings for 2002. That's not a
cheap P/E, but it's a small premium to pay for the No. 1
company in the industry with a core growth rate of nearly 20
percent a year.

NGI's Daily Gas Price Index

FERC Approves Transco's Leidy Project, Petal Expansion, New ANR Lateral 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued draft orders Wednesday for Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line's Leidy East expansion in Pennsylvania, a pipeline and deliverability expansion at Petal Gas Storage in Mississippi and a new ANR lateral to serve to 1,050 MW Badger power plant in Kenosha, WI. 
Transco's $98 million Leidy East pipe expansion project would make up for the failed Phase III portion of its MarketLink expansion. The Leidy East project will provide up to 130,000 Dth/d of transportation from Leidy, PA, to northeastern markets in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. The expansion consists of six pipeline loop segments that amount to 26 miles of 42-inch diameter pipe, and about 5 miles of 30-inch diameter, mostly in Western PA. The project also would add 3,400 hp of compression in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. 
Williams said this summer that it expects the Leidy East facilities to be in service by November 2002 (see Daily GPI, June 20 <http://intelligencepress.com/subscribers/daily/news/d20010620e.html>). The Williams subsidiary said Aquila Energy Marketing, PECO Energy Co., Reliant Energy Services and Williams Energy Marketing are all customers. 
Petal Gas Storage LLC's new pipeline would extend 59 miles to a connection with Southern Natural at a compressor station near Enterprise, MS. The $94 million project also includes a new 9,000 horsepower compressor station. 
ANR Pipeline's lateral will carry about 210 MMcf/d of gas to Badger Generating Co's proposed power plant in Wisconsin. The 13-mile long pipeline would cost $19.5 million and should be in service during the summer of 2003.

Subject:	Sitara EOL Bridge Problem Today

The problem we faced today was due to 2 eol deal packets (2098073, 2099764) not having startdate and enddate.  Missing these 2 tibco message fields caused the bridge to bounce and resulted in the queue to build up while the bridge is starting up. (The bridge takes 2 minute for startup).  Each time these deals are sent/resent, it continuously cause the Sitarar EOLBridge to restart, thus magnifying the buildup of the queue.

The corrective action we are taking at our end is to build a rejection logic when eol packets do not have start and/or enddate.

Now you can enjoy the benefits of convenient online ordering and home
delivery for medications that you take on an ongoing basis - even if
you currently fill these prescriptions at your local retail pharmacy.

Recent enhancements to merckmedco.com now make it even easier for you
to see which of your prescriptions can be filled through Merck-Medco's
Home Delivery Pharmacy.

When you choose to refill a prescription through home delivery, you can:
* Enjoy at-home prescription delivery and the convenience of online
  ordering anytime, from any computer with Internet access.
* Receive a larger days' supply of medication -- usually up to 90
  days -- which saves you trips to the drugstore and in some cases,
  saves you money.
* Check prescription order status, pricing and coverage online.
* Receive e-mails notifying you of your prescription order status.

To see which prescriptions may be eligible for home delivery, simply:
* Click on this link or copy it into your browser window:
  https://host1.merck-medco.com/cgi-bin/Br.cgi?-PW-MyRxRtTb
* Then log in using your email address and password.
* After you click on the "login" button, you'll be presented with our
  "Retail Prescriptions" area, where you can see a detailed history of
  recent prescriptions you filled at a retail pharmacy.

Any medication with a little blue house next to it indicates that the
prescription is eligible for home delivery. When you click on the blue
house, you can compare your current co-payment with the savings you would
receive if you choose home delivery.  If you decide that you would like
to take advantage of home delivery savings, we contact your healthcare
provider and keep you informed every step of the way via e-mail.

merckmedco.com has many ways to help you get the most out of your
prescription drug benefit.  So visit us today and see for yourself!

As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.  

If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.

Hey there -  
So, are we all ready for Halloween?  Mikey and Marissa can't wait!   We've had some practice already with the town parade and a few parties.   I thought they would sleep in the darn costumes!  Mikey is Batman and  Marissa is Pooh Bear.  How are the girls?  Is Pete watching the ball  games?  Mike can't stand it!  He's driving me crazy with his sour  moods!  Will anyone be visiting you for Thanksgiving?  What are your  plans for Christmas?  I hope we can get together this time around.  I  can't wait to see little Caroline!  Bob Spear just had another girl.   He names her Caroline also.  Well, back to the rugrats!

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

The Tyco machine

Today's most successful big growth conglomerate, Tyco continues to produce
-- and confound the skeptics.

By Michael Sivy

Since the early 1990s, Tyco International has compiled a superb track
record. Earnings, cash flow and book value have all increased at a compound
rate of more than 17 percent annually. And recently, those growth rates
have actually accelerated. Earnings could be up as much as 30 percent in
the current fiscal year (which ends Sept. 30, 2002), and average 20 percent
growth over the next five years. So what's not to like?

Fact is, though, Tyco has been the target of ongoing criticism by analysts
and journalists that has weighed down the stock for several years. Much of
Tyco's growth has come from acquisitions, and skeptics keep charging that
these acquisitions somehow inflate earnings (although no one ever seems
able to demonstrate exactly how this inflation occurs).

Criticism of Tyco's results always comes back to one of two charges --
either the company is using its overvalued stock to make deals that
effectively buy earnings or it is taking advantage of overly flexible
accounting laws to inflate its profits by hiding expenses in
acquisition-related write-offs. I have never seen convincing arguments that
either of these things was happening. (And neither did the SEC, when an
analyst's negative report in 1999 prodded the commission to investigate
Tyco's finances.)

Instead, I think that Tyco's strategy is just as it appears. The company
buys relatively inefficient businesses with good basic franchises and then
restructures and cuts costs -- boosting total profits. In the past year
alone, Tyco has acquired or agreed to acquire half a dozen companies.
Businesses currently range from fire-protection systems and printed-circuit
board manufacture to undersea cables and disposable medical supplies.

Acquisition-based growth does carry obvious risks. There has to be a
continuous supply of takeover candidates, the company has to be able to
identify the promising ones and quickly boost profit margins after those
businesses are acquired. But Tyco CEO Dennis Kozlowski, 54, has been
demonstrably good at doing these things for a long time. In addition,
Tyco's cash flow has continued to grow even in years when the share price
was too depressed for the company to buy profits through stock-for-stock
takeovers.

With projected growth of 20 percent a year, Tyco [TYC] certainly looks
cheap. At a current price of $58 a share, Tyco trades at less than 16 times
earnings for the current fiscal year.

It's true that to maintain the maximum rate of earnings growth, Tyco has to
continue to make lots of acquisitions. What I consider more important,
however, is the company's solid potential for internal growth. With a
return on equity that has ranged between 15 and 20 percent, Tyco's existing
businesses should be able to outpace the market's historical return of
around 12 percent a year. That alone justifies a P/E higher than 16. The
additional growth Tyco picks up from dealmaking is just a bonus.

Hello everyone,

My husband Ryan is going to be participating in the American Heart Walk on November 3.  He is walking on behalf of our daughter, Sydney, who was born in May of this year with Congenital Heart Disease.  If anyone would like to sponsor us with a cash donation, we would be very appreciative.  I will be accepting donations today and tomorrow.  This is a wonderful organization whose research saves lives like Sydney's every day.  All donations are matched by Enron and are 100% tax deductible.

Please help this worthwhile cause if you can.

Thanks,

Vicki Versen

Re: System Imbalance Notice

Please be advised that Transco has been experiencing excessive=20
negative transportation imbalances (deliveries in excess of=20
receipts) on its system throughout the month.  Effective=20
immediately, shippers are advised to avoid any additional=20
negative imbalances and return to a balanced position.  Absent=20
voluntary compliance, it may become necessary for Transco to=20
suspend make-up deliveries for the remainder of the month.

Additionally, effective October 26, 2001 and until further=20
notice, Transco will institute more restrictive practices at its=20
pooling points.  Transco will reduce the 4% tolerance currently=20
allowed at its pooling points to 1% or 1,000 dts for Shippers=20
with negatively scheduled imbalances (i.e. deliveries into the=20
pools are less than receipts away from the pools).  Shippers with=20
positively scheduled imbalances at their pools will be held to=20
the 4% tolerance levels. Transco will not enforce these pool=20
imbalance tolerances during the timely nomination cycle; however,=20
Shippers are expected to balance their pools to the limits=20
identified above by the ID2 nomination cycle.  Transco may=20
proactively decrease markets to bring them in line with supplies=20
at pooling points.

If you have any questions, please call Terry Fitch at (713) 215-
3361 or John McGrath at (713) 215-2514.

If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

Listened in on the analyst call this morning.  Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order.

The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  

Specific points:
EES will be a part of the new company.  
Enron assets will be revalued at closing.  
The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  
Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%.
Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  
ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  
Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  
In what was termed a "new approach", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  
Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.  
Lay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'.
All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.
Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure.
Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  
Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.
Dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there.
Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash.  
Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.
Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.
With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.
ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  
BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.
McMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.
Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won't be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.
Watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.
Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger.
Watson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. 
The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron's assets or businesses.  Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.
McMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements.
ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.
The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.
Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.
Initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities.  
McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.
Dynegy's earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.
Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.
ChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'.  (No further clarification given).
Whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the Enron traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.'
Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.
Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.

Give me a call if you'd like me to try to clarify any of these comments.

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

In preparation for the upcoming move to Enron Center South we are moving your Home Directories to a new trading cluster.

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:
This will occur for you this EVENING after 6PM.  
We will need to restart your computer in order to complete this action.  
Please log out or your computer by 6PM, if the machine is not logged off we will reboot the machine in order to complete these actions.  
Save your data before going home this evening.
If you have outstanding circumstances that we should address, please reply to this e-mail and we will change our schedule accordingly.



HERE ARE A FEW OF THE BENEFITS OF THIS ACTION:
Newer, more stable environment
More disk space available for common data
Faster network connections



HOW THIS WILL EFFECT YOU:
If you are a laptop user and have to work at home, you should save any work to your 'C:' drive on the laptop.  DO NOT use the "My Documents" folder.  When you return to work and reconnect to the network, any changes made to files/folders in the "My Documents" folder may be deleted from the laptop.
Laptops reconnecting to the network for the first time will receive a synchronization error. 



RESOLUTION:
Please call the Resolution Center (x3-1411) and they will correct the problem ASAP.
We will have additional Technicians available on the floor if the Resolution Center has any problems.

The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

Trade press, recruiting firms and others recently have made numerous calls to Enron employees seeking information about the company, its employees and other matters.  In some cases, these callers have used false identities, as in, "I'm from the SEC and I need you to provide me with?"

If you receive a call from someone identifying themselves as part of a government organization, please refer the caller to the legal department.  Please refer calls from the trade press and other media inquiries to the Public Relations group.  And otherwise, please treat Enron information as confidential.

Thank you.

Good Morning! 
Bottom line: No Changes - Overall US conditions will return to a more normal late fall/early winter pattern (no Arctic air) over the next 2 days. This pattern will persist through the end of the month. 
For the near term (1-5): Bottom Line - Cooler weather will bring temperatures below normal from the beginning through the middle of the week in the Midwest and from the middle through the end of the week in the East and South. The below normal event will last 3 to 4 days before normal temperatures return. The Rockies and West will be normal to above normal with cooling by the end of the week.
Details: We see some cool anomalies arriving into the Midwest tomorrow, with temperatures in Chicago reaching highs late tonight and the mercury falling through the day tomorrow. By Tuesday, the South and Texas will be in the below normal category, with Dallas overnights in the mid-30s (normal low 43), Houston's low 40s (normal upper-40s) and Chicago will freeze, with a mid-20 overnight. Progressing into the Northeast by wednesday, Philly and New York will get into the below normal category, but 5 or 6 degree anomalies are most likely. Looks like a three day event as it moves easterly and then is followed by moderation.
6-10 Day Bottom Line: Variable conditions continue with a stormy pattern entrenched over much of the nation. Overall temperatures will be normal to cool with very wet conditions. NO strong Arctic air is expected.
Details: A strong storm will push into the West late next week and next weekend bringing heavy rain and snow and temperatures near to below normal. At the same time - the Midwest will warm toward normal with wet conditions developing. By early in the last week of November the strong western storm will push into the central U.S. bringing widespread rain and snow. Behind the system another surge of below normal temperatures will track from the Midwest to the South to the East.
11-15 Day a generally cool and wet weather pattern will persist over much of the nation. While NO Arctic air is clear on the horizon - temperatures on a national average will be cooler than normal and there will be an increased threat for rain and snow. 
So, with normals dropping across the nation, this first cool air anomaly event arriving in the Midwest by Tuesday will elevate the nation's gas demand requirements into the 60 Bcf/d plus regime from here on through the winter. Here's the strip beginning with today:
Sun 	11/18 	47 Bcfd 
Mon 	11/19 	54 Bcfd 
Tue 	11/20 	67 Bcfd 
Wed 	11/21 	69 Bcfd 
Thu 	11/22 	65 Bcfd 
Fri 	11/23 	62 Bcfd 
Sat 	11/24 	61 Bcfd 
Sun 	11/25 	62 Bcfd 
Mon 	11/26 	64 Bcfd 
Tue 	11/27 	63 Bcfd 
Till tomorrow,

Effective Monday, October 22, 2001 the following changes will be made to the Autohedge functionality on EnronOnline.

The volume on the hedge will now respect the minimum volume and volume increment settings on the parent product. See rules below: 

?	If the transaction volume on the child is less than half of the parent's minimum volume no hedge will occur.
?	If the transaction volume on the child is more than half the parent's minimum volume but less than half the volume increment on the parent, the hedge will volume will be the parent's minimum volume.
?	For all other volumes, the same rounding rules will apply based on the volume increment on the parent product.

Please see example below:

Parent's Settings:
Minimum: 	5000
Increment:  1000

Volume on Autohedge transaction			Volume Hedged
1      - 2499							0
2500 - 5499							5000
5500 - 6499							6000

Parts for planes

Honeywell and United Technologies are key subcontractors for the biggest
defense project ever.

By Michael Sivy

NEW YORK (CNNmoney) - After the market closed on Friday, the Defense
Department announced the winner of the largest military project in history
-- the $200 billion Joint Strike Fighter. This plane will be a mainstay for
three branches of the U.S. armed forces as well as the U.K.'s navy and air
force.

Lockheed-Martin was the big winner -- but it wasn't the only one. Boeing,
which also had bid on the project, will likely make parts of the plane. And
a host of other defense companies stand to benefit from subcontracting
deals. United Technologies is virtually a sure thing, since that company's
Pratt & Whitney division was set to provide engines for both the Lockheed
and the Boeing proposals. Honeywell is also expected to be a major
subcontractor.

Both Honeywell and United Technologies look like irresistible buying
opportunities for contrarian investors with a time horizon beyond three
years or so. The stocks got clobbered after Sept. 11 because both companies
make important components used on commercial aircraft. With airlines
reeling from the drop-off in travel, the near-term outlook for that market
is dim.

 From a longer-term perspective, however, demand for aircraft engines and
subassemblies should be just dandy. Even before the war on terrorism, U.S.
military spending was slated to rise over the next few years. And after the
twin towers fell, another $20 billion was added to the budget for the
current fiscal year.

It's also important to realize that the commercial market won't stay
depressed for more than a couple of years. Reporting its biggest loss ever
on Wednesday, American Airlines' parent AMR said that it had cut back
flights by 20 percent and that it was postponing 29 of the 45 new plane
deliveries scheduled for 2002. Air travel will eventually recover, however,
and planes do wear out. That means that delayed deliveries do have to be
made up within two or three years.

United Technologies (UTX: up $2.54 to $57.01, Research, Estimates) gets 36
percent of its earnings from Pratt & Whitney engines and 18 percent from
Sikorsky helicopters and aircraft control systems. The rest comes from
air-conditioning and elevators. Although the stock price has rebounded from
its lows, it's still down 14 percent from its Sept. 10 close. At a current
$57 a share, the stock is trading at less than 16 times next year's
earnings, which are projected to be down slightly from this year's results.
Over the next five years, however, earnings growth could average as much as
15 percent annually.

Honeywell's (HON: up $1.00 to $30.00, Research, Estimates) outlook is much
the same, although the stock is also reeling from the aftershocks of its
failed merger with General Electric. After the deal was stopped by European
regulators, the stock dropped from $50 to $35. It fell again to $24 after
Sept. 11 before rebounding somewhat.

CEO Michael Bonsignore left Honeywell after the merger failed and previous
CEO Lawrence Bossidy was called back into service. Bossidy is making tough
restructuring moves that are hurting current results but will leave
Honeywell even better positioned for the next upturn in aerospace, which
accounts for 40 percent of Honeywell's sales and an even larger percentage
of earnings. Currently $30 a share, Honeywell is trading at 15 times 2002
earnings, which are expected to be flat with this year's. Long-term growth
is projected at 14 percent annually.

Given the tough times that are likely before aerospace rebounds, it may be
a little bit early for both these stocks. But for an investor with a
long-term time horizon, the P/Es look awfully cheap compared with potential
growth rates.

Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. 

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An "Alliance MX turret quick reference guide" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as "Caller ID" and "Voicemail Indication".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:
 
Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	
Weather Channel	12401	801	
CNN Headlines News	12402	802	
CNN Financial News	12403	803	
CNBC	12404	804	
MSNBC	12405	805	
Bloomberg	12406	806	
Financial News Network	12407	807	
CNN	12408	808	
Fox Sports	12409	809	
ESPN1	12410	810	


Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network "in-building" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible "Plug n Play" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.

Keeping an Open forum
We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com

Anticipation

Stocks are rallying on hopes for 2002, despite mixed third-quarter results.

By Michael Sivy

Stocks advanced strongly on Monday, despite mixed news on the earnings
front. At the close, the Dow was up 172 points, or nearly 1.9 percent,
while the Nasdaq composite climbed 2.2 percent. The market seems to be
adjusting to the risk of further terrorist incidents and has taken the
latest anthrax scares in stride -- a marked change from last week.
Investors are also anticipating strong earnings gains next year and appear
unfazed by mixed third-quarter results.

Several leading companies announced third-quarter results or provided
earnings guidance on Monday. The most upbeat news came from tech, where
Applied Materials [AMAT], the leading maker of semiconductor-manufacturing
equipment, outlined impressive growth opportunities at a technology
conference. CEO Dan Maydan said the company's total revenues could double
by 2005. Applied Materials stock jumped nearly 7 percent on the news, and
other tech giants posted strong gains. Intel was up nearly 5 percent on the
day, while Microsoft rose nearly 4 percent.

Financial services also gained despite a pretty dismal report from American
Express [AXP]. The company said that cardholders had cut back substantially
on dining and shopping following Sept. 11. As a result, third-quarter
results were down 60 percent from a year ago and were also substantially
below what analysts expected. Nonetheless, the share price rose $1, or 3.4
percent. Other leading financial stocks also gained: J.P. Morgan [JPM]
advanced 4.2 percent, while Citigroup [C] moved up 2.5 percent.

The Dow's biggest gainer on Monday was Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing, up
more than 5 percent despite a down earnings report. The manufacturer of
Scotch Tape and Post-it Notes reported a 21 percent decline in
third-quarter earnings. Results were in line with expectations, however,
and analysts gave 3M [MMM] good marks for reducing costs.

Among only a handful of losers in the Dow, SBC Communications' [SBC] share
price sank more than 5 percent after the company reported an earnings
decline that was slightly worse than consensus estimates. For the quarter,
profits were down 31 percent because of weakness across the board -- in
business, consumer and wireless services. The company is planning more
layoffs and cost reductions and said that earnings weakness will likely
continue well into next year.

Analysts will watch fourth-quarter trends closely because of the importance
of sales during the holiday season. But investors already know business
will be lousy through the end of the year. The key question is the outlook
for 2002 profits. So don't spend too much time puzzling over third-quarter
reports. What determines where stock prices go from here will be evidence
that supports or undercuts expectations of a strong first quarter. In the
stock market, as in fine dining, anticipation counts for a lot.

Wine Picks: Leslie Sbrocco's Cellar Suggestions

Tomorrow is turkey day. If you haven't been to the store
yet, here are some wine ideas to speed up your Thanksgiving
Day shopping.

2000 Geyser Peak Winery, California, Gewurztraminer
$10 - A real crowd-pleaser. With its floral, juicy
character, this slightly sweet white captures the essence of
California gewurztraminer.

2000 Villa Mt. Eden, Coastal, Pinot Noir
$10 - A silky, strawberry-scented wine. Herbal notes add
interest while soft tannins and barely noticeable oak make
it terrific with turkey.

2000 Clos du Bois, Sonoma, Pinot Noir
$16 - Just plain pretty, this versatile pinot sports a touch
of toastiness, delicate earthy aromas and sweet cherry
flavors.

1998 Edmeades, Mendocino, Zinfandel
$ 16 - Zin can be a huge wine that overpowers food, but not
this one. It's a cool-climate red with zesty acidity, lots
of berry fruit and light tannins.


4. NYC Restaurants: Vietnamese Cuisine That Plays Long Shots
=================================================

Vietnamese may or may not have a word for chutzpah, says
William Grimes, but TanDa has plenty of it, regardless.

$25 and Under: At a No-Frills Pizza Spot, a Perfectionist's
Pie

Finding good pizza is easier than it used to be, though not
if you want just a slice. Luckily, one holdout in Midwood,
Brooklyn stands solidly against the tide.

Subject: TE Critical System Warning


November 27, 2001

TEXAS EASTERN TRANSMISSION, LP (Texas Eastern) continues to operate
under the Critical System Warning issued November 26, 2001.  Based on
anticipated system operations and weather conditions, as stated below,
Texas Eastern is requiring that all customers take immediate and prompt
steps to eliminate excess receipts and conform scheduled receipts to
actual deliveries. This system-wide warning is issued as a result of
actual receipts into the system significantly exceeding actual
deliveries. This Critical System Warning shall remain in place until
further notice.

Weather in the market area continues to be unseasonably mild and
shippers have been filling contract storage inventories in anticipation
of the coming winter heating season.  At this time, Texas Eastern's
storage capacity is approximately 98% full.  As a result, there is
virtually no storage capacity or line pack available for system
operational purposes and Texas Eastern cannot continue to absorb actual
imbalances left on the system.

Due to the critical nature of this situation, and the fact that Texas
Eastern no longer has the ability to further absorb imbalances being
left on the system, Texas Eastern requests that all customers coordinate
with their suppliers the actual quantities received into the system
match actual customer takes in the market area.  No due pipe gas will be
accepted into the system until further notice.

If immediate action does not result in reducing the current volume of
gas being left on the system, Texas Eastern may be forced to issue an
operational flow order ("OFO") requiring actual receipts of gas to match
actual deliveries out of the system, which will be subject to the OFO
non-compliance penalty of $25 per dekatherm.  In addition, and as
provided for in Texas Eastern's FERC Gas Tariff, Texas Eastern will take
any other actions as may be necessary to protect the integrity of its
system, including, but not limited to, suspension of OBA's.

Here are my notes from today's call.  As with Monday, I've focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject.

Enron's business has been grouped into three buckets:  Core, Non-core, and Under Review.  
Core:  Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe, retail energy, pipelines
Non-core:  Broadband, water, and international assets (i.e. EGAS).  Enron has approx. $8Bn in investments in these assets, and they have produced 'dismal' returns.  Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion.  An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets.  
Under Review:  EGM, EIM.  These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability.  Required resource levels are being carefully studied.  Following review, Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates.  
Approximately $800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter.  These include a gas LDC in Brazil, EcoElectrica, and our Indian E&P assets.  
Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of $500MM-1Bn.  Given the current environment, raising equity in the public markets would be 'inefficient', McMahon says.
Short-term liquidity is provided by the $3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago, the $1Bn of new debt, and the $1.5Bn equity infusion from Dynegy.  Longer-term, the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity.  Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt.
McMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles:
Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets.  It was initially capitalized with $950MM of 144a debt and $125MM of equity (raised from Enron and institutional investors).  The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix' assets.  Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 3/17/03 (the 'Enron topup' obligation).  The 3/17/03 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies.  The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water.  As long as Wessex is worth at least $2.6Bn, there will be no Enron topup required.  If we take a 25% haircut to present book value, Enron will have to provide $650MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt.  This $650MM would hit Enron cash, income, and equity balances.  
Osprey contains energy-related assets and 'other assets'.  It was initially capitalized with $2.4Bn of 144a debt and $220MM in equity (ENE and institutionals).  As with Marlin, the entity is an asset-backed structure with an Enron topup guarantee. The debt is supported by a) the assets; b) $1Bn of convertible preferred ENE (convertible into 50MM shares of ENE common); and c) additional ENE common as needed for topup.  Assuming the same 25% hypothetical haircut to current book value, Enron would have to deliver approx. $600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash, income, and equity.  The debt must be retired by 9/17/02, with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with 'large financial institutions'.  The underlying transactions are already on Enron's balance sheet.  McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments.
Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles, McMahon says.
Our 10Q will be filed five days late.  The 10Q will include all of this detail regarding the off-balance-sheet vehicles.
The special committee investigation is still ongoing.  The committee meets 2-3 times/week, sometimes more often.  The outside auditors (D&T) and external counsel hired by the committee are working 'virtually 7 days a week'.  Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation.
McMahon says it's 'way too early to tell' if any asset writedowns are called for.  That analysis is underway, but it will not be complete for some time.  
Osprey contains the European power projects (Trakya and Saarlux), some North American merchant investments, and some Brazilian assets.  
Under the merger agreement, Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than 15% of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval.  However, an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval.  
Broadband is expected to be fully wound up 'sometime over the course of the next year'.  (Did not catch this part clearly).  
The ENE topup obligation for Marlin (represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered) will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing.  
$1.9Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level.  
Current book value of the Osprey assets is $2.1Bn.  
No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the $3.5Bn legal liability clause.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt (this section somewhat unclear).  The underlying transactions represented volumes of 'crude oil and gas'.  The transactions relate to the 'physical movement' of these commodities.  The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled.  
Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes.  He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longer-term products.  Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put long-term deals on hold last week.  Says that our first focus is on getting our short-term business back up to normal levels.  It will be 'a couple of weeks' before we're able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding long-term deals with us.  
McMahon:  There hasn't been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customers--credit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers.  But 'we have seen a return of some of the transactions, some of the flows.'
Whalley says that we're hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week.
Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses.  The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure, he says.  The cuts will certainly be deeper in our non-core businesses.  Whalley then quickly interjects (some might say interrrupts) with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business.  We will be looking at, perhaps, streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments, but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business.
McMahon:  "The company is overlevered; that's a fact."--hence our pursuit of additional equity.
McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week.
ENE had approx. $1Bn in cash as of 9/30, which McMahon points out would be unusual for us.  

As before, give me a call at 3-3055 if you'd like more color.

Subject:	Request for Migration of Sitara EOLBridge into Production

Hello Zhiyong,
	I have implemented an enhancement to avoid the problem of restarting the Sitara EOLBridge when there are missing startdate and enddate.  This fix will take care of this morning's problem.

EOL will be sent a Failed status similar to the following:
	message={EolTransactionId=2101638 TransactionSysDealId="" BridgeEntityName="EOLBridge" Message="Missing StartDate or EndDate" Status="F" BridgeDate="20011025170945CDT"}

I throughly tested the change by sending over 400 sample deals from this morning.  Due to the "Bid Week" window, please approve this  bridge enhancement for tonight's migration.  Thank you.

Subject:	Sitara EOL Bridge Problem Today

The problem we faced today was due to 2 eol deal packets (2098073, 2099764) not having startdate and enddate.  Missing these 2 tibco message fields caused the bridge to bounce and resulted in the queue to build up while the bridge is starting up. (The bridge takes 2 minute for startup).  Each time these deals are sent/resent, it continuously cause the Sitarar EOLBridge to restart, thus magnifying the buildup of the queue.

The corrective action we are taking at our end is to build a rejection logic when eol packets do not have start and/or enddate.

NEW YORK (CNN/Money) - This year has been a nightmare for the airline
industry. The Sept. 11 attacks showed that a fully fueled airplane is the
handiest terrorist weapon short of a portable atomic bomb. Recurrent
airport security failures and last week's crash of an American Airlines
Airbus A300 shortly after takeoff from New York City's John F. Kennedy
Airport made travelers even more anxious. Air traffic is running at least
10 percent below normal seasonal levels.

In the highly leveraged airline industry, profits are sensitive to even
small changes in traffic. So the current drop-off has devastated earnings.
As a result, airline stocks are down 40 percent since early September. This
miserable business climate has also hurt industry suppliers -- particularly
Boeing, the leading U.S. maker of commercial aircraft, which closed at
$35.00 on Friday, up 76 cents. The company is also having problems in other
facets of its business, such as military contracts. The cumulative effect
has been to drive the stock down to its lowest valuation in nearly a decade.

When Boeing acquired McDonnell Douglas in 1997, the company hoped it was
ensuring a lock on the commercial aircraft market by eliminating a rival.
Since that deal closed, however, the European airplane manufacturer Airbus
has become a much tougher competitor. In addition, Boeing overexpanded in
the late 1990s, leading to a sharp drop in operating margins.

Recently, many airlines have been postponing delivery of planes they have
ordered. Continental, for instance, which has been losing as much as $5
million a day since Sept. 11, is taking delivery of 24 planes but may defer
another 47. And on top of all that, Boeing lost an important military
contract to Lockheed Martin last month.

None of these setbacks is permanent, however. Terrorism can be contained,
and public confidence will return. Despite all the scares of the past few
months, flying is still far less risky than getting in a car. Boeing CEO
Phil Condit acknowledges that the company's business may lag for as long as
three and a half years. But a global economic upturn will revive orders
that have been postponed as airlines eventually have to replace aging planes.

When the upturn comes, Airbus will be able to retain some of the market
share it has captured since it topped Boeing in 1999. But the European
consortium has made a big bet on the very largest planes, while Boeing is
using its military know-how to improve the speed and fuel-efficiency on
regular-size jets that account for a larger percentage of the overall
market. This strategy should greatly improve profit margins even if the
company cedes some share to Airbus.

When Lockheed won the Joint Strike Fighter project in October, Boeing lost
out on the military contract of the decade. The deal could ultimately be
worth $200 billion domestically and more in international sales. But the
Pentagon does not want Lockheed to become the sole viable U.S. aerospace
contractor. So Boeing will likely receive extensive subcontracting
opportunities on the JSF and other smaller defense contracts over the next
few years.

Boeing's earnings for 2001 should rise 25 percent from last year's
depressed levels. But results will slip back some next year as deliveries
are delayed. Even allowing for that dip in profits, Boeing's stock is dirt
cheap. At a current share price of $34, Boeing trades at only 11 times next
year's projected earnings. Even more striking, the stock goes for only six
times cash flow. That's about the cheapest that industrial companies ever
get. Since 1997, Boeing has used some of that cash to purchase more than 12
percent of its outstanding stock. And further massive share buybacks are
planned for the next couple of years.

It's true that a full recovery for this stock could take as long as six
years. But Boeing remains an essential company for U.S. commercial and
military aviation. Even partial progress would move the share price
substantially higher. And ultimately, the share price could easily reach
double or even triple current levels. That's the kind of payoff that makes
a long wait worthwhile.

Once again this year, I am leading the BEAR (BE A Resource for CPS Kids) Holiday Fundraiser.  BEAR offers help and hope for abused and neglected children.  This program is more commonly known during the holidays as the "BEARing Gifts" Program, and it assists an average of 800 children a month.  Last year was the first year we called on Enron's Community Relations and our fellow employees to raise money for new bikes, in-line skates and scooters (each child also gets a helmet) for thousands of children under the care of Children's Protective Services.  BEARing Gifts provides holiday gifts to CPS kids who otherwise would have no holiday at all.

Please visit the Enron Lobby on November 5, 6, 7 or 8 between 11:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m., make a donation, and participate in our raffle to win free airline tickets and many other fabulous prizes.  For more information, contact Margaret Doucette at (713) 345-7892 or Janette Elbertson at (713) 853-7906.  

Thank you very much for your support.

You are invited to attend the following presentation: 

PSIM: A Power Simulation Tool

PSIM is a proprietary model developed by Enron Research Group.

?	It takes Power, Gas, Weather and demand information into consideration and 
	uses Monte-Carlo simulation to assess the expected deal value and risk distribution. 
?	It evaluates complex electricity related contracts such
as Full Requirement  and load following contract. 
?	It also provides a valuation tool for power assets and asset management deals.
?	It works for both deal specific or portfolio issues.

In this presentation we will show how the model can be used to deal with various types 
of contracts, explain the model structure and point out further applications.
