The ERMS folder is out of disk space again.  I managed to free up again 2 to 
3gb about 2 weeks ago but we are back down to 450mb.  I found a folder that I 
would like to archive but I wanted to check with you first.  

o:\erms\erms_adm\NYMEX\1999   

I would like to archive about 6 or 7 months out of this folder.  The oldest 7 
are Jan, May, Feb, Mar, Apr, Jun, and Aug.

Otherwise I don't know what else to archive?  I am open to suggestions.

Thanks

Errol,

Yet another deal in which C/P claims deal should have been NYMEX rather than 
Gas Daily.  Can you adjust in TAGG?

Thanks,

Bob,

I have attached an Excel file that values Pete Keavey's Gas Daily swaps and 
options.  In looking at the spreadsheet that you sent, I found these to be 
the most incorrectly valued.  In order to get the valuations, I had book 
administators run calculations in the ERMS system.  These values should 
correlate with how credit valued these deals.  The file consists of a summary 
worksheet for each month and a detail worksheet for each month.  Please feel 
free to call, or have Homer call, with any questions that you have.




Thank you,

Errol McLaughlin, X5-8274

Appreciation: Congradulation to the IT team headed by Jeremy Wong and Francis 
Lim for the outstanding work in revising the Global Rates posting processes 
performed by Eduardo Calderon and Cecilia Cheung. As a result of the 
revisions the following is now possible:
CQG and Telerate is now a back-up for Reuters in posting daily settlement 
prices for options and futures for all commodities.
The revised spreadsheet is more user friendly with the ability to download 
prices immediately after settle prices are known.
Errors can be corrected without IT assistance.
Cross-checking vendors settlement prices for accuracy can be done without the 
usual delays.
Adding and revising commodity terms can now be performed by global rate 
personnel instead of an IT function.
Finally, end-users satisfaction has been improved to nearly 100%.

Again,  thank you guys for a job well done.

Torrey/Dawn -

Do you guys really think this is a reasonable reqeust.  Looks like there are 
in excess of 1500 deals.  If you guys need this field covered,  we need to 
come up with a better process than manually changing deals in TAGG.  Let me 
know how you would like to handle this or if we need to discuss further.  We 
will be happy to assist you any way we can,  short of manually going into 
1500 deals.

Subject: EOL Broker Clean Up

Jeff,

I am attaching a list of EOL transactions that we need your help "cleaning 
up".  With the new Broker-Client application that EOL is bringing on this 
weekend, we need to remove EOL from the broker field.  What we have run into 
is:  there are many deals in Tagg that have EOL in the broker field but no 
EOL number.  We are requesting that risk go through and add the EOL deal 
number to the tagg legs where there is none listed.  The reason for this is 
that if we remove EOL from the broker field and there is no EOL deal number 
reference, then there is no way to no if that deal is an EOL deal.  For audit 
purposes, no one could tie back to the deals.  

Please give this list to the appropriate risk groups (by index).  Let me know 
if you have any further questions.  ALSO, this list is in addition to the 
list that I provided Errol yesterday.

Thank you,
Dawn

Earlier this week I was pleased to announce that Enron's new procurement an=

=20
May 1st the iBuyit Payables system will be activated for all organizations=
=20
supported by Houston-based Accounts Payable processing centers.  The new=20
iBuyit Payables system will increase the efficiency of the accounts payable=

process by capturing invoices as scanned images at a central point of recei=

resolution.=20

In preparation for this transition, there are some simple changes to the wa=
y=20
you currently order and pay for goods and services.  Following these change=
s=20
will ensure that your invoice is correctly processed through the iBuyit=20
Payables system.=20

Effective immediately, provide vendors with the following information when=

placing an order and instruct them to reference this information:  =20
*  Company Number or Legal Entity Name
*  Contact Name=20
*  Personal External Identification Number (EID) or Approved Purchase Order=
=20
Number  =20
*  New P.O. Box  (See Below)

What is an EID?=20
An EID is your External Identification Number (EID). This EID number=20
identifies the purchaser and helps route non-purchase order invoices back t=
o=20
the purchaser electronically through iBuyit. =20

Do I need to use an EID for non-purchase orders?
Yes.  When ordering goods and services with a non-purchase order, the=20
purchaser should provide the vendor with the appropriate EID.  It is your=
=20
responsibility to communicate to vendors that an EID is now required for=20
non-purchase orders.

Do I need to use an EID for purchase orders?
No.  When ordering goods and services with an approved purchase order, you=
=20
should provide the vendor with a purchase order number as you currently do.=
 =20


What if I do not know my EID?
All Enron employees are assigned an EID number. If you purchase goods and=

The continued growth of the Enron Europe office and related businesses has 
prompted a change in the management of Risk Assessment and Control (RAC) in 
London.  Effective in early January, 2001, Ted Murphy will transfer to the 
London office and manage the RAC activities which includes credit/market risk 
and underwriting. Ted will continue to manage the Enron Global Market Risk 
activities.  Steve Young, currently managing RAC in London, will begin a new 
assignment within  EBS, also in London.

The Houston Market Risk group will be managed by David Port.

As Enron continues to expand its trading and risk management businesses, it 
is vital that trading and credit policies are administered in a consistent 
and accurate manner across the company.  Hopefully this realignment will 
accomplish that goal.

Please join me in congratulating Ted, David and Steve on their new 
assignments.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets has recently completed the first transaction for a=

transaction was completed via Clickpaper.com on March 14 with a major lumbe=
r=20
buyer in the southern United States. This represents the first online fixed=
=20
price transaction contract in the industry. With the growing volatility in=

the lumber industry, the availability of a long-term fixed price product=20
provides companies with another opportunity to mitigate their exposure.=20
Additionally, this transaction represents the convergence of Enron=01,s=20

In addition, EIM has announced that it has completed its acquisition of the=

Quebec City, Canada newsprint mill and related assets from Daishowa Forest=
=20
Products Ltd. In July 2000, Enron purchased Garden State Paper, a recycled=
=20
newsprint mill located in Garfield, NJ. The acquisition of the Daishowa mil=
l=20
now positions Enron as the seventh largest producer of newsprint in North=
=20
America. The Daishowa mill in Quebec City will now be called Papiers=20
Stadacona. The new name has great historical significance to the local=20
community in Quebec City. When Jacques Cartier first explored the mouth of=
=20
the St. Charles River in 1535, the aboriginal people living there referred =

the village as Stadacona. This is now the site of modern-day Quebec City.=

Deal QQ9854 does not become a NX3 swap until after Dec. 21, 2001, if it 
assigned.  Before then it has to be booked as a swaption expiring on Dec 21, 
2001.

Thanks,

Sharon,

Robin Rodrigue and I tried to give you a call, but your voice mail says that 
there is no message recorded.  We looked at the October P/L and could not 
find an "Other" column with $9.2MM in it.  If you could, please give Robin a 
call at X5-7478, and she will be happy to answer your questions about this.

Thanks,

Errol

Li,

I will get with Errol and see what we can pull together.  I will get back 
with you when I get a better indication on how long this process will take.

I will also try and include Errol's counterpart in Crude to help with those 
prepays.

Subject: Prepay deals

Hi, Eric,

This is Li Sun from Research Group, it was my pleasure meeting you yesterday. 
Since we basically went through Chase deal structure, but deal structure 
varies from each other. Just as Eric Moon said, one deal with Cage is gone 
now. I have the whole list of prepays which I gave it to you yesterday, could 
you explain to me the basic structure of each? For example, for the Chase 
deal, the net exposure of ENA is cash inflow of $300MM upfront and cash 
outflow of fixed $4 times fixed quantity of gas over time. In this deal, our 
commodity position is perfectly hedged, in other words, Enron is not exposed 
to commodity price risk. The only risk I can think of is credit risk from the 
third party. Will you please have the similar chart for each prepay deal? 
That will be very very helpful for me to understand what is Enron's exposure. 

Kevin and I talked to Errol who is keeping risk book today, unfortunately he 
doesn't know much about the structure of each deal. I will really appreciate 
if you could provide me some hint.

Thanks a lot!

Li

FYI.  Pay special  attention to what Ramesh says about the

Burton,
The following spreadsheets were still loaded from the ng_directory. Rock did 
call me saying that some pipe option spreadsheets were not loading through 
the new process and when I checked it seemed like a network problem and asked 
him to run it again and it seemed to be OK.

With the new process, there is no need for double quotes around the curve 
code and counterparty code columns anymore. This has been automatically taken 
care of since we process from the spreadsheet itself. This was the original 
problem around the pipe option spreadsheets which we discovered yesterday and 
the reason why the numbers did not match between the old and new processes.

I also noticed that INTRA-NORTHEAST-PHY was officialised 4 times - 2 times in 
a row in quick succcession.

I would like Rock or Robin to load these spreadsheets once again during the 
day with Virendra or me as early as possible. We have been consistently been 
able to load these into the test data bases.

The ng spreadsheet also has a quoted price curve code. It should not take any 
time to convert these spreadsheets over.

The ft_northwest sheet seems to be fine - just that it was put into the ng 
directory. Please advise them not to use this directory anymore. Any NT based 
directory will give much better response.

The surprises are the rll and the plastics text files. I thought these were 
the first to go the new spreadsheet format.

Brian Gillis was able to load his spreadsheets successfully through terminal 
server from Calgary yesterday.

Regards,
Ramesh

To Everyone,

The following are revisions to the final report for April 2001.  I am 
providing details here, and the updated report is also attached.  

Tom Brown Resources Ltd., CP ID 96309 is the result of an amalgamation with 
Stellarton Energy Corporation, CP ID 64040.  Stellarton Energy Corporation 
will be inactivated on 05/01/01.  Have Certificate of Amalgamation and 
Articles of Amalgamation in hand.

Please also note that the Western Area Power Administration-"Upper Great 
Plain" record, CP ID 81177, will be corrected to read "Western Area Power 
Administration-"Upper Great Plains Region".  The record that was overlayed 
per the report, CP ID 35194, will be inactivated as a duplicate record.  
These changes have been included on this revised report and the changes have 
been made in GCP today.  These are branch locations by geographic area of the 
US Dept. of Energy, and there is no documentation for these changes.

I have also just received a name correction that may as well be included in 
this report -
      From Greer Comm. of Public Works, CP ID 36393, to Commission of Public 
Works, City of Greer




Please call me with any questions or concerns.

Thanks,
Cheryl x33103

Homer,

I just left you a voicemail regarding the natsource study.  We have been able 
to pull in the basis and price curves, but we are having trouble getting the 
gas daily curves for June to come in correctly.  I.T. is looking into this 
issue and will have us an answer soon.  Email me and let me know where I can 
save a file out to you with the curves we do have.  The file is too large to 
Email.

Thank you,

Errol McLaughlin, X5-8274

Errol,

We are trying to make sure that everyone that is trading options with us off 
line are aware that we have both GD and Price Options on EOL.  Do you have a 
list of companies that are trading with us? If not a post ID would suffice.  
I still have some queries that I can run from my risk days.  Thanks for your 
help.

Important Reminder for ENA Employees

ENA will be rolling out the new Concur Technologies XMS Expense Management 
System March 1, 2001.

XMS will replace the Excel Spreadsheet currently submitted to request expense 
reimbursement. PLEASE NOTE: Those people/teams who have not received training 
are still able to submit reports as before, but teams within ENA are asked to 
transition to XMS as soon as possible following the March 1 target. The 
deadline to transition to XMS is April 1, 2001.

There may be a number of ENA administrative assistants who have already 
received hands-on classroom training and are able to submit both their own 
reports and the reports of those people they support.

If you or your administrative assistant need to be trained on XMS, there are 
several options available:

1. XMS Demo
One or more XMS demonstrations had been scheduled in the month of February. 
These demonstrations will give an overview of XMS functionality but will not 
offer hands-on training. 

2. XMS Classroom Training
Please call Maggie Cruz at 3-1816 regarding XMS Training.

3. LEAP online Self-tutorial
Select the following link to access this LEAP self-tutorial.

http://spr2lp1.enron.com/leap_templates/leap_le/login.asp

4. Online documentation
Select the following link to access the written documentation on XMS from 
Concur Technologies.

 http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/xmscheatsheet.doc

Please visit the ISC intranet site for the complete list of documentation on 
XMS.  
XMS also offers an online tour the first time a user logs on.


If you are not able to log into XMS please call the ISC helpdesk 
(713)345-4SAP.

If you have questions about how to use XMS or how to set up 
profiles/workflow, call the Tech Support hotline (713) 853-1411.

Hi Errol & Sherry,

We received confirmations for the above referenced
deals from Paribas (they confirm us) and Paribas' confirm
differs from what we show in TAGG.  Paribas' trader, Herve,
says that he spoke with John Arnold after the deal was done 
and changed the price from 8.15 to 8.14 and the index from
Gas Daily to NYMEX.     TAGG still reflects the terms that
EOL has.  

Can one of you please find out if John Arnold agreed to these
changes, and if so, can you make the necessary changes
to TAGG?  

Let me know.
Thanks a lot,
Diane

The ERMS folder is out of disk space again.  I managed to free up again 2 to 
3gb about 2 weeks ago but we are back down to 450mb.  I found a folder that I 
would like to archive but I wanted to check with you first.  

o:\erms\erms_adm\NYMEX\1999   

I would like to archive about 6 or 7 months out of this folder.  The oldest 7 
are Jan, May, Feb, Mar, Apr, Jun, and Aug.

Otherwise I don't know what else to archive?  I am open to suggestions.

Thanks

In order to better align our engineering and operations capabilities with t=
he=20
commercial businesses they support, we are pleased to announce the followin=
g=20
organizational change will be effective immediately.  A new business unit,=
=20
Enron Engineering and Operational Services (EEOS), is being formed which wi=
ll=20
include our existing operations in Enron Engineering and Construction Compa=
ny=20
(EE&CC), Operational Energy Corporation (OEC), and National Energy Producti=
on=20
Corporation (NEPCO).

Brian Stanley, as President and Chief Executive Officer, and Keith Dodson, =
as=20
Chief Operating Officer will provide the leadership for this new=20
organization, reporting to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale=20
Services.  NEPCO will continue to operate as a stand-alone business under=
=20
John Gillis, President.

With the majority of EE&CC and OEC=01,s activities focused on assets and=20
projects which are in Wholesale Services, this will better align the effort=
s=20
of EEOS with the commercial businesses it supports.  While EEOS will be a=
=20
stand-alone unit within Enron Wholesale Services it will work very closely=
=20
with and have direct accountability to the business units it supports.

This realignment also centralizes our engineering and operations capabiliti=
es=20
in a single business segment and should ensure that innovation and best=20
practices are shared and implemented across our many operations and will al=
so=20
allow for better identification of priorities and more effective allocation=
=20
of resources to these projects.  Consistent with this approach, Development=
=20
Engineering will have dual reporting to both EEOS and the business units=20
which they support. =20

With an extensive and varied portfolio of assets around the world and a wid=
e=20
variety of new development opportunities available to Enron, it is critical=
=20
that we continue to maintain the best in class capability to design,=20
construct, commission, and effectively manage and operate Enron=01,s assets=
 on a=20
global basis.

This new global business unit should insure that we will continue to enhanc=
e=20
these demonstrated capabilities and provide us with a sustainable advantage=
=20
as we advance our business strategy around the world.

Please join us in congratulating Brian and Keith on their new assignments.

Mark Frevert & Dave Delainey

Dear Errol,

I'm sorry for the delay. As mentioned in my previous email, your prize was 
requested to be
delivered out late December. However, it seems that there was a confusion on 
our vendor's side
regarding the shipment. I'm checking on it at the moment and will work my 
best to resolve the
problem asap. We seek you kind understanding and patience on this matter and 
will let you know
once the problem has been resolved.
Thanks and though it's already 10days past.. Happy New Year!



Regards,

FYI:  there may be a dup in the system from December.

Dutch is checking it out on his end and Jennifer is looking into why it may 
have been settled last month w/ no questions.

It looks like Jean verballed a non-brkerd deal that should have been brkered 
but the deal was never "actioned".
And Bianca verballed the bkered trade, which was "actioned" and then removed 
after it was corrected.

Thanks,
Sheetal

Can either one of you help me...

Calpine- does not know Deal QF1735.1-traded by John Arnold.

Deal QF1336.1 is the exact same trade terms, but is brokered through GFI and 
traded by Mike Maggi.

Calpines thinks these are duplicate trades-and only knows the QF1336.1
Their trader is Thomas McAndrew @ 713 830-8640

Calpine has short-paid by 136,990 due to this trade.

Please let me know if the trade by John Arnold is valid-
Thanks so much

let me hear from you.  Thanks.  

To refresh your memory, these two deals were done on Dynegy Direct, but only 
one was on the report  I pulled up.  I also called Dynegy and they only know

To further the process of reaching the stated objectives of increasing Enro=
n=20
America=01,s Velocity of Capital and associated Return on Invested Capital,=
 we=20
have decided to create a Capital Book. The Capital Book will have no profit=

f=20
creating this book is to ensure that all transactions within Enron Americas=
,=20
with any form of capital requirement, are structured correctly and are=20
allocated the appropriate cost of capital charge.=20

The previous numbers used in the Business Plans at the beginning of this ye=
ar=20
will remain for all transactions in place and where we hold assets.=20
Therefore, on any assets currently held within each business area, the=20
capital charge will remain at 15%. Internal ownership of these assets will =
be=20
maintained by the originating Business Unit subject to the Internal Ownersh=
ip=20
Policy outlined below.

The cost of capital associated with all transactions in Enron Americas will=
=20
be set by Joe. This process is separate and apart from the current RAC=20
process for transactions which will continue unchanged.

Capital investments on balance sheet will continue to accrue a capital char=
ge=20
at the previously established rate of 15%. Transactions which are structure=
d=20
off credit will receive a pure market pass through of the actually incurred=
=20
cost of capital as opposed to the previous 15% across the board charge.=20
Transactions which are structured off balance sheet, but on credit will be=
=20
priced based upon the financial impact on Enron America=01,s overall credit=
=20
capacity.

On transactions that deploy capital through the trading books, the Capital=
=20
Book will take a finance reserve on each transaction, similar to the way th=
e=20
Credit Group takes a credit reserve. This finance reserve will be used=20
specifically to fund the capital required for the transaction. As noted=20
above, the Capital Book will have no budget and will essentially charge out=
=20
to the origination and trading groups at actual cost.

By sending market-based capital pricing signals internally, Enron America=
=01,s=20
sources of capital and liquidity should be better optimized across the=20
organization.=20

 As a follow-up to the recent Enron Corp. memorandum forming Enron Wholesale 
Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services 
Legal Department.

 The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the 
legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed 
the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve 
greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

 To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will 
include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor, 
Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron 
Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, Enron Global Assets.

 The organization chart for the EWS Legal Department is attached.  More 
comprehensive organization charts will follow for each group.

Mark Frevert and Mark Haedicke

Deutsche Bank has gotten back to me and is vacillating on what they want to 
do with the Bankers Trust trades.  In particular, they haven't thought 
through what they want to do with the online trades, don't like on online 
documentation, and now they think they may want to do a full novation of the 
trades once they decide how to resolve this.  So, until we hear back from 
them (they said in about a week), just let the Bankers Trust financial trades 
and master sit.

The previous two nights I have attempted to split out the Positions and P&L 
as we discussed.  I now feel confident in the Positions part of this process 
(Mike's swaps in the Exotic book,  new blotters, etc.).  The P&L portion of 
the process has been significantly more difficult, but after working through 
last night , I will have the P&L completely split out by the end of today.

Thanks for your help & patience,

Errol

Thanks to all of you, Enron North America has had an outstanding year in=20
2000.  Some of the more notable accomplishments include:
a) 100% plus increase in EBIT from 1999 actuals to 2000 forecast;
b) significant rationalization of the balance sheet including the sale of t=
he=20
(i) Wind River/Powder River gathering assets, (ii) East Coast Power=20
generating assets, (iii) HPL and (iv) five of the six Eastern Peakers;
c) ENA is the leading energy merchant by a factor of two;
d) physical electricity volume grew by 34% YTD 1999 to YTD 2000 forecast;
e) natural gas volumes grew by 82% YTD 1999 to YTD 2000 forecast;
f) 500% growth in daily transactions from November 1999 to November 2000 du=
e=20
to the highly successful Enron OnLine distribution channel; and
g) ENA reaching its 25% ROCE target.

These are truly outstanding accomplishments and our expectations for growth=
=20
and opportunity in Enron North America for 2001 are consistent with that=20
success.  In order to reach these goals, we felt it necessary to re-align a=
=20
number of our organizations. A number of these changes are completed.  The=
=20
goals of such re-alignment include:
a) increase overall productivity with the goal to ensure that every employe=
e=20
is in a position to contribute regardless of skill set;
b) increase overall market coverage, deal flow and information generation=
=20
with the goal to increase bid/offer income, increase the velocity of deal=
=20
flow, improve customer coverage and promote quality information transfer to=
=20
our trading organization;
c) increase deal quality and earnings quality with the goal to (i) allocate=
=20
our resources towards the best transactions and (ii) significantly increase=
=20
our =01&mid-market=018 originated transactions in our portfolio;
d) promote real time decision making and a closer tie between our trading a=
nd=20
origination (mid-market and structured) organizations in order to better=20
align those functions to reduce the amount of un-productive internal focus;
e) increase the overall velocity of the capital being utilized consistent=
=20
with our goal of a 25% plus return on capital employed; and
f) identify and recognize a host of new leaders in the organization that ar=
e=20
critical to meeting our goals next year.

With these objectives in mind, patterned after the successful business mode=

in Calgary and Portland, effective immediately the following changes are=20

a) East Power =01) a single East Power Team incorporating trading, mid-mark=

The following deals are being disputed by Reliant Energy Services. TAGG is 
showing these deals as Gas Daily, but the counterparty states that they 
should be changed to Nymex trades. They also stated that they were told by 
Mike Maggi that the deals would be changed to Nymex deals:

 In order to better align our resources with the business units we support, 
we are designating the following individuals as operating company leads with 
primary responsibility for designing and implementing government and 
regulatory affairs support for the operating companies and to serve as 
primary contacts for the operating companies:

  EBS: Scott Bolton & Donald Lassere

  EES: Harry Kingerski

  ENA: Jim Steffes

 In addition to supporting the operating company organizations, these 
individuals will report to Rick Shapiro.  Jim Steffes will retain his 
responsibilities for regulatory risk assessment and will continue to report 
to Steve Kean in that capacity.

 There are already numerous working relationships and points of contact 
between government affairs and the operating companies.  The designation of 
Scott, Donald, Harry and Jim as leads does not change that.  Rather, we are

GOOD NEWS:

It is a go!!!

-  Per Susan Bailey, we have received executed docs from Aquila and plan to 
have the assignment effective tomorrow.  In addition, EOL is all set up so 
all financial trading should occur out of Aquila Risk Management beginning 
tomorrow.

Thanks for everyone's help !!

Good News/Bad News


Good News (First):
Aquila, with much help from our EOL group, has set up all of their users to 
begin trading tomorrow.

Bad News:
At this time, we have not received the executed assignment from Aquila.  I 
just spoke to Angela (their contracts person) who told me their VP has yet to 
sign the assignment.  Until we get the docs in, Utilicorp will continue to be 
the counterparty.

I will keep you all updated.

To All:

As most of you all know by now, Utilicorp is assigning their ISDA to Aquila 
Risk with a proposed effective date of tomorrow Friday, Feb 9.  My concern 
with this is if the ISDA is executed with an effective date of Feb 9, then we 
are not going to be able to trade financially out of Utilicorp including 
EOL.  They are having trouble setting up/transferring their EOL users, 
although I have been assured by my Credit contact and the Contract Person at 
Aquila that the assignment is still going to be executed with this effective 
date.  If this is the case, then tomorrow Utilicorp will be shut down on EOL 
and if they have not set Aquila Risk up correctly, they will not be able to 
trade on EOL at all financially. I have notified my contacts of this scenario 
and they are comfortable with this.

I will keep you all updated as I hear more throughout the day.

Russell

John:

Attached is the vol. skew that was used for the current day (April 10) calc;
the prior day (April 9) calc. still used the one you loaded on Mar. 30. 

i.e., the official post_id 1101853 used the April 10 vol. skew for current 
day but the Mar. 30 vol. skew for the prior day valuations.

I am excited to announce a major initiative called iBuyit, a new online 
purchase and payment tool.  Each of you will be able to use iBuyit to order 
or approve purchases from pens to pipe and cable to computers.  Our Global 
Strategic Sourcing (GSS) and Global Accounting groups have teamed up with 
each of your Business Units to build a tool designed to meet your specific 
needs.

Special iBuyit features include:
? An eCatalog to help you quickly find the items you need
? Shopping baskets to store your purchases
? Simple recurring purchases 
? Automatic routing of invoices for coding and approval

iBuyit will be implemented in stages across ETS, EBS, EES, EWS, Corporate and 
Europe during 2001.  

Over the next few months, you will be hearing more about iBuyit from your 
business unit leadership, including what it can do for you and when you can 
expect to use it.

Subject: EOL / Tagg Broker Field

In order for EOL to support the Broker Client Application, we are requesting 
that EOL be removed from the broker field in Tagg on all previous EOL 
transactions.  We would like this "sweep" to be performed on Thursday 
evening, if possible.  What this means to end users is that they will no 
longer be able to query on the broker field to find EOL deals in Tagg.  The 
only way to search for EOL deals in the future will be to query on the EOL 
transaction number.

Please communicate this new procedure to your groups.  Also, I don't know if 
Ron/Joe cover the Canada confirmations, if not, please let me know who the 
confirmations contact is in Canada. 

Jeremy/Ron, please let me know if Thursday evening works for you to clean out 
the broker field.

Thank

Jeff-

>From a legal perspective, the traders are not supposed to have the authority 
to let out another entity from an EnronOnline trade. If the trade is the 
result of a system malfunction or some other uncontrollable issue, the 
customer can get with the trader and agree to reverse out an existing EOL 
transaction with an OTC trade, but Commercial should not be letting customers 
out of EOL deals simply because their traders "clicked on the wrong product". 
This is the policy that Mark Taylor and Legal have had in place since the 
inception of EOL.

I'll get with Sheri and Jennifer and we will see what Legal has to say, but, 
if Mike Maggi and/or John Arnold have been verbally allowing customers to 
change these Gas Daily trades in the past, it definitely creates a problem 
from the perspective of trying to hold them to the same trades now. The best 
advise I can give right now is to make sure that John and Mike do not 
continue allowing customers out of their trades simply because they "clicked 
on the wrong product". The legal responsibility for "clicking on the right 
product" lies firmly with the customer and whenever Commercial starts 
allowing them out of that responsibility it can create serious legal problems 
when and if one of these trades comes back to bite them.

Subject: Gas Daily deals in dispute

Torrey - 

We have an issue where some of our traders are letting traders out of EOL 
deals b/c they "clicked on the wrong product."  What happens is we end up 
having two deals in our systems,  and the counterparty has no deals in their 
system.  So when settlement goes out they tend to accept the one in their 
favor and reject the one against them.  We always work it out but as you can 
imagine it is a huge headache from everyone's perspective.  Please advise on 
what we can do to put an end to this practice.

Thanks

The following deals are being disputed by Reliant Energy Services. TAGG is 
showing these deals as Gas Daily, but the counterparty states that they 
should be changed to Nymex trades. They also stated that they were told by 
Mike Maggi that the deals would be changed to Nymex deals:

Sally -

These are the steps that we have taken to insure that the positions the V@R 
engine picks up are correct:

1. Each book adm. now checks his/her own positions that are going into V@R,  
rather than just one check at  a consolidated level.
2. All regional controllers will receive a sheet at the end of the night, 
verifying that all books are officialized.

Subject: Counterparties w/ Master Agreements with ECC

I have received an updated list of the counterparties that have Master 
Agreements with ECC.  There are now about 40 counterparties that fall under 
this category.  What seems to be happening is that these counterparties are 
hitting on US gas products on EOL and are not bridging into Tagg correctly.  
Currently, they are bridging as one leg between ENA and the counterparty.  
The problem arises during settlement because ENA cannot settle with these 
counterparties, only ECC can.  An example of what Risk is doing to the 
products after bridging is Tagg#Q79131 / EOL #555401.

RISK:  We need risk to verify that anytime, without exception, all companies 
with Master Agreements with ECC that hit a US product must be booked as two 
legs:  leg one booked between ECC and the counterparty with risk assignment 
of FT-US/CAND-ERMS; leg two flipping the risk out of FT-US/CAND-ERMS to the 
appropriate risk book.  Also, risk needs to verify that this is only for 
Financial Swaps and not Physical deals.  

IT:  It is my understanding that a few counterparties are set up to be booked 
correctly (with two legs).  The list is now up to 40 counterparties and will 
most likely be updated on a consistent basis.  Is this something that Tagg 
Maintenance can handle?  Guidelines need to be set up for Risk/Global to 
instruct IT when new Master Agreements are created with counterparties so 
logic can be adjusted accordingly.

Does a meeting need to be set up to elaborate on these issues?  Are there any 
further issues that need to be addressed concerning ECC Master Agreements?    
(i.e. What about when a counterparty with ECC Master Agreement hits a 
Canadian product out of the Houston office?)  
Please respond with your thoughts on this subject.

Thank you,
Dawn

John:

The reason for the large Vega numbers on the TopPage report, while there were 
no corresponding changes in the Volatility curves, is due to the change in 
the mid. price for the current day versus the prior day. The corresponding 
volatility skews that are added to the vols. for the 2 days is causing the 
large vega numbers.

For example, for deal number QV5087.2 (exp. date 01-Jan-2002):

  Current Day  Prior Day
Mid. Price 5.885   5.772
Strike Price 3.5   3.5
Mid - Strike 2.385   2.272
Vol.  0.555   0.555
Vol. Skew 0.03816   0.03635
Actual Vol. 0.59316   0.59135

Option value for prior day using current day's vol. =  7,616,935  
Option value for prior day using prior day's vol.     =  7,547,238 
Vega                =  69,697

Thank you,

We are pleased to announce that Dave Duran will replace Janet Dietrich to 
co-lead the East Power Wholesale business at Enron.  Dave will continue to 
run the highly successful Generation Investments business.

The East Power team will continue to have a single income statement and joint 
accountability toward its financial goals as was set out in the 
reorganization in late 2000.

Within Dave's Generation Investments group; Michael J. Miller will lead the 
effort to acquire new QF projects, Chuck Ward will lead the restructuring 
efforts on existing QF projects, and Carl Tricoli will lead the initiative to 
develop and market capital products to IPP's.  In addition, Mitch Robinson 
will lead a new initiative to evaluate opportunities with coal fired 
generation.  Dave and Kevin Presto will attempt to leverage the Generation 
Investments business and the Origination activities through a tighter 
integration between the two groups.

Dave has over nine years of direct experience in gas and power origination at 
Enron including an outstanding performance over the last couple of years 
building the Generation Investments business.  He also spent two years 
managing Enron's Retail Gas Marketing business in Dublin, Ohio.

The East Power group has had a great start to the year and we feel confident 
that the leadership team of Kevin and Dave will lead to continued success.

Hey Sherry,

Here is the spreadsheet with the Duke Energy Marketing deals that I need you 
to flip to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book as soon as possible.  I need to get an 
invoice to them within the next few hours as they need to settle with us on 
Monday.



If you could go through your book and flip any deals between ENA and Duke 
Energy Marketing LP to the P& book to settle with ECC that would help solve 
some problems.  Please let me know if you have any questions on this.  Just 
to let you know, Carole Frank took notes this morning when I walked her 
through running that download in TAGG.  It can be done for any counterparty 
in any book, so you can also run it for Duke Energy Marketing LP as well.

Thanks
Stacey

A payment test file was sent to the bank in error and, as a result, a deposit 
was posted on Monday, July 10, 2000.  This impacts only employees who utilize 
direct deposits (ACH) and are paid semi-monthly.

To correct this situation, on Tuesday, July 11, 2000 a withdrawal of the 
amount deposited will be processed.  Your bank may not post this transaction 
until Wednesday, July 12, 2000.

If you have any questions, please call (713) 345-5555.  We apologize for any 
inconvenience.

Also,  I had at least 5 people here past midnight on Thursday.  Let me know

As you might be aware,  Susan Scott (the book admin for the pipe option book) 
was forced by system problems to stay all night Wednesday night and until 200 
am Friday  in order to calc my book.  While she is scheduled to rotate to the 
West desk soon,  I think we need to discuss putting two persons on my book in 
order to bring the work load to a sustainable level.  I'd like to meet at 
2:30 pm on Monday to discuss this issue.  Please let me know if this time 
fits in your schedules.

Thanks,

We are testing the new version of the Asian model from Research, and there 
are a couple of issues
we need to resolve with Paulo.  We should have a version ready for your 
testing by the end of this week.  
I will inform you and Errol when we complete our testing.

It is amazing and yet not surprising how much Enron has accomplished in the=

first six months of this year. You continue to make it happen.  We recogniz=
e=20
that you work hard every day to accomplish Enron=01,s business goals, and w=
e are=20
pleased that many of you have shared in the company=01,s financial success=
=20
through Enron stock options.=20

As you may know, the current employee stock option program (also known as t=
he=20
All Employee Stock Option Program or AESOP) began in 1994 and provided valu=
e=20
to participants through 2000.  Employees who have participated in this=20
program from its inception have realized a 1,119% increase in the value of=
=20
their stock options (assuming a stock price of $70) over the life of the=20
program.  =20

Enron stock options are a valuable part of your total compensation package=
=20
and a contributing factor to your performance and to Enron=01,s continued=
=20
success.  Therefore, the Enron Executive Committee and the Compensation and=
=20
Management Development Committee of the Enron Board of Directors have decid=
ed=20
to continue to offer stock options as a part of your compensation package.

On May 1, 2000, the Committee approved an employee stock option program for=
=20
calendar years 2001 - 2005 (EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program).  =
It is=20
expected that EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will be granted,=
=20
effective on or about December 29, 2000, for those employees who are eligib=
le=20
on that date (please see note below).  The new program, which is subject to=
=20
final approval by Enron=01,s Board of Directors, is as follows:

? EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will give stock options to=20
eligible full-time and part-time regular employees in domestic and=20
international companies/locations.
? The grant of non-qualified stock options will equal 25% of annual base=20
salary (5% of annual base salary for each year of a 5-year period) on=20
December 29, 2000. (Salary calculation and value may vary in some=20
international locations.)
? The Board will grant the stock options on December 29, 2000.
? Eligible employees hired in subsequent years will receive a prorated gran=
t=20
of stock options.

Why commit your talent and energy to Enron?  EnronOptions =01) Your Stock O=
ption=20
Program, among other good reasons=01( that=01,s why.

In the coming weeks, you will be receiving more details about EnronOptions =
=01)=20
Your Stock Option Program.  To provide information and answer your question=
s,=20
we will introduce a special link on the Human Resources web-site, host=20
several eSpeak sessions and continue to communicate with you on a regular=

Note: In addition to final approval by Enron=01,s Board of Directors, grant=

There is a 30 minute meeting every morning on the 28th floor at 8:30 about 
systems issues from the prior night and to discuss what books were not 
officialized.  I have gone to this meeting this week, and I think that we 
should always have a representative in the meeting.  Here is what I propose:  
We alternate weeks going to this meeting.

Week of :
Dec. 4   - Jeff Gossett
Dec. 11 - Darron Giron
Dec. 18 - David Baumbach
Dec. 25 - Will Kelly
Jan. 1    -  Kam Keiser
Jan. 8    - Errol Mclaughlin

And then we will start over again.
If you can not go,  make sure that someone goes in your place.

Thanks

Irena and Elizabeth -  Can you please add these daily meetings to the 
appropriate calender?

Thanks

Errol,
I noticed a small mistake late last night.  Their is West orig on your Orig 
schedule that is not 0.  It is already on the west schedule so the value just 
needs to be taken off your orig schedule tab.  

The cells that need to be set = to 0 are p41 and q41

thanks,
brad

Subject: re: Gas Daily options revaluation

This is to inform you that we are rolling out changes to the Gas Daily option 
pricing model.  Currently the system is not properly pricing index puts and 
calls at locations with gas daily index premiums or discounts (puts and calls 
are priced at the same level no matter what the index).  The change will 
result in raising call values/lowering put values at locations with index 
premiums and the opposite at locations with index discounts.

In addition, index plus/minus option deals (for example index -1.00 puts) - 
which are currently incorrectly priced flat to the index option (the index 
-1.00 put is priced flat to the index put)- will be accurately priced to 
reflect the difference in strikes.

If  anyone has any questions please call me at  3-6731.

Thank You,

Larry May

Dawne,

The options should go to NG-PR-OPT, but the underlying swap should continue 
be between NG-Price and NG-Exotic.

Thanks,

With this new book, you want the option to go to NG-PR-OPT (it is going to 
NG-PRICE now) and the underlying swap to be between NG-PRICE and NG-PR-OPT?

Please confirm!

be asked for this information in 5,000 different ways in the next few days.  
I want to thank all of you for your help on this.  It is vital that these

I had the same problems with this that you all do.  That is why I told 
Gossett that if this is something that has to happen, then only people like 
Joe Hunter and 1or 2 others should be allowed to change the c/p names ONLY.

I don't thing that is an option.  If we give you the ability to change names 
then you also have the ability to change other parts of the deals.

Jeff,

For a long time John and Mike have been letting counterparties who 
accidentally click on the Gas Daily stack change the deals to NYMEX swaps.  
The counterparty would let John/Mike know and then they would tell us.  In 
addition, at the end of the month, we would get calls from settlements and 
credit telling us (per the counterparty) that there were more deals that 
needed to be changed from GD to Nymex than we had changed.  John would let 
them change those deals too.

On Friday we changed some Jan. `01deals with Utilicorp that had been done in 
late November to NYMEX swaps.  Because of the timing there was a P/L impact 
of -$1.3MM.  When John saw this today he asked me what it was, I explained, 
and he stated that what they click on is what they get.  I relayed this to 
settlements and credit and that is why Kim is calling you b/c Reliant and 
Utilicorp are 'upset'.  They claim that they have John and Mike on tape 
letting them out of the GD deals and into NYMEX swaps.

We do not change the actual deals booked by EOL.  We book two new legs that 
create a NYMEX swap and flip out the GD deal.

Errol

Irena,

The team provides us with great service currently.  The only area of 
improvement I can think of regards new-hires.  I need to give you and your 
team a better heads-up when I have new someone coming on.  If we could come 
up with a checklist of everything they need (computers, phones, basic 
supllies, etc.) and have them already at there desk when they start, that 
would help.  I know that the last few people that have come on were last 
minute additions, so there is not much we could have done.  Hopefully, we 
won't have as many space issues in the future.

I really appreciate the work the team is doing currently.  I will work hard 
to give you more lead time when I am adding someone to the group.

Thanks,

Errol

Great news, everyone. For the third consecutive year, Fortune magazine has 
named Enron one of the nation's top employers on its annual "100 Best 
Companies to Work for in America" list.  This year Enron ranks No. 22, up 
from No. 24 last year.

We continue to move up on Fortune's list, which shows that you, our 
employees, believe Enron is a cool place to work.  Thanks to all of you who 
took time from your busy schedules to share your Enron experiences with 
Fortune in its confidential survey.

Can either one of you help me...

Calpine- does not know Deal QF1735.1-traded by John Arnold.

Deal QF1336.1 is the exact same trade terms, but is brokered through GFI and 
traded by Mike Maggi.

Calpines thinks these are duplicate trades-and only knows the QF1336.1
Their trader is Thomas McAndrew @ 713 830-8640

Calpine has short-paid by 136,990 due to this trade.

Please let me know if the trade by John Arnold is valid-
Thanks so much

The deals in the worksheet below have been flipped out.  In the future please 
cc: myself on any of these E-mails and I will make sure they are taken care 
of promptly.  In addition, Laura will be out until Feb. b/c of maternity 
leave and Sherry will be out through Monday -- she is stuck in Arkansas b/c 
of the ice storm there.

Thank you,

Hi guys,

I took the liberty of looking in the NG-PRICE book to see if any deals were 
missed,
and came across a lot.  Here are the deals that need to be flipped to the
FT-US/CAND-ERMS book before 2:00pm Houston time as I need to get invoices
off to the customers today.



There are about 40 other deals in this book that still need to be dealt with 
for January
settlement, but these ones need to be fixed right away.  I've left a phone 
message with
Laura, but haven't heard back yet, and I think that Sherry is still out of 
the office as she
hasn't changed her outgoing message to say that she's in the office.

If there are any problems with this message, please let me know.

Thanks for all your help
Stacey

FYI - The desk heads do not get to see p&l sheets for the floor.  Be careful 
letting them know what you have.  We also wouldn't want Lavorato to find out 
that more people or seeing these reports than he thinks.

We are pleased to announce that Jim Noles, president and chief operating 
officer of Enron Wind, will assume the additional role of chief executive 
officer, effective immediately.  Jim will continue to be based in Houston.

Jim joined Enron Wind as its president in May of this year.  Prior to that 
appointment, Jim was managing director for Enron's Operations Support Group 
of Global Asset Operations and provided operations and maintenance oversight 
and technical assistance to Enron's worldwide facilities.

Previously, Jim worked with Enron International's Asset Management team where 
he formed the North American Asset Management Group to provide operation and 
maintenance services to Enron North America's electricity generation peaker 
plants that entered into service in 1999.  Jim joined Enron in 1995 as vice 
president of Enron Development Corp. to head up its Middle East Regional 
Development team.

Prior to joining Enron, Jim was an international marketer for TRW's Systems 
Integration Group with responsibilities in the Middle East.  Jim served in 
the U.S. Army for 25 years, culminating his career as a Brigadier General.  
His education includes a bachelor's degree from the University of North 
Alabama and a master's of public administration from the University of 
Alabama.

Jim has a solid track record in development, sales, operations, and 
leadership and has had a positive impact on Enron Wind's growth and 
profitability in the short period since joining the company.  Please join us 
in congratulating Jim on his promotion and new responsibilities.

Richard,

Due to the release of the Options Manager in EOL, we need a new UOM set up in 
global for MM-L.  This MM-L implies that the options are traded in lots 
online but need to convert to MMBTU for valuation purposes.  Therefore, 1 
MM-L = 10,000 MMBTU.  Can you please let me know if you need further 
information to set up this Global UOM?

Thank you for your help!  Hope you feel better!

As you are aware, Enron signed an agreement with Blockbuster Inc. last summer 
to launch an entertainment on-demand service.  We announced today that we are 
discontinuing our exclusive relationship with Blockbuster in order to expand 
the offering by developing direct relationships with content providers and 
distribution partners.

We have made tremendous progress toward our goal of becoming the leading 
provider of entertainment on-demand over a digital platform.  We rolled out 
the trial service in Seattle, Portland, Salt Lake City and New York in 
December, and today subscribers are buying movies on-demand using the service 
we created.

However, the exclusive relationship with Blockbuster has not yielded the 
quantity and quality of movies needed to drive demand for this exciting, new 
on-demand service.  Now that we have proven the concept, we want to take our 
service to the next level by adding content and subscribers on an accelerated 
basis.  We feel that this can be best achieved by pursuing entertainment 
on-demand independently.

We intend to initiate discussions with various content providers for 
delivering their content over the Enron platform.  We remain very positive 
about the potential of this business for EBS and Enron and will keep you 
apprised of our progress.

DealBench

Enron Net Works' newest initiative is now online!  

The Product
DealBenchTM is an online platform that enables licensing companies to arrange 
and execute transactions  efficiently and effectively.  Companies that 
license DealBenchTM are able to organize their transaction materials, upload 
documents and other materials to a secure website, invite deal participants 
to view deal materials, host various types of online auctions and manage, 
track and close a transaction online.  
DealBenchTM incorporates five specific business tools that streamline the 
transaction process for licensees:
Document Sharing:   deal-related materials in various formats (Word, 
Powerpoint, Excel, CAD drawings, digital pictures,      etc.) can be uploaded 
for deal participants to view and/or edit.

Auctioning/Bidding:   licensees can design and monitor (in real-time) forward 
or reverse auctions and collect sealed tender      bids.

Multi-media:    customers can present high quality virtual road shows and 
asset descriptions using streaming video.

Secure Communication:  DealLineTM messaging system facilitates one-to-one, 
one-to-many, and many-to-many        communication.

Deal Management:   DealNotesTM  enables customers to monitor the progress of 
their deals using statistics on user      downloads, bidding/auction results 
and user page views.


Applications
DealBenchTM has been used by Enron during bank product syndications, the sale 
of a large portfolio of leases, and the procurement of certain materials for 
the new headquarters building.   Soon, DealBenchTM will also meet the 
collaboration needs of Enron attorneys, facilitate online RFQs and provide 
for the hosting of online datarooms.  

To learn more about DealBenchTM, please join eSpeak on Wednesday October 4th 
when Harry Arora (Vice-President, eCommerce) will answer questions regarding 
this Enron Net Works initiative.  For additional information, please visit 
https://www.DealBench.com (username= guest, password= dealbench) or email 
webmaster@DealBench.com.
NOTE:  If you are unable to execute the above link, please copy the link into 
the address line of your installed browser.

We welcome all thoughts and ideas on how the DealBench platform can be 
utilized to address the needs of Enron's business units.  Further, as the 
platform is available to be licensed externally, please forward new business 
development leads to members of the    DealBenchTM team.

Subject: ERMS folder

The ERMS folder is out of disk space again.  I managed to free up again 2 to 
3gb about 2 weeks ago but we are back down to 450mb.  I found a folder that I 
would like to archive but I wanted to check with you first.  

o:\erms\erms_adm\NYMEX\1999   

I would like to archive about 6 or 7 months out of this folder.  The oldest 7 
are Jan, May, Feb, Mar, Apr, Jun, and Aug.

Otherwise I don't know what else to archive?  I am open to suggestions.

Thanks

With the extension of the PRC to all organizations, questions have arisen=
=20
about the results of this process. This memo provides some details about th=
e=20
PRC process.

First some context:  The key to Enron=01,s success is the increasing qualit=
y and=20
dedication of our talent.  As we continue to attract and retain the very be=
st=20
people, we all have continued to raise the performance bar throughout the=
=20
organization.  At the core of our system are the following principles:

? Hire the best people.
? Provide challenging opportunities.
? Pay well =01( and pay for performance (with bonuses based on merit, not=
=20
entitlement).
? Evaluate performance through a rigorous review process.
? Provide clear feedback and direction to employees.

The PRC is a critical component of our performance management system.  The=
=20
PRC is built on this foundation:

? 360 degree performance feedback.
? Review by a broad group, not just the supervisor.
? A relative ranking of performance across Enron to determine promotions an=
d=20
to allocate bonus money.


In addition to understanding this broad philosophy, we all need to understa=
nd=20
the following details:

? Relative ranking.  Enron uses the descriptors =01&superior=018, =01&excel=
lent=018,=20
=01&strong=018, "satisfactory", =01&needs improvement=018, and =01&issues=
=018 to group all=20
employees.  This year, =01&relative to his/her peers=018 precedes each of t=
hese=20
descriptors. This qualifier confirms what we have done and will continue to=
=20
do in practice; that is, evaluate individual performers against their peers=
. =20
It is possible, therefore, for someone to perform at the same or higher lev=
el=20
compared to prior periods, yet receive a lower rating for the current perio=
d=20
if other employees=01, performance raised the bar.
? Teamwork.  A relative ranking may invite the view that for one employee t=
o=20
gain, others must suffer.  However, feedback is explicitly solicited on=20
teamwork when evaluating each individual=01,s performance.  Anyone who atte=
mpts=20
to gain by withholding information or refusing to collaborate with others i=
n=20
the organization will suffer in a relative ranking on this key performance=
=20
criterion.
? Preferred distribution. In large part, the quality of our workforce has=
=20
been driven by our willingness to make tough decisions. We have consistentl=
y=20
captured business opportunities and overcome obstacles because we have made=
=20
the choices that had to be made in order to constantly improve our employee=
=20
talent base. The preferred distribution (5% superior, 30% excellent, 30%=20
strong, 20% satisfactory, and 15% needs improvement or issues) forces PRC=
=20
committee members to identify those who must improve in order to remain at=
=20
Enron as well as to single out top talent for special recognition. There is=
=20
some flexibility in the system, but every organization must ultimately face=
=20
this difficult question: have we achieved the highest level of performance =
or=20
are there still improvements that must be made? Few, if any, organizations=
=20
adhere exactly to the preferred distribution. Rather, they exercise informe=
d=20
discretion in the individual categories and meet a distribution that reflec=
ts=20
their groups=01, overall effectiveness and need for improvement.
? Communicating Ratings. Everyone rated =01&satisfactory=018 or below shoul=
d know=20
his/her rating. Each organization has determined for itself whether to=20
communicate ratings of =01&strong=018 and above.  In all cases, employees w=
ill=20
receive feedback about their performance against expectations, areas of=20
success, and areas that need improvement.

We hope this answers most of your questions about the PRC process.  We woul=
d=20
like your feedback and ideas on how to improve the PRC process going=20
forward.  Therefore, we will be conducting an eSpeak in the near future, an=
d=20
there will be other methods we will create to let us know what you think.  =
In=20
the meantime, please feel free to consult with your HR Generalist if you ha=

any immediate questions, comments, or concerns.

Hey Johnelle,

It's great to here from you again.  Yeah, I'm over at Enron now.  I manage 
the group responsible for all of the natural gas financial trading risk 
management.  I've been here for a little over a year now.  It's a great job 
and company, but the hours are unbelievable!!!  The family's good.  How are 
Janna, Gina, (sp) and your mom.  I'm afraid to ask --- how old is Janna now?  
When you tell me, I'm going to feel really old!!  Tell everyone I said, 
'Hi'.  The NYMEX was only open for half the day, so I'm taking advantage.  
Call me when you get a minute!!

Errol,

There are two trades that were done with Mirant Americas through 
Intercontinental Exchange.  TAGG does not reflect these trades.  I faxed the 
broker statements to Sherry D. and she stated that she forwarded them to 
you.  Trade dates were on Nov. 13th and Nov. 14.  I also asked Joe Hunter to 
check into this and he stated that he had spoken to you some time last week 
or the week before and stated that you would be getting back with me on the 
TAGG deal numbers.
 
When I querried TAGG this morning selecting Intercontinental Exchange as the 
broker, no deals were found.

Can you please let me know the deal numbers as these trades need to be 
settled as soon as possible.

Thanks,
Mechelle

Frank,

After looking the packet over in detail, I found the questions to be a great 
tool, especially the ones aimed at the 'soft skills'.  Previously when 
interviewing people I always struggled for a way to ask these type of 
questions legally and ethically.  I think the packet also will aid in my 
organization and will keep the interview moving at an efficient pace.

Thanks,

Errol McLaughlin

John Griffith is asking that we implement in TAGG/ERMS the Asian options that 
are now valued in a Excel spreadsheet
- these are the Asian options that are similar to Gas Daily options.

Could you please send me the Excel or place it in the dropbox.

After having conducted our first of several business reviews, Enron Global 
Markets - Office of the Chairman would like to outline the following 
organizational changes effective immediately.

The Global Risk Markets group under Jere Overdyke illustrates enormous 
opportunities given the size of those businesses.  To better focus on the 
different commercial functions and to capture market share and value, the 
group is being realigned.  Jere will continue to manage Global Risk Markets 
and build on our insurance capabilities.  Mark Tawney is responsible for our 
weather business and will now report to the EGM Office of the Chairman.  

Brent Price will be joining Enron Global Markets as Vice President of 
Operations and Chief Accounting Officer.  He will report to the EGM Office of 
the Chairman, and to Sally Beck, Vice President of Global Risk Management 
Operations.  In his role as Chief Accounting Officer, Brent will also report 
to Rick Causey, Executive Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer for 
Enron Corp.  Reporting to Brent in his new position will be Sheila Glover, 
business controller for Financial Products; Todd Hall, business controller 
for weather; and Scott Earnest, business controller for global products and 
coal.  In addition, Tom Myers will join Brent's management team as Director 
of Accounting.  Brent and his team are responsible for all accounting, risk 
reporting and trading operations for all the businesses within EGM. 

Cindy Skinner will join the Enron Global Markets team with responsibility for 
Human Resources.  She will also report to David Oxley and the HR organization.
 
Please join us in congratulating everyone in their assignments.

Errol,
I noticed a small mistake late last night.  Their is West orig on your Orig 
schedule that is not 0.  It is already on the west schedule so the value just 
needs to be taken off your orig schedule tab.  

The cells that need to be set = to 0 are p41 and q41

Subject: Windows 2000 Migration for the RM-Finance and Administration 
Business Unit

I wanted to take a few minutes to not only introduce myself, but also to 
inform you that ProjectGEM - the Windows2000 Global Enron Migration - is well 
underway and is now approaching your group to begin the initial steps of 
upgrading to this newer operating system. 
Currently Jeff Gossett is our pilot for this business unit and is testing out 
all applications associated with your business unit.  We expect to migrate 
Finance and Administration Wednesday or Thursday of next week (4/4 - 4/5)
As a former member of T.S.G. (TradeFloor Support Group - EB31/32) - I'm well 
aware of the time constraints and schedules you all must work with. 
Therefore, I would like to start the migration process first with visiting 
with each of you, going thru a 'profile process' that should last no more 
than 10-15min. Profiling can begin as early as today- so here is what I ask 
of you: 
*** Please reply to this e-mail with your current location, the number of 
PC's you have and the number of screens/displays you have attached to each 
PC, as well a date/time that I can stop by. Being that most of you sit in the 
same, general location - I'm hoping this profiling process should take no 
more than a few days. *** 
Feel free to e-mail/call me should you have any questions or any specific 
concerns with this process, as we strive to ensure the migration from WinNT 
to Win2K is a smooth, efficient one.

With that in mind, we are excited to let you know that we are introducing t=

We have just signed an agreement with Dell Computer Corporation to provide=

case you and your family were considering the purchase or upgrade of a home=
=20

ClickAtHome includes the following:

? Basic package: Dell desktop computer with a high-speed processor, floppy=
=20
disk drive, mouse, speakers, monitor, modem, CD-ROM drive and Windows 2000=
=20
software. Employees will have the option to receive a subsidized Internet=
=20
connection, including broadband, where commercially available.
? Participation: This program will be available to active regular full-time=
=20
and regular part-time employees of Enron and its wholly owned subsidiaries;=
=20
however, employees of some Enron companies (Portland General Electric, EOTT=
,=20
Enron Facility Services) may not be able to participate due to legal,=20
accounting, tax, labor or business reasons.  Eligibility includes being=20
employed at the time of implementation. =20
? Timing: U.S. employee sign-up will begin in early 2001, with delivery of=
=20
the equipment and Internet connection to follow shortly thereafter.  Delive=
ry=20
of equipment to participating non-U.S. employees is targeted for late 2001.

Details about this program are still being finalized.  To address some of=

Errol-

Deal Number QW8614.3 was put in manually as a trade with Dynegy Canada. 
However, I looked in Enron Online and it says that the counterparty is Dynegy 
Marketing and Trade. 

Thanks.

	Did you feel that? You just earned 10 iCoins for registering.  Wasn't that 
easy? You can earn more iCoins by playing games at:

	* When I say "HUGE", you know what I mean, right? Some of the prizes are 
actually HUGE. Meaning - you can't lift them. The other  HUGE prizes are HUGE 
in the AMAZING sense of the word HUGE. Does that make sense? I suppose I 
could go back and change HUGE to AMAZING. But that would interrupt my flow. 
But I ask you this: Who would really want to interrupt my flow? 
	Yes, this is fine print. But it's not about anything important.

Hi Errol & Sherry,

We received confirmations for the above referenced
deals from Paribas (they confirm us) and Paribas' confirm
differs from what we show in TAGG.  Paribas' trader, Herve,
says that he spoke with John Arnold after the deal was done 
and changed the price from 8.15 to 8.14 and the index from
Gas Daily to NYMEX.     TAGG still reflects the terms that
EOL has.  

Can one of you please find out if John Arnold agreed to these
changes, and if so, can you make the necessary changes
to TAGG?  

Let me know.
Thanks a lot,
Diane

Jeff,

I wanted to give you an update on George's start date.  He is finishing up a 
project currently, and is looking at February 19th as a start date.  However, 
he feels that there is a strong possibility that he will finish earlty and be 
able to start on Feb. 12th.  I will keep you updated.

Thanks,

Hi, Errol:

I am doing great because I am going to join your group soon.  

I have a project in hand.  It was expected to be finished by mid Feburary and 
my current unit would let me go on Feb. 19.  
I am pushing hard to finish this project by the end of next week.  But I 
cannot guarantee it now.  Later this week I will have a better idea of 
whether I could report to you on Feb. 12.  Do you think this is OK?

I look forward working with you soon!  Have a great day!

Errol and Joey,
Just an FYI - 
The Middle Market - West gas orig group is changing it's name to Gas 
Origination - West.  Now when you enter Orig into the West file the Orig 
Group should be the new name.  
Also, on your Orig Schedule please start showing the West orig as Gas 
Origination - West so that everything will match when it is published to the 
web. 

thanks,
brad

Hey Errol,

I was just wondering if you could please get back to me about those two deals
that I've been trying to get some information on from you.  May Nymex is 
being 
invoiced today, April liquidations are being run either on Monday or Tuesday
next week, and I need to know how I'm supposed to invoice for QX0898 and 
QX0899.

It is very important that this gets figured out as soon as possible as the 
customer
is wanting to settle these deals, and we have nothing to show for it right 
now.

Please let me know what you come up with.

Thanks
Stacey

John:

(1) Regarding OptionGrid, Samer can provide you a version that does not write 
out empty grids to the file by tomorrow.  He will then try to increase the 
max. number of grids from 95 to 320.  And we will write the file to a common 
drive that you can access from Windows, without having to FTP the file from 
the Unix to the NT drive.

I will check with my director (Zhiyong Wei) to see if we can move up the 
timeline for the OptionGrid running on Windows project.

(2) Regarding actual gamma: 

PriceDelta = Today's Mid. Price - Prior Day's Mid. Price

Actual delta     = Prior Day's (Option Library) delta * PriceDelta
Actual gamma = Prior Days' (Option Library) gamma * 0.5 * (PriceDelta * 
PriceDelta)

(3) Regarding the Asian model, the number of calendar days in a year is 
365.25 for the new version using calendar days.
We have to merge the new version into the current production PortCalc that 
has the vol. skew changes.  We should have that in a couple of days. I will 
inform Errol when we are ready for him to start testing.

(4) Dave is looking into changing PortCalc to provide 2 actual Vegas - one 
without skew and one with skew.
>From our preliminary analysis, it would require PortCalc, database and report 
changes to do this.
Would you also require 2 predictive Vegas and also sensitivities (i.e. +/- 1, 
2.5, 5 or 10 % vol.) changes also?

I am pleased to announce that iBuyit Payables has been activated for all 
organizations supported by Houston Accounts Payable.  iBuyit Payables is an 
innovative tool that will enable us to code and approve invoices for goods 
and services online.

Who is impacted?
Beginning today, all coders and approvers of invoices that were previously 
submitted to Houston Accounts Payable for processing and payment, will code 
and approve invoices through iBuyit Payables.  Invoices entered directly into 
SAP, will not be impacted by this process.

Note:  Beginning May 8th, any invoices with coding sheets received by 
Accounts Payable will be entered into iBuyit Payables and electronically 
routed back to the coder. The invoice will then need to be coded and approved 
(again) in iBuyit Payables to generate a payment. 

How do I receive training?
Online system demonstrations and quick reference cards are available on the 
Enron intranet in the Integrated Solutions Center Document Library at <
http://sap.enron.com/sap_doclib/user/file_list.asp?cabinet_id=265>.  
Note:  You must use the Enron standard Microsoft Internet Explorer to view 
these materials.

Who do I call for help?
*  For help using the iBuyit Payables system, contact the ISC Call Center at 
(713) 345-4727.
*  For invoice payment status, contact the Accounts Payable Call Center at 
(713) 853-7127
 or toll free at (866) AP ENRON, or send an e-mail to 
iBuyit.payables@enron.com <mailto:iBuyit.payables@enron.com>.

Questions?
For general information about iBuyit, send an e-mail to <

Jeff,

Can you pass on the message below to all of risk.  For EnronOnline, no trades 
should be "reversed" in TAGG.  Simply kill the deal and we'll take care of 
the documentation.

thanks,
Joe Hunter

Subject: Termination of EnronOnline Trades

Per my discussion with Mark Taylor and our conversation today, attached is 
the form of Termination Agreement that should be used when terminating 
EnronOnline mistake or "oops" trades.  The trades should continue to be 
initially run past the Legal Department to determine whether there are any 
unusual circumstances surrounding the trades, but absent unusual 
circumstances, Legal will then pass the trades on to the Confirmation Desk 
for preparation of the Termination Letter and further handling.  These same 
procedure should apply to physical as well as financial transactions.

Since this is a contract, the agreement will require the initials of a lawyer 
and signature of a VP or above for the relevant company.  The Termination 
Letter should be brought to the appropriate Legal Group for signature.

The current policy with respect to mistake trades is that the trade should be 
terminated.  Reverse trades should not be entered into.

If you have any questions, please call.

Jeff - call me when you get  a minute regarding this.  Torrey is absolutely 
correct - our traders have been instructed not to allow customers out of a 
trade without doing an OTC trade or having legal prepare a termination 
agreement.  Sounds like it is time to send out the policy again!

Sheri

Jeff-

>From a legal perspective, the traders are not supposed to have the authority 
to let out another entity from an EnronOnline trade. If the trade is the 
result of a system malfunction or some other uncontrollable issue, the 
customer can get with the trader and agree to reverse out an existing EOL 
transaction with an OTC trade, but Commercial should not be letting customers 
out of EOL deals simply because their traders "clicked on the wrong product". 
This is the policy that Mark Taylor and Legal have had in place since the 
inception of EOL.

I'll get with Sheri and Jennifer and we will see what Legal has to say, but, 
if Mike Maggi and/or John Arnold have been verbally allowing customers to 
change these Gas Daily trades in the past, it definitely creates a problem 
from the perspective of trying to hold them to the same trades now. The best 
advise I can give right now is to make sure that John and Mike do not 
continue allowing customers out of their trades simply because they "clicked 
on the wrong product". The legal responsibility for "clicking on the right 
product" lies firmly with the customer and whenever Commercial starts 
allowing them out of that responsibility it can create serious legal problems 
when and if one of these trades comes back to bite them. 

Torrey

Subject: Gas Daily deals in dispute

Torrey - 

We have an issue where some of our traders are letting traders out of EOL 
deals b/c they "clicked on the wrong product."  What happens is we end up 
having two deals in our systems,  and the counterparty has no deals in their 
system.  So when settlement goes out they tend to accept the one in their 
favor and reject the one against them.  We always work it out but as you can 
imagine it is a huge headache from everyone's perspective.  Please advise on 
what we can do to put an end to this practice.

Thanks

Frank,

I'm sorry,  but disregard the first message I sent.  The $234MM value I 
alluded to is not the value for the one deal booked with a 1993 deal date.  
This value represents the MTM value for all active deals w/ Sithe.  I'm still 
working to find a deal like your requested.  I'll let you know.

Thanks,

Errol

That's great for Maurice and Demetris!  Maurice will make such a good
dad!

I am doing the U of H Exec MBA program.  I go to school all day Friday
and Saturday every other weekend.  As you can see, this is my weekend
off from class.  The most attractive thing about the program is that
it's only a year long!  So, we started in Jan and graduate in Dec.  This
year has already been intensive though with working full-time and trying
to study, read, and write case studies.  FYI-Enron's VP of Corporate
Finance (Dan Castagnola) is in my class and he is very funny. The class
discussions have been pretty interesting so far and since I am the
youngest person in the class I have learned quite a bit from others.
Almost everything is done in these teams that you stay in all year.  I
know it will be worth it though come December.  I would have liked to
have done UT's program because of the name and recognition but with me
being in Houston already this was most feasible. So, pray for me and I
know everything will be ok.

And yes, you are getting old but I am sure you look as young as you were
in high school 'cause I know I do! (smile)
But no, really, I do! :)

I spoke with Kori Loibl, the book administrator for the NG Price Affiliate 
Books regarding the status of the Affiliate Basis book last night (not 
officialized).  Dutch and I are working with Jeramy Wong in IT support to put 
together a program that will let Dutch and myself know the status of every 
book that should be officialized at the end of each night, so that these 
problems can be fixed before the morning.

The book in question was officialized this morning and has zero (0) value.

Please call me at X5-8274 with any questions,

Errol L. McLaughlin

The approval process initiated in 1998 for all meeting and event expenditures 
in excess of $5,000 has enabled ENA to better assess the business value of 
events, accurately track our activities and save money.  These events include 
customer and employee meetings, and trade shows.  

ENA has made some modifications to the process, which are described in this 
memo.

The $5,000 threshold remains in effect for all customer events.  However, the 
threshold for approval for employee meetings and events has been lowered to 
$2,000, and some additional requirements must be met prior to approval.

Please be sure to follow the procedures described below for all meetings and 
events, so we can continue to successfully manage these events.

1) Prior to making any commitments to customers or vendors, all customer 
events with anticipated costs in excess of $5,000, and all employee events 
with anticipated costs in excess of $2,000 must be reviewed by the ENA Public 
Relations (PR) department and approved by the ENA Office of the Chairman

2) The PR department will handle the site search and hotel contract 
negotiations for all such events.  Once this is completed, the PR department 
will work with you to plan and produce your event in its entirety; or they 
can provide as much or as little assistance as you require. The PR department 
will be responsible for helping you achieve the best value for your program 
and ENA.

3) A completed expenditure request form (see attached) and supporting 
documentation is required for each event.  Employee meetings require a 
detailed agenda as part of the event documentation prior to approval.  Please 
submit the completed expenditure request form and documentation to the PR 
department at EB 3642, or work with PR department employees to complete the 
form.

4) After PR review, the expenditure will be submitted to the ENA Office of 
the Chairman for final approval.

Additionally, the PR department can assist in the procurement of tickets for 
various local sporting events and concerts.

If you have any questions regarding this process, would like assistance 
planning an event, or need tickets for a Houston event, please contact Dorie 
Hitchcock in the PR department at (713) 853-6978.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Jeff -

As we discussed today, the following is the TRV (Trader Report Viewer) 
project status:

?  TRV is targeted to be implemented by May 15th as scheduled.
?  TRV development and security setup has been completed and is ready to be 
presented to the traders. 
?  Hal and I will meet with Phillip and Kam tomorrow to provide the TRV 
system and administrator rights review, and to publish  their region's 
reports.
?  We will then meet with Darron, David, and Errol (to be scheduled for early 
next week) to provide the TRV system and  administrator rights review, and to 
publish their region's reports.
?   At the conclusion of the review, we will determine we will roll out the 
training for the remaining team members within each  region (i.e. Region 
Leads or IT to provide training to the team members).
?  Currently TRV is running in the development environment for the review 
period.  Upon conclusion of the review period, we will  ask for approval and 
UAT signoff from you in order to transition the system into the Production 
environment.

Again, thank you and each of your team members for everyone's help and 
support on this initiative!  Please let me know if you have any questions. 

Shirley McDowell
TRV Project / IT Project Manager

California=01,s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last seve=
ral=20
months.  Unfortunately, this debate has generated more heat than light.  We=
=20
want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.=
 =20
Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation=
=20
and our position on California energy issues.

What happened in California

The source of California=01,s current problem is as straightforward as supp=
ly=20
and demand.  California=01,s economy grew 29 percent since 1998.  This incr=
eased=20
the demand for electricity by 24 percent.  At the same time, regulatory=20
restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state.  So=
=20
demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added.  The resul=
t,=20
predictably, is a shortage.  This summer, peak capacity will be about 10=20
percent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state.

In addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related=
=20
factors that led to the current crisis.  First, the state=01,s regulations=
=20
forced all sales and purchases into the spot market.  The spot market for=
=20
power is extraordinarily volatile.  The way firms behave in a free market=
=20
when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo=
ng=20
term, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.  I=
n=20
California, state regulation prevented this strategy.  This would be the=20
equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th=
e=20
most volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine=20
while the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawat=
t=20
was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price.

Second, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remain=
ed=20
in effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep=20
competition out.  This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa=
le=20
prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the=20
regulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt.

In short, California=01,s problems were caused by regulation, not deregulat=
ion. =20
Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new=
=20
generation from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile=
=20
spot prices.

At the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned=
=20
the state=01,s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, w=
hich,=20
if adopted, would have averted the current crisis.

Enron=01,s Role

Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f=
ix=20
the problem.  Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the=20
politicians and the media.  Here are the facts:

? Other than a small amount of wind power, Enron is not a generator in the=
=20
state of California.  Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the=
=20
same market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a=20
market maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.  We ar=
e=20
interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc=
ts=20
for our customers.
? As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from=
=20
the problems the states=01, utilities, and their customers, now face.  We=
=20
protected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility.

You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply=20
power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on=
=20
the open market.  Early reports mischaracterized this as a =01&turnback=018=
 of our=20
customers to the utilities.  Here are the facts:

? As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California=20
market, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct=
ly=20
from the utilities.  This decision reduced EES=01,s market price risk by=20
allowing EES to access lower utility rates.
? EES did not terminate any customer contracts, and our customers continue =
to=20
receive the financial benefits of their contract prices.
? EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them=
=20
with other energy-related products and services, including assistance in=20
reducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times.

Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its=
=20
crisis; Enron continues to sign up customers in the state; and Enron=20
continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western=
=20
power markets.  Enron=01,s primary business is managing risk for our custom=
ers=20
with solutions customized to meet their needs.  There has never been more=
=20
demand for our products and services.

The Solution

The solution to California=01,s crisis is also straightforward.  In summary=
, the=20
state must increase supply, reduce demand, reduce reliance on the spot mark=
et=20
and shore up the financial stability of the state=01,s utilities.

Increasing Supply

California=01,s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing=
=20
short of Byzantine.  Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les=
s=20
than a year.  In California, it often takes 5 to 7 years.  California simpl=
y=20
must streamline this process.  Ironically, while many of the regulations=20
generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality, the=
=20
regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and=20
displacing current plants, which emit 40 times as much NOx.  California can=
=20
have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new=20
facilities.

Reducing Demand

Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand. =
=20
They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is.  An open retail=
=20
market would trigger demand responses, which would balance supply and deman=
d=20
at lower prices than today.  California should fully open its retail market=
.

Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market

In a truly deregulated market, customers would protect themselves from=20
volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer=
=20
term, fixed-price basis.  The state has instead left procurement in the han=
ds=20
of the utilities, which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market=
. =20
Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the=
ir=20
price risk.

Restoring the Financial Integrity of the State=01,s Institutions

The utilities in California are not paying their bills.  This has led to=20
greater uncertainty in the market, higher costs, and reduced flexibility to=
=20
arrive at lasting solutions.  California must permit its utilities to recov=
er=20
their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and=
=20
distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is=
=20
needed.

Just as important as doing these things, the state must avoid policies that=
,=20
while politically attractive, do not fix the problem or even make matters=
=20
worse.  Price caps have been proposed.  They don=01,t work; have never work=
ed;=20
and they will not work here.  Price caps succeed only in creating shortages=
,=20
which then have to be allocated among competing users.  Imagine how=20
ineffectively the government would be in determining, for example, whether =
it=20
is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall=
ey=20
or Silicon Valley.  Price caps are a surefire way to make the current=20
shortage worse.

The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in=20
California.  There is no reason to believe, and every reason to doubt, that=
=20
the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in,=20
constructing, operating and maintaining assets.  This will also result in=
=20
California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power=20
generation -- which the private sector can do -- instead of education, road=
s=20
and other public goods -- which the private sector cannot do.

As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t=
he=20
crisis from the media, it=01,s important for you to know this:  We at Enron=
 will=20
continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real=20
solutions to the state.

The T3 new disk storage technology and new database server for TAGG/ERMS 
database were successfully implemented last weekend. No problems have been 
reported. Nagesh and Ramesh reported performance improvement of CPR and 
RisktRAC. Although users have not noticed significant improvement of the 
system, we believe that performance gain will be seen when system load is 
high and that the new disk storage technology will provide us with better 
fall-tolerance and better performance in the long run.

I want to thank everyone involved in the implementation for the good work. 
Special thanks go to Michael Barber for his sacrifice of first two days of 
his vacation to configure the new server and disk and for his excellent work 
during the implementation. Many thanks also go to the DBAs, Alex Hsieh, Brian 
Ngo, Soo-Lian Ervin and Mable Tang for their diligent work in making database 
migration and performance measurement and in making sure of a smooth database 
migration. I want to specifically thank Nagesh Kavi for his great efforts of 
coordinating all system testing among development groups. I also want to 
thank Malcolm Wells, Wilford Stevens, Terry Sanvido, Dave Commensen and Jay 
Krish for their active support during the implementation. Many thanks also go 
to the Ganapathy Ramesh, Jeremy Wong, Ed Calderon, Dave Wei, Senthil 
Mayilsamy, Narasim Kasaru, Nayan Dattani, Ron Nolte and Mike Swain for their 
hardworking in testing all applications of related systems. Special thanks 
also go to Unify team for having made the implementation by the end of year 
2000 possible by swapping the server and the new T3 disks with TAGG/ERMS and 
for their cooperation during the implementation. Last but not least, I want 
to thank Jeff Gossett, Kam Keiser, Errol Mclaughli, Michelle Bruce, Shifali 
Sharma, John Swinney and Stacey White for their efforts of performing user 
acceptance testing on the New Year Eve day.

Thanks

Given the growth in EES it has become apparent that it is time to consolidate 
the risk functions between EES and EWS.  This will provide EES with the 
systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups 
necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market 
opportunities.

With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk 
groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing, 
structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and 
back-office services.  These groups main function is to provide these 
services to EES.  We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice 
President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the 
Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will 
continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice 
President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the 
Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim 
Belden.

These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while 
ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading 
organizations.

These changes are effective immediately.  Please congratulate Rogers and Don 
on their new roles.

In English this means that even if a book has no positions or value,  if it 
has any deals with a counterparty it needs to be officialized so that credit 
can calculate margin.

Subject: How do officialized books make it to credit?

In the past few months much focus has been put on understanding VAR and how 
it is calculated (through RisktRAC).  However, everyone should note that the 
credit department also receives our information.  Market risk and credit risk 
are inherently different, with different requirements.  This memo serves as a 
reminder of what some of the key differences are, how the credit system uses 
RisktRAC differently from market risk, how this affects us, what some key 
problems are in the credit system caused by our data, and changes to be made 
by risk management groups.

differences are between credit and market risk - you all know this, but many 
of your ba's don't. 
when a book is flat it still has an effect on credit.  Flat books must be 
officialized
market risk is keyed off positions and curves.  When we make money, market 
risk is reduced.  Credit risk is keyed off positions with customers.  When we 
make money, credit risk is increased, as people owe us more money.

how the credit system uses RisktRAC differently from market risk
Market risk picks up all officialized books.  If a book is not officialized 
it does not pick the book up.
Credit picks up all officalized books.  If a book is not officialized, it 
picks up the previous day's position.  Therefore, if positions in book A are 
moved to book B, and A is no longer officialized, credit picks up the 
previous day's position for book A.  As a result, if a book is no longer 
used, please officialize it the first day it is no longer used, so credit 
will pick up 0 on a go forward basis.
Market risk is not concerned with counterparty codes and names.
Credit needs correct counterparty codes and names.  In recent months, the 
counterparty information has deteriorated.  Enron official counterparty names 
need to be used so they flow properly to credit.

what are some key problems in the credit system caused by our data
As referenced above: correct counterparty names and books with 0 positions 
not being officialized so credit picks up previous day info.
As a takeaway from this message please ensure only correct counterparty names 
are used and that if a book has 0 positions that it is officialized the first 
day it has 0 positions.

If you have specific questions about credit, please call Debbie Brackett, at 
X35856.

Harassment Avoidance FAQ

What do I do if I've already taken the class?
If you've already attended a session in the past while employed with Enron, 
you do not have to attend these sessions.  A "Refresher Course" will be 
offered at no cost.  

How do those of us attend the Harassment Avoidance if I do not work in 
Houston?
We are making the Harassment Avoidance sessions available on Video to be 
forwarded to your HR manager.   You are NOT encouraged to make travel 
arrangements to attend the Houston sessions.

Who pays the $50?
The $50 fee will be billed to your cost center. Individuals are not expected 
to pay.

Are there any additional dates than those listed on previous email?
Due to the number of people who have not attended in the past, we are making 
special arrangements to offer more classes in the next few months. 

It is important to note, that unless you've recieved a confirmation, you are 
not enrolled.  

All remaining questions or concerns need to be directed to David Foster 
(x.54360) or by email (david.foster@enron.com).

I am sending the physical trader matrix for another update from risk.  I have 
added a column called 'Sitara Risk Assignment Desk' and populated the cells 
in yellow with what Sitara uses now when assigning hedges.  

Please update the list with the Sitara Risk Assignment Desk and also review 
the cells I populated to ensure accuracy.  

Thank you for all of your help.  Let me know if you have any further 
questions.

Rick Causey recently announced a new online purchase and payment tool called 
iBuyit.  One of the special iBuyit components is an automated accounts 
payable feature that will improve the way you code and approve invoices. 

As of May 1, you will be able to access iBuyit Payables and
? choose budget codes from simple drop down menus
? receive e-mail when you have an invoice that needs to be coded and/or 
approved; and
? view an electronic image of the actual invoice

These improvements will help you assign codes more accurately and will reduce 
the time you spend processing invoices for payment.  The AP tool will also 
begin to eliminate the need for coding sheets or other paper information 
currently in use.  

This tool will provide us the opportunity to transition our Houston-based AP 
processing functions to a third party, SourceNet Solutions.  This transition 
is expected to be completed by August 2001.

You will hear more about the iBuyit initiative, features of the AP tool and 
training opportunities in the coming weeks.  Please contact your AP 
representative if you have any questions.

I paid extra for the 2 Business Day delivery from UPS.  Per the tracking info 
on their website they have not tried to deliver to my house yet and it has 
been three business days.  Do I receive some sort of refund or credit?

Agustin,

Per our discussion on Friday, I have changed this deal so that Enron is 
selling leg 1.  I can't remember.  Did you say that we have already received 
a check back from the counterparty?  Let me know, b/c this deal has price and 
basis and I'm sure the desk that had the basis risk wants the money owed them.

Thanks,

Hey Errol,

I was just wondering if you have any information on these deals yet.  I spoke 
to you 
a few weeks ago about them, and you said that you'd get back to me.  We need 
to
have these deals invoiced and cleared up in TAGG before April Liquidations 
are 
run at the end of the month.  Could you please get back to me and let me know
what you know about them.

Thanks for your help
Stacey

Hi Errol & Sherry,

We received confirmations for the above referenced
deals from Paribas (they confirm us) and Paribas' confirm
differs from what we show in TAGG.  Paribas' trader, Herve,
says that he spoke with John Arnold after the deal was done 
and changed the price from 8.15 to 8.14 and the index from
Gas Daily to NYMEX.     TAGG still reflects the terms that
EOL has.  

Can one of you please find out if John Arnold agreed to these
changes, and if so, can you make the necessary changes
to TAGG?  

Let me know.
Thanks a lot,
Diane

Subject: daily reporting to Rick Buy

Rick Buy has requested that he receive the log of the book officialization 
errors on a daily basis.  Previously, he was only receiving it weekly.  
Because of this change, it will be necessary for risk contols to have a 
complete explanation from your risk groups as to why errors happened.  

The current process is as follows for Houston (using Houston time):
Books officialized in evening by risk management
7:30 am risk controls receives error listing (books which did not make it to 
RisktRAC)
7:30 - 8:30 explanations obtained for error received from risk management 
(Not all explanations are obtained by 8:30)
8:30 meeting to discuss previous night's officialization process and general 
processes
9:00 close obtain explanations not obtained before meeting
Wed pm - weekly consolidated report sent to business controllers and RAC

The process needs to change so that we receive all explanations before the 
8:30 meeting.  I know that many groups identify errors the night before via 
the benchmark or reviews of RisktRAC.  Hopefully, all groups are moving in 
this direction.  Since the log will go out each day, each of you need to look 
at the current process you have in place and determine how you can get us the 
information prior to the 8:30 meeting.

We are trying to put the following process in place (for Houston):
Books officialized in evening by risk management including risk management 
ensuring RisktRAC has all required information, errors noted and an e-mail 
sent to risk controls
7:30 am risk controls receives error listing (books which did not make it to 
RisktRAC)
7:30 - 8:30 explanations obtained for error received from risk management (if 
not received the night before) and log updated
8:30 meeting to discuss previous night's officialization process and general 
processes
Log sent to bus. controllers, RAC - daily

Note:  I know that London, Sydney, and Japan have different processes.  We 
have to work with your current processes to ensure that risk controls 
receives info on time.

It does more harm than good to just do the one leg.  We are currently 
settling all of these deals incorrectly b/c they are pointing to the Houston 
office instead of Calgary.  Please let me know if there is anything that I 
can do to make sure this happens more quickly.

Thanks

Subject: Re: Counterparties w/ Master Agreements with ECC  


  I can make the list of counterparties used by the bridge database driven, 
and have it maintainable via the Tagg maintenance program. Currently, the 
bridge only does the first part of the deal. Flipping out the deal between 
ENA and ECC has to be done manually. Because we're currently making a number 
of changes to the bridge already, and I have other commitments, I'm loathe to 
tackle automating the second leg until sometime after January.

Subject: Counterparties w/ Master Agreements with ECC

I have received an updated list of the counterparties that have Master 
Agreements with ECC.  There are now about 40 counterparties that fall under 
this category.  What seems to be happening is that these counterparties are 
hitting on US gas products on EOL and are not bridging into Tagg correctly.  
Currently, they are bridging as one leg between ENA and the counterparty.  
The problem arises during settlement because ENA cannot settle with these 
counterparties, only ECC can.  An example of what Risk is doing to the 
products after bridging is Tagg#Q79131 / EOL #555401.

RISK:  We need risk to verify that anytime, without exception, all companies 
with Master Agreements with ECC that hit a US product must be booked as two 
legs:  leg one booked between ECC and the counterparty with risk assignment 
of FT-US/CAND-ERMS; leg two flipping the risk out of FT-US/CAND-ERMS to the 
appropriate risk book.  Also, risk needs to verify that this is only for 
Financial Swaps and not Physical deals.  

IT:  It is my understanding that a few counterparties are set up to be booked 
correctly (with two legs).  The list is now up to 40 counterparties and will 
most likely be updated on a consistent basis.  Is this something that Tagg 
Maintenance can handle?  Guidelines need to be set up for Risk/Global to 
instruct IT when new Master Agreements are created with counterparties so 
logic can be adjusted accordingly.

Does a meeting need to be set up to elaborate on these issues?  Are there any 
further issues that need to be addressed concerning ECC Master Agreements?    
(i.e. What about when a counterparty with ECC Master Agreement hits a 
Canadian product out of the Houston office?)  
Please respond with your thoughts on this subject.

Thank you,
Dawn

Susan,

The NG-PRICE-PRC book will now be calculated using two post ids.  Therefore, 
we need an additional RisktRAC book id for the Price book so that we can 
capture both post ids.  Please set up an NG-PRICE2-PRC book with the same 
attributes as the NG-PRICE-PRC book.  The new books needs to be added to the 
AGG-GAS, AGG-GASIII and AGG-GASIV portfolios.  In AGGIII and IV, please set 
up a separate portfolio for the new book.  The new portfolio should be named 
M_Maggi.  

If you have any questions, give me a call.
Thanks,
Robin

Tagg is currently working on a situation where the bridge is creating 
duplicate deals.  This started yesterday and we contacted the appropriate 
books to kill the duplicate deal.  Yesterday, there were a total of eight 
deals duplicating, so far today there are six.  They have narrowed down the 
problem and Mike Swaim and Oscar Rivera think it should be resolved this 
afternoon.  

Meanwhile, Oscar is running a query that will let us know the duplicate 
deals.  He will run this throughout the day and I will e-mail you the deals.  
Listed below in Bold is the duplicate deals from today (two are from late 
last night).  I have placed the risk book next to the deals.  Please forward 
this to the appropriate people in your group.  I was not sure who runs the 
Singapore book, if London could let me know I would appreciate it.

I will keep you updated on the progress.  Sorry for any inconvenience this 
may be causing.  Feel free to call me if you would like more information.

Thanks,
Dawn

Subject: requests for new curves, new books, porfolio changes

In the past few months, the procedures for setting up new curves and books 
have not been followed by everyone. 

The following memo documents the procedures to 1) set up a new curve, 2) set 
up a new book, and 3) change a portfolio hierarchy.  Please note that risk 
management (for each commodity group), "risk management"  is responsible for 
ensuring that information is flowing appropriately between the valuation 
systems and RisktRAC (Risk Analysis and Reporting can help, but do not have 
all of the ERMS information to be able to ensure the completeness of 
RisktRAC).

I have attached the request form for each of these changes at the bottom of 
this memo.  Please ensure that everyone in your group obtains a copy. 

The procedure to set up a new curve is as follows:

Trader starts trading at a new location or a new commodity and needs a new 
curve set up
Trader communicates this to risk management
Risk management constructs new curve in ERMS (with the help of the IT 
department)
Risk management completes a curve set up request form to set up curve in 
RisktRAC
Curve form is forwarded to Risk Analysis and Reporting
Risk Analysis and Reporting sets up curve in RisktRAC
A system generated message is sent to people on the "curve list" indicating a 
change in the RisktRAC curves has been made

If the curve is not set up in RisktRAC the positions are not captured in the 
VAR or engine, thereby making VAR inaccurate.  As a side note, Risk Analysis 
and Reporting has implemented a new process in which on a weekly basis new 
curves set up in ERMS are reviewed to ensure that these have been set up in 
RisktRAC.  We did this for the first time today and noted numerous curves in 
ERMS that are not in RisktRAC - which we are working with you to resolve.

The procedure to set up a new book in RisktRAC is as follows:

Trader/risk management determines new book is needed
New book request form (for RisktRAC) is completed by risk management
New book request form is forwarded to Risk Analysis and Reporting
Risk Analysis and Reporting sets up book in RisktRAC
Risk Analysis and Reporting forwards request to ERMS administrator and global 
counterparty group to request that book is set up in valuation and 
counterparty systems
Once all groups have completed their individual set ups, a final e-mail is 
sent to personnel on the "books list" and the book administrator in the risk 
management department who requested the book

It is important that there is a one to one link between the ERMS and RisktRAC 
books, or not all positions will be captured in RisktRAC (two commodities per 
ERMS book does not flow properly into RisktRAC).

The above two processes have formally existed for a number of months.  
Additionally, we are formalizing the procedure for changing portfolio 
hierarchies.  The procedure now is:

Risk management is responsible for requesting all portfolio hierarchy 
changes.  Previously, changes could be made through a request by Risk 
Analysis and Reporting or RAC.  These two groups are no longer allowed to 
submit change requests.  All requests must come through risk management.
Risk management completes a request, including the reason for the requested 
change in structure
Risk management forwards the request to Risk Analysis and Reporting
Risk Analysis and Reporting makes the change and notifies risk management 
that the change has been made.

If you have any questions, comments or concerns, please call: me X39123, 
Chris Abel X33012, Burton McIntyre X57197, or Susan Trevino X31462.

Thanks,

Shona

Subject: Hedges not linking to sitara deals

Dat and George, risk informed me of 2 additional sitara deals that are not 
"linking" the hedges to the primary sitara deal.  Dat, can you please look 
into this and let me know if this is a quick fix or not.  Risk is inquiring.  
EOL #719279 and #713548 are the one's on question.

Tara and Torrey, what is happening is risk is not seeing a hedge attaching to 
the sitara deal and manually booking the hedge.  But, the hedge is being 
created, just not linked to the primary physical deal.  

Jeff,  I will let you know when this is corrected.  Please advise your group 
not to manually hedge the deals in sitara.  If in doubt if it is hedged, have 
them type in the next number after the sitara number which should be the 
hedge.  For example, the physical deal is 547092, the hedge will be 547093.  
Let me know if you have any further questions.

Thanks,
Dawn

Hi,

I am expanding my Risk Management search outside of  the Houston area. Just 
wanted to know if we found the perfect candidate would you be willing to pay 
relocation and interviewing expenses?  Your feedback is appreciated.  

Thanks!

I would like to announce the following management changes within the Analyst 
/ Associate Program, which are effective immediately.

Traci Warner will assume responsibility for Recruiting for the Western 
Hemisphere.  Traci joined Enron's Associate Program in 1995 and has held 
positions in Business Development, Origination, and Public Relations at Enron 
Energy Services, Enron North America and Enron Broadband Services.

Ted Bland will assume responsibility for Career Development (including 
rotations) for the Western Hemisphere.  Ted has been with Enron since 1989 
and has held several roles in Origination and Business Development within 
Enron Wholesale Services.  Most recently, Ted was assigned to the 
commercialization of some activities within Human Resources.

Anna Jansson, who is based in London, will continue to lead all efforts for 
the Associate / Analyst Program in the Eastern Hemisphere.  Anna has been 
with Enron Europe for the past three years and, most recently, has been 
responsible for setting up the EBS Human Resources function in Europe.

Please join me in working with Traci, Ted and Anna to ensure the success of 
this important program.

Billy Lemmons
Vice President, Analyst / Associate Program

When we meet,  I would like to address the following issues:

1.)  I had at least 5 people here past midnight on both nights and I have 
several people who have not left before 10:30 this week. 
2.)  It is my understanding that Susan was still booking new day deals on 
Thursday night at 8:30 b/c she did not get deal tickets from the trading 
floor until after 5:00 p.m.
3.)  It is also my understanding that Susan is done with the p&l and 
benchmark part of her book often times by 6:00,  but that what keeps her here 
late is usually running numerous extra models and spreadsheets.  (One 
suggestion might be a permanent IT person on this book.)  (This was also my 
understanding from Kyle Etter,  who has left the company.)

I would like to get this resolved as soon as possible so that Larry can get 
the information that he needs to be effective and so that we can run books 
like this and not lose good people.

Thanks

As you might be aware,  Susan Scott (the book admin for the pipe option book) 
was forced by system problems to stay all night Wednesday night and until 200 
am Friday  in order to calc my book.  While she is scheduled to rotate to the 
West desk soon,  I think we need to discuss putting two persons on my book in 
order to bring the work load to a sustainable level.  I'd like to meet at 
2:30 pm on Monday to discuss this issue.  Please let me know if this time 
fits in your schedules.

Thanks,

Larry

Hey!  I hope you are having a good day.  I hate that I missed you last 
night.  We had a good time at the game.  The seats we had were on the floor 
behind the basket on the visiting team's side of the court.  We were all 
drinking and acting a fool so the cameraman put us up on the big screen.  A 
few of us went out after the game, so I am pretty tired today.  Being the 
alcoholic that I am, you know I couldn't just have one drink (ha ha).  

I didn't want anything special.  I just wanted to catch you before you left  
Be careful, and I'll talk to you tonite.

See you soon,

E.L.M.

Here is the information we looked at on Thursday .  It is updated for our 
current position.  Through looking at this you will see that our risk is to a 
significant up move in prices.  Currently, prices are not moving up 
significantly.

Thanks,

Hey,
I have been sooooo swamped with school and work this week!  Hope your
week has been lots better than mine.  It looks like you have a great job
doing exactly what you've always wanted to do.
Well, Jana is 11 yrs old now so you should feel pretty old 'cause you
are. :)  And she acts like a little lady too.  I know your cousin Lauren
must been close to college by now.  I don't even want to know how old
her brother is.  Wow, how time passes...
Jina is at UH about to graduate this May.  Don't ask me what she is
going to do with a sociology degree but she likes helping people and
working with them.  My parents are doing fine.  My dad is living in
Baton Rouge now.  How are your parents?  Has your father retired yet?
I also wanted to ask you about your boy, Maurice.  I heard he got
married to Demetris and I was kinda hurt he didn't invite me to the
wedding, but C'est la vie.  Tell him I said hello and give me his e-mail
address if you have it.
Well, I just wanted to see how you were doing.  You know, make sure you
were still alive and well. :)

Hey Johnelle,

It's great to here from you again.  Yeah, I'm over at Enron now.  I
manage
the group responsible for all of the natural gas financial trading risk
management.  I've been here for a little over a year now.  It's a great
job
and company, but the hours are unbelievable!!!  The family's good.  How
are
Janna, Gina, (sp) and your mom.  I'm afraid to ask --- how old is Janna
now?  When you tell me, I'm going to feel really old!!  Tell everyone I
said, 'Hi'.  The NYMEX was only open for half the day, so I'm taking
advantage.  Call me when you get a minute!!

John,

Could you do me a big favor.  Sherry has been really working hard and doing a 
good job.  Do you think that you could talk with one of your contacts and get 
her a pair of Rockets tickets.  I know they are a playing the Clippers 
tommorrow night.   I know that no one else wants to see the Clippers, but 
she's never been to a game and would really appreciate it.

Thanks,

Errol, X5-8274

So You Want to Make Your Own Cigars
Doug Doan was obsessed with making a cigar rarer than a Fuente Fuente OpusX, 
so he dug up his backyard, grabbed a can of Ortho and planted his own 
personal tobacco crop.

Sharon,

I have the confirmations on my desk for the deals that you requested, with 
the exception of two deals.  Deal N60753.4 and N60753.6 were booked to change 
an existing deal (N60753.3) from a financial swap to a physical forward.  We 
will have the paperwork on those two deals after lunch -- we're getting them 
from the Structuring group.

The NG price curve, outside of the first 36 months, is set based on market 
quotes and daily activity, as well as trend calculations and differentials.

I will let you know as soon as I have the confirms for the other two deal.

Thanks,

Errol McLaughlin

Cecillia,

When we choose FIMAT as a broker in Exchange Capture, we can not save a deal 
because the account number section is blank.  Could you please fix this as 
soon as possible.  Please call me with any questions at X5-8274.

As a result of restructuring out-of-the-money transactions with BP Capital 
and T. Boon Pickens, we have a total of $9,530,935 in the Schedule C for the 
NG Price book.  These values are negative in Schedule C, thus they are 
positive value to the book.

A total of $9,321,151 will be released out of Schedule C tonite (8/29/2000).  
The remaining $209,784 will be relesed by the end of the week.  We are 
awaiting word on whether or not this value will be needed for credit reserve.

Thanks,

Errol McLaughlin, X5-8274

Durch,

It looks like the unwind was booked incorrectly. Instead of deal QF9221.1 
netting out the original deal, it was adding to it.  I have killed deal 
NN6788.1 for 5000/day, so that all that is left is the deal for 2500/day.

Errol

Errol,

Check this in the system and see if he is being billed for the original deal 
and an unwind deal to net him to the correct position.
Let me know or contact Perry please.

John - Could you please alert your back office that they are still invoicing
us on a Nov-Mar strip that was traded on June 20, 2000 at $4.105.  That deal
was cancelled per our discussion and rebooked for half the volume in
November (I beleive it was November).  Your deal number on the rebook is
QF9221.1 I beleive.  I beleive Dutch Quigley on your end was involved when
we originally discussed the deal.

Thanks and call if you have any questions.

Subject: Gas Daily deals in dispute

The following deals are being disputed by Reliant Energy Services. TAGG is 
showing these deals as Gas Daily, but the counterparty states that they 
should be changed to Nymex trades. They also stated that they were told by 
Mike Maggi that the deals would be changed to Nymex deals:

User has NT group added to memberships and also setup like sscott5. 
Have him use his Unix ID and password if he doesn't know it have him call the 
helpdesk at 3-1411 to reset it after the reset it takes 30 minutes for it to 
replicate so he would have to wait

Jeff,

Derek stopped by after he talked to his wife over the phone and it looks like 
he will probably take the job.  He wants to talk to her again tonite, and he 
will let me know officially tommorrow.  So he can let Joe Hunter know -- any 
idea on when they'll want him to start?

Thanks,

Subject: NCAA tournament

I am getting a tournament bracket together for the group. Here are the 
important details - $10 per entry, bonus points per upset predicted are the 
differential between the seeds(i.e. 12 beats a five you get 1 pt for the 
victory and seven points for the upset), first round games worth 1 pt., and 
the points for each subsequent round are the round plus 1 pt. (championship 
game worth 7 pts., sixth round plus 1 pt.), tie breaker is total points 
scored in final game.  Brackets are due on my desk or in my email box by 8 
a.m. CST Thursday March 15th.  Here is a link to a bracket.  Please forward 
to anyone you think may be interested.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

East Power Group
The East Power Group is off to another strong start in 2001.  The realignme=
nt=20
of the group into regional business units with joint trading, mid-marketing=
,=20
and origination operations has proven to be a catalyst for deal flow,=20
producing both a high volume of transactions and high value.  More=20
transactions were executed in January than any month last year, including o=
ne=20
deal that will bring tremendous strategic value to Enron as well.

Executed in January, was the purchase of two 35 MW coal-fired cogeneration=
=20
facilities located in southeastern North Carolina.  ENA will supply steam t=
o=20
the industrial host, Alamac Knit Fabrics, and will sell power into the=20
merchant market.  The plants are inside Carolina Power & Light's service=20
territory, which is connected to AEP, Virginia Power, Duke, SCEG and SCPSA.=
 =20
These plants are the first purely merchant facilities in North Carolina. =
=20
This deal exemplifies how Enron leverages its talent in that originators fr=
om=20
the East Power Group and Industrial Markets Group joined forces to bring th=
is=20
deal to execution.  They also leveraged the Global Markets group to manage=
=20
the coal supply and emissions issues.

Prospects going forward look promising as a number of high value transactio=
ns=20
are in the pipeline.  Of particular note is The Sandhill Power Project, a 1=
80=20
MW peaking facility currently under construction in Austin.  The facility i=
s=20
scheduled to come online in June, in time for the advent of deregulation in=
=20
Texas. The joint venture, between EPMI and Austin Energy, will provide both=
=20
trading groups with a highly flexible asset, enabling them to access=20
real-time volatility while hedging existing obligations.

Additionally, the Fort Pierce (Florida) City Council voted 5 to 0 in favor =
of=20
Enron's proposal to repower the Ft. Pierce Utilities Authority's (FPUA)=20
existing power plant in that city.  Our proposed 180 MW facility will be us=
ed=20
to produce steam to power the H.D. King facility at approximately 20 percen=
t=20
less cost than FPUA can produce it.  According to FPUA officials, this=20
reduction in cost may lead to reduced rates for their ratepayers.  The=20
planned in-service date is summer of 2002.

Industrial Markets
EIM Fundamental Analysis Group grows again!  The Fundamental Analysis Group=
=20
continues to expand its staff and capabilities.  They will be introducing y=
ou=20
to specific activities in the weeks to come, but would like to introduce yo=
u=20
to the new staff members who have joined in the past month. =20

On the paper/pulp/lumber side, Bin Wang is responsible for supporting the=
=20
lumber group; Adnan Patel will be assisting with newsprint and structured=
=20
transactions. =20

For the steel group, Doug Parsons and Yana Kristal are providing market=20
analysis and econometric/price forecasting support.  Our latest recruit,=20
David Maxwell, is assisting with the evaluation of a customer management=20
system and developing analytical databases for all product lines. A visible=
=20
enhancement to the group=01,s operations has been the Intranet web site, wh=
ich=20
has been in development for the past three months.  The site will be=20
transferred to a production server by the end of February.  The site contai=
ns=20
all types of industry, market, regulatory, analytical, and financial=20
information for deal analysis. =20

Another major development is the adoption of a customer information=20
management system.  EIM is currently evaluating Siebel Systems, a software=
=20
provider that has developed this type of information tool for EES.


IN THE NEWS

Enron has been named the "Most Innovative Company in America" for the sixth=
=20

Bill:

The TDS flag and Rolloff % fields in PortCalc are now in production MetaCalc.

Please note that when copying a meta_id, these fields are copied as is, which
is similar to PortCalc's copy post_id behaviour.

Thank you,

In addition to Gas, Coal will start using TDS next week.

Deutsche Bank has gotten back to me and is vacillating on what they want to 
do with the Bankers Trust trades.  In particular, they haven't thought 
through what they want to do with the online trades, don't like on online 
documentation, and now they think they may want to do a full novation of the 
trades once they decide how to resolve this.  So, until we hear back from 
them (they said in about a week), just let the Bankers Trust financial trades 
and master sit.

We regret to announce that with the reduced emphasis on developing large 
infrastructure projects in certain countries, a number of individuals have 
elected to leave Enron.  Diomedes Christodoulou, formerly Chief Commercial 
Officer of Enron Broadband Services, James Bannantine, formerly CEO of Enron 
South America, and Sanjay Bhatnagar, formerly CEO of Enron Broadband Services 
for the Middle East and Asia, have elected to leave Enron to pursue other 
opportunities.  Diomedes, Jim and Sanjay built and led strong and talented 
teams at Enron.  We wish all of these individuals the very best in their new 
endeavors.

Mark,

Deals NZ9791 and NZ9950 were done between John Arnold (gas floor) and Fletch 
Sturm (power desk).  Deals done between desks inside Enron do not have deal 
tickets, nor do they get confirmed.  The details for these deals were 
included in the information picked up Friday.

I apologize for not relaying this sooner, but all question regarding the 
Management book (P&L, etc.) need to be directed to Georganne Hodges at 
713-853-0430.

Attached below is the forwards detail that you requested for the LTX GD book 
for 12/7/01 and for the NG Price book for 12/19/2001.



I am getting confirms on the deals in the table below and will call you as 
soon as I get them.  Please be advised that these deals are in the forwards 
details that I have already given you.  Also, deals QE6558 & QF4044 will not 
have confirms b/c they are intra-desk deals within Enron.

Dawne,

I looked at the Gas Daily swaps and they look good.  QV0345 booked as a June 
deal instead of May 01.  The NYMEX swap booked with NXB2 as the expiration.  
If I'm not mistaken, the swaps should be NX1.  

Thanks,

Errol

BT is no longer a valid counterparty (according to TAGG when you go into the 
deal).  One can not save a deal w/ an invalid c/p name in the deal.  Jennifer 
Blay is currently trying to get us the correct counterparty name.

Errol-

There are two Bankers Trust Deals that you changed to Bankers Trust 
International. I pulled the trades from EOL and they say Bankers Trust. The 
Deal Nos are QT6916 and QT7116. Were these changed in error?

Thanks. Julie

Errol and Joey,
Just an FYI - 
The Middle Market - West gas orig group is changing it's name to Gas 
Origination - West.  Now when you enter Orig into the West file the Orig 
Group should be the new name.  
Also, on your Orig Schedule please start showing the West orig as Gas 
Origination - West so that everything will match when it is published to the 
web. 

thanks,
brad

We have a new version of the TAGG-Deal Capture Application in TAGG's staging 
area ready for user testing. The reason for the new version is to incorporate 
three new requests. The new requests are as follows:

Provide ability to capture external exchange deal numbers and associate them 
with a TAGG deal.
For TAGG deals that have more than 9 legs,  redo numbering such that leg 
numbers on Deal Structure Screen match  with leg numbers in Deal Capture 
Detail screen and  forwards 
detail report .
For physical NG deals, require  a link to a Sitara deal num before allowing 
deal to save in TAGG.

The attached document contains more information regarding the external 
exchange item mentioned above.


The current plan is to migrate these changes into  production the evening of 
Monday January 22, 2001. If you have any problems with the changes made to 
this version of Deal Capture Application or with 
the proposed migration plans, please contact Oscar Rivera(x5-3361) or Sanjeev 
Gupta (x5-3816) as soon as possible.

thanks,

Oscar Rivera

Subject: Interest-Rate Hedging Guides - REMINDER

Just a reminder....
Please advise the Rate & Currency Trading Desk when large deals are going to 
be booked by 1:30 P.M. (CST).  This allows the desk to hedge the deal for 
interest rates on the same day that the trade is booked in the commodity 
books.  This eliminates Enron's exposure to markets on the following day for 
these large deals.  

If the Rate & Currency Trading Desk is not notified of large deals prior to 
1:30 P.M., the desk will hedge the interest-rate exposure the next day on a 
best efforts basis.  On these deals, any resulting profit or loss in excess 
of $20,000 will be passed back to the originating group by the trading desk.

We request that the book adminstrator advise Clara Carrington, 3-9224, and 
the Traders should be advising Pushkar Shahi, 3-9199, or Ellen Su, 3-5256, on 
the Rate & Currency Trading Desk.  Europe should contact Shane Dallman, 
3-4997. in the London office. 

Ellen has put together some guidelines which you can share with your traders 
regarding the sizing for large deals.   This is included below.

Your cooperation is appreciated.
Sheila

Guidelines:
The following is a guide to the profit/loss levels in various tenors that 
would require notification of the interest-rate desk.  

Tenor  Notional Cash Flows
2y  30,000,000
3y  20,000,000
5y  15,000,000
10y  10,000,000
15y  7,000,000
20y  5,000,000

Please remember that these amounts are not cumulative.  Each bucket needs to 
be evaluated alone, and then aggregated.  For example, if you had a -30mm 
notional cash flow in the 2-year bucket and it is offset by a +30mm notional 
cash flow in the 20-year bucket, the result would still be very significant 
as the net long cash flow position would still be around +25mm 20-year cash 
flows.

As always, if you are ever unsure, we are more than happy to look at 
deals/curve changes to determine significance.  Thanks.

Ellen Su

Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total 
car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing 
provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value 
proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first 
choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract 
reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and 
low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, 
where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or 
Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate 
selected: 
1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or 
Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for 
any damage to it. 
2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. 
For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 
per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following 
contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded 
on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)

To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's 
preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in 
National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club 
membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the 
transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid 
return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron 
travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron 
American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on 
the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact Jeff Leath at 
713-646-6165.

Can the following deals be rebooked using the current intercompany 
methodology:

 Buyer = Enron Energy Services
 Seller = Enron North America (or RMT if these are all financial)

Then what is now the counterparties on the deal will become the books. 

These are the only deals that are left that are booked the old way.  I was  
hoping to make things consistent.  Two of the deals (EH1958.1, EH4242.5) will 
roll off the end of May -the others have months to go.

Thanks for the help

Please see the attached spreadsheet of the option outline.  Also, there was 
only one deal that was done today.  The other deals are from yesterday.  The 
deal that was done today is 753351, and it looks fine.  Let me know if you 
have any questions.  Thanks TARA

Shannon,

I am in the process of cleaning up the February folder.  When finished you 
will see two DPR's - NG-Price & NG-PR-OPT.  Mike and John have decided to 
split out the old NG-Price book so that swaps/futures go to John and 
options/exchange options go to Mike.  I will call you as soon as I have it 
done.  Tonight is the first night we are using the new book.  I have not 
heard anything back regarding the January variance since I left you the voice 
mail.

Thanks,

Errol

Errol,

I received a book request for the NG Options Book (Code ZH). Will this be a 
new roll in the NG Price book, associated with the PG book code? Also, I 
noticed that the PG book has three DPR's in the February folder. Should I be 
using the 022001NG DPR or the 022001NGmike and 022001NGjohn? What did you and 
Todd decide to do with the January variance from the NGP&L? Too many 
questions!!

Thanks!

Shannon

Subject: EES Request

Sherry/Errol:

I just got a request from Todd Lambert at EES to retroactively do a trade for 
expired months.  The details are:

EES sold NYMEX gas contracts to a customer named Springs Industry for futures 
months October, November, and December 2000.

However they were not supposed to sell to the customer directly at that 
point.  He wants to know if we can work out a deal where he instead sold 
those contracts to us and then have us sell to the customer.

There would be no net position and we would just serve as a pass through for 
their deal.

I'll come by later today to see if we can do it.

Vikas

Jeff, attached is a file containing gas curves that have been identified as

Benchmark mapping table and/or the Primary/Secondary curve table.  Curves 
missing from RisktRAC could have a significant impact on positions and V@R.  
Please let us know by Thursday, April 26th, if these curves should be added 
to the RisktRAC system.   For those curves that need to be added to RisktRAC, 
a blank curve request form is also attached. Thank you.

compliance certificates last fall, but you should read the policy to enhance 
your understanding, and distribute it to your groups as some changes are 
significant and are detailed further in the policy.  I did notify the Office 
of the Chair for each of your business units of these changes earlier this 
week, and I will also provide them with a copy of the revised policy.  


If you have any questions, feel free to give me a call at x 30429.

Regards,
Cassandra Schultz
Market Risk Management

These annuities were paid to the counterparty after several deals we had with 
them were restructured.  George Gilbert (the originator responsible) has 
already confirmed the deals with the counterparty.

This is great information.  However,  without knowing who entered the deals 
there is little we can do to fix this.  ie.  Is it a trader?  Which book 
admin is it?  Can you get names of the person entering the deals on the 
report?  And do you put every deal that has to be changed on this report?  Or 
just the deals that are in wrong for more than a certain time period?  I 
would caution if you are putting every deal that changes into this report you 
might want to change your practice, as now that the traders have TDS they 
tend to want to see the economic impact ASAP and so everyone including the 
trader is rushing to get the position into the system.  Please let me know if 
there is anything I can do to help.

Errol, thanks for writing.  I discussed this matter with George Huan this 
morning, in person, and he tells me that he rebooked the deals originally 
booked to El Paso Merchant Energy Gas - L.P. to El Paso Merchant Energy L.P. 
correctly in his spreadsheet pretty late last night after you spoke with him 
and so it did not get into our system last night.  He has assured me, 
however, that everything is in order for tonight's run and that the problem 
should be fixed Monday.  I will advise you if the situation is unresolved 
Monday.  Thanks for your follow up.  Sue.

Sue,

I am sending you this e-mail because I received your voice message well after 
you left it today.  I reviewed the text files that are sent out by the book 
administrators on my desks and none of them contain any deals booked to the 
counterparty El Paso Gas Marketing.  All of the deals from people on my desk 
are booked to the valid El Paso counterparty per our conversations.

I will be out of the office tomorrow, but I will be checking my voicemail 
frequently and communicating with my group.  If the same problem arises 
tomorrow, please call me at 713-305-1502 so that we can discuss, because 
there has to be some other explanation for the erroneous counterparty showing 
up on your report.

Thank you,

Errol McLaughlin, X5-8274

As many of you have already noticed, this year Enron will be closing its 
offices on Monday, January 15 in honor of Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.  This 
is the first time we have observed this national holiday, and I am certain 
that many of you will be pleased to know that the executive committee has 
decided that we will continue to do so in the future.

Enron continues to observe 10 holidays each year (including two floater 
holidays) and provides one additional discretionary holiday for our 
employees.   For a complete listing of Enron's holiday schedule, go to

Effective immediately, reporting responsibility for Global Strategic Sourcing 
(GSS) will move from Enron Net Works to Enron Corp.  George Wasaff, Managing 
Director, will report directly to Rick Causey, Executive Vice President and 
Chief Accounting Officer for Enron.  GSS, formed February 1, 2000, will 
continue to focus on supply-chain management world-wide for Enron.   We 
believe this change in reporting will leverage and enhance GSS's global reach 
and effectiveness while allowing ENW to focus on its core mission of creating 
new electronic market places.

We are trying to make sure that everyone that is trading options with us off 
line are aware that we have both GD and Price Options on EOL.  Do you have a

Errol,

Could you please make the following adjustments in your NG Price DPR's, in 
order to correct the NGP&L January problem? In the 012001NG DPR, reduce the 
liquidations in Roll 4 by $2,898,246. This should bring your total hedge 
management number on your report page to $109,744,754, which will make the 
DPR tie to the NGP&L for January. Then, in your February DPR take an income 
adjustment of $2,898,246. You can add this adjustment to the PMA file that I 
sent you last week. If you make these two adjustments, it should get us back 
to where we need to be for the NGP&L tie out. Let me know if you have any 
questions.

Thanks!

Shannon

These are the spreadsheets still using the old method of processing. These 
need to be processed with the new method as early as possible so that I can 
get rid of the older processsing methodology.

Notice # 01-156
May 9, 2001

TO:
All NYMEX Members and Member Firms

FROM:
Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President

RE:
NYMEX Post-Close Trading Session Rules

DATE:
May 8, 2001
===========================================================

This Notice advises Members and Member Firms of changes to the two
post-close session rules applicable to the NYMEX Division.

!    As a result of amendments to both rules, the post-close sessions
generally offered Monday-Thursday will be the same as the Friday sessions
with two exceptions.

!    Monday-Thursday. These sessions will start at 3:25 p.m. and will be
two minutes long.

!    Fridays. These sessions will start at 3:30 p.m. and will be five
minutes long.


End of Week Post-Close Trading Session (Rule 6.57A)

As a reminder and as a follow-up to a Notice distributed last week, please
be advised that beginning on Friday, May 11, 2001, a number of amendments
to NYMEX Rule 6.57A, the NYMEX End of Week post-close trading session rule,
will become effective. The new version of this rule is attached below.

For Friday post-close sessions (and for post-close sessions the day before
a mid-week Exchange holiday) the following changes will be in effect:

(1)  Eligible contract months will be expanded from the first four to the
first 12 consecutive listed contract months.

(2)  The sessions now will be 5 minutes in duration.

(3)  The trading range for these sessions will be expanded by adding the
following ticks above (below) the
daily high (low) for the applicable contract month (provided that this
expanded trading range does not violate the maximum permissible price
fluctuation limits then in effect):

Crude Oil      20 ticks
Heating Oil         50 ticks
Unleaded Gas        50 ticks
Natural Gas         50 ticks


Monday-Thursday Post-Close Trading Sessions (Rule 6.57)

In addition, please be advised that beginning on Monday, May 14, 2001, a
number of amendments to NYMEX Rule 6.57, the Exchange's post-close trading
session rule for days other than Fridays, will become effective.  The new
version of this rule is attached below.

(1)  Eligible contract months will be expanded from the first four to the
first 12 consecutive listed contract months.

(2)  The trading range for these sessions will be expanded by adding the
following ticks above (below) the
daily high (low) for the applicable contract month (provided that this
expanded trading range does not violate the maximum permissible price
fluctuation limits then in effect):

Crude Oil      20 ticks
Heating Oil         50 ticks
Unleaded Gas        50 ticks
Natural Gas         50 ticks

(3)  Customer participation will be expanded to the same extent as is
permitted for the End of Week Post Close Session. Please note that any
order submitted during the RTH session, including but not limited to
resting orders such as stop orders, limit orders and good until cancelled
(GTC) orders, will be deemed to have expired as of the end of RTH for
purposes of this Session.  Accordingly, in the event that a market
participant with such an expired order seeks to participate in the Session,
a new order must be submitted.

(4)  As a consequence of the expanded trading range and customer
participation, trades done during this period will be price reported on
PRS.

Finally, please be advised that, as a matter of practice, the Exchange does
not currently offer post-close trading sessions for Propane futures
contracts.

If you have any questions concerning these changes, please contact George
Henderson, Vice President, NYMEX Floor Department, at (212) 299-2071; Rob
Stasi, Manager of Trading Floor Systems, NYMEX Floor Department, at (212)
299-2067, or Brian Regan, Senior Associate General Counsel, at (212)
299-2207.

NEW VERSIONS OF  NYMEX RULE 6.57("POST-CLOSE TRADING SESSION") AND
NYMEX RULE 6.57A ("END OF WEEK TRADING SESSION")

Rule 6.57.      ("POST-CLOSE TRADING SESSION")

Fifteen (15) minutes after the close of trading in all futures contracts,
or five (5) minutes after the closing range is established for all
applicable contract months other than contract months in the Sour Crude Oil
futures contract, whichever is later, trading shall resume for a period of
two (2) minutes (the ``Session'') in all energy futures contracts, subject
to the following conditions:

(B) Trades occurring during the Session for a particular contract month of
a futures contract shall be executed openly and competitively at a price

expanded trading range may exceed the price fluctuation limits in effect
for the applicable contract as of the end of the RTH session:

Contract                 Additional Ticks

Crude Oil                20 ticks
Natural Gas                   50 ticks

Heating Oil                   50 ticks

may participate in the same manner as trading occurring during the regular
RTH session, except that any order submitted during the RTH session,
including but not limited to resting orders such as stop orders, limit
orders and good until cancelled (GTC) orders, will be deemed to have
expired as of the end of RTH for purposes of this Session.  Accordingly, in
the event that a market participant with such an expired order seeks to

across their trading cards prior to the entry of a Session trade.

Rule 6.57A.     END OF WEEK TRADING SESSION

On the last trading day of the calendar week, and, in any week when an
Exchange holiday falls on a Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday on the trading
day preceding such midweek Exchange holiday, there shall be no post-close
trading session provided on the trading floor pursuant to Rule 6.57.
Instead, on such dates, an end of week trading session (the "End of Week
Session'') shall commence on the trading floor pursuant to this rule and
subsequent to the close.  Except as otherwise provided by the President or
the President's designee for a particular trade date, such End of Week
Session shall commence twenty (20) minutes after the close of trading in
all futures contracts and shall continue for a period of  five (5) minutes
in all energy and metals futures contracts, subject to the following
conditions:

(A) Trading during the End of Week Session shall be limited to the first
twelve listed delivery months;

(B) Trades occurring during the End of Week Session for a particular
contract month of a futures contract shall be executed openly and
competitively at a price within the daily trading range of the applicable
contract month for that futures contract and as further expanded above the
daily high and below the daily low only for the contracts listed below
provided however that no such expanded trading range may exceed the price
fluctuation limits in effect for the applicable contract as of the end of
the RTH session:

Contract                 Additional Ticks

Crude Oil                20 ticks
Natural Gas                   50 ticks
Unleaded Gasoline             50 ticks
Heating Oil                   50 ticks

(C) During the End of Week Session, Floor Members, Floor Brokers and their
customers may participate in the same manner as trading occurring during
the regular RTH session, except that any order submitted during the RTH
session, including but not limited to resting orders such as stop orders,
limit orders and good until cancelled (GTC) orders, will be deemed to have
expired as of the end of RTH for purposes of this End of Week Session.
Accordingly, in the event that a market participant with such an expired
order seeks to participate in the End of Week Session, a new order must be
submitted.

(D) Prices for trades executed during the End of Week Session shall  be
reported on public ticker services;

(E) Current market prices and trades executed during the End of Week
Session shall not be considered in determining any settlement price; and

Hello everyone,

Hope you all are doing well.
I believe the Cross Timbers rebooking nitemare has finally come to an end!
All we need to do now is send out the revised confirms.

Accounting:
Below is a list of deal numbers that were either changed, killed, or created.
I believe this is everything.

Please let me know if I seem to be missing any deals or if you have any 
questions.

Best Regards and THANK YOU to everyone who has contributed to this 'project'!

Kori,

Please make all adjustments that are needed for the Prepay books, in the 
January DPR.  These variances are causing a problem for Faith Killen's flash 
to actual process and Arthur Anderson has been questioning the variance from 
the total value in Schedule B versus the controls group schedule. AA loves to 
dissect the prepay books!

Please let me know if any of you have any questions.

Thanks!

The following deals are being disputed by Reliant Energy Services. TAGG is 
showing these deals as Gas Daily, but the counterparty states that they 
should be changed to Nymex trades. They also stated that they were told by 
Mike Maggi that the deals would be changed to Nymex deals:

Subject: Open Items and Price Curve Explanation

Sharon,

I have the confirmations on my desk for the deals that you requested, with 
the exception of two deals.  Deal N60753.4 and N60753.6 were booked to change 
an existing deal (N60753.3) from a financial swap to a physical forward.  We 
will have the paperwork on those two deals after lunch -- we're getting them 
from the Structuring group.

The NG price curve, outside of the first 36 months, is set based on market 
quotes and daily activity, as well as trend calculations and differentials.

I will let you know as soon as I have the confirms for the other two deal.

Thanks,

Errol McLaughlin

Maurice and Demetrius are doing great, and they just found out that they're 
pregnant!  My dad is still working --- I think they are going to have to drag 
him out kicking and screaming.  Where are you going to school?  How long do 
you have left?  

I'm glad you e-mailed.  It is nice to catch up and see what your doing.

What's up with the 'old' crack!  Baby, I'm just aging like fine wine!!! : )

Errol,

Below is the PVR schedule that is passed on to me by gas accounting. The 
dollar amount of $79,646.37 needs to be passed through the NG Price book as a 
liquidation and an offsetting origination for Charlie Otto. In the past, 
Dutch used to handle this process, so I am sure that he could answer any 
questions that you may have. The line items that are highlighted in blue 
total the $79,646.37 that needs to be passed through the DPR. The other line 
items in the schedule have already been taken.

Thanks!!

Let me know as soon as possible when you can do Sherry's review and the 
others as well, so I can get with Liz to schedule something that works for 
everyone.  They want the regular ones to be done by the end of next week, and 
Sherry's has to be done by Jan 19, 2001.

Thanks -- I know it's a pain,

Errol

Vikas,

Attached are excel files for the different subsidiaries.  Each file has a tab 
for the swap position and the option position.  For the options I have added 
an auto filter at the top of the file so you can sort by strike price.  I 
apologize for the delay, but I was trying to drop the info into an 
appropriate format.



Thanks,

Errol McLaughlin, X5-8274

Please use the shortcut below or go to the following path O:\Energy_Ops\OPM

Since we are beginning a new quarter, we have cleared all FTE's in the hours 
survey so please make sure to complete the FTE's section of the survey this 
month.  You can enter your FTE's using the second button on the main menu of 
the survey.  When completing the FTE's section of the survey, if there are 
any Director (this includes Sr. Directors), Sr. Admin or Admin positions in 
your cost center, please complete accordingly.  You are not expected to 
complete a hours survey for these positions but we do need them to be 
included in your FTE's.

Subject: New Book

Susan,

The NG-PRICE-PRC book will now be calculated using two post ids.  Therefore, 
we need an additional RisktRAC book id for the Price book so that we can 
capture both post ids.  Please set up an NG-PRICE2-PRC book with the same 
attributes as the NG-PRICE-PRC book.  The new books needs to be added to the 
AGG-GAS, AGG-GASIII and AGG-GASIV portfolios.  In AGGIII and IV, please set 
up a separate portfolio for the new book.  The new portfolio should be named 
M_Maggi.  

If you have any questions, give me a call.
Thanks,
Robin

Subject: Officializing Risk Books

Irena - Please forward to all in Risk Management:



In the last few weeks there have been numerous occasions in which certain 
risk books have not been officialized.  Most of these instances have been due 
to oversight; one instance was at the direction of Commercial.

I want to re-emphasise the importance of ensuring that all risk books are 
officialized at the end of the day.  This is the only mechanism we have to 
ensure that all trading positions are included in the Daily Position Report 
and daily trading limit calculations, both of which are reviewed by top Enron 
management on a daily basis.  This must be a top priority for Risk Management 
and we need to do whatever we have to do to make sure we remember to perform 
this function at the end of every day.  Furthermore, it is totally 
unacceptable for Commercial to direct any book administrator to not 
officialize a risk book.  If this occurs again and you are uncomfortable with 
dealing with the situation, please inform your Desk Controller, Steve Jackson 
or myself immediately and we will address the issue.

I realise every one of you has a lot on your plate and are working 
significant hours to get your jobs done.  However, let's do what we have to 
do to make sure that this basic responsibility of Risk Management is 
performed every day without any exceptions.

Brent

Please red the paragragh in red below from an e-mail I sent last month....

I need risk to confirm that all counterparties that have master agreements 
with ECC (now 41 counterparties) need to be booked with 2 legs as described 
below in red.  

We need this confirmation from risk as soon as possible.  We are pushing IT 
to get this logic in place and don't want anything to "blow up" for risk.  
Please respond by e-mail.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Subject: Counterparties w/ Master Agreements with ECC

I have received an updated list of the counterparties that have Master 
Agreements with ECC.  There are now about 40 counterparties that fall under 
this category.  What seems to be happening is that these counterparties are 
hitting on US gas products on EOL and are not bridging into Tagg correctly.  
Currently, they are bridging as one leg between ENA and the counterparty.  
The problem arises during settlement because ENA cannot settle with these 
counterparties, only ECC can.  An example of what Risk is doing to the 
products after bridging is Tagg#Q79131 / EOL #555401.

RISK:  We need risk to verify that anytime, without exception, all companies 
with Master Agreements with ECC that hit a US product must be booked as two 
legs:  leg one booked between ECC and the counterparty with risk assignment 
of FT-US/CAND-ERMS; leg two flipping the risk out of FT-US/CAND-ERMS to the 
appropriate risk book.  Also, risk needs to verify that this is only for 
Financial Swaps and not Physical deals.  

IT:  It is my understanding that a few counterparties are set up to be booked 
correctly (with two legs).  The list is now up to 40 counterparties and will 
most likely be updated on a consistent basis.  Is this something that Tagg 
Maintenance can handle?  Guidelines need to be set up for Risk/Global to 
instruct IT when new Master Agreements are created with counterparties so 
logic can be adjusted accordingly.

Does a meeting need to be set up to elaborate on these issues?  Are there any 
further issues that need to be addressed concerning ECC Master Agreements?    
Please respond with your thoughts on this subject.

Thank you,
Dawn

How are you doing?  I hope your day is going well.

Let me apologize for anything I said last night, because I don't remember 
anything.  We went out for a COUPLE of drinks with a recruit, and I forgot 
that I only got 2 hours of sleepTuesday night.  I had 2 beers and 2 shots and 
was at home by 10 PM, but Tuesday nite took its toll.  I sat down for 5 
minutes and only woke up when I heard the cell phone ring.  I only remember 
picking the phone up to call you, but I don't  remember anything I said (I'm 
so sorry!).

Have a good rest of the day and call me when you get home.

ELM

As you might be aware,  Susan Scott (the book admin for the pipe option book) 
was forced by system problems to stay all night Wednesday night and until 200 
am Friday  in order to calc my book.  While she is scheduled to rotate to the 
West desk soon,  I think we need to discuss putting two persons on my book in 
order to bring the work load to a sustainable level.  I'd like to meet at 
2:30 pm on Monday to discuss this issue.  Please let me know if this time 
fits in your schedules.

Thanks,

Larry

Yes this is correct.  This is the reason Sherry and Amy have to flip out

We have new book names in TAGG for our intramonth portfolios and it is

Jim,

I really appreciate the offer.  Sorry for the delay in responding - things 
have been a little crazy.  I would like to accept the tickets for myself.  
Dutch is on vacation and I have left him a voicemail asking if he's is 
interested.  I will give you a call a little later in the day when things 
settle down.

Thanks,

Errol McLaughlin

below in red.  

We need this confirmation from risk as soon as possible.  We are pushing IT

hitting on US gas products on EOL and are not bridging into Tagg correctly.  
Currently, they are bridging as one leg between ENA and the counterparty.  
The problem arises during settlement because ENA cannot settle with these 
counterparties, only ECC can.  An example of what Risk is doing to the 
products after bridging is Tagg#Q79131 / EOL #555401.

RISK:  We need risk to verify that anytime, without exception, all companies 
with Master Agreements with ECC that hit a US product must be booked as two 
legs:  leg one booked between ECC and the counterparty with risk assignment 
of FT-US/CAND-ERMS; leg two flipping the risk out of FT-US/CAND-ERMS to the 
appropriate risk book.  Also, risk needs to verify that this is only for 
Financial Swaps and not Physical deals.  

IT:  It is my understanding that a few counterparties are set up to be booked 
correctly (with two legs).  The list is now up to 40 counterparties and will 
most likely be updated on a consistent basis.  Is this something that Tagg 
Maintenance can handle?  Guidelines need to be set up for Risk/Global to 
instruct IT when new Master Agreements are created with counterparties so 
logic can be adjusted accordingly.

Does a meeting need to be set up to elaborate on these issues?  Are there any 
further issues that need to be addressed concerning ECC Master Agreements?    
Please respond with your thoughts on this subject.

Thank you,
Dawn

Subject: Counterparties w/ Master Agreements with ECC

I have received an updated list of the counterparties that have Master 
Agreements with ECC.  There are now about 40 counterparties that fall under 
this category.  What seems to be happening is that these counterparties are 
hitting on US gas products on EOL and are not bridging into Tagg correctly.  
Currently, they are bridging as one leg between ENA and the counterparty.  
The problem arises during settlement because ENA cannot settle with these 
counterparties, only ECC can.  An example of what Risk is doing to the 
products after bridging is Tagg#Q79131 / EOL #555401.

RISK:  We need risk to verify that anytime, without exception, all companies 
with Master Agreements with ECC that hit a US product must be booked as two 
legs:  leg one booked between ECC and the counterparty with risk assignment 
of FT-US/CAND-ERMS; leg two flipping the risk out of FT-US/CAND-ERMS to the 
appropriate risk book.  Also, risk needs to verify that this is only for 
Financial Swaps and not Physical deals.  

IT:  It is my understanding that a few counterparties are set up to be booked 
correctly (with two legs).  The list is now up to 40 counterparties and will 
most likely be updated on a consistent basis.  Is this something that Tagg 
Maintenance can handle?  Guidelines need to be set up for Risk/Global to 
instruct IT when new Master Agreements are created with counterparties so 
logic can be adjusted accordingly.

Does a meeting need to be set up to elaborate on these issues?  Are there any 
further issues that need to be addressed concerning ECC Master Agreements?    
(i.e. What about when a counterparty with ECC Master Agreement hits a 
Canadian product out of the Houston office?)  
Please respond with your thoughts on this subject.

Thank you,
Dawn

Longhorns have to show they can make it into October without a loss.=20
=09
=09=20
=09
=09
=09Longhorn Q & A=20
=09 Q: Judging from the Stanford game (as well as the last three games of l=
ast=20
season) it looks like the trend of blitzing the Horns will continue. There =
is=20
also no respect for our running game from any team that we face. I think th=
e=20
best way to end this strategy against us is to become the aggressor on=20
offense and not sit back passively and react to what the defense is giving=
=20
us. =20
=09
=09In order for us to achieve this, I think it starts with us putting our b=
est=20
athletes on the field on offense. These guys may not be the most experience=
d=20
players, but they will gain experience with playing time, and they have the=
=20
ability to make a team pay for selling out with the blitz. It's time to sta=
rt=20
Roy Williams and B.J. Johnson at receiver (along with Montrell Flowers) and=
=20
play a one-back offensive set. Our fullbacks are not a threat offensively a=
nd=20
Hodges Mitchell is not an I-back who is adept at following the fullback=20
through the hole. Hodges' strength is operating in space and making people=
=20
miss in the open field.=20
=09
=09I also think Chris Simms needs to get the bulk of the minutes at quarter=
back.=20
Major Applewhite has all the intangibles in the world but Simms could (and=
=20
probably does) possess all of the same skills. He just hasn't had the chanc=
e=20
to display them. We desperately need to have all playmakers on the field if=
=20
we are going to turn this thing around. If not, I could see this season=20
slipping to 7-4 real quick. What are your thoughts, Chip?=20
=09 ?? The Jackson residence=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  With any unexpected loss, the tendency is to throw everyone out=
 -=20
change coaches, players, even the bus driver. You do that and you are telli=
ng=20
this team that you have absolutely no confidence in them. There can't be to=
o=20
much change at any one time. The big question is how the team responds to=
=20
this Stanford loss emotionally. Something tells me if Texas can find some=
=20
resolve and perform really well, you'll see some solid performances at all=
=20
the positions where problems currently exist. In 1996, Texas was No. 6 and=
=20
Notre Dame was No. 9. Texas had the game won in Austin and then lost. UT th=
en=20
lost three of its next four, which included games against Oklahoma State,=
=20
Oklahoma and Colorado - all teams Texas is about to face after this week's=
=20
opponent, Houston.=20
=09
=09That was a different coach and different players. But the common thread =
was=20
that Texas hit the top 10 and then choked. If Texas is hung over from its=
=20
loss to Stanford, trouble could be on the horizon. If Texas can find resolv=
e=20
to show everyone that Stanford truly was a game in which everything that=20
could go wrong did, then I think the Longhorns will bounce back and be a ha=
rd=20
team to beat the rest of the way. Tuesday night Mack Brown said the Longhor=
ns=20
are not a very good football team right now. The challenge has been made to=
=20
his team. If they come out and stink against Houston, every position will b=
e=20
scrutinized, every coach, even the bus driver. There will be enough fire=20

t=20

=09 BROWN:  As the QBs turn. This week, it appears Chris Simms will start=

because he was practicing with the first team on Tuesday. That has been the=
=20
trend. Whoever practices with the first team gets the start. Anyway, we'll=
=20
see how they respond after the Stanford game. Major Applewhite was erratic =
in=20
his play, despite almost leading the Longhorns back from the dead to a=20
miraculous victory. I'm sticking to my theory that the coaches want to see=
=20
what Simms can do against Houston before picking one or the other =20
=09
=09to get solo duty in the Oklahoma and Colorado games. =20
=09
=09Granted, if one struggles along the way, the other will come in. But Mac=

Brown said they primarily went with Applewhite against Stanford because of=

his experience and the fact that it was the team's first game on the road. =
He=20
said they still have all the faith in the world in Simms. It would seem to =

=09
=09I keep trying to remind myself that Brown did this twice at North Caroli=

of coming back and giving us a chance to win. Sometimes youth doesn't look=

=09?? Dave Stastny, Austin=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  The receivers say the varying spins are not a factor when catch=

What are the rules on redshirting a player after the season starts? I know=

=09?? Chad Graham=20
=09

=09
=09Q: Don't know whether you can address any or all of these questions in y=
our=20
column, but I've seen some unflattering trends in Mack Brown's program and=
=20
wanted your feedback. Mack Brown is a great recruiter, no argument there.=
=20
However, can he motivate? It seems like he can't get the team "up" sometime=
s=20
and can't adjust the team's mood during a game.=20
=09
=09About offensive coordinator Greg Davis, I don't know who is responsible =
for=20
the offensive line but since it is an offensive group, in more ways than on=
e,=20
I put it under him. With guys the size that UT has, shouldn't even Hodges=
=20
Mitchell be able to run? Who tagged Leonard Davis as a pro? Why does Davis=
=20
love Mitchell? Sure, he gained 1,300-plus yards last year, but how many of=
=20
those yards were "move=20
=09
=09 the chains" type of runs that allowed UT to hold the ball on the ground=
 and=20
protect a lead? I thought it was going to be running back by committee but=
=20
all we have seen is the coaches continuing the same mistake - abandoning th=
e=20
run and using the wrong back for the wrong situations.=20
=09
=09Mitchell can run to the outside, but he cannot run through the defensive=
=20
tackles. And even if he does get holes, he still will never break through t=
he=20
linebackers for a TD. Why not put Ivan Williams or Kenny Hayter back there=
=20
with Mitchell and go with a two-back, three-wide offense? You don't lose a=
=20
receiver as Hodges is a nice, smart receiver.
=09
=09Other ramblings: Is Quentin Jammer really a corner? He got beat MANY tim=
e=20
against Stanford. I loved his hitting when he played safety but his injury=
=20
may have forever changed his game if he can't play safety and can't keep up=
=20
with opponent's wideouts.

=09How is the defensive end position shaping up? The defensive tackles were=
 all=20

Stockton take too long? Is he too close to the line? Can the line block? Ca=

=09?? Andrew Bowen=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I think your feelings are shared by many Texas fans who are=20
incredibly pained, shocked, disappointed, angered and hurt by last Saturday=
's=20
events. But in talking to Mack Brown on Tuesday, he said it's fair to beat=
=20
the team up for not being able to run the ball. But he said to jump on any=
=20
other part of the team is to rip young, inexperienced kids who are still=20
learning what it takes to compete as a top-ranked team.=20
=09
=09To be fair to Brown, he did say repeatedly that his team was overrated a=
nd=20
needed time to grow into some key positions - receiver, defensive end,=20
fullback and some positions on the offensive line and at corner. It probabl=
y=20
isn't fair to question whether Mack Brown can motivate because his teams di=
d=20
beat Nebraska twice, Oklahoma twice and Texas A=02?once. If a trend develop=
s,=20
and Texas falls apart the rest of the season, there will be a fair question=
=20
about whether Brown did a good enough job of keeping his team's head screwe=
d=20
on straight. But it's typical after losses to want to shred every part of t=
he=20
team.=20
=09
=09Brown said before the season that as soon as something went wrong, the=
=20
quarterback situation would be blamed. And he was right. The QBs are still=
=20
working hard, and look for Simms to start this week against Houston. There'=
s=20
no question that the O-line is struggling, but so are the backs and so are=
=20
the receivers. Brown said only two of the five sacks were the fault of the=
=20
line. He said the other three were caused by miscommunication between=20
Applewhite and the receivers, causing Applewhite to hold the ball too long.=
=20
=09
=09Mitchell was standing too deep in the backfield against Stanford, so it =
was=20
taking him too long to get to the holes. The coaches were not happy about=
=20
that. They were yelling at him to move up. He should only be 6 1/2 yards=20
deep. But he was sometimes at 9 yards. Mitchell also struggled with some=20
blitz pickup, which is uncharacteristic of him. So look for Victor Ike,=20
Hayter and possibly Williams to get a little time against Houston.=20
=09
=09Coaches are still high on Jammer. Again, he hasn't played corner much in=
=20
games after moving from safety. But coaches are not thinking of moving him.=
=20
The defensive end position is a big concern with defensive coordinator Carl=
=20
Reese. He is willing to rifle through his whole pile until he finds a coupl=
e=20
who can really play. Cory Redding was better than usual against Stanford. B=
ut=20
that position still needs a lot of work. The blocked punt occurred because=
=20
one player, who blocked perfectly on 11 other punts Saturday night, failed =
to=20
block a player coming right up the middle, which guarantees doom. That play=
er=20
has been chewed out every which way.
=09
=09As far as the penalties, there were several questionable calls. But Brow=
n,=20
who did a lot of yelling at officials during the Stanford game, couldn't sa=
y=20
anything about it after the game because he would be fined. Texas can still=
=20
have a good season, and perhaps having these problem areas pointed out so=
=20
early will help in that direction. We'll see if Texas takes this loss=20
constructively or destructively.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: Last year at times I saw blazing speed and ability from Cory Redding=
. I=20
know he was considered by many to be the best high school defensive player =
in=20
the country in 1998. I've waited all off-season to see him explode against=
=20
teams this year. I haven't seen it yet. Maybe this week against Stanford. M=
y=20
question is, why was he moved from his high school position of linebacker=
=20
where he was dominant into the defensive end role where he seems undersized=
=20
and average? Is Texas that low on defensive line talent? It seems our=20
recruiting has been great. Please help me understand. Hook 'em Horns!=20
=09?? Ernie McAnally=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Redding told me recently that linebacker is still his first lov=
e.=20
But he said coaches came to him last year and said he could get on the fiel=
d=20
right away as a defensive end. Coaches also feel that his body (6-5, 260) i=
s=20
perfect for the DE position. He's tall, athletic, fast and has long arms. I=
n=20
time, coaches feel Redding will develop into an All-America player. But the=
re=20
is no question that he has struggled against the run. He made some big play=
s=20
against Stanford, recording six tackles, three of them for losses and=20
blocking an extra point attempt. He is just a sophomore. Over this season a=
nd=20
the next two years, he should only get better.=20

LaDainian Tomlinson. How much did UT spend on its campaign for Ricky=20

=09
=09 BROWN:  Texas didn't spend that much money at all. They produced a few=

Errol,

I am still interested in selling the car; I have a couple driving in from
Austin next weekend who are really serious about buying the car. I started a
new business (see below) and need a 4 door car.

The specifications:

1998 Porsche Boxster, Metallic Blue, Black top with black interior, 23,400
miles, $37,500, 17" wheels, CD player, cruise control, heated mirrors, power
seats, automatic climate control, factory alarm, 5-speed, power top, power
windows, remote trunk release, gold Porsche badges (on wheels as well).

Performance:  0-60 mph 6.4 seconds / 150 mph top speed / 201 hp 2.5 liter
flat six engine

Errol - if you are interested let me know ASAP; Jennifer (Austin couple) is
pretty serious about the purchase. I also have a 1995 Triumph Speed Triple
with 8,200 miles (bought new in 8/96) that I am looking to sell for $4,800.
Comes with lots of accessories.

The story:

I bought the car in 10/99 with 5,300 from West Side Infiniti (Houston). An
older gentleman traded in the car for a Q45 (he had the Porsche for a year;
had a hard time getting in and out of the car). The record (call Momentum
Porsche in Houston - all record on file) show that the car had an oil change
at 2,000 miles, 4,200 miles, 14,000 miles (15,000 mile check up). The car
currently has 23,400 miles on it. I have had no problems with the car and is
in perfect running condition.

The original Pirelli P-Zero's lasted me until 21,555 (quite a feat
considering that they run out at 14,000 - 18,000 miles). I replaced the
tires with Pirelli P7000 Super Sports (better 4 season tire and longer tread
life without sacrificing handling). I also had the shop align the car to
factory settings.

The car has been garaged all of the time. I used to work in downtown and
live in downtown so the car barely was driven during the weekdays. The car
is driven more on a daily basis. I used to own a BMW Z3 so taking care of
German cabriolets is comes second hand. The car has never been in a wreck
and is in perfect condition in every aspect. The interior color is black and
again in perfect condition. Please let me if you are interested and I will
be more than happy to let you test drive the car or take it to your mechanic
for an inspection (or arrange a screening with one of the Porsche dealers to
inspect the car).

Please feel free to contact me at either numbers below.

Errol and Phillip,
Can we get together on Thursday or Friday to discuss the Utility Track for 
the 2 new Analysts that will join your group this summer.  The objective of 
this track is to have the 2 analysts serve in a Business Unit, but rotate 
function/roles as needs change.  We need to identify responsibilities the 
analysts could have at each desk. Please let me know what time works best for 
you.
Regards,
Melissa Prihoda

Effective, February 1, 2001, ENW Contractors are required to utilize the=20
SAP/CATS systems to record all time worked.  Each Cost Center Owner is=20
responsible for keeping track of their Contractors=01, hours on a monthly b=
asis,=20
as well as ensuring Contractor compliance with this mandate.

At the end of each month, ENW Accounting is providing Contractor reporting =
to=20
Office of the Chair.  However, the accuracy of this report is dependent on=
=20
Contractors entering their time into SAP.

As a result, going forward, a second =01&non-compliance=018 report will be=
=20
submitted to Office of the Chair on a monthly basis, detailing Contractors=
=20
not entering their time and the Contractor supervisor.  Please contact Dian=
e=20
Latson (X5-7184) if you believe your contractors are exceptions and should=
=20
not be entering time.

Contractor Time Entry

Contractors are required to enter their time in eHRonline to one of the=20
following: (1) project numbers, which are called WBS Elements; (2) cost=20
centers, which are associated to a specific department and not a formal=20
project.  It is the Supervisor=01,s responsibility to ensure Contractors ar=
e=20
provided with the proper project or cost center coding.

Unlike invoice coding, SAP will only accept a Cost Center or WBS element=20
number for each time entry line.  This means that you cannot enter a Cost=
=20
Center and a WBS element number on the same line.  SAP will read this=20
information from left to right and will only pick up the first entry.  For=
=20
example:

  CostCenter  WBS Element  =20
  123456  c.9999.99.99.99 =20

The system will look at this entry and all time will be charged as expense =
to=20
Cost Center 123456.=20

Any questions regarding  time entry coding should be directed to ISC HR=20
support x5-4727.

Please red the paragragh in red below from an e-mail I sent last month....

I need risk to confirm that all counterparties that have master agreements 
with ECC (now 41 counterparties) need to be booked with 2 legs as described 
below in red.  

We need this confirmation from risk as soon as possible.  We are pushing IT 
to get this logic in place and don't want anything to "blow up" for risk.  
Please respond by e-mail.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Subject: Counterparties w/ Master Agreements with ECC

I have received an updated list of the counterparties that have Master 
Agreements with ECC.  There are now about 40 counterparties that fall under 
this category.  What seems to be happening is that these counterparties are 
hitting on US gas products on EOL and are not bridging into Tagg correctly.  
Currently, they are bridging as one leg between ENA and the counterparty.  
The problem arises during settlement because ENA cannot settle with these 
counterparties, only ECC can.  An example of what Risk is doing to the 
products after bridging is Tagg#Q79131 / EOL #555401.

RISK:  We need risk to verify that anytime, without exception, all companies 
with Master Agreements with ECC that hit a US product must be booked as two 
legs:  leg one booked between ECC and the counterparty with risk assignment 
of FT-US/CAND-ERMS; leg two flipping the risk out of FT-US/CAND-ERMS to the 
appropriate risk book.  Also, risk needs to verify that this is only for 
Financial Swaps and not Physical deals.  

IT:  It is my understanding that a few counterparties are set up to be booked 
correctly (with two legs).  The list is now up to 40 counterparties and will 
most likely be updated on a consistent basis.  Is this something that Tagg 
Maintenance can handle?  Guidelines need to be set up for Risk/Global to 
instruct IT when new Master Agreements are created with counterparties so 
logic can be adjusted accordingly.

Does a meeting need to be set up to elaborate on these issues?  Are there any 
further issues that need to be addressed concerning ECC Master Agreements?    
Please respond with your thoughts on this subject.

Thank you,
Dawn

This book is for a VPP deal with the affiliate Star VPP, LP.  The Price desk 
has swaps with this counterparty and the other regional desks have basis 
deals.  The deals went into the system last night.  The Post ID's were 
1045874 (price) and 1045878 (basis).  Kori is running the book just like she 
does the other affiliate books.

I have encountered the following problems calcing at home.

1.  On my Portcalc screen, everything was very tiny.  It worked but I know I 
couldn't copy a post id because I wouldn't be able to see the new number.

2.  I wanted to look at my curves last night and they opened up with errors.  
Basically it's like opening up the curves on a machine without the correct 
drivers.  Seems like we need to put those drivers on the network and maybe 
upgrade it to Oracle 8i too.

3.  I don't know how we can change the printer to print at home.  Only 
concern here is if we are offsite and have a local printer (will we be able 
to put that printer on the network?).  

That's all I can think of right now.

Any suggestions?

Dave

Dutch,

Do you know if it will cause any problems for the IT group to archive:  
o:\erms\erms_adm\NYMEX\1999?  The erms folder is out of disk space.

Thanks,

Errol

The ERMS folder is out of disk space again.  I managed to free up again 2 to 
3gb about 2 weeks ago but we are back down to 450mb.  I found a folder that I 
would like to archive but I wanted to check with you first.  

o:\erms\erms_adm\NYMEX\1999   

I would like to archive about 6 or 7 months out of this folder.  The oldest 7 
are Jan, May, Feb, Mar, Apr, Jun, and Aug.

Otherwise I don't know what else to archive?  I am open to suggestions.

Thanks

Sue,

I am sending you this e-mail because I received your voice message well after 
you left it today.  I reviewed the text files that are sent out by the book 
administrators on my desks and none of them contain any deals booked to the 
counterparty El Paso Gas Marketing.  All of the deals from people on my desk 
are booked to the valid El Paso counterparty per our conversations.

I will be out of the office tomorrow, but I will be checking my voicemail 
frequently and communicating with my group.  If the same problem arises 
tomorrow, please call me at 713-305-1502 so that we can discuss, because 
there has to be some other explanation for the erroneous counterparty showing 
up on your report.

Thank you,

Errol McLaughlin, X5-8274

Hey Errol,
Over the holidays I heard that you were working at Enron and I thought I'd
say hi.  How are things going for you?  How's your family doing?  I am
good...just working at Sprint in Finance and going to school for my MBA.
Well, holler back when you get a moment.

 I appreciate everyone's help in making sure that all the information for 
Lagrasta's originated is deals is accurate.  He is now receiving a daily 
report with all originated deals.  

 He has also asked that we give him the data on the deals that his group has 
done that do not have origination.  Therefore,  going forward we will need to 
put all deals for Lagrasta's group into the origination file.  Meaning,  if 
his group does a deal where no origination is granted,  you will need to put 
all the relevant information into the origination file and just put a $0 for 
the Origination granted on the report.  Thanks so much for your help.

Deal NL3722 is a deal between ECC and another counterparty.  It is not a John 
Arnold deal.  You will have to contact Ryan in Canada re: this deal.

Everything looks correct, except for Friday, November 23, 2001.  Truong had 
this day listed as a holiday.  It is not a holiday -- the exchange will close 
early at 12 noon CST.

Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total 
car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing 
provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value 
proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first 
choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract 
reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and 
low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, 
where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or 
Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate 
selected: 
1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or 
Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for 
any damage to it. 
2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. 
For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 
per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following 
contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded 
on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)
To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's 
preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in 
National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club 
membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the 
transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid 
return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron 
travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron 
American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on 
the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact Jeff Leath at 
713-646-6165.

PLEASE READ AND FOLLOW TO THE LETTER, yes the bolded and unbolded letters.
I was in the room when Lavorato said that if something was "top levelled" it 
was fraud, so lets not
be the ones defrauding the company and having to explain that in Lavorato's 
office.

Thanks

The broker Amerex is no longer under the short name of AMERX in deal 
capture.  From this point on, the short name is AMERG, which stands for 
Amerex Natural Gas, Ltd.  AMERX will now default to Amerex Petroleum, which 
is incorrect.  Also, the broker Spectron is no longer SPECT.  The new short 
name is SPECI, which stands for Spectron Energy, Inc. 

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Thanks,

Subject: Trading Track Information

As you know, we are working on an on-boarding process to get the trading 
track participants up to speed as quickly as possible in each of their 
respective rotations.  One of the methods of doing this is to have each 
rotational supervisor (you're one of them) put a few points together to 
present to each participant on the first day of their rotation with you (or 
someone in your group).  

For example:
What does you group do as a whole?  The Risk Management Group is responsible 
for providing information to the trading floor.  That information consists of 
positions,  p&l,  and other general information which may be needed by the 
floor throughout the day.  The information must be 100% accurate 100% of the 
time as the gas floor is taking positions based on the information they are 
given.  In addition,  all reports go to SR.  Management such as John Lavorato 
and Dave Delaney.

The participants need to know several logistics type things such as:
 where to sit
 User tips on the use of related business hardware (i.e. phone system, 
intercom, etc.)
 How long/when or if to take lunch: use your discretion.
 Expected working hours: Expect to be in the office no later than 8:00 and 
preferably by 7:30

It is also important to cover the expected learning criteria with the 
participants on their first day:
 able to work under pressure - You will be asked to provide reports and 
answers to questions on the floor quickly.  You will be expected to know and 
understand the information that you are giving.
 ability to handle multiple priorities - There will be times when you are 
faced with several tasks at once.  You will be expected to make quick 
decisions and understand which is the most important.
 meets deadlines - Everyday in Risk you have to meet a deadline.  The traders 
must have positions and p&l on their desks when they walk in in the morning.
 Excellent written communication - Your written communication will be in the 
numbers that you provide to the floor.
 Excellent oral communication - Again,  the traders will expect answers and 
expect them quickly.  You will need to articulate those in a fashion that is 
understandable.
 Effective interpersonal skills -  see above.
 Attention to detail - This is one of the most important considerations of 
the job.  Again,  all information must be 100% accurate,  errors are not 
acceptable.
 Team player -  You will be expected to work across all groups upstream and 
downstream to provide accurate information and solve related problems.
 Excellent organisational skills - speed and accuracy are a hallmark of the 
job,  therefore you will need to be organized at all times.
 Is a motivated worker -  self explainatory
 Excellent analytical skills - same
 Maintains relationships with traders -  The trader will be relying on the 
information that you provide him.  Therefore it is important that he trusts 
what you are giving to him and that you are always asking if they need more 
or better information.
 Effective time management -  self explainatory
 Competent in Excel -  Alot of the work we do is in excel.  It is important 
that you be able to navigate excel, as well as create efficiencies to make 
the job less prone to errors and to run more smoothly.
 Competent with ERMS - ERMS is the system that is used to maintain positions 
and p&l.  All deals flow through this system and all values related to deals 
come from this system.
 Competent with Risktrac - Risktrac is the system that tracks counterparty 
risk and Value at Risk.  I expect you to understand what each means,  what 
the limits are,  and how you can reduce and add to value at risk.
 Demonstrates knowledge of trading concepts - Work with the traders to 
understand why they are putting on the positions that they have.  Try to 
understand proper hedging strategies etc.

Each participant who comes to your area needs to know your interpretation of 
each of these competencies so they can make sure to meet your expectations 
while in your area.

Also, the participants need to fully understand exactly what they'll be doing 
in your area.  Let 'em know with as much detail as possible.

Finally, Do you consider any information a pre-requisite for participation in 
your area ?(i.e. Advanced Excel skills...etc)
I'd like to know so we can push the participants to get the needed training 
before coming to your group.  Advanced Excel skills,  preferably a level of 
understanding of positions and value at risk.

Please compile this information and forward it to me so I can put it into 
some on-boarding material for all of the candidates by their first day of 
rotations.

The first candidates will begin on February 1, 2001.  

Thank you very much for you time and consideration.

Hi Errol & Sherry,

We received confirmations for the above referenced
deals from Paribas (they confirm us) and Paribas' confirm
differs from what we show in TAGG.  Paribas' trader, Herve,
says that he spoke with John Arnold after the deal was done 
and changed the price from 8.15 to 8.14 and the index from
Gas Daily to NYMEX.     TAGG still reflects the terms that
EOL has.  

Can one of you please find out if John Arnold agreed to these
changes, and if so, can you make the necessary changes
to TAGG?  

Let me know.
Thanks a lot,
Diane

Kam,

$100 sounds like a good idea.  I'm not close to a golfsmith, though. (sorry)

Please disregard the first e-mail I sent.  I am sorry for the confusion.  
This file has the correct positions, both NYMEX and OTC, that you requested.

Dawn,

John Arnold is now hitting the crude oil stacks.  Currently the deals are 
booking to NG-Price.  Attached is a completed new book request form with the 
short name for his new crude book - NG-Price-Crude.  We are changing the 
deals to the new book today, but we need them to start booking automatically 
tomorrow, if possible.  We can discuss in the meeting at 4 pm.

Thanks, 

Errol

We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change=
s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=
=20
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit=
y=20
for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=
orth=20
America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=
=20
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=
he=20
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=
=20
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=
=20
will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =
of=20
the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=
ness=20
into Enron Global Assets in the near future.
=20
Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined=
=20
EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi=
ll=20
focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to=
=20
the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE=
S=20
to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or=
der=20
to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20
facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for=
=20
at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout=
h=20
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=
=20
businesses and the commercial support functions:

Enron Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=
 and=20
CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20

Enron Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for=

into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility=
=20
for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20
Americas.

Enron Europe
The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust=

President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=
y,=20
the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in=
=20
the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=

efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=
=20
EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These=
=20
newly defined roles are as follows:

Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=
e=20
Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works,=
=20
with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20
President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat=
ed=20
services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these=
=20
services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=
=20
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=
=20
for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.
Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.
Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =
on a=20
regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in=
=20
the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all=
=20
European and Eastern Hemisphere operations.  Rick and Mark will also contin=
ue=20
to support all other Enron businesses operating in their respective regions=
=20
and will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chi=
ef=20
of Staff.
Public Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a region=
al=20
basis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity,=20
Enron Net Works, and Enron Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue=
=20
in her role for Enron Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble=
r=20

Deal NN6788.1 with Citibank has been killed.  This was an EOL deal that 
Citibank and John Arnold agreed to cut in half.  Deal QF9221.1 was booked in 
Dec. for half the volume of the original deal.  Unfortunately, deal NN6788.1 
was not killed when we booked the new deal.  Please call me with any 
questions.

Thanks,

Errol, X5-8274

Errol,

Could you take a look at these two Option/Call deals that successfully 
bridged into Tagg( 750242/QK1859 & 750296/QK1897).  Also, take note that the 
swaps did not bridge into Tagg as requested ( 750297 & 750243), and will 
remain in failed status until further notice.  Everything looks great on our 
end!

One deal failed simply because John Arnold logged in as the buyer and acted 
as the seller.  This only happened once. ( 750209 Option, and 750210 Swap)

Torrey,

What is the plan for all swaps that have been requested to end up in failed 
status ?  

 ( Look under Torrey and Errol Tab)



Thanks
TARA

Subject: 8:30 Meeting on systems

There is a 30 minute meeting every morning on the 28th floor at 8:30 about 
systems issues from the prior night and to discuss what books were not 
officialized.  I have gone to this meeting this week, and I think that we 
should always have a representative in the meeting.  Here is what I propose:  
We alternate weeks going to this meeting.

Week of :
Dec. 4   - Jeff Gossett
Dec. 11 - Darron Giron
Dec. 18 - David Baumbach
Dec. 25 - Will Kelly
Jan. 1    -  Kam Keiser
Jan. 8    - Errol Mclaughlin

And then we will start over again.
If you can not go,  make sure that someone goes in your place.

Thanks

Irena and Elizabeth -  Can you please add these daily meetings to the 
appropriate calender?

Thanks

Jeremy,

John and I really need to meet Tuesday for about 30min-1hr with you Dave and 
Sanjeev, so that we can better understand how the options are being calc'd in 
the system.  We thought we had a pretty good idea after talking on Friday, 
but tonight we see that we don't.  John is about one half million dollars off 
every night in his prediction of the P/L for Mike's book, and we're afraid 
our position might not be correct as well.

Please give me a call.

Thanks,

Errol, X5-8274

Subject: Vega Issue - Vol. Smile

John:

The reason for the large Vega numbers on the TopPage report, while there were 
no corresponding changes in the Volatility curves, is due to the change in 
the mid. price for the current day versus the prior day. The corresponding 
volatility skews that are added to the vols. for the 2 days is causing the 
large vega numbers.

For example, for deal number QV5087.2 (exp. date 01-Jan-2002):

  Current Day  Prior Day
Mid. Price 5.885   5.772
Strike Price 3.5   3.5
Mid - Strike 2.385   2.272
Vol.  0.555   0.555
Vol. Skew 0.03816   0.03635
Actual Vol. 0.59316   0.59135

Option value for prior day using current day's vol. =  7,616,935  
Option value for prior day using prior day's vol.     =  7,547,238 
Vega                =  69,697

Thank you,
Jeremy

Subject: Option Logic

Now that the tagg test environment is running, I have tested the option logic 
with the new NG-Exotic book.  Please review the following deals in tagg stage 
and let me know if this is correct.

QQ7966 Call Option
QQ7967 Hedge

If this is the way it should be booked in tagg, it is all contingent on Mike 
Maggi deleting the current option suites active on option manager, recreating 
them and selecting NG-Exotic as the risk book under the auto hedge 
selection.  We will be more than happy to provide assistance, if needed.  If 
you approve, we will place this logic into production this evening after 
trading.

If this does not look correct or if you have any further questions, please 
contact Dawn (3-9353) or Tara (3-4523).  

Thank you for your help!

Due to problems experienced by TAGG Deal Capture users a couple of weeks ago, 
we have made some modifications that will change the process of how a deal 
ticket is produced. Under the previous process, a user will request a Deal 
ticket to be generated and the TAGG application would basically schedule a 
job to generate and print the report on UNIX. The amount of time between the 
moment the user would click on the button to generate Deal Ticket and the 
time the actual ticket  printed was dependent on the amount of activity in 
the whole TAGG system. This time would range from about one minute to several 
minutes. Also, sometimes the ticket would never print. On the new version of 
the application, the report is generated directly from the user's machine and 
it will print on the default printer used by all the other windows 
applications on user's machine.  For  those users using dial-up, the 
processing will be done on the dial-up machine and the report will print on 
the default printer attached to the dial-up machine. From the user's point of 
view, in order to generate a Deal Ticket they need to follow exactly the same 
steps they were doing before. The processing going on behind the scenes will 
be different, but report will print almost instantaneously. Every effort has 
been made to replicate the report as close as possible, but there will be 
minor differences in formatting between old and new reports. 
We have put the new version of the TAGG application in the staging area. 
Please feel free to test it and verify that the information shown on Deal 
Ticket report is accurate. We have received feedback from people in London, 
Calgary and Singapore verifying that new version of report is correct. We are 
currently planning to roll this change into production the weekend of March 
10. If you have questions/problems or suggestions related to these changes, 
please notify Oscar Rivera x5-3361 or Sanjeev Gupta x5-3816 asap. 

thanks,

Oscar Rivera

Dear Errol Mclaughlin Jr,

Your December 2000 Citibank statement reflected a higher credit line 
than your November statement, because your account earned a credit 
line increase in December. 

An email sent to you on January 15, 2001, was intended as a 
confirmation of that December increase. 

Congratulations once again on your credit line increase. 

Kendall E. Stork 
President and CEO 
Citibank (South Dakota), N.A.

Jeff will assume the role at a time when the company is hitting on all=20

In the future,  if you have a book that had deals with a third party,  and 
you move those deals out of that book or change that book to another book you 
have to officialize that book after it has nothing in it.  The reason being,  
if someone does not officialize an old book the credit group pulls the last 
available information.  Confusing enough??  Let me know if you need further 
explaination.

All:

This is to inform you that the as of today 02/26/01 the Gas group will be 
officializing a new book, NG-PR-OPT-PRC.  This book will capture the Options 
portion of the NG-PRICE-PRC.  Over the weekend the Option deals were 
tranfered to the new book and test Calc without problems.  For anyone 
manually pulling in data related to the NG-PRICE-PRC or NG-PRICE2-PRC you 
should adjust your procedures to insure that need data is captured from ERMS 
system using the new book and no duplicate data is captured.  On the ERMS 
system the book id is NG-PR-OPT.  


Errol:  To insure that credit does not capture old data related to the 
RisktRAC bookID NG-PRICE2-PRC can you please calc that book to zero for one 
last time.  You should use the same procedures previously used to isolate the 
Options piece from the book.  To insure that  we do not cause problems for 
the Cash Flow group please calc the options piece first and then the swaps.  
This will insure that the Swaps data is properly capture for the IR/FX 
group.  If you have any questions please call me at ext 54751



Regards,


Nancy

Errol,

There are two trades that were done with Mirant Americas through 
Intercontinental Exchange.  TAGG does not reflect these trades.  I faxed the 
broker statements to Sherry D. and she stated that she forwarded them to 
you.  Trade dates were on Nov. 13th and Nov. 14.  I also asked Joe Hunter to 
check into this and he stated that he had spoken to you some time last week 
or the week before and stated that you would be getting back with me on the 
TAGG deal numbers.
 
When I querried TAGG this morning selecting Intercontinental Exchange as the 
broker, no deals were found.

Can you please let me know the deal numbers as these trades need to be 
settled as soon as possible.

Thanks,
Mechelle

Subject: How do officialized books make it to credit?

In the past few months much focus has been put on understanding VAR and how 
it is calculated (through RisktRAC).  However, everyone should note that the 
credit department also receives our information.  Market risk and credit risk 
are inherently different, with different requirements.  This memo serves as a 
reminder of what some of the key differences are, how the credit system uses 
RisktRAC differently from market risk, how this affects us, what some key 
problems are in the credit system caused by our data, and changes to be made 
by risk management groups.

differences are between credit and market risk - you all know this, but many 
of your ba's don't. 
when a book is flat it still has an effect on credit.  Flat books must be 
officialized
market risk is keyed off positions and curves.  When we make money, market 
risk is reduced.  Credit risk is keyed off positions with customers.  When we 
make money, credit risk is increased, as people owe us more money.

how the credit system uses RisktRAC differently from market risk
Market risk picks up all officialized books.  If a book is not officialized 
it does not pick the book up.
Credit picks up all officalized books.  If a book is not officialized, it 
picks up the previous day's position.  Therefore, if positions in book A are 
moved to book B, and A is no longer officialized, credit picks up the 
previous day's position for book A.  As a result, if a book is no longer 
used, please officialize it the first day it is no longer used, so credit 
will pick up 0 on a go forward basis.
Market risk is not concerned with counterparty codes and names.
Credit needs correct counterparty codes and names.  In recent months, the 
counterparty information has deteriorated.  Enron official counterparty names 
need to be used so they flow properly to credit.

what are some key problems in the credit system caused by our data
As referenced above: correct counterparty names and books with 0 positions 
not being officialized so credit picks up previous day info.
As a takeaway from this message please ensure only correct counterparty names 
are used and that if a book has 0 positions that it is officialized the first 
day it has 0 positions.

If you have specific questions about credit, please call Debbie Brackett, at 
X35856.

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook 
client will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail 
via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is 
configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is 
migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your 
web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and 
To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook 
client is configured on your desktop.

2. Remote access to your mailbox.
After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) 
for remote access to your mailbox.

PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while 
connecting to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA 
available from your home or when traveling abroad.

HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  
http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe

Substitute "john.doe" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You 
will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in "corp/your user 
id" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You 
will now be able to view your mailbox.

 

PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between 
the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things 
in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the 
functions NOT available via OWA:

Features NOT available using OWA:

-  Tasks
-  Journal
-  Spell Checker
-  Offline Use
-  Printing Templates
-  Reminders
-  Timed Delivery
-  Expiration
-  Outlook Rules
-  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall
-  Sharing Contacts with others
-  Task Delegation
-  Direct Resource Booking
-  Personal Distribution Lists

QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?

If you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the 
Outlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at:

 Outlook.2000@enron.com

Otherwise, you may contact the Resolution Center at:

 713-853-1411

Errol,   This is what I spoke to you about on the phone...

In order to prepare for the new Broker-Client application that EOL will be 
supporting, we need to clean up the EOL deals in tagg.  We have found alot of 
deals in tagg that have EOL in the broker field, but no EOL deal number.  
Most of these are due to second legs being added manually after the EOL 
transaction, or the EOL deal number being deleted from the tagg leg.  We are 
asking risk to go thru these deals and add the EOL deal number to the legs 
that do not have the deal number listed.  

For example, if the deal is two (+) legs and only one leg has the EOL number 
on it and clearly the other legs are associated with the one EOL transaction, 
manually enter the EOL deal number into the remaining legs.  

Attached is the list of deals.  I spot checked several of these and pretty 
much found the common trend of one leg has just EOL in the broker field and 
the second leg has EOL in the broker field and an EOL deal number.  I have 
seperated the list into different tabs by counterparty name.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Dawn

This morning it was discovered that a portion of John Arnold's Gas Daily 
position was being captured incorrectly as a February fixed price position 
instead of a February Index position.  I am currently working on  the problem 
and the positions will be captured correctly tonight.  John is aware of the 
situation and has stated that V@R does not need to be re-run.

Thanks,

To contribute our personal best at ENRON, our conduct must promote respectful

potential harm, we can prevent it in our workplace.

harassment prevention training soon.  This training is mandatory for all 
ENRON employees.

During this training you will:

 Be able to recognize harassment

 Learn to avoid being considered a harasser
 Know how to address a situation involving harassment

Enron is forming a new organization - - the Enron Xcelerator - - to drive the 
formation and development of new businesses at Enron.  Enron's unique ability 
to start and develop new businesses has driven most of our growth over the 
years.  Lou L. Pai, currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Energy Services, will 
lead the Xcelerator.  Over his years at Enron, Lou has been key to the 
creation and rapid growth of our wholesale gas, wholesale power and energy 
service businesses.  The existing business units will continue their 
development of core businesses, while the Xcelerator will be responsible for 
developing new business opportunities that are natural extensions of Enron's 
business model and core skills, but not currently under development elsewhere 
in Enron.

Dave Delainey, currently President and CEO of Enron Americas, will become 
Chairman and CEO of Enron Energy Services.  Dave brings a wealth of 
experience and accomplishment from Enron Wholesale Services' businesses where 
he led the growth of our Canadian business and our North American origination 
activity and, most recently, had a great year in Enron Americas.

Dave is forming an Office of the Chairman in EES.  Joining Dave in the Office 
of the Chairman are Dan Leff, President of EES, Global Energy Services, and 
Marty Sunde, President of EES, Global Marketing and Services.  Dan and Marty 
have been instrumental in the development and execution of the successful EES 
business model.  Also joining the Office of the Chairman of EES is Janet 
Dietrich as Chief Operating Officer.  Janet, currently is Managing Director 
in Enron Americas, where she has been successful in many of Enron Wholesale's 
core businesses, including gas trading, risk management and structural 
origination.  Tom White will continue as Vice Chairman of EES and will focus 
on the development and expansion of EES' customer relationships.  Lou, Tom, 
Dan, Marty and the entire EES organization have developed a great business 
model with great growth prospects.  EES has become an essential part of 
Enron's market valuation and growth story.  This new leadership structure 
will enable EES to continue on its path of sustained growth and increasing 
profitability.

John Lavorato will succeed Dave as President and CEO of Enron Americas.  John 
has been an essential part of Enron's energy trading success over the years 
and is a key part of Enron Wholesale Services' continuing success story.  
Joining John is Louise Kitchen, currently President and CEO of Enron 
NetWorks.  Louise, who accelerated Enron's outstanding growth with the 
deployment of EnronOnline, will take over as Chief Operating Officer of Enron 
Americas.

Philippe Bibi, currently Chief Operating Officer of Enron NetWorks will take 
over as President and CEO of Enron NetWorks.  Under Philippe's leadership, 
Enron has become a technology leader and the leading e-commerce company.  
Joining Philippe as Chief Operating Officer is Greg Piper, currently Managing 
Director of Enron NetWorks.  Greg currently leads Enron NetWork's origination 
activity and was responsible for the creation and deployment of ClickPaper, 
Enron's successful online pulp and paper marketplace.

Please join us in congratulating all of these individuals on their 
achievements and their new responsibilities.

Notice # 01-154
May 7, 2001

TO:
All NYMEX Division Members and Member Firms

FROM:
Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President

RE:
Implementation of New NYMEX Rule 9.11A ("Give-Up Trades")

DATE:
May 7, 2001
===========================================================
Please be advised that beginning on the trade date of Friday, June 1, 2001,
new NYMEX Rule 9.11A ("Give-Up Trades") will go into effect.

!    In the absence of an applicable give-up agreement, new Rule 9.11A will
define the respective responsibilities/obligations to an order of executing
brokers, customers and Clearing Members.

!    The term "executing broker" as used in Rule 9.11A refers to the
registered billing entity, Member Firm or Floor Broker to whom the order is
transmitted.

!    Rule 9.11 will provide that, in the absence of an applicable give-up
agreement, a Clearing Member may reject a trade only if: (1) the trade
exceeds trading limits established by the Clearing Member for that customer
that have been communicated to the executing broker as provided by the rule
or (2) the trade is an error for which the executing broker is responsible.

!    The new rule also places affirmative obligations on executing brokers
to confirm Clearing Member authorization for an account.  For example,
prior to an executing broker accepting and executing an initial order for
any new customer account, such executing broker must confirm with the
Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that:
(a)  the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member;
(b)  the account number;
(c)  the brokerage rate;
(d)  the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with
the executing broker for that account; and
(e)  a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that
account.
Moreover, the executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or
the specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite
party, date, time, and any other relevant information.  The Compliance
Department will conduct periodic audits of such records, and falsification
of such information shall be the basis for disciplinary action.


If you have any questions concerning this new rule, please contact Bernard
Purta, Senior Vice President, Regulatory Affairs and Operations, at (212)
299- 2380; Thomas LaSala, Vice President, NYMEX Compliance Department, at
(212) 299-2897; or Arthur McCoy, Vice President, Financial Surveillance
Section, NYMEX Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2928,

NEW RULE 9.11A ("Give-Up Trades")

(Entire rule is new.)

Rule 9.11A     Give-Up Trades

In the absence of a give-up agreement whose terms and conditions govern the
responsibilities/obligations of executing brokers, customers and Clearing
Members, the following rules shall define the respective
responsibilities/obligations of those parties to an order.  The "executing
broker", as used in this rule, is the registered billing entity, Member
Firm or Floor Broker to whom the order is transmitted.

(A)    Responsibilities/Obligations of Clearing Members

(1). Limits Placed by Clearing Member.   A Clearing Member may, in its
discretion, place trading limits on the trades it will accept for give-up
for a customer's account from an executing broker, provided however, that
the executing broker receives prior written or electronic notice from the
Clearing Member of the trading limits on that account.  Notice must be
received by the executing broker in a timely manner.  A copy of such notice
shall be retained by the Clearing Member.

(2). Trade Rejection.  A Clearing Member may reject ("DK") a trade only if:
(1) the trade exceeds the trading limits established under Section I(A) of
this rule for that customer and it has been communicated to the executing
broker as described in Subsection (A); or (2) the trade is an error for
which the executing broker is responsible.  If a Clearing Member has a
basis for rejecting a trade, and chooses to do so in accordance with the
provisions of Rule 2.21(B), it must notify the executing broker promptly.

(3). Billing.  A Clearing Member will pay all floor brokerage fees incurred
for all transactions executed by the executing broker for the customer and
subsequently accepted by the Clearing Member by means of the ATOM system.
Floor brokerage fees will be agreed upon in advance among the Clearing
Member, customer and the executing broker.

(B)  Responsibilities/Obligations of Executing Brokers

(1)  Customer Order Placement.  An executing broker will be responsible for
determining that all orders are placed or authorized by the customer.  Once
an order has been accepted, a broker or the broker's clerk must:

(a)  confirm the terms of the order with the customer;
(b)  accurately execute the order according to its terms;
(c)  confirm the execution of the order to the customer as soon as
practicable; and
(d)  transmit such executed order to the Clearing Member as soon as
practicable in accordance with Exchange Rules and procedures.

2.   Use of Other Persons.  Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the
executing broker is allowed to use the services of another broker in
connection with the broker's obligations under these rules.  The executing
broker remains responsible to the customer and Clearing Member under these
rules.

3.    Executing Broker Responsibility for Verifying Clearing Member
Authorization.  Prior to a broker accepting and executing an initial order
for any new customer account, the executing broker must confirm with the
Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that:
(f)  the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member;
(g)  the account number;
(h)  the brokerage rate;
(i)  the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with
the executing broker for that account; and
(j)  a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that
account.
The executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or the
specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite party,
date, time, and any other relevant information.  The falsification of such
information shall be the basis for disciplinary action.

4.   Rejection of Customer Order.  Where an executing broker has confirmed
Clearing Member authorization to execute orders on behalf of a customer in
accordance with this Rule 9.11A, the broker may, in the broker's
discretion, reject an order that the customer transmits to the broker for
execution.  The broker shall promptly notify the customer and the Clearing
Member(s) of any such rejection.

The following deals are being disputed by Reliant Energy Services. TAGG is 
showing these deals as Gas Daily, but the counterparty states that they 
should be changed to Nymex trades. They also stated that they were told by 
Mike Maggi that the deals would be changed to Nymex deals:

Torrey/Dawn -

Do you guys really think this is a reasonable reqeust.  Looks like there are 
in excess of 1500 deals.  If you guys need this field covered,  we need to 
come up with a better process than manually changing deals in TAGG.  Let me 
know how you would like to handle this or if we need to discuss further.  We 
will be happy to assist you any way we can,  short of manually going into 
1500 deals.

Thanks

Subject: EOL Broker Clean Up

Jeff,

I am attaching a list of EOL transactions that we need your help "cleaning 
up".  With the new Broker-Client application that EOL is bringing on this 
weekend, we need to remove EOL from the broker field.  What we have run into 
is:  there are many deals in Tagg that have EOL in the broker field but no 
EOL number.  We are requesting that risk go through and add the EOL deal 
number to the tagg legs where there is none listed.  The reason for this is 
that if we remove EOL from the broker field and there is no EOL deal number 
reference, then there is no way to no if that deal is an EOL deal.  For audit 
purposes, no one could tie back to the deals.  

Please give this list to the appropriate risk groups (by index).  Let me know 
if you have any further questions.  ALSO, this list is in addition to the 
list that I provided Errol yesterday.

Thank you,
Dawn

Please review the following file (the tab marked "2001 Summary") and help me 
answer the following questions for March:

1.  Two additional originations "corrections" of $379.50 each were granted to 
Mexico, but I don't think they belong to us.

2.  The $338,955 Vitro Corporativo Deal #QW8224 was not granted to Mexico, 
but my originator, Agustin Perez, says it should have been.  Please let me 
know if you are responsible for this deal.

I will be in Monterrey from Wednesday through Friday but will be checking my 
voicemails & e-mails periodically, so please feel free to contact me.

These deals were killed because we have terminated all deals with BP CAPITAL, 
T BOONE PICKENS, and PICKENS FUEL CORP.  Since there were so many deals we 
did not put comments in the deals.  However, deal tickets have been provided 
explicitely explaining what the Middle Market Group is doing w/ these

accomplish even greater things.

Because we believe that EBS is integral to Enron=01,s success, it is becomi=

corporate leadership and our Houston-based business units.   In short, we=

Joe Hirko as CEO and Ken Rice as Chief Commercial Officer have accomplished=

great things, and we believe that both are completely qualified to fill the=

CEO role moving forward.  However, Joe has decided to stay in Portland for=
=20
family reasons, and as a result, Ken will assume the role of CEO for EBS,=
=20
effective immediately. =20

Joe, unfortunately, has decided to leave Enron.  We want to recognize Joe f=

his role in making EBS a success.  He started the business, demonstrated it=

value to Enron management, and brought the team together to create the EBS=

vision.

We do believe that EBS will continue to grow and succeed under Ken=01,s=20
leadership.  Throughout his 19-year career with Enron, he has consistently=

been a driving force in building businesses.

Please join us in wishing both Joe and Ken great success.

Bob,

I have compiled three Excel files that value Pete Keavey's Gas Daily swaps 
and options.  In looking at the spreadsheet that you sent, I found these to 
be the most incorrectly valued.  In order to get the valuations, I had book 
administators run calculations in the ERMS system.  These values should 
correlate with how credit valued these deals.  Each file consists of a 
summary worksheet and a detail worksheet for each deal.  Please feel free to 
call, or have Homer call, with any questions that you have.




Thank you,

Errol McLaughlin, X5-8274

and
>
>B. J. Johnson as the starting wide receivers.
>Brown said sophomore Chris Simms probably will play, too, but he said
>Applewhite will be the starter.
>He also said Hodges Mitchell will continue to start at tailback, but said
he
>
>and sophomore Kenny Hayter will alternate.
>"When you play as poorly across the board as we did Saturday, you need to
>make some changes to try to improve what you are doing," he said.
>Brown said the team also showed a lot of spark in its first workout since
>the
>devastating loss to Oklahoma Saturday. "They have a lot of pride," he said,
>"
>and they are not pleased with the way they played in Dallas."
>The Longhorns might have four starting wide receivers because they worked a
>lot on the shotgun formation with four wideouts Tuesday. That has been the
>team's most productive formation because the Horns haven't been able to run
>the ball consistently and that formation gives the quarterbacks more time

>Brown also  said DT Shaun Rogers, who has missed the last two games with a

>With Williams and Johnson moving into the starting lineup, the Horns now

>Brown said he wanted to address the offensive changes Tuesday, and said he

>playing well all year, but it had a bad day against Oklahoma.
>* * * *
>Texas won its first four games against Colorado, but has lost six straight

>Texas has not played Colorado since Brown came to Texas.

>BUFFALO NOTES: Colorado coach Gary Barnett, noting the 63-14 whipping
