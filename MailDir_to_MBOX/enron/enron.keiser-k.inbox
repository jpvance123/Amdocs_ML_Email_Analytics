Kam,

Many of the SW curves have become obsolete since losing Enron's obscure deals.  Therefore, we would prefer to reduce our curves to the following:
	
	BASIS				INDEX				GDI-Index			PHYS			

	NGI-SoCal			NGI-SOCAL			GDP-CAL BORDER		NGI-SOCAL
	IF-ELPO/SJ			IF-ELPO/SJ			GDP-ELPO/SJ			IF-ELPO/SJ
					IF-ELPO/PERMIAN		GDP-ELPO/PERM		IF-ELPO/PERMIAN



Mike would like to kill Kingsgate in the NW.

Thanks

We have created six new curve files for UBS.  Could you please look at them and let me know if there is something in your files that you are not responsible for and we will move them.  Also, you can use these files to change or update your links.    O:\_dropbox\West Curves

We will probably be loading these on Wednesday for the first time to do our final testing so let me know if you have any questions or need our help with this. 

Can you let me know when you have finished with yours so we can convert them to the new database?

Thanks

Kam


If you have already done this let me know, Phillip is out all week and I don't know where he left off.

Give me a call if you have any questions.  I guess the next step is to clean up a few items on the attached spread sheet and then assign a value to each contract.  We need to come up with a plan for factoring in LDs with the MTM exposure.

While our established schedules of Tuesday and Friday DPR's would have us reporting tomorrow's activity on Monday, we will change that for month end.  Please email the January 31st DPR information for your respective groups to my attention by noon on Friday.  You should use the same spreadsheet format used for the 1/29/02 DPR.  All p&l and PRMA numbers should be in $'000's.  
 
Starting in February, you will be able to export the data, as opposed to using the spreadsheets.

John,

I checked the book list and there are 2 missing:

FB-CHICAGO
PB-CHICAGO

Please provide me the GCP ids.  Also you have 2 PB-WEST10 listed on your spreadsheet and please advise which id is the final.

I'll update the id on our side once I hear from you.

Thanks,

These are interbook deals and I need to confirm the following:

1. Which Bankruptcy book you want to move the deals to? BANKRUPTCY (166660) or BANKRUPTCY-CAD (166762)?
2. Change the counterparty of the deals associated with FT-CAND-TERMIN (166764) or FT-CAND-GONE-PR (166767) from NG-PRICE(11360), ENA-FT-WT-SOCAL(108201), ENA-WT-CAL(105544) to Bankruptcy (166660 or 166762)?
3. Should we should NGGJ as the commodity instead of NG?
4. Financial deals only
5. Cutoff date 1-jan-2002

The attached deal list are the deals behind those contracts, for those deals that are currently not included in the bankruptcy books. Please note that there are still several deals that I am trying to reconcile back to Sitara numbers. Assuming that I can do so, I will send supplemental information tomorrow afternoon.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any additional questions or concerns.

We have already created gas books for the top half of the list.  We now need to attach Gas Daily (I and Y risk types)to these books.  Also, we need to create gas books for the bottom half of the list, as well as, attach Gas Daily (I and Y risk types).

Thank you.

Kam,

Many of the SW curves have become obsolete since losing Enron's obscure deals.  Therefore, we would prefer to reduce our curves to the following:
	
	BASIS				INDEX				GDI-Index			PHYS			

	NGI-SoCal			NGI-SOCAL			GDP-CAL BORDER		NGI-SOCAL
	IF-ELPO/SJ			IF-ELPO/SJ			GDP-ELPO/SJ			IF-ELPO/SJ
					IF-ELPO/PERMIAN		GDP-ELPO/PERM		IF-ELPO/PERMIAN



Mike would like to kill Kingsgate in the NW.

Thanks

We have created six new curve files for UBS.  Could you please look at them and let me know if there is something in your files that you are not responsible for and we will move them.  Also, you can use these files to change or update your links.    O:\_dropbox\West Curves

We will probably be loading these on Wednesday for the first time to do our final testing so let me know if you have any questions or need our help with this. 

Can you let me know when you have finished with yours so we can convert them to the new database?

Thanks

Kam


If you have already done this let me know, Phillip is out all week and I don't know where he left off.

Jeff,

I have a concern regarding these new book requests for netco.  As you can see from the attached files, all the firm books have the same book code, "MF".  When accounting pulls the liquidations from TAGG, it is by book code and region.  When we pull the "MF" book code with "Financial" as the region, we will be getting the liquidations for John Arnold's book, Mike Maggi's book, etc.  We will have no way to determine which liquidations belong to which book.  I just have a concern that if/when we have variances we would not be able to determine which trader's book was the cause of the variance.  Do you know of another field that would provide this information?

thanks

Also, all physical weapon-X tabs are linking to an old east book.  I didn't touch that tab yet, we don't know if we're using weapon-X or sasqwatch.

Hey Gang,

Just a heads up, but you may need to edit your Copy Physical Macro in your P&L's that are saved in the Netco/Regions folder... The changes were simply renaming sheets in the Macro... O

Stacey:

The Gas Risk group is requesting that we preserve only a specified list of curves/pub codes for 
NetCo/UBS, and to delete the rest of the curves from TAGG/ERMS.

Please provide a list of Natural Gas curves/pub. codes that you would like to preserve in NetCo/UBS.

I am attaching the list of Natural Gas curves to preserve that Kam provided, for your reference:

 

Thanks,

The top half of the attached spreadsheet has already been set up.  However, we need to modify the previous request to include the additional two risk types mentioned below.  The bottom half of the list has yet to be set up.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Hey,

I keep hearing negative things about Lord of the Rings. Any desire to see In
the Bedroom. It's a thriller with Sissy Spacek. I've heard good things about
it. Or The Shipping News with Kevin Spacey. This is a drama. I think I'd
prefer the thriller myself.

In the Bedroom is playing at the Edwards near you at 1:30pm.

What do you think?

Debbie,

The credit committee needs to get some information from us that I could use your help with.  Can I get a dump of the non-terminated deals into excel and I will format it from there.  The information they need to see are the counterparty name, cash flows (MTM value) and positions.
As always, they need it by 11:00 this morning so if you could let me know if this is something your group could provide me with I would appreciate it. 

Thanks

Kam

TXU would like to close out all of their positions, and have finally provided us with their view of MTM and other charges for physical and financial power and gas for EPMI, ENA, EES and Enron Canada.  Would each of you please provide me with corresponding Enron numbers for your respective areas.  Michelle, as you will see, there is an item under ENA titled "other" - is this something from your area?  Elizabeth - given the net amount they owe us ($114,751,812.) if we can agree on numbers, can we take this as a one off item to the bankruptcy judge?  Please advise.  Thank you.

Carl,

Please review the attached.  I have attempted to summarize our mutual
exposures by legal entity.  If the numbers in the spreadsheet are negative,
then that is monies owed by TXU to Enron.

I am still waiting for exposure summaries from TXU Energy Services as it
applies to Garden State Paper.

As discussed today, my intent is to quickly reach agreement as to a fair
and reasonable resolution of eliminating Enron positions from our book
structure.  I feel confident that our combined legal staffs can bind our
intent as required.

THE ATTACHED SCHEDULES CONTAIN CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND IS SUBJECT TO
FEDERAL RULE OF EVIDENCE 408 - FOR SETTLEMENT DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY -
NOT TO BE OTHERWISE ADMISSIBLE

Please give me a call when you've had a chance to review.

thanks

We need to stop calling the UBS online trades EOL.  We also need to change the downstream systems - especially the auto confirms to something other than EOL for the transaction ID - or anything else.  I spoke to Dave Forster about this and he suggested we use OLT (on-line-trade) and OLT transaction number.   

Unfortunately the new website for trading does not have an exciting name (www.ubswenergy.com) - so unlike EnronOnline - it does not stand out.  

I realize it may take some time to change everywhere in all the systems it says "Enron" - but as you know, we definitely need to do it wherever the customers are involved.

I am being told by my better half that we need to get an accurate head
count of who will be attending our wedding.  If you would be so kind, could
you possibly let me know of your status over the next couple of days?  For
those of you who already sent us an RSVP response recently, please
disregard.

Thanks for your help!

Jeff

With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

Regan and Jane,

This note is written to request the migration of data contained in path O:common/Erms/erms_adm/Netco to the Netco/UBS environment before the testing period commencing February 4, 2002.  This folder contains models/tools used by the Risk Management group to support the trading activity in Natural Gas.  We have support from Zhiyong Wei and Hal McKinney in the conversion of the data to reflect the Netco/UBS environment, and we are now asking that the directory in whole be moved to the Netco/UBS environment. Please contact me at 3-9686 if there are questions or concerns with this request.

Jeff,

I have a concern regarding these new book requests for netco.  As you can see from the attached files, all the firm books have the same book code, "MF".  When accounting pulls the liquidations from TAGG, it is by book code and region.  When we pull the "MF" book code with "Financial" as the region, we will be getting the liquidations for John Arnold's book, Mike Maggi's book, etc.  We will have no way to determine which liquidations belong to which book.  I just have a concern that if/when we have variances we would not be able to determine which trader's book was the cause of the variance.  Do you know of another field that would provide this information?

thanks

In order to streamline getting users set up for access to the new environment supporting "Netco" (old EnronOnline applications),
we need to have the names and userids of your staff needing these applications.

In order to minimize processing several requests individually, we will use these lists to eliminate deletion of the names in the current database. This will save us from having to recreate them, which will save time on both sides. 

BUT, we need this information by 11AM tomorrow. Sorry for the late notice but IT has defined the deadline.

Thank you for your assistance.

Over the past few weeks, we've put together some rules for each group as to=
 whether or not they will be officializing, how frequently etc.  However, s=
ince the data I'm sending you today is the 12/31 data, many of these rules =
don't apply.  For the 12/31 data, we want to ensure we have correct VAR & c=
ounterparty data for SEC reporting, so for those of you that are not offici=
alizing due to lack of staff, we still need you to calc and officialize you=
r data for the 31st.

Over the next day or so, based on the below, I will be following up with ea=
ch of you to determine if there is any VAR or counterparty risk that was no=
t captured and then asking you to officialize the 12/31 books so we can pic=
k up the complete information for the 31st.  I will then put together a dea=
dline to get it done so I can rerun VAR.

Thanks for your cooperation.  If you have any questions or comments, please=
 call me at X39123.

Thanks,

Shona

Question for NetCo employees:
The new corp id's xfer to UBS is being considered for this Sunday.  Hence, no start menu access to estate.  You will still have access to NT estate drive data to copy.
Does anyone have the need to retain a estate id for support estate application during the last week?  Exceptions have to be authorized.
Wanted to get a preliminary need analysis...
 
This was sent by an IT manager, let me know your thoughts... O

We are trying to wrap up the year end reporting this week.  Please let me know if you are still having issues reporting and/or when to expect the year end data.  Some of you may not be familiar with the "export" process to get data to the Consolidated DPR.  If not, please call me and I can help.
 
David/Cindy- we will only be reporting the European numbers for the ECTRIC business.

In anticipation of the imminent closing of the UBSW Energy transaction, please have all outstanding employee expenses in your possession filed through Enron's XMS system as soon as possible.   Note to approvers - please approve these expense reports quickly.   Enron will process and pay all pre-closing expenses.   After transaction closing,  payments  for expenses submitted before closing (and put into Enron's XMS system) will be sent to your last known address or direct deposited into your account.

Enron has committed to processing and paying any expenses incurred prior to transaction closing.   If not completed this week, pre-closing expenses should be submitted on a  hard copy expense report form which will be available at  www.enron.com. 
		
There will be a series of e-mails coming out over the next few days highlighting the Travel & Entertainment policies of UBSW Energy and the procedures for processing and payment.   

If you have any questions, please contact Hope Vargas (3-5280) or Georganne Hodges (3-0430).

Hello Cora and Kam,
Kay says below in response to my e-mail below that the 2 deals shown should be PG&E Energy Trading - Gas Corporation.  If either of you can, please make the change in SITARA.  If someone else needs to do this, please let me know.
Thanks for the help.

Kay,

Please look at deals #1192611 & #1193243 for Jan 2002......should they be with PG&E Energy Trading - Gas Corporation?
Or is PG&E National Energy Group, Inc. correct?

Please advise.
Thanks,

Sanjeev,

I should have a list of post-id's for you by 4:30 today.  After friday, I will no longer have access to the estate, so if you could shoot this off over night so I could have something in the morning to work with I would appreciate it.

Let me know if that doesn't seem possible. 
Thanks

I know we have moved this meeting already, but since I have very little info ( only what I read on Yahoo!)
I think we should wait till next week to meet.  So I am going to cancel.

I have given Leslie, Jeff , Stacey and Rita,  Enron BUCKS cards.  Make them buy you a drink.

Let me know if you hear anything.

Thanks for you patients and continued understanding.

Following is a summary of the action items we discussed.  There were two items that came up after the meeting that I have added to this list (benchmark server and Frank's portfolio hierarchy draft).

 If I left anything out please respond back to everyone, thanks!

Day1 requirements - RisktRAC operations

1) User List 
Need to gather list of all employees that will be using risktRAC for book administration, verify list, then ensure they are setup in the RisktRAC database.
(related to 3) Security Access).

2) Migrate users to Netco
Need to check with network security and/or integration team to find out when the users IDs will be
converted to run on the Netco network.  (Dependency for running RisktRAC on Netco).

3) Security Access
Work with Stephanie to follow up with Security on approval for RisktRAC application: confirm groups and approvers.  	Ensure everyone who does not have RisktRAC will have an e-request submitted.

4) RisktRAC Training
Once users have access to Netco RisktRAC setup timeframe for basic training.  If time permits a hands-on overview could also be arranged, as long as someone can access the Netco RisktRAC from their desk (either user or developer).

5) Website connectivity: 
Distribute RAC website URL to Netco employees 
(confirmed with Bhupesh - http://rac.netco.enron.com )

6) Disable Spreadsheet Position loading: 
In RisktRAC disable the ability to load exotic spreadsheets for Day1 users.

7) Day1 Portfolio Hierarchy
(This step can occur before the books are loaded into RisktRAC.)

Review with Frank Hayden the ideal portfolio hierarchy that should be setup, then have users start building the structure without any associations to real portfolios.
The book-portfolio tie-in will occur with action item 8) Day1 Book-setup Spreadsheet.

8) Day1 Book-setup Spreadsheet
a) Discuss timeline for loading Day1 book data from the book-setup spreadsheet;
    Discuss validation issues and cutoff for loading data.
    Note expected book counts are 164 for Gas and approximately 55 - 60 for Power.

b) Add two columns in the spreadsheet for portfolio creation and hierarchy placement, have users fill in this data with guidance from IT.

9)  Control RisktRAC screen-access
Discuss necessary business groups and screen-access to setup in RisktRAC:  Gas Users, Power Users, Credit Users, Market-Risk Users, any other groups that come to mind.

10)  Book-creation/Portfolio audit:
Develop simple adhoc report to help audit books that are not associated with portfolios.  Discuss validation specifications with Ramesh.

11) Financial checks and balances:  
How can reported position/P&L numbers match up with those reported by accounting?  Need to find out who owns the accounting reporting and see if some adhoc verification can be implemented.


Known RisktRAC requirements beyond Day1

1) Desktop RisktRAC portfolio security 
Review how to implement portfolio-level security in the RisktRAC that is already present on the RAC website.

2) Benchmark Server:
Review with infrastructure how to migrate a copy of the Benchmark Server to a Netco server. 
Debbie and Ramesh to discuss further.

Can I get your help on the following request?  We need to find out what receivables/payables for financial and physical deals we have outstanding with the attached counterparties that we don't plan on settling.  

Can you please let me know if you are the right people to do this and how long it would take to get this information together?

Thanks

It would be total exposure, physical and financial, for gas, and then power separately, if you have access to that.  If not, forget power.  The date would be as of our bankruptcy, (Dec. 2nd?).  What did we owe them that we are not going to pay them?  What is our future exposure (MTM) as of now? (For a summer 2002 swap, for example.)  and what do they owe us if we haven't been paid?  We just need to be aware of how things ended with Enron so we can discuss it when we knock on their door as UBS.

Let me know what else you need and thanks for your help.

Are these physical or financial, or a combination.  Do you know the termination dates?  If not, I will try to get them from the confirmations group.

Kim, as part of the roll out plans we will need a summary report of the close out values for these customers.  Can you coordinate with credit, including the utilization of an analyst ( if you can find one). to complete this list.  

Cash means ( receivables, payables positions outstanding).
MTM ( the last MTM that we had with a company as we closed out).

The intent of compiling this information is to be able to position ourself for the appropriate conversation with this customer.... (if Enron owes them money, we should know that before we walk in the door). 



Pls review and let's discuss....

The first priority is the rolls supporting the DPR information.  Also, please remember that all information needs to be reconciled to DPR information.  Please let Chris, Keith & myself know of your time frame to get us this info.  Currently, expectations are that we should have at least the rolls by the end of the week this week.

Hey guys just thought I would let you know that Valero is going to be at
the Job Fair this Friday at Enron Field from 1-4 and I will be one of the
people attending it to represent us.  So if you are going to be there make
sure you come by and at least say hello.  Plus depending on when my flight
back is going to be and how soon I can leave the Fair we plan on going
somewhere and getting a couple of drinks.  So come by drop off a resume and
maybe we can get some drinks.

Note:  If you are interested in Valero there is a very good possibility
that the Director of Mid-Office will be attending as well and it would be a
good chance for an informal interview.

Hope everybody is doing alright and pass the word on to anybody I may have
missed.

Kyle

Subject: DPR reporting for 22nd trading due today - request by Fallon


Fallon has requested a DPR be prepared 2X a week for positions that we are executing on (active/live positions only, no terminations or deals we are not executing on).  We have put together the shell of how this DPR will look.  To start this process we are planning to present to him positions (column E) and PRM value (column X) as of 1/23.  To do this, we have laid out the following steps:
 
- we need to get the PRM values directly from you (column X)
- we will run the benchmarks and need to work with you to ensure you are happy with the benchmark numbers we have pulled from RMS (the exception is gas, we need the gas risk group to provide the gas bench to us)
- we need all of then exceptions/qualifications to your numbers
- we will need the other information in the schedule to be reported to us starting next week, but not for this exercise
 
Please confirm to me/Shona that you can get us this info by 230 pm today.
 
Lastly, I am attaching the unofficialized book list as these books will not make it into the benchmarks and need you to confirm that there are no 3rd party positions in these books.
 
Thanks in advance

Kam, Kathy and Brian,

Concerning the ECC - Riskmantra logic that EOL has in place to convert the transactions that are done with counterparties with ECC master agreements...are we going to continue this way of booking (2 legs)?  If so, can you review the list of counterparties that follows the "2-leg" logic and let me know if there need to be any additions or deletions?

Thanks,
Dawn

FYI - the west is wanting to split the region into two regions.  Stephen, I know you have been working on mapping the P&Ls for reporting purpose, the attached file breaks down those two regions.  We want to call then Southwest and Northwest.  They will be headed by Phillip Allen and Mike Grigsby respectively.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Cheryl,

The risk management group will be taking over the duties from the controls group as far as setting up new books.  I have attached five book requests that need to be set up for Netco.  Once these are set up can you please call me so I can tell Cecilia.  I will also need the Global ID # to give to EOL for their needs.


Thanks,

Kam

Jeff,

You are correct in that we do not have any type of daily reconciliation processes.  If they want to see the month end reconciliation of  the DPR to GL for one of the financial books I would contact Tracy Irvin x39158 and she can provide an example to them.  Let me know if you need more.

To all,  we are compiling a list of all common data ( documents, excel spreadsheets, etc...) contained on our O:drive and M:drive infrastructure that will be required for NetCo.  The assumption is that no transactional deal type data will be migrated. Please forward any directory names that will be required for Netco to me. For example,  O:\common\directoryname etc......If there are additional people or resources that I can coordinate with please let me know.  I am available to meet and assist in anyway possible.

Hello Randy & James,

Below are the forwarded instructions as to how we plan to update the excel dsn's for netco(UBSWenergy).  Only test excels in "_converted" folders, then create/move successful tests to a "_tested" folder (within the corresponding "_converted" folder).  

Call me if you have any prob/questions.

Subject:	Netco(UBSWenergy) Excel Conversions

Hello again,

We need to convert DSN references in more excel spreadsheets... this time to be used by NetCo(UBSWenergy).   The location of these files begins here: O:\erms\erms_adm\NetCo  including all sub-folders.  Convert excel files(.xls) only.  After you convert a spreadsheet move it to your current folder's "_Converted" folder.

Before you start, please run both the "ODBC DSN Entries for ERMT" and "ODBC DSN Entries for RMS" scripts.  These can be found by going thru the menus "Start", "Programs","System Utility Applications", then "Installation & Diskette Creation".  Afterwards you should see the new DSN's by running your windows "Data Sources (ODBC)" program and looking on the "System DSN" tab.  

Note that the DSN's using Oracle drivers now are followed by "-ora" and the DSN's without "-ora" were previously reserved for use with Microsoft (for oracle) drivers.

Remember, after opening an excel to convert, type [Alt]-[F11] to get to the VBA code.  Then type [Ctrl]-[F] and type "dsn" in the "Find What" field.  Make sure the "Search" selection is on "Current Project".  Keep pressing [Find Next] until you have addressed all dsn references.

The goal is to change all old dsn references to point to the new Netco(UBSWenergy) databases.  For example egsprod will become "ermtp-ora".   Do NOT put "est" in front of these dsn's because that will point to the old ESTate versions of the database!

ERMS Examples:

Example 1: This is the most common type of change.
Original: 
ODBCString = "ODBC;DSN=egsprod;UID=" & Sheet2.Range("UID") & ";PWD=" & Sheet2.Range("PW")
Should be changed to:
ODBCString = "ODBC;DSN=ermtp-ora;UID=" & Sheet2.Range("UID") & ";PWD=" & Sheet2.Range("PW")


Example 2:
Original 
ODBCstring = "ODBC;DSN=egsprod;DBQ=ermt;UID=" & Worksheets("Top Pages").Range("UID") & ";PWD=" & Worksheets("Top Pages").Range("PW")
Should be changed to:
ODBCstring = "ODBC;DSN=ermtp-ora;DBQ=ermtp;UID=" & Worksheets("Top Pages").Range("UID") & ";PWD=" & Worksheets("Top Pages").Range("PW")
(Note that IF their is a DBQ reference, it does NOT have "-ora" afterwards.  This s/b the actual oracle database name)




Example 3: In this example note that the DSN is referencing the variable "DBase" which points to cell B3 (see print-screen below)
ODBCString = "ODBC;DSN=" & DBase & ";UID=" & UserName & ";PWD=" & Password

Originally:
 

Should be changed to:
 



Example 4: RMS Example

Original:
   .Connection = "ODBC;DSN=New Rms Production;DBQ=tns:rmsprod_ded;UID=jdoe_pc;PWD=traderjoe;"""
Should be changed to:
  .Connection = "ODBC;DSN=rmsp-ora;DBQ=tns:rmsp;UID=jdoe_pc;PWD=traderjoe;"""
(Note that IF their is a DBQ reference, it does NOT have "-ora" afterwards.  This s/b the actual oracle database name)



There are 650+ excel files to convert so we really appreciate all of the help we can get.

Please call me if you have any questions.

Thanks, (very much!)

Please review the attached spreadsheet.  We need to change both the short name and long name on the Central CAD GCP ID's 166860, 166863, 166867, 166871, 166875, and 166877 to reflect that they are only GD books.  In addition, we also need to set up new GCP ID's for the FB-CENTX-CAD books to reflect that they are Price, Basis and Index.  Please call me to discuss if needed.  I will be out this afternoon, however, I will be checking my email as well as voice messages and returning calls.  My cell phone # is 713-628-9468.  Thanks.

Jeff Gossett told me that you are working on the new Estate book for performing deals.  We were wondering when this book would be finalized and when all the deals would be moved over into the new Performance book.  Could you just let me know when you think it will be finished.  Thanks for all your help.

Kam,

Could you please provide us with the calculations  and post IDs of the following books using the same criteria that you used for the Bankruptcy book:

	FT US CAN
	FT Canada
	FT Ontario (Canadian)
	FT Intra Ontario

I know that you may not run all these books, but could you help me find the applicable people so that we may obtain the same information that you provided to us on the Bankruptcy book.

Kam,
The data-base-id for all Canadian books has been changed to 'CANADA' from ERMS on the database.
We will also create the corresponding basis book-id for the Canada Price books in the Canada book mapping table.
Over the next week, I will talk with Zhi and get this setup so that once the entries are created in the ERMS tables, we will automatically update the same in RisktRAC.

Regards,
Ramesh

Can you specify which gas daily curve mappings.

We can probably load all of them up in excel.
You do your editing.
then we load it back into the database.

Question:

Once the new database for ERMS is split for Netco. we will have to make some changes to the gas daily curve mapping tables.  Is there another way to create these mappings other than adding them one at a time.  We are getting rid of a large percentage of curves and will be making many changes to the current mappings.  Doing it one by one will be very time consuming and I want to see if you are able to load them another way.

Hey,

So what's going?  What is the deal with the new company?  Are you guys
pretty much staying in the same place just now have a new name and some
liquidity.  I think I'm going to have to pass on the Vegas trip this year.
I really need to save money for the house and even though I'm passing on an
opportunity to make money, although that hasn't been the case my last 4
trips, I'm still going to have to pass.  Plus I might be going for another
bachelor party around the late Feb early March time frame anyway.

Yes Kyle Lilly is now working here.  His brother-in-law works here and I
think since they had there first child he was looking to get around more
family, neither his nor his wife's families live in Houston.  So anyway I
think we had been talking to him since the summer and it ended up being
pretty good timing since we didn't hire him until December.  The job is
alright.  The hours are starting to come back down and for the most part
everything is going good.  It seems like time of service has a lot to do
with moving up in this company and that is a little discouraging, but I
guess I will not worry about that too much.

Have you heard from Victor?  Has he found a job yet?

Well I hope you guys have fun and let me know how much money you win.

Hey,

Phillip already made reservations and Jeff is waiting to make sure he can
go.  Darren and his wife have made their plans, and Dawn and Gary have
also, I think.  I will next week, and a couple other girls from risk are
going too.  We're leaving on the 13th, returning the 16th.  Staying at the
Mirage.

You could win thousands in Vegas to use for your house.  What other
vacation can do that.

Well, we think we should hear something today as far as who we work for
now.  I'm sure it will be next week though.  We're assuming it will happen
and have been setting up all new files and databases.  It should be
interesting.

How is your job?  Does Kyle Lilly work for you now?

Later,
Kam

Maybe so, I'm guessing that is during Spring Break again?  Not too sure if
I really liked it with that many people out there, too many high dollar
tables.  Have you guys already made reservations?  Give me a little more
info but I kind have been saving for the house.  It should be ready around
late March or early April and I know I will have to buy a lot of stuff for
that, like a kegorator you know important things.

So what's the latest at Big E or I guess Little E now.  You think you guys
will go to the new joint venture or what ever happens to the trading
company when they sell it off?  Have you been looking?

Keep me in the loop.

Kyle

Hey guys just thought I would let you know that Valero is going to be at
the Job Fair this Friday at Enron Field from 1-4 and I will be one of the
people attending it to represent us.  So if you are going to be there make
sure you come by and at least say hello.  Plus depending on when my flight
back is going to be and how soon I can leave the Fair we plan on going
somewhere and getting a couple of drinks.  So come by drop off a resume and
maybe we can get some drinks.

Note:  If you are interested in Valero there is a very good possibility
that the Director of Mid-Office will be attending as well and it would be a
good chance for an informal interview.

Hope everybody is doing alright and pass the word on to anybody I may have
missed.

Kyle

Can I get your help on the following request?  We need to find out what receivables/payables for financial and physical deals we have outstanding with the attached counterparties that we don't plan on settling.  

Can you please let me know if you are the right people to do this and how long it would take to get this information together?

Thanks

It would be total exposure, physical and financial, for gas, and then power separately, if you have access to that.  If not, forget power.  The date would be as of our bankruptcy, (Dec. 2nd?).  What did we owe them that we are not going to pay them?  What is our future exposure (MTM) as of now? (For a summer 2002 swap, for example.)  and what do they owe us if we haven't been paid?  We just need to be aware of how things ended with Enron so we can discuss it when we knock on their door as UBS.

Let me know what else you need and thanks for your help.

Kim, as part of the roll out plans we will need a summary report of the close out values for these customers.  Can you coordinate with credit, including the utilization of an analyst ( if you can find one). to complete this list.  

Cash means ( receivables, payables positions outstanding).
MTM ( the last MTM that we had with a company as we closed out).

The intent of compiling this information is to be able to position ourself for the appropriate conversation with this customer.... (if Enron owes them money, we should know that before we walk in the door). 



Pls review and let's discuss....

Several groups have asked about the "11/30 to date" column on the DPR and what should be included in that number.  The intent was to report the p&l activity since Enron filed for bankruptcy, therefore including December p&l and January to date p&l, for the current DPR.  However, the question of whether we have the ability to include December's p&l is open.  The report should not include active deals which we do not intend to perform on, but those deals may not have been removed by the end of December from everyone's p&l.  
 
Please let me know if this is the case for your books.
 
Thanks,
Chris

To simplify the DPR reporting each Wednesday and Monday, please use the attached spreadsheet to populate and return via email.  This is a temporary solution and I will be working to set up a new export process the streamline reporting.  I would appreciate it if the spreadsheets were emailed priro to noon each Wednesday and Monday.  The main info to include are the positions, p&l and PRMA.
 
Please remember to include only the information related to active deals that we anticipate fulfilling.  If there are any pieces that should be captured, and for whatever reason you are not able to at this time, please note that as a caveat at the bottom of the spreadsheet.

Haven't heard back from you all regarding the Canadian P/B/I books for Central.  We need to set these up asap in Netco database for testing.  John, have you got the request from Kam or Phillip on this?  If so, would you email me the request together with the CP IDs in Global?  If not, please send John the book request (book code cannot be MC, please assign something else).

Call me if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Cecilia

The West books should be GD and GDY for Canadian deals.  I would think that the central books should have two set up, one for P/B/I and one for GD.  I believe I had called you and said that the books should be set up like FT-ONT-GDL for the gas daily books.  This is correct.  Thanks.

Phillip/Kam,

The following new Canadian gas books are all assigned to "MC" but a canadian book can either be price/basis/index or gasdaily but it cannot be both (otherwise cause problems in PortCalc).  I remember we discussed about this last time and I was told to use FT-ONTARIO as the example, but there are a lot of FT-ONTARIO books like FT-ONT-CENTRAL and FT-ONT-GDL with different setup.  

For example, 166860 has all P/B/Idx/GD checked which it shouldn't be.  And 166859 has GD checked so does it mean it should be set up as a Canadian gasdaily book?  Then if 166860 - 166877 are Canadian price/basis/index, another book code should be assigned instead of using MC.  Please advise.


CP ID	Short Name	Code	Region	Commodity	Uom	Currency	Commodity/UOM/Curr	P	B	Idx	GD	PHY	Y

Also as per our conversation with Kam, all PB-HDG books set up from the original list have been removed from the database as they were not supposed to be set up in Tagg/Erms.

Kam -

Can you get a list of all curves together for 11/30.  And any sample broker quotes that we may have.  ( I hope we are saving them at this point.)

Kam:

The Financial desk also requested 3 books for WTI, HU and HO - do we need to preserve these curves in NetCo/UBS also?
If so, we would need the curve codes/pub. codes.

Thanks,
Jeremy

Jeremy,

Please make appropriate changes to the NETCO ERMS database for the following requests. What needs to be done is to delete all other curve entries in the egs_curve_def and egs_curve points and egs_pub_names which are not listed in the attached file. I will talk to you about it.

Thanks

 Zhiyong,

We have decided to take the curve history with us to UBS for the attached curves.  We have changed the names for some of the curves so column J has additional curves that we would like to bring history.  We will not continue publishing those in the future however.


Thanks

Kam

Subject:	Netco(UBSWenergy) Excel Conversions

Hello again,

We need to convert DSN references in more excel spreadsheets... this time to be used by NetCo(UBSWenergy).   The location of these files begins here: O:\erms\erms_adm\NetCo  including all sub-folders.  Convert excel files(.xls) only.  After you convert a spreadsheet move it to your current folder's "_Converted" folder.

Before you start, please run both the "ODBC DSN Entries for ERMT" and "ODBC DSN Entries for RMS" scripts.  These can be found by going thru the menus "Start", "Programs","System Utility Applications", then "Installation & Diskette Creation".  Afterwards you should see the new DSN's by running your windows "Data Sources (ODBC)" program and looking on the "System DSN" tab.  

Note that the DSN's using Oracle drivers now are followed by "-ora" and the DSN's without "-ora" were previously reserved for use with Microsoft (for oracle) drivers.

Remember, after opening an excel to convert, type [Alt]-[F11] to get to the VBA code.  Then type [Ctrl]-[F] and type "dsn" in the "Find What" field.  Make sure the "Search" selection is on "Current Project".  Keep pressing [Find Next] until you have addressed all dsn references.

The goal is to change all old dsn references to point to the new Netco(UBSWenergy) databases.  For example egsprod will become "ermtp-ora".   Do NOT put "est" in front of these dsn's because that will point to the old ESTate versions of the database!

ERMS Examples:

Example 1: This is the most common type of change.
Original: 
ODBCString = "ODBC;DSN=egsprod;UID=" & Sheet2.Range("UID") & ";PWD=" & Sheet2.Range("PW")
Should be changed to:
ODBCString = "ODBC;DSN=ermtp-ora;UID=" & Sheet2.Range("UID") & ";PWD=" & Sheet2.Range("PW")


Example 2:
Original 
ODBCstring = "ODBC;DSN=egsprod;DBQ=ermt;UID=" & Worksheets("Top Pages").Range("UID") & ";PWD=" & Worksheets("Top Pages").Range("PW")
Should be changed to:
ODBCstring = "ODBC;DSN=ermtp-ora;DBQ=ermtp;UID=" & Worksheets("Top Pages").Range("UID") & ";PWD=" & Worksheets("Top Pages").Range("PW")
(Note that IF their is a DBQ reference, it does NOT have "-ora" afterwards.  This s/b the actual oracle database name)




Example 3: In this example note that the DSN is referencing the variable "DBase" which points to cell B3 (see print-screen below)
ODBCString = "ODBC;DSN=" & DBase & ";UID=" & UserName & ";PWD=" & Password

Originally:
 

Should be changed to:
 



Example 4: RMS Example

Original:
   .Connection = "ODBC;DSN=New Rms Production;DBQ=tns:rmsprod_ded;UID=jdoe_pc;PWD=traderjoe;"""
Should be changed to:
  .Connection = "ODBC;DSN=rmsp-ora;DBQ=tns:rmsp;UID=jdoe_pc;PWD=traderjoe;"""
(Note that IF their is a DBQ reference, it does NOT have "-ora" afterwards.  This s/b the actual oracle database name)



There are 650+ excel files to convert so we really appreciate all of the help we can get.

Please call me if you have any questions.

Thanks, (very much!)

1. move to the appropriate book based on the logic - Canadian deal needs to go to CAD
2. should only have to change deals from NG-Price to bankruptcy (deals are not in any other book)
3. The Canadian logic deals will probably be in GJ and the US logic should be in NG
4. Financial only
5. Cutoff date 1/1/2002

These are interbook deals and I need to confirm the following:

1. Which Bankruptcy book you want to move the deals to? BANKRUPTCY (166660) or BANKRUPTCY-CAD (166762)?
2. Change the counterparty of the deals associated with FT-CAND-TERMIN (166764) or FT-CAND-GONE-PR (166767) from NG-PRICE(11360), ENA-FT-WT-SOCAL(108201), ENA-WT-CAL(105544) to Bankruptcy (166660 or 166762)?
3. Should we should NGGJ as the commodity instead of NG?
4. Financial deals only
5. Cutoff date 1-jan-2002

Kam, John, we found a few book_id name issues while trying to batch-load the books.

We were able to figure out the issues ourselves, but for your reference here are the changes we made:


FB-EXECUTIVE	M	F	P	FIN	US FINANCIAL                  	ERMS	emglaugh	
FB-EXECUTIVE	M	F	D	FIN	US FINANCIAL                  	ERMS	emglaugh	
FB-EXECUTIVE	M	F	I	FIN	US FINANCIAL                  	ERMS	emglaugh	
FB-EXECUTIVE	M	F	M	FIN	US FINANCIAL                  	ERMS	emglaugh	
FB-EXECUTIVE	M	F	Y	FIN	US FINANCIAL                  	ERMS	emglaugh	

Note all 5 books were labeled as 'FB-EXECUTIVE'.  We instead named them

FB-EXECUTIVE-PRC
FB-EXECUTIVE-BAS
FB-EXECUTIVE-IDX
FB-EXECUTIVE-GDM
FB-EXECUTIVE-GDY

Also, we found these two books that had the same book ID:

FB-WEST1-GDM	M	F	M	WEST1	US GAS WEST	ERMS	plove	

FB-WEST1-GDM	M	F	M	WEST10	US GAS WEST	ERMS	plove	

Note that the second book should be named 'FB-WEST10-GDM', based on the WEST10 Region Code.

We fixed that one as well.

Please update your spreadsheet, and let us know if we need to discuss in the morning.

The next step is the hierarchy, which we should receive from Stephanie or Debbie in the morning.  Thanks.

Andrew

Hey guys,

Each book should have been split into 3 books - 

- terminated by the counterparty
- ongoing transactions (active) and
- transactions that have not yet been terminated by a counterparty but that we are not going to fullfil.

The DPR should only have the active transactions in it. Hope that clarifies!

Hey, John.  I found out today that early next week (perhaps Monday or Tuesday) will be the time that we can get risktRAC running on your group's desktops.

They plan to migrate the user IDs for all Netco users over the weekend.  So this means by next Monday afternoon or Tuesday morning you should be able to run the Netco version of RisktRAC.

My group will be moved over to the new building by Monday, and once we are operational, we can be there to start training on RisktRAC.

I'll check with Ramesh and see if we can send out an update message to your entire group, thanks.

Bill,

We really do not need to delete the books.  We would like to keep them available for possible future trading.  Essentially, additional books are set up for the sole purpose of using them in the future when needed.  At that time, we will assign a trader name to the book.  This will mean that the book is ready to go in GCP as well as ERMS.  Let me know if you have any questions.

John

I forwarded Jon the color coded list I sent to you.  He said that some of the Traders and or Book names would be changed, some Books would be deleted all together.

Talk to you later.

Bill-

Kevin Presto gave us a revised list of the traders and their books.  I would say about 50% of what has been set up has changed.  Due to the large number of changes, would it be best to delete what we have created and start over, or should we send you a revised list and just make those changes?  Please let us know what you would like us to do.  

Thank you.

J.P.

I am attaching the application that you can use to grant access to the books in your regions.
I currently granted access to each of you for access to everything.
This application should be saved to your own drive.  It is also currently under O:/dropbox/TDS


 

Any questions or problems, give me a call.

Kam, 

Ramesh said it was fine to add these three trading locations to the list.

The enrties will have to be inserted into the range in the "Field Constraints" spreadsheet tab.
I think the dropdowns will automatically update.

If not, please let me know, I can modify the sheet and send out a new version.  Thanks!

Jeremy,

Please make appropriate changes to the NETCO ERMS database for the following requests. What needs to be done is to delete all other curve entries in the egs_curve_def and egs_curve points and egs_pub_names which are not listed in the attached file. I will talk to you about it.

Thanks

 Zhiyong,

We have decided to take the curve history with us to UBS for the attached curves.  We have changed the names for some of the curves so column J has additional curves that we would like to bring history.  We will not continue publishing those in the future however.


Thanks

Kam

Please let Chris, Keith & myself know of your time frame to get us this info.  Currently, expectations are that we should have at least the rolls by the end of the week this week.

Then who is my strongest person? I do not know anything about Kristen. I prefer at least one aggressive person on the desk, Monte and Ashley are kind of shy.

Scott,  

I really think that Melissa would be able to handle Storey better than Kristen.  I think we should keep her on Central and let you take Kristen on the East.

Are you ok with that?

We have just decided to divide the western region into two groups.  I will be heading up the Rockies/NW and Northern California, while Phillip Allen heads up the Southwest and Southern California.  Think about whether or not you  would like to change how you serve our groups going forward.  We will need to divide the curve files to reflect the separate regions.  The Southwest will be defined as EP SJ and EP Permian.  P&L summary reports will be separated into two groups.

Yes, lets try to inform the same group on my E-Mail, also, I will find the status of the status of the Address Roles associated with Traders.  I will pull a report detailing all the Books that has been setup todate.  Just a reminder, we will continue to set the NETCO Group Link on all Books/DESKS/PORT FOLIOS and with the Canadian also add the NETCO Canadian.  We will try to further sub down to NETCO Canadian Power etc, this should help in the future.

Give me a call if you have any questions.  I guess the next step is to clean up a few items on the attached spread sheet and then assign a value to each contract.  We need to come up with a plan for factoring in LDs with the MTM exposure.

Here is an updated version of the template, it should be easier to use as you have all split out your books into 3 (terminated by the counterparty, not being fulfilled, and active).  Again, this should be as of positions held today.  Based on my discussions with you so far, it looks like this is doable by the end of next week.

Please call me if you have questions.

Best regards

All counterparties with Master Agreements with ECC that hit a US product must be booked as two legs:  leg one booked between ECC and the counterparty with risk assignment of FT-US/CAND-ERMS; leg two flipping the position out of FT-US/CAND-ERMS to the appropriate risk book (the book on the online product).  This applies only to finanical swaps and not physical deals.

Please let me know if there is going to be a change and if so what the deals should look like in Tagg.  The programmers need time to modify logic and I need time to test!

Thanks for your help.

We have already created gas books for the top half of the list.  We now need to attach Gas Daily (I and Y risk types)to these books.  Also, we need to create gas books for the bottom half of the list, as well as, attach Gas Daily (I and Y risk types).

Thank you.

We have a "bug" in Sitara when multiple global counterparty rows (Sitara portfolios and Tagg books) have the same COUNTERPARTY_LEGAL_NM.
We are currently not doing any code enhancement.
Until we get over this hump, we would appreciate your assistance in ensuring that duplicat names are avoided.

Melba and I tested 4 more deals today..2 power and 2 gas.  I am attaching the transaction summary for your review.  Again, we are using the Dynegy counterparty name for testing purposes  Please verify that everything is flowing correctly to the downstream systems.

O'Neal, I will be getting with you tomorrow or Friday about how these look in Tagg and Sitara.  Also, the 11 deals that I tested yesterday, I will need you to check them out as well.  Thanks for your help.

The West books should be GD and GDY for Canadian deals.  I would think that the central books should have two set up, one for P/B/I and one for GD.  I believe I had called you and said that the books should be set up like FT-ONT-GDL for the gas daily books.  This is correct.  Thanks.

Phillip/Kam,

The following new Canadian gas books are all assigned to "MC" but a canadian book can either be price/basis/index or gasdaily but it cannot be both (otherwise cause problems in PortCalc).  I remember we discussed about this last time and I was told to use FT-ONTARIO as the example, but there are a lot of FT-ONTARIO books like FT-ONT-CENTRAL and FT-ONT-GDL with different setup.  

For example, 166860 has all P/B/Idx/GD checked which it shouldn't be.  And 166859 has GD checked so does it mean it should be set up as a Canadian gasdaily book?  Then if 166860 - 166877 are Canadian price/basis/index, another book code should be assigned instead of using MC.  Please advise.

Maybe so, I'm guessing that is during Spring Break again?  Not too sure if
I really liked it with that many people out there, too many high dollar
tables.  Have you guys already made reservations?  Give me a little more
info but I kind have been saving for the house.  It should be ready around
late March or early April and I know I will have to buy a lot of stuff for
that, like a kegorator you know important things.

So what's the latest at Big E or I guess Little E now.  You think you guys
will go to the new joint venture or what ever happens to the trading
company when they sell it off?  Have you been looking?

Keep me in the loop.

Subject: Valero at Enron Job Fair on Friday


Hey guys just thought I would let you know that Valero is going to be at
the Job Fair this Friday at Enron Field from 1-4 and I will be one of the
people attending it to represent us.  So if you are going to be there make
sure you come by and at least say hello.  Plus depending on when my flight
back is going to be and how soon I can leave the Fair we plan on going
somewhere and getting a couple of drinks.  So come by drop off a resume and
maybe we can get some drinks.

Note:  If you are interested in Valero there is a very good possibility
that the Director of Mid-Office will be attending as well and it would be a
good chance for an informal interview.

Hope everybody is doing alright and pass the word on to anybody I may have
missed.

Kyle

Kim, as part of the roll out plans we will need a summary report of the close out values for these customers.  Can you coordinate with credit, including the utilization of an analyst ( if you can find one). to complete this list.  

Cash means ( receivables, payables positions outstanding).
MTM ( the last MTM that we had with a company as we closed out).

The intent of compiling this information is to be able to position ourself for the appropriate conversation with this customer.... ( if Enron owes them money, we should know that before we walk in the door). 



Pls review and let's discuss....

Kam,

I need your help on something.   I am trying to compile a listing of all reports that were being run by the Risk leads and Specialist on a daily basis for the estate.  If you could please give me a general idea of the daily reports that you know of, I would greatly appreciate it.  I am doing this to ensure that we don't skip  or miss anything that was being done on a day to day basis for the estate.  I will take what info you give me and forward it on to Greg Couch so that he will be aware of all reports that needs to be ran daily.  

Thanks
Luchas

Please take a look at these and have who ever is going to set each of them establish any needed links. They can save them out to the same directory. Risk needs this done by Wednesday afternoon. Thanks.

I just want to verify the regional leads as they will be the eRequest security access approvers for Sitara and TDS.

Cecilia,
In addition to moving the deals detailed in my previous email, please move only financial deals with the same counterparties from NG-PR-OPT to ENA-WT-SOCAL.  I realize it's a big list, but how long will the entire process take?  If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks.

Sounds good. I was thinking the same about a template in excel for a interim fix. Maybe one of the assistants knows who we would order the old tickets from. We could design new tickets with the duplicate feature they had. If an internal company (ie: The Image Center) produced them, we may have to go to a outside printer. Anyway, this is by no means urgent, but I believe it will eventually be a necessary cost of business.

Good question,

I think we should have an excel template set up with all imaginable necessary info that all traders should use, one line per trade rather than one sheet per trade.  What do you think?

Attached are the original spreadsheets with additional book requests in yellow.  This should be the end, or close to it, for the Netco gas book requests.  As before, could I get the global id's once you are finished? 


Thanks,

Also, all physical weapon-X tabs are linking to an old east book.  I didn't touch that tab yet, we don't know if we're using weapon-X or sasqwatch.

Hey Gang,

Just a heads up, but you may need to edit your Copy Physical Macro in your P&L's that are saved in the Netco/Regions folder... The changes were simply renaming sheets in the Macro... O

Here is the status of form a without intercompanies.  To date, I have only received Pwr (US & CA), US gas, & liquids.  Can the rest of you let me know when I should expect to receive the info (the schedule itself + the reconciliation to the 11/30 DPR)?  I would like to send out all of the schedules by the end of this week.  Will it be possible for you to meet that deadline?  For those of you who provided me with the info in a different format, I need you to fill in the E&Y doc as we need them all standardized to goto the credit committee.

 

Status of form A

Kam,

I was just talking to Barry about this and he is saying that the MTM for future deals should be dated the 2nd as well.  Basically, as of the date the contracts terminated, which most were that day (or monday the 3rd).  Sorry.  Let me know if you have any quesitons.

It would be total exposure, physical and financial, for gas, and then power separately, if you have access to that.  If not, forget power.  The date would be as of our bankruptcy, (Dec. 2nd?).  What did we owe them that we are not going to pay them?  What is our future exposure (MTM) as of now? (For a summer 2002 swap, for example.)  and what do they owe us if we haven't been paid?  We just need to be aware of how things ended with Enron so we can discuss it when we knock on their door as UBS.

Let me know what else you need and thanks for your help.

Kim, as part of the roll out plans we will need a summary report of the close out values for these customers.  Can you coordinate with credit, including the utilization of an analyst ( if you can find one). to complete this list.  

Cash means ( receivables, payables positions outstanding).
MTM ( the last MTM that we had with a company as we closed out).

The intent of compiling this information is to be able to position ourself for the appropriate conversation with this customer.... (if Enron owes them money, we should know that before we walk in the door). 



Pls review and let's discuss....

I am following up to see where we stand on the risk books for December.  My understanding is that we will have at least 3 categories:  legally terminated, not performing but not terminated, and still performing.

The deals that are still performing should have liquidations, etc. "as normal" - the remainder will be "frozen" until an amount is settled with the counterparty.

I am inheriting the MTM group and am trying to get as much done before we split with the people going to NETCO, so if you can give me the status and ETA if the books are not done I would greatly appreciate it.

thanks
Lisa

Regan and Jane,

This note is written to request the migration of data contained in path O:common/Erms/erms_adm/Netco to the Netco/UBS environment before the testing period commencing February 4, 2002.  This folder contains models/tools used by the Risk Management group to support the trading activity in Natural Gas.  We have support from Zhiyong Wei and Hal McKinney in the conversion of the data to reflect the Netco/UBS environment, and we are now asking that the directory in whole be moved to the Netco/UBS environment. Please contact me at 3-9686 if there are questions or concerns with this request.

Kam,

As we discussed this morning, the traders will be using their physical books to log onto EOL with the exception of the financial desk (John Arnold and team).  Behind the scenes, EOL will  set these traders up in the Counterparty Alternates table to have the books "flip" to the respective financial book when a financial trade is hit.  

Also, any word yet on the traders wanting a different book for price, basis and index.  We are still under the assumption that the trades will book under one book.

Please let me know if you have any further questions.

Thanks,
Dawn

The following guidelines should be followed in determining the kind of application data and databases that should be migrated to UBS.

1. As a general rule, all Enron data relating to or used in connection with the trading of North American Gas and Power (Netco's commodities) should be copied and the copy transferred to Netco.  This includes forward curves created in the past and data on commodities that are relevant to the pricing of Netco's commodities (i.e., coal and oil).  Data on other commodities should not be copied or transferred for Netco.  In all cases, a complete copy of the data transferred to Netco must be retained by Enron.

2. There are three important exceptions to the general rule:

a. With respect to trading counterparties, only contact information and Enron created trading profiles may be transferred to Netco.  All other information concerning a trading counterparty, including credit information, historical trading data and terms of trading contracts with Enron, may not be transferred without the express written consent of the trading counterparty and the approval of the legal department.

b. With respect to other third parties that have entered into written agreements with Enron, such as brokers, software vendors and market data vendors, only contact information may be transferred to Netco.  All other information, including pricing, concerning the contractual relationship between Enron and the third party may not be transferred without the approval of the legal department.  In many cases there are confidentiality provisions in these agreements requiring the consent of the third party prior to the disclosure of confidential information.

c. Historical data provided to Enron by a third party data source may not be transferred to Netco without the approval of the legal department.  In many cases, the contracts governing the data preclude its copying and transfer.

If you have any questions concerning these guidelines, please contact Regan Smith at x39291.

Hi, Sweethearts,
 
I want to let you know that Michael's father passed away yesterday  morning. He had been feeling bad for about a month and last week he passed out and hurt himself. At the hospital they found out that he had a bleeding ulcer that made him faint. They took had to take him off the blood thinners and they were giving him medication for the ulcer and sent him home Tuesday night. Wednesday morning he must have had a blood clot that caused a heart attack. Crystal and Jamie did cpr which started his heart again but then it stopped. 
 
Michael is in Denver and is going to Alamo tonight for the funeral on Saturday. The kids and I aren't going since Michael has to leave for Denver and then North Dakota on Sunday and he doesn't want me trying to drive out there alone with the kids. Michael was training on Wednesday so I waited to tell him until lunch. He is blessed that two of his good friends were there and they have helped him deal with his loss (one of them is exactly Michael's age and is dying of lymphoma...he has 5 children, the youngest just 7).
 
Michael seems to be doing fine, although the funeral will be hard. His family will be in a financial crisis, though. Please pray with us for them that God helps them through their pain and hard decisions.
 
Mandi, I hope your move goes without problems. 
 
I love you all,
 
Mom

Anne,

For Nov. 2001, ENA billed Northwest Natural Gas for demand charges on deal # 992523 and deal # 967236. The total amount for each deal was $127,500.00 (300,000 @ $.425). The customer paid for only one of the deals. Do you know if both deals are valid and the customer is responsible for paying both? (Note: the comments on deal # 967236 state - seller's choice, if gas is delivered @ Caly Basin use # 992523.) Please advise.

Thanks,

Kim, as part of the roll out plans we will need a summary report of the close out values for these customers.  Can you coordinate with credit, including the utilization of an analyst ( if you can find one). to complete this list.  

Cash means ( receivables, payables positions outstanding).
MTM ( the last MTM that we had with a company as we closed out).

The intent of compiling this information is to be able to position ourself for the appropriate conversation with this customer.... ( if Enron owes them money, we should know that before we walk in the door). 



Pls review and let's discuss....

These are the official post-id's from Dec 31st for all live deals. We didn't have a "performance" book until January.   I included Canada and EMW at the bottom if needed.

I am following up to see where we stand on the risk books for December.  My understanding is that we will have at least 3 categories:  legally terminated, not performing but not terminated, and still performing.

The deals that are still performing should have liquidations, etc. "as normal" - the remainder will be "frozen" until an amount is settled with the counterparty.

I am inheriting the MTM group and am trying to get as much done before we split with the people going to NETCO, so if you can give me the status and ETA if the books are not done I would greatly appreciate it.

thanks
Lisa

Any thing that is not terminated per legal.

I am sure they will want them split between in the money and out of the money.

So think about how we get there.

Hey guys,

Each book should have been split into 3 books - 

- terminated by the counterparty
- ongoing transactions (active) and
- transactions that have not yet been terminated by a counterparty but that we are not going to fullfil.

The DPR should only have the active transactions in it. Hope that clarifies!

However, DSN like egsprod and ermt will be invalid. In other words, we want to eliminate any chance of database cross-referrence. So, I think we do need to change the spreadsheets that have DSN such as egsprod and ermt in the code.

It would be total exposure, physical and financial, for gas, and then power separately, if you have access to that.  If not, forget power.  The date would be as of our bankruptcy, (Dec. 2nd?).  What did we owe them that we are not going to pay them?  What is our future exposure (MTM) as of now? (For a summer 2002 swap, for example.)  and what do they owe us if we haven't been paid?  We just need to be aware of how things ended with Enron so we can discuss it when we knock on their door as UBS.

Let me know what else you need and thanks for your help.

Kim, as part of the roll out plans we will need a summary report of the close out values for these customers.  Can you coordinate with credit, including the utilization of an analyst ( if you can find one). to complete this list.  

Cash means ( receivables, payables positions outstanding).
MTM ( the last MTM that we had with a company as we closed out).

The intent of compiling this information is to be able to position ourself for the appropriate conversation with this customer.... (if Enron owes them money, we should know that before we walk in the door). 



Pls review and let's discuss....

Can you do the same thing with a different book id?  Instead of book counterparty FT-CAND-TERMIN, move any deals with the FT-TERMIN-GD book to the bankruptcy book from NG-Price.  Financial deals only.  Thanks.  Let me know if you need any further clarification, should be the exact same script as yesterday, just substitute FT_TERMIN-GD for the two books you were looking for yesterday.

1. move to the appropriate book based on the logic - Canadian deal needs to go to CAD
2. should only have to change deals from NG-Price to bankruptcy (deals are not in any other book)

These are interbook deals and I need to confirm the following:

1. Which Bankruptcy book you want to move the deals to? BANKRUPTCY (166660) or BANKRUPTCY-CAD (166762)?
2. Change the counterparty of the deals associated with FT-CAND-TERMIN (166764) or FT-CAND-GONE-PR (166767) from NG-PRICE(11360), ENA-FT-WT-SOCAL(108201), ENA-WT-CAL(105544) to Bankruptcy (166660 or 166762)?
3. Should we should NGGJ as the commodity instead of NG?

Is Kelly doing structuring over there or is it a risk job? Any details on the weather guy(s) walkout?  Sounds like a good opportunity but why did they all leave?  I wonder if they're starting up their own consulting company? I have a few things presently in the works. I'm hoping to touch base with Scott N. sometime today. Too bad I couldn't make a living by being a frequent job switcher.  I could be good at that.  Things would be a hell of a lot easier if I was willing to take a job out of state.  Lots available elsewhere..

See ya,

JR

Scott Neal has been trying to get a hold of me.  UBS is looking for some weather guys because a bunch of weather people left there.  Now wouldn't that be funny if I ended up back there in a different capacity?

Can you do the same thing with a different book id?  Instead of book counterparty FT-CAND-TERMIN, move any deals with the FT-TERMIN-GD book to the bankruptcy book from NG-Price.  Financial deals only.  Thanks.  Let me know if you need any further clarification, should be the exact same script as yesterday, just substitute FT_TERMIN-GD for the two books you were looking for yesterday.

1. move to the appropriate book based on the logic - Canadian deal needs to go to CAD
2. should only have to change deals from NG-Price to bankruptcy (deals are not in any other book)
3. The Canadian logic deals will probably be in GJ and the US logic should be in NG
4. Financial only
5. Cutoff date 1/1/2002

These are interbook deals and I need to confirm the following:

1. Which Bankruptcy book you want to move the deals to? BANKRUPTCY (166660) or BANKRUPTCY-CAD (166762)?
2. Change the counterparty of the deals associated with FT-CAND-TERMIN (166764) or FT-CAND-GONE-PR (166767) from NG-PRICE(11360), ENA-FT-WT-SOCAL(108201), ENA-WT-CAL(105544) to Bankruptcy (166660 or 166762)?
3. Should we should NGGJ as the commodity instead of NG?
4. Financial deals only
5. Cutoff date 1-jan-2002

Can we delete the Chicago books from Global Counterparties.  We will not be using these books at all.  Let me know if this would be possible.  The GCP id's are 166896, 167105, and 166898.  Thanks.

Dear Kam,

The Oracle Power database has been moved. The Excel Applications which are involved with the database need to be modified. So does your PCs' setting.

Please let us know when we can go to your desk for the changes. The time only need < 20 minutes.

Following is a summary of the action items we discussed.  There were two items that came up after the meeting that I have added to this list (benchmark server and Frank's portfolio hierarchy draft).

 If I left anything out please respond back to everyone, thanks!

Day1 requirements - RisktRAC operations

1) User List 
Need to gather list of all employees that will be using risktRAC for book administration, verify list, then ensure they are setup in the RisktRAC database.
(related to 3) Security Access).

2) Migrate users to Netco
Need to check with network security and/or integration team to find out when the users IDs will be
converted to run on the Netco network.  (Dependency for running RisktRAC on Netco).

3) Security Access
Work with Stephanie to follow up with Security on approval for RisktRAC application: confirm groups and approvers.  	Ensure everyone who does not have RisktRAC will have an e-request submitted.

4) RisktRAC Training
Once users have access to Netco RisktRAC setup timeframe for basic training.  If time permits a hands-on overview could also be arranged, as long as someone can access the Netco RisktRAC from their desk (either user or developer).

5) Website connectivity: 
Distribute RAC website URL to Netco employees 
(confirmed with Bhupesh - http://rac.netco.enron.com )

6) Disable Spreadsheet Position loading: 
In RisktRAC disable the ability to load exotic spreadsheets for Day1 users.

7) Day1 Portfolio Hierarchy
(This step can occur before the books are loaded into RisktRAC.)

Review with Frank Hayden the ideal portfolio hierarchy that should be setup, then have users start building the structure without any associations to real portfolios.
The book-portfolio tie-in will occur with action item 8) Day1 Book-setup Spreadsheet.

8) Day1 Book-setup Spreadsheet
a) Discuss timeline for loading Day1 book data from the book-setup spreadsheet;
    Discuss validation issues and cutoff for loading data.
    Note expected book counts are 164 for Gas and approximately 55 - 60 for Power.

b) Add two columns in the spreadsheet for portfolio creation and hierarchy placement, have users fill in this data with guidance from IT.

9)  Control RisktRAC screen-access
Discuss necessary business groups and screen-access to setup in RisktRAC:  Gas Users, Power Users, Credit Users, Market-Risk Users, any other groups that come to mind.

10)  Book-creation/Portfolio audit:
Develop simple adhoc report to help audit books that are not associated with portfolios.  Discuss validation specifications with Ramesh.

11) Financial checks and balances:  
How can reported position/P&L numbers match up with those reported by accounting?  Need to find out who owns the accounting reporting and see if some adhoc verification can be implemented.


Known RisktRAC requirements beyond Day1

1) Desktop RisktRAC portfolio security 
Review how to implement portfolio-level security in the RisktRAC that is already present on the RAC website.

2) Benchmark Server:
Review with infrastructure how to migrate a copy of the Benchmark Server to a Netco server. 
Debbie and Ramesh to discuss further.

As per our discussions last week, I have attached a trader/book association table for U.S. Gas. If you could get the desks to fill in the appropriate information for the new books, Tara and I will get the data set up in EOL for product selection and testing.

Hello Randy & James,

Below are the forwarded instructions as to how we plan to update the excel dsn's for netco(UBSWenergy).  Only test excels in "_converted" folders, then create/move successful tests to a "_tested" folder (within the corresponding "_converted" folder).  

Call me if you have any prob/questions. 

Thanks,

Subject:	Netco(UBSWenergy) Excel Conversions

Hello again,

We need to convert DSN references in more excel spreadsheets... this time to be used by NetCo(UBSWenergy).   The location of these files begins here: O:\erms\erms_adm\NetCo  including all sub-folders.  Convert excel files(.xls) only.  After you convert a spreadsheet move it to your current folder's "_Converted" folder.

Before you start, please run both the "ODBC DSN Entries for ERMT" and "ODBC DSN Entries for RMS" scripts.  These can be found by going thru the menus "Start", "Programs","System Utility Applications", then "Installation & Diskette Creation".  Afterwards you should see the new DSN's by running your windows "Data Sources (ODBC)" program and looking on the "System DSN" tab.  

Note that the DSN's using Oracle drivers now are followed by "-ora" and the DSN's without "-ora" were previously reserved for use with Microsoft (for oracle) drivers.

Remember, after opening an excel to convert, type [Alt]-[F11] to get to the VBA code.  Then type [Ctrl]-[F] and type "dsn" in the "Find What" field.  Make sure the "Search" selection is on "Current Project".  Keep pressing [Find Next] until you have addressed all dsn references.

The goal is to change all old dsn references to point to the new Netco(UBSWenergy) databases.  For example egsprod will become "ermtp-ora".   Do NOT put "est" in front of these dsn's because that will point to the old ESTate versions of the database!

ERMS Examples:

Example 1: This is the most common type of change.
Original: 
ODBCString = "ODBC;DSN=egsprod;UID=" & Sheet2.Range("UID") & ";PWD=" & Sheet2.Range("PW")
Should be changed to:
ODBCString = "ODBC;DSN=ermtp-ora;UID=" & Sheet2.Range("UID") & ";PWD=" & Sheet2.Range("PW")


Example 2:
Original 
ODBCstring = "ODBC;DSN=egsprod;DBQ=ermt;UID=" & Worksheets("Top Pages").Range("UID") & ";PWD=" & Worksheets("Top Pages").Range("PW")
Should be changed to:
ODBCstring = "ODBC;DSN=ermtp-ora;DBQ=ermtp;UID=" & Worksheets("Top Pages").Range("UID") & ";PWD=" & Worksheets("Top Pages").Range("PW")
(Note that IF their is a DBQ reference, it does NOT have "-ora" afterwards.  This s/b the actual oracle database name)




Example 3: In this example note that the DSN is referencing the variable "DBase" which points to cell B3 (see print-screen below)
ODBCString = "ODBC;DSN=" & DBase & ";UID=" & UserName & ";PWD=" & Password

Originally:
 << OLE Object: Picture (Device Independent Bitmap) >> 

Should be changed to:
 << OLE Object: Picture (Device Independent Bitmap) >> 



Example 4: RMS Example

Original:
   .Connection = "ODBC;DSN=New Rms Production;DBQ=tns:rmsprod_ded;UID=jdoe_pc;PWD=traderjoe;"""
Should be changed to:
  .Connection = "ODBC;DSN=rmsp-ora;DBQ=tns:rmsp;UID=jdoe_pc;PWD=traderjoe;"""
(Note that IF their is a DBQ reference, it does NOT have "-ora" afterwards.  This s/b the actual oracle database name)



There are 650+ excel files to convert so we really appreciate all of the help we can get.

Please call me if you have any questions.

Thanks, (very much!)

The IT group would like to turn off the replication of curves tomorrow.  Have all the ESTATE curve files been converted per the 
instructions below.  Any file that has not been updated will not be able to load curves effective Thursday.

If there is any problem with this timing, please contact me.

Subject:	Updating Curve Files to New Environment

Currently the curves are being published into the old production database and are being replicated to the new Estate environment.      



Here are the steps to migrate the Curve files to the new env.

1)	Load new ODBC driver utilizing script provided
      A) Go to ( Start\Programs\System Utility Applic \ Installation&Diskette Creation)
     Double click on "ODBC DSN Entries for ERMT & ESTERMTP"
              This will load the correct ODBC on your machine
  
  2)   On the Publish tab in the Curve File sheet.
Change the environment name on the 5th row to estermtp
Change the service name on the 5th row to 7550     

3) Then hit the   button on the publish sheet and save the new file.
If the sheet does not have the button, just save the file, close it, and bring it back up.

4)	Save your curves as normal

5)	Any questions or problems, please give me a call 

Russ

 I hope that all of you will attend this meeting, either in person on via video conference.  To make our time productive, please come prepared with the following:

1)  List of what we have done well in Operations and will want to repeat as UBS Warburg Energy.   This can be in your specific area of responsiblity or broader across all aspects of Operations (running risk books, broker check-out, confirmation prep, execution and tracking, scheduling, volume management, settlements, collections, operational analysis, etc.) . 

2)  With the luxury of no history and a fresh start, what would you do differently?  Please be specific, and again your suggestions can relate to your area of responsibility or may be broader.  

3)  If you could change or enhance one thing about the operating systems that you use to do your job, what would that be?  Please be specific and constructive on this.  An answer of "Unify" for instance, will be too broad.  

Call me if you have any questions.  --Sally

Risk groups:

Also, I wanted to let the risk groups know that I met with E&Y yesterday and they noted some items they would like to follow up on.  I've asked them to contact you directly.  Lastly, the form A's prepared were not consistent in regards to the treatment of intercompanies.  E&Y needs the 11/30 form A's without intercompanies.  For those of you who provided Form A's with intercompanies, please break them out and send us a second form.

Thanks

Subject:	Follow up to Jan 29 meeting


Shona,

Thanks for the Form A update meeting yesterday.  Here is a more formal
request for the follow-up items we mentioned.  If you could help point us
in the right direction to obtain this information, it would be appreciated.

1)We would like to review the results for a sample of queries for the Form
A's (whether these are reports generated or the output resulting from the
below queries).

Commodity:  Natural Gas

Transaction Distribution by MTM (#): >=$0mm, <$1mm
Tenor Distribution by MTM ($): >=3 years, <5 years

Commodity:  Electricity

Tenor Distribution by Transactions (#):  <1 year
Trade Type  Distribution by Transactions (#):  Forward
Trade Type Distribution by MTM ($):  Forward

Commodity:  Eastern Coal

Tenor Distribution by MTM ($):  >=5 year, <10 years

Commodity:  C3

Trade Type Distribution by MTM ($):  Swap

All queries are for both financial net and physical net values.

2)As a second follow-up, we would like a description and sample contract
of each product type (for the largest positive MTM within each category),
as defined by each commodity (this is item 8 on our comprehensive request
list)

3) A confirmation for the longest deal for each commodity (also related to
item 8 in our request list)

4)For each commodity other than power and gas (which will be outlined in
separate lists), we would like confirmations for the 10 (or all if fewer
than 10) largest (starting with highest positive MTM) transactions
regardless of termination status (this is item 21d on our comprehensive
request list)


I will try to follow-up with a visit or phone call.

Regards,
Scott

Subject:	Revised East Power UBS Book Listing

As a result of a number of UBS offer declines, the East Power book organization has several changes in comparison to the book list which was originally set up in GCP and other systems.  I am attaching a spreadsheet which details such changes for both the power books and gas books traded by our power traders.  Please do not hesitate to call me with ANY questions!!  

Thanks!

Thanks for the info.  A couple of things about the data: 1) What does the (7,849) BCF represent?  Is that all of ENA Gas?(We can do away with the East and West and just report it as US)  Have we really gotten that much shorter from 11/30, when we were (219) BCF short?  2) Can you also provide the p&l numbers for columns Q through T?

Thanks,

Email the sheet to me for now.  I am going to try to set up another export process later.  You can just replace East and West on your sheet with US.  Canada Power has done their part, but I have not received anything from Canada Gas.  Any assistance on your side would be helpful.

Thanks,
Chris

The 7849 are all in-the-money financial counterparties and all physical deals we are performing on.  We have gotten shorter because that is not all positions we are reporting.  To the true DPR we are reporting additional books but we were told for this purpose you only wanted the deals we plan to perform on.  We don't need the East/West for gas.  I will fill in those additional columns for tomorrows report.  Will you be sending out a new form or shall I make the changes?  Do you want an email daily or have you set up a file for these to be saved into?
Is Canada doing their part?

Kam,  if new locations are discovered over the next few days that will probably be used in New Co please compile them into a list of new locations   We won't need the list until next week (I think).
We aren't going to add the items into the database until the NewCo version of the RMS database is setup.

Thanks again!

Kam, 

Ramesh said it was fine to add these three trading locations to the list.

The enrties will have to be inserted into the range in the "Field Constraints" spreadsheet tab.
I think the dropdowns will automatically update.

If not, please let me know, I can modify the sheet and send out a new version.  Thanks!

To prepare for the simulation test that will run this week, can you please make sure the necessary people in your group have the appropriate access to the UBS application to perform their job function.  For example, I know that the Reports application was used by most groups and that the risk groups also used the Bridge Monitor application.

Although we are not expecting any problems to arise, please let me know of any issues your group has logging onto the system.  Thank you for your help!

Please make appropriate changes to the NETCO ERMS database for the following requests. What needs to be done is to delete all other curve entries in the egs_curve_def and egs_curve points and egs_pub_names which are not listed in the attached file. I will talk to you about it.

We have decided to take the curve history with us to UBS for the attached curves.  We have changed the names for some of the curves so column J has additional curves that we would like to bring history.  We will not continue publishing those in the future however.

I am attaching the curve files we have created.  Please take a look at them and make sure I am not missing curves or have included wrong ones.  We are only going to be setting published locations initially.  I am sending you the curves in three parts due to the size of the files.  The Index file has phys index and GDY, and the Phy file has BOM phys and GD.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Ken Lay announced today that he has resigned from Enron's Board of Directors.  His resignation is effective immediately.  

In a press release, Ken said, "I want to see Enron survive and successfully emerge from reorganization.  Due to the multiple inquiries and investigations, some of which are focused on me personally, I believe that my involvement has become a distraction to achieving this goal."

He added, "My concern is for current and former Enron employees and other stakeholders, and I feel that it is in their best interest for me to step down from the Board."

Susan,

Can I please get a copy of the physical  Portfolio Request form from you so in the future we get these physical books set up correctly.
Could you also tell me what needs to be done differently from all other books.  

We created our own Data Codes and sent them to global counterparties, is there anything else different?

KK

also, can you tell me when the PERFORMANCE book will be ready.  Ed McMicheal needs to value those deals today.

Bill, 

The top half of the attached spreadsheet has already been set up.  However, we need to modify the previous request to include the additional two risk types mentioned below.  The bottom half of the list has yet to be set up.  Let me know if you have any questions.

John

We have already created gas books for the top half of the list.  We now need to attach Gas Daily (I and Y risk types)to these books.  Also, we need to create gas books for the bottom half of the list, as well as, attach Gas Daily (I and Y risk types).

Thank you.

If the central books have 2 set up then I'll leave MC assigned to GD and we need another set of central books set up for P/B/I.  Please have the new books set up in Global first (with new book codes, not MC) then email me the new IDs, book names, book codes and region codes.

The West books should be GD and GDY for Canadian deals.  I would think that the central books should have two set up, one for P/B/I and one for GD.  I believe I had called you and said that the books should be set up like FT-ONT-GDL for the gas daily books.  This is correct.  Thanks.

Subject:	New NETCO books

Phillip/Kam,

The following new Canadian gas books are all assigned to "MC" but a canadian book can either be price/basis/index or gasdaily but it cannot be both (otherwise cause problems in PortCalc).  I remember we discussed about this last time and I was told to use FT-ONTARIO as the example, but there are a lot of FT-ONTARIO books like FT-ONT-CENTRAL and FT-ONT-GDL with different setup.  

For example, 166860 has all P/B/Idx/GD checked which it shouldn't be.  And 166859 has GD checked so does it mean it should be set up as a Canadian gasdaily book?  Then if 166860 - 166877 are Canadian price/basis/index, another book code should be assigned instead of using MC.  Please advise.

I had issues.
The Trade Type Distribution by Transactions(57,619) does not equal the total number of transactions by tenor(57,583) or by MTM(57,583) due to duplicates.  For example,  deal # EX2226.1 is listed as a Forward and a Flex Price.   Subsequently, this deal is counted twice under the Trade Type distribution and only once in the tenor and MTM sections.  I made a cell note in the attached spreadsheet - Cell H49 of FormB - that lists all the duplicates.  Let me know what you think and I can wrap this up Monday a.m. Have a good weekend.

Subject:	Counterparties w/Master Agreements with ECC

This is how the logic is now within UBSWenergy.com:

All counterparties with Master Agreements with ECC that hit a US product must be booked as two legs:  leg one booked between ECC and the counterparty with risk assignment of FT-US/CAND-ERMS; leg two flipping the position out of FT-US/CAND-ERMS to the appropriate risk book (the book on the online product).  This applies only to finanical swaps and not physical deals.

Please let me know if there is going to be a change and if so what the deals should look like in Tagg.  The programmers need time to modify logic and I need time to test!

Thanks for your help.

If you or your group have trouble printing, it may be that they moved a bunch a printers to \\nahou-psecn01v server. If you are on the the old server, you have to delete that printer from your printer set up and reinstall it by going through Start/run and typing in \\nahou-psecn01v, then select your printer. Thanks.

Brian,

Actually we rolled out the 2 leg logic with ECC to start with, with the intention of rolling out the same logic for you guys.  I worked with Kathy last year on this but we never got the programming worked out with the Tagg bridge.  Believe it or not, it was easier to identify the companies with ECC contracts than develop logic around all the counterparties with master agreements with ENA.  I will bring this up, again, to the Tagg people and see what the time frame is on getting this working for you guys.  I think it will be a while considering they are working with all the estate and database programming.  

Hopefully, we can get that for you soon.

Dawn

At this stage, I haven't heard any indications we wouldn't continue to operate this way.  

One important thing here is that this 2 leg logic was never applied to the US counterparties we deal with - so we end up having to book a second leg on any deals we do with a Houston counterparty in EOL.  Since this was obviously considered to be worth doing for the US, I don't see why we wouldn't do it for Canada too - it would be a significant time saver.

Kam, Kathy and Brian,

Concerning the ECC - Riskmantra logic that EOL has in place to convert the transactions that are done with counterparties with ECC master agreements...are we going to continue this way of booking (2 legs)?  If so, can you review the list of counterparties that follows the "2-leg" logic and let me know if there need to be any additions or deletions?

Thanks,
Dawn

You will have access soon - Stephanie will send you your ID's and passwords.

We have a lot of work to do in there - so we don't want everyone in there quite yet.  The problem is - if traders are playing with the products while we are trying to re-build the products and data elements with UBS names - we are going to have issues.

The other thing I want to make sure everyone understands - this is our new production data base - not a test data base.  
There are a limited number of authorized users assigned to "testing" or playing around with the data - and they are responsible for cleaning it up too.   
We will allow people to play for the simulation only.

Once we finish building our UBS production data base - we will the copy it to our test data base - and resume our bridge testing from there to the other test environments (our test environment still has the old Enron data).

Tom,

Everyone in risk management needs to get access to EOL bridge monitor and reports.  What do we need to do to get this and how soon can it be granted?  We need this by Thursday to be prepared for testing.

Thanks

The attached files contain positions and values by counterparty by curve as reported to RAC for cob 11.30.01. 
This file was run yesterday so should contain any adjustments made to closing positions on that date.

Please review for accuracy of reporting and respond if you see material differences in your internal reporting.

Jay,

I just checked my Sitara Reports access, and I was able to login and run a report, however there are still only Enron business units there, so nothing came up on the report.  I don't think the systems are synchronized yet.

Let me know if there's some other way to log in to access the UBSW testing contract/deals.

Thanks,
Susan

John, 

There is another report that needs to be added to our daily duties, it is currently only being done once a month by accounting.

I'll show it to you in the morning.

Kam,
We created the real portfolios of all these books as well. We are waiting on the hierarchy from Risk Controls. If that is delayed, then we will simply dump all the real portfolios under a root portfolio for purposes of testing potential exposure, credit reserve and VaR.

Regards,
Ramesh

Thanks for making those changes.  Let us know when we are ready to start setting up the hierarchy.

Kam, John, we found a few book_id name issues while trying to batch-load the books.

We were able to figure out the issues ourselves, but for your reference here are the changes we made:


FB-EXECUTIVE	M	F	P	FIN	US FINANCIAL                  	ERMS	emglaugh	
FB-EXECUTIVE	M	F	D	FIN	US FINANCIAL                  	ERMS	emglaugh	
FB-EXECUTIVE	M	F	I	FIN	US FINANCIAL                  	ERMS	emglaugh	
FB-EXECUTIVE	M	F	M	FIN	US FINANCIAL                  	ERMS	emglaugh	
FB-EXECUTIVE	M	F	Y	FIN	US FINANCIAL                  	ERMS	emglaugh	

Note all 5 books were labeled as 'FB-EXECUTIVE'.  We instead named them

FB-EXECUTIVE-PRC
FB-EXECUTIVE-BAS
FB-EXECUTIVE-IDX
FB-EXECUTIVE-GDM
FB-EXECUTIVE-GDY

Also, we found these two books that had the same book ID:

FB-WEST1-GDM	M	F	M	WEST1	US GAS WEST	ERMS	plove	

FB-WEST1-GDM	M	F	M	WEST10	US GAS WEST	ERMS	plove	

Note that the second book should be named 'FB-WEST10-GDM', based on the WEST10 Region Code.

We fixed that one as well.

Please update your spreadsheet, and let us know if we need to discuss in the morning.

The next step is the hierarchy, which we should receive from Stephanie or Debbie in the morning.  Thanks.

Andrew

Fyi,

attached are the curve files for your part of the West - basis, index, GDY, phy and gas daily.  Please take a look and make sure I have not put a curve in the wrong region.  Due to size, I am sending them in three different emails. Thanks.

We have just decided to divide the western region into two groups.  I will be heading up the Rockies/NW and Northern California, while Phillip Allen heads up the Southwest and Southern California.  Think about whether or not you  would like to change how you serve our groups going forward.  We will need to divide the curve files to reflect the separate regions.  The Southwest will be defined as EP SJ and EP Permian.  P&L summary reports will be separated into two groups.

Are there any other files/directories that the estate people in risk will need to use to do their jobs.  IT will have to go into each macro and change the database that it is using to the new one they are creating this weekend.  I don't know if any of you are still using any exotic spreadsheets other than the transport model.  Please let me know if there is anything I'm missing.  (curve files)

Here are the files that use ERMS that the estate will be using.

Bill,

Please review the attached spreadsheet.  We need to change both the short name and long name on the Central CAD GCP ID's 166860, 166863, 166867, 166871, 166875, and 166877 to reflect that they are only GD books.  In addition, we also need to set up new GCP ID's for the FB-CENTX-CAD books to reflect that they are Price, Basis and Index.  Please call me to discuss if needed.  I will be out this afternoon, however, I will be checking my email as well as voice messages and returning calls.  My cell phone # is 713-628-9468.  Thanks.


John

Question for NetCo employees:
The new corp id's xfer to UBS is being considered for this Sunday.  Hence, no start menu access to estate.  You will still have access to NT estate drive data to copy.
Does anyone have the need to retain a estate id for support estate application during the last week?  Exceptions have to be authorized.
Wanted to get a preliminary need analysis...
 
This was sent by an IT manager, let me know your thoughts... O

This is a list of the curves we will be using in Netco.  We may have some additional curves to add to this list but I wanted to get you something to start with.

Here is an updated version of the template, it should be easier to use as you have all split out your books into 3 (terminated by the counterparty, not being fulfilled, and active).  Again, this should be as of positions held today.  Based on my discussions with you so far, it looks like this is doable by the end of next week.

Please call me if you have questions.

Best regards

Hi Kam,
 
As per our phone conversation, I have attached a listing of all the products which are being migrated to EOL NetCo. If Risk could fill in the traders which will be managing each product and the Global Book ID, we will use that data as the basis for an update script to automatically assign the new books to each product. 
 
I'll be in the office early tomorrow if you have any questions, or would like to go over any special book assignments that may need to be covered outside of a mass-update.
 
Thanks,

Wow, good for her! I think an entry level power trader usually does hourly trading stuff -and shiftwork.  Sounds like a good opportunity though. The UBS weather gig might be a great opportunity to get started in a "new" organization but, frankly, I wish all of the media attention would blow over first. I can't imagine how you guys must feel about all of the media coverage over there.

I wonder if they're starting up their own consulting company? I have a few things presently in the works. I'm hoping to touch base with Scott N. sometime today. Too bad I couldn't make a living by being a frequent job switcher.  I could be good at that.  Things would be a hell of a lot easier if I was willing to take a job out of state.

We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8.

To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST). It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading.

Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our "live" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will:

Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.)
Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup
Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week

Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions:

Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups:
Profile tests for "external" customers (role-played by Originators)
Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.)
Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems

Traders and Originators:
Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation.
Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation.

Information Technology:
Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation.
After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books
Will ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete.


Next steps 

Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system.
Originators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6.
UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation.


Summary

This simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform.

If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861).

The counterparties that CPR uses in correlation to the SITARA portfolios set up, should not be set up as books, they should be set up 
like the example below.  All the PB counterparties need to be set up like the example below.  The PB should not be set up as books.

Any questions or comments, please call me.

I have heard that the Canadians want to trade tomorrow.
We would need to create new books for them and set up roles.

Please let us know what has to happen.

Could you run the detail for these post-id's in grey.  These are the physical post-id's that were excluded from the original request.  You don't need to run the other post-id's, just the new column I.

Thanks again,

Can we delete the Chicago books from Global Counterparties.  We will not be using these books at all.  Let me know if this would be possible.  The GCP id's are 166896, 167105, and 166898.  Thanks.

Subject: Monday 01/28 - Status report of integration testing, remaining, ou=
tstanding issues, going forward


Everyone - updates from testing last week, and communication of information=
/ going forward.
=20
Thanks to all involved in last weeks testing.  Much has been accomplished. =
 We did encounter a legal mandated 'test freeze' on Friday given a legal co=
mmunication came down to halt all data entry/ code changes, but as of Frida=
y evening, it was eventually lifted.  Any unfinished testing can continue.
=20
We've completed:
- Integration testing of 25 transaction type scenarios - from EOL entry, Si=
tara, TDS, Tagg.  This includes the sample testing of scripts, and the end =
to end testing to SAP.
- EOL has sent 13 gas and 4 financial transactions through downstream syste=
ms.
- Over 50 integration issues identified and resolved!  Majority were data s=
etup issues, but code changes were identified, incorrect hardware being use=
d, reports not running, start-up scripting issues resolved, replication iss=
ues resolved.
=20
What's remaining to test and status:
1) EDI testing - Tammy Jaquet, Robert Virnau are expected to complete the E=
DI test by end of day today (01/28)
2) Financial Settlements/ EOL deals - Mechelle Stevens is completing her ve=
rification of EOL deals into Unify.  Testing is expected to complete the ED=
I test by end of day today (01/28).
3) SAP testing - SAP is still in requirements analysis with regards to GL a=
ccount setup, profit centers.  A meeting is scheduled for Wednesday afterno=
on with the UBS, SAP, Netco leads.  SAP testing can be conducted between Un=
ify and within SAP once decisions are determined.
=20
Any other issues we are not aware of, please advise.
=20
Outstanding known issues:
1) Unify custom reports (SQR) not working.  This was not part of integratio=
n test, but testing by Kelley Huntley on Friday resulted in failure.  Infra=
structure expected to resolve by Monday noon.
2) There is some data setup that is being completed Monday morning and shou=
ld be complete by now.
=20
Any other issues we are not aware of, please advise.
=20
Going forward:
1) The Netco EOL (or new OLT?) team will be testing all week deals into Net=
co environments.  You may see these in downstream systems.
2) Analysis of what estate data still resides in Netco, and what needs to b=
e there to go forward.  Namely curve data for EnPower.
3) We will perform regression testing to determine if there are any cross d=
ependency of hardware.  Testing scenarios include:
    a) Application messaging that use Tibco (port, multi-cast addresses)
    b) Estate execution with Netco hardware inactive
    c) Netco execution with Estate hardware inactive
=20
Notice/ FYI - All Netco (UBS) employee's LAN NT user-id's will be changed t=
o a new file server (anticipated Friday 02/01). =20
The impacts are mainly the O:\ drive, W:\ drive will be split between Estat=
e and Netco.  All authorized (legal) data is being copied now to the new fi=
le servers.
For example, if Netco employees need specific files on the O:\ drive, if th=
ey are missing, they would have remained with estate.  If you have files in=
 progress, they
may missing the batch file copy which is occurring this week.
=20
Updates to follow later this week!

Kam,

We added a group link (NETCO) to the Netco Books to quickly consolidate data.  I attached an excell spreadsheet with the consolidated NETCO books you requested
yesterday.

Cheryl,

Thanks for taking care of these so quickly.

I have reattached the central book request with some additional books.  The blue highlighted "Cent" books were on the original request but were labeled as "FB" and should have been PB as the book name.  I assume you did nothing with those books because there was no id next to it.  Is that correct?
I corrected them and also added two new books at the bottom.

Thanks again,

Kam

Hi Kam,

Per your request, the books have been created in GCP, and the CP ID's are on the attached spreadsheets.

Cheryl,

The risk management group will be taking over the duties from the controls group as far as setting up new books.  I have attached five book requests that need to be set up for Netco.  Once these are set up can you please call me so I can tell Cecilia.  I will also need the Global ID # to give to EOL for their needs.


Thanks,

Kam

Dawn,

At this stage, I haven't heard any indications we wouldn't continue to operate this way.  

One important thing here is that this 2 leg logic was never applied to the US counterparties we deal with - so we end up having to book a second leg on any deals we do with a Houston counterparty in EOL.  Since this was obviously considered to be worth doing for the US, I don't see why we wouldn't do it for Canada too - it would be a significant time saver.

Brian

Kam, Kathy and Brian,

Concerning the ECC - Riskmantra logic that EOL has in place to convert the transactions that are done with counterparties with ECC master agreements...are we going to continue this way of booking (2 legs)?  If so, can you review the list of counterparties that follows the "2-leg" logic and let me know if there need to be any additions or deletions?

Thanks,
Dawn

Any thing that is not terminated per legal.

I am sure they will want them split between in the money and out of the money.

So think about how we get there.

Hey guys,

Each book should have been split into 3 books - 

- terminated by the counterparty
- ongoing transactions (active) and
- transactions that have not yet been terminated by a counterparty but that we are not going to fullfil.

The DPR should only have the active transactions in it. Hope that clarifies!

In regards to the (5,500) BCF position reported for US Gas on 1/29, Kam indicated it is really in contracts.  As there are 100 contracts per BCF, the position should actually be (55) BCF.  Please make the appropriate conversion going forward.  

Kam- I also learned that there are 1,000,000 mmbtu's per BCF.

Kam,

Your revised request has been been completed and I saved the "revised" cent book on the O drive.  Also, we are working on the request you just sent.

Cheryl,

Thanks for taking care of these so quickly.

I have reattached the central book request with some additional books.  The blue highlighted "Cent" books were on the original request but were labeled as "FB" and should have been PB as the book name.  I assume you did nothing with those books because there was no id next to it.  Is that correct?
I corrected them and also added two new books at the bottom.

Thanks again,

Kam

Cheryl,

The risk management group will be taking over the duties from the controls group as far as setting up new books.  I have attached five book requests that need to be set up for Netco.  Once these are set up can you please call me so I can tell Cecilia.  I will also need the Global ID # to give to EOL for their needs.


Thanks,

Kam

Security access for the "Estate" will be the same as Production currently is.
Access for "Netco" will have to be set up from scratch.
Can each of you give me a list of the people that should have access to  "Netco".
Access is still preliminarily being set up on a West, East, Central and Texas regional basis.
Included in the list should be Risk, Logistics, Trading and anyone else that you know of that you want to have access to your region..

The plan is to have a large mass set up,  additional updates will be handled under eRequest, under the new application region code "Houston - Netco"
(This name will be changed later)

Any questions or comments, please give me a call.

Russ

To simplify the DPR reporting each Wednesday and Monday, please use the attached spreadsheet to populate and return via email.  This is a temporary solution and I will be working to set up a new export process the streamline reporting.  I would appreciate it if the spreadsheets were emailed priro to noon each Wednesday and Monday.  The main info to include are the positions, p&l and PRMA.
 
Please remember to include only the information related to active deals that we anticipate fulfilling.  If there are any pieces that should be captured, and for whatever reason you are not able to at this time, please note that as a caveat at the bottom of the spreadsheet.

Stephanie - as we discussed - go ahead and set up the back office users in the new production data base.
Please just remind them that this is production - and not a test environment.  

Some authorized users are testing certain elements of the data base - but they are responsible for making sure the test data is cleaned up.

Everyone in risk management needs to get access to EOL bridge monitor and reports.  What do we need to do to get this and how soon can it be granted?  We need this by Thursday to be prepared for testing.

This is how the logic is now within UBSWenergy.com:

All counterparties with Master Agreements with ECC that hit a US product must be booked as two legs:  leg one booked between ECC and the counterparty with risk assignment of FT-US/CAND-ERMS; leg two flipping the position out of FT-US/CAND-ERMS to the appropriate risk book (the book on the online product).  This applies only to finanical swaps and not physical deals.

Please let me know if there is going to be a change and if so what the deals should look like in Tagg.  The programmers need time to modify logic and I need time to test!

Thanks for your help.

Could we change the gas daily intra-month and index to GDM and GDY, rather than GDL and GDX.  Tell me how much trouble that is to change.  IT also made some changes to the physical org region names.  I will have to get you those changes.

Thanks

ETX was supposed to be Electronic Transaction.  An exchange is a regulated =

We should be careful not to use the word "exchange".  I know this sounds tr=

Please review the progress report from Monday's regression test below.   It=
 was a success, and the goals were accomplished!  Thank you for your partic=
ipation!
All the issues should be resolved by now.  If you are aware of any open iss=
ues, please email me ASAP.
Invoices are being settled now, and we are starting the SAP testing for thi=
s afternoon.
=20
We need your testing help (again), with the following tests below.  These a=
re limited to ETX (the name formally known as EOL) entered deals only, but =
need to process to SAP.
Please review attached for those scheduled, and respond with any updates/ s=
ubstitutions.
=20
Wednesday 10:00am - 03:00pm
Test:  Mock-mock test - ETX deal entry only.
Purpose:  Perform a simulation of a 4 gas physical/ financial, 4 power phys=
ical/ financial transactions using (Reliant/ Duke/ Williams/ UBS Warburg En=
ergy/ Enron Canada).=20
Goals include:
    (1) Simulate processing ETX transactions before Thursday mock test
    (2) If the NT user id conversion goes through on 02/05 pm, use the new =
UBS Id's
    (3) Validate any systems changes from Monday/ Tuesday
=20

User involvement:  See attached schedule.   Please review and respond if an=
y changes are needed.
    Global data should be setup already given we will use existing counterp=
arties/ addresses/ contracts.
=20
The ETX deals will be entered by 10:30, and we need the participants to pro=
cess these downstream.

1305 UBS Warburg Energy LLC acting as agent for UBS AG, London Branch

Test:  Mock ETX test -  ETX deal entry only.
=20
Purpose:  The business is planning a mock trading session tentatively for 2=
/7 (Thursday). The plan is to use the UBS production systems. The traders w=
ill be using the EOL Stack Manager and their own real products. The origina=
tors will be hitting the web site using valid counterparty accounts.  ETX e=
ntry should last about 2 hours (probably 9am-11am), however, we need to set=
tle these in the afternoon.
UBSW personnel will be monitoring the transactions from deal entry to SAP.

Subject: PROGRESS REPORT - Netco testing schedule for Monday, Feb 4th


Below is an end of day progress report on Monday's regression test.
=20
Summary: =20
We did complete as planned the 25 types of transactions, including global d=
ata setup, deal entry (EOL, Sitara, TDS, EnPower) scenarios.    EOL passed =
us 25 Gas and 40 power scenarios of which we tested a subset of transaction=
s.  Today's test went a bit smoother given we pushed for the counterparties=
, contracts to be setup in advance.  We will continue with the Gas settleme=
nt on Tuesday morning, along with SAP processing at 1:00pm.
=20
>From a technical code perspective, there were no major interface issues.  I=
ncluding TDS/ Sitara interface to Tagg as discussed earlier.
Errors reported include continued NT userid "pilot burn-in" issues, as well=
 as replication issues with data.  Given we are processing in a very 'trunc=
ated' environment, downstream systems can have missing global data needed (=
regions, facilities, SAP information).  The open issues are being escalated=
 and should be addressed by 10:00am tomorrow morning.
=20

The goals of this regression test on Monday/ Tuesday are:
1) regression test a subset of scenarios (ie Physical Gas Sale, Physical Po=
wer Supply, Financial Swap, Intercomapny) now that the Global Data is more =
stable (UBS internal counterparties, profit centers, desks/ books)=20
2) Identify any reference to internal/ external screens that still have 'EN=
RON' reference, or 'EOL' reference
3) Ensure we have the latest price curve data from updates (ie TAGG/ERMS)
4) process new EOL data created for Monday.  To verify mid/ back office, in=
cluding SAP processing.   EOL will also push data from a mock trading sessi=
on for on 2/7 (see below)=20
5) provide the test data scenarios for SAP testing (scheduled Tuesday 1pm).=
  SAP is completing their setup with the new controlling area for NetCo.=20
6) Continue with NT Logins involved with PILOT until remaining are ported.
=20
=20
Accomplishments/  what worked?
1) Confirmation/ updates of most recent price curves into ERMS.  The data p=
rior was from mid December.
2) Working with only the subset of counterparties as authorized as 'Active'
3) EOL deals did flow downstream.  However, the major were future periods t=
hat we cannot settle.  We modified the data to correspond to what downstrea=
m needed.
4) Gas - Volume Management, Logistics, and leading into Settlement
5) Power/ Financial  - EnPower/ Tagg, confirmations, leading into settlemen=
t
=20
=20
What did not?
1) Canada testing is still catching up, but improving.  They are identifyin=
g the counterparties, pipelines, test scenarios and anticipate continuing t=
o test Tuesday.  =20
2) Facilities missing, Canada pipelines missing, contracts not replicating =
into Unify (resolved).=20
3) Unify Tagg Deal Load.  The Unify Tagg Deal load was discovered at 5pm, a=
nd will be addressed early Tuesday am.
=20
Focus on Tuesday
Given the new SAP environment has not been tested to date, we will monitor =
the Unify transmission/ SAP processing (scheduled for 1pm till). =20
There is much risk within SAP given the new counterparties, entities, xref =
tables, SAP information is just being setup.  We will also validate the int=
ercompany transactions created on Monday.
=20
Note:  Tuesday night (6pm - 8pm) is the scheduled NetCo test with Estate Sh=
utdown.

It appears that the following email may not have been clear.  You have to copy all documents yourself.

This is my cheat sheet if it helps:  

H Drives:
1.  Each person will have to move any data over personally from the old H drive (which is now Z:) drive to their new H drive.  
2. The Z: drive (old H:) will be removed from UBS employees on Thursday night.

O Drives:
1. For the old O or M drives go to O:\ESTATE\ O (or M ? pending location of data) and copy to the new common O.  The Estate O and M will be removed from UBS employees on Thursday night.

Do not delete anything and only copy information which is complies with the policy.  Please make sure that those people who are not in the office are contacted and comply.

Can we also get the books that these used to be mapped to?  That will eliminate about 75% of the work.
 
Thanks

Hi Kam,
 
As per our phone conversation, I have attached a listing of all the products which are being migrated to EOL NetCo. If Risk could fill in the traders which will be managing each product and the Global Book ID, we will use that data as the basis for an update script to automatically assign the new books to each product. 
 
I'll be in the office early tomorrow if you have any questions, or would like to go over any special book assignments that may need to be covered outside of a mass-update.
 
Thanks,

Melba and I will be testing the "EOL" database and bridges this week.  Please beware of the large amount of testing we will be doing. We will be using Dynegy as the external counterparty, but we will let you know if we use another counterparty.  In addition to the usual test scripts, we will be testing all facets of EOL to make sure everything is working correctly.

O'Neal, I will be working with you to make sure the deals are bridging correctly into Tagg and Sitara.  Melba will be working with power risk team (Casey, Andrea and Melissa) to verify deals in Enpower.  

Thank you in advance for your help.

Does this need to exclude intercompany deals also?

Here is an updated version of the template, it should be easier to use as you have all split out your books into 3 (terminated by the counterparty, not being fulfilled, and active).  Again, this should be as of positions held today.  Based on my discussions with you so far, it looks like this is doable by the end of next week.

Please call me if you have questions.

Best regards

Now that we have almost all of the Form A information , E&Y needs form B filled out for all commodities.  We would like to have this as of the deals on 1/31/02.

Please let me know when you will be able prepare the schedule (including a reconciliation to your rolls).

In order for UBS Warburg to timely process your paycheck, I am requesting that all employee's accepting offers return any outstanding forms to my new desk location at  05852 on the 5th floor of ECS (Look for the Hamburg Flag) by noon this Friday  2/01/02.  This will prevent any benefit deductions from having to be "Double Deducted" on future checks.  Please attach a deposit slip or voided check stub to your direct deposit form.  Attached below are the forms needed for payroll/benefits, in case you did not turn these in at Orientation.  Lastly, please verify that your EHRonline home address is showing your current home address because all live checks will be mailed to your home residence. 

    

Thanks, Tony Jarrett

Bill, just a follow up to the book list that you sent. Regarding West Hourly, it looks like it is NETCO-ST-HOURLY. This will work, but the problem is that it doesn't differentiate between the west and east trading groups. Am I reading this wrong? My request was for the short name to be NETCO-W-HOURLY.

Melba, in response to one of your emails to me, West Hourly is set up as noted above.

The spreadsheets have it as region, e.g. WEST1, WEST2, etc.

Please let us know if you require a change in the CPR regions.

The following file appeared to work fine - \\nahou\houston\common\erms\Docs\XL_estate\01\Hal\HS_FT-Wellhead.xls.

However, some of the other files had a data source message box (see below) appear when I hit the GRMS Macro:
Files that did not connect:
\\nahou\houston\common\erms\Docs\XL_estate\01\Felicia\Copy of HS_IM-East-Gulf.xls

Let me know if this is expected.

As you convert files  to point to the estate please move the file to a folder with your name (in the same directory).

Scott - 

Please zero out the demand charges for Virginia Natural Gas November 2001 production on the following deals:

602027
602028
602021
602018
602019
602020

I also need the deal 1020386 price for November 2001 to be changed to zero.  The volumes need to stay the way they are but this is a pass through charge to the customer and they have paid this amount to Transco.

Please call me if you have any questions and please let me know when this is done so I can process it in the back office.

Thanks for your assistance.

During the course of their investigation, Special Agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation will be taking documents they believe may be important for their investigation from employees' offices.  The FBI has agreed to return copies of such documents. 

In addition, should you have an immediate need for a document requested by the FBI, please make a copy of the specific document and give the original to the FBI. Thank you for your cooperation.

There will be a seperate database for Netco and Estate. 
The attached file has all of the current mappings.   It can also be found in the O:/dropbox/Sitara
Any questions, just give me a call -  I am just waiting in the old building for a presentation to BP.

Russ,

Can we get a list of the mappings for all sitara locations.  We are modifying our curve files by getting rid of all "internal" curves.  We need to make sure that we don't have anything mapped to those curves and if so make some changes.

We also need to think about how this change will work with the estate as well.  Will sitara have a separate database for Netco and estate like TAGG will?

I understand about the Risk issue, but I was interested in what people were in each function group for Netco.
I have received information on each group now except Central.

Security access for the "Estate" will be the same as Production currently is.
Access for "Netco" will have to be set up from scratch.
Can each of you give me a list of the people that should have access to  "Netco".
Access is still preliminarily being set up on a West, East, Central and Texas regional basis.
Included in the list should be Risk, Logistics, Trading and anyone else that you know of that you want to have access to your region..

The plan is to have a large mass set up,  additional updates will be handled under eRequest, under the new application region code "Houston - Netco"
(This name will be changed later)

Any questions or comments, please give me a call.

Dear Jim & Barry,

We are getting info from gas and power.  We do have an issue with the inception to date P&L (see Chris's memo), and I'm also a bit concerned with the accuracy gas position reported to us of 5500 (short).  We've discussed it with Jeff's group and they have confirmed it, but it still seems a bit big to me.

Well keep working.

Best regards

This is a temporary solution and I will be working to set up a new export process the streamline reporting.  I would appreciate it if the spreadsheets were emailed priro to noon each Wednesday and Monday.  The main info to include are the positions, p&l and PRMA.
 
Please remember to include only the information related to active deals that we anticipate fulfilling.  If there are any pieces that should be captured, and for whatever reason you are not able to at this time, please note that as a caveat at the bottom of the spreadsheet.

Dear Colleagues,

We know you have many questions about your new benefits plan, payroll issues and other changes that will occur over the next few weeks. Human Resources and Communications are preparing a thorough Q&A, which we will send to you tomorrow and will regularly update as more information is available. 

Meanwhile, please read the announcement below from Security about how you can obtain a new UBS Warburg access card that will allow you to enter our new office space after Friday.

I am confident that you share my enthusiasm about our new opportunity.  We look forward to working along side each of you in the coming days.

David Oxley
Head, Human Resources
____________________________________________________________________

Access Cards

There will be a two-day transition for the new UBS Warburg access cards. Beginning Monday, February 11, access to the 5th and 6th floors of Enron Center South will require these new cards. UBS Warburg access cards can be picked up from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the reception area on the 5th floor of Enron Center South on Thursday, February 7th ; Friday, February 8th ; and Monday, February 11. Enron Security will produce new access cards with existing photographs, then simultaneously issue the new and collect the old cards. Employees without UBS Warburg cards will be allowed into the Enron Center South building on Monday but will have to collect their new cards as soon as possible to gain access to the 5th and 6th floors.

Employees who fail to collect their new cards by 7 p.m. Monday will be required to contact Enron Security's general information number at 713-853-5360 to arrange to pick them up.

There will be security staff available at the pick up point on ECS 5 to help with any problems you might have.

It is suggested employees wear their access cards at all times while on the premise.

Accessible Areas - The new cards will allow UBS-W employees to enter:
5th & 6th floors and Plaza area of Enron Center South , 
The Sky Ring 
Body Shop, Enron Center North Plaza and therefore access the Credit Union and Cafeteria from either building.

Restricted Areas - Employees must submit to Enron Security a Restricted Access Request form (available by calling 713 8535360 ) and signed by Bob McAuliffe (713-853-7468) to enter:
Enron Center South, 8th and 9th floors
Enron Center North, 22nd and 34th floor 
Ardmore Data Center.

Employees staying with the Enron estate while visa and other issues are completed - Employees in this group who are on assignment arrangements to UBS-W will be issued a regular access card - available in the same way as other new UBS-W employees.

Estate employees who are working with UBS-W on transition issues  - If they will be based in UBS-W office space they should talk to their UBS-W counterpart for approval and then UBSW HR for the issue of a UBS-W contractor card (in addition to their regular Enron badge).

Security access for the "Estate" will be the same as Production currently is.
Access for "Netco" will have to be set up from scratch.
Can each of you give me a list of the people that should have access to  "Netco".
Access is still preliminarily being set up on a West, East, Central and Texas regional basis.
Included in the list should be Risk, Logistics, Trading and anyone else that you know of that you want to have access to your region..

The plan is to have a large mass set up,  additional updates will be handled under eRequest, under the new application region code "Houston - Netco"
(This name will be changed later)

Any questions or comments, please give me a call.

Hi Kam,
 
Could you send us your updated address?  Yahoo says you still live on 4444 Westheimer, which I know is wrong.  We would like to send you a wedding invite.  Have a happy holiday.
 
Take care,
 
JR

Question for NetCo employees:
The new corp id's xfer to UBS is being considered for this Sunday.  Hence, no start menu access to estate.  You will still have access to NT estate drive data to copy.
Does anyone have the need to retain a estate id for support estate application during the last week?  Exceptions have to be authorized.
Wanted to get a preliminary need analysis...
 
This was sent by an IT manager, let me know your thoughts... O

Torrey,

Here are the new mappings for the EOL products, except for the central desk.  Hunter is still working on his but I wanted to get you something.

for physical rest of month deals we attached the physical book id
for prompt month physical deals we attached the TAGG book id

is that correct?


I will send the finished product when Hunter is done.  Keep in mind it will probably change again.

Currently the curves are being published into the old production database and are being replicated to the new environment.      



Here are the steps to migrate the Curve files to the new env.

1)	Load new ODBC driver utilizing script provided
      A) Go to ( Start\Programs\System Utility Applic \ Installation&Diskette Creation)
     Double click on "ODBC DSN Entries for ERMT & ESTERMTP"
              This will load the correct ODBC on your machine
  
  2)   On the Publish tab in the Curve File sheet.
Change the environment name on the 5th row to estermtp
Change the service name on the 5th row to 7550     

3) Then hit the   button on the publish sheet and save the new file.
If the sheet does not have the button, just save the file, close it, and bring it back up.

4)	Save your curves as normal

5)	Any questions or problems, please give me a call

Due to changes to the database relative to the change to "Netco", the curve files will need to be upgraded.  The majority of the files
will be able to be upgraded by each individual with a minimal of effort.  Older files will take extra effort.  Can you have your people 
identify how many old files we have.  The old files can be identified by looking at the "Publish" tab in the Admin box located at F2:G3.

The old files will only have the button  (Reset Rows/Columns)

The new files will have 3 buttons   (Reset Rows/Columns)
                                                  (Load Modules)(Re Init)


Knowing which files still have the old format will help the IT group plan for this migration.
If you could have your people check and get back to me as soon as possible, I would appreciate it.

Thanks
Russ

Albert,

I spot checked a few of these and they are not all official.  Can you please list only the Nov 30th official post-id's?  I can't tell from your post-id sheets if I'm picking the correct ones.

Thanks

We can inactivate these books enmasse in risktrac to start with. The position capture jobs will flip them to active if a position comes in on it.
Please just confirm this and we will make it inactive.

Hi Kam,

I have already applied there online last week but I am afraid that it may have gone into that great HR black hole. Thank you for the heads up, though.  Do you have any contacts there?  Scott Neal has been trying to get a hold of me.  UBS is looking for some weather guys because a bunch of weather people left there.  Now wouldn't that be funny if I ended up back there in a different capacity?

Here are the test deals we completed today.  Please check these deals in the appropriate downstream systems to make sure they are bridging into tagg, sitara and enpower correctly.  Beware that some of these deals are duplicates.  Let me know if any of these are bridging incorrectly so that I can get the programmers to look at it.

O'Neal, please pay special attention to the gas daily deals.  I believe that I tested the one leg, two leg and four leg gas daily deals. 

Thanks,
Dawn

Please pass this onto the individuals in your groups:

Tomorrow's simulation and Friday's desk to desk trading will provide an excellent opportunity for us to double check the online deals in tagg and sitara.  Please pay special attention to these deals and let me know of any bridging issues.  Even though we have been testing and having various people check the deals in the underlying systems, I am afraid of any logic that may be hardcoded in the bridge. 

Notify me immediately of any deals that are bridging incorrectly and I will try to resolve as soon as possible.  I will also be watching the bridge to research any failed deals.

Thanks for your help.  Let's hope for a smooth transition!

There is a P&L Summary for east desk in the Netco directory located at O:/ERMS/erms_adm/Netco/2002/0102/Regions0102/_Converted/East P&L Summ. Please take a look at it and tell me what you think. To simplify and speed up the reporting process, I added buttons that will link to the P&L's. The format may or may not resemble formats used on other desks, but I do believe the data shown is comprehensive.

Errol - This may not fit your needs on the financial desk. You may need to design your own. If so, let me know if I can help. 


Thanks.

Make sure on the TDS Curve Manager not to hit the    button on the publish sheet.  This button normally
brings in the latest version of code, however the latest version does not include information for the 'Y' curve.
This will be fixed after the code freeze that is now in place is released.

Any questions or problems, give me a call.

The curve files for Netco will need to be modified before they are used in the new environment.


    1)   On the Publish tab in the Curve File sheet.
Change the environment name on the 5th row to ermtp
Change the service name on the 5th row to 7525
Change the Network Address on the 5th row to ;239.44.16.1;     

2) Then hit the   button on the publish sheet and save the new file.
If the sheet does not have the button, just save the file, close it, and bring it back up.

3)	Save your curves as normal

4)	Any questions or problems, please give me a call

This document illustrates what my group does, what I expect will be needed from my group in a new entity ("NewCo") and lastly what will be needed to wind down/sell the remaining businesses ("OldCo").

I believe that a risk controls group is needed as part of NewCo not only to issue consolidated reporting, but to perform analysis of risk data and maintain the analytic systems.

Any feedback would be appreciated.

Kam,

Sorry that you will miss our wedding.  Last I heard there are still some
open weather positions at UBS.  They are apparently starting from the
ground up.  This means that they are looking to hire some chief weather wiz
(probably PHD type with some gas industry experience) first and then start
developing a department.   I also heard that UBS is likely not going to
start trading until early April.  Is this what you are hearing too? I am
keeping all my options open.  The job market is terrible and likely getting
worse.  You see what WMB and CPN have been doing lately?   Ouch!

See ya,

JR

Hey,

I am going to have to miss your wedding.  Unfortunately, I will be in Plano
that weekend.  I wish I could make it.

What's going on with the UBS weather position?  Has that gone anywhere or
are the other possibilities you had better?

Talk to you soon,

Kam

Hey guys,

I am being told by my better half that we need to get an accurate head
count of who will be attending our wedding.  If you would be so kind, could
you possibly let me know of your status over the next couple of days?  For
those of you who already sent us an RSVP response recently, please
disregard.

Thanks for your help!

This is to inform you that on January 25, 2002 the Honorable Arthur Gonzalez, United States Bankruptcy Judge for the Southern District of New York, entered an order as follows:

It is hereby Ordered that until further Order of this Court, Enron Corp., its affiliated debtors-in-possession in these jointly administered chapter 11 proceedings (collectively "Enron"), and Enron's employees shall preserve, and refrain from destroying or disposing of, any of Enron's records, either in electronic or paper form.

Obviously, any violation of this order will carry serious consequences.  We know that we can depend on you to comply with it fully.

Thank you.

John/Bill,

Canadian GD books (e.g.166860) are already set up in Tagg/Erms using MC.  Please continue to use MC for the GD books and use MK for the P/B/I books.

I'll update the book names on our side to reflect the changes.  And the P/B/I books will be created today.

Please let me know when the corrections are made.

Thanks,

Bill,

Please review the attached spreadsheet.  We need to change both the short name and long name on the Central CAD GCP ID's 166860, 166863, 166867, 166871, 166875, and 166877 to reflect that they are only GD books.  In addition, we also need to set up new GCP ID's for the FB-CENTX-CAD books to reflect that they are Price, Basis and Index.  Please call me to discuss if needed.  I will be out this afternoon, however, I will be checking my email as well as voice messages and returning calls.  My cell phone # is 713-628-9468.  Thanks.

All -
 
Starting Wednesday, we all have lots of work to do to get the new company up and running on time.  Going forward,  we need to be a proactive organization as opposed to a reactive organization.  Given that we have the best people in the organization going over, this should not be difficult to accomplish.
 
Let me be very clear.  Playing on the internet will not be tolerated.  There is too much that has to get done over the next two weeks.  That message needs to be communicated to everyone going to the new company.  If people feel like they do not have anything to do,  they should be reading about options or the gas business.  This is a great opportunity for people to make themselves better employees.  I have no problem changing the lists if someone steps up,  or if someone doesn't.  
 
Below,  are a few things I need your help with over the next few days.

(i)    Budget (due Jan 2, 2002)                                                 
        First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized) 

Each of you needs to draw up a budget for your region by the end of the day Wednesday.  Use the format that we used for the Enron 2002 Budget process.  Russ and Greg.  You will be one cost center in the new organization.

John,  can you be responsible for coordinating this and compiling all budgets into one by Wednesday night?


(ii)     Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 3)                               To be forwarded to Louise       
        These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.     

I need to detailed plans for what files we are moving,  the systems we need,  and anything that will make the move better for the business.

Kam - Can you coordinate and give me the list be Thursday evening?

(iii)   Seating Plans                                                   Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate 
        We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.

If you have any preferences in this area let me know ASAP, so that I can make requests now.

(iv)    Due Diligence 
        We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

Just so you know, there will be more people in this week.

Please let me know how I can help in getting everything done.  I look forward to a great year working with all of you.  Thanks for all of your hard work.

 

Jeff

Could you please let me know if there are any procedures that any UBS people are still running that should be run by the estate team?  If there are, please send me a list of them so we can have someone take them over.

Could we change the gas daily intra-month and index to GDM and GDY, rather than GDL and GDX.  Tell me how much trouble that is to change.  IT also made some changes to the physical org region names.  I will have to get you those changes.

Raj,

I spoke with Zhiyong and they are going to run the script overnight and give a status in the morning.  

Kam has sent Zhiyong a tentative list and is confirming with RAC that she has all the right post id's.  I have asked Zhiyong to run with the tentative list.

US Global Products and Coal Post ID's have been sent to Zhiyong.  We will send the London Global products post id's first thing in the morning.

EIM book data has been extracted via a fetch macro and we have begun creating the schedule A for those books and hope to have it for cob tomorrow.

Sheila Glover and Clara Carrrington are working on the fx/interest rate books and Sheila will provide an update on progress cob tomorrow.


Kam, Zhiyong, Todd and Sheila,

If any of the above is incorrect, please feel free to correct.

Kevin

Kam,

I found the following comment in Global Counterparty regarding the suspension of TXU Energy Trading Company (CP ID 69034):

 

Cheryl Johnson in the GCP group suspended this record due to the merger which resulted in the final name of TXU Energy Trading Company LP.  It sounds like deals need to be moved over to the new CP name.  You will need to coordinate that with Cheryl because she will have to re-activate the CP ID to do that.

Please let me know if you have any further questions.

Thanks,
SBR x30569

Are there any more revisions for the Power Books. We are going to put together a list of all books to date with all revisions sent to us as of yesterday.  Once this is put together, we will send to each of you to ensure complete accuracy, therefore, any revisions that we may have should be caught on the list following later today.  Again, let me know of any other revisions we may have.  Thanks.

RUSSELL I DIAMOND 
Phone : (713) 345-7095 
Had requested that I should get in touch with you.

He has a list of 2491 deals that he wants Mark-to-market values for specific dates.
- Mark to market for Dec 11 for Deals that are on the Bankrupcy book
- Current mark to market for deals that are on the PG  book
- Current mark to market for deals on other books, other than the Bankrupcy book and the PG book

I told him that the mark to market values are on the forward detail and the option detail
report if you have the post_id.  He said that he does not know that post_id's for these
calcs. I don't have the post_id's either.

I have created a program for him last week and also spend the entire day yesterday
to give him what he needs and it still not what he wants because:
	- the post_ids that the program pick up is wrong.
	- values are duplicated because it uses several post ids
	- values are missing because it is the wrong post ids

Russell said that I have to provide the post_ids for these calcs.
I told him I can not do that because I don't know the post_ids either.

O'Neal, I will be getting with you tomorrow or Friday about how these look in Tagg and Sitara.  Also, the 11 deals that I tested yesterday, I will need you to check them out as well.  Thanks for your help.

We have just decided to divide the western region into two groups.  I will be heading up the Rockies/NW and Northern California, while Phillip Allen heads up the Southwest and Southern California.  Think about whether or not you  would like to change how you serve our groups going forward.  We will need to divide the curve files to reflect the separate regions.  The Southwest will be defined as EP SJ and EP Permian.  P&L summary reports will be separated into two groups.

Hey,

I keep hearing negative things about Lord of the Rings. Any desire to see In
the Bedroom. It's a thriller with Sissy Spacek. I've heard good things about
it. Or The Shipping News with Kevin Spacey. This is a drama. I think I'd
prefer the thriller myself.

In the Bedroom is playing at the Edwards near you at 1:30pm.

What do you think?

You still have access to test - the data is just old - but strangely won't effect you too much.   Doubt it will be refreshed - due to production being the priority.   

Stephanie will set you up in the new production by the end of the day.  Don't get too excited - it all looks the same.  
All the programming effort has been put on the website.

You will have access soon - Stephanie will send you your ID's and passwords.

We have a lot of work to do in there - so we don't want everyone in there quite yet.  The problem is - if traders are playing with the products while we are trying to re-build the products and data elements with UBS names - we are going to have issues.

The other thing I want to make sure everyone understands - this is our new production data base - not a test data base.  
There are a limited number of authorized users assigned to "testing" or playing around with the data - and they are responsible for cleaning it up too.   
We will allow people to play for the simulation only.

Once we finish building our UBS production data base - we will the copy it to our test data base - and resume our bridge testing from there to the other test environments (our test environment still has the old Enron data).

Kam - please advise.  Also, keep in mind that I just created these books in risktrac today using "PERFORMANCE" as the book id and will have to re-create them due to the name change.  This "PERFORMANCE" book must be an old book that was created in ERMS but not Risktrac.

Before I reply to all, the shortname "PERFORMANCE" is already used on another record, do you have another preference?  I just added "BK" just to get the record in the system, but it can be changed.

I set up 3 curve names yesterday. Can you see that they are included in the GD settles? They are:

GDP-TENN/Z5
GDP-DOM(DEL)
GDP-COLGAS/DEL

These are all in the citygate section. Let me know if I need to do anything else to make this happen. Thanks.

Andrew,

I forgot a name.  Also, as Kam pointed out below, can we make sure that the set-up users have access to the web page as well.

Attached you will find the new books that have been set up for UBS Energy.  There are some books that do not have a trader name attached.  These books will be inactive until a trader is assigned at a later date.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

As a follow up to this email, we will start reporting the DPR's on Wednesday's and Monday's, for Tuesday and Friday valuations.  The first Wednesday will be the 30th of January.  Each day we should expect to report the positions, P&L and PRMA of only those transactions we expect to fulfill.  With the exception of Gas, Susan Trevino will be sending the benchmarks to each of the groups for their review.  
 
If anyone anticipates any problems with this time frame, please call me or Shona to discuss.

Fallon has requested a DPR be prepared 2X a week for positions that we are executing on (active/live positions only, no terminations or deals we are not executing on).  We have put together the shell of how this DPR will look.  To start this process we are planning to present to him positions (column E) and PRM value (column X) as of 1/23.  To do this, we have laid out the following steps:
 
- we need to get the PRM values directly from you (column X)
- we will run the benchmarks and need to work with you to ensure you are happy with the benchmark numbers we have pulled from RMS (the exception is gas, we need the gas risk group to provide the gas bench to us)
- we need all of then exceptions/qualifications to your numbers
- we will need the other information in the schedule to be reported to us starting next week, but not for this exercise
 
Please confirm to me/Shona that you can get us this info by 230 pm today.
 
Lastly, I am attaching the unofficialized book list as these books will not make it into the benchmarks and need you to confirm that there are no 3rd party positions in these books.
 
Thanks in advance

Kam,
Attached is a list of all the curves I upload.  All of mine are volatility curves so I included the curve type and risk type.

We need to take the central off before the NY, NY Market, southeast curve files.  We need to add the GDI East curve file.  Also add the two east phy/gas daily curve files - o:tds/tds curve/east/intramonth & gas daily files/eastprodnewstyle and eastmktnewstyle.  Sandra's curve file is o:tds/tds curve/east/fteast.  The P&L files are o:erms/1intra/ireport/2002/0102phy/regions/EATP0102 and o:erms/erms_adm/firmtrad/2002/0102/regions/Intra-East Transport 0102.

Are there any other files/directories that the estate people in risk will need to use to do their jobs.  IT will have to go into each macro and change the database that it is using to the new one they are creating this weekend.  I don't know if any of you are still using any exotic spreadsheets other than the transport model.  Please let me know if there is anything I'm missing.  (curve files)

Here are the files that use ERMS that the estate will be using.
