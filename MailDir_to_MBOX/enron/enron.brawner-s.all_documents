Well Ray as you might as well have guessed your timing does suck.  All this 
time has gone by and the day Enron does a "deal" with Natsource, you decide 
we should have a drink and share a meal.  You guys will never cease to amaze 
me.

Jeff,
I needed to apologize for my inability to handle myself in more of a 
professional manner.  I thought I had moved on from being an emotional basket 
case , but as we found out, I haven't..  Again , please accept my apology.  I 
just need to move forward and stop reflecting on the past.  It is  so  
difficult when you have given your entire career for an organization that 
still doesn't see value in you.  But, that is my problem not yours.

In regards to your party , your right, I laughed at the invitation - (It is 
so Shankman)  - Sorry I will not be able to attend. But thanks for asking.

And lastly, Wes Walton how?  2001 Candy Apple Ferrari !!!

Steve,

 My opinion of your organization and the way they chose to handle themselves 
in a stressful situation, is such that I prefer not to have any business 
dealings with anyone in the entire organization.  I am sure that Matt and 
Darryl are good people and good brokers.  The bottom line is ( I do not 
believe you are getting)  that I do not want to, and do not plan to do 
business with Natsourse today or in the future.

                           Learn the ins and outs of filing after mid-April 
deadline 

                           By GARY KLOTT 
                           Tribune Media 

                           For the many millions of individuals who have yet 
to file their 2000 income tax returns, there is no
                           reason to panic. 

                           If you need more time to file your return, you can 
easily get a filing extension. 

                           And if you can't afford to pay your tax bill now, 
you can buy more time to pay up. While you may be
                           subject to interest and penalties for payments 
made after April 16, you can put off the day of
                           reckoning for months without fear that IRS 
collection agents will come after you. There is even a
                           loophole in the law that will enable many 
individuals to get an extra month to pay up without being
                           assessed interest or penalties. 

                           Nevertheless, April 16 is a critical deadline for 
anyone who has yet to file his tax returns. You'll need
                           to file either your tax return or an extension 
request by the deadline. And to avoid interest and
                           penalties, you'll generally need to pay any taxes 
owed by April 16. 

                           April 16 is also the deadline for making IRA 
contributions for 2000 returns and for making the first
                           installment of quarterly estimated taxes for 2001. 

                           Filing extension: If you'd like more time to file 
your return, getting a filing extension is simple. In fact,
                           the IRS has expanded the options this year for 
obtaining a filing extension. You can now do it by
                           phone, computer or mail. 

                           The traditional way to get an extension is to fill 
out IRS Form 4868, "Application for Automatic
                           Extension of Time to File U.S. Individual Income 
Tax Return" and mail it to the IRS by the April 16
                           deadline. If you're using tax-preparation software 
or a tax professional, you can file your extension
                           request by computer. Or you can phone in your 
extension request by calling 888-796-1074. 

                           If you owe the IRS money, another option for 
requesting an extension is to make the payment by
                           credit card (American Express, Discover or 
MasterCard) on the Internet or by phone through one
                           of the two companies the IRS has authorized for 
processing credit card payments. Details on the
                           option are included in the Form 4868 instructions. 

                           By making the extension request, the IRS will 
automatically give you four more months, until Aug.
                           15, to file your return. 

                           You can get an extension for any reason. No 
explanation is asked for when requesting an extension. 

                           But be aware that your extension request only 
gives you extra time to file your return, not to pay
                           your taxes. To avoid interest and possible penalty 
charges, you must estimate how much you owe
                           and make the payment with your extension request 
by the April 16 deadline. 

                           Unable to pay: If you can't afford to pay your tax 
bill, you should at least file an extension request by
                           the April 16 deadline. 

                           Though you'll be subject to interest and possible 
penalty charges for late payment of your taxes,
                           you'll avoid being hit with a late-filing penalty, 
which runs a steep five percent a month (up to a
                           maximum 25 percent.) 

                           Installment plan: If you still don't have the cash 
to pay your taxes by the time your extension runs out
                           on Aug. 15, you can negotiate with the IRS to pay 
your balance due in monthly installments. You
                           make the request for an installment agreement when 
you file your completed tax return using Form
                           9465, "Installment Agreement Request." 

                           "Offer in compromise": If you can't afford to pay 
all you owe in taxes, even in installments over a
                           period of years, you may be able to work out a 
settlement with the IRS. The IRS recently expanded
                           its "Offer in Compromise" program, in which 
taxpayers in tough financial situations can offer to settle
                           for less than they owe. Offers are submitted using 
IRS Form 656, "Offer in Compromise." 

                           A loophole offers an extra month to pay up: If all 
you need is an extra month or so to come up with
                           the cash to pay your tax bill, there is a way you 
may be able to get a short reprieve without being
                           subject to interest or penalties. 

                           All you need do is take the IRS up on its offer to 
calculate your tax bill for you. 

                           If you're eligible for the offer, fill out your 
tax return, stopping short of computing certain totals, and
                           send it in by April 16. The IRS will compute your 
tax and send you a bill for any tax owed. If you
                           pay within 30 days of the notice, you won't be 
assessed any penalties or interest. 

                           To take advantage of the loophole, your taxable 
income must be less than $100,000 and you can't
                           itemize deductions. The full list of eligibility 
requirements and step-by-step instructions are contained
                           in IRS Publication 967, "The IRS Will Figure Your 
Tax." 

                           Retirement account contributions: If you hope to 
contribute to an Individual Retirement Account, the
                           final deadline for 2000 tax-year contributions is 
April 16, even if you obtain a filing extension. 

                           The deadline is more flexible for self-employed 
retirement plans. Contributions to Keogh or
                           Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) plans can be 
made up until the due date of your return, which
                           can be later than April 16 with a filing 
extension. 

                           Estimated tax deadline: For self-employed workers 
and other individuals who need to make
                           quarterly estimated tax payments to the IRS, April 
16 also is the deadline for making the first
                           installment for 2001.

i think part of the problem is only physical jobs are available at enron 
running your own book is something they just dont hire outside the office 
very often.
of course this is the gas side only

My bible study lasted until 9:00.  I was exhausted.  I had been on the phone
all day.  I am working this career thing very hard.  I am leaving in the
morning for Tulsa to look at houses and apartments.  I have not excepted the
job yet.  I have to be sure.  I also have some interviews set up for Monday
and Tuesday of next week.

I have to have faith that God will lead me in the right direction.

I have to call Susan and Jon and apologize.

What is Jon's phone number at work?

Pam

To all,

I visited with Kam earlier today to revisit the positions in the SE book and 
we discovered the following:

City of Madison transport: transfer to Pete's book for 10/01 and forward
MGAF transport:  write down 2007-2020 position.  Loss of about $500K - Scott 
as we spoke, I'll take the blame
LRC/Stringray positions:  Kam to review and explain
Annuity:    Origination total of about 90K, net with 500 loss from above
Alagasco:   Tammi deal, Sonat Tier 2 position
Others:    As I explained to Kam, any gain from closing this book should be 
transferred for the
    account of Jared Kaiser
            Bank of America
           ABA 0011.....just kidding!  It comes from sitting by Sandra too 
long.

Kam - thanks for your help and let me know if you need my help.  As well, 
please reply if I have not covered all issues.


Regards,

Jared

Sandra,
???? 
???? The email that you sent me last Thursday has bothered me the entire 
weekend.? That is why I am emailing you from home.? I just want you to know 
my true intention of the email I sent you that day.
???? First and foremost,?I invited you and Kenny out for drinks, or a dinner, 
as friends.? I repeat,?"as friends" and nothing more.? I said in that email 
that business does not have to be discussed and?I meant it.? As far as 
the?Enron/Natsource?"deal" that you are talking about.....it had nothing to 
do with the email I sent you.? As far as I know, that "deal" has been in the 
works since September/October between Jack Cogan and Andy Zipper.? So I want 
it to be clear to you that the "deal" had nothing to do with me sending you 
that email.
???? As a matter of fact, the reason why I sent you that email and invited 
you out was because of the last time we spoke.? Remember when I instant 
messaged you?? The reason why I approached you that way was because I thought 
we were close enough friends that I could.? As?I found out, I was wrong.? 
However, when I spoke to you that day, on the phone, and asked if I could ask 
you out in the future ( when?I come to Houston).....you said I could.? I have 
planned to come down for weeks.? Even though you choose to not deal with 
Natsource, I still considered you a?friend and thought it would be 
appropriate to ask you out.....and so?I did.
???? As you know, I take things to heart.? I was really upset with 
the?response I got from you.? I am emailing you from home because it bothered 
me so much that I needed to make sure you understood my true intentions.? I 
hope I have done that.
???? Finally, I just want to say that I will not bother you again.? I just 
want you to know that?I have always tried to do the right thing.? I feel as 
though you are questioning everything I say or do and that you believe there 
are?ulterior motives behind my actions.....and it just isn't true!??With 
that, I wish nothing but good things for you and your family.
?
???? good bye,
???????????????? Ray?

NewPower to offer another pilot program to Houston employees


Free remote energy management solution helps you to manage rising energy 
bills.
NewPower is launching a revolutionary technology pilot to the first 500 
people to sign up in the Houston area.  The NewPower Connections Remote 
Energy Management Solution is a pilot program designed to give consumers 
control of their thermostat via the Internet.  The program will allow 
thermostats to be adjusted from anywhere, with any Internet-enabled device, 
including computers, web-enabled cell phones, palm OS devices, or pocket 
PCs.  Sears Home Central will install and service the Remote Energy 
Management Solution at no charge throughout the duration of the pilot 
program.  For a typical household, the three-month pilot could result in up 
to 10 percent to 15 percent utility bill savings, based on personal usage and 
the size of your home.  


Be among the first to participate absolutely free.
Enrollment with the NewPower Connections Remote Energy Management Solution 
pilot program starts May 14 and continues through the end of the month.  For 
more information about this offer, visit NewPower's table located in the 
Plaza of the Enron Building near the down escalator from 11:00 a.m. to 2 p.m. 
during the week of May 14.  To become a pilot participant you need only to be 
a homeowner in the Houston area and have Internet access.  You do not even 
have to be a NewPower electricity customer to participate.  For more 
information about NewPower Connections, send an e-mail to 
connections@newpower.com.


Disclaimers:
Any contract for goods or services that is entered into by an Enron employee 
with respect to the NewPower program shall be solely between NewPower and 
such employee.  Enron assumes no obligation on behalf of NewPower and makes 
no representations, warranties, or guaranties with respect to NewPower, any 
goods or services offered or provided by NewPower.  Home.Enron.com

Well Ray as you might as well have guessed your timing does suck.  All this
time has gone by and the day Enron does a "deal" with Natsource, you decide
we should have a drink and share a meal.  You guys will never cease to
amaze me.

 Organization Announcement (Correction) 

I apologize for the confusion and inconvenience my mistake caused.  I had 
indicated that Kenneth Lovejoy would be supporting EES, but this is not 
correct.  Ken will be supporting  OEC.  Corrected announcement is provided 
below. 

 It is my pleasure to announce that Kenneth Lovejoy has joined Enron Corp. 
EH&S Asset Operations.  He will be reporting directly to Donnie Willmann and  
will support Central America, Caribbean and OEC.  Ken has over 25 year 
experience in environmental, health and safety for the oil and gas 
industry.   He has been working for Enron since 1996 and has extensive 
international experience.    We are excited to have Ken in our team so, 
please welcome Ken in his new role.

Henry  Van

Introducing your first SAP Paycheck!

This is the first payroll processed in SAP for all employees paid out of=20

reflected on your pay advice, the most common are itemized below.

What=01,s Different?
? Your =01+home=01, cost center will be displayed at the top of the pay adv=
ice.=20
This is your department number as designated in the HR and financial module=
s=20
of SAP.

? Any earnings descriptions that start with a =01+P=01, represent earning t=
ypes=20

advice as =01+PVacation=01,.

? Flex dollars will appear on the earnings section of the pay advice instea=
d=20
of as a credit in the deduction section. The various benefit deductions wil=
l=20
remain itemized in the deduction section.

? If you transfer between Enron companies during the year, your year=01)to-=
date=20
totals will carry forward to the new company pay advice. Previously, the=20
year-to-date totals started over when transferred to another company. This=
=20
change will provide your total Enron earnings and deduction amounts on your=
=20
pay advice throughout the year.  (Note that your W2 at the end of the year=
=20
will reflect your earnings by company).

? For salaried employees, any reported exception time (e.g. vacation, sick=
=20
day, etc.) will be reflected on the earnings section with hours only, the=
=20
related dollar amount will be included in the =01+Salary=01, earnings type.=
=20

? For any other information or further explanations regarding your payroll=
=20
contact the Payroll Call Center at 713-345-5555



Payroll FAQ=01,s

My paycheck has a line called =01&other deductions=018, what does that stan=
d for?
There is a fixed amount of lines to print deductions on the paycheck.  For=
=20
some employees, the number of deductions are more than we have room to=20
print.  In this circumstance, the system totals all remaining deductions an=
d=20
prints them on one line =01) titled =01&other deductions=018.  The detail o=
f all=20
deductions can be viewed on the pay advice that is displayed on the intrane=
t=20
at eHRonline.enron.com.

What do the earnings or deduction codes on my paycheck mean?
These definitions are listed on the Payroll webpage located at=20
hrweb.enron.com, select Enron Payroll  from the side index.

Why is my overtime not reflected on my paycheck?
Overtime is paid one pay period in arrears, therefore it will be reflected =
in=20
the next pay period. For example, if you reported overtime for the=20
July 1st =01)15th pay period, it will be reflected on your July 31st pay ad=
vice=20
as =01+POvertime=01,.

What is the limit for Social Security (FICA)?
For year 2000 the limit is $4,724.40 on a wage base of $76,200. This limit =
is=20
applied to each Enron payroll tax company. Therefore, if you transfer to=20
another Enron company these limits will start over, however, the total amou=
nt=20
withheld across all companies will be reflected on your paystub. Excess FIC=
A=20
will be credited to you by the IRS via your tax return.

What federal income tax rate is used for my bonus or when I exercise stock=
=20
options?
There is a standard federal income tax rate of 28% for these earnings. This=
=20
can be higher if the employee has completed a Supplemental Tax form=20
requesting a higher rate (this form can be found at hrweb.enron.com , selec=
t=20
Enron Payroll  from the side index).

I appreciate your note and yes it has been awhile since we spoke.  I do chat 
with Ray occasionally.  Steve without sounding abrupt I still have no 
intention of doing business with your shop.  That situation was difficult  
for several of us involved, and it is not something  that I believe I will 
forget. nor understand.  


Sincerely,

Sandra

you have been there, drapes , chairs, decorations, etc - and I LOVE IT- I 
cant wait to show you.  
 And FYI   _ - I MISSED YOU - You can never never go away that long again.

I am working with the EOL system development group on improving the reporting 
capabilities of EOL so that Internal EOL traders can personalised and save 
report formats.  Currently the system only saves the last report format.  If 
you have any ideas, thoughts or requests please let me know.
I have attached a file with examples of reports that can be generated.  The 
goal would be to give you the ability to view the information when you need 
it and in the required format.

Dear Sandra,

I sincerely apologize if I offended you in any way Wednesday evening.  That
was certainly never my intention. I let my competitive emotions take over. I
was attempting to compare myself with other brokers not any specific shop.
If I singled certain brokers out that was not my intention.  I was honestly
trying to stress that I really work hard to earn the business.

I can truly say that I slept very little that night reflecting on things
that were discussed in our dinner.  After pondering the discussion about the
firmness of physical gas, I was afraid that I did not communicate my point
well and insulted your intelligence and your ability to judge the
intelligence of your brokers.  I certainly would never purposely do that. I
respect your reputation in the market and your knowledge of the market. Upon
reflection of the conversation, I did not communicate my points concerning
physical, and I cannot say enough that it was not my intention to insult you
(whether you work at Enron or not).

I have reviewed the conversation with Steve and Jon (Ray is at lunch), and I
can honestly say I was trying to point out Enron's strength in the
marketplace.  I chose the West as the example because of the volatility.  I
certainly meant it on how the market has changed; NOT how Enron manipulates
the market or is putting traders out of jobs.

I am embarrassed that I lost my composure.  I felt you were trying to
challenge our group to raise our level of game (which you did).  I did not
mean to dominate the conversation from Natsource's point of view.  Steve and
I agreed that we both could have handled the discussions much better.  I do
not blame Steve as my boss or Jon as the desk head for not stopping the
conversation.  I am an adult and a professional so I take full
responsibility. As brokers, our job is to communicate.  Clearly, we failed
in this regard.

I obviously would like to make it up to you and your firm.  I hope my lack
of composure does not cost my entire firm any of Enron's business.  I hope I
can work through the issues I created for the Gulf desk.  I will take it
personally to take your points about our desk and make them happen.  I do
not want you uncomfortable with anyone who speaks with you.  Your respect
for Ray is obvious, and I will try to support whatever you decide to the
fullest.


Sincerely,

Aaron

Sandra,

No need to apologize.  If there is anything I can do career wise for you, 
please don't hesitate to ask.  (Don't think of as one or two people as the 
entire organization).

Next time I'll give you more notice on the next cocktail party...

Funny about Wes, I had already bought a Ferrari, Aston Martin, Lamborghini, 
Porsche (turbo), and a Bentley.   He's such a follower.

Jeff,
I needed to apologize for my inability to handle myself in more of a 
professional manner.  I thought I had moved on from being an emotional basket 
case , but as we found out, I haven't..  Again , please accept my apology.  I 
just need to move forward and stop reflecting on the past.  It is  so  
difficult when you have given your entire career for an organization that 
still doesn't see value in you.  But, that is my problem not yours.

In regards to your party , your right, I laughed at the invitation - (It is 
so Shankman)  - Sorry I will not be able to attend. But thanks for asking.

And lastly, Wes Walton how?  2001 Candy Apple Ferrari !!!

Susan, 
We had the best time.  Good friends, great experiences, weather , etc.  Now 
we all want to move to  Denver.  I am glad that Bens outfit worked out so 
well.
I thought it was cute and I could picture him wearing it when I purchased 
it.  So-------are you still planning the retreat weekend?  I am soooo 
jealous.  I would love to go but as I said I can not justify the expense.  
Any consideration to something a little more modestly priced?  Do you already 
have the plans made?  
Call me or write me back.   Hey - I am getting more and more excited about 
NYC.

A beautiful woman loved growing tomatoes, but couldn't seem to get her 
tomatoes to turn red. One day while taking a stroll she came upon a 
gentleman neighbor who had the most beautiful garden full of huge red 
tomatoes. 

The woman asked the gentleman, "What do you do to get your tomatoes so 
red?" The gentleman responded, "Twice a day I stand in front of my tomato 
garden and expose myself, and my tomatoes turn red from blushing so much." 

 The woman was so impressed, she decided to try doing the same 
 thing to her tomato garden to see if it would work. So twice a day for two 
weeks she exposed herself to her garden hoping for the best 

  One day the gentleman was passing by and asked the woman, "By the way, 
How did you make out? Did your tomatoes turn red?" 

"No" she replied, "but my cucumbers are enormous!"

Big Smile -  Well I guess if I had to be honest he is unique in the market 
place.   I found him very interesting and confusing all at the same time.
It would be nice to have a beer one day and catch up on old times.  Take care

Jeff,

Just a quick note to say "thank you" for your comments at year end.  I 
sincerely appreciated your comments and support.
I hope your Holidays were safe, healthy, and happy.  Say when am I going to 
see that new home of yours?  You know it is hard to continue to live 
vicariously through you if I don't know what to picture!

I certainly can respect your decision.  I hope you will change your mind
concerning the Gas Daily market.  Darryl Dworkin and Matt Handler have
worked that market for us for 4 years.  They have completely different
styles and personalities than the Gulf desk (actually more like Ray).

I hope that you will meet with these guys and then make your decision.  I
would hate to have that dinner cost Darryl and Matt an opportunity to work
with you.  I think they have always worked well with Enron.  Obviously, your
decision rules.

Thanks Again for the time,

Steve

Steve,

I have likewise done alot of reflecting about our dinner and the events
that followed.  As of now I have no plans to do business with Natsourse.
You need to also be aware that this will include Gulf Coast Basis and Gas

The SITARA system was brought down Monday night (12/4/00) for 4 hours for  
required maintenance.

This additional maintenance time as well as the normal nightly processing may 
delay the availability
of some portfolios early Tuesday morning. 

 The expected time for completion of priming portfolios for Tuesday is 
between 6:30 and 7:00 AM.

CPR will be available during this time.

Please call the SITARA/CPR Hotline ((713)-853-7049) if you have any questions 
or concerns.

Sorry for the delay in getting back to you .  My mom had some surgery last 
week and I was in and out of the office.  Thursday the 21st is not good for 
me.
Kenny is going hunting (birds)  and I will need to be available for the 
children.  Let me know if there is another evening that will work>

Your not here for me to talk to so I thought I would vent through E_MAil.  
Jon it is 9:10 in the morning Thursday and Tom is the ONLY Gulf Amerex broker 
in again.  And I am so challenged that i could scream.   You guys need to get 
your shit together or throw in the towel.  It is certainly all of you guys 
business, but you have no idea how it affects mine.  You used the excuse 
about APB and the Derby, well APB has some customers in town today  and they 
have a full shop this morning.  And they plan to have 75% in tomorrow.  And 
Amerex is having 0% in on Friday.(because of APB's Derby)  are you getting 
the picture?  I love you, but I am getting very tired of defending you guys, 
you all make it harder and harder.

I have really spent alot of time reviewing the situation this weekend.  I
hope you have accepted my apologies and understood my thoughts about what
happened.  As I said, I put myself in your shoes and can understand what you
view is on many of the points.  I hope you could understand some of my
confusion on how the dinner went.

I do not think it will be easy for either group to put it behind us.  I hope
you understand that you are an important customer for us (which is why the
entire gulf desk went to dinner with you) and earning and keeping your
respect is important.  We have a long way to go in that area.

I hope things will be better today.  I am not going to have the Gulf desk
turn on the box until I hear from you.  I apologize that I did not catch the
"box time" on Thursday due to the scattered  schedules the Gulf desk was
keeping along with myself (long conference call); otherwise, you would have
had a call from me when things settled down that day.

Sincerely,

Steve

Please see the following instructions for the new messenging board.  If you 
have any trouble entering into this site, please let me know.  Everyone 
should now be setup and ready to go. You will have to add this site to one of 
your favorites.  

The Gas Message Board application can run on both IE5.0 and IE5.5 now. 

Attached is the URL for user to run the application.

http://gasmsgboard.dev.corp.enron.com

Please feel free to forward above URL to people who like to test the 
application. 

Here is the steps they should do:

1) Launch Internet Explorer

2) Type: http://gasmsgboard.dev.corp.enron.com (or just open this email and 
click on above URL)

3) Users should see the messages if there is any new messages for today. If 
they don't see any messages, there are two reasons: 
 (1) They are not valid users. Their names have not been added into the NT 
Web_GasTraders Group yet. Please contact Chrysti Hardy to add their names 
into the group.
 (2) There is no new messages added yet.

4) Click on "Comments" button to add messages: there will be a popup window 
when user clicks on "comments" button. There are two ways to send the 
messages after typing the 
messages into the text box:
 (1) just simply press enter to send the message. or
 (2) click on "send" button to send the message.

5) After the message has been sent, The message will be displayed on the main 
window immediately, the rest people who are online will get the new message 
in less than 30 seconds. This time can be reduced to as less as 1 second. 
However, I would not recommend to reduce the time interval less than 10 
second.  Because each time the browser refreshes the screen, the screen will 
be blink. Users don't want the screen blink every second while they read the 
messages.

6) All messages will be cleaned up daily at 6:00PM. If they like to clean 
them up later than 6:00PM, please let me know. I can reset the time.

Note: Right now the application is under test environment. If they like it, I 
will move it into production environment soon.

Let me know any feedbacks.

Thanks,

Fangming

I have received your E-Mail .   

Steve, 

I have likewise done alot of reflecting about our dinner and the events that 
followed.  As of now I have no plans to do business with Natsourse.  You need 
to also be aware that this will include Gulf Coast Basis and Gas Dailys.


Thank You

Subject: angel

this is cute.  


  Not long ago and far away, Santa was getting ready for his annual
  trip...but there were problems everywhere. Four of his elves got sick, and
  the trainee elves did not produce the toys as fast as the regular ones so
  Santa was beginning to feel the pressure of being behind schedule.

  Then Mrs. Claus told Santa that her mom was coming to visit. This stressed
  Santa even more.

  When he went to harness the reindeer, he found that three of them were
  about to give birth and two had jumped the fence and were out, heaven
  knows where. More Stress.

  Then when he began to load the sleigh, one of the boards cracked and the
  toy bag fell to the ground and scattered the toys.

  Totally frustrated, Santa went into the house for a cup of coffee and a
  shot of whiskey. When he went to the cupboard, he found the elves had hit
  the liquor and there was nothing to drink. In his frustration, he dropped
  the coffee pot and it broke into hundreds of little pieces all over the
  kitchen floor. He went to get the broom and found that mice had eaten the
  straw it was made from.

  Just then the door bell rang and Santa cussed on his way to the door.

  He opened the door and there was a little angel with a great big Christmas
  tree.

  The angel said: "Where would you like to put this tree fat man?"

  And that my friend, is how the little angel came to be on top of the
  Christmas tree.

You put a smile on my face with your message.... The reading material is no 
big deal - It is some Gas Rags story about Skillings comments.
And your customer is completly happy with her trim - However , She (me) wants 
to be a regular client.

Hey - I just checked my E MAils for the day.  Sorry to hear about the 
interview with AEP.  I really am quite surprised.   Did Kayvon say why they 
didnt want to give you an interview?   I believe your thinking correctly , 
you need to seriously consider the Balitmore job.  And dont forget there is 
that possiblilty with AGL in Houston.  Correct?

Steve,

 My opinion of your organization and the way they chose to handle
themselves in a stressful situation, is such that I prefer not to have any
business dealings with anyone in the entire organization.  I am sure that
Matt and Darryl are good people and good brokers.  The bottom line is ( I
do not believe you are getting)  that I do not want to, and do not plan to
do business with Natsourse today or in the future.

My bible study lasted until 9:00.  I was exhausted.  I had been on the phone
all day.  I am working this career thing very hard.  I am leaving in the
morning for Tulsa to look at houses and apartments.  I have not excepted the
job yet.  I have to be sure.  I also have some interviews set up for Monday
and Tuesday of next week.

I have to have faith that God will lead me in the right direction.

I have to call Susan and Jon and apologize.

What is Jon's phone number at work?

Pam

A Preacher wanted to raise money for his church, and being told that there 
was a fortune in Horse Racing, he decided to purchase a horse and enter him 
in the race.  However, at the local auction the going price for horses was  
so steep that he ended up buying a Donkey instead.  He figured that since he  
had it, he might as well go ahead and enter it in the races, and to his  
surprise, the Donkey came in third. 

The  next day the racing form carried this headline, "Preacher's Ass shows". 
The Preacher was so pleased with the  Donkey that he entered it in the race 
again, and this time it won.  The next day the form said, "Preacher's Ass, 
out in front!"

The Bishop was so upset with this kind of publicity, that he ordered the 
Preacher not to enter the Donkey in another race.  The newspaper printed 
this headline; "Bishop scratches Preacher's Ass." 

This was just too much for the Bishop, and he ordered the Preacher to get rid 
of the animal. The Preacher decided to give it to a Nun in a nearby convent. 
The headline next day read, "Nun has the best Ass in town." 

The Bishop fainted. He informed the Nun that she would have to  
dispose of the Donkey. She finally found a Farmer who was willing to buy 
it for $10. Next day the paper said, "Nun peddles her Ass for ten bucks." 
They buried the Bishop the next day.

Current Notes User:

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook 
client will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail 
via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is 
configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is 
migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your 
web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and 
To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook 
client is configured on your desktop.

2. Remote access to your mailbox.
After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) 
for remote access to your mailbox.

PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while 
connecting to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA 
available from your home or when traveling abroad.

HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  
http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe

Substitute "john.doe" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You 
will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in "corp/your user 
id" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You 
will now be able to view your mailbox.

 

PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between 
the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things 
in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the 
functions NOT available via OWA:

Features NOT available using OWA:

-  Tasks
-  Journal
-  Spell Checker
-  Offline Use
-  Printing Templates
-  Reminders
-  Timed Delivery
-  Expiration
-  Outlook Rules
-  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall
-  Sharing Contacts with others
-  Task Delegation
-  Direct Resource Booking
-  Personal Distribution Lists

QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?

If you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the 
Outlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at:

 Outlook.2000@enron.com

Otherwise, you may contact the Resolution Center at:

 713-853-1411

Thank you,

Outlook 2000 Migration Team

	"How to Kill A  Blonde"
	
	Score: 65
	(posted by Shella on  07/31/00)
	
	One Day, A Blonde walks into a hair salon with  headphones on. The 
Hairstylist said:  
	
	"What would you like done today?"  
	
	The Blonde Answered..."I want to get my hair permed."  
	
	"Well, you're gonna have to remove those headphones first."  answered the 
hairstylist.  
	
	"But I can't! My parents said that if I EVER take them off, I'll  die!" The 
Blonde said  
	
	"Alright, I'm gonna go get the stuff I need, and when I come  back, you 
better have those off." the hairstylist replied. So as she  was walking into 
the backroom, the blonde appempted to take off the  headphones.  
	
	When the hairstylist returned, she found the blonde sprawled out  on the 
floor. She was dead. The hairstylist picked up the headphones  that were 
laying next to her. There was a voice on the headphones  saying:  
	
	"Breathe in, Breathe out, Breathe in, Breathe out, Breathe in,  Breathe 
out."

I really appreciate you taking the time to be professional to me today.  You
could have easily passed on our discussions.

I hope you understand how important these issues are to me.  I have gone
over the entire evening with everyone to make sure I am not leaving a stone
unturned.

Thanks again.  I know we have an uphill battle with you, and I hope we are
up to the challednge.

Thanks,

Steve

It is my great pleasure to announce that the Board has accepted my=20

Jeff will assume the role at a time when the company is hitting on all=20

Our succession plan has been clear for some time.  This has afforded Jeff a=

There are no plans for any other changes in our management team nor broad=

Please join me in congratulating Jeff.  I look forward to a great 2001.

Hello Bill,

It was great to get your note today.  I also think of you often.  Thanks for 
the complements concerning Enron, as always I am very proud of Enron where 
we've been and where it seems we are going.  Work is going well,  Business 
with Prebon is still null.  Has nothing to do with Cathy I think she is a 
great person and a  good broker, it just doesn't seem like they (Prebon) has 
any good information and markets anymore.  It is sad actually, ever since you 
left the group things have never been the same.  YOU made a big difference 
there.

Yes I would love to try and meet with you.  I need more information though.  
Things are kinda hectic here and at home so timing is everything for me these 
days.  Lunch is out of the question.  So we are looking at drinks or dinner.  
the week of the 20th is better.  The week of the 25th is not going to be easy 
cuz it is settlement week.

Pam is doing fine.  Still looking for a job.  Hopefully something will happen 
soon.  She had mentioned that you wrote a note,  I guess I got the impression 
she had replied.  She is a little stressed in trying to get things settled in 
her life so just give her some time.

Included is an updated diagram of the proposed Chase prepay that includes 
Stoneville - please let me know if you have any questions.  With regard to 
Stoneville, Enron Hydrocarbons Marketing Corp. entered into an agreement in 
December 1994 whereby Enron would sell to Mahonia and buy-back from 
Stoneville (Stoneville Aegean Ltd) - a transaction very similar to this 
prepay.  Thanks.

Michael

Last month you received an email about enrolling in the Enron PAC.  The=20
response has been positive. =20
Thank you to those of you that have already enrolled or made a change to yo=
ur=20
current contribution! =20
If you have not had an opportunity to visit the enrollment site, please=20
consider taking a moment to do so.  The link to the website is at the end o=
f=20
this message.

 Some of you may have experienced problems launching the site or enrolling.=
 =20
We apologize for any trouble that you may have had.  The enrollment works=
=20
best in either Internet Explorer or Netscape.  The most frequent problems=
=20
were a result of the Lotus Notes web browser that many employees have=20
installed as a default browser.  If this is your case, please copy and past=
e=20
the link at the end of this message into either Internet Explorer or Netsca=
pe.

As a reminder - Following is the original message regarding the PAC=20
enrollment:

Last year the Enron Political Action Committee (PAC) launched a campaign to=
=20
become a "million dollar PAC".  Enron employees, who provide all of the=20
funding for the PAC, responded and the Enron PAC reached its objective,=20
becoming one of the largest corporate PACs.  This year we face a new=20
challenge.  With the sale of EOG, the announced sale of PGE and normal=20
employee turnover, we have lost a significant number of consistent=20
contributors.  We are seeking your support.  If you are not a member, pleas=
e=20
join.  If you are a member, we hope you will consider increasing your=20
contribution.

The Enron PAC is an essential tool in our effort to promote sound public=20
policy.  Our PAC funds support local, state and federal candidates, of both=
=20
parties, who support open markets, deregulation and customer choice.  Amoun=
ts=20
contributed may be used to make political contributions in connection with=
=20
federal and state elections and are subject to the limits of the Federal=20
Election Campaign Act.  While our PAC has grown thanks to our employee=20
contributions, it still generates just a fraction of the expenditures of=20
those who oppose these ideals.

This year, as always, we face challenges and opportunities for every one of=
=20
our businesses, including such issues as taxation and regulation of=20
e-commerce, electric industry restructuring, regulation of derivatives,=20
international trade and investment legislation, pipeline safety, local and=
=20
state decisions affecting the siting and interconnection of power plants an=
d=20
a variety of environmental and tax issues.  Enron has a long and successful=
=20
track record of supporting and advancing good public policy.  That track=20
record depends on access to and regular communication with, decision makers=
. =20
The PAC provides that access - - it shows policy makers that real voters ca=
re=20
about what they are doing.

One of the best things about Enron is that we don=01,t just take things as =
they=20
are.  We challenge the status quo.  We ask why.  We change things.  The PAC=
=20
helps us do that.  We need you to help the PAC.  Sign up today =01) and ple=
ase=20
consider the following contribution guidelines:

Manager    $500/year
Director     $750/year
Sr. Director/General Manager  $1,000/year
Vice President    $2,500/year
Sr. VP/Managing Director  $3,500/year
Executive Committee   $5,000/year

All contributions are voluntary and these guidelines are merely suggestions=
. =20
You are free to contribute more or less than the guidelines suggested and=
=20
Enron will not favor or disadvantage anyone by reason of the amount of thei=
r=20
contribution or their decision not to contribute.  You may refuse to=20
contribute without fear of reprisal.

Only U.S. citizens and resident-aliens living in the U.S. can contribute to=
=20
the Enron PAC.  Amounts contributed may be used to make contributions in=20
connection with federal and state elections and are subject to the=20
limitations of the Federal Election Campaign Act.  The maximum contribution=
=20
is $5,000 per year per individual.  An individual may not contribute more=
=20
than $25,000 to all federal candidates and committees within a calendar=20
year.  The law requires that Enron report name, address, employer and=20
occupation for every person who contributes over $200/year.

No portion of any contribution is deductible as a charitable contribution f=
or=20
federal income tax purposes.

Thanks for your support!  Sign up now, or revise your current contribution=
=20
level by connecting with the PAC intranet site:

Sandra,

My cousin sent me this.  It is so stupid but it made me laugh.

By the way the orthodontist called me last night.  What is he thinking?  I
was not home thank goodness.  SOLD!!!!!

I am not signed onto instant messenger.  I am doing some research this
morning.  I am really nervous about my interview today.

How was the massage?

Pam

Smiling.  At  your comments about Samantha - yes she did - and yes she is 
amazing.  Our Holidays were wonderful.  Our New Years was no big deal at 
all.  We (Kenny and I)  were a little under the weather and therefore did 
nothing - I  went to bed at 12:01   .   anyway - love to get togther for 
dinner soon.  have aq nice week. 


Think warm thoughts Susan-
Sandra
