Rolling 4 quarters estimate for income and cash

Less focus legal entity, more focus functional groups

Detail quarterly reviews/current estimates for O & M and functional groups

TW needs new financial modeling tool to analyze market data

Focus functional groups on ETS bottom line not just their group/company

Consistency in policies, procedures, schedules, accounting methodology, etc. 
across functions

If I think of others, I will send them.

Subject: 2001 Goals & Objectives

I would like each of you to submit, up the chain of command,  a list (not to 
exceed) 10 items (but at least 3) that you believe  need to be accomplished 
in the year 2001.     Some of these can be group goals and some may be 
personal to you and some may be personal to others in the group.      Some 
may even belong to another group.    I am looking for ideas that will improve 
our organizations, that will improve us, and that will potentially improve 
Enron.    Any and all ideas are desired, and things that relate to Stan's 
list are more than welcome.     I would like ideas by early next week as we 
are trying to get draft input/ideas into Stan before the Holidays.

Speaking of the Holidays, I would like each of you to get to Kathy your 
vacation/"out of the office" schedule over the next several weeks.     I 
would like contact phone numbers and to know who is your substitute if you 
are out and unreachable.   Kathy will publish a list after she gets every 
one's input.

Thanks.

Well, if it's going to be 18 months before the upper floors become available 
to us, should we reconsider?

In an effort to evaluate the feasibility of constructing our existing space 
vs. waiting for the 30's bank, we need to know the timing on the availability 
of EB43, 44, and 45 for the ETS restack. Please respond directly to Rod 
Hayslett (copy me, please).

Thanks for your help!

Attached for your review and comment is a broad outline of a rate proposal to 
Caithness for the construction and operation of the 40-mile lateral to the 
Big Sandy project.  This non-binding proposal was requested by Caithness' 
consultant, George Briden, as a starting point for modeling the economics of 
the project's gas supply and a basis for further discussions aimed at 
designing an appropriate deal structure.  For your information, James 
Centilli calculated the transport rate based on the (+/- 30%) $20.33MM cost 
estimate with a ten-year (contract) amortization.  

I plan to put this in the mail by the close of business tomorrow.  If you 
have any suggestions, please let me hear from you by mid-day.   Thanks.

Please find attached the ETS eCommerce/eBusiness strategy document.  

As there are many definitions associated with eCommerce/eBusiness, pages one 
to four of the document provide us a common definition and understanding to 
be used within ETS.

Page five overviews the statistics of the eCommerce/eBusiness transactions we 
have completed in ETS this year.  Included in the figures are close to three 
million eConfirmations and five million hits to our eInformational postings.

 Pages six to thirteen overview future ETS eCommerce/eBusiness opportunities 
with page nine listing specific goals for 2001.

This document was created with the collaboration of many departments.  The 
rapid pace of technology and the use of that technology in business practices 
will force continued input into this evergreen document.

Please let me know if you have any questions or require further clarification 
on any items contained in the attachment.

Thank you.

Rod,

It was a pleasure to meet you at the Birthday Party for Wendy Cherubini on
Friday, November 17th at the Woodlands Athletic Center. I found our
conversation to be enjoyable and informative.

I would appreciate the opportunity to meet with you to discuss how Thompson
Consulting my be of service to Enron. We offer a broad range of professional
services that I am sure Enron would find of value.

Please let me know when would be best for us to meet and I would try to
accommodate your requirement. If there are others you feel should join us in
the meeting please feel free to invite them and let me know.

but what we look at internally).  I know this is a sensitive issue.

John - thanks for the news release - it looks like a good decision; 
particularly the discontinuance of goddwill amortization.
Rod - this sync's up w what Mr. McGowan had read in the World Herald.

This would be a good process to communicate the information needed for non 
budgeted projects.  What discretionary level to move budgeted dollars did 
Stan give to the VP's.  Anything above that level should be submitted for 
review by this process?

What do you think about using something like this proposal for most of our 
major projects (over $1.0 MM), could even go lower?   This has been proposed 
by Morris specifically for EOTT projects, but there is no reason to exclude 
others.

To all:

Hope this clarifies--

We are currently collating needs data from our interview cycle.
Preliminarily, the interviews confirm our suspicions:
 1. Cost & P/L reporting is the most widely held concern.
 2. Cash flow reporting (treasury, direct & indirect) follows closely.
 3.  There is no easy, readily available solution to FERC reporting.
 4. People have lost ad hoc query functionality with the implementation of 
SAP.

Project Sunrise's reporting charter will be to address these needs in the 
most efficient, cost effective way possible.
That could be through a data warehouse, could be through the FERC SAP module, 
could be through another avenue.
None of us has the answer to the methodology question yet (although we all 
have ideas).

I would prefer to keep the Project Sunrise team focused on the task at hand 
-- sifting through the interview information and developing a work plan.
We have followup interviews to schedule & complete, a data model to build, 
etc. Basically a lot of work on our plates.

However, FERC reporting is clearly a significant need that will be at the 
forefront of any reporting solution.
If our goal is to discuss this need in detail tomorrow, I'm all for it! I 
need the education.
If our goal is to look at progress towards a solution, we should look to 
postpone.
I take responsibility for distracting efforts in progress, but believe the 
delay worthwhile.

One final issue: Sean, the Sensecorp consultant who has been working on the 
project, is in California.
We may want to wait on his participation.

I believe we are all on the same page.

Why wouldn't we?  ETS has a specific gap that needs to be addressed, and we 
need to find the best way to fix it.  I would just be sure not to jump to the 
DW as the solution, unless the ISC has been given ample opportunity to 
propose a solution.  Be sure to go that route, too!

Subject: Re: FERC Data Warehouse  

I feel we should proceed with the Dec 5 meeting, at least to get a better 
understanding of what the data warehouse can do for us related to FERC, and 
maybe determine just how far along it currently is.  The original reason we 
were asked to meet on this issue is that it was thought that a lot of work 
had already been completed and it wouldn't take much to deliver an end 
product. The other attendees, as well as myself, need to understand what this 
can do for us as opposed to a potential solution in SAP.

Subject: Re: FERC Data Warehouse  

I am not sure the statement below from Ozlem is entirely accurate.  In 
addtion to Project Sunrise, I have asked Sheila Howard, who is the lead for 
the financial team in the ISC, to work with the Project Sunrise team to 
understand what your issues are and help determine a solution.  

Let me assure you that whether through the Project Sunrise or the ISC, we are 
working on your issue and it has NOT dropped off the radar screen.  As a 
matter of fact, Project Sunrise had a status meeting today, and this came up 
several times.  I think the only question is "what's the best approach for 
solving it"? 

I will leave it to Dave, as the ETS representative to Project Sunrise, along 
with Sheila, Mark, and the others listed below, to continue to work on a 
solution for the FERC problems.  Dave  - is there any reason NOT to proceed 
with the December 5 meeting under these assumptions?  I would just ask that 
Sheila be included.

Thanks!

Dear FERC-interested representatives,

Due to the current redirection of the data warehouse project (which is now 
part of Project Sunrise), it has been determined that it is best to postpone 
a FERC discussion/analysis until after the  collection of business 
requirements and final scoping of the project.    However, I will be 
recommending that a focus group be designated for FERC.  Thank you for your 
help and patience and I apologize for the upheaval and postponements.

NEW LATIN POP, DANCE AND MIX MUSIC ON NETRADIO.COM

Candy Cintron, NetRadio's Latin music programmer, has been working like
one of Santa's elves on a slate of new Latin music channels. The first,
"Tropical," debuted last month (it's temporarily known simply as "Latin"
on the site). The next two went live yesterday: One is "Romance Latino" -
a
pop and dance channel featuring familiar names like Christina Aguilera,
Selena and Gloria Estefan. The other is "Latino Mix" - a "Top 40"
format featuring an eclectic mix of chart toppers like Ricky Martin and
Alejandro Sanz. Links to all three Latin channels are below.
Watch for two more to arrive in early 2001!

A NEW NETRADIO EXCLUSIVE: Q&A WITH MICHAEL MCDONALD

Driving down a Tennessee highway, solo artist and former Doobie Brothers
front man Michael McDonald dialed up NetRadio for a conversation with
staff writer Steve Marsh. In our exclusive Q&A, McDonald discussed playing
live, his move from L.A. to Nashville, his new album Blue Obsession, the
record label he co-founded with Jeff Bridges, and what it's like to return
to the stage with his fellow Doobies.

ANOTHER EXCLUSIVE: IN THE NETRADIO STUDIO WITH RICHARD MARX

Beyond gigantic 80s hits like "Right Here Waiting" and "Hold On to the
Night," and the relatively quiet career he's had in the 90s, Richard Marx
continues to be in demand as a producer for artists ranging from Lionel
Ritchie to the latest boy bands. (And he's still so cute!) He also
continues his career as a humble adult-contemporary artist (his new album,
"Days in Avalon," was just released on his own label). NetRadio's John
Michaels sat down and talked to Marx about his time at the top of the
charts and his continuing work.

AND YET ANOTHER! IN THE NETRADIO STUDIO WITH CHIP DAVIS

Mannheim Steamroller founder and driving force Chip Davis is among the
pioneers of neo-classical electronic music, and with his independent label
American Gramaphone, he helped give rise to the New Age music phenomenon.
His path to his current post with his Grammy-winning group Mannheim
Steamroller included many sidetracks, from teaching music and writing
advertising jingles. Davis talked to NetRadio programmer Jane Fredericksen
about his impact on the New Age landscape and Manheim Steamroller's huge
holiday success. http://www.netradio.com/features/chipdavis.html

Rod,

I mentioned that I have been working on eStrategy.  I thought I would share 
with you my contributions.  The Word doc is a template that is partially 
filled in with my ideas (in blue).  Slides 6-8 are my attempt to condense my 
ideas into a couple of diagrams and e-Strategy statement.  I have worked 
primarily with Mike Sullivan on this but several others have played a 
reviewer role so far.  Of course, this is very preliminary but I thought you 
may find it interesting as you have always enjoyed technology.

Reactive Power Capability Challenges Future Transmission
By Michael J. Zimmer
Baker & McKenzie
Washington, D.C.

A significant challenge to the transmission providers reported by the
National Electric Reliability Council (NERC) will be to maintain adequate
levels of reactive support for the transmission system in the era of open
market competition in the U.S.  Unlike real power (MW), the reactive
component of power (Mvar) cannot be easily transmitted over longer distances
and must generally be supplied at the local level.  Without adequate
reactive power support, portions of the electric power system can be
susceptible to potential voltage collapse or instability according to NERC.
Sources of reactive power include generators, synchronous condensers,
transmission lines, capacitors, and very specialized reactive support
devices generally known as static var compensators (SVCs).  Demand for
reactive power is shaped by the size and type of demand, power transactions
across the transmission system, and the loading of transmission facilities.
This demand for reactive power is growing nationwide.

Decline in Reactive Improvements

Many electric utilities made concerted efforts to improve reactive support
as demand grew by adding shunt capacitors on their distribution and
subtransmission systems, NERC reports.  However, such distribution reactive
improvement programs have declined in recent years within the industry.
Reactive support programs must be continuous as demand on the distribution
system continues to escalate.  A chief component of that growth in the need
for reactive improvement has been air conditioning which particularly
requires increasing levels of reactive support.  Most air conditioner demand
is motor load, requiring significant reactive power support.  Because of its
interaction with the transmission system, reactive support is one area that
distribution companies must not ignore if reliability is to be maintained on
the bulk transmission system.

The physics of transferring power across a transmission line causes it to
consume reactive power, with increased transfers resulting in escalating
voltage decline across the line.  When heavy power transfers occur across a
transmission system interface and transmission lines are heavily loaded,
voltage in the area of the interface can become depressed if sufficient
reactive supplies are not available to the system, NERC has stated.

Open Access Impacts

When transfers of power follow a consistent directional pattern, it is
relatively easy to plan and justify costs for the required reactive support
for the transfers.  For example, significant reactive support was added on
the bulk system to enable higher transfers from ECAR to MAAC and the VACAR
subregion of SERC in the early 1990s.  However, under open access
transmission, transactions are conducted in large numbers across long
distances, and often flow in directions that were not anticipated when the
transmission system was originally planned and built.  The direction and
amount of such transfers has become much more volatile, changing daily, and
sometimes hourly.  Consequently, planning reactive support enhancements for
improving transfer capability has become more difficult as the pace and
level of transactions have become more short-term and real-time.

There is currently no incentive to increase the levels of reactive support
on the bulk power system, NERC states.  In fact, there are disincentives,
because generators are paid to produce real power, not reactive power under
current contracting.  There is a tradeoff between producing real and
reactive power because reactive power generation decreases as the real
output increases.  A recent spate of nuclear unit upgrades effectively
lowered the units' reactive power output capabilities as the real output of
these nuclear units was increased.

In the long term, transmission providers must reevaluate their bulk power
systems in light of open access, including planning for necessary reactive
support.  Business is increasing on the transmission system, but very little
is being done to increase the load serving and transfer capability of the
bulk transmission system.  This will be essential for supporting development
of regional transmission organizations (RTO).  Most of the transmission
projects planned over the next ten years are intended to reinforce parts of
the system to alleviate local problems.

Future Planning Opportunities

This raises several issues for future planning:

* Can distributed generation become a new market source for reactive
power capability?
* Can distributed generation become a source of reliable transmission
loading relief avoidance?
* Is there a third party, competitive market for reactive power?  Is
there a merchant reactive power plant market to avoid voltage reduction
which should be encouraged?
* Who manages this critical bulk power system issue in a
post-restructured world?  Generators? Transmission? Distributors? Marketers?
* Will this issue become impaired further with distribution company
mergers and consolidations?
* Will most new transmission gravitate to reinforce the system for
local problems management, because of a lack of RTO's and strong regional
siting?  Are independent system operator's doing enough to manage this
challenge?
* Is this another incentive for the power quality market to respond?

The ability to transfer electric energy across interfaces or seams hampers
reactive power support.  NERC believes it is a national imperative that
reactive power improvements keep pace with the demands being placed on the
transmission systems to maintain reliability.  We are already seeing this as
an element of key market disruptions.  Reactive power support must
ultimately be placed and coordinated among generation, transmission and
distribution.  With existing regulatory structures, this could be falling in
the cracks with open access transmission, widely varying flow patterns and
associated reactive demands have become commonplace and need accommodation.
The reactive power support system will need to become more versatile for
open access transmission objectives to be achieved, and needs further
attention in the RTO formation process for RTO's to be successful and
thrive.

****

DID YOU KNOW?

* According to recent reports by the Edison Electric Institute, the
level of transmission investment in the U.S. has declined for over 20
successive years.

* The number of transmission load relief postings has escalated since
1998, transmission congestion is up 40% in 1998-9; and 140% in 1999-2000.

F.Y.I.

Please see below how Jim manually voted.

Do you want a machine recount plus a manual recount of the votes so that you 
have a chance to compare the EOTT template to the ETS IT template?

seems to address all important considerations. i would vote (manually) for a 
consistent apporach across all ETS managed activities. however i think it 
will receive resistence by selected project engineers - who tend to anly take 
respeonsiblity for a single facet of a project and not the whole project; and 
may think it slow down an already slow approval process

What do you think about using something like this proposal for most of our 
major projects (over $1.0 MM), could even go lower?   This has been proposed 
by Morris specifically for EOTT projects, but there is no reason to exclude 
others.

Subject: Re: Accounting for plane usage in year 2001  

We are still working on the plane, and the answer is that the plane will be 
billed to the RC reserving it for the flight.    If commercial wants to take 
it to a lower level than that it will be up to them to do so.     It will 
take some actual doing on our side to make this happen, but it can be 
done.     The budget will be taken care of in Planning as we go through the 
year.      From an ETS point of view all of the plane is in Commercial or 
Executive (Stan) and so it should not be a problem to track the budget.   
Tracy has the point on this one.

Jim Saunders:    What do you know about the other comments?

Rod--

I never heard back from you on this airplane accounting issue for year 2001.  
Any thoughts on timing as to who we can work with to finalize by year end?   
Can we work with Dave Waymire here in Omaha??

Also,  there was an article in  this past  Sunday's World Herald that   FASB 
has reversed its position on merger accounting and will not require firms to 
amortize Goodwill  over time and  write it off against current income of a 
merged company.  In addition, the new plan would eliminate the  "pooling of 
interest"  restrictions and allow merged companies to sell off unwanted 
assets prior to the two year waing period now required.  I'm not sure if this 
revision would be applicable to mergers which occurred before this FASB 
revision or not.  

Do you have any insights on this???

Thank You.

Subject: Accounting for plane usage in year 2001

Rod - we have discussed the accounting for plane uasage on year 2001 and have 
determined that  the actual trip costs will be billed direct to the user's 
RC.  However,  the 2001 budget costs for the plane have been included in Dan 
McCarty's executive RC budget.  Thus, we will have to develop a procedure to 
charge the RC for atctual costs, but credit the plane budget and maintain 
some control as to the overall status of the budget.

Who would you like me to work with to develop/coordinate these procedures?

Thanks!

You are invited to attend a "brief" ETS PRC review meeting on Monday, 
December 11.  

One purpose of this meeting is to review the performance distribution in each 
ETS Division (i.e., percentage of employees at each performance level) to 
ensure comparability across the organization.  Human Resources will provide 
performance distribution charts to each of you for your organizations based 
on the results of your PRC meetings.

The second purpose is to review the performance ratings of the Managers and 
Directors/Sr. Directors in your organization, particularly focusing on those 
individuals being recommended for promotion.  Ratings will be reviewed for 
all, but a detailed discussion of each individual's performance is not 
intended.  

The hoped for outcome of this meeting is to reach consensus prior to, and 
minimize surprises during, the final ETS PRC meeting scheduled for December 
15.  This will allow us to focus the majority of that meeting on the 
performance of ETS' Officers.  

Meeting details:
When:  December 11
Where:  EB49C2
Time:  11:00 AM-3:00 PM (lunch will be served)

Subject: Re: FERC Data Warehouse


FERC Background:
When Sensecorp was hired to install the ACTA Rapidmarts, Enron requested a 
FERC Rapidmart which had not yet been defined by ACTA.  In order to fulfill 
Enron's requirements, Sensecorp hired a FERC expert, Sean O'Reilly to assist 
us in defining and developing a FERC Rapidmart.  At the time that Sean 
structured the Rapidmart he stated that the FERC information did not appear 
to reconcile with FI appropriately and that some changes in SAP were probably 
required to ensure that the information was correct.  Also before Sean left, 
he demonstrated to some Enron business representatives the functionality that 
would be available in the FERC Rapidmart but that the information would still 
need to be investigated and appropriately reviewed.

Project Sunrise:
At the time that Project Sunrise was initiated and there appeared to be some 
downtime for the Sensecorp developers, I approached Beverly Fennessy to 
contact FERC business representatives to review the FERC information and 
determine if it could be used with a few minor changes.  ( I was hoping that 
we might be able to quickly complete something that might be of use to the 
business)  We then set up a meeting with the FERC representatives to review 
the data.  

FERC Review:
However, as myself and Scott Brudner reviewed the information, we discovered 
that we are not FERC experts, and all the value that we would be able to 
provide in a meeting is to demonstrate the tables that were selected and the 
structure of the data.   We would not be able to explain FERC, how the module 
worked, or what the information meant.   It seemed that there would not be 
any true benefit in realizing a meeting to review that information - 
especially since we were aware that problems existed in the SAP FERC module 
which we would not be able to explain.  We felt that the only way to have a 
truly productive meeting and progress in the development of FERC was to have 
Sean O'Reilly return and assist us.  However, since Project Sunrise is still 
in the business requirements gathering phase, Beverly thought it was best 
(and I agreed) not to charge further development expenses to the project 
until we were in that phase of the project.  We thought it was best to 
investigate and further develop FERC once the project scope had been defined 
and FERC was included as a priority.   At that point in time we decided to 
cancel the meeting and informed the appropriate parties. 

Business Interest:
As you can tell from the emails below, there is renewed interest in reviewing 
the FERC information and furthering development.  However, Scott and myself 
will not be able to demonstrate FERC functionality to the business anymore 
than was already demonstrated to them by Sean in August.  In order to provide 
true value, we require the assistance of Sean and/or a tremendous amount of 
time to become FERC experts ourselves.  Neither of these items are feasible 
by tomorrow morning.  Please advise how we should proceed.  


Thank you,

Subject: Re: FERC Data Warehouse  

I feel we should proceed with the Dec 5 meeting, at least to get a better 
understanding of what the data warehouse can do for us related to FERC, and 
maybe determine just how far along it currently is.  The original reason we 
were asked to meet on this issue is that it was thought that a lot of work 
had already been completed and it wouldn't take much to deliver an end 
product. The other attendees, as well as myself, need to understand what this 
can do for us as opposed to a potential solution in SAP.

Subject: Re: FERC Data Warehouse  

I am not sure the statement below from Ozlem is entirely accurate.  In 
addtion to Project Sunrise, I have asked Sheila Howard, who is the lead for 
the financial team in the ISC, to work with the Project Sunrise team to 
understand what your issues are and help determine a solution.  

Let me assure you that whether through the Project Sunrise or the ISC, we are 
working on your issue and it has NOT dropped off the radar screen.  As a 
matter of fact, Project Sunrise had a status meeting today, and this came up 
several times.  I think the only question is "what's the best approach for 
solving it"? 

I will leave it to Dave, as the ETS representative to Project Sunrise, along 
with Sheila, Mark, and the others listed below, to continue to work on a 
solution for the FERC problems.  Dave  - is there any reason NOT to proceed 
with the December 5 meeting under these assumptions?  I would just ask that 
Sheila be included.

Thanks!

If there is going to be no effort to fix my problem as a result  of the 
change in the effort, I am wondering why I should support the project at all?

Dear FERC-interested representatives,

Due to the current redirection of the data warehouse project (which is now 
part of Project Sunrise), it has been determined that it is best to postpone 
a FERC discussion/analysis until after the  collection of business 
requirements and final scoping of the project.    However, I will be 
recommending that a focus group be designated for FERC.  Thank you for your 
help and patience and I apologize for the upheaval and postponements.

Tzlem

The review by ETS of the FERC data warehouse information will be on Tuesday 
December 5th at 10:00am, location TBA. This initial review should last approx 
one hour and your input would be greatly appreciated. I will inform you of 
the location when this is established. Please feel free to contact me if you 
have any questions.

FYI
Attached is a a current worksheet of the ETS accounting organization. (Sorry, 
I haven't been able to prepare an org. chart yet). This still reflects Clean 
Fuels as dotted line; but we could easily "plug" Kerry and his organization 
into the structure in any one of a number of areas, but most likley would be 
with Jennifer Lev in consolidations. I would like to have nonregulated 
entities kept separate from interestate pipelines -as possible.

Gentlemen - below is a list of deals/issues the have come across my email 
that -I believe- need financial/acounting attention 
1. Accounting for FGT/FP&L $6.5mm "value"  account
2. Accounting for FGT/FP&L $1.5mm settlement
3. Citrus/ENA/Bridgeline gas sale/purchase
4. TW 2002 fuel sales
5. Bolivia investment
6. TW PCB remediation for PG&E
7. NNG(?) depreciation study
8. Machine shop accounting
9. Accounting for residual SAP costs
10. EOTT related reserve reversal
11. EOTT/Enron pipeline services operating agreement
12. Payroll distribution
13. NNG SLA accounting
14. FAS133/8; hedge effectiveness 
15.Trading authority
16. NNG Semco/Duluth transaction.
17, NBPL investment candidates

I thought I would attempt to get a list going to which we can add/delete 
deals/isuues.

Comments?

PLEASE KEEP CONFIDENTIAL

FYRvw - Based on my notes, attached is an initial recap of individuals to be 
included in "Accounting", and their current function. I have preliminarily 
left gas accounting in accounting, and as discussed, left Clean Fuels out -as 
a dotted line. 

Please edit/comment as necessary. 

I hope to work with Rod, Jerry and the Accounting Director team (Wiederholt, 
Chandler, and Cobb) to finalize the organization. 

Tracy and John K were going to work the Planning-side some more; and I will 
also discuss the other issues mentioned, with Rod at the Management 
conference.

Stay tuned...

Jim, gave an excellent start.

Commercial Support group:
Develop a format to best compare the volumes, margins and applicable expenses 
of 2001 Actual and Current Estimates/Forecasts to 2001 Plan to 2000 Actual 
for use by Danny McCarty as a Commercial GOAL.

Identify potential areas to monetize contracts or assets where feasible.

Improve Citrus/FGT Cash Flow forecasting by utilizing SAP as much as possible.

FYI:  I participated in Super Saturday (12/9/00; very interesting).

Subject: Proposal to Caithness Big Sandy

Attached for your review and comment is a broad outline of a rate proposal to 
Caithness for the construction and operation of the 40-mile lateral to the 
Big Sandy project.  This non-binding proposal was requested by Caithness' 
consultant, George Briden, as a starting point for modeling the economics of 
the project's gas supply and a basis for further discussions aimed at 
designing an appropriate deal structure.  For your information, James 
Centilli calculated the transport rate based on the (+/- 30%) $20.33MM cost 
estimate with a ten-year (contract) amortization.  

I plan to put this in the mail by the close of business tomorrow.  If you 
have any suggestions, please let me hear from you by mid-day.   Thanks.

Attached is list of the outstanding insurance claims provided to us by Risk 
Management.  As I indicated to Rod yesterday, I have been informed that the 
premiums that were paid this year were $15,000,000 and given the claims 
submitted at $43,000,000, Corp is looking for a way to mitigate anticipated 
rising premium costs.   They are looking very hard at Hawkin's Audit Program 
to help them out.  As this list indicates, International assets should bear 
the brunt of future costs.  The Transwestern train derailment will be about 
$700,000 ($200k for repair and $500k for buisness interruption), both of 
which will ulitmately be reimbursed by the railroad.

equity, for the years 2000 and 2001.
Rick Causey has asked me to present  this "Total Capital" broken down between 
the following categories:
  
  Strategic Pipelines 
  Strategic Power Plants
  Strategic Communications
  Strategic Other (Subdivide as you like) 
  Merchant
  
Not included in the attached numbers are off balance sheet items. Please give 
a summary of any off balance sheet
items.

The capital presented is estimated from the plans recently submitted. I am 
not looking for total precision, just good
estimates. I need this information early next week. It will be used in a 
board presentation.

Actually, I am not sure NPNG currently has a lot of expertise in this area.  
I have asked John to evaluate whether corporate should handle NBPL's 
insurance needs.  We have Jim Menning, spending about 75% of his time on 
insurance so I am hopeful that a move to corporate could reduce our costs - 
but obviously eliminating 0.75 FTEs is minor compared to the effect (plus or 
minus) of a change in direct insurance premiums or allocated insurance 
costs.  Do either of you have experience or information that would support 
either side, i.e. directly manage ETS insurance function or outsource it all 
to corporate?

Mark Russ will be representing Michael Ratner at the PRC on 12/12 and 12/13.  
I am looking into the pre-ranking meeting that is supposedly going on now.  
However, the Associate Analyst program indicated that this was a pre-ranking 
for Associates within EBS.  Please provide your feedback to Mark before the 
PRC on 12/12 and 12/13.

Rod,  

The PRC process closed last week.  You should have received information 
regarding representing your associates/analysts at a meeting to be held on 
the 28th of this month.  If not, you should check with the Associate/Analysts 
or HR for this information.

After the pre-ranking meeting, then you should submit the ranking and your 
evaluation to Mark for the final Corporate ranking.

Thanks.

For O&M fees at interconnects NBPL has been charging the customer an 
estimated incremental cost, which under the cost of service tariff was 
credited back to O&M (where the incremental costs were originally charged).  
We are definitely going to change this now.

In at least one situation in the past, NPNG had the contract for maintaining 
a short lateral for the Synfuels plant in ND (in fact Phil may have been 
involved with this when he was District Manager in Glasgow).  In that case, a 
small amount of O&M was left at NPNG and the revenue was booked at NPNG.  

In most cases the customer is negotiating the fees as a part of service on 
NBPL and I would suggest that unless these are significant contracts the 
amounts be left at NBPL.  The main reasons are accounting ease, avoidance of 
fiduciary issues, and customer relations.

In other similar situations where Operations has had an opportunity to 
provide a service for a fee, we have been looking to EAMR as the entity to do 
the work.  Does the NBPL sitiuation preclude EAMR from taking on this role?  
I would assume, unless there has been a change, that given the fact that NBPL 
does not have any employees it would be difficult for NBPL to provide the 
service.

Subject: O&M Fees at Interconnects

The issue of O&M fees at new interconnects has been raised by several 
customers.  A meeting to discuss this issue and how Operations will determine 
these fees, is scheduled for Monday, December 18, on your calendar.  Your 
input is very important at this meeting.

Several of NBPL's customers are currently waiting for answers on this issue 
and NBPL needs to respond very soon to these customers.  NBPL has been asked 
to renegotiate fees (PGL&C) as well as set fees for a period of longer than 1 
year (Harvest States).  NBPL has also been asked to operate a 1/2 mile of 
line from a meter station to a power plant (Lakefield Junction).  We need to 
agree on a decision from both a business and an operations perspective.  
Currently, we have estimated operating fees at interconnects where we charge 
a fee and charge a standard monthly fee of $2,000 per month with the 
exception of two interconnects.  With the tariff changes, operating fees will 
not automatically be recovered in the future.  How are these operating fees 
going to be tracked and charged?  Does NBPL charge all interconnect customers 
the same fee?  Should NBPL absorb some or all of the operating costs as a 
cost of doing business?  These questions need to be answered at the meeting.

Thanks!

Stan.  Per your request, here is the update for the first three Year 2000 
Goals and Objectives for ETS.

1.  We obtained our FERC certificate, completed construction on the Ft. Myers 
lateral, and made initial deliveries to FPL at their plant on October 1.  

2.  We have obtained a very favorable Preliminary Determination on our Phase 
V project, in spite of having significantly revised the filing on August 1 to 
include TECO in the Phase V project.  FERC staff is working on issuing our 
Environmental Impact Statement, which has been delayed due to the TECO 
filing.   We remain on target, however, for timely receipt of our certificate 
to allow construction by the second quarter of next year.

3.  Mr. Hayes and is team are continuing negotiations with prospective 
shippers for a Phase VI project.


If you have any questions, please call me.

Rock

Dear Rod:

You must be up to your ears in administrative paperwork.

I just wanted to touch base about our discussions.  You said that it would
be to your advantage to start some sort of analysis review this year
(budgets??), if this is still important we can still get started.  We can
start with one or more people with 48 hours notice.  We have a team on
stand by for you.  Let me know if I can do anything to help in this area.

Best regards,

J. Mark Kearns

Rod,
FYI - Here is Ted Robinson's (ENA) assessment of MTBE's situation for 2001.  
Sounds a lot like 2000.  Our 2001 Plan is based on an average margin of $0.23 
for MTBE.

Subject: 2001 MTBE

Per our discussion, I have talked with Adam on butanes for Q2/Q3 of 2001 and 
put a guess at next years MTBE.  Adam feels the strip for butane would run 
around 58 cpg or so.  Nat gas is on fire right now and looking at the screen 
is around 5.25 for that timeframe, which would put methanol around 60cpg.  
Elliott says that even with the run up on gas, methanol has yet to respond.  
Maybe it moves up if MTBE turns around and we see some demand come in, but 
for now it has stalled.

During Q2/Q3 2000, MTBE was extremely volatile, ranging from 8cpg  to 65cpg 
over merc gasoline ( with an average of 33cpg).  Several factors contributed 
to this swing, including strong demand in Europe and the US due to  tighter 
gasoline specs in both regions.  These specs remain and to that extend, many 
of the factors that contributed to last summer's run up will be in place in 
2001.   As we close in on 2003, US demand should decrease as refiners, 
especially on the West Coast, gear toward a phaseout of the product.  MTBE 
usage will remain in place in 2001 however as all contract users (refiners) 
are out for bids on product for the full year and Europe goes through a 
second round of tightening gasoline specifications. 

 Gasoline is currently around 77cpg for the Q2/Q3 strip.  I don't think that 
20-25 cpg as an average over gasoline is an unreasonable assumption on which 
to  base future Q2/Q3  economics.  With butane at 58cpg  and methanol at 
60cpg, this would yield an MTBE price of 97cpg and a margin over feed cost of 
19-24cpg.  Q1 and Q4 will more than likely be somewhat lower, but provide 
ample margins in Feb/Mar as well as Sep/Oct .

Hopefully this helps.  If you have any further questions, give me a call.

Ted

                      (Published November 18, 2000)

                      Gov. Tony Knowles said Friday that he backs
building a natural gas pipeline that runs to Fairbanks then down the
                      Alaska Highway to Canada and the Lower 48.

                      "My way is the highway," Knowles quipped during
the 7 a.m. speech before the Resource Development Council, a
                      nonprofit group that advocates developing Alaska's
resources. "An Alaska Highway pipeline will be the beginning of a
                      new economy for our state for the next 50 years."

                      Knowles' backing of the politically popular route
met an enthusiastic response among state officials and industry
                      executives. The construction would cost an
estimated $6 billion to $10 billion and could be finished by 2007. The
                      highway route would bring gas to Fairbanks, which
uses coal and fuel oil for electricity and heating, and hundreds of
                      permanent jobs in-state.

                      But proponents of a rival route along the Arctic
coast to Canada question if the highway route would be too
                      expensive to ever be built. They say their cheaper
project would give the state more money.

                      Driving this year's revival of gas pipeline
proposals, after more than decade of dormancy, are soaring natural gas
                      prices in the Lower 48.

                      With prices high, optimism bubbled high in the
hall at the Hotel Captain Cook, where Knowles spoke.

                      " 'My way is the highway' -- that's great," said
Mano Frey, local AFL-CIO head, as he shook Knowles' hand after the
                      speech. "If there is anything we can do to help,
just let us know."

                      Knowles' position on the pipe was hardly
unexpected as the governor and his staff have made broad hints that the
                      administration would back the highway route.
Knowles earlier said the project must hire Alaskans, provide revenue to
                      the state government and bring natural gas to the
state's residents, particularly those in Fairbanks.

                      All of Alaska's key political leaders now back the
highway route.

                      Knowles sped past other options for the North
Slope's gas reserves, including plans for converting the gas to liquid
                      form for the oil pipeline or shipping it to Valdez
or Kenai where it could be chilled, liquefied and shipped overseas as
                      liquefied natural gas, or LNG.

                      Communities along the oil pipeline route are
pushing an LNG project. North Slope Borough Mayor George Ahmaogak
                      said a pipeline to Fairbanks may help their plans.
Most agree there is enough gas on the Slope for multiple gas
                      projects. A spur line from Fairbanks to Anchorage
or Valdez could feed an LNG export project.

                      The most obvious losers with Friday's speech were
the Northwest Territories and Arctic Resources Co. from Houston,
                      Texas, a company hoping to build a Beaufort
pipeline, connecting the Slope with the Mackenzie River Delta.

                      Knowles' criticism of the Beaufort route focused
on environmental issues of putting a pipe in the Arctic seabed and
                      the time it would take to clear regulatory hurdles
with the project, suggesting such complications would erase any
                      cost advantage of the shorter route.

                      Forrest Hoglund, chief executive of Arctic
Resources, said Knowles' position "certainly makes our position more
                      difficult." But Hoglund said the cost advantages
of the Beaufort route remain. Gas prices will likely fall, and "the
                      markets will decide what this project looks like."

                      Pietro de Bastiani, assistant to Northwest
Territories minister Jim Antoine, said his government still supports the

                      Beaufort route. He said a pipeline tapping
Mackenzie gas would be economic without Alaska's reserves.

                      However, neighboring Yukon Territory supports the
Alaska Highway route. Much of the huge construction cost would
                      be spent there.

                      "We need this project," said Scott Kent, a member
of the Yukon Legislative Assembly.

                      What Exxon Mobil, Phillips and BP Amoco will do is
less certain. They are the three big owners of the North Slope's 35
                      trillion cubic feet of natural gas.

                      This week all three made optimistic but vague
comments about their plans for Alaska's gas. The companies hope to
                      jointly study a gas development project, said
Exxon spokesman Bob Davis.

                      Phillips and BP expect a decision on a preferred
project by the second half of 2001.

Since Elaine and I are planning to be at the AA Symposium tomorrow, we are 
providing you our laundry list of year end IBIT items for discussion at your 
meeting tomorrow.  

FYI, if we have more items than you need in total, the items I would prefer 
to pull back first would be the Mobil payment, the DOT safety user fees, and 
the capitalization of specialized overheads.








Please let us know how you wish to proceed.

I have attached the resume of a good friend of mine who is starting to look 
for a job.  For the last year or so he has been running his own company, but 
prior to that he has worked in the energy business, primarily in power.  He 
is trying to get a better sense of Enron, better than I could tell him, and I 
thought you would be a good person for him to speak with.  Please let me know 
if you would be willing to meet with him and I can make the arrangements.

Thanks,

Michael

Greetings!

Due to overwhelming demand, we've added new functionality to our "Improve
Your Boss" assessment results.  In addition to your original grades (by
category), you can now see how you did on a QUESTION-BY-QUESTION basis.

We are providing this enhanced reporting free of charge.  To see this new
information, just login at:
http://www.improvenow.com/assessments/IYBoss/BossResults/

Your login is: rhaysle@enron.com
Your password is: 84ot8g

We hope you find this more detailed information beneficial.  Please let us
know if you have other suggestions to make this tool more useful to you.

If you should care to repeat the assessment process, you should be aware
that we are now charging "top-down" users $9.95 for each employee you invite
to participate:
http://www.improvenow.com/assessments/iyboss/index.cfm?action=topdown

In keeping with our vision, however, new assessments initiated "bottom-up"
by individual employees are still free.

On a final note, we are also undertaking a limited number of custom
development projects.  If you're interested in a customized employee opinion
survey, retention survey, or 360-degree feedback tool, please visit our site
and complete this short online inquiry form:
http://www.improvenow.com/channels/hr/index.cfm?action=customform

Thank you.

Since ETS has third party debt on it's books, the debt and cost of carry will 
be excluded from the calculation so as not to double count.  

Rick wants it to actualy be booked.  I lean towards just calculating it and 
not actually make entries (I know that entries will cause all sorts of 
additional issues).   Nothing has been formalized yet.

What do we do with debt on the books of the entities?  Ignore it?   And my 
understanding is that this will not be used for actual booking of anything  
in the books,

Subject: Capital Charge and Calculating Return on Invested Capital

Over the last few months, we have been working on a new methodology to 
measure and report business unit's retrurns on invested capital.   Several 
different variations were considered, and I am glad to report that Skilling, 
Causey and Fastow have approved the process outlined here.

Simply stated (with an example shown below):  Return on equity will be 
calculated based on a pre-determined debt/equity structure.  Business unit 
capital will include both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet uses of 
capital and business unit's will be charged for the cost of their debt at 
Enron's cost of funds.  Business unit's should focus on improving their 
return on equity over time.

______________________________________________________________________________
______________________________________


______________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________


This metric will not replace other targets (i.e., IBIT and Funds Flow).  

We are currently working to overlay this approach to the submitted 2001 
Plans.  If you have questions, please contact myself or Mike Deville.

Rod,
Attached below is the draft Deal Approval Sheet for the Trailblazer 
construction project.  Jerry Martin mentioned that ETS might be interested in 
including an alternative in the bid response that offered a lease option on 
the deal.
Jerry has asked me to follow up with you on this possibility.  
What additional information would be helpful in considering the lease and 
what would be the next steps?

Arnold, 
Attached is the revised DASH for Trailblazer,  

In red on the first page the statement about the finance commitments needs to 
be changed, however, you should probably provide the verbage for that because 
you know what you want to say about the cancellation and cashflow curves. 

Also, some of the names for sign off like G. Matthews (spelling?) need to be 
verified and their project function should be verified also.

After you update the file, just e-mail the 2nd revision back to me.  

We should probably consider setting up a directory on the OTS server as we go 
forward to make the sharing of files easier.

Rod,

The ETS Operations Administration and P&SM organization will support all of 
the objectives listed below in whatever manner we can. but I feel that we can 
be most directly involved with the last one:

9).  E-Commerce Strategy

 We can work with the GSS organization to develop an E-Commerce Strategy and 
proceed with implementation.   Some specific areas that we need more 
development and implmentation of is the use of :

 "Payment on Receipts"  this eliminates the further processing of vendor 
invoices related to approved purchase orders.

 SAP Auto generated Purchase Orders.  - When we have designated NPA 
agreements in place for specific commodities, let the system convert the 
requisition to a purchase order and route to our preferred Supplier.

 Use of reverse EDI - allows vendors to input verbal orders to them into 
their Purchasing System and reverse create a "Purchase Order" into our SAP 
System.

 An E-Commerce system that can be implemented  anywhere within the Enron 
world that provides for a quick seamless transaction from "Cradle to Grave" - 
Requisition to Payment".

 Our implementation of an "Integrated Supplier" is allowing us test ground 
for many of these applications with an outside Supplier partner.

Morris

I would like to see a first draft of the 2001 goals & objectives by December 
11, 2000.

I specifically would like to see goals dealing with the following:

1.) Resolution of the Navajo Right -of- way issue;
2.) Development of a specific business plan for NNG's South End;
3.) Timetable for TW's new expansion;
4.) Timetable for the completion of FGT's Phase IV, Phase V, and PhaseVI;
5.) Pipeline safety legislation;
6.) Divesting of Enron's clean fuels business;
7.) Business developments efforts;
8.) NNG's Equivalent Unit Risk account  (how do we get our money back now !); 
and,
9.) E-Commerce Strategy.


We will discuss further at up-coming staff meetings.

Before I answer this email, thought I would confirm with you how we intend 
collecting and distributing the $180K  rebate for the pre-buy program.  The 
methanol plant contributed $300K toward the $1.500K goal.

Subject: Re: Cooper Alliance Pre-buy program  

Shirley,

Now that we have discussed it, I understand sufficiently to be confident that 
it's good all around for us to participate.  It will alter our procurement 
timing a little if we do delay our overhauls to next year (we would be buying 
the long lead, high dollar stuff this quarter even if we do delay), but it 
seems clear that it is in Enron's best interest to make those slight changes. 

I will let our controller and Finance Manager know what's up just to keep 
them informed.  They may be helpful to us in figuring out how to get the 
rebate to come into GPG through Enron Methanol Company or Enron Clean Fuels.  
I will admit to very limited knowlege of how those transactions take place.

I will also let Debbie Hinkle (our buyer, 281/882-4232) know to expect your 
call about prices we have been receiving from Cooper.

Thanks again, 

Steve

Steve,

Per my voice mail today.

We would like to offer your operation the opportunity to receive 12% rebate 
on parts purchased from Cooper.  We have prepaid $1.5MM for parts and will 
receive a 12% rebate.

Other parts of GPG have used about $600K of the pre-buy and we would like to 
role your shutdown requirements into the program.

Please call me as soon as possible and I will answer any questions you have.

Look forward to talking to you. 
Regards,
Shirley Jo Dickens-Wilson

Rod,
Caroline forwarded me your questions regarding the Risk System so I wanted to 
go ahead and respond since Steve is out this week.

I don't think Philippe requires the level of due diligence that we performed, 
but we were getting questioned on buying a 3rd party product vs. using an 
Enron Risk System.  We did more research and got the other groups involved so 
that they would understand our decision.  I believe everyone is now 
comfortable with our purchase decision.

In our analysis of systems, we selected the Caminus product in part because 
we had several individual references from Arthur Andersen, Deliotte &Touche 
and Ernst & Young.  These organizations, especially Arthur Andersen, have 
audited this application and have actually participated in numerous 
implementations.  Ernst & Young recently selected Caminus for Equitable 
Resources.   Arthur Anderson implemented the application for Conoco and 5 or 
6 other companies, and Deloitte Touche recently selected the product for 
Tractabel.  After talking with individuals from these accounting firms, we 
felt very confident that the product was sound, and we should not have audit 
concerns.  Obviously, we have a lot of business procedures that have to be 
established, and there is time in the work plan to do that work, but a lot of 
those decisions drive how the application is configured so we need to get the 
product purchased work through the details of how we implement the new 
business procedures since the system does drive a lot of processes. 

Regarding costs, we have an approved work order for $650,000 which covers all 
the initial hardware, software, implementation costs and first year 
maintenance.  This cost does represent a very limited implementation with 
only 10 concurrent users, no customization except a few reports, and no 
electronic interfaces or data conversion.  The assumption is that initially 
the volume would be so low that an automated interface may not be cost 
justified, and the data would manually be loaded since it was low volume as 
well.  The on-going costs are estimated at approximately $100,000/year.  We 
did not perform a separate cost/benefit analysis as this was in the original 
cost of the Revenue Management RAROC.  Let me know if you have any other 
questions or there are open issues that we need to address prior to 
completing the contract.  We are hoping to get this signed and the project 
underway next week.  Thanks.

Phil, Rod & Mike -- please find attached a set of slides which will look very 
familiar to you.  They are the same format as the GTB slides we recently 
discussed, but are for the Trailblazer bid.  I would like to talk to Stan 
about this next Monday when we meet to brief him on GTB.  But, since I am out 
of the office until Friday (2 PRCs and Omaha trip), time is tight.

Do you want to review them Friday in person, before Friday on the phone, put 
off discussing with Stan, or discuss with Stan without us meeting?  I'm very 
comfortable with this one, and would like to go ahead and put it on Stan's 
table.

Mike - by the way, I meant to ask you at staff this morning -- can you 
clarify the memo you and Colleen issued regarding the role of EAMR as only a 
consultant?  I thought we discussed using EAMR as the contracting entity in 
projects such as these.  In that case, EAMR would take more than consulting 
risks.

Thanks,
Jerry

I don't think we can wait. We need FERC solutions in SAP (and perhaps the 
data warehouse) relatively quickly. 
We have an "enterprise" issue localized in ETS -if that helps getting any 
action.

Fundamentally, through my recent "investigation" I have become acquainted 
with numerous significant FERC module and FERC related issues -with little 
apparent solution to date. The items are being worked...

Composite depreciation is not correct  -millions of $
SAP natural accounts do not reconcile to the FERC module -the FERC trial 
balance does NOT balance
Labor distribution true-ups are not correct for FERC purposes -costs are 
being misallocated  (this was originally deemed a show stopper)
AFUDC is not calculating consistently with pre SAP methodologies
FERC ledgers are not available
FERC "Users" were ready to test out the FERC data warehouse but that 
opportunity was nixed by the decisions below
We are unable to obtain detailed benefit information for rate purposes
Benefits have been charged out incorrectly (nearly resolved)
Anxiety issue >We have little confidence we'll be able to efficiently prepare 
timely year end FERC Form2 reports* for Enron pipelines (submission deadlines

Do you think it better that I wait and see what comes of this, or because I 
have a singular need that I cause a small group to come togehter and focus on 
this?     The fact that there is no solution is the issue and no solution 
merely means I have to find one, since I don't have the option of saying it's 
too hard or the system can't do it.    On the other hand I'm sure I don't 
know all the answers so I'm not sure of what the right process even is.

Subject: Re: FERC Data Warehouse

To all:

Hope this clarifies--

We are currently collating needs data from our interview cycle.
Preliminarily, the interviews confirm our suspicions:
 1. Cost & P/L reporting is the most widely held concern.
 2. Cash flow reporting (treasury, direct & indirect) follows closely.
 3.  There is no easy, readily available solution to FERC reporting.
 4. People have lost ad hoc query functionality with the implementation of 
SAP.

Project Sunrise's reporting charter will be to address these needs in the 
most efficient, cost effective way possible.
That could be through a data warehouse, could be through the FERC SAP module, 
could be through another avenue.
None of us has the answer to the methodology question yet (although we all 
have ideas).

I would prefer to keep the Project Sunrise team focused on the task at hand 
-- sifting through the interview information and developing a work plan.
We have followup interviews to schedule & complete, a data model to build, 
etc. Basically a lot of work on our plates.

However, FERC reporting is clearly a significant need that will be at the 
forefront of any reporting solution.
If our goal is to discuss this need in detail tomorrow, I'm all for it! I 
need the education.
If our goal is to look at progress towards a solution, we should look to 
postpone.
I take responsibility for distracting efforts in progress, but believe the 
delay worthwhile.

One final issue: Sean, the Sensecorp consultant who has been working on the 
project, is in California.
We may want to wait on his participation.

I believe we are all on the same page.

Why wouldn't we?  ETS has a specific gap that needs to be addressed, and we 
need to find the best way to fix it.  I would just be sure not to jump to the 
DW as the solution, unless the ISC has been given ample opportunity to 
propose a solution.  Be sure to go that route, too!

I feel we should proceed with the Dec 5 meeting, at least to get a better 
understanding of what the data warehouse can do for us related to FERC, and 
maybe determine just how far along it currently is.  The original reason we 
were asked to meet on this issue is that it was thought that a lot of work 
had already been completed and it wouldn't take much to deliver an end 
product. The other attendees, as well as myself, need to understand what this 
can do for us as opposed to a potential solution in SAP.

I am not sure the statement below from Ozlem is entirely accurate.  In 
addtion to Project Sunrise, I have asked Sheila Howard, who is the lead for 
the financial team in the ISC, to work with the Project Sunrise team to 
understand what your issues are and help determine a solution.  

Let me assure you that whether through the Project Sunrise or the ISC, we are 
working on your issue and it has NOT dropped off the radar screen.  As a 
matter of fact, Project Sunrise had a status meeting today, and this came up 
several times.  I think the only question is "what's the best approach for 
solving it"? 

I will leave it to Dave, as the ETS representative to Project Sunrise, along 
with Sheila, Mark, and the others listed below, to continue to work on a 
solution for the FERC problems.  Dave  - is there any reason NOT to proceed 
with the December 5 meeting under these assumptions?  I would just ask that 
Sheila be included.

Thanks!

Dear FERC-interested representatives,

Due to the current redirection of the data warehouse project (which is now 
part of Project Sunrise), it has been determined that it is best to postpone 
a FERC discussion/analysis until after the  collection of business 
requirements and final scoping of the project.    However, I will be 
recommending that a focus group be designated for FERC.  Thank you for your 
help and patience and I apologize for the upheaval and postponements.

I was just kidding.  The EOTT template looked familiar to me.

As Caroline pointed out,  they used the ETS IT template and made a few name

What do you think about using something like this proposal for most of our

by Morris specifically for EOTT projects, but there is no reason to exclude 
others.

I'm unclear as to the appropriate accounting period; but -to me- the deal 
should revolve around the economics, and -as previously mentioned- if Kent 
and management believe prices are going to decline then a forward sale makes 
sense.

(But note that prices have continued to escalate sinse this deal was 
originally proposed)

Subject: Re: Insurance Claims

Actually, I am not sure NPNG currently has a lot of expertise in this area.  
I have asked John to evaluate whether corporate should handle NBPL's 
insurance needs.  We have Jim Menning, spending about 75% of his time on 
insurance so I am hopeful that a move to corporate could reduce our costs - 
but obviously eliminating 0.75 FTEs is minor compared to the effect (plus or 
minus) of a change in direct insurance premiums or allocated insurance 
costs.  Do either of you have experience or information that would support 
either side, i.e. directly manage ETS insurance function or outsource it all 
to corporate?

Simply stated (with an example shown below):  Return on equity will be 
calculated based on a pre-determined debt/equity structure.  Business unit 
capital will include both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet uses of 
capital and business unit's will be charged for the cost of their debt at 
Enron's cost of funds.  Business unit's should focus on improving their 
return on equity over time.

This metric will not replace other targets (i.e., IBIT and Funds Flow).  

We are currently working to overlay this approach to the submitted 2001 
Plans.  If you have questions, please contact myself or Mike Deville.

Rod - we have discussed the accounting for plane uasage on year 2001 and have 
determined that  the actual trip costs will be billed direct to the user's 
RC.  However,  the 2001 budget costs for the plane have been included in Dan 
McCarty's executive RC budget.  Thus, we will have to develop a procedure to 
charge the RC for atctual costs, but credit the plane budget and maintain 
some control as to the overall status of the budget.

Who would you like me to work with to develop/coordinate these procedures?

Thanks!

Here is a list of publications that we may want to get articles in when the 
time is right.  Both Mary and Greg can help in our efforts.

NALD, American Indian Report, Indian Country Today.


Okay, Michael, let me translate. 

 ??????NALD is the Native American Law Digest. ?It is published monthly, and 
Greg has been the editor-in-chief for the last 10 years. ?It provides a ?
synopsis of the most recent legal cases of interest to Native Americans ?
(both in tribal and non-tribal courts) and also runs articles. ?Articels do 
not necessarily have to be on strictly legal topics. 

??????The American Indian Report is also a monthly and also published by 
Falmouth. ?It covers much broader issues of interest to Indian tribes ??as
compared to the NALD.

 ??????Greg has a great relationship with Falmouth. ?I also know someone over 
there who owes me a big favor. ?Plus they are looking for Indian stories--and 
upbeat stories since many of the stories from Indian Country are downers. 

 ??????Indian Country Today is a newspaper and I believe that it is published 
weekly. ?Greg has good contacts, and the writers are ALWAYS looking for 
interesting stories. 

??????Also, I know a freelancer for the Gallup, NM daily paper. ?Some 
consider Gallup tp be the heart of Indian Country--and five or six tribes, 
including the Navajo are covered by the paper and read it as well. 

??????I, of course, would put the New York Times on the list. ?As I said, I 
think they have two reporters trolling Indian Country (particularly in the 
SW) looking for stories of ?interest. ?Although not widely read by Native 
Americans, it is read by educated Native Americans who are involved in state 
and national politics as well as by Native American attorneys and other 
professionals. Also, 30,000 to 40,000 Native Americans live in the New York 
metropolitan area. 

Also, major cities with significant Native American populations which have 
daily newspapers: 

Phoenix 

Albuquerque 

Denver 

Seattle 

Washington, DC ? 

??????Also, there is another magazine (bimonthly): Native Peoples: Arts and 
Lifeways. ?It casts a wide net and has included info on art, food, politics, 
grants tribes have received, etc. ?This magazine is read both by Indian 
wannabes and Indians. ?I also think it is read by Indians in the 
diaspora--that is Indians far away from their tribes or from Indian culture 
in general. 

??????Also, I believe that the new Native American museum scheduled sometime 
in the next decade (?) will have its own publication and will probably cast a 
wide net as do Native Peoples and Indian Report. ?(the museum I think was 
supoosed to open in 2000 and then 2001 and so I have no idea......) 

??????I have also just sent an email to a friend of mine who is the director 
of the Tribal Libraries Program at the New Mexico State Library to see if I 
have missed any publications of significance. ?The State Library has a 
newsletter which goes out to all the ?tribal libraries in New Mexico, and 
that number is 21. ?I think the newsletter is published every 2 weeks, and I 
am sure we could have this project covered in it. 

??????Also, the following paragraph is an email I sent to Greg Smith this 
evening. 

??????Is there any centralized way to find out about tribal papers? (I am 
laughing even ?as I write this....) For example, I know Navajo, Laguna, and 
Hopi have ?newspapers. ?Do we know of others? ?Also, do you know the name of 
the journal published at Cornell? Isn't that about Indian education? 

Regards--- 

Mary

Subject: Asset Divestiture Approval

Attached is a  "Asset Divestiture Approval Form" for the sale of the 
Faribault Minnesota branchline location # 83801 consisting of 1.091 miles of 
6" pipe and the Faribault TBS#1 and the Northfield branchlines location No.'s 
85001 and 85002 consisting of approximately 4.9 miles of 4" pipe, and the 
Northfield TBS#1.  



Please indicate your approval or rejection of this proposal on the approval 
form and return to either James Centilli (EB4250) or David Waymire (OMA0755) 
by 5PM Monday, November 27th.  If you have questions or concerns, please 
contact James Centilli (853-5028) or myself (398-7062).

These branchlines are experiencing heavy encroachment.  The Faribault 
branchline is currently being odorized by NSP per a previous arrangement in 
order to comply with a commitment NNG made to the DOT to transport odorized 
gas because of the population density along the pipeline.  

There is no threat of a by pass by selling these branchlines.  There is an 
estimated annual O&M savings of $10k to $20k plus the avoided expense, 
exposure and operational headaches of not having to monitor high pressure 
branchline odorization.

The net book value of these facilities is $57,712.  The facilities will be 
sold for $1.  In addition, NSP has agreed to enter into a 1 year 
transportation agreement guaranteeing incremental revenues of $350,000.  

The net book value of the facilities, is assumed to be of such small value as 
to be de minimus as allowed by previous rulings of the Commission and  will 
be treated as a non-operating unit.  This will allow the undepreciated 
balance to be cleared to depreciation reserves.

The sale will require that the Northfield TBS be relocated upstream of the 
main line take off at an estimated cost of $225,000.  

David

Lisa,

I decide to jot down some of my ideas for our eCommerce strategy.  For the 
most part, these are "brainstorming fodder".  Here goes:

Mindset:  If it can be sold, it can done via the Internet.
Mindset:  If it is currently done on a form, a forms-based electronic version 
should be created.
Provide our customers, operators with transaction preparation software which 
can be run on a desktop or notebook computer and a PDA.  Ensure that a 
synching mechanism allows for movement of the transaction to and from the 
PDA.  Use models such as MS Money for the PocketPC.  Give away this software 
and the pre-programmed PDA.
Allow feeding of the above transactions into an asynchronous process on our 
side.  This will help deal with unreliable connectivity.  Customers should be 
able to inspect the progress what is in our system.
Provide "wireless snippets" of our current applications.  This means 
extracting key decision points so that internal people or our customer can 
make them from anywhere.  For example, the customer would be able to confirm 
a pre-arranged capacity release deal.  Another example: contract request 
approvals could be moved to cell phones or PDAs.  This would speed our 
business processes.
Provide "respondable" notifications.  Internal people or our customer would 
subscribe to the types they wish to receive.  For example, a customer could 
be notified of a higher bid on a biddable capacity release offer and have the 
opportunity to bid higher via her cell phone or PDA.  Another example:  
support personnel could be notified of an unresponsive server and have the 
ability to initiate a reboot from her cell phone or PDA.
Base most or all of our Web pages on XML or provide an XML download (in 
addition to the current comma-delimited choice).  We should lead the way in 
identifying the necessary "vocabularies" for GISB data sets and data not 
currently defined by GISB.  This would permit the customer to move the data 
into any of several XML-capable tools such as spreadsheets, word processors 
and so on.  The more sophisticated customer may use the Web page address to 
extract data into their own custom apps.
Implement the supernom across ETS pipelines.
Is there an opportunity for us to overbook as do the airlines?
Expose some of our systems functionality via remote method calls using Simple 
Object Access Protocol (SOAP).  SOAP is based on the Internet standards of 
HTTP and XML and is, therefore, platform/ technology agnostic.  For example, 
we may allow the customer to obtain certain non-proprietary data base 
information such as name and legal descriptions of point locations, legal 
entity names, tax authorities, lat/long and so on.  We could get more 
adventurous by exposing such things as capacity currently not nominated ahead 
of the nom deadline.
Provide the customer the ability to assemble a contract electronically with 
pre-approved terms and conditions, locations and alternate locations, etc.
Provide annual usage statements to assist the customer with their planning.
Provide graphical displays of certain tabular data.  For example, we might 
show the customer actual versus nominated, nominated vs. MDQ, monthly usage 
charts, etc.
Consider where we could or should apply fees to some of the above services.

I believe I have a few more of these that I haven't yet extracted.  I hope 
these can be useful in today's session.

Terry

Attached is a draft of  2001 Objectives.  I have not yet had the opportunity 
to sit down with Dave Neubauer and his direct reports and probably won't 
until after the holidays.  I will update the objectives at that time.

 I have not included some of the standard objectives (e.g. "prepare current 
estimate") but have tried to keep the statements  at a higher level.

Let me know if you have any questions or wish to discuss.

Rod,  to my knowledge the Commission has not specifically defined what is de 
minimus.   The working definition of an Operating Unit or System is taken 
from an Office of the Chief Accountant Interpretative Letter issued  May 26, 
1961.  "The principal tests are amount of investment, character of the 
property acquired, and continuity of operation.  The following have been 
deemed to be operating units or systems: a large compressor station, a 
processing plant, an important measuring station, a gathering system or 
important segment thereof,  a transmission line or important segment.  If the 
transaction involves such a small amount of property as to be de minimus, it 
need not be considered as an operating unit."  If a customer is attached to 
the facilities to be sold it is considered prima facie evidence that the 
property is an operating unit or system.

In a July 8, 1992, the NNG Rate department in an interoffice memorandum 
regarding the Definition of an Operating Units or System noted "The 
Commission has not specifically defined de minimus, however, based on past 
rulings we can assume that the investment must be something less than $9 
million, or a pipeline less than 7.586 miles."

The 1.091 miles of 6" pipe and Faribault TBS #1 and the Northfield 4" 
branchlines of 4.9 miles and TBS have a net book value of $57,712. 

My main concern, if we use the de minimus rationale, are we not setting a 
precedent in which future sales or acquisitions will have to be viewed?  Some 
of those future de minimus sales could involve gains! 

Again, it is not clear how the Commission will make its determination.  The 
downside, if the Commission rejects our argument, NNG will have a $ 58K loss 
on the sale of these assets.

I think an argument can be made that the amount is de minimus which leads to 
a non-operating unit designation.

Gary:  Are you OK with the non-operating unit assumption based on deminimus 
NBV?
If you're OK with it and the lawyers are OK, then it must be OK for me.

Can anyone think of a reason why this should not be done or why the 
assumptions made here are not all 100% correct?   Is there any risk on the 
accounting?   Where is the contract for sale?

Subject: Asset Divestiture Approval

Attached is a  "Asset Divestiture Approval Form" for the sale of the 
Faribault Minnesota branchline location # 83801 consisting of 1.091 miles of 
6" pipe and the Faribault TBS#1 and the Northfield branchlines location No.'s 
85001 and 85002 consisting of approximately 4.9 miles of 4" pipe, and the 
Northfield TBS#1.  



Please indicate your approval or rejection of this proposal on the approval 
form and return to either James Centilli (EB4250) or David Waymire (OMA0755) 
by 5PM Monday, November 27th.  If you have questions or concerns, please 
contact James Centilli (853-5028) or myself (398-7062).

These branchlines are experiencing heavy encroachment.  The Faribault 
branchline is currently being odorized by NSP per a previous arrangement in 
order to comply with a commitment NNG made to the DOT to transport odorized 
gas because of the population density along the pipeline.  

There is no threat of a by pass by selling these branchlines.  There is an 
estimated annual O&M savings of $10k to $20k plus the avoided expense, 
exposure and operational headaches of not having to monitor high pressure 
branchline odorization.

The net book value of these facilities is $57,712.  The facilities will be 
sold for $1.  In addition, NSP has agreed to enter into a 1 year 
transportation agreement guaranteeing incremental revenues of $350,000.  

The net book value of the facilities, is assumed to be of such small value as 
to be de minimus as allowed by previous rulings of the Commission and  will 
be treated as a non-operating unit.  This will allow the undepreciated 
balance to be cleared to depreciation reserves.

The sale will require that the Northfield TBS be relocated upstream of the 
main line take off at an estimated cost of $225,000.

Kilmer stopped in to discuss where we are on the by Land portion of the 
phases VI thru whatever study.  Crux of our discussion is that we need a 
sit-down with you because our minds have blanked as to what Stan specifically 
wanted. 


I have run the numbers and I think I now have the cases on an apples and 
apples basis.  To do this I had to actually go out thru Phase X, 
extrapolating with Tom P's assistance.  I  thought I would have a little 
writeup by this PM, but I am not going to make it. I did want to get this 
note out so that we could get on your calendar.  In a nutshell, the levelized 
rate for land ends up being about 10% or so higher than that for sea based on 
our beliefs about the future market.  Build up faster and sea becomes more 
favorable while land is unchanged.   At any rate, I'll try to get something 
together in the AM, at least the graphs which I already have. (Tho I'm not 
sure I can explain it on paper.)

The attachment overviews an agreement for ETS to provide Desktop Services, 
Application/Database monitoring, and Windows 2000 conversion for  The New 
Power Company.  If approved by The New Power Company, this agreement will 
generate approximately $300,000 in revenue with a 35% profit margin for ETS.  
This will also open the door for a number of higher dollar service offerings 
including Optical Imaging and Disaster Recovery.

Bob Martinez and Kelly Strader are our IT point people for this transaction.  
We should know by year end if our proposal is accepted.

They will be doing a lot of  maintenance activity at the plant this month.  
Unfortunately, much of the key material needed to do the full turnaround 
needs several months lead time.  For example, we have already ordered the 
catalyst for the turnaround scheduled in March.  We discussed this yesterday 
with David Bush, the plant manager, and he said they would do what they could 
in December, but the critical path items would not be available until closer 
to March.  

The MTBE plant will be going down December 15th and the maintenance (spooge 
clean up) has been accelerated so we can come back up in Mid January to take 
advantage of an expected increase in MTBE margins.

As far as longer term shut down considerations go, no one seems to have a 
good grasp on what the methanol market will do.  Obviously, domestic 
production will be curtailed which should lift prices.  If prices rise and 
January gas prices fall back below $6.00, then we would probably come back up 
in January.  Regarding staffing effort, particularly in my group, the 
shutdown does not significantly impact the accountants and with a high 
vacation time and year-end coming up, their plates are pretty full.  At the 
plant, the purchasers, contract administrator and A/P folks will actually be 
busier trying to get materials  and contracts for both outages settled, 
especially with the timing change for the MTBE outage.

Let me know if you want to discuss this further.

Subject: Re: Methanol Plant Shut Down  

Thanks.     I think we need to be looking at the "accelerating of the 
maintenance" question as well.   If there is a possibility that the economic 
world has changed and there will be a longer shut down of the facilities, 
does it make sense to do that work now?      What are the decision points 
that we need to have information on in order to make that determination?     
Should we set up a small group to come up with an answer to this 
question?      Should we also be looking at what we could do to reduce the 
staffing by reassigning some of the people to other things and minimizing the 
effort expended against Clean Fuels, particularly in your group?

FYI only - We are shutting the methanol plant down for the month and are 
selling the natural gas back for $7.73.

Following my voice-mail to you, here is an e-mail from Dan Stockrahm of ANR 
(its got his e-mail address) advising his outside counsel, Rhonda Chandler, 
that he thinks any intervention by us would be counter-productive.  I'm sorry

The PRC process closed last week.  You should have received information 
regarding representing your associates/analysts at a meeting to be held on 
the 28th of this month.  If not, you should check with the Associate/Analysts 
or HR for this information.

After the pre-ranking meeting, then you should submit the ranking and your

Rod,

Legal is reviewing the contract at this time and hopes to finish next week.  
Yesterday I was notified that the guaranteed revenues from the transportation 
agreement may be raised by $5,000 to $10,000 due to revised sizing 
requirements of  the TBS as requested by NSP.  

We have had several meetings with operations to ensure that the facilities 
that are included in the sale are correct.  Also, the O&M savings are the 
estimates given by the field.  Based on average costs for similar facilities 
the expected O&M savings would be between $6K and $8k. The field has 
indicated however because of the encroachment that they receive a large 
number of line locate requests each year for these branchlines which drives 
up the O&M costs.  My expectations are that we would save closer to $10k in 
O&M costs rather than the $20k.

In addition, regulatory reminded me today that there is still a farm tap 
issue that has to be cleared up before the sale.  All farm taps receiving 
service from these branchlines must be disconnected and service provided by 
another utility prior to the sale.  The latest estimate that I received was 
that this would be completed by the end of the year.

Rod:

Certainly some of the goals and objectives from me and my group will be:

1.     Support and participation in meeting or exceeding operating company 
goals for UAF figures.  (note these have not been finalized yet so no numbers 
are in place)

2.     Support of project work and successful implementation of the new 
measurement system (PGAS)

3.     Continued support in the finalization or any ongoing projects involved 
with Gas Measurement Continuous Improvement

4.     Maintain or improve accuracy rates for GMS data to the Operating 
Companies from the current levels of 99% on station accuracy and 98% on total 
gross MMBtu processed.

I say keep pushing for an answer.  It will come when it comes, but, in my 
opinion, he who pushes his issues the best tends to get closer to what he 
wants.  

I am hoping we can both do better in both the short term with the tools we 
have (working through Sheila Howard/ISC) AND come up with something even 
better in the longer run (Project Sunrise).  I would push Sheila, the ISC 
will do what it can to the best of our ability (and I am hopeful there are 
still some things we can do without the DW to get you closer), and she and I 
can push Mark to the extent the ISC can't solve it completely.

Do you think it better that I wait and see what comes of this, or because I 
have a singular need that I cause a small group to come togehter and focus on 
this?     The fact that there is no solution is the issue and no solution 
merely means I have to find one, since I don't have the option of saying it's 
too hard or the system can't do it.    On the other hand I'm sure I don't 
know all the answers so I'm not sure of what the right process even is.

Subject: Re: FERC Data Warehouse

To all:

Hope this clarifies--

We are currently collating needs data from our interview cycle.
Preliminarily, the interviews confirm our suspicions:
 1. Cost & P/L reporting is the most widely held concern.
 2. Cash flow reporting (treasury, direct & indirect) follows closely.
 3.  There is no easy, readily available solution to FERC reporting.
 4. People have lost ad hoc query functionality with the implementation of 
SAP.

Project Sunrise's reporting charter will be to address these needs in the 
most efficient, cost effective way possible.
That could be through a data warehouse, could be through the FERC SAP module, 
could be through another avenue.
None of us has the answer to the methodology question yet (although we all 
have ideas).

I would prefer to keep the Project Sunrise team focused on the task at hand 
-- sifting through the interview information and developing a work plan.
We have followup interviews to schedule & complete, a data model to build, 
etc. Basically a lot of work on our plates.

However, FERC reporting is clearly a significant need that will be at the 
forefront of any reporting solution.
If our goal is to discuss this need in detail tomorrow, I'm all for it! I 
need the education.
If our goal is to look at progress towards a solution, we should look to 
postpone.
I take responsibility for distracting efforts in progress, but believe the 
delay worthwhile.

One final issue: Sean, the Sensecorp consultant who has been working on the 
project, is in California.
We may want to wait on his participation.

I believe we are all on the same page.

Why wouldn't we?  ETS has a specific gap that needs to be addressed, and we 
need to find the best way to fix it.  I would just be sure not to jump to the 
DW as the solution, unless the ISC has been given ample opportunity to 
propose a solution.  Be sure to go that route, too!

Subject: Re: FERC Data Warehouse  

I feel we should proceed with the Dec 5 meeting, at least to get a better 
understanding of what the data warehouse can do for us related to FERC, and 
maybe determine just how far along it currently is.  The original reason we 
were asked to meet on this issue is that it was thought that a lot of work 
had already been completed and it wouldn't take much to deliver an end 
product. The other attendees, as well as myself, need to understand what this 
can do for us as opposed to a potential solution in SAP.

I am not sure the statement below from Ozlem is entirely accurate.  In 
addtion to Project Sunrise, I have asked Sheila Howard, who is the lead for 
the financial team in the ISC, to work with the Project Sunrise team to 
understand what your issues are and help determine a solution.  

Let me assure you that whether through the Project Sunrise or the ISC, we are 
working on your issue and it has NOT dropped off the radar screen.  As a 
matter of fact, Project Sunrise had a status meeting today, and this came up 
several times.  I think the only question is "what's the best approach for 
solving it"? 

I will leave it to Dave, as the ETS representative to Project Sunrise, along 
with Sheila, Mark, and the others listed below, to continue to work on a 
solution for the FERC problems.  Dave  - is there any reason NOT to proceed 
with the December 5 meeting under these assumptions?  I would just ask that 
Sheila be included.

Thanks!

Dear FERC-interested representatives,

Due to the current redirection of the data warehouse project (which is now 
part of Project Sunrise), it has been determined that it is best to postpone 
a FERC discussion/analysis until after the  collection of business 
requirements and final scoping of the project.    However, I will be 
recommending that a focus group be designated for FERC.  Thank you for your 
help and patience and I apologize for the upheaval and postponements.

Attached is a draft of the Corporate Services Agreement to cover the property 
tax function EOTT is moving to Enron.  Could you please forward this to the 
appropriate Human Resources and Legal people?  I am not sure who would handle 
this.  Also, if Rodney Meek's start date is something other than December 1, 
the Exhibit B-1 will need to be redone.  Thanks.  Please call if you have 
questions.  Mary Ellen Coombe is out this week, but I can contact her if 
there are questions on the HR side.

As we are closing in on my arbitrary deadline, attached is the latest draft.  
It is relatively clean as Cooper has accepted most of our suggestions.  
Please note that Section 15D still needs to be re-worded as it references 
Exhibit H, which no longer exists.  Although most of you have not seen this 
document as a whole in a while, your input to various sections has been very 
helpful and I appreciate it.  As time is of the essence, I would be grateful 
for fresh eyes and perspective in what I hope will be a final read.  I hope 
to get this draft to Cooper by tomorrow morning.  For those prone to detail, 
the section numbers have been changed and therefore please pay attention to 
references to the numbers of other sections.  I would not want to reference 
the Force Majeure section when I meant to reference the Delivery section.

Cheers,

Michael

other areas are still being discussed.   This is the title I copied down when 
you first announced it in your staff meeting - I hope I got it correct.   cvb

Rod,

The asset divestiture procedure requires approval from all officers before 
marketing/field services begin negotiations with potential buyers.  Danny 
McCarty has sent me an e-mail indicating his approval.

I would like to see a first draft of the 2001 goals & objectives by December 
11, 2000.

I specifically would like to see goals dealing with the following:

1.) Resolution of the Navajo Right -of- way issue;
2.) Development of a specific business plan for NNG's South End;
3.) Timetable for TW's new expansion;
4.) Timetable for the completion of FGT's Phase IV, Phase V, and PhaseVI;
5.) Pipeline safety legislation;
6.) Divesting of Enron's clean fuels business;
7.) Business developments efforts;
8.) NNG's Equivalent Unit Risk account  (how do we get our money back now !); 
and,
9.) E-Commerce Strategy.


We will discuss further at up-coming staff meetings.

Rod - see me comment directly to Dan below.
FYI - We will probably book the income in December since the transaction was 
consummated in a 24hour period in December.  (I may need to bring a more 
reality/pragmatic focus into our accounting theory personnel).
OK?

If the deal was closed out -which it was; I would think the accounting would 
follow.

TW purchased a swap, exchanged a floating 2002 position for a fixed price.  
It was purchased at current market so there is no profit until the 2002 strip 
changes in value.  Since this derivative has been designated as a hedge of 
2002 all changes in market value are deferred in OCI (effective 1/1/01).

It represents a hedge of 2002 forecasted sales of TW over-retained 
fuel/unaccounted for volumes.  The swap will be initially recorded in January 
2001 at then market value as a FAS 133 implementation adjustment (any value 
at 1/1/2001 will go to income as an item of "change in accounting 
principles").   Monthly fluctuations in the value of the swap will be marked 
to market with the income effect deferred in Other Comprehensive Income until 
the hedged item (the physical sale) occurs.  The the deferred income will be 
undeferred and brought to income to offset the income/loss from the hedged 
transaction.

We sold short at $4.50?
That would mean we're already under water?

seems to address all important considerations. i would vote (manually) for a 
consistent apporach across all ETS managed activities. however i think it 
will receive resistence by selected project engineers - who tend to anly take 
respeonsiblity for a single facet of a project and not the whole project; and 
may think it slow down an already slow approval process

What do you think about using something like this proposal for most of our 
major projects (over $1.0 MM), could even go lower?   This has been proposed 
by Morris specifically for EOTT projects, but there is no reason to exclude 
others.

What do you think about using this proposed document for approving any EOTT

Here's my attempt at the template:
