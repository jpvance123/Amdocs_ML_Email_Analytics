I was deflated that my offer came in at flat bid, no signing bonus and no 1 year deal.  I'm still scheduled to meet with UBS to discuss.  No matter what, the news stories are disgusting me, so I'll probably take UBS, if only for washing machine effect.

Hi Scott,

Could I get the Var calculation for Bridgeline for October, November and December month end?  You may have previously sent this to Adarsh Vakharia, but I am not able to access his files.

Thanks,

Susie

The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.

The following guidelines must be followed:
?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.
?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. 
?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.  
?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. 
?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.    

If you have any questions please contact Richard Hensch at ext. 35522.

John,

Are you ready to learn your first control function.  The controls group is going to let us set up the new books we need for Netco today.  When you are ready let me know and we'll go down there, or they will come up here or whatever.

The only books that should still have deals in them, other than NG-Price, will be 

Intra-Ont-Cad		all canadian gas daily deals
NGPR-Can
Oil-NG-Spec
Ft-Ont-Central		all consolidated price/basis deals

these books will still have to be calculated after today.

All counterparty deals were moved over the weekend but any remaining desk to desk deals were not touched.  We need to move those ourselves today.
All others need to be calculated and officialized one more time today then inactivated on the Rac website for tomorrow.

Mike,

We will be setting up both physical and financial books for everyone.  I know not everyone will have physical but to keep it consistent everyone will have both just in case.  I have the 10 names you sent Jeff earlier, please let me know if that changes.  Do you know what the structure going to look like? ie.  will each trader be assigned specific curves/locations, cash vs. term, how many different people will be setting curves.

We will be starting over with our curve files also.  We want to only start with the true published curves.  We have many derived/internal curves that aren't necessary and if we need to create more curves we will look into it later.  Since the number of curves will be greatly reduced, we will probably start with one file.    

Thanks
Kam

Can you get together with Zach on Thursday or Friday and walk him through a simple book.  Take Jane Tholt's book and discuss Risk 101.


Send him an email with a time and place.

Kam, 

Yes, I can set up the new books if you can provide me the book short names and book codes.  But the book needs to be first set up in Global then I can set it up in Tagg/Erms.  Contact Cheryl Johnson to set up new books in Global.  Once she completed then I can finish the rest.

Call me if you have any questions.

Cecilia

Cecilia,

We need to get some new books set up in ERMS this week for Netco.  We will be taking over this responsibility from the controls group but they are reluctant to grant us access to RisktRAC now due to security reasons.  These books are needed for many downstream groups and therefore must be set up soon.  Can you set these up before they are in risktrac this time due to these limitations?  I can give you the book and portfolio codes and the TAGG short names.

Please let me know today so we can start ASAP.

Thanks

Kam

Diversified Product Inspections Inc.  (OTCBB: DPRI)

Immediate & Strong BUY Recommendation

Huge Analyst and Newsletter Coverage for DPRI                       

DPRI will be profiled by some major analysts and
newsletters along with the release of significant
news regarding explosive sales for the Company.
There will be huge volume and a strong increase in
price for several days. The same groups that featured
CPTH will begin coverage on DPRI. IONN exploded from
$ .37 to $1.84.  We know for certain that the same
groups are going to feature DPRI and even better
returns are expected.

DPRI, a 10-year old fully-reporting company, is a
leading provider of independent product investigations,
air contamination, and fire investigations for the
Insurance Industry.  The demand for the Company's
services has exploded due to present US conditions,
with DPRI servicing over 50 major Insurance carriers.
This has led to significant Revenue for the Company.

We are very proud that we can share this information
with you so that you can make a profit out of it. It
is highly advisable to take a position in DPRI as soon
as possible, today before the market closes or tomorrow.

The stock could easily reach $4.00 in less than a month
on the strength of their upcoming contract announcements
and Strong Analyst Buy Recomendations.

When word gets out this stock will SOAR!

Subject:	Deals to be moved to Bankruptcy Books (From Russell's Exposure Report)


The attached deal list are the deals behind those contracts, for those deals that are currently not included in the bankruptcy books. Please note that there are still several deals that I am trying to reconcile back to Sitara numbers. Assuming that I can do so, I will send supplemental information tomorrow afternoon.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any additional questions or concerns.

Thank you,
Cyndie

Susan,
attached is a new matrix for each desk.  This should replace the previous matrix you are using.  We are just putting our groups down in the access request list and this should be used to cross reference.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Susan,

These are book requests for the Netco books for all regions.

Please let me know if you have any questions.  We put in some book and portfolio codes we would like if they are available.  If not, please call me.  We need all price, basis, index, and gas daily US books to be the same, all Canadian books to be the same and all physical books to have the same codes please.

Thanks

Kam

Subject:	regions file

Thomas is setting up a new NGP&L file and would like us to save a copy of each P&L to Netco\2002\0102\region#0102.  Once you decide how you are going to break them up, one file for each book or combine them together, can you save them out there so he can start linking them.

I think that for the physical regions it may be easier to keep each book separate because people could be moving around a lot.

If you or your group have trouble printing, it may be that they moved a bunch a printers to \\nahou-psecn01v server. If you are on the the old server, you have to delete that printer from your printer set up and reinstall it by going through Start/run and typing in \\nahou-psecn01v, then select your printer. Thanks.

The IT group would like to turn off the replication of curves tomorrow.  Have all the ESTATE curve files been converted per the 
instructions below.  Any file that has not been updated will not be able to load curves effective Thursday.

If there is any problem with this timing, please contact me.

Subject:	Updating Curve Files to New Environment

Currently the curves are being published into the old production database and are being replicated to the new Estate environment.      



Here are the steps to migrate the Curve files to the new env.

1)	Load new ODBC driver utilizing script provided
      A) Go to ( Start\Programs\System Utility Applic \ Installation&Diskette Creation)
     Double click on "ODBC DSN Entries for ERMT & ESTERMTP"
              This will load the correct ODBC on your machine
  
  2)   On the Publish tab in the Curve File sheet.
Change the environment name on the 5th row to estermtp
Change the service name on the 5th row to 7550     

3) Then hit the  << OLE Object: Picture (Metafile) >>  button on the publish sheet and save the new file.
If the sheet does not have the button, just save the file, close it, and bring it back up.

4)	Save your curves as normal

5)	Any questions or problems, please give me a call

Do you or anyone else in your group get broker quotes on a daily basis to help set the curves?  If so, is there a spreadsheet kept with them that I can get?

Good morning,

This is the plan for today.

Over the weekend the IT group moved the remaining deals to the NG-price book.
This morning, copy and recalculate your post-id's from Friday, run a forwards detail (and options detail) to make sure your books have no deals in them.  If they do, let me know and we'll move those manually to NG-Price.
Once your books are completely empty, you can calc. those for tonight's P&L and officialize (no need to wait for curves anymore).
We will still have physical deals in all books for a few more days so you will still have to wait for physical curves to come out at night.

Transport model - I want to combine all transport pieces into one P&L (WC-Cal) starting tonight.
All other books, if you had a piece prior to today, make that zero tonight (term and intra-month)


We won't be doing much over the next week or two so this is a great time to ask questions.  If there is anything you guys would like to learn more about, please let me know.

Thanks

Kam

Check your regions and if you see any locations mapped to curves we won't be setting anymore, make a list of those and what the new mappings should be.  Once the new database is set up we will get with Russ to have those changed over.


Thanks

No Denver region.  The book was named after the office.  We can change the name and it will be a part of the west.

Mike,

Will there be a Denver region for Netco?  I have assumed that everything will be considered West but want to make sure before we set up the books.

Thanks

Hi Kam,

I am seeing a demand charge for January 2002 on deal 225912.  I am wondering if this is correct since the contract was terminated on 12/28/01.

Subject: Northern Natural Gas



Dear ETS Colleague: 

On Thursday, January 3, Enron entered into a settlement over Dynegy's exercise of its option to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline.  The settlement allows Dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while Enron pursues its damage claim against Dynegy.  

In this respect, Enron Corp. has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of Northern Natural Gas.  Consequently, Enron Corp. has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy, while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved.

The company has concluded that with this settlement, Enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly, as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court.  For the Northern Natural Gas employees, I believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable, successful business.

Beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe, reliable and efficient operation of Northern Natural Gas.  

Over many years we have run high quality, cost conscious and profitable businesses in ETS.  Keep up the good work! 

Stan

Kam,
The book-id itself can be any name as long it is a unique name. The -PRC or -IDX suffixes were added as a convinience so that the risk type can be identified by looking at the book-id. The book-type or risk-type code against the book-id in RisktRAC will define the risk type and the system does not depend on the name of the book-id to identify the risk type.

Regards,
Ramesh

It can be done either way, depending on your need. Those directories can be made available for both Estate and NetCo or only for one of them. You need to let us know how you want to be done. Currently, we are assuming that everything need to be accessible from both Estate and NetCo.

Thanks

Zhiyong

Z,

We have been making lists of the directories that need to be moved over with Netco.  Will these directories be moved so that the estate can't use them, or will copies be made so both groups could use the files?  If not, we will have to make copies and change the list we have put together already.


Thanks

Kam

Kam:

Regarding your question about having 1 Gas book (i.e. 1 portfolio/book code combination) with multiple org. regions vs. having multiple books 
with the same org. region (e.g. DESK), in terms of PortCalc performance, there is no difference between the 2 setups.

As you said in your voice mail, having one portfolio/book code combination provides more flexibility in terms of defining PortCalc mini-books.

Please keep in mind that Canadian-logic deals require separate Price/Index, GasDaily and Physical Intramonth books.

Thanks,
Jeremy

Fyi,

ubsenergy.com has been registered.  (so for all you trying to squat and extort money for the name, you're too late).  our company name is, reportedly, UBS Warburg Energy LLC

Building on the success of Infocast's recent Building New Nuclear Power Plants event, New Nuclear Power Plant Technology will explore in greater detail the reactor and other technologies that could be used in the next generation of nuclear power plants. The schedule will provide a half day on each major reactor class envisioned (advanced boiling water, high temperature gas-cooled, and pebble bed modular reactors), giving attendees an unprecedented opportunity to compare the technical features, potential costs, infrastructure needs, development risks, and performance traits of these technologies. The conference will also provide in-depth examinations of the issues surrounding the development of new nuclear technologies, the role of supporting technologies such as control room automation, and safety and licensing concerns.

I heard Pete Keavey and Darren Farmer, too.  Stephanie just told me that!  30 of the 39 people are still here in EOL.  I am not in charge...scary if I was.

Are you guys going to the Houstonian tomorrow for the Overview/Orientation?

FYI........

We will probably have some changes to the trader matrix, we have had some traders quit or decide to stay with the estate.  Once we know for sure, we will send you the new breakout.

Kam,

Per my voice mail, I believe that Sean Riordan is no longer with Enron, so I am not sure who might handle his function.  Just to follow up, I believe that the below deals should change accordingly...

Deal		Current CP			Should Be CP
927642		Coral Energy Canada, Inc.	Coral Energy Resources, L.P.
848014		Coral Energy Resources, L.P.	Coral Canada U.S., Inc.
851409		Coral Energy Resources, L.P.	Coral Canada U.S., Inc.

Please advise when complete or who might be able to assist.

Thanks,

Scott Dozier

Hi Scott,

Could I get the Var calculation for Bridgeline for October, November and December month end?  You may have previously sent this to Adarsh Vakharia, but I am not able to access his files.

Thanks,

Susie

Suzanne,

I was wondering if you had a chance to research the below note.  Furthermore, please note the updated file attached.  There are no changes volumetrically from the last file, but there are some price differences.  Basically, Coral has taken these deficiency charges in their final settlement with Nov-01 prod.  So, the need is to verify the correctness of their claim to these charges.  Please advise on what you might know about this from a scheduling point of view when possible.

Kam,

We talked briefly about this before the holidays.  The price problem we discusses has been cleared up by Coral.  However, I assume that you need to be in the loop to also verify the overall deficiency charges and ultimately approve the creation of demand charges on the appropriate deals.  Please let me know where you stand on this or what might be my next steps in cleaning this up.

Thanks,

Suzanne,

Here is the spreadsheet that we discussed earlier today.  The worksheet of concern is titled "Sched".  Each deal is listed by group.  That is to say that they are not listed by day, but the days in question are mentioned for each group.  Furthermore, the volumes on the left of each group are from Coral's data, whereas the right side contains ENA data or my calculations.  Please prioritize these as you can with the expectation that I might be able to work on this upon my return from vacation on Jan 2.

What time do you want to leave on Saturday?  I am boarding Yogi at Bissonett

The IT group would like to turn off the replication of curves tomorrow.  Have all the ESTATE curve files been converted per the 
instructions below.  Any file that has not been updated will not be able to load curves effective Thursday.

If there is any problem with this timing, please contact me.

Currently the curves are being published into the old production database and are being replicated to the new Estate environment.      



Here are the steps to migrate the Curve files to the new env.

1)	Load new ODBC driver utilizing script provided
      A) Go to ( Start\Programs\System Utility Applic \ Installation&Diskette Creation)
     Double click on "ODBC DSN Entries for ERMT & ESTERMTP"
              This will load the correct ODBC on your machine
  
  2)   On the Publish tab in the Curve File sheet.
Change the environment name on the 5th row to estermtp
Change the service name on the 5th row to 7550     

3) Then hit the  << OLE Object: Picture (Metafile) >>  button on the publish sheet and save the new file.
If the sheet does not have the button, just save the file, close it, and bring it back up.

4)	Save your curves as normal

5)	Any questions or problems, please give me a call

Attend the Power Marketing Association's Seventh Annual Spring Conference: Power Markets 2002: Risk and Reward, April 17-18, 2002, at the Excalibur Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada.

We will see record numbers of new powerplants coming on line this year. New, much larger RTOs promise dramatic increases in liquidity. The Enron fallout will continue to force balance sheet improvements-- perhaps more mergers and acquisitions. Price volatility will continue, and risk management techniques will continue to be honed. 

Come hear the experts who will help you survive and thrive in 2002!

kam,

i created a folder within Netco / West called "Summary P&L" and put the sum p&l and the phillip/mike email file in there.  fyi, neither report will work at the moment, as the macros are pointed to the old pnl's.  once the new pnl's are created, it won't be tough to get them running, just let me know.

thanks,
-rb

We are finalizing the list of files to be moved over to Netco today.  Please look in O:\erms\erms_adm\Netco\West and if there is a file you used to run, (price reports, the wood report, broker, desk to desk, consolidated P&L for the website, etc.) that you don't see out there now, please save a copy to this directory this morning.

If the central books have 2 set up then I'll leave MC assigned to GD and we need another set of central books set up for P/B/I.  Please have the new books set up in Global first (with new book codes, not MC) then email me the new IDs, book names, book codes and region codes.

The West books should be GD and GDY for Canadian deals.  I would think that the central books should have two set up, one for P/B/I and one for GD.  I believe I had called you and said that the books should be set up like FT-ONT-GDL for the gas daily books.  This is correct.  Thanks.

Phillip/Kam,

The following new Canadian gas books are all assigned to "MC" but a canadian book can either be price/basis/index or gasdaily but it cannot be both (otherwise cause problems in PortCalc).  I remember we discussed about this last time and I was told to use FT-ONTARIO as the example, but there are a lot of FT-ONTARIO books like FT-ONT-CENTRAL and FT-ONT-GDL with different setup.  

For example, 166860 has all P/B/Idx/GD checked which it shouldn't be.  And 166859 has GD checked so does it mean it should be set up as a Canadian gasdaily book?  Then if 166860 - 166877 are Canadian price/basis/index, another book code should be assigned instead of using MC.  Please advise.

Dear Kam,

As we discussed, it seems the best solution is to have the IT groups set up the books until the systems have been separated. 

Thanks

I'll make you a promise. READ THIS E-MAIL TO THE
END! - follow what it says to the letter - and you
will not worry whether a RECESSION is coming or
not, who is President,or whether you keep your
current job or not . Yes, I know what you are
thinking. I never responded to one of these before
either. One day

though, something just said "you throw away $25.00
going to a movie for 2 hours with your wife".
"What the heck." Believe me, no matter where you
believe "those feelings" come from, I thank
goodness every day that I had that feeling. I
cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be
doing had I not. Read on. It's true. Every word
of it. It is legal. I checked. Simply because you
are buying and selling something of value.

AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV:

Making over half a million dollars every 4 to 5
months from your home.

THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET !
==================================================
BE AN INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A
YEAR!!!

Before you say ''Bull'', please read the
following. This is the letter you have been
hearing about on the news lately. Due to the
popularity of this letter on the Internet, a
national weekly news program recently devoted an
entire show to the investigation of this program
described below, to see if it really can make
people money. The show also investigated whether
or not the program was legal.

Their findings proved once and for all that there
are ''absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the
participation in the program and if people can
"follow the simple instruction" they are bound to
make some mega bucks with only $25 out of pocket
cost''. DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY &
RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY
WORKING BETTER THAN EVER.

This is what one had to say: '' Thanks to this
profitable opportunity". I was approached many
times before but each time I passed on it. I am so
glad I finally joined just to see what one could
expect in return for the minimal effort and money
required. To my astonishment, I received a total $
610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming
in''. Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.
==================================================
Another said: "this program has been around for a
long time but I never believed in it. But one day
when I received this again in the mail I decided
to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple
instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the
money started to come in. First month I only made
$240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made a
total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months
by re-entering the program, I have made over
$710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to
success in this program is to follow the simple
steps and NOT change anything.'' More testimonials
later but first, =======

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

If you would like to make at least $500,000 every
4 to 5 months easily and comfortably, please read
the following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN !!!

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR
FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED!

INSTRUCTIONS:

===Order all 5 reports shown on the list below===

For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER
OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL
ADDRESS to the person whose name appears ON THAT
LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN
ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in
case of any mail problems.

===WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER, MAKE SURE === ===YOU
ORDER EACH OF THE 5 REPORTS! === You will need all
5 reports so that you can save them on your
computer and resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5 =
$25.00.

Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail,
each of the 5 reports from these 5 different
individuals. Save them on your computer so they
will be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's
of people who will order them from you. Also make
a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk
in case something happens to your computer.

IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people
who are listed next to each report, or their
sequence on the list, in any way other than what
is instructed below in step '' 1 through 6 '' or
you will loose out on the majority of your
profits. Once you understand the way this works,
you will also see how it does not work if you
change it. Remember, this method has been tested,
and if you alter it, it will NOT work !!! People
have tried to put their friends/relatives names on
all five thinking they could get all the money.
But it does not work this way. Believe us, some
have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened.
So Do Not try to change anything other than what
is instructed. Because if you do, it will not work
for you. Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!!
This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You are offering a
product for sale and getting paid for it. Treat it
as such and you will be VERY profitable in a short
period of time.

1.. After you have ordered all 5 reports, take
this advertisement and REMOVE the name & address
of the person in REPORT # 5. This person has made
it through the cycle and is no doubt counting
their fortune.

2..Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO
REPORT # 5.

3.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO
REPORT # 4.

4.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO
REPORT # 3.

5.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO
REPORT # 2

6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1
Position.

PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address
ACCURATELY! This is critical to YOUR success.

==================================================
**** Take this entire letter, with the modified
list of names, and save it on your computer. DO
NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.

Save this on a disk as well just in case if you
loose any data. To assist you with marketing your
business on the internet, the 5 reports you
purchase will provide you with invaluable
marketing information which includes how to send
bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of
free classified ads and much more. There are 2
Primary methods to get this venture going:

METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY
==================================================

Let's say that you decide to start small, just to
see how it goes, and we will assume You and those
involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's
also assume that the mailing receives only a 0.2%
(2/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much
better but let's just say it is only 0.2%). Also
many people will send out hundreds of thousands e-
mails instead of only 5,000 each). Continuing with
this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails.

With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for
report # 1. Those 10 people responded by sending
out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000. Out
of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with
orders. That's=100 people responded and ordered
Report # 2.

Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a
total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to
that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.

Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mail each for a
total of 5 million e-mail sent out. The 0.2%
response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.

Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each
for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails.
The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for
Report # 5.

THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00
(half a million dollars).

Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 +
2..... $500 + 3..... $5,000 + 4..... $50,000 +
5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00

NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND
FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO
MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A
LOT OF MONEY!
==================================================

REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE
ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think
for a moment what would happen if everyone or half
or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000 e-
mails each or more? There are over 150 million
people on the Internet worldwide and counting,
with thousands more coming on line every day.
Believe me, many people will do just that, and
more!

METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
==================================================

Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive
and there are hundreds of FREE places to
advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the
Internet will easily get a larger response. We
strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 and add
METHOD #2 as you go along. For every $5 you
receive, all you must do is e-mail them the Report
they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day
service on all orders.

This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out,
with your name and address on it, will be prompt
because they can not advertise until they receive
the report.

===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================
The reason for the "cash" is not because this is
illegal or somehow "wrong". It is simply about
time. Time for checks or credit cards to be
cleared or approved, etc. Concealing it is simply
so no one can SEE there is money in the envelope
and steal it before it gets to you.

ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.
Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for
each Report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the
cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2
sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of paper,
Write the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are
ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and
postal address.

$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$

Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:

=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for
Report #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails
until you do.

=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3
weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or
more for REPORT # 2. If you did not, continue
advertising or sending e-mails until you do.

**Once you have received 100 or more orders for
Report # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is
already working for you, and the cash will
continue to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO
REMEMBER: Every time your name is moved down on
the list, you are placed in front of a Different
report.

You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching
which report people are ordering from you. IF YOU
WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF
E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There
is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate from
this business !!!

=================================================

FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS
PROGRAM: You have just received information that
can give you financial freedom for the rest of
your life, with NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF
EFFORT. You can make more money in the next few
weeks and months than you have ever imagined.
Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not
change it in any way. It works exceedingly well as
it is now.

Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report
after you have put your name and address in Report
#1 and moved others to #2 .....# 5 as instructed
above. One of the people you send this to may send
out 100,000 ormore e-mails and your name will be
on every one of them. Remember though, the more
you send out the more potential customers you will
reach. So my friend, I have given you the ideas,
information, materials, and opportunity to become
financially independent. IT IS UP TO YOU NOW !

=============MORE TESTIMONIALS===============

'' My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in
Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S.
Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I
received this program I grumbled to Jody about
receiving ''junk mail''. I made fun of the whole
thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and
percentages involved. I ''knew'' it wouldn't work.
Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and
a few days later she jumped in with both feet. I
made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay
the old ''I told you so'' on her when the thing
didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3
weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the
next 45 days she had received total $ 147,200.00
........ all cash! I was shocked. I have joined
Jody in her ''hobby''. Mitchell Wolf M.D.,
Chicago, Illinois

================================================

'' Not being the gambling type, it took me several
weeks to make up my '' Not being the gambling
type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind
to participate in this plan. But conservative as I
am, I decided that the initial investment was so
little that there was just no way that I wouldn't
get enough orders to at least get my money back''.
'' I was surprised when I found my medium size
post office box crammed with orders. I made
$319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing
about this deal is that it does not matter where
people live. There simply isn't a better
investment with a faster return and so big''. Dan
Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada

=================================================

'' I had received this program before. I deleted
it, but later I wondered if I should have given it
a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to
get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-
mailed again by someone else.........11 months
passed then it luckily came again...... I did not
delete this one! I made more than $490,000 on my
first try and all the money came within 22
weeks''. Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y.

=================================================

'' It really is a great opportunity to make
relatively easy money with little cost to you. I
followed the simple instructions carefully and
within 10 days the money started to come in. My
first month I made $ 20, 560.00 and by the end of
the third month my total cash count was $
362,840.00. Life is beautiful, Thanx to the
internet''. Fred Dellaca, Westport, New Zealand

It would be total exposure, physical and financial, for gas, and then power separately, if you have access to that.  If not, forget power.  The date would be as of our bankruptcy, (Dec. 2nd?).  What did we owe them that we are not going to pay them?  What is our future exposure (MTM) as of now? (For a summer 2002 swap, for example.)  and what do they owe us if we haven't been paid?  We just need to be aware of how things ended with Enron so we can discuss it when we knock on their door as UBS.

Let me know what else you need and thanks for your help.

Kim, as part of the roll out plans we will need a summary report of the close out values for these customers.  Can you coordinate with credit, including the utilization of an analyst ( if you can find one). to complete this list.  

Cash means ( receivables, payables positions outstanding).
MTM ( the last MTM that we had with a company as we closed out).

The intent of compiling this information is to be able to position ourself for the appropriate conversation with this customer.... (if Enron owes them money, we should know that before we walk in the door). 



Pls review and let's discuss....

Genesis Capital Corporation of Nevada is traded OTCBB: 
GNCP

Stock Outstanding
Public Float  3,000,000 
54,110,309 shares owned by management

Background:
One of the fastest growing segments of the housing market
is the housing needs of people over the age of fifty-five.
While this is already a large portion of the population,
over the next few years, all baby boomers will, hopefully,
reach age fifty five. This age group is the most affluent
segment of the population and providing for their special
housing needs presents a significant profit opportunity.  

Both retirees and older adults who are still working favor
condominium development because they no longer wish to
maintain the exterior of their home or their grounds and
because of the greater feeling of security offered by a
condominium development. The type of housing preferred
in active adult communities is either attached or
semi-attached ranch houses. Senior homes, whether one or
two story have their master bedroom on the first floor.  

The active adult communities developed in Connecticut
have all sold very quickly. These communities range in
price from the mid one hundred thousands to townhouses
selling for over half a million dollars. Recently,
development of retirement communities has started in
Long Island in New York with some being priced in the
six and seven hundred thousand dollar range.  

The difficulty faced by developers is that sites for
active adult communities are hard to find since there
are very few sites zoned for condominium development. 
Furthermore any cluster development is very difficult
unless the town water and sewer are available to the
site. 


Towns are anxious to have senior developments for the
following reasons:
1. Senior development generates taxes but do not use
town resources such as schools, police, etc
2. Senior developments allow older residents to stay
in the community

Consequently towns will usually grant zoning changes for
senior housing developments.

>From a developer's point of view, senior housing is a
profitable, lower risk product for the following reasons:
1. Senior are usually cash buyers and are relatively
unaffected by changing interest rates.  
2. Seniors will pay more per square foot of housing than
other homebuyers; consequently, the profit margins are
generally larger.
3. Given the difficulty to find good sites, most approved
sites face little or no competition and sell very quickly. 

Despite the desirability and potential profitability of
active adult communities, the majority of towns in the
Northeast do not have any such communities due to the
difficulty of finding appropriate sites.  

Business Plan:  
To develop active adult communities consisting of
condominium developments which are restricted to residents
fifty-five years of age and over. The initial development
projects will occur in the northeast portion of the United
States. Thus far 5 towns in Connecticut have been chosen
for development of 300 to 400 condominium units. The
estimated sales price for each unit is between $175,000
and $250,000.  

Thru it's subsidiary Senior Lifestyle Communities Inc.,
GNCP owns or controls 5 sites:
East Windsor, Hebron, Watertown, New Milford, and Granby
The company business plan is to build out the condominium
units on the existing sites, and buy additional sites in
Connecticut and New York. Additionally the company plans
to acquire and merge with a Regional Construction company
so as to control costs of construction and accelerate the
time to finish the projects as well as participate in
revenues and profitability from other construction.     

Timing:
The land for each development is initially optioned 
for due diligence period during which site approval
is obtained, which includes zoning, land use, wetlands,
water and sewer approvals for the subject site. After
approvals are granted by the municipality then the
land purchase is consummated with the seller and the
land is purchased from the seller. Normal process would
then include an Acquisition and Development loan from
a local Bank for payment of the seller and payment
for development of the site including roads, water and
sewer to the property. Condominium units will mostly 
be presold to the condominium users and units will be
built with construction financing from a local Bank.  
Construction will be done by contracting out building
to a local bonded builder.  

It is anticipated that the permitting for development
of all sites will be achieved by the spring of 2002 and
5 sites could be under construction by summer of 2002

Phase One of Business Plan
Project No 1  	East Windsor	66 Units		$2,600,000
Project No 2	Hebron		50 Units		$2,000,000
Project No 3	Watertown	48 Units		$2,000,000
Project No 4	New Milford	45 Units		$2,000,000
Project No 5	Granby		78 Units		$3,000,000
	Total Projected Profit        $11,600,000
	CT Adult Communities, Inc     $5,800,000 	
	GNCP Projected Profit	      $5,800,000 	
	Projected Revenue Phase One   $57,400,000 	
        *Additional land for units available

The company has an agreement with CT Adult Condominiums
LLC, which calls for CT Adult Condominiums LLC to provide
the expertise, labor and coordination of the projects
from inception of finding the land thru selling of the
units for which CT Adult Condominiums LLC will receive
50% of the net profits of the projects done with CT
Adult Condominiums LLC. CT Adult Condominiums LLC is
an experienced land /condominium developer in Connecticut
area. CT Adult Condominiums LLC is not an affiliate of

Debbie,

The credit committee needs to get some information from us that I could use your help with.  Can I get a dump of the non-terminated deals into excel and I will format it from there.  The information they need to see are the counterparty name, cash flows (MTM value) and positions.
As always, they need it by 11:00 this morning so if you could let me know if this is something your group could provide me with I would appreciate it. 

Thanks

Kam

Regarding issue (1) below:

The reason I do not see MP and MD in ermt/estermtp is that the counterparties are not in global
and my script to check joins with tagg_global_cp also.

Since these are physical books with deals flowing from Sitara->CPR, we should be ok.

Kam,

I've been trying to clean up variances with Canada, and this is one of them.  The variance is really from September when these deals should have liquidated, but didn't.  The variance has been sitting in our Canada profit center, and I just moved it over to Management West in November (that's why the PMA log says Nov).  Please take another look at these deals.  I do think the variance is correct.  Please let me know if you agree.  I apologize for the date confusion.

Thanks,
Amanda

Can you please look at the last line for Management West?  Those deals are booked to the FT-CAND-EGSC book in Canada.  It wasn't reflected in our P&L's, it also didn't liquidate so it shouldn't be a variance.

Thanks

Hi!

First, I would like to say thanks for clearing so many variances last month.  It was greatly appreciated!  Here are the variances between the Risk P&L and the GL as of November 30.  Let me know if you have any questions.  FYI - I will be out of the office until December 31.

The following new Canadian gas books are all assigned to "MC" but a canadian book can either be price/basis/index or gasdaily but it cannot be both (otherwise cause problems in PortCalc).  I remember we discussed about this last time and I was told to use FT-ONTARIO as the example, but there are a lot of FT-ONTARIO books like FT-ONT-CENTRAL and FT-ONT-GDL with different setup.  

For example, 166860 has all P/B/Idx/GD checked which it shouldn't be.  And 166859 has GD checked so does it mean it should be set up as a Canadian gasdaily book?  Then if 166860 - 166877 are Canadian price/basis/index, another book code should be assigned instead of using MC.  Please advise.

Also as per our conversation with Kam, all PB-HDG books set up from the original list have been removed from the database as they were not supposed to be set up in Tagg/Erms.

Thanks,
Cecilia

Any updates on these issues?  Need to have the Canada P/B/I books details and also which book is for future and options.  We need this info before we can set up books in Netco production database.

Kam,

I will update the regions for the books.  Also please advise which gas book is for future and which one is for the options.  Same for commodity Crude, Unleaded, and Heating Oil (the future & options books for these 3 commodities could be the same and could be different.  But currently you only have 1 book set up for each of these 3 commodities).

After speaking with Kim Theriot in confirmations, we will not be using the RiskMantra entity, per the legal department.  All Canada to US deals should be booked ENA to ECC (using the new legal entities of course) rather than RiskMantra.  She is waiting on the final word about our new legal entity names, I will let you know what I hear. 

Thanks

Kam

Dawn,

At this stage, I haven't heard any indications we wouldn't continue to operate this way.  

One important thing here is that this 2 leg logic was never applied to the US counterparties we deal with - so we end up having to book a second leg on any deals we do with a Houston counterparty in EOL.  Since this was obviously considered to be worth doing for the US, I don't see why we wouldn't do it for Canada too - it would be a significant time saver.

Kam, Kathy and Brian,

Concerning the ECC - Riskmantra logic that EOL has in place to convert the transactions that are done with counterparties with ECC master agreements...are we going to continue this way of booking (2 legs)?  If so, can you review the list of counterparties that follows the "2-leg" logic and let me know if there need to be any additions or deletions?

Thanks,
Dawn

Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol "ENRNQ."  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.  Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC "Pink Sheets."

Jeff,

We won't be moving the physical deals this weekend.  Russ spoke with logistics, Kim Olinger, and she said they won't be able to schedule gas until they create new capacity tickets and that may take a while.  I left a message with Bob Superty to get his help with this on Monday.  If they can get their stuff done Monday Russ can have the deals moved that night.

FYI........

We will probably have some changes to the trader matrix, we have had some traders quit or decide to stay with the estate.  Once we know for sure, we will send you the new breakout.

This is what we have to look forward to.  We need to get all post-id's, for the live and bankruptcy books, and get those to Sanjeev Gupta to dump into excel.  Then try to tie those MTM values back to the Gross Book Balance we reported on the final NGP&L.  Once that ties, we will format the info to fit schedule B.

You can't wait, right?

kam,
 
i appreciate you letting me be out today on such short notice.  i'll be in tomorrow.  if you need info or anything from me, you can call my cell phone up to about 4 oclock, i'll be on the road.
 
i was working on that project for hal mckinney with james, but it was at a standstill pending them figuring stuff out about oracle odbc drivers... if it gets fixed, and he needs someone to continue testing while i'm out, i have access to that folder on my pc (O:\erms\docs\xl_estate).  
login:  rbhatia

i was helping ashley fay with the performance book yesterday as well, but i think she can manage it fine without me.
 
thanks again, see you tomorrow.

We know you have questions about recent events impacting Enron and our plans for the future.  Ongoing investigations and pending litigation have made it difficult, if not impossible, to share information in a timely manner.  While we can't address certain issues, we can tell you about our initial plans to move Enron forward and emerge from bankruptcy, and we are eager to do that.

We had planned to hold an all-employee meeting tomorrow, January 23, at the Hyatt Regency.  However, we don't want to subject you to the media frenzy that would certainly surround such a meeting, so we've decided to postpone it.  We are currently making arrangements to hold a series of employee meetings within the building to protect your privacy.  We will provide the date and times to you as soon as the logistics for those meetings are finalized.

Prior to the employee meetings, we will provide an overview of Enron's new organizational structure.  You can expect that memo shortly.

r data for the 31st.

Over the next day or so, based on the below, I will be following up with ea=
ch of you to determine if there is any VAR or counterparty risk that was no=
t captured and then asking you to officialize the 12/31 books so we can pic=
k up the complete information for the 31st.  I will then put together a dea=
dline to get it done so I can rerun VAR.

Thanks for your cooperation.  If you have any questions or comments, please=
 call me at X39123.

Thanks,

Shona

Quick question:

I was wondering if you know anyone who could benefit
from a better understanding of energy derivatives, risk 
 management policy, gas-to-electricity arbitrage, statistics or 
 electric power trading.  
 
 If you do, please make them aware of  PGS Energy Training's
upcoming seminars in downtown Houston (in February) and
downtown Philadelphia (March). 
 http://www.pgsenergy.com/schedule.html
 
Available seminars include:
    1) Fundamentals of Energy Futures, Options & Derivatives
    2) Fundamentals of the Electric Power Industry
    3) Gas-to-Electricity Arbitrage & How to Maximize the
        Profitability of Electric Generation Assets
    4) Developing Effective Risk Management Policies
        & Procedures (John Wengler)
    5) Fundamentals of Statistical Analysis (Dr. Ken Skinner)
    6) How to Value Electric Generation Assets as Real Options 
    7) Fundamentals of Value-at-Risk (Soli Forouzan)
 
For seminar dates and hotel information, call 412-279-9298 
or visit  http://www.pgsenergy.com/schedule.html
 
 You can also save money by bringing a group of 4 or more. 
 With a group rate, your cost for $1,295 seminars is reduced 
 to $895 per attendee-- a savings of $1,600 from regular 
 prices. The group price for the $695 programs is $495.
 
As you know, successful people invest the they time need to
improve their career prospects and increase their value to
their organization.  Hope to see you there!

The files for the broker quotes have been moved from the Netco file to O:\erms\1intra\broker quotes.  Those will be used for the estate.

Please let anyone else who used those files know to start saving them to the new files starting today.

Thanks

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee. However, because these buses passes are fully subsidized they must be treated as "taxable" income. Excluding the first $65 of the bus pass, the remaining value is subject to taxation, collectively referred to as "imputed tax". See example below

Example: A $100 pass is chosen by an employee. 

Subsidy for Bus Pass		$100.00
Exclusion amount			$  65.00

Taxable Income amount		$  35.00

The IT group would like to turn off the replication of curves tomorrow.  Have all the ESTATE curve files been converted per the 
instructions below.  Any file that has not been updated will not be able to load curves effective Thursday.

If there is any problem with this timing, please contact me.

Thanks

Subject:	Updating Curve Files to New Environment

Currently the curves are being published into the old production database and are being replicated to the new Estate environment.      



Here are the steps to migrate the Curve files to the new env.

1)	Load new ODBC driver utilizing script provided
      A) Go to ( Start\Programs\System Utility Applic \ Installation&Diskette Creation)
     Double click on "ODBC DSN Entries for ERMT & ESTERMTP"
              This will load the correct ODBC on your machine
  
  2)   On the Publish tab in the Curve File sheet.
Change the environment name on the 5th row to estermtp
Change the service name on the 5th row to 7550     

3) Then hit the  << OLE Object: Picture (Metafile) >>  button on the publish sheet and save the new file.
If the sheet does not have the button, just save the file, close it, and bring it back up.

4)	Save your curves as normal

5)	Any questions or problems, please give me a call

GNSS as a long candidate.=20

GNSS gaps over resistance at 70 so the move constitutes a breakout. BRCM di=
d the same thing today taking resistance at 50. a close beneath the 13-day =
EMA constitutes the roving cautionary flag as GNSS has had an excellent rel=
ationship with the 13-day EMA since the green bar birthed in november. GNSS=
 has not closed beneath the 13-day EMA since. so the 13-day EMA is the yard=

Kristen,

Once Zhiyong gets me the information, how would you like this handled?  Do you want me to fill out the Schedule A, or would you rather have pivot tables similar to Todd Hall's for each scenario?

The IT group would like to turn off the replication of curves tomorrow.  Have all the ESTATE curve files been converted per the 
instructions below.  Any file that has not been updated will not be able to load curves effective Thursday.

If there is any problem with this timing, please contact me.

Thanks

Subject:	Updating Curve Files to New Environment

Currently the curves are being published into the old production database and are being replicated to the new Estate environment.      



Here are the steps to migrate the Curve files to the new env.

1)	Load new ODBC driver utilizing script provided
      A) Go to ( Start\Programs\System Utility Applic \ Installation&Diskette Creation)
     Double click on "ODBC DSN Entries for ERMT & ESTERMTP"
              This will load the correct ODBC on your machine
  
  2)   On the Publish tab in the Curve File sheet.
Change the environment name on the 5th row to estermtp
Change the service name on the 5th row to 7550     

3) Then hit the  << OLE Object: Picture (Metafile) >>  button on the publish sheet and save the new file.
If the sheet does not have the button, just save the file, close it, and bring it back up.

4)	Save your curves as normal

5)	Any questions or problems, please give me a call 

Russ

Subject:	NETCO access to RisktRAC

Looks like we have an issue with RisktRAC access.  In order to be able to set up books in RisktRAC, the only role that currently exists is the Risk Controls group, who has access to all books, hierarchies etc (all groups, all commodities).  With NetCo coming on line, the Risk Controls group has been asked to approve RisktRAC access to the new NetCo controls group so they can set up the new gas books that have been requested.  I am uncomfortable granting access to NetCo personnel, as they would be able to see all the estate info, including Europe, EIM, EGM, ENA etc.  Also, it is my understanding that the IT groups are working on splitting out the systems but will not be able to do so until after these books have to be set up (deadline for them is next Monday).  As such, I recommend the following: 

In order to ensure there is a segration between NetCo and the estate, until the systems are segregated, the IT groups should be responsible for setting up books, curves etc.

How does that sound?

Thanks

Shona Wilson

AMERICAN EXPRESS MEMBERSHIP REWARDS ANNOUNCEMENT

All Membership Rewards accounts were cancelled when American Express cancelled the Enron/American Express Corporate Cards.  To redeem Membership Rewards Points earned, the Corporate Card Account must be paid to a zero balance.  Upon paying the account  to a zero balance you have two options to redeem the points:

1)  Establish a Personal Card account with American Express and have the points that were accrued on the Corporate Card transferred to the Personal Card.  To apply for a Personal Card over the phone you can call 1-800-The-Card (843-2273).  Cardmembers must transfer Membership Rewards points to the new card by March 1, 2002.

2) If you do not have a Personal Card and do not want to establish a Personal Card, you should call the American Express Membership Rewards Redemption Line at 1-800-297-3276 and ask to speak with the Executive Consumer Relations Desk.  You should identify yourself as an Enron employee and request that your Membership Rewards be reinstated.  Reinstated points must be redeemed before March 1, 2002.  

For information on all travel services, please contact Tracy Ramsey at (713) 853-6457.

All -
 
Starting Wednesday, we all have lots of work to do to get the new company up and running on time.  Going forward,  we need to be a proactive organization as opposed to a reactive organization.  Given that we have the best people in the organization going over, this should not be difficult to accomplish.
 
Let me be very clear.  Playing on the internet will not be tolerated.  There is too much that has to get done over the next two weeks.  That message needs to be communicated to everyone going to the new company.  If people feel like they do not have anything to do,  they should be reading about options or the gas business.  This is a great opportunity for people to make themselves better employees.  I have no problem changing the lists if someone steps up,  or if someone doesn't.  
 
Below,  are a few things I need your help with over the next few days.

(i)    Budget (due Jan 2, 2002)                                                 
        First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized) 

Each of you needs to draw up a budget for your region by the end of the day Wednesday.  Use the format that we used for the Enron 2002 Budget process.  Russ and Greg.  You will be one cost center in the new organization.

John,  can you be responsible for coordinating this and compiling all budgets into one by Wednesday night?




(ii)     Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 3)                               To be forwarded to Louise       
        These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.     

I need to detailed plans for what files we are moving,  the systems we need,  and anything that will make the move better for the business.

Kam - Can you coordinate and give me the list be Thursday evening?

(iii)   Seating Plans                                                   Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate 
        We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.

If you have any preferences in this area let me know ASAP, so that I can make requests now.

(iv)    Due Diligence 
        We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

Just so you know, there will be more people in this week.

Please let me know how I can help in getting everything done.  I look forward to a great year working with all of you.  Thanks for all of your hard work.

 

Jeff

Kam -

I want all the regional portfolio codes to be the same.  One for price, Basis, Index, Gas Daily.  A different one for physical.

And then a seperate one on the financial desk.  Let me know if you disagree.

Have you started to set up any new books for NetCo. yet?

Do you guys think we should all use the same book and portfolio codes this time to make mini-books easier?
Also, I think we should have some consistency in book names (make them more descriptive).  any other suggestions?

Thank you.

Please take note of the change to the referenced file. Chuck Ames's FB-EAST6 book used the ERMS GCP ID 166846 in error. The file listed below uses the correct Sitara GCP ID of 167081. Thanks.

With the Enron debacle dominating not just the business page, but the front page, it seems like a good opportunity to look at two recent books that speak to the problems of corporate accountability (or lack thereof), Corporate Irresponsibility <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0300090234/ref=mk_del_256931_39> and The Divine Right of Capital <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1576751252/ref=mk_del_256931_40>. Also, Joseph Badaracco's Leading Quietly <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1578514878/ref=mk_del_256931_41> gets on my shortlist of candidates for best business book of the year. This is a leadership book that takes its cue not from the boardrooms of corporate America, but from the more mundane situations and decisions that most of us face in business every day. Also featured in this mailing is a list of the top 10 business books of 2001 as selected by the editors of Harvard Business Review <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005U5EB/ref=mk_del_256931_42>.

by Joseph L. Badaracco 
Most books on business leadership tend to focus on the high-profile Fortune 500 types--the Jack Welches, the Bill Gateses, and the Michael Dells. According to Joseph Badaracco, however, this view of leadership is incredibly narrow because it ignores the fact that "the vast majority of problems calling for leadership are everyday situations" faced by managers up and down the corporate hierarchy. In Leading Quietly <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1578514878/ref=mk_del_256931_45> Badaracco uses real-life examples to illustrate eight guidelines of what quiet leadership means.

by Bill Jensen 
Bill Jensen turns the tables on corporate management and asks, "Why should we work for you?" For Jensen, the answer goes way beyond compensation and benefits. In Work 2.0 <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0738205699/ref=mk_del_256931_50>, he lays out a new contract based on the realization that in this networked and knowledge-based economy, employees are a company's number-one asset and its most important investor.

by Jagdish Sheth, Rajendra Sisodia 
McDonald's, Burger King, and Wendy's; Bank of America, Chase Manhattan, and Bank One; American, United, and Delta. What do these companies have in common? In The Rule of Three <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/074320560X/ref=mk_del_256931_55> Jagdish Sheth and Rajendra Sisodia show why every market is dominated by three big players, and those companies who aren't specialists serving well-defined niches will either be swallowed up or destroyed. Here's a well-researched and original study of market dynamics that offers a new perspective on how markets really work.

Rob Adams is not one to mince words. In A Good Hard Kick in the Ass <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0609609505/ref=mk_del_256931_60> the Texas-based venture capitalist aims to smash the illusions and wishful thinking that drive so many entrepreneurs. The gist of Adams's book is this: building a successful business is not about great ideas; it's about execution of business fundamentals.

In the Wake of Enron 	
  <http://g-images.amazon.com/images/G/01/delivers/horizi.gif>
  <http://g-images.amazon.com/images/G/01/delivers/shadow.gif>

In the future, the Enron debacle may be seen as a fitting epitaph to the stock boom and bust of the last few years. Enron's maniacal focus on pumping up the bottom line to lift its stock price has left many investors wondering whether or not other companies have "Enroned" their financial results. For others, the Enron collapse is yet another confirmation of what's wrong with corporate America's preoccupation with enhancing shareholder value at the expense of social and ethical obligations. This selection of books not only considers the role of corporations, but offers help in evaluating what companies actually disclose about themselves and their business.

Corporate Irresponsibility: America`s Newest Export <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0300090234/ref=mk_del_256931_85>     Icon <http://g-images.amazon.com/images/G/01/icons/icon-books.gif>
by Lawrence E. Mitchell 
In Corporate Irresponsibility <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0300090234/ref=mk_del_256931_86> Lawrence Mitchell believes that the focus on short-term results and the legal system that supports them have blinded companies from acting in responsible ways toward their employees, the environment, and the political system--ultimately undermining those companies' long-term survival. Mitchell's suggestions for reform include annual, rather than quarterly, earning reports; increasing incentives for long-term stockholding; and separating corporate management from stockholder pressure.

The Divine Right of Capital: Dethroning the Corporate Aristocracy <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1576751252/ref=mk_del_256931_90>     Icon <http://g-images.amazon.com/images/G/01/icons/icon-books.gif>
by Marjorie Kelly 
Marjorie Kelly takes a radical view of the modern corporation. She believes that the mandate to maximize shareholder returns has created an aristocracy in which shareholders own corporations, but "contribute very little, and take quite a lot." In her view, employees--who are responsible for creating the wealth of the corporation--don't receive a fair reward for their labor, and are in fact "not citizens of corporate society, but subjects" (something former Enron employees might identify with). While I doubt many corporate leaders will be lining up to support Kelly's call for a truly "democratic capitalist system," her views in the wake of the Enron case will surely get a second hearing.

Kam, 

I think I may have deleted those notes about the morning reports.  Bruce, Brad and PLove all had copies of that stuff.  I'll check with my home computer and see if I still have a copy there.  I'll email it to you tonight if I do.

Kam,
 
Not sure who will be running the highly acclaimed Rox-Mgmt book in my absence, so i thought i'd just send some info to you.  
 
Use the copy post id icon on my desktop.  Login = mgmt-rox.  When the id's copy, you will have to go to the gas daily index post id's for ft-pge and mgmt-west (i think its those 2, its the last 2 id's on the sheet), for some reason the liquidation is turned on, just change it to 0.  Make sure the fiz dates are correct.
 
I do not use meta calc, so each id will need to be calced and officialized in port calc individually.  sorry.  
 
For weapon X, the directory is in H, the folder is called something like !weapon X, should be the first folder in the H directory.  WACOG is 2.175.
 
Transport number to be entered into the P&L is Leg 83, called "West/Allen" on the transport model.  0's should be entered in for both the mgmt-west and wc-rox basis options.
 
Hedge strips should be fine.  Print out the "WC-ROX" and "MGMT-WEST" sheets, don't worry about the "MGMT - NO OPTION" sheet.  
 
i think thats about it...  i wanted to talk to you when i get back on wednesday about maybe taking some columns out of my p&l.  i.e. the basis options and mgmt-west index and gd index.  i figure now is a good time to do stuff like that.  Then again, maybe its not worht the trouble if we'll be setting up all new stuff if we get bought.  I mean when.  When we get bought.
 
though i won't be at work monday and tuesday, i will be in/around Houston, and accessible by mobile phone or pager.  Feel free to contact me if you need to, really, its ok.
 
Thanks,
-randy

iRV, Inc. Announces Intent to Acquire Scarab Systems, Inc., Smart CardPayment Solution Provider
BOULDER, Colo., Dec 13, 2001 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- The Board of Directors of iRV, Inc. (OTC Bulletin Board: IRVV) is pleased to announce that the company has signed a non-binding letter of intent to acquire Scarab Systems, Inc., a privately held Nevada corporation. Scarab Systems is engaged in the distribution and sale of smart card payment systems for applications in e-commerce, banking, telecommunications, security and personal data transfer. The acquisition will proceed subject to completion of specific terms and conditions to be laid out in a definitive agreement. The transaction is also subject to the completion by Scarab Systems of a private placement and other customary conditions. 

Scarab Systems, Inc. has a license to provide rechargeable stored value smart cards for private label applications that the cardholder can load from a designated banking account via the Internet or via designated Automated Banking Machines (ABM). The funds can be withdrawn from most ATMs worldwide, or the stored value can be used to purchase goods and services anywhere that VISA is accepted, whether online or in brick and mortar businesses. Scarab's payment solutions operate on existing network infrastructures. Unlike many other smart card systems, Scarab's program uses existing processing and billing platforms and encryption technology, which work with existing POS and ATM systems. This technology helps eliminate the usual cost-prohibitive infrastructure required to set up a smart card program. 

"Scarab Systems licensed technology provides exciting prospects for innovative payment solutions that we feel represent a valuable contribution in iRV's strategy of expanding its technological asset base. The acquisition of Scarab represents a critical step in the process of implementing technologies that deliver recurring revenue," stated Clifford C. Thygesen, President of iRV, Inc. 

"The public market allows the investment community the opportunity to share in the exciting growth that Scarab Systems and the smart card industry is experiencing. The revised corporate structure will help accelerate the rollout of Scarab's payment system technologies," stated Thomas Mills, President of Scarab Systems. 

The smart card industry continues to experience tremendous growth. Each year card sales continue to set records, as the market is poised for enormous prosperity in the new millennium. Smart card sales at $274 Million in 1996 are estimated to be $5 Billion in 2003 (Frost & Sullivan). It is estimated that the industry as a whole will continue to grow at a rate between 30% and 50% annually for the foreseeable future (SBJ Research).

Yes.  Essentially, their claim is that we were to keep whole the deals in question.  That is why I got Suzanne involved.  From a big picture standpoint - Coral has supposedly taken this charge in their termination calculations.  However, I have yet to see any cash or notice to actually pay this to them in cash.  So, it is really a matter of bookkeeping.  In the mean time, I am trying to track down their termination calculations and their relation to this item.

Just so I understand correctly,  for the dollars in green, we are to pay Coral this amount as demand charges?

Suzanne,

I was wondering if you had a chance to research the below note.  Furthermore, please note the updated file attached.  There are no changes volumetrically from the last file, but there are some price differences.  Basically, Coral has taken these deficiency charges in their final settlement with Nov-01 prod.  So, the need is to verify the correctness of their claim to these charges.  Please advise on what you might know about this from a scheduling point of view when possible.

Kam,

We talked briefly about this before the holidays.  The price problem we discusses has been cleared up by Coral.  However, I assume that you need to be in the loop to also verify the overall deficiency charges and ultimately approve the creation of demand charges on the appropriate deals.  Please let me know where you stand on this or what might be my next steps in cleaning this up.

Thanks,

Suzanne,

Here is the spreadsheet that we discussed earlier today.  The worksheet of concern is titled "Sched".  Each deal is listed by group.  That is to say that they are not listed by day, but the days in question are mentioned for each group.  Furthermore, the volumes on the left of each group are from Coral's data, whereas the right side contains ENA data or my calculations.  Please prioritize these as you can with the expectation that I might be able to work on this upon my return from vacation on Jan 2.

Hi Kam,
 
Could you send us your updated address?  Yahoo says you still live on 4444 Westheimer, which I know is wrong.  We would like to send you a wedding invite.  Have a happy holiday.
 
Take care,
 
JR

Suzanne,

I was wondering if you had a chance to research the below note.  Furthermore, please note the updated file attached.  There are no changes volumetrically from the last file, but there are some price differences.  Basically, Coral has taken these deficiency charges in their final settlement with Nov-01 prod.  So, the need is to verify the correctness of their claim to these charges.  Please advise on what you might know about this from a scheduling point of view when possible.

Kam,

We talked briefly about this before the holidays.  The price problem we discusses has been cleared up by Coral.  However, I assume that you need to be in the loop to also verify the overall deficiency charges and ultimately approve the creation of demand charges on the appropriate deals.  Please let me know where you stand on this or what might be my next steps in cleaning this up.

Thanks,

Suzanne,

Here is the spreadsheet that we discussed earlier today.  The worksheet of concern is titled "Sched".  Each deal is listed by group.  That is to say that they are not listed by day, but the days in question are mentioned for each group.  Furthermore, the volumes on the left of each group are from Coral's data, whereas the right side contains ENA data or my calculations.  Please prioritize these as you can with the expectation that I might be able to work on this upon my return from vacation on Jan 2.

Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

Ken Lay

My memory needs refreshing as I'm noticing curve type codes and risk type codes that I don't know.

Curve Type Code:
AP
AV
BP
BV
PR
SP
VO

Book type code:
D
I
M
P
X

I should probably be shot for forgetting this stuff, but your help will be appreciated.
Thanks
Frank

Kam,

I will update the regions for the books.  Also please advise which gas book is for future and which one is for the options.  Same for commodity Crude, Unleaded, and Heating Oil (the future & options books for these 3 commodities could be the same and could be different.  But currently you only have 1 book set up for each of these 3 commodities).

Kam,

Could you please provide us with the calculations  and post IDs of the following books using the same criteria that you used for the Bankruptcy book:

	FT US CAN
	FT Canada
	FT Ontario (Canadian)
	FT Intra Ontario

I know that you may not run all these books, but could you help me find the applicable people so that we may obtain the same information that you provided to us on the Bankruptcy book.

All -
 
Starting Wednesday, we all have lots of work to do to get the new company up and running on time.  Going forward,  we need to be a proactive organization as opposed to a reactive organization.  Given that we have the best people in the organization going over, this should not be difficult to accomplish.
 
Let me be very clear.  Playing on the internet will not be tolerated.  There is too much that has to get done over the next two weeks.  That message needs to be communicated to everyone going to the new company.  If people feel like they do not have anything to do,  they should be reading about options or the gas business.  This is a great opportunity for people to make themselves better employees.  I have no problem changing the lists if someone steps up,  or if someone doesn't.  
 
Below,  are a few things I need your help with over the next few days.

(i)    Budget (due Jan 2, 2002)                                                 
        First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized) 

Each of you needs to draw up a budget for your region by the end of the day Wednesday.  Use the format that we used for the Enron 2002 Budget process.  Russ and Greg.  You will be one cost center in the new organization.

John,  can you be responsible for coordinating this and compiling all budgets into one by Wednesday night?




(ii)     Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 3)                               To be forwarded to Louise       
        These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.     

I need to detailed plans for what files we are moving,  the systems we need,  and anything that will make the move better for the business.

Kam - Can you coordinate and give me the list be Thursday evening?

(iii)   Seating Plans                                                   Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate 
        We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.

If you have any preferences in this area let me know ASAP, so that I can make requests now.

(iv)    Due Diligence 
        We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

Just so you know, there will be more people in this week.

Please let me know how I can help in getting everything done.  I look forward to a great year working with all of you.  Thanks for all of your hard work.

 

Jeff

FROM:  Enron Property & Services Corp

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee.  

For employees who park in the Allen Center, Met, or Enron Center garage, new parking rates are in effect beginning with the January 31st paycheck.  Rates for 2002 have increased by $5 for unreserved and $10 for reserved spaces.  This increase is consistent with first of the year rate increase obligations in Enron's parking lease agreements with the garage operators.  Enron is continuing to subsidize employee parking for Enron lease garages.  

Direct parking costs to employees are as follows:
Enron Center Unreserved	2001 Employee Cost - $94 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $99 per month	
Enron Center Reserved 4th Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $215 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $225 per month	
Enron Center Reserved 3rd & 5th Floors	2001 Employee Cost - $165 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $175 per month	
Allen Center Unreserved	2001 Employee Cost - $94 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $99 per month	
Allen Center Reserved 3rd Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $215 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $225 per month	
Allen Center Reserved 4th Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $165 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $175 per month	


Please note that effective January 31st only the Enron Center and Allen Center Garages will be available for Enron employee parking.  To request parking or to switch to these garages please call Parking and Transportation at ext. 37060 or ext. 36399.

If you have any questions about Bus Passes or Parking, please call Martin Katz at ext. 59322.

FB-CHICAGO
PB-CHICAGO

Please provide me the GCP ids.  Also you have 2 PB-WEST10 listed on your spreadsheet and please advise which id is the final.

I'll update the id on our side once I hear from you.

Thanks,
Cecilia

Cecilia,

Attached you will find an updated listing out the GCP id's that we will be using.  These will also be the same GCP id's used by EOL on the gas side.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  

John

Do you want to keep any of the old TRV files for Netco for any reason.  We can create new ones once it is set up.

I don't know who has been saving these daily.  Can you tell whoever on the west desk to use the new file instead.  They are for the estate and need to keep them away from the Netco files.

The files for the broker quotes have been moved from the Netco file to O:\erms\1intra\broker quotes.  Those will be used for the estate.

Please let anyone else who used those files know to start saving them to the new files starting today.

Thanks

Kam
