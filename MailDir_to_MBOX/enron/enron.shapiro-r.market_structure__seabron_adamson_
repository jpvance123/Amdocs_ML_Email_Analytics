Jim/Rick/Steve:

Please see the attached draft. I think I have everything in there we
discussed. Sorry I this has been slower than planned -as I mentioned before
I have been facing a family medical problem.

I will be out of the office for much of the next two days. I can be reached
at (617) 513-5904 (cellphone) or via email. I should be back in the office
full-time from Thursday a.m.

Cheers

The East desk's No. 1 priority for RTOs is The Real Time Energy Market (no 
day ahead balanced schedule requirement).  This means that the RTO should 
post the supply and demand curve with real time prices (the best example at 
this time is PJM's real time market).  A real time energy market is 
fundamental for customers to get proper real time price signals upon which to 
base their decisions to hedge or not on a forward basis.  It also provides 
the proper price signals to the market on where generation and transmission 
is needed.  Getting a real time energy market would advance Enron's ability 
to provide more financial tools to customers.  This market can be nodal (or 
zonal) in order to send location based price signals (for example, to NY 
City), with the ability to aggregate from nodal to zone determined "proxy 
buses."

While Kevin prefers the physical flowgate model with an option to collect 
congestion revenues (rather than an obligation, similar to the PJM FTRs now), 
the method of determining the congestion management is secondary to the 
establishment of the real time energy market.  Regulatory people should use 
their judgment (and talk with the desk) when determining how far to push 
option-type flowgates, rather than obligation-type FTRs.  Such a physical 
market transmission/congestion market can support a financial trading overlay.

If you do have an FTR type system, there should be an upfront allocation to 
load.  Ideally, the load should have an "network" right from the generator to 
their load (or from load to the "hubs") in order to have the ability to 
manage the congestion risk in the forward market when serving end use 
customers (EES) or for the ENA full requirements deals.  The nodes should be 
grouped into logical "zones" and congestion within a zone should be uplifted. 
This allocation to customers (or full blown auction of all rights) becomes 
critical in Enron's ability to serve load and all requirements customers.  
Without the proper allocation (not to incumbent utilties), the risk premium 
to serve these customers becomes too high and can't be priced. 

Finally, the market should have no price caps and preferably no icap market 
like NEPOOL (prefer PJM's system where the load has to show the RTO that it 
has contracted for enough reserves.)  We have urged the FERC in Florida to 
adopt a reserve monitoring system, whereby customers are not penalized for 
lack of icap unless they actually go under the reserve requirement, then they 
are required to purchase icap for a certain amount of time until they 
demonstrate continued compliance.

Bottom line -- "Do not let the perfect be the enemy of the good."  Congestion 
does not need to be perfectly allocated to each load if that mechanism is 
done in a manner that precludes Enron and others from developing efficient 
real time energy markets that send a locational hourly price signal to the 
generation (supply) and the load (demand).  This type of market will provide 
greater services to customers and allow Enron to grow its business.  

Finally, as we work toward this goal, remember that in the absence of a 
real-time energy market, we need to continue to focus our efforts on 
non-discriminatory treatment with respect to transmission (no native load 
exception) and parking and lending, scheduling flexibility, etc.

Rick,

Some comments from Nick are attached below.

Nick's first comment reflects a general concern I had about the paper which 
was it's treatment of imbalance settlement.  I would see this as one of the 
essential elements of market design.  I've always felt that the 
physical/financial distinction was slightly artificial because even with 
"physical" contracts, power systems must have a means for cash settlement of 
imbalances (in the absence of universal controls which limit actual takes to 
contract volumes).  However, the paper does not really pick this up and in 
section 3.1 implies that cash settlement might only be "feasible" in some 
market structures.  I would have added imbalance settlement to section 2.1 
which describes the fundamentals required for any market.  It would also help 
to draw a brighter distinction between spot markets and imbalance settlement.

At the same time I would have dropped the mention of "binding market rules" 
from 2.1.  I'd see this as a subset of the need for an ISO to take over the 
operation of the system in real time rather than as a separate fundamental 
principle.  It's also not made clear in what sense these commitments are 
binding.  Are they binding in a financial sense (in which case they are 
covered by imbalance settlement) or somehow physically (either this is 
unfeasible since units trip etc or it requires some form of balancing penalty 
which is ruled out later in the paper).

I felt that the paper also compounded issues such as LMP's/transmission 
rights with other non-locational elements of market design, this makes it 
difficult to follow in places.  It would be clearer to have the locational 
elements addressed separately as an adjunct to the basic principles.

Centralised unit commitment is put up as an element of the model proposed.  
As Nick hints at below, we wouldn't see this as an essential element of 
market design.  Under NETA, individual participants commit their own units 
with the SO only taking over full control at 3.5 hours out.  Even with 
centralised commitment, I'm not convinced that simple bidding would be 
superior to multi-part bids.  Much here depends on timescales, eg, a 
day-ahead market with simple bids is more exposed to allocative inefficienc 
than a continuous hourly market with simple bids.  Simple bidding was often 
proposed for the Pool, but I think a single daily big would have increased 
prices if two-shifting generators had not been able to reflect their start-up 
and no-load costs separately.  (These elements were also gamed, although this 
game eroded as competition increased.)

Specific UK sensitivities which you may want to finesse in the paper:

? we've consistently opposed locational pricing because of our Teesside 
positions.  Publicly we've argued that the proposals do not provide good 
economic signals over sufficiently long time-periods to enhance allocative 
efficiency and that the transactions costs outweigh any possible efficiency 
gains (constraints only cost about o20m pa here).  Despite arguing our 
commercial position, I'm quite happy with this approach and am genuinely 
sceptical about the benefits of locational pricing in the UK.  This position 
would of course change in much larger, sparse and less-interconnected 
networks such as exist in parts of the US.
? Our fall back position is that any locational pricing scheme in the UK must 
preserve pre-existing implied rights for generators, ie, grandfathering.  I 
recognise that this can be a barrier to competition in some networks with 
imcumbent market power, but I don't think that this is as big an issue in the 
UK (where competition already exists) as it is on the Contintent and in the 
US.

Hope these help, let me know if you want to discuss further.

Paul

Subject: Frontier Economics' Whitepaper

Paul,

Here's some comments on Frontier's whitepaper. Do you want to discuss them? 

Section 3.1
The distinction between cash and physical settlement of forward contracts is 
blurred. Under NETA contract settlement is achieved by contract notification 
to Elexon. Even then a party doesn't need to deliver on the contract - it 
could cash out at the imbalance price. However, in practice NETA is more 
similar to physical settlement since imbalance price volatility means Parties 
try to avoid imbalances. 

Section 4.1.1
Decentralised commitment doesn't require parties to trade physical 
transmission contracts.  LMPs would also allow decentralised commitment.  It 
is difficult to imagine an efficient dispatch resulting from flowgate trading 
unless there are few transmission constraints and hence few flowgates.  
Simplified flowgates is the same as zonal LMPs.

Interim model (section 5)
1) It will be difficult to impose a single RTO design on the multitude of 
jurisdictions in the US - because of the private stakes in the industry.
2) The proposed day-ahead market need not be run by the ISO.  It's not a unit 
commitment since it may not result in a feasible unit commitment, and even if 
it did Parties may deviate through imbalance trading.  Rather, day-ahead 
trading could be left to the market to develop.  Generators would self commit 
based on their own forecasts of spot prices for the following day and parties 
could hedge their positions through day ahead contracts trading.  These 
day-ahead energy contract markets would be based at hubs - leaving parties 
with basis risk between the hub and their location.  Parties require some 
means of heging the basis risk - financial transmission rights is a 
possibility.

Competitive framework (section 6)
1) Demand side response reduces generators' market power.  Forward 
contracting mitigates the effect of market power on both generators and 
consumers, particularly the impact of short term market power. This may be an 
argument for using HHIs to measure market power.
2) A move towards regulatory intervention every time the supply/demand 
imbalance became tight would add to regulatory risk.  And it may deter new 
entrants if such intervention prevents prices from rising.
3) With full retail competition there is no need to regulate suppliers' 
forward contracting since suppliers can only pass on their competitive costs 
to customers.  Non-eligible customers create a problem.  What price should 
these customers pay?  It is difficult to regulate a supplier's contracts and 
to somehow split its contract costs between eligible and non-eligible 
customers.  This is why a spot price pass-through is suggested.  Financial 
institutions would be free to provide hedging contracts to consumers. Those 
institutions would in turn have financial contracts with generators.  An 
alternative is incentive regulation of suppliers of non-eligible customers.  
To avoid the california problem the regulator would need to limit the 
supplier's downside and upside risk.

Nick

Jim/Rick:

We have revised the draft paper on market objectives and attributes in
response to Jim's comments. This is attached. Much of the material is the
same but there were a few key items that needed clearing up.

The question of how short-term balancing and spot markets should be
organized is so critical (and potentially requiring a significant policy
shift) that we are writing a (much shorter) separate piece on this subject.
Should be ready late this afternoon for discussion on tomorrow's call.

riff for all RTOs to work from that did not restrict RTOs from filing diffe=
rent proposals, but would limit their ability to diverge from a single mark=
et model."

=09In addition to the standard model, there needs to be a deadline for eith=
er filing the tariff or for filing the standard tariff.  Without a "feet to=
 the fire" feature, nothing the grand stall will continue.  In arguing for =
a standard model, the PJM system could be the core of a proposal but we sho=
uld specific modifications to address our concerns.  On the transmission ri=
ghts issue, for instance, a simple "don't allocate" solution won't work.  T=
he lack of the secondary market for NY TCCs or PJM FTRs goes both to the la=
ck of information and to the way the rights are defined.  If as Harvey Reed=
 suggests, RTOs can submit alternative approaches, at least there will be p=
ressure to get moving.  I have not discussed this idea with West Power. =20

=09It then occurred to me that FERC  is unlikely to impose a standard tarif=
f without a rulemaking proceeding.  Whether they could act by fiat or not i=
s a moot point, since  I doubt that they would do so without creating a rec=
ord.  There are two possible down sides to a rule making.  (1)  The outcome=
 of a rulemaking is something of a crap shoot.  The incumbents have a prett=
y good record in the past, of coming out of rulemakings with plenty of good=
ies such as the native load exemption in Order No. 888.  There is a also a =
distinct risk that PJM's ICAP or transmission right allocation process is g=
iven blessed status, which will make revision of them later to be a huge up=
hill battle.  (2)  The other consequence of a rulemaking its effect on curr=
ent  RTO discussions.  The best outcome is that the uncertainty of the rule=
making creates an urgency  to get a proposal filed before a new FERC rule c=
uts off options from a new the standard for review.  The uncertainty prior =
to the issuance of Order No. 888 in fact had that effect in the West.  On t=
he other hand it can mean that nothing happens until the new rule is issued=
.  This also happened prior to Order No. 888, with a number of companies si=
tting on their hands, using the time delay to protect existing positions, w=
hile whipping up State regulators' fears of jurisdictional shift as necessa=
ry to boost their own position.

=09These are only own views.  I have not had a chance to speak with West Po=
wer this week, but I will approach Tim when I am in Portland again next wee=

Jim,

=09I have added my comments to your draft.  My concern with the "Adopt PJM"=
 approach is that it will become a fiat accompli with regard to congestion =
management. and the nature of future transmission rights.  Once adopted as =
the standard, nothing else will be accepted and any move to a decentralized=
 approach is highly unlikely.  Unlike the British, we have a hard time chan=
ging horses because of our multi-jurisdictional Federal system of governmen=
t.

=09The PJM's lack of a secondary FTR market is more that just an allocation=
 problem.  If that were true, they New York would have a secondary market -=
- none exists there either.  The unpredictability of prices is probably the=
 biggest problem since no one knows how to value FTRs or TCCs.  I think the=
 nature of instrument is also not particularly helpful.

=09During our discussion of Seabron Adamson's last draft, I maintained that=
 a centralized unit commitment process didn't fit the Pacific Northwest (PN=
W) with its pattern of trading to achieve coordination between hydroelectri=
c and thermoelectric generation.  You asked me to provide more detail hydro=
-thermal operation.  I am including a paper that covers the nature of PNW o=
perations and contracting with observations about the nature of unit commit=

Rick, Jim and Steve:

Please find attached a revise doutline for the policy paper on RTO
development.

A few things to note (to make sure you are truly OK with it):

- the "base model" described will basically be a "PJM Light" with
energy-only bids. This will involve a centralized unit commitment process
(based on a constrained optimization) and financial transmission rights. All
other items on the "wish list" will be treated as future potential
developments.

- there will a substantial section on market power issues and RTO
development.

- there will a section on the relationship between wholesale and retail
market development. The main idea is that a "wholesale only" market without
price signals sent to customers is not going to be viable.

- the main conclusion section will center on a "100 days" (not literally 100
days) set of policy proposals for getting workable markets established
across the country ASAP.

Comments welcome.

Seabron --

Here is a paper Brattle is putting together for Enron in Japan. ?See
Section 5 - A Japanese Pool. ?They make several good arguments as to why a
mandatory pool with financial settlements around the pool is key for
Japanese liberalization. ? Maybe steal some of their ideas for our US
policy arguments.

OK on the call.

Re: Centralized unit commitment and your concerns.

A few things to think about. Here are a few options:

1) Have the ISO do it (you can also have "bid-zero" bilaterals if you want
but the basic mechanism is the same). This effectively gives you PJM, New
York, etc.

2) You can have the traded flowgates approach, with the flowgate rights
needed to schedule. That way you get the right plants on in the right
places, in theory at least. This might be interesting as a future
development, but as we have previously agreed it is way too untested for use
now.

3) You can have the transmission rights (e.g flow rights a la Alliance) be
purely financial hedges (similar in some ways to FTRs), but you don't need
the flow right to schedule a transaction. This is the way that a bunch of
the RTOs seem to be going (e.g. Alliance). But this still leaves you needing
a way to create that feasible schedule. You can get feasibility by RT
through the LMP but my sense is that the RTO needs to make sure there is
enough capacity ready so that reliability can be protected. The problem of
the financial-only flowgate method in my book is that it doesn't meet one of
the key characteristics of a workable market - e.g. it doesn't really solve
the problem of congestion while there is time to do anything about it (e.g.
bring more plants online other than a few CTs, hydros, etc.). The RTO will
need some way to handle this problem, or else handle large volumes of MWh by
OOM calls at its discretion. I don't think we like that.

I was talking with some people about Alliance on Monday and they seem to
have sort of lost track of the ball, at least in my book. They are now
talking about an alternative method for dealing with day-ahead congestion.
This would effectively take the form of the re-dispatch type process used in
California. My view is that this sounds pretty clumsy, adds a lot of
complication, and will be great fun for the big generators in Alliance.
Under this system I want to be AEP - the 600 pound gorilla of the region.
And it is still effectvely centralized - the ISO takes in inc/dec bids and
broadcasts out prices, calculated by the OPF model. It has all of the
elements of LMP, just done more than once. If I am a big intergrated
generator/load utility with market power I can repeat the old games of
creating congestion by my scheduling in a constrained area and then getting
paid to unwind it.

So I think we have some basic questions to address next week on the call. I
just want to make sure we get an RTO model that can be made to work without
too much duct tape and bailing wire. If we want to jump off the centralized
unit commitment train we may need to go back and consider all of the
economic angles quite carefully. I am generally sympathetic to the
decentralized commitment idea but I also want to make sure we don't end up
with a muddle.

Cheers

Jim, Rick and Steve:

This is for tomorrow morning's meeting. To give us a focus for the
discussions I thought it would be best if we went through this fairly
quickly (maybe 45-50 minutes) as a presentation first.

Given the complexity of a full market design, this is obviously only an
overview. But our first priority is to present the ideas and develop the
logic behind the proposals.

See you tomorrow.

Christi,
 As I have been thinking about this problem, my opposition to a standard 
model is declining, partly out of frustration with the slow progress being 
made.  I think, however, that we ought to think about the potential 
consequences of recommending a standard model.  If we simply endorse PJM, 
then we may inadvertently get its warts as well -- no secondary transmission 
market, ICAP market, etc.  I think we are considering the same thing approach 
as was reported by Charles Yeung's in his note on Tuesday's Inter-RTO 
Coordination (Seams) Conference:

"Harvey Reed, Constellation Power, suggested that FERC impose a standard 
tariff for all RTOs to work from that did not restrict RTOs from filing 
different proposals, but would limit their ability to diverge from a single 
market model."

 In addition to the standard model, there needs to be a deadline for either 
filing the tariff or for filing the standard tariff.  Without a "feet to the 
fire" feature, nothing the grand stall will continue.  In arguing for a 
standard model, the PJM system could be the core of a proposal but we should 
specific modifications to address our concerns.  On the transmission rights 
issue, for instance, a simple "don't allocate" solution won't work.  The lack 
of the secondary market for NY TCCs or PJM FTRs goes both to the lack of 
information and to the way the rights are defined.  If as Harvey Reed 
suggests, RTOs can submit alternative approaches, at least there will be 
pressure to get moving.  I have not discussed this idea with West Power.  

 It then occurred to me that FERC  is unlikely to impose a standard tariff 
without a rulemaking proceeding.  Whether they could act by fiat or not is a 
moot point, since  I doubt that they would do so without creating a record.  
There are two possible down sides to a rule making.  (1)  The outcome of a 
rulemaking is something of a crap shoot.  The incumbents have a pretty good 
record in the past, of coming out of rulemakings with plenty of goodies such 
as the native load exemption in Order No. 888.  There is a also a distinct 
risk that PJM's ICAP or transmission right allocation process is given 
blessed status, which will make revision of them later to be a huge uphill 
battle.  (2)  The other consequence of a rulemaking its effect on current  
RTO discussions.  The best outcome is that the uncertainty of the rulemaking 
creates an urgency  to get a proposal filed before a new FERC rule cuts off 
options from a new the standard for review.  The uncertainty prior to the 
issuance of Order No. 888 in fact had that effect in the West.  On the other 
hand it can mean that nothing happens until the new rule is issued.  This 
also happened prior to Order No. 888, with a number of companies sitting on 
their hands, using the time delay to protect existing positions, while 
whipping up State regulators' fears of jurisdictional shift as necessary to 
boost their own position.

 These are only own views.  I have not had a chance to speak with West Power 
this week, but I will approach Tim when I am in Portland again next week.

Can we focus the PJM language as an interim fix toward the East (while maybe 
the threat of PJM in the West will make the West RTOs act quickly and adopt 
everything that Steve W. has been advocating).  Also, I agree with the ISO 
being required to provide much greater information on where the congestion 
occurs.  While the allocation of FTRs is a problem and the idiosyncratic 
nature is also a problem, it is because the traders do not have access to all 
the information.  They have told me that if they had access to all the 
information about congestion from the past several years, they could 
essentially build a model for anticipated congestion that could trade "above" 
the underlying FTRs as financial instruments.

Jim,

 I have added my comments to your draft.  My concern with the "Adopt PJM" 
approach is that it will become a fiat accompli with regard to congestion 
management. and the nature of future transmission rights.  Once adopted as 
the standard, nothing else will be accepted and any move to a decentralized 
approach is highly unlikely.  Unlike the British, we have a hard time 
changing horses because of our multi-jurisdictional Federal system of 
government.

 The PJM's lack of a secondary FTR market is more that just an allocation 
problem.  If that were true, they New York would have a secondary market -- 
none exists there either.  The unpredictability of prices is probably the 
biggest problem since no one knows how to value FTRs or TCCs.  I think the 
nature of instrument is also not particularly helpful.

 During our discussion of Seabron Adamson's last draft, I maintained that a 
centralized unit commitment process didn't fit the Pacific Northwest (PNW) 
with its pattern of trading to achieve coordination between hydroelectric and 
thermoelectric generation.  You asked me to provide more detail hydro-thermal 
operation.  I am including a paper that covers the nature of PNW operations 
and contracting with observations about the nature of unit commitment.  Given 
other work and travel, it has taken some time to complete the paper and its 
examples.  I hope this will help to explain why I am hesitant to endorse a 
centralize unit commitment implementation.

Rick:

Please find attached a short memo regarding last week's call with Jim and
the Enron RTO team. It also has some thoughts on what we might cover with
Steve K. at 2:00 p.m. CDT today.

Some other time I would like to have a quick chat about how we move to the
next step with the RTOs. It strikes me that there has been a real absence of
cleare-headed thinking in the stakeholder chin-wagging sessions. If FERC
will not impose a single design - on an abbreviated timeframe - is there
another way to add some economic logic into the equation?


Speak to you later...

Rick:

Regarding this call tomorrow: are you going to be on this?

I gather from Jim there is a lot of worry about saying anything about how
the unit commitment process works (if it is in a centralized fashion).
That's fine, but I just wanted to get your own views on this. I wrote this
in response to the idea that we were looking for something quick and
effective to put in ASAP. The closer the parallels to working markets (e.g.
PJM) the better. That to me means following the PJM model fairly closely,
and not diverging into other tracks on the RTO process. However, I see how
people like Sue Mara are going to be very upset about this.

We can develop some other options (and they are being proposed in many of
the RTO debates around the country), but I don't want us to end up
advocating things that either won't work, are very complicated to design and
implement (e.g. the California system, with re-dispatch iterations etc.), or
just plain don't make sense. I guess the next question is how to present
this to Steve Kean.

Anyway, as tomorrow's call seems to be controversial it might be useful to
have a chat first. I should be in the office most of the afternoon, or you
can reach me on (617) 513-5904 (cellphone).


Seabron
