I will have property taxes for Gleason tomorrow and I will be talking with 
Jody Pierce regarding the Fixed Operating #'s and cost numbers as well.  When 
I talked with Kevin Presto he thought that trying to use the 99 actual 
numbers and then escalting them was NOT a good idea, due to the fact that 
these are not "normal" operating assumptions.  Please give me a call if you 
have any questions.

Yes you have passed the test - Congratualations.  We have been working very 
hard on our sale and wanted to let you know that your guys came back with a 
very good bid.  We will inform you probably this afternoon or tomorrow that 
you will be making the short list.   We will probably have a short list of 
about 5-7 companies.   You guys are in the top three! I think you guys have a 
very good chance at getting these plants, which I think is an excellent 
opportunity.  Hope all is going well and your other talks are going in the 
right direction.  On a side note, from what I've heard from my parents in 
Boston, Kara seems to be doing pretty poorly.  She is clearly going through 
some very difficult times.  Talk to you soon.
Love,
Ben

Dad:
The industry is getting beat up a little bit, but I hope this isn't slowing 
you guys down at all.  I talked with Mike M the yesterday, he said that his 
meetings with you guys seem to go well.  I think that doing that deal would 
be quite beneficial to both companies over all strategies, regarding power, 
gas and cash flow.  Megan and I will be in NYC this weekend for a wedding.  I 
would like to talk to you pretty soon anout a couple of things.  I have 
decided to stay at Enron at least till this project is over, which will be 
early next year.  The more experience I have with another company, like Enron 
the better.  I am also going to reapply to just The Texas Business School.  
Things are going well with my communication with them this year.  I have 
already talked to one of their professors that I talked to last year and have 
gotten an e-mail from the director of the admissions program.  The both feel 
I have and are currently doing the right things to get into the school next 
year.  So things are going well so far.  I am contining with my other class 
and going to take the GMAT one more time.  
I have said a little more than I would have liked but I just wanted to give 
you the laod down of what I have been thinking.
Regards,
Ben

Jon: 
Here is the first of six e-mails regarding the inventories of the peakers.  
Regarding, the output and heat rates on the turbines, we copied for you the 
performance tests, which should have summary information on the output and 
heat rates at the end of each of the performance tests.  Please let me know 
if you do not find them.  Thanks!

More Questions:

Both Plants

1.  What are the short term NOx and CO emissions during startups, and are
there limitations during start-ups.

2.  Are industrial stormwater permits required at either site?

Caledonia

3.  In Caledonia, what is the custom fuel sampling schedule?

Brownsville

4.  What is the agency's response to the Enron letter regarding the 2nd
stormwater NOV?

5.  Has there been any further action by the agency since the 1st stormwater
NOV was never responded to?

6.  One memo stated that the stormwater is channeled to a wetland.  Was that
during construction only or is it ongoing?

7.  Were there any further problems with the B T Readymix concrete dumping
issue?

Charlie:
I got your message this morning.  Since we were so successful in selling some 
of our peaking plant last time, we have decided to some some more - so we are 
running like crazy to close these deals this year.  I want to let you know 
that I talked to both people at KinderMorgan and Cinergy about your company 
and the types of transactions that you guys are doing.  I have not had the 
chance to follow up, but plan to real soon.  I just tried to call you about 
10 minutes ago, thus the e-mail response.  I will try again in a little bit.  
Hope all is going well and I'll talk to you soon.

Dr. Harris:
 I hope you had an enjoyable summer and it did not go too quickly, as I felt 
mine did.  I wanted to let you know that I am still very much interested in 
attending the Business School.  
 I took your advice this summer and took a graduate level finance class 
(Financial Management), which I received an A.  I was very pleased with 
myself, because I had not taken this type of class in quite some time.  I 
have also decided to take another graduate level finance class 
(Macroeconomics), which I am currently taking.  
 I also sent my information regarding my learning disability into GMAC to try 
and receive a "special testing status" for the GMAT.   I am currently waiting 
to hear back from them with their decision.  When I hear back from GMAC, I am 
planning on re-taking the GMAT to try and increase my score.
 As you can see, I am still very much interested in attending the Business 
School for next year and I'm in the process of doing whatever I can to 
increase my application profile. 
 Please let me know if there is anything else you think I need to do to 
enhance my application profile.   Again, I hope all is going well and I look 
forward to hearing from you soon. 

Regards,

Ben Rogers

I work at Enron, in our corporate development group and have been through
many different analyst reports.  I went through your previous "The Power
Curve" report and enjoyed it thoroughly and recently heard that the second
version is out and wanted to get a copy.  If that's possible that would be
great.  Thanks in advance for this request.

Here is the latest "CA" with everyone's changes.  I feel that this is pretty 
close to the best we can offer in terms of the stand-still and 
non-solicitation agreements.  Enron usually does not get into stand-still 
agreements, so doing this one was a big step for Enron.  Look forward to 
talking to you tomorrow morning.  Thanks for your patience.  Again, this is a 
draft copy for discussions purposes only.

Ben

Hey, sorry its been a little while but I've been traveling and keeping some 
late hours on these generation projects.  With regards to UT, I am going to 
stay at Enron for another year.  I feel that the thing that hurt me from 
getting in the schools I wanted to get into were my undergraduate grades.  So 
I have decided to take a couple of graduate level finance courses this summer 
and re-apply next year.  Actually, I'll apply to Columbia this Sept to get 
into their January program, which goes for a year and half.  

So lets get together for lunch before you head off for B-school this summer.  
Talk to you soon.

School.  Thank you for your help and hope to hear from you soon.  Thanks!

Professor Titman:
Thank you for talking with the people in the admissions office.  I wanted to 
ask you what you think I could do at this point to help the admission's 
people understand the reason for my GMAT score.  I know that this is a poor 
reflection of what I can actually achieve and I know that I will do well and 
be successful in the learning environment at UT.  If I need to, I can provide 
the admissions office the documents stating the disability.  If you can let 
me know what you think I can do, I would appreciate it.  Thanks agin!

Saturday so when can fly in on Sat.  We ended up working around the apartment

played outdoor b-ball, it was really nice outside.  Hope we can get together 
soon b/c it was good to see you and Susan for dinner last week.  Talk to you 
this week.

Hey Dan:
Just wanted to drop you a line.  I hadn't talked to you in quite some time 
and wanted to see how everything was going.  I had lunch today with my 
friend, Andrew Slocum, who I think you know.  He talked to his good friend 
Adam Wexslur (sp) and said things were going well with the paper.  He told me 
that everything seemed to be going great and that the paper has been out on 
print for a little while now.  It sounds great!  Please let me know how 
everything is going, because I think its awesome what your doing.  Hope to 
talk to you soon.
Ben

Good to hear from you.  Yes, it was a wonderful weekend to work all weekend.  
Were very busy at work and will continue to be so through the rest of the 
year.  It is very upsetting to hear about Kara.  Seems like she has a long 
way to go to recovery, but I'm optimistic that she can get to where she needs 
to be.  I talked to her Sunday morning.  She seemed upbeat.  I hope the place 
she is staying at is giving her a glance at how bad it could be so that its 
kind of a wake up call.  Let me know how Megan and I can help.  Megan is 
going to get this really good book on Manic Depression.  Hope we can talk 
about this soon.
Love,
 Your Son

Mr.Jemison:
Thanks for the fast reply.  That time sounds great.  I have an information 
session at 1:00 pm and a meeting with someone in the Admissions office at 
3:00 pm, so that works out perfectly.  I'm really looking forward to coming 
to Austin to visit the school and to visit with you.  See you on Friday the 
18th at 2:30 pm.

1) do the capital cost of linears (gas, transmission and system upgrades)
include tax gross ups relating thereto?

2) Is the cost of backup power (for startup and station service) included in
the variable O&M estimate, or is it included in one of the fixed charges.
Please tell us where it is and how much it is expected to be annually?

Thanks.

Was that your harse realities of life speech.  I thought you were aa optimist 
just like myself.  I belive I actually should get a lot of credit and not 
just contribution for this deal.  It's not often an Associate helps crate 
$200 MM of value.  Have you checked out how much snow B.C. has gotten 
recently and how much there about to get - its incredible.  This is going to 
be a great ski season.

First of all, I am going to run the NYC Marathon and kick both of your 
asses.  Lets put a little wager on this.  I headed to the Final Four this 
weekend and for a little opening day at Cinergy Field to see Ken G. knock 
some homers.  A lot is going on with work and I'm also trying to figure out 
about grad school.  I potentially have an offer to go work at an investment 
bank in NYC (Merrill and CSFB)  Need to figure this out soon.  Those pictures 
looked great from Bahrain and those other places.  Hope all is going well and 
keep in touch.  See ya

 Just wanted to give everyone a update on where we were with all the site 
visits to the plants.  As you already know, site visits begin this Thursday 
and runs through the 27th of October, so its a pretty tight schedule.  In 
terms of who will be specifically covering which plants, this is the 
following: Gleason will be Dave Kristich; Lincoln will be Fred Mitro; and 
Wheatland will be Ross Newlin.  These guys will cover the site visits the 
next two weeks, but everyone else may be asked to fill in for them if needed.
  While on the site visit, please make sure that the companies do not take 
any pictures and they are only allowed to talk to you or the plant manager.  
Most of the companies will probably be there for only a couple of hours per 
day.
 I hope all of this is clear and if you have any questions about scheduling 
please give me a call.  Again, thank you for your help with these issues.
Regards,

Ben

If you can let me know when you have talked with Dave, that would be great.  
I am trying to talk with Don Miller and wanted to make sure that you had 
already talked with Dave.  Enron's PRC is going on and I am trying to get 
promoted to manager and this deal should enable me to do just that.  Thanks

Ashley:
Thanks for sending this e-mail so quickly.  I would like to suggest a couple 
of changes to your resume just to "tighten" it up a little bit.  These are 
just minor changes that will make it look more consistent.  I also talked to 
a women who sits two seats down from me, who is a recruiter for another 
group.  She wanted to take a look at your resume once it was ready.  Let's 
try and talk about this later today or this weekend, so you can make these 
changes. Once we get things going internally, I know we can get you over here 
at Enron pretty quickly.  If I don't hear from you later today, please try me 
at home which is (713) 355-8738.  Talk to you soon.

Just wanted to let you know how everything went with the Marathon if you 
haven't heard already.  My time was a little slower (4:27: 53), but I 
finished and my goal of not walking was kept.  I now want you to focus in on 
is the MS150 in April.  We are both doing it and yes, I will give you your 
bike back to do it.  I think this would be something really fun to train for 
and to participate in.  Talk to you soon.

I talked with the legal guys at Cinergy and after further discussions with 
Mike Cyrus, they felt that since these discussions were at a high level and 
very early in discussions that a "CA" at this time was not needed.  There 
were two sticking points that I was trying to get them to backdown from: 1) a 
stand-still agreement and 2) a solicitation agreement.  They were not willing 
to back down from these, thus they concluded with suggesting no "CA".  Let me 
know if this is your thoughts as well.  Thanks!

My shares are just as worthless as the next guys...After announcing 27% 
increase in earnings, but on the same day overshadowed by the REI deal, they 
are certainly needing some deals to do.  My advice...execution, execution, 
execution, of DEALS. that is.

Jinsung and Don,

We are continuing to have difficulties accessing data from DealBench.  The
response times from PECO, PricewaterhouseCoopers and other high speed
internet connections have been very slow (sometimes 5 minutes or more to
retrieve a single 10-15 page text document).  It would help us greatly in
our due diligence efforts if this material could be made available on CD
ROM as has often been done with other deals we have been involved with.
Please advise if this is possible and if so, when the CD's would be
available.

The following is an update on Enron's sales process, including several
additions to DealBench.

1.  The Purchase and Sale Agreement ("PSA") for each asset has now been
posted to DealBench under the New Document section.  Please review the
instructions attached to each PSA.

2. The Management Presentations (with audio) have now been posted to
DealBench under the Management Presentation(strikethrough: s) section.
When attempting to view the presentation, please log onto DealBench using
Microsoft Internet Explorer. Once in DealBench, you will most likely need
to download "Flash Player" (free download).  You can do this by clicking
"Macromedia Flash Player download center" in the Linked Documents section
of DealBench.  The download usually takes less than 30 seconds.  After the
download, return to the Management Presentation section of DealBench and
click on the Management Presentation (with audio).   A power point
presentation has also been included in the Management Presentation section
of DealBench.   A detailed instruction guide "Instruction for Viewing
Management Presentation" has been posted in New Document section of
DealBench.

3.  Please be sure to consistently review the New Documents section on
DealBench for any new documents that have been added to DealBench.  Also, a
running black line Due Diligence Index is posted in the Due Diligence Index
/ Plant Pictures section of DealBench.

4. Any drawings or CDs that you need from the Due Diligence Indices may be
requested by sending an email to don.miller@enron.com or jhoff2@enron.com.

5.  Any problems or issues that you may be encountering need to  be
directed to Jinsung Myung at 713-853-7330.

6.  We are prepared to schedule Q&A sessions.  Please contact Don Miller at
713-853-0492.

Regards,

Don Miller

I came in this weekend to go through the model that I thought you were going 
to send me on Friday.  Can you send that over so I can get up to speed with 
it.  I am just trying to learn how you have been valuing these assets.  Thanks

Thanks for the quick reply.  I live within inside the loop on Buffalo 
Speedway near 59.  I think lunch next week sometime would be great.  I can 
come up to the Woodlands and we can meet up for lunch.  Let me check to see 
what day is best and I will send you an e-mail later today to confirm.  Hope 
that works and I'll talk to you soon.

I just wanted to touch base with you and let you know I am still with Enron 
and still enjoying the experience and currently working on selling some of 
our power plants with the Generation Investments Group.  I also wanted to say 
congratulations on the birth of your twins - thats great!  If there is any 
chance to have lunch I would greatly look forward to having lunch with you.  
By the way, I had a really good conversation with Rocky Storie the other 
day.  He was my representative for my performance review and I felt he did a 
great job and I greatly appreciated it.  Hope all is going well and I look 
forward to talking to you soon.

Hey Warren:
Here are a couple of questions we are working on for Duke on the 99's.  If

Subject:  Property tax - Caledonia

Doc 01.07.02  - Talks about a 15% assessment for as valorem taxes.
Doc 01.07.02.01 - Property tax estimates - estimates from 2001-2019  (tax +
pilot payments) are $1M a year till 2009 and then to ~$1.4 M for next few
years beg 2010, dropping back down to $700K level.

In 2000, the property tax was just $500K, as there seems to be no pilot
payment until Jan 2001.

My questions are -
   Confirm that the 15% assessment in first doc is included in the estimate
   The schdule of estimated payments is all inclusive of the payments
   relating to property taxes
   Refer me to doc that talks about the pilot agreement or any other tax
   abatement docs

Thanks.

Swati

It was good to see a fellow Yankee down in these here parts.  I got some 
really good feedback from all the people I talked with.  I think that UT 
would be a good fit for what I'm trying to do afterwards - with there 
energy-finance concentration and investment fund.  Plus it would be fun 
living in Austin for a couple of years.  When your in Houston next time wh 
can grab some drinks and go to dinner.  Talk to you soon.

Subject: PG&E Questions


PG&E Gen is most interested in Pastoria and had several questions/concerns
that they asked about during my discussion with them:

* What is Enron's intent re: continuing involvement?  PG&E is
concerned about any potential requirements that they might be required to
either purchase fuel from Enron or engage Enron as the power marketer.
* What is status of EPC negotiations.  Will they be required to engage
NEPCO as the EPC contractor?  Does the EPC contractor have control over the
turbines?
* They also questioned whether there would be any "agricultural
restrictions"?

Bruce did give us project cost numbers and I will have him e-mail them to 
you.  Also, you and I already went through the project eval. form on USEC.  
Tom and I were trying to get numbers by Wednesday, but give me a call once 
you get the project cost numbers.  Thanks for your help with this project.

Please send me an excel spreadsheet which depicts the value that you see 
associated with the heat rate spread option.  I want to make sure that I 
understand exactly how you propose valuing the transaction and how this value 
would be booked.  As such, please provide the following detail:

Will we be valuing/booking a series of monthly call options or a series of 
daily call options?
What power curve are we valuing the deal against - PJM East or West Hub?
Please send me the current fuel curve that you are converting to $/MWh to 
value the deal?
What volatilities are you using to value the options - monthly volatilities 
or intra-day volatilities or a blend of the two (if blending please show me 
what formula you using to blend the two vols)?
What expiration date are you using, i.e.: for monthly call options the 15th 
of the relevant month, and for daily options?
What correlation are you assuming, 15% flat for twenty years?
Are you deducting all operating expenses from the value of the option?
Are you using the "SPRDOPT" Exotic Options function to value the option?
Are you using the $/MWh VOM dollar amount as your strike?
Has Don provided the fixed payment stream?  This stream should be covering 
both P&I and not just principal.

Yvan, and Ben, please provide answers to these question via written 
correspondence so that their is limited probability of misunderstanding.  
Thank you both very much for your time and help thus far.  Furthermore, I 
would like to reiterate that RAC's goal, prior to quoting any credit reserve, 
is to be 100% confident that: (i) the methodology that is being employed is 
consistent among the internal groups; and (ii) the inherent value of the 
price risk management contracts matches.  This enables RAC to manage the 
associated risk during the life of the transaction both effectively and 
appropriately.

Regards,

Christopher

Just wanted to remind you about the call I received from Paul Cavicchi with 
Tractebel.  He was calling to ask about an extention to the bidding on the 
assets.  I basically said that there are no extentions except for bids that 
are strong bids that come in on Monday or Tuesday of next week.  He sounded a 
little disappointed that they got the book so late, but still seemed 
interested in the assets.  Hope this helps.

Basically, having chillers in the project (running at full load) will 
increase the Heat Rate by approximately 50 degrees (ie. if HR is 10,465 w/o 
chillers to 10,409 w chillers).  Let me know if you have any questions.

My thoughts on the Central Iowa Power Cooperative RFP

Let me know what you think

1.  We will develop two GE 7 EA's.  Unit 1 operational 5/1/01.  Unit 2 
operational 5/1/02

2.  We will use the Ogden/Boone County Site being secured by John Moore.  The 
site is 1/4 mile from Northern Natural Gas Mainline.  Also, Ameren 345 Kv and 
Alliant 115Kv line onsite.  Assume interconnects to both of these systems.  
Please break out cost for each.

3.  Assume no fuel oil back-up

4.  Assume no black start

5.  Design the units to be later converted to combined cycle.

6.  Assume water injection for nox control.

7.  Assume portable de-min water facilities

8.  Assume Enron does EPC

9.  Assume CIPCO will finance and own the plant  through ther term of the PSA 
and thereafter

10.  Assume CIPCO will execute a power sales agreement (PSA) with Enron from 
5/1/01 through 10/31/07

Duke is presenting their final bid this Sunday, so I think its even more 
important to get the PSA signed by tomorrow, so that there is no chance to 
try and retrade the deal.  I don't know how things ended up yesterday, but I 
think things need to come together very fast.

Just wanted to let you know that I received an e-mail from Dr. Carl Harris, 
who at this point is in charge of my application.  He wants me to answer a 
few questions, making sure I will be able to handle the MBA coursework.  That 
was one of my main reasons for meeting with you and the Professors' Ronn and 
Brown, is to talk to you about the course work and inform you of my strengths 
and weaknesses, to make sure I could do the work.  I know that with my 
financial modeling and accounting skills, energy-finance background and the 
Business School's team-oriented approach to learning, that I will excel in 
this learning environment.  I will convey this message and others to him by 
tomorrow.  I hope things workout and thanks again for your help.

Subject: Lincoln, Nebraska Preliminary O&M Estimate

Ben, please find attached the preliminary O&M estimate for the Lincoln, NE 
project that we discussed. It shows O&M cost estimates for a 20 year period 
assuming a stand alone plant with Availability required Monday - Friday, 6 am 
to 10 pm during the peak seasons (hence 2 operating shifts of staff). The GT 
major maintenance accrual is also shown assuming no membership in the Lease 
Engine Membership program. Since we will be buying the output of the plant 
from the Owner & Operator (LES) during a contract period, we may consider not 
showing them these numbers. Before tipping our hand, I'd like to see what 
they plan to "charge" us for the O&M portion of the power they provide us 
during the agreement period. Please review these and the other assumptions to 
ensure that I understand the project correctly at this point (especially the 
water treatment part). 


Since its preliminary in nature, please consider its accuracy +/- 25% for our 
proforma purposes.

If LES is to provide what they feel the O&M would be, please let me in on 
their numbers so we can provide our experience.

Michael:
How's your summer?  Are you in Delaware now?  I am going to set up a weekend 
in DC in the Fall and I will probably do it around homecoming weekend.  I 
want to try and set it up for most of the people will huge out with, but will 
take other suggestions.  I will be sending out e-mails to everyone informing 
them of the weekend.  Choby is going to set up a bar to rent out for Saturday 
night.  In the past, you have sent me e-mails with a bunch of different 
e-mail addresses attached to it.  If you could send me a list of the e-mails 
you have for our friends that would be great.  Thanks for the help and lets 
talk about this further.  Talk to you soon.

Thanks for the reply!  I will be driving to Austin Friday morning and 9:00 am 
looks like a good time to meet.  My afternoon (1:00-5:00) is full with a 
information session, meeting with other Professors (Titman, Ronn and Jemison) 
and an Admissions interview.  I would appreciate it if you could send me your 
office location, so I can meet you at 9:00am on Friday.  Thanks again for 
taking the time to meet with me.  Look forward to meeting you.

Yes still in Texas, but thinking about moving back up East to New York.  I 
have applied to B-School so I'm waiting to here from them.  What a process 
this has been!  I have talked to Mike G. a couple times lately and we were 
thinking about trying to get alot of people together probably in the spring 
sometime.  We'll see how that goes.  Hope all is going well and next time 
lets keep in touch sooner.  See ya

Mike:
Just a thought regarding Kinder/Morgan.  These guys mainly care about the gas 
pipelines and that some of there projects are actually put on there lines to 
increase throughput.  These plants that they want on their lines are 
currently in construction or development.  Their only operational plants are 
in Colorado.  They have a good generation team, but I fell that they do not 
want to be in the business of operating and maintaining the plants, just as 
long as somebody wants to put them along their lines.  If you guys offered to 
buy their plants and projects, they would mainly care about price (cash and 
stock in the new company) and to put contracts in place for some of their 
projects to put on their lines.  Hope this helps.

Question 1

Case 1 at 20F and 60% RH CTG would have net unit output of 46,726 kW at a 
heat rate of 10,183 Btu/kWhr HHV new & clean
Case 2 at 90F and 54% RH CTG would have net unit output of 43,220 kW at a 
heat rate of 10,804 Btu/kWhr HHV new & clean

Case 1 has gas compression, no chilling/heating, Case 2 has gas compression 
and chilling. Both cases include simple cycle CTG aux and expected steup 
transformer losses. Back pressure is based on 14" HRSG.

Question 2

For case 2, Sprint water injection is 1915 lb/hr +/1 20%, we are also water 
injecting for NOx control 21,981 lb/hr so total is 23,896 lb/hr. Currently 
cannot Sprint with DLE combustor.

Ben,

On the Wisconsin Public Service deal (WPS) please consider the following:

1.  One LM-6000 to be sited near Green Bay Wisconsin
2.  Will be configured in combined cycle mode with a HRSG
3.  100% of the output will go to an industrial customer of WPS


Key Questions

1.  What is the heat rate and Mw rating of our turbine at site conditions (20 
degrees winter and 90 degrees summer)

2.  What is the water consumption with Sprint verses water injection

3.  What is a 10 year fixed gas price at chicago starting 6/1/01 on a 
baseload volume of 10,000 mmbtu/d

Subject: PG&E Questions

David Parquet asked me to forward these answers to you:
Question:
Is the major maintenance reserve estimate based on a negotiated Long Term
Services Agreement (LTSA)?  If so, will it be in place and transfer with
PEF?
Answer:  We have not negotiated an LTSA with anyone at this time, and we do 
not expect to have one in place to transfer with PEF.  The maintenance 
reserve is our estimate based on industry data and information from GE.

Question: Are spare parts for the first major overhaul included anywhere in 
the
capital cost estimate or are they assumed to be purchased through the
maintenance reserve estimate (i.e. the LTSA) charge?

Answer:  The maintenance reserve is intended to include parts and labor for 
the overhaul.

Gentlemen,

Attached is a list of due diligence questions for the Enron generation
assets (Wheatland, Lincoln, Gleason and LV Cogen).  We would very much
appreciate your help is getting answers for by Friday, 10/20 if possible.

Unfortunately, we are still having significant difficulty in accessing
documents on DealBench.  The download time is usually several minutes to a
half hour per document and often the larger documents will not fully print
out on our systems.  Two of our consultants have experienced similar
difficulties which suggests that whatever problems we are facing are not
unique to systems at PECO.

We are concerned that the limited information will impact our ability to
bid on the assets.  Would it be possible to receive from you either a print
out of the documents or the documents on CD ROM?

Mike Cazaubon

As if you guys needed any tips...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.  I wish you were a door so I could bang you all day long.

2.  (Lick finger and wipe on her shirt)  Let's get  you out of these wet
clothes.

3.  Nice legs...what time do they open?

4.  Do you work for UPS? I could have sworn I saw you checking out my
     package.

5.  You've got 206 bones in your body, want one more?

6.  Can I buy you a drink or do you just want the money?

7.  I may not be the best looking guy in here, but I'm the only one
    talking to you.

8.  I'm a bird watcher and I'm looking for a Big Breasted Bed
    Thrasher, have you seen one?

9.  I'm fighting the urge to make you the happiest woman on earth
     tonight.

10.  Wanna play army? I'll lay down and you can blow the hell outta
       me.

11.  I wish you were a Pony Carousel outside Walmart, so could ride
      you all day long for a quarter.

12.  Oh, I'm sorry, I thought that was a braille name tag.

13.  I'd really like to see how you look when I'm naked

14.  Is that a ladder in your stockings or the stairway the heaven?

15.  You might not be the best looking girl here, but beauty is only
       a light switch away

16.  Are those real?

17.  You must be the limp doctor because I've got a stiffy.

18.  You can feel the magic between us...No, lower!

19.  I'd walk a million miles for one of your smiles, and even
       farther for that thing you do with your tongue.

20.  Girl, if you were a porch I'd take out all the nails and screw
       ya
21.  If it's true that we are what we eat, then I could be you by
      morning.
22.  (Look down at the crotch)  It's not just going to suck tself.

23.  You know, if I were you, I'd have sex with me.

It would be a trading/marketing power position.  My goal is to understand

Professor Titman:
 I would like to thank you for taking the time to recommend me to the MBA 
Program.  In the end, the results were not favorable.  I understand that it 
is a competitive process, but I felt that with my work experiences, 
recommendations, extrcurricular activities, etc., that this would help my 
chances and possibly compensate my disability.  After talking with you and 
Professors Ronn, Brown and Jemison, I was sure that UT was the right place to 
continue learning about energy-finance.  
  I am still sure that UT is the place for getting an excellent 
graduate-level education, so I want you to know that I am going to do what 
ever it takes to get in next year.  I plan on taking a couple of graduate 
level finance courses at the University of Houston this Summer and Fall to 
demonstrate to the Admissions office that I can compete at this level. I also 
plan on trying to retake the GMAT test.  Due to my disability, this will be a 
monumental task, but I am determined to prove to the Admissions committment 
that I can do the work at The Texas University Graduate School of Business.
 Also, I would like to continue our dialague regarding creating an 
Energy-Finance Private Equity Fund at UT.  I know that with my industry-wide 
and investment banking contacts that I can help raise capital for the fund.  
I am very interested in energy-finance and think that your idea is a very 
good.  
 Thanks again for taking the time to listen and talk with me.  It has been a 
pleasure to meet with you and I hope we can continue to talk about energy and 
finance in the future.  Also, if you think of anything else I can do to 
strengthen my overall application file for next year, please let me know.  
Take care and hope to hear from you soon.

Sincerely,

Ben Rogers

haven't even been able to do that.  We were here last night till 10:00 and it 
looks to be the same tonight and potentially for the rest of the year.  This

Meg:
I would like to make sure that I have fully explained the reason for my GMAT 
score.  If the admissions office needs me to provide documentation on this 
disability I can do that.  Due to this disability, the GMAT score is not a 
good indicator of how I will do at UT.  Through what I have learned in my 
work experiences with State Street Bank and Enron, I know that I will be able 
to successfully do the work that UT requires.  If you could let me know what 
I can do to further explain my GMAT score I would greatly appreciate it.  If 
you think it would be better to talk to Dr. Harris-I will do that.  Thanks 
again for taking the time to help me with this issue.

Subject: PG&E Questions


PG&E Gen is most interested in Pastoria and had several questions/concerns
that they asked about during my discussion with them:

* What is Enron's intent re: continuing involvement?  PG&E is
concerned about any potential requirements that they might be required to
either purchase fuel from Enron or engage Enron as the power marketer.
* What is status of EPC negotiations.  Will they be required to engage
NEPCO as the EPC contractor?  Does the EPC contractor have control over the
turbines?
* They also questioned whether there would be any "agricultural
restrictions"?

Here are the two CA's we are currently working off of.  The first one is 
Enron's latest draft and the second one is Cinergy's latest draft.  Enron 
usually does not get into stand-still agreements, but we decided to in this 
case.  We have been exchanging comments for two weeks and now we need to sit 
down and discuss these points from a commercial stand-point to get over these 
differences.  Please give me a call when you get this so we can go through 
these issues.  Thanks for your time with this issue.

It wasn't like I was neglecting you.  You must understand that e-mail is 
faster than sending a letter and its slower than calling someone, but there 
is not always an immediate return.  Some people are lazy with returning 
e-mail.  It has been really busy here.  We are working long hours and this 
project is trying to close by the end of the year.  It's a $1 Billion 
project, so it takes alot of work.  Talk to you soon.

Here is the latest Kinder-Morgan update from Scott.  As you know, these guys 
have alot of generation and are under pressure to get several projects done 
soon.  I also think that your price risk management structure would be a good 
product for them.

I spoke to Jay Hopper again at KN.  Here are the results of my conversation:

1.  Entergy Project--I told Jay that our immediate interest would be to 
purchase the Jackson project with the outside tolling bid in place.  Given 
their immediate focus is to finalize the tolling agreement for the project, 
he suggested that we revisit this topic in 3 months.  He sounded a bit 
nervous.  Perhaps there is an opportunity to swoop in later.

2.  ECAR Projects--Because these projects are 4th and 5th in their cue, he 
would like to discuss our involvement at a later date.

3.  7FA versus 7EA turbines--It turbines out that KN's Illinois turbines are 
7EAs (six of them).  I told him that we would still be interested in making a 
joint venture proposal for the turbines to them.  He is going to have Chuck 
Walker from his Chicago office call me.

Hey Jon;
Just e-mailing to see how everyone is doing.  Megan and I are going over to 
Austin to a resort to celebrate our 1st anniversary - I can't believe it.  
I've been trying to work on the golf game, but I'm taking a couple of 
graduate business courses at night so that keeps me pretty busy on the 
weekends as well.  Hope all is well and I'll talk to you soon.
Go Sox!

I talked with Thomas Suffield and he wants Miguel Vasquez to run the numbers 
on the Florida model., since they have been running numbers on the Plano 
model for a little while now.  I walked Miguel through what I had done and 
how they should look at running the model, based on what Thomas found out and 
what you have said in the past.  I also gave them the numbers that the desk 
has given based on the simple cycle case (5 year number) and combine-cycle 
case (5 year number).  From this they have modeled and graphed these 
different scenarios.  I also worked on getting a bid and ask from the desk, 
but you may need to talk to Berney because they are not giving out the ask at 
this time.  
Hope this helps and please give me a call if you have any questions. Thanks

Hey Mike,
Thanks for the pics.  Where were the ones from which  looks to be a wedding?  
Hey, how many tickets were you thinking about? Were you thinking two for you 
and your Dad?  That weekend is April 1 & 3, 2000.  I'm not sure whether that 
is Easter weekend or not.  One other way to get tics is to go to 
www.finalfourseats.com  Let me know your situation.  Where are you spending 
the New Year?  Talk to you later.

Subject: Additional PG&E Question and an Aquila Question - all on Pastoria


I spoke to Aquila again today.  They are planning to submit bids on Friday
for Gleason, Wheatland and Pastoria.  They already have a tolling agreement
in the Lincoln area and don't want more capacity there.

Aquila's question:

They questioned the development costs for Pastoria - look very high.  I
noted that it includes the ERC's.  They would like a breakout of the
development costs


PG&E's question is below.  Are you comfortable disclosing this at this stage
or is this a phase II due diligence item?

Since we do not have to accept the NEPCO contract, can you break out the
cost and scope of equipment (Enron uses the term "power islands")?  Can we
get this information tomorrow?  Both cost and scope of this is important to
be able to assess the "EPC" price and determine bid price.

John:
With regards to the Demin water system, there are no capitalized charges in 
these cost figures - everything is expensed.  With respects to the 
Electricity, there is a Demand Charge included in this numer, which makes up 
approximately 50% of the cost.  The rest is attributable to energy costs.  
These costs are levelized for the full 12 months of the year.  Please let me 
know if you have any other comments.  Thanks!

We and my family are going to Beaver Creek for x-mas but are going on a 
cruise which travels to different Virgin islands and will be in St. Barts for 
New Years.  We have never been to these Islands or on a cruise before so it 
should be pretty interesting.  I'll let you know about the tics.  See ya

Do you have time to meet with Tom Swank and me on another project, which 
includes four LM 6000's.  I have begun the modeling, thus we wanted to run 
through with you the configuration of this facility, since its going to be a 
"brownfield".  Talk to you soon.  Thanks

I received a call from Tom Favinger at PG&E today.  He is looking for the
responses to his questions from last week and also has a new question.  He
would like to get a breakout of the $10.25 million item in the Pastoria
capital budget labeled Pre-Commercial Operations Costs.

I also spoke to Darryn O Llegas from PECO today.  They are planning to bid
on the peakers and LV Cogen on Friday.  His questions are:

Peakers

* Will Enron's control area dispatching/scheduling software be
included in the property conveyed with the peakers?
* Do the Peaker's permits make any allowance for combined cycle
operation or would they need to re-start the permitting process?
* They would like clarification concerning the joint ownership of gas
interconnects - what is owned, cost to maintain, etc.

LV Cogen

* Update on status of Phase II permitting?
* Update on status of development process?
* Are there any tax abatements of any type for the Phase II project?

Additional Comments from PECO:

* Don't have price curves yet for all of the peakers markets - will
need to develop prior to final bid.
* May have a concern re: market power for the peakers as a result of
the PECO/Unicom merger.  They will be comfortable enough to bid this week
and don't expect it to be a concern for the final bid.
* They will probably submit a bid with separate values for: Wheatland;
other peakers together; LV Cogen.
* They are working their bid from two perspectives: replacement cost
plus a premium and discounted cash flow.  DCF will obviously change as they
get their price curves updated.

Sorry to hear that.  I called Patty again to ask her brother if he knew 
anybody running the marathon.  I also called Megan's sister, Deirdre to see 
if she knows of anyone not going to run, but signed up.  I hope this helps.  
It would great for you to be in it, running it.

Dr. Harris:
 I would like to thank you for personally taking the time to closely review 
my application. Though I am disappointed with the results I am still 
determined to attend The TEXAS Graduate School of Business next year.  I 
understand how competitive the process has become, but I felt that with my 
work experiences, recommendations, personality, extracurricular activities, 
etc. that this would compensate for my disability.  After talking with 
Professors Titman, Ronn, Brown and Jemison, I was sure that the School was 
the right place to get the education I was looking for.  
  I am still certain that the School is the best place for getting a great 
graduate-level education, so I want you to know that I am going to do 
whatever it takes to get in next year.  I plan on taking two or three 
graduate level finance courses at the University of Houston this Summer and 
Fall to demonstrate to the Admissions committee that I can compete at the 
graduate level. I also plan on retaking the GMAT test.  Due to my disability, 
this will be a monumental task; but I am determined to prove to the Committee 
that I can be successful at The TEXAS Graduate School of Business.  I would 
like to come down to Austin this spring to meet with you to further discuss 
my application file and to personally meet you.   
  If you think of anything else I can do to strengthen my overall application 
file for next year, please let me know.  Take care and hope to hear from you 
soon.

Sincerely,

Ben Rogers

My Dad has the tickets and is going to keep them with him.  He doesn't want 
them to get lost in the mail.  We are staying in Cincinatti and are driving 
over Sat and Monday for the games.  The best thing to do is meet at a certain 
gate # or the "will call window".  I will call your Dad next week and set 
things up on a meeting place before the game.  Leave me your Dad's home 
number so I can call him next week.  These guys are going to have a great 
time that weekend.  Talk to you soon.

Miller/HOU/ECT@ECT 
Subject: PG&E Questions


My responses to one set of PG&E questions would be as follows.  Dean is 
answering the other one and will send back to you directly.

* What is Enron's intent re: continuing involvement?  PG&E is
concerned about any potential requirements that they might be required to
either purchase fuel from Enron or engage Enron as the power marketer.

RESPONSE: Enron is very flexible re continuing involvement:  scheduling 
coordination, fuel supply, power marketing, etc.  We are also flexible re the 
time period and the terms of the continuing involvement.  Whatever 
arrangement is developed would be mutually beneficial.



* What is status of EPC negotiations.  Will they be required to engage
NEPCO as the EPC contractor?  Does the EPC contractor have control over the
turbines?

RESPONSE: o EPC negotiations are complete with NEPCO.  Contract has not been 
executed, but has been "put on the shelf" awaiting decision on successful 
bidder for the purchase of the Pastoria project from ENA.  Successful bidder 
and NEPCO will each have the option of executing the EPC agreement.

  o Successful bidder is under no obligation to engage NEPCO.

  o West LB has control of the turbines.  They can be assigned either to the 
LLC or to ENA.  (If assigned to ENA, it was because the successful bidder for 
the Pastoria project did not want the turbines with the acquisition.)  If 
assigned to the LLC as part of the acquisition, the LLC can then assign the 
turbines to the ultimate EPC contractor.   



* They also questioned whether there would be any "agricultural
restrictions"?

RESPONSE: The project site is presently under a Williamson Act contract to 
maintain agricultural use in exchange for lower taxes.  Last week, the Kern 
County Board of Supervisors voted to cancel the Williamson Act contract to 
allow for industrial use, which started a 180 day public comment period.  
However, the Governor has on his desk a bill for signature that would reduce 
the public comment period for the cancellation to the same time frame as the 
request for rehearing period for the CEC Final Decision.  (The Governor has 
until 9/30 sign the bill and is expected to do so because of the overwhelming 
support of the bill in the Assembly and the Senate.)  The cancellation will 
be contingent upon a successful CEC decision and a payment of a Williamson 
Act cancellation fee.

Attached is an Excel Spreadsheet, worksheet 1 is a list the documents I think 
maybe available in whole or part now - we should make a request at our 
earliest convenience to Delmarva/TECO/???? I would be glad to call (probably 
following an introduction call) to get this going.

Worksheet 2 is a start of the Table of Contents of the Due Diligence - I will 
try and finish it today - we are modeling this on some Stone & Webster 
efforts we have copies of - I can get you an example as a go-by.

I have also started on the tasking letter, deliverable list, schedule, 
resources and estimated cost.  I should have that available either tomorrow 
or Monday (I won't have complete buyin on the numbers but should be close 
enough to get going).

If you have a list of our team on this project, it would be helpful. Sounded 
like Lou had a fairly complete list of the Clients people.

Just wanted to let you know that I just talked to Don Miller, the lead guy 
from our side, regarding a different matter, but he mentioned to me that 
things seemed to be not going so well in the PSA discussions.  I didn't have 
time to see what the issues were, but I will when he calls back.  As you 
already know, these assets are yours to lose and I would hate to see you guys 
lose these assets to legal issues.  I know we both can come to some middle 
ground before people lose their patience.  My only advice, for what its 
worth, is to keep talking with Delainey and to make sure the lawyers don't 
run away with the issues and forget whats at stake on the commercial side.  
Hope this helps.

Subject: Questions regarding PSD permit for Lincoln


Don,

As a result of our review of the information and documents on Lincoln we
are requesting additional documents which are not in the data room.

1.   Relating to the plant's PSD:

     The Mostardi & Platt emissions test protocol for the May 2000
     emissions test
      A report to Illlinois EPA containing the emission test data
     Continuous Emission Monitoring (" CEM") Data ( all data
     developed since start-up)
     Any reports to IEPA required under the permit pertaining to
     exceedances, or
     start-up, breakdown & malfunction ( we have internal memos indicating
     that there
     was a breakdown at # 7 on July 5,2000)

2. Also, we don't have any permits for wastewater discharge. We have been
told that there is no wastewater discharged except
sewage/office wastewater which is going to a septic field. But we have no
verification of this at this point.

Thank you for your attention to these items.

Mario H. Hurtado
Duke Energy North America

Back when, Susan transfered all the files to me and we went through the 
entire reg.risk process.  For the year I was in ISG, I never had to adjust 
the reg.risk book.  I did not hand over the files to anyone else because the 
group was breaking up and figured it was better that I keep them. I was in 
yesterday going through all my files and the boxes under my desk and did not 
come up  with them.  In rotating down to East Orig. I lost a box of stuff, 
but I didn't think it had those files in it, but it looks like that was the 
case.  Let me know what you want me to do, if anything at this point.  Again, 
sorry for the delay.

I did have a good interview at Duke Business School last week.  I should be

Charlie:
 It was a pleasure meeting you yesterday afternoon at the Columbia Business 
School information session.  As you probably noticed through my enthusiasm, I 
really enjoy working in the energy-finance industry, especially with Enron.  
Working in this sector, at this time, has created many new opportunities.  I 
am interested in talking with you to see if we can do some type of 
transaction with you guys.  It sounds like you have a lot going in areas that 
we might be interested in.  If you could send me a business proposal or 
summary of what your doing, that would be helpful.  
 With regards to Columbia Business School, I applied last year and did not 
get in due to my GMAT score.  I decided to take a graduate level finance 
class this summer, which I received an A.  I am currently taking another 
graduate finance class this semester.  I am also retaking the GMAT, with the 
hopes of increasing my quantitative score.  
 Last year, I was asked back for an interview, which I felt was a good sign.  
I heard from one of my recommenders that the only thing that I needed to 
improve on was my GMAT score.  Recently, I wrote a brief letter to the Dean 
of Admissions, Linda Meehan, informing her of my recent actions as well as my 
continued interest with Columbia.  I hope that these actions will help me get 
into Columbia this year.  My desire to go to Columbia, stems from their 
network, location, reputation and curriculum.  Since growing up in Pelham,  
it would be nice to get back to New York for a little while.
 As you can see, my desire to go to Columbia is very strong.  I hope this 
brief e-mail has provided some insight into what I'm doing to get into 
Columbia.  I hope we can meet for lunch sometime soon either up in the 
Woodlands or downtown.  Again, thank you for your interest and I look forward 
to talking with you about Columbia and future energy transactions.
Regards,

Ben Rogers

I talked with Theresa Voss about the insurance on the peakers and she said 
that they have been making payments on the peakers and that this "billing 
separately plan" on the peakers will last until March of 2001.  At that 
point, an umbrella plan will cover the turbines.  Regarding the balance 
sheet, they have been accounting for it under prepaid insurance and have been 
amortizing it each month as its been paid.  

Let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks for the fast reply.  I changed it online, but I wanted to make sure I 
wasn't booked for two different times.  Also, are you able to tell me who I 
will be meeting with?  I am meeting with a couple professors before my 
Admissions Visit and just wanted to know who I was going to meet with from 
your office.  Thanks!

There is an amendment to the TVA Interconnection Agreement in the due

Randy:
I have a couple of items I am working and wanted to know from you.
1.  How will the annoucement of the 55 MW plant in R.I. and the potential 
stake in the 1,650 MW plant in Texas effect the current asset portfolio?
2.  I am working on a spreadsheet identifying all the current and the coming 
on-line merchant MW's in detail.  Can you provide me a detail list of which 
plant assets are merchant or are going to be merchant.  
Thanks,
Ben Rogers

 I was talking with my brother-in-law who is Kinder/Morgan's VP of Corp 
Development and they would be interested in talking with us about 
contributing their 5,000 MW's of generation into a JV/Partnership to lead 
into a public offering.  We are still under several different CA's with them, 
due to our past conversation's regarding generation.  
 With our previous discussions, Rich Kinder had suggested to Kevin Hannon if 
Enron would be interested in buying the whole Orion  Project, but at that 
time ENA was only interested in the first couple of projects, due to the 
delivery of the turbines.  
 In light of our past discussions and KMI's desire to exit the generation 
business, this JV would give them the perfect "exit strategy".  Also, it 
would give us a better growth strategy, with respects to our talks with other 
parties.  I know that bringing in a potential third party would complicate 
the deal structure, but I think that it would build a much better growth 
story to Wall Street.
 If you think this would be a good idea, I can begin to set up a meeting as 
soon as possible with Kinder/Morgan.  Thanks!  
Ben

I wanted to reply, even though I have called recently.  Work has slowed down 
a little bit, but will probably pick up in a week or two.  I have traded 
calls with Kara the past two days, so I haven't talked to her in some time.  
Anyway, I hope your figuring out where we should go for a trip this sping.  
We will have to know whether Megan and I need to work on our golf games or 
not.  We have been thinking maybe you guys are thinking about going to 
Ireland or England to play some of the old courses of this world.  Or maybe 
you have been thinking about going to Paris to visit the city of love.   
Anyway, these are just some of the thinks we have been thinking about.  Talk 
to you soon.
Love 
Ben

Enron news release

FYI

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
-----------------------

Today Enron and Hades announced a definitive energy services agreement
said to be worth an estimated $666 Trillion.  In the deal, Enron will
provide
both gas and electric commodities to Hades' facilities throughout and
under North America.  John D. Rockefeller, former CEO of energy monopolist
Standard Oil, is now head of Hades' energy management division.  Said
Rockefeller, "Obviously Hell has significant heating demands.  While
eternal flames are a great idea in concept, they require vast and reliable
fuel
resources.  Enron was the only supplier willing to make a deal with my
boss, and, as a former monopolist, I just like the way they do business."

A spokesperson for Enron said the two cultures were able to work easily
together during negotiations.  According to the company, "The deal fits
both companies exceptionally well.  With Hades' ability to attract and
retain new customers, we see this as a fabulous growth opportunity for
millennia to come."  According to several energy industry insiders,
Hades' high heating demand with very little need for summer air conditioning
make it a very attractive energy portfolio addition.

Hades is a multinational corporation with millions of sites worldwide and
approximately 173 quintillion customers.  The entity boasts sustained
high growth rates over the last two thousand years.

Enron is one of the world's leading energy and communications
companies. The company owns approximately $37 billion in energy and
communications assets.  Enron ranks in the top quarter of Fortune's "Best
100
Companies
to Work For if You Can Keep A Job There and Don't Mind Working 80 Hours A
Week," and is among the most respected corporations in America, as ranked
by customers with respect-us-or-get-curtailed clauses in their energy supply
contracts.

Mr. Pushaw:
Whats up my friend.  It's been a long while-too long.  The last time I saw 
you was when I was in New York for the marathon and saw you at that Italian 
rest.  I've been keeping up with gioffre (sp) as of late and noticed your 
e-mail address, so I wanted to give you a shout.  How's everything at law 
school going?  Will you be staying in NYC after you graduate?  I may be in 
NYC next year going to B-School at Columbia.  I'm down here in Houston 
working with Enron.  It's been a great experience but I'm ready to go back to 
school to get my MBA.  Please give me a call when you have some time and lets 
catch up.  My work number is (713)853-7998 and home is (713) 355-8738.  Hope 
all is going well and talk to you soon.  See ya
Ben

Here is a presentation I need by 12:00 this morning.  I need 1 set of 
transparencies and 40 color copies, where these copies are stapled and 
three-holed punched at the top.  If graphics can "clean it" up a little bit 
that would be great..  I am trying to finish one more slide in this 
presentation but please go forward with this due to time constraints.  Please 
give me a call if you have any questions. Thanks

Basic summary for Teco:

Still working with Finance Group to come up with different finance structures.
Working with Insurance group (weather desk) to wear the risk of the project, 
since the Power desk will not wear that type of risk.
Pricing of the put, call and spread option values is still not finalized, 
because Kevin Presto has said that he does not put much value into these 
plants in Eastern PJM
Don Black is beginning to look at other companies for his price risk 
management product.  
He feels he will not be able to get a deal done with Teco at this point in 
time.

Let me know if this is suffient for your analysis.

Sorry for the late reply, I was in NYC and Boston on one of my deals.  The 
two companies I talked about was Relient and Entergy.  Relient ended up 
buying 19 LM 6000 turbines and Entergy ended up buying 28 LM 6000 turbines.  
They both plan to put them into customer deals, just as we are doing - so 
there is a little competition.  The delivery dates are a little further out 
than ours but they all are probably delivered by 2003.  Hope this helps. Talk 
to you soon.

NYC for the week - its her spring break.  I am finding out whether I can send 
your parents the tickets early or if we will meet them at the "will call 
window" at the RCA Dome.  These are box seats so I don't know if we can get 
them earlier or not.  Looks like it going to be a very interesting Final

 Thanks for the informative infomation session this past Friday.  Also, thank 
you for taking the time to listen to my situation regarding my application 
and talking to Dr. Harris for me.  After meeting with many of the faculty and 
staff (Professors Brown, Titman, Jemison & Ronn) at the School, my desire to 
attend the School is quite strong.  The School is a perfect fit for the 
career I am trying to pursue in energy and is a institution where I would be 
able to contribute to and learn from the energy-finance program due to my 
experiences with Enron.  Eventhough I have tested poorly on tests such as the 
GMAT, I feel that the rest of my application is quite strong and that I have 
proven that I can successfully compete in a competitive environment (ie. 
Enron).  I excel in environments (team-oriented) such as described by the 
many people I talked with at the Texas B-School.  
 Again, thanks for taking the time to talk with me about my application and 
it was good to see someone from Boston, who lived in DC and was now living in 
Texas, such as myself.  

Regards,

Ben Rogers

In regards to the LD's, we do not agree with these LD's at this high level.  
In regards to the 5 year warrenty, I think we are only interested in a one

Don:

To confirm that we have scheduled a nominal two hour call on Monday (10/30)
at 1:30 CST to warp up the Peaker operational due diligence.  Duke has
arranged for a call in number  800/473-8492.  The conference host is Joe
Synnott.

Our focus on this call will be to review the status of our outstanding
requests and open questions.  An example of the former category are the
inspection reports at Gleason and the gas questions.  In the latter
category we still have some confusion about the units actual vs. guaranteed
performance data, status of the warranty items, historic transmission
performance, and relationship between the facility operations team and the
asset management function in Houston.    In addition our insurance staff
will be participating and will have some questions about the casualty loss
histories at the facilities.

Organizationally: please make available people on your team knowledgeable
in the operation and asset management of the facilities.  I would suggest
Ross, the plant managers, Mitch, and your environmental team.

Any questions, please don't hesitate to give me a call at 713-627-6579.

Thanks for the reply.  I can understand your position.  I am looking more for 
a refresher course.  I am planning on taking it around mid December or as 
late as mid January.  I am beginning to start studying again on my own, but I 
wanted to get a little more help.  Thanks for your call!

Do you actually have the Henwood report.  It looks like you sent me the RW 
Beck report or a letter pertaining to the Henwood report, but not the actual 
Henwood report that I was looking at in the meeting.  Thanks!

I talked to Mary Lou on Thursday afternoon and she said that we were all set 
with tickets (6) in the box seats.  Does this sound correct?  Thanks for your 
help in getting these tickets.  Hope you had a good weekend.

Tom Swank, the originator and I sat down with Bruce Golden and went through 
the porject cost numbers for the GE 7FA combined cycle facility.  At this 
point we need to claculate FOM and VOM and other operating expenses.  We feel 
pretty good about the project cost numbers.  Let me know if you need more 
info than I have already given you.  Bruce Golden has the soft copy of the 
project cost numbers.  Thanks

_______________________________________________________________

The following questions were raised by our review of the draft
environmental schedules on Dealbench.

LV Cogen I and II

1.  Schedule 4.1(i) references an annual audit of the CEM system in May
2000.  Is this audit on Dealbench and/or can we get a copy of it?

2.  Please provide a copy and/or reference to a Dealbench document for the
Phase I referenced on Schedule 4.1(n).

3.  Please provide copies and/or references to Dealbench documents for the
items listed as 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 on Schedule 4.1(u).  [Note that we have
reviewed the 1995 storm water permit, but did not see an indication that it
is automatically renewed.  Is this reflected elsewhere?]

Wheatland, Gleason and Lincoln

1.  We noticed that Schedule 4.1(u) for each facility indicates that an
SPCC is needed but not currently in place.  What is stored that triggers
the SPCC requirement?  How long have these materials been stored at the
facilities?

Please feel free to call me if you have any questions or if you would like
to discuss these issues in further detail.  Thanks.

Just wanted to say congratulations on the close.  I hope you had a good trip 
back to Cincy.  Again, I think that both companies are getting a very good 
deal, with you guys getting excellent assets at a very good price.  Hope to 
talk to you soon and I look forward to seeing the press release.
Regards, 
Ben

Hey Dan:
It was good to see you the other day.  It's funny because I had tried to send 
you an e-mail, after talking to Andrew about the paper.  It's great eveything 
is going well.  I'm running the NYC Marathon in two weeks so my weekends are 
mostly about running, but after that I would like to get together for some 
golf.  Talk to you soon.

Hey ,
I checked on the tickets and she is sending them to me and I will send them 
to you.  She mention that they are for the 15th, which is a Friday, I guess a 
night game but I'm not sure.  I recall your most recent e-mail as stating the 
16th - is that right.  If so, I hope their wasn't a screwup on anyone's 
part.  Please let me know.  Thanks
Ben

Good to hear from you!  It's been a while.  I am also going to work for 
another year.  My undergrad grades were what held me back.  I have already 
enrolled in a summer graduate finance course for the summer.  How Fun!  I am 
also retaking the GMAT.  But what I am looking forward to is kicking your ass 
in the NYC Marathon since I signed up and will hopefully get in.  Megan will 
is almost done with school and will be spending most of July in NY.  So I 
will be coming up to NYC quite a bit this summer.  Would you be interested in 
going out to Colorado this summer to play some great golf.  They have some 
fantastic courses.  Other than that - work is going really well and Enron 
stock and company culture is really getting noticed by Wall Street, which is 
great for future job opportunities.  I'm playing a lot of tennis, golf anf 
basketball as of late and its been quite fun.  Hope all is going well and 
lets get together when you get back.  See ya soon.
Ben

Were all set.  You and your dad should fly into Indianapolis Saturday morning 
or early afternoon.  You need to look on a Website for when the games begin 
that day.  We are actually flying into Cinci and driving over.   Again, look 
at a website to see what time the Final game is on Monday night.  Give me a 
call so when can go over meeting before the game to get you the tickets.  
Talk to you soon.  Work number is (713) 853-7998.

Hey Mike:
You won't believe whose wedding Megan and I are going to in early Oct. - 
Marlon and Marissa's.  As well as OB, Choby, Mike and like Patty Donahue, 
Sammy, Amy, etc.  It should be pretty interesting to say the least.  I am 
also running in this year's NYC Marathon which falls on the first Sunday in 
November.  So trying to get to the east coast for a third time has been tough 
to arrange.  How was Patty's wedding -it looked like alot of fun.  I still 
want to meet up with you guys somewhere, but I'm just not sure where at this 
point - I still think DC.  Let me know what you think.

Jim:
Scott and I are working with Kinder/Morgan on pricing a 3 year deal off of 
one of their facilities.  These are the facilities that we looked at late 
last year for buying 2 of their plants.  The plants have a configuration of: 
6 LM 6000's, 2 GE 7EA's and steam turbine.  They are able to run in at peak, 
swing and base load levels very easily.  They are looking for a 3 year  term 
deal for 510 MW's, with $1.00 VOM and Heat Rate of 8,531 located in Little 
Rock, ARK..  Pricing starts June 02 and goes to Cal. 04.  Anyway, I want to 
know if you guys are able to meet tomorrow at 2:00pm to talk about pricing up 
this deal.   It should only take about 15-25 minutes.  Thanks for your time.

Regards,
Ben

Here is the VOM and FOM for a 4 GE 7EA plant in Vicksburg, MS.
VOM = $0.88
Annual FOM = $915,000
These numbers are a good estimate based off of our Caledonia plant, which is 
currently operating in the TVA region.  Please give me a call if you have any 
questions.  Thanks!

This weekend is out of the question - the BIG race is on Sunday up in the Big 
Apple.  Megan and I leave for NYC on Friday afternoon.  We will be getting

Guys:
Don Miller and I would like to set some time up with you, today if possible, 
to talk about state and local tax issues for the 2000 peakers.  I will talk 
with Don about a good time to meet and let you know.  But let me know what is 
a good time for you this afternoon.  Thanks for your time.

The Teco meeting will be held Monday at 2:00 pm in room 3125.  If you have 
any questions please give me a call.  The main issue will be the current

Mike:

Thanks again for taking the time to meet with me last week.  I left you Rich 
Kinder's number on Thursday with your assistant, Sheilla - hope you got it.  
Again, I think a deal between or three companies is something to really look 
at.  I think it creates a great story to the street.  Kinder/Morgan brings 
the growth story, the gas pipelines for the convergence play and the 
development team, Enron brings the MW's and trading and Cinergy brings MW's, 
trading and operating expertise.  I feel that Enron and Cinergy can work 
togther with regards to the trading.  I am sending you an anayst report I 
just finish reading regarding generation spinoffs - I think it will be 
helpful.   Also, Kay Chapman, Dave's assistant informed me that you were 
coming up next week, and I wanted to know if you wanted me to be there or not 
or if you wanted me to prepare anything for you for the meeting.  

Hope you had a good weekend and I look forward to talking to you soon.
Regards,
Ben

Subject: Additional Questions


I received a call from Tom Favinger at PG&E today.  He is looking for the
responses to his questions from last week and also has a new question.  He
would like to get a breakout of the $10.25 million item in the Pastoria
capital budget labeled Pre-Commercial Operations Costs.

I also spoke to Darryn O Llegas from PECO today.  They are planning to bid
on the peakers and LV Cogen on Friday.  His questions are:

Peakers

* Will Enron's control area dispatching/scheduling software be
included in the property conveyed with the peakers?
* Do the Peaker's permits make any allowance for combined cycle
operation or would they need to re-start the permitting process?
* They would like clarification concerning the joint ownership of gas
interconnects - what is owned, cost to maintain, etc.

LV Cogen

* Update on status of Phase II permitting?
* Update on status of development process?
* Are there any tax abatements of any type for the Phase II project?

Additional Comments from PECO:

* Don't have price curves yet for all of the peakers markets - will
need to develop prior to final bid.
* May have a concern re: market power for the peakers as a result of
the PECO/Unicom merger.  They will be comfortable enough to bid this week
and don't expect it to be a concern for the final bid.
* They will probably submit a bid with separate values for: Wheatland;
other peakers together; LV Cogen.
* They are working their bid from two perspectives: replacement cost
plus a premium and discounted cash flow.  DCF will obviously change as they
get their price curves updated.

I wanted to send out an e-mail to everyone who is involved with the site 
visits.  We started the site visits this past Friday with a company going to 
Wheatland.  The site visits will begin tomorrow and run through the the 27th 
of Ocotber.  Here is the schedule for this weeks site visits:

Dave Kristich will be covering Gleason from tonight/tomorrow morning till 
Friday afternoon (17th-20th)

Ross and Fred will be covering Lincoln from Tuesday night to Friday afternoon 
( 18th-20th)

Chris and Jeff will be covering Wheatland from tonight through Friday 
afternnon (17th-20th)

If you have any conflicts with this schedule for this week, please let me 
know as soon as possible so I can arrange someone else to cover for you.  

Next week, the Gleason and Wheatland plants will have a company visiting the 
sites everyday and for Lincoln, Wednesday and Thursday are currently booked, 
so please plan accordingly to be at the site during that time period.  
Currently, these dates are NOT subject to change, but we are still waiting to 
hear from two more companies.  I will let you know ASAP when they call and 
confirm their times to visit the sites. 
Please give me a call if you have any questions or need anymore information.  
Again, thank you for all your help with the site visits.

Regards,
Ben

Hey man - good to hear from you.  It must be rough house sitting in River 
Oaks, just remember to leave the furniture before you go back to school.  
Next week would be great to get some brews.  My wife and I are moving this 
weekend so it is quite hectic this week.  I will need a lot of booze after 
this move!  How's Chase?  I'll talk to you soon.
Ben

I just wanted to let you know that I sent this letter to Dr. Harris addresses 
his concerns and stating my commitment to succeeding at The Texas Graduate 
School of Business.  I hope I have done what it takes to prove that I can 
succeed at the School.  Thanks again for your help and interest. 

Sincerely,
Ben

Raymond:
I work at Enron, in our corporate development group and have been through 
many different analyst reports.  I went through your previous "The Power 
Curve" report and enjoyed it thoroughly and recently heard that the second 
version is out and wanted to get a copy.  If that's possible that would be 
great.  Thanks in advance for this request.

David Parquet asked me to forward these answers to you:
Question:
Is the major maintenance reserve estimate based on a negotiated Long Term
Services Agreement (LTSA)?  If so, will it be in place and transfer with
PEF?
Answer:  We have not negotiated an LTSA with anyone at this time, and we do 
not expect to have one in place to transfer with PEF.  The maintenance 
reserve is our estimate based on industry data and information from GE.

Question: Are spare parts for the first major overhaul included anywhere in 
the
capital cost estimate or are they assumed to be purchased through the
maintenance reserve estimate (i.e. the LTSA) charge?

Answer:  The maintenance reserve is intended to include parts and labor for 
the overhaul.

I can't believe it -those Hoosiers actually beat a good team.  I'll admit 
that UK is not a real team this year- they need better point guards and a

This is the model from KN regarding their 4 LM 6000 Plant and their other 
plant which has 6 LM 6000's and I EA.  These numbers are hard to follow so 
they probably won't make a lot of since, without me going through them with 
you, which we can do when I get back.  I will be back tomorrow night and will 
be checking my messages.

We are not going to send back this investor list anymore.  I am going to send 
both you and James an update each night that we send something out, but only 
you guys make changes to the Investor List.  Also make sure that you still 
send the signed CA down to us even if there are not any changes to the CA, we 
need to have our legal team go through it first.  Thanks!

With regards to our conversation yesterday, I am loking for basic economics 
regarding GE 7FA's.  Such as, 1. output per turbine; 2. output for 4 7FA and 
2 steam turbines; 3.  Heat Rates; and 4. cost per turbine and steam turbine.  
Total plant output will need to be 1000 MW's and will be run as a combined 
cycle facility.  If you could get me these numbers by the end of the day or 
call me to discuss what you currently have that would be great.  This project 
is not due till Wednesday.  Thanks

I just wanted to let you know that I got out UT Business School's application 
on Thursday, so they received it on Friday.  Megan and I are thinking about 
going down to Austin some time soon to see the school and see Austin.  Megan 
has never been down there, so if you guys would be interested in going down 
to Austin with maybe Brandon and Allison, that would be alot of fun.  Let me 
know.  If you could send an e-mail or a letter to the person you know at 
Texas that would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks

Subject: TECO-Answer to Chris Smith questions

Chris,


Hopefully the following points should answer your questions. Feel free to=
=20
call me (34292) if you still have any question.

Yvan




1_  We will value Teco as a series of hourly Spread options.=20
Legitimate points of concern:=20
a) Are we valuing an index deal or a physical deal?
  b) If it is a physical deal can the plant realistically react on an hourl=
y=20
basis?

Answer: The deal Enron enters into is based on an spread between PJM index=
=20
and the appropriate OIL curve (New York Harbor + basis). However, the trigg=
er=20
for the default of the contract (which is really what we are concerned with=
)=20
is a function of the plant cash flows compared to the debt level. The plant=
=20
cash flows depend on the physical operations of the plant and its capacity =
to=20
dispatch during the most expensive hours of the year. Therefore the questio=
n=20
of whether the plant can or cannot ramp up quickly enough to dispatch=20
economically is very pertinent to our valuation.=20
I would argue that the plant will always (or almost always) be able to=20
dispatch economically for the following 2 reasons. In the first place, its=
=20
operational ramp up time is only 10 minutes. Secondly, the scalar curve we=
=20
use is fairly well behaved and doesn=01,t swing around a mean position (see=
=20
graph below), hence allowing sufficient preparation for the dispatchers. Th=
e=20
chances of dispatchers being caught by surprise when prices spike up or dow=
n=20
should therefore be relatively small, and the plant should be able to follo=
w=20
the real time prices pretty well.





2_ The power curve we use is PJM west. Even though the plant is located in=
=20
the south east end of PJM (i.e. the del Marva peninsula), we prefer not to=
=20
use the east curve which is too thinly traded to be meaningful.=20

4_ So far we have only used monthly vol for power. Should we start using=20
daily vol as well, then the blending formula would be:
'fvol =3D Sqr((dblMvol * dblMvol * (jDate - jToday) + dblDvol * dblDvol * 1=
5) /=20
(jDate - jToday + 15))

with  jDate the first of the considered month of dispatch
 dblMvol the monthly vol
 dblDvol the daily vol

6_ We are assuming 50% flat correlation for 20 years (a much more=20
conservative assumption than 15%). However we run sensitivities where the=
=20
correlation goes from 30% to 70%.

7_ Yes, we are deducting all operative expenses from the valuation.=20
Origination is currently trying to reconcile the differences in operations=
=20
expenses between their numbers and those used by credits.

8_ The valuation model (coded by Alex Huang, Research) is based on a=20
bidimensional tree, and therefore doesn=01,t use the SPRDOPT function. Howe=
ver,=20
we checked that the SPRDOPT function from the structuring model and the tre=
e=20
based model yielded the same values for the spread option.

9_ The strike for the spread option is the sum of the OIL price + the VOM.

Please send me an excel spreadsheet which depicts the value that you see=20
associated with the heat rate spread option.  I want to make sure that I=20
understand exactly how you propose valuing the transaction and how this val=
ue=20
would be booked.  As such, please provide the following detail:

Will we be valuing/booking a series of monthly call options or a series of=
=20
daily call options?
What power curve are we valuing the deal against - PJM East or West Hub?
Please send me the current fuel curve that you are converting to $/MWh to=
=20
value the deal?
What volatilities are you using to value the options - monthly volatilities=
=20
or intra-day volatilities or a blend of the two (if blending please show me=
=20
what formula you using to blend the two vols)?
What expiration date are you using, i.e.: for monthly call options the 15th=
=20
of the relevant month, and for daily options?
What correlation are you assuming, 15% flat for twenty years?
Are you deducting all operating expenses from the value of the option?
Are you using the "SPRDOPT" Exotic Options function to value the option?
Are you using the $/MWh VOM dollar amount as your strike?
Has Don provided the fixed payment stream?  This stream should be covering=
=20
both P&I and not just principal.

Yvan, and Ben, please provide answers to these question via written=20
correspondence so that their is limited probability of misunderstanding. =
=20
Thank you both very much for your time and help thus far.  Furthermore, I=
=20
would like to reiterate that RAC's goal, prior to quoting any credit reserv=
e,=20
is to be 100% confident that: (i) the methodology that is being employed is=
=20
consistent among the internal groups; and (ii) the inherent value of the=20
price risk management contracts matches.  This enables RAC to manage the=20
associated risk during the life of the transaction both effectively and=20
appropriately.

Regards,

Christopher

I am working with Kinder/Morgan on pricing a 3 year deal off of one of their 
facilities.  These are the facilities that we looked at late last year for 
buying 2 of their plants.  The plants have a configuration of: 6 LM 6000's, 2 
GE 7EA's and steam turbine.  They are able to run in at peak, swing and base 
load levels very easily.  They are looking for a 3 year  term deal for 510 
MW's, with $1.00 VOM and Heat Rate of 8,531 located in Little Rock, ARK..  
Pricing starts June 02 and goes to Cal. 04.  Anyway, I want to know if you 
guys are able to meet tomorrow at 2:00pm to talk about pricing up this 
deal.   It should only take about 15-25 minutes.  Thanks for your time.

Ben:  Because of the short time frame I am just forwarding the questions from 
our broker (representing the surety) concerning your request for bid bond.   
Very valid questions and also will impact your performance bond should you 
win and need one.  Please try and get back to me asap as this is a very short 
time frame for the bond.  Thanks.

Teddy-We are preparing the bid bond based on the request received yesterday 
evening.  The bid specifications indicate liquidated damages in the amount of 
$2,375,000 PER DAY.  I assume Enron will not accept damages at this level.  
Please check to determine if the bid will be qualified in this area-and what 
alternative damages may be offered.  Due to the unusual size of the penalty 
relative to the contract value, this could have an impact on reinsurance.

The contract indicates a normal one year warrenty from the contractor.  The 
charge for this warrenty is included in our standard performance bond rate.  
I have bonded a number of generator contracts similar to this, and frequently 
there is an option for the contractor to offer an extended warrenty up to 5 
years.  Since this would impact the premium charged, you may want to check to 
see if this option exist so we can get the pricing correct in your estimate.

Thanks.

Dr. Harris:
Since I am a eternal optimist, I always feel I can strengthen my skills in 
most everything I do, but under these circumstances with the GMAT (timed 
exam) combined with my disability, I feel this is my best representation for 
this exam.  Also, I know that you would not what me to take the exam just to 
retake it, but due to my strong desire to attend The TEXAS Graduate School of 
Business, I would try to provide any additional information you needed to 
help strengthen my overall application file.  Again, thanks for the fast 
response to my e-mail.  Hope to hear from you soon!

Sincerely, 
Ben

Just to give you an update, I reeived an e-mail from Dr. Carl Harris, who is 
currently in charge of my application in the admission's office.  He wants me 
to answer a few questions to make sure I can handle the coursework.  That is 
why I wanted to meet with you and Professors' Titman and Brown, to discuss 
the coursework and to talk to you about my strengths and weaknesses.  I know 
that with my financial modeling and accounting skills, energy-finance 
background, and the Business' School's team-oriented approach to learning, 
that I will excel in this type of learning environment.  I hope things work 
out and thanks again for your help.

Amy:
Here are my answers  to your questions:
1.  Yes I think its a good idea, because you are able to reach a wide 
audience with this advertisement.  
2.  I don't think the contest should be limited to just these 
schools/conferences.  You probably should open it up to all schools to get an 
even wider reach of potential candidates.
3.  I would think that if you had a certain amount for the cash prize that 
people would take it seriously to try and win the cash.
4.  Please let me know if I can support you in any way.
Thanks

Yes I am working on that with Bruce Golden to reduce that.  It should be more

Program.  In the end, the results were not favorable.  I understand that it 
is a competitive process, but I felt that with my work experiences, 
recommendations, extracurricular activities, etc., that this would help my 
chances and possibly compensate for my disability.  After talking with you 
and Professors Titman, Brown and Jemison, I was sure that UT was the right 
place to continue learning about energy-finance.  
  I am still sure that UT is the place for getting an excellent 
graduate-level education, so I want you to know that I am going to do 
whatever it takes to get in next year.  I plan on taking two or three 
graduate level finance courses at the University of Houston this Summer and 
Fall to demonstrate to the Admissions office that I can compete at this 
level. I also plan on trying to retake the GMAT test.  Due to my disability, 
this will be a monumental task, but I am determined to prove to the 
Admissions commitee that I can excel with the work at The Texas University 
Graduate School of Business.  
 Thanks again for taking the time to listen and talk with me.  It has been a 
pleasure meeting you and I hope we can continue to talk about energy and 
finance in the future.  Also, if you can think of anything else I can do to 
strengthen my overall application file for next year, please let me know.  
Take care and hope to hear from you soon.

Sincerely,

Ben Rogers

I am putting together a presentation for FPL and we are going to show them 
our potential development sites.  Who do I talk to to just get the different

The water analysis that I sent you is for Gleason.  Over the weekend we put 
the other water analysis studies for the other plants on DealBench.  Please

Ben, I have a reference document called Gas Turbine World Handbook in which I 
look up these type of answers as well for ballpark info. They are the 
"preliminary answer" to your question and should be treated as so. Please 
keep in mind that these are numbers from a magazine, not from our internal 
Performance/Cycles group under Gary Bush (within EECC). They are the dept 
that the Dev Engineer typically consults with to arrive at a project's 
capacity and efficiency, both from a new & clean standpoint and an average 
degradation standpoint. The depts within EECC/NEPCO also come up with the 
total installed costs. It is their numbers that are the ones that we 
typically bid in a proforma, as such, they are a part of the deal approval 
process (DASH). Their buy in is important because in addition to the numbers 
that OEM's provide us, they factor in experience, judgement, unique project 
characteristics, design basis, intake/exhaust losses, etc. They also look at 
the net power for the Plant, not just the equipment itself. Having caveat'ed 
these numbers, I would respond to your questions below as follows:

1. PG7241FA Capacity: 171,700 kW each @ generator terminals (ISO conditions, 
gas fired @ baseload) -- does not include auxiliaries usage, duct losses
2. 1,060 MW Net Plant @ ISO, gas fired
3. 6,040 Btu/kWh LHV @ ISO, gas fired
4. Plug figure for GTG may be $32,500,000 each. No idea on the ST, swag at 
$175/kW. Power island turnkey for 2x1 may be $375/kW (does not include alot 
of stuff such as add'l options, development costs, tie-ins, permitting, 
spares, etc, etc, etc)

Hope this is useful to you somehow, but please go to the source (described 
above) for anything that we are going to hang our hat on.

With regards to our conversation yesterday, I am loking for basic economics 
regarding GE 7FA's.  Such as, 1. output per turbine; 2. output for 4 7FA and 
2 steam turbines; 3.  Heat Rates; and 4. cost per turbine and steam turbine.  
Total plant output will need to be 1000 MW's and will be run as a combined 
cycle facility.  If you could get me these numbers by the end of the day or 
call me to discuss what you currently have that would be great.  This project 
is not due till Wednesday.  Thanks
Ben

Just wanted to keep you all informed of my recent discussions with Kinder 
Morgan regarding potentially selling them 4 LM 6000's.  At first they were 
interested in some of the development sites, but became more interested in 
the equipment.  They are trying to get their hands on as many LM 6000's as 
possible, because of their plant configuration utilizing 6 LM 6000's per 
plant.  With my last dicussion as of yesterday (Tuesday the 5th), I gave them 
the approximate price at which they could buy the turbines for - $15,000,000 
per turbine.  Their comment was it was a little on the high side, but they 
still sounded interested because of the quick time frame of receiving them - 
1st Qtr. '01.  If they are still interested they will get back with me with a 
non-binding term sheet within the next couple of weeks.  Please let me know 
if you have any comments.  Thank you!
Ben

The rumor was going around we were going to buy them back, but wasn't pre 
announced or anything.  See ya

Here is the e-mail that Bruce just sent me.  Make sure that you do not use 
this for any binding agreements or client discussion purposes.  These are the 
numbers I have used in my model and here are the new Plano numbers.  If you 
have any questions please give me a call and I will walk you through the 
changes.  Thanks

Don:
I put in a call to Kinder/Morgan this morning.  I have not heard back from 
Anthony Lannie, who will be heading up this process for them.  Again, I think 
they will be interested, but probably through a joint bid with Southern.    I 
will continue to follow up with these guys to measure there interest.

Is the major maintenance reserve estimate based on a negotiated Long Term
Services Agreement (LTSA)?  If so, will it be in place and transfer with
PEF?

Are spare parts for the first major overhaul included anywhere in the
capital cost estimate or are they assumed to be purchased through the
maintenance reserve estimate (i.e. the LTSA) charge?

First of all you may be skinny, but your a skinny geek - oh does that sound?  
I am sending in my application in this week.  Regarding grad school, I have 
gotten a couple of no's, but haven't heard from all the school's, but I am 
considering a position with an investment bank in NYC in their global power 
M&A Group.  Good money but I would put off grad school a couple of years and 
by that time who knows, maybe night school at that time.  I am training for 
the MS 150, which is th 170 mile bike race to Austin.  And you call me 
fatty!!  I'm heading the the Final Four next week - I ended up getting Mike 
Gioffre's Dad a couple of tickets, so he will in Indy.  OB and I went out to 
dinner in NYC when I was up their last week.  We went to a really expensive 
sushi place - it was awesome.  He seams to be doing well - he is considering 
going to a dot.com.  Gotta go!  I'll talk to you soon.

Amy:
I called a while back to get into the Enron class which you helped me get 
into and I just recently left you a message to take private sessions from the 
Princeton Review.  I have realized that I need  one on one  sessions to help 
me really prepare for the GMAT.  If you can point me in the right direction, 
I would greatly appreciate it.  I was looking to start sessions as soon as 
possible. Again, thanks for your help with this issue.

I just got back from NYC - I ran in the NYC Marathon yesterday.  It was a lot 
of fun and pretty good weather, but my time was a little slower than I would 
have wanted (4:27).  If Wednesday or Thursday works for you, I would like to 
come up to the Woodlands and meet with you over lunch.  I hope all is going 
well and I'll talk to you soon.

Megan will be at the wedding that weekend, but I will not be able to make 
it.  Megan is going to spend most of July up in New York.  How is the 
fundraising business going?  I heard that Clinton's fundraiser tonight will 
bring in $23 million which will be $2 Mil. more than George W., which would 
be pretty impressive.

More Questions:

Both Plants

1.  What are the short term NOx and CO emissions during startups, and are
there limitations during start-ups.

2.  Are industrial stormwater permits required at either site?

Caledonia

3.  In Caledonia, what is the custom fuel sampling schedule?

Brownsville

4.  What is the agency's response to the Enron letter regarding the 2nd
stormwater NOV?

5.  Has there been any further action by the agency since the 1st stormwater
NOV was never responded to?

6.  One memo stated that the stormwater is channeled to a wetland.  Was that
during construction only or is it ongoing?

7.  Were there any further problems with the B T Readymix concrete dumping

Here is a presentation that I need by 11:00am Thursday.  The presentation is 
almost complete,  but if you can clean it up that would be great.   I will 
need 8 coler copies and bound. Please give me a call before you have someone 
run the copies, because we may have some early morning changes. Thanks

 The meeting Don and I had with Kinder/Morgan to discuss his Price Risk 
Management Product went really well.  We met with Park Schaper (CFO), Anthony 
Lannie (President of Power Group) and Jay Hopper (VP and General Manager) was 
on the phone from Denver.  They were very interested with regards to 
potentially replacing long term tolling agreements with this product.  Enron 
could provide a five year toll and the product would begin in the sixth year 
through year 15 or 20.  
 We talked very little about their existing projects; Little Rock and 
Michigan.  They do have all the permits for the Little Rock site and are 
moving forward with the Michigan site and still do not have any tolling 
agreements in place for those projects. 
 The ball is currently in their court and were going to get back with Scot 
with respects to the projects and with Tom on the PRM Product.  Please let me 
know if you have any questions with this matter.  Thanks!

DO YOU THINK HE WOULD??
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
 Al Gore and 
Constitution 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
, 2000 WorldNetDaily.com 

Ever since I saw Al Gore give that uncharacteristically statesman-like speech 
defending the integrity of the Electoral College system under the 
Constitution of the United States, I've been scratching my head trying to 
figure it out. 

Who was this guy? Was this the same Al Gore who has demonstrated -- time and 
time again -- so little respect for the Constitution during the last eight 
years? Why was he giving up on the idea of a challenge to the Electoral 
College, when it seemed many in his camp were banking on that as their last 
line of defense? 

Well, I think I have figured it out. Actually, there are two possibilities. 

The first thought that came to me was that this was Al Gore's 
"Don't-watch-the-man-behind-the-curtain speech." While he was extolling the 
virtues of the Constitution, his minions in Florida -- from Bill Daley to 
Jesse Jackson -- were busy subverting it by any means necessary. It was Al 
Gore's way of establishing public plausible deniability. He stood above the 
fray, while his cohorts did the dirty work. 

But, more recently, another thought has occurred to me -- a darker, more 
sinister thought. I hope I am wrong. I pray that, this time, I am 
overestimating the deviousness of Al Gore. But that, of course, is always a 
difficult task. 

Think, for a moment, why Al Gore would suddenly be reading and citing the 
Constitution. 

The answer is that, in this instance, it gives him all the power. What do I 
mean? 

Who is it, under the Constitution, that is specifically charged with 
certifying the Electoral College votes of each state? You guessed it. The 
president of the U.S. Senate, which also happens to be the vice president of 
the United States. That's right. The day those Electoral College votes go to 
the Senate to be counted and certified to choose the next president of these 
United States, Al Gore will be holding all the cards. 

"Oh, Farah," you say, "you don't think Al Gore would tamper with the results 
in any way with the whole world watching, do you?" 

Well, let's think about what has been happening in Florida for the last 
several days. Al Gore's campaign managers have been whipping up hysteria 
stating that the will of the people in that state is being subverted. 

They are filing lawsuits. They are organizing marches. They are all but 
accusing the Bush campaign of voter fraud. 

Listen to what Bill Daley has to say: "More than 100 million Americans voted 
on Tuesday and more voted for Al Gore than George Bush. Here in Florida it 
also seems very likely that more voters went to the polls believing that they 
were voting for Al Gore than for George Bush. If the will of the people is to 
prevail Al Gore should be awarded a victory in Florida, and be our next 
president of the United States." 

They've decided that no matter what the actual vote count shows, Gore wins. 

Now, all Gore has to do on that fateful day in the U.S. Senate is reject for 
certification the Electoral College votes of Florida, and he wins the 
majority and becomes president. Sorry, Bush fans. I don't think there's a 
thing you can do about it other than protest, complain and stomp your feet. 
Better start planning your legal strategy now. I'll bet Al Gore's transition 
team is already hard at work. Barbra Streisand is probably making plans to 
sing at the Inauguration. Alec Baldwin is unpacking his bags. This could be a 
fait accompli. I guarantee you a counter to this bold move is not in the Bush 
campaign's playbook. 

The Gore campaign, still working overtime, has laid the groundwork for the 
challenge. The Florida vote is tainted, they say. It's too close to call. Too 
many irregularities. The vote can simply be dismissed by the constitutional 
authority -- Vice President Al Gore. 

Would you put it past him? I sure wouldn't.

Dr. Ueng:
I wanted to mention this to you yesterday after the test, but didn't have 
time.  I was taking this course because I am applying to another business 
school and since I have been out of school for six years I wanted to provide 
the other schools with a recent academic record.  I was trying to get an A in 
the class, but my first test was not my best work. I feel that I did much 
better on the second test and that Brandon and mines case studies and my 
class participation were good enough to get me close to the A level.  That 
said if I am also able to get a recommendation from you I would greatly 
appreciate it.  I know that you are extremely busy now, so if I could get in 
touch with you at your earliest convenience that would be great.  Thanks for 
making the class educational and quite enjoyable.  Hope to talk to you soon 
and hope you can enjoy the rest of the summer.  

Regards,
Ben Rogers

Here are the new Plano numbers and the revised Homestead numbers.  Please 
only use these for discussion and model purposes and not with client 
conversations.  These are all indicative cost numbers.  Give me a call if you 
have any questions.  Thanks

Subject: Plano vs Homestead

Ben



This is a revised Plano we did late yesterday. It was adjusted from Lowell, 
Mass Nepco estimate and we changed format to more closely match  Homestead 
form.

Biggest differences 'tween original Plano and original Homestead were:

Homestead had dual fuel     +4M
Homestead had additional piling and foundation bulks  +1.8M
Homestead was connecting to a complicated t-line config +1.5M
Homestead had an FPL substation    +5M
Homestead did not need as much gas pipeline    -2.1M
Homestead used 6% margin     +4.4M
Homestead had lower capacity due to additional chilling  +1.5% (not capital 
cost but does change $/kW)

Differences from original Plano to new Plano is that Nepco has estimated a 
union job for Lowell. This impacts indirects upward by about $5M and 
construction up above my earlier guesstimate by about $4M. I had doubled the 
cost per manhour which Nepco also did but additionally they added manhours 
for productivity loss. Additionally I moved new Plano margin to 6%.

New Homestead went up due to raw water pretreatment and first stage RO but we 
dropped the substation cost so total estimated cost went down by a coupla of 
million.

Numbers still just should be used for screening, no commitment. 

These summaries should not be passed around.

I'm heading into a peaker meeting at 9:00, but will be out in 30 minutes or 
so.  I talked to Jerry this morning and the best time to talk with him is 
this morning before 10:00 our time.  Let's try and talk with him about the 
remaining issues this morning so we can work on them from our end to 
eventually talk with him later today.  Thanks!

Things are going well here in the States.  Work is very busy right now and i 
am actually training to  do the MS 150 Bike race.  It a race from Houston to 
Austin.  It's a 170 mile, two day ride with about 5,000 bikers.  It's on 
April 16th and 17th.  I rode this weekend only 40 miles.  Yes I am going todo 
the NYC Marathon and for you virgins, I will kick your fat asses.  Darnit, I 
wanted a pet Camel for our apartment.  Yes I got your message last week - I 
had just stepped away from my desk and just missed you.  When do you get 
back?  Sometime in the Summer.  By the summer I hope to be in the 185 range, 
currently I'm right at 200!!!  Not very good.  I have been talking with Mike 
Gioffre lately and were trying to get people together this spring or summer.  
I'll let you know when.  Gotta go, but I'll talk to you soon.

I talked to Bruce on Friday around 5:00pm and they are getting us, as well as 
Nepco, the scope document on Wednesday.  Nepco will take till the following 
Monday to turn the doc. around.  I told him we need it sooner than that, but 
he seems to think that is the standard time of return.  We need to find out 
from Reed more information regardin the configuration, noise, water, etc.  We 
will meet with Bruce on Wednesday.  We also may want to think about going up 
there with an Engineer to visit the site.  We can talk more on Monday.

Here are the answers to your questions.
With regards to the air permit to construct application, Jinsung will send it 
to you by email today, if he hasn't already;
The Petition for Alternate testing, has been sent to you;
3.     This is a one time report to the State's emergency planning committee, 
the local emergency response department, and the local fire department 
declaring the presence of sulfuric acid and lead in quantities greater than 
500 lb and 10,000 lb, respectively.  These notifications are being mailed out 
today. 
4.     We are in the process of tracking down the analytical data associated 
with the Lake Acquisition property and will hopefully have that to you later 
today.

I hope this helps and please give us a call if you have any more questions.  
Thanks!

Mr. Titman:
Thanks for your fast reply.  Regarding Friday the 18th, I currently have a 
1:00 pm information session and a meeting with someone in the Admissions 
Office at 3:00 pm.  How does the morning work for you?  I look forward to 
meeting with you.  Thanks again!

Ben

I have moved into a new group (M&A group).  I am still working a little bit 
with the originators, but not nearly as much as before.  Hope things are 
going well with the CTG people.

Press release looked good.  You probably haven't had a chance to talk to 
Dave.  Yesterday he was in the PRC meetings all day and today is the Enron 
board meeting, where he is giving a presentation.  I did talk to Kay, his 
assistant, and he was planning on returning your call today.  Again, congrats 
on the release.

This is a test to see if you are checking your e-mail these days.  I have a 
feeling that you have not been, due to your board presentation last week.  
Mike M. tells me he will be up there today - hope that goes well for you 
guys.  I really think there could be something there.  Please give me a call 
sometime soon.  Things are going well here and we have been quite busy.  Give 
me a call sometime.  The number is (713) 853-7998. See ya!

The tab in the file titled 2000 Peakers is a consolidated list.  The other 
tabs are just tabs I used to gather information and are currently not used.  
I hope this clears things up.  Give me a call if you have any more

Thanks for the note, except of course for the last comment, why don't you 
just go seat in row 100 - alright.  Megan and I had a great time and enjoyed 
having you guys come out..  I love going out there during the summer.  We are 
going to arrange a ski weekend on President Day Weekend this February - so 
make plans to be laughed at while skiing.  I didn't mean laughed at - I meant 
having a fun time.  Talk to you soon.

Dr. Harris:
Sorry for the delay, I have been traveling with work and I just got back an 
hour ago.  I can try and retake the GMAT exam if this will help my overall 
application file.  I must say, due to my disability, I don't think my score 
would improve dramatically.  I can also send you a summary (or the whole 
report) on my disability from the professional examiner to further explain my 
disability.  I can also provide addition recommendations from my colleagues I 
work with to further demonstrate my achievements at work.  If you could let 
me know what information would help best  explain my disability, I would 
appreciate it.  Thanks again for your e-mail and sorry for the delay.

 Thanks for your quick reply.  With regards to the classes, I looked into U 
of H for summer classes and they did not provide graduate level summer 
classes.  The only school that provided graduate level summer classes was the 
University of St. Thomas.  It would have been nice to take these classes at U 
of H, because our Chairman and CEO and my recommender to The Texas Business 
School, Ken Lay, received his PhD from there.  
 Thanks again for your response and advice and hope all is going well.

Regards,
Ben

Here is the model that Delmarva sent to us, which needs to be run through a 
WinZip file.  You may want to check it against the previous model they sent 
to us to see what has changed.  I will be putting together questions on the 
model they sent over.  Let me know when you would like to sit down and go 
through them.  Bruce - you may want to go through it to check the O&M 
assumptions.  Bruce, if you have any questions please give myself or Erin 
Norris a call. Thanks

Luke:
How are ya?  How is the DC area these days?  Houston is still fucking hot and 
Enron is still doing well and the price is still screaming so things are 
good.  In response to your inquiry regarding Homecoming.  Megan and I are 
actually, if you can believe it, going to Marlon and Marissa's wedding the 
first weekend in October in NJ.  Also, OB, Chobu, Mike, Corpina and Danny, 
Patty D, Sammy, Amy, etc. are going as well - should be interesting.  I 
haven't seen some of those people for quite awhile.  I was trying to set 
something up, but that came up as well as I'm running in this year's NYC 
Marathon, which is the first Sunday in Novemebr, so trying to arrange 
something became even harder.  I still want to get together with you guys, 
but trying to figure out when and where.  Suggestions are welcomed.  Hope all 
is going well and talk to you soon.

Good to hear from you.  Have a good trip up in NYC and I will talk to you 
when you get back.  In the next couple of days pull up the Enron ticker and 
check out the other deal I have been working on.  We closed it this weekend.

Professor Titman:
 I hope you had an enjoyable summer and it didn't go too quickly.   I hope 
you remember who I am from last years application process.  I enjoyed meeting 
you last year and talking with  you regarding the curriculum and admissions 
process.  I wanted to let you know that I am still very much interested in 
attending the Business School.  
 I took your advice this summer and took a graduate level finance class 
(Financial Management), which I received an A.  I was very pleased with 
myself, because I had not taken this type of class in quite some time.  I 
have decided to take another graduate level finance class (Macroeconomics), 
which I am currently taking and runs through December.  
 I also sent my information regarding my learning disability into GMAC to try 
and receive a "special testing status" for the GMAT.   I am currently waiting 
to hear back from them with their decision.
 As you can see, I am still very much interested in attending the Business 
School for next year and I'm in the process of doing whatever I can to 
increase my application profile.  I am also sending an e-mail to Carl Harris, 
who heads up the admissions process  to inform him of these recent 
developments. 
 Please let me know if there is anything else you think I need to do to 
enhance my application profile.   Again, I hope all is going well and I look 
forward to hearing from you soon 

Regards,

Ben Rogers
Enron Corp.

Great PICS.  When do you get back?  I want to see if we can get together up 
in NYC or DC with OB and Mike.  I will be in the Hamptons for July 4th 
weekend.  It's starting to get hot down here in Houston.  Things are going 
well.  I have moveed into a new group (Enron's M&A Group) - were looking at 
some interesting deals.  We are looking at taking a company public which I 
may go work for if I can get enough equity in the deal.  The other thing that 
might happen is finally going to my pops company at a much higher position 
than I am at now, which would be great, but I would be in Ohio, booooooo.  
That way Megan and I could buy a house and potential go and get an executive 
MBA from Kellog, but these are all scenarios and if any of these play out I 
would be amazed.  My golf game is ok, but my training is starting to get 
better.  I did see that none of us made the NYC Marathon on the first go 
around.  Did you see that Jon and Kati had their baby-I didn't even know she 
was pregnant.  Shit were getting old!!!!!!!!!!   Hope all is going well and 
I'll see ya.

Hey Mike:
Marlon and Marissa's wedding was alot of fun.  Megan and I sat at the married 
table, which had Pete and Amy Fullem, Kit and her husband, Marc, Sammy and 
her husband, Jon and Dana Corpina, Dana Schuster and her husband - so as you 
can see it was pretty interesting.  The other table was Mike, OB, Choby, 
Tina, and Patty Donahue.  Mike, OB, Choby, Patty, Megan and I took a limo 
from the city to the wedding and had the limo tell 12:00, then went out till 
5:00am.  I love going to that evil city, but I love leaving it even better.  
Overall, it was fun and seems like everyone is doing well.  Dana and Jon just 
had their baby, its a girl.  I also ended up seeing Alan Waugh and Tim 
Hurley.  Hurley has gained about 200 pounds - the man is huge.  Anyway, I 
hope all is well and I'll talk to you soon.

Hey:
Sorry about not getting back sooner - I have been traveling and was away for 
Thanksgiving.  Megan and I went up to Chicago to visit one of her 5 sisters.  
M&M's wedding was fun, saw some people I haven't seen since college - pretty 
scary.  If "W" wins this election Megan and I are coming to DC to watch the 
Inaugeration and maybe go to a ball or two, so we should diffinently get 
together.  I will work on that when the time comes.  Besides, this election 
is absolutely crazy - Gore he working himself into complete retirement with 
all this contesting.  How is everything going?  What are you guys doing for 
the holiday?  Megan and I are going out west to do some skiing in Beaver 
Creek - I'm praying for powder.  Again, I hope all is going well and I'll be 
better next time about getting back to you.  Good to hear from you!

Congrats on the press release.  People that found out about it were amazed 
that we did it so quickly.  I was thinking, if you could call Ken, that would 
be great.  I know Michael is talking to Dave, but talking to Ken would really 
help my cause.  Let me know what you think.  I also am sending you a 
presentation that you will really enjoy.

I wish I had taken the Bar with that special treatment - sign me up!  The big 
race is this weekend, so I hope I don't break a leg.  We leave Friday 
afternoon and get back on Monday.  I will be walking very slow next week.  
Let's try and get together next week sometime for a little dinner.  See ya

Mr. Rogers,
Just to quickly address your questions in advance of our call in the
morning, I offer the following:

1.  The debt amount contemplated was based on assumptions given by Enron.
The rate given was $375 /kW or $120MM in debt.  This would be obtained via
a 144A Bond offering without any subdebt.

2.  There are three operating fees listed in the proforma currently:
Management fee ($600k/yr) to the Owners as contracted, O&M Fee ($300k/yr)
to the Operator contemplated to be TECO Power Services ("TPS") and the TPS
Parts Company for a spare engine.  The TPS Spare engine may be eliminated
provided we can get comfort via other methods.  The financing fees were
estimates based on discussions with Enron and our engaging CSFB.

3.  The Maintenance Reserve account is accrued based on operating hours of
the plant and planned major maintenance, as estimated by TPS (the O&M
Operator).  This reserve may be eliminated as we currently are estimating
that this plant will never reach a major outage.

I look forward to discussing these issues with you in the morning.

Regards,
Patrick Smith
TM Power Ventures

Just wanted to say thank you for the invitation to Cafe Annie next Wednesday, 
unfortunately I will not be able to make it.  I can't tell how much I enjoy 
working within ENA and in particular the East Origination Group and with 
Genco.  Thanks again for the recognition and for giving me this opportunity

DO YOU THINK HE WOULD??
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
 Al Gore and 
Constitution 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
, 2000 WorldNetDaily.com 

Ever since I saw Al Gore give that uncharacteristically statesman-like speech 
defending the integrity of the Electoral College system under the 
Constitution of the United States, I've been scratching my head trying to 
figure it out. 

Who was this guy? Was this the same Al Gore who has demonstrated -- time and 
time again -- so little respect for the Constitution during the last eight 
years? Why was he giving up on the idea of a challenge to the Electoral 
College, when it seemed many in his camp were banking on that as their last 
line of defense? 

Well, I think I have figured it out. Actually, there are two possibilities. 

The first thought that came to me was that this was Al Gore's 
"Don't-watch-the-man-behind-the-curtain speech." While he was extolling the 
virtues of the Constitution, his minions in Florida -- from Bill Daley to 
Jesse Jackson -- were busy subverting it by any means necessary. It was Al 
Gore's way of establishing public plausible deniability. He stood above the 
fray, while his cohorts did the dirty work. 

But, more recently, another thought has occurred to me -- a darker, more 
sinister thought. I hope I am wrong. I pray that, this time, I am 
overestimating the deviousness of Al Gore. But that, of course, is always a 
difficult task. 

Think, for a moment, why Al Gore would suddenly be reading and citing the 
Constitution. 

The answer is that, in this instance, it gives him all the power. What do I 
mean? 

Who is it, under the Constitution, that is specifically charged with 
certifying the Electoral College votes of each state? You guessed it. The 
president of the U.S. Senate, which also happens to be the vice president of 
the United States. That's right. The day those Electoral College votes go to 
the Senate to be counted and certified to choose the next president of these 
United States, Al Gore will be holding all the cards. 

"Oh, Farah," you say, "you don't think Al Gore would tamper with the results 
in any way with the whole world watching, do you?" 

Well, let's think about what has been happening in Florida for the last 
several days. Al Gore's campaign managers have been whipping up hysteria 
stating that the will of the people in that state is being subverted. 

They are filing lawsuits. They are organizing marches. They are all but 
accusing the Bush campaign of voter fraud. 

Listen to what Bill Daley has to say: "More than 100 million Americans voted 
on Tuesday and more voted for Al Gore than George Bush. Here in Florida it 
also seems very likely that more voters went to the polls believing that they 
were voting for Al Gore than for George Bush. If the will of the people is to 
prevail Al Gore should be awarded a victory in Florida, and be our next 
president of the United States." 

They've decided that no matter what the actual vote count shows, Gore wins. 

Now, all Gore has to do on that fateful day in the U.S. Senate is reject for 
certification the Electoral College votes of Florida, and he wins the 
majority and becomes president. Sorry, Bush fans. I don't think there's a 
thing you can do about it other than protest, complain and stomp your feet. 
Better start planning your legal strategy now. I'll bet Al Gore's transition 
team is already hard at work. Barbra Streisand is probably making plans to 
sing at the Inauguration. Alec Baldwin is unpacking his bags. This could be a 
fait accompli. I guarantee you a counter to this bold move is not in the Bush 
campaign's playbook. 

The Gore campaign, still working overtime, has laid the groundwork for the 
challenge. The Florida vote is tainted, they say. It's too close to call. Too 
many irregularities. The vote can simply be dismissed by the constitutional 
authority -- Vice President Al Gore. 

Would you put it past him? I sure wouldn't.

Good Morning!
Wanted to see how this quarters earnings report was going to look like.  Many 
of analyst are reporting that its going to be around $.57 for the qtr.  Hope 
you guys beat that estimate.  By the way, how did that deal go that you were 
working on with the company down here?  I saw that Convergent was bought by 
an independent oil and gas company from Houston.  It's up big today.  Hope 
all is going well and that you might give me a call before the end of the 
year.  Thanks!

Work number is 713-853-7998.  How is the fundraising going?  I went to go see 
former President George Bush at a cocktail party/fundraiser the other night.  
We  heard both the former Pres. and Barbara - it was great to hear both of 
them speak.  Talk to you soon.

I talked to Tom Swank this morning on UAE and he feels that we need to have 
Nepco still send out their best EPC number to UAE.  Tom said he can buy some 
time from UAE, so that Nepco can send out the number the middle of next 
week.  I talked to Bruce this morning and he was having Nepco continue to put 
information together on UAE.  Thanks!

Here is a brief list of the projects I have worked on in the first quarter of 
this year.  Just to let you know, I am technically in Mike MIller's IPP 
origination group.  I moved over to this group last week.  I am still going 
perform the same function as I did in CTG, but now from the IPP group.  
Thanks!

Sorry for the delay with the e-mail, I just got back into the office from 
traveling.  We are working hard to sell these assets before year-end - 
they're a beast.  This Friday does not look good for lunch, but I think 
Tuesday or Wednesday of next week works.  I hope this works for you as well.  
Talk to you soon.

I was in your class that you taught for the Princeton Review at Enron just 
recently.  What I'm looking for is a private Math tutor.  I wasn't sure if I 
had to go through the Princeton Review or if I could talk directly to you.  I 
liked the way you taught the class and wanted to see if you taught one on one 
sessions. If you could let me know, I would appreciate it.  Thanks!

Regarding my conversation with John Garrison on the GE 7FA costs.

Delivery:  '00-'01  Cost:  $36.0 MM
Delivery:  '98-'99  Cost:  $34.250 MM
Delivery:  '96-'97  Cost:  $32.0 MM 
Delivery:  '95-'97  Cost:  $30.0 MM

It looks like that for every year and a half the costs go up approx. $2.0 
MM.  The next available order for GE 7FA's is 3rd qtr. 2003.

I thought I sent this earlier, but there are some problems with the system so 
here it is again.  This is the deal sheet for the week of Monday Feb. 14th.  
I will go through it with Ben and show him how to track the deals and update 
the deal sheet on a weekly basis.  If you have any questions, please give me

Subject: Additional information for Rochester

We can respond outside of the formal RFP if we get something to them soon.  
They want to see if we have anything to offer.  In the meantime, they will go 
forward with their RFP.

Do not factor in any cost for the gas pipeline.  The local distribution 
company will absorbe the cost and go at risk for new incremental load.

The cost to go through the LDC is 15 cents/mmbtu on a variable or usage 
basis.  10 cents for transport and 5 cents for service fee.  Peoples gas 
aggregates gas purchases for a number of customers in the region and 
purchases gas month to month.  RPU pays a fixed gas price that changes month 
to month.

We would need to add 15 cents/mmbtu to gas price from our curves.

Substation work should be approximately $5.8MM and no higher than $6mm.

As a point of reference, RPU's estimate for a fully installed LM-2500 is 
$17MM.  They break this out to $11.8MM for turbine and generator, $1.2 MM 
engineering cost, $400k winter package and $3.6MM other stuff.

RPU will have a gas pressure guarantee of 300# so we need to have a 
calculation done on the cost of compression to step up from 300 to 600.  My 
guess is that it will be around $1mm.

I would like to have something to Rochester by mid next week.  We can use the 
routine 2 page proposal format.

The guy you are talking about left CIN under a "cloud of suspicion" sort of 
speak.  He was the one who got into several bad deals and PPA's in California 
for CIN, thus he left on a bad note.  Let me know if you need more detail 
than that, I felt this was the type of info you were looking for.  Thanks!

Quick comments.  Mike, what are your thoughts on my answer in O5?

I'll provide start numbers for O5 later today.

E2.  No; however, CFR60 subpart GG short term limits still apply 
(approximately 90 ppm NOx) which are well above the turbine emissions.

T1.  "on any asset" should read "of any asset"

O5. Since commercial operations, the Wheatland facility has averaged xx 
starts per machine, and the Lincoln facility has averaged yy starts per 
machine.  The start-up and commissioning process followed a normal startup 
progression.  The Lincoln facility experienced a generator failure in unit #7 
during the first run season.  General Electric replaced the generator under 
warranty provisions.  Sratification of gas flows was observed in the stacks 
at the Wheatland facility during CEMS certification.  The CEMS certification 
was then postponed until Summer '01.

O6.  Wasn't it a strip mine?  I didn't think it was a coal mine.

Mitch

We moved the meeting to 12:00 for tomorrow and I am still searching for a 
room, but am willing to do it just up on the floor near Rogers or Curry if 
that is not a problem, because this shouldn't take too long.  Thanks!

I checked with Bernie and there are no reserves left in any of the accounts.  
Edith Cross who worked on the Welded Tube Reg. Risk Account and who sits next 
to Bernie helped verify that there were no reserves left.

To:  Enron North America Corp.

From:  Cliff Baxter and Kevin Hannon


In July, as part of the Enron North America (ENA) reorganization, the=20
implementation of several objectives were highlighted as critical to the=20
continued growth of ENA including: 1) accelerate the development of our=20
people, 2) significantly expand our customer network and associated markets=
,=20
and 3) accelerate and enhance the information flow between groups, both=20
within ENA and across Enron. Consistent with these objectives and with the=
=20
corporate goal of fostering =01&One Enron=018, we would like to announce th=
e=20
following organizational changes in the Coverage/Origination Groups and the=
=20
Commercial Transactions Group within ENA.

1) Coverage/Origination:

To ensure a consistent strategy, the free flowing of resources and product=
=20
technology and the appropriate focus in the midstream and downstream=20
businesses, the following coverage/origination groups will be consolidated=
=20
under the leadership of Dave Delainey :
a) power development solutions for electric and gas utilities, municipals,=
=20
co-ops, energy service companies and IPP=01,s;
b) the Downstream Coverage/Origination groups which focus on delivering a=
=20
broad range of products and services to the heavy industrial customers=20
including  pulp and paper, chemicals, plastics, refined products, metals an=
d=20
mining, heavy manufacturing, industrial gases, fertilizers, transportation,=
=20
textiles and glass manufacturing the Eastern and Western U.S. Midstream=20
Coverage/ Origination groups which focus on energy, finance and industries.

Downstream Coverage/Origination

As energy deregulation continues in North America, it is becoming clear tha=
t=20
the heavy industrial segment will be an important customer market for both=
=20
ENA and Enron Corp.  Further, it is clear that ENA can significantly expand=
=20
its industrial customer network and create more innovative industrial=20
solutions by having a group that can deploy all the capabilities of Enron=
=20
Corp.  Against this backdrop, the Downstream Coverage/Origination function=
=20
will expand its product offering to include not only ENA=01,s existing ener=
gy=20
commodities, energy services, finance, assets and pulp and paper capabiliti=
es=20
but also EES=01,s energy outsourcing capability and Global Fuel=01,s chemic=
als,=20
plastics and refined products risk management capability.  These additional=
=20
capabilities will be offered in conjunction with EES and the Global Fuels=
=20
groups. Given the size and importance of this Enron initiative, Greg Piper=
=20
will be returning from Portland to manage this business. Under Greg=01,s=20
leadership, the Downstream Origination effort will be segmented into three=
=20
sub-groups given the nature of these industries and our product offering:
a) Pulp and Paper =01) Edward Ondarza will continue to manage the coverage=
=20
activities in the Pulp and Paper business. This group will be responsible f=
or=20
the provision of innovative=20
products and services in the pulp and paper industry including the provisio=
n=20
of paper risk management products;
b) Chemicals, Plastics and Refined Products =01) We have asked Jim Ajello t=
o=20
lead the coverage activities in this business.  This group will be=20
responsible for the provision of innovative products and services in the=20
chemicals and refined products industries;
c) Non-Integrated Industrials =01) Bruce Garner, formerly leader of Bankers=
=20
Trust=01,s global metals and mining group in London, has joined ENA to lead=
 the=20
coverage activities in this business.  This group will be responsible for t=
he=20
provision of innovative products and services for the metals and mining,=20
heavy manufacturing, industrial gases, fertilizers, transportation, textile=
s=20
and glass manufacturing industries.




Midstream Coverage/Origination

a) Eastern Coverage/Origination =01) This group=01, activities will focus o=
n=20
energy, finance and power development solutions for electric and gas=20
utilities, municipals, co-ops and energy service companies in the Eastern=
=20
Interconnect. We have asked  Janet Dietrich to assume the leadership of thi=
s=20
group;
b) Western Coverage/Origination =01) This group=01,s activities will focus =
on=20
energy, finance and power development solutions for electric and gas=20
utilities, municipals, co-ops and energy service companies in the WSCC. The=
y=20
will also continue to manage all Qualified Facilities (QF) restructuring=20
opportunities in the Western U.S.  We have asked Chris Calger to assume the=
=20
leadership of this coverage group. Chris will relocate to Portland from=20
Calgary where he currently leads the Canadian downstream origination effort=
s;
c) IPP Merchant Coverage/Origination =01) This group=01,s activities will f=
ocus on=20
the provision of structured energy, finance and asset solutions for the=20
emerging merchant power generators who control large portfolio=01,s of merc=
hant=20
power generation either through development or acquisition. We have asked =
=20
Mike Miller to assume the leadership of this group.  In addition, Mike will=
=20
continue to manage the power development activities in the Eastern=20
Interconnect;
d) Eastern QF Restructuring =01) This group will focus on the QF restructur=
ing=20
opportunities in the Eastern Interconnect including the existing=20
restructuring and re-capitalization of the East Coast Power assets.  We hav=
e=20
asked Dave Duran to assume the leadership of this business. Greg Blair,=20
formerly of Enron Asia=01,s development group, Doug Clifford, formerly of=
=20
Citizens power, and Dick Lydecker, formerly of Cogen Technology, will join=
=20
this newly formed business.

2) Commercial Transactions:=20

The Commercial Transactions Group (CTG), co-headed by Ray Bowen and Jeff=20
Donahue, was formed to provide a centralized resource for the execution of=
=20
transactions within ENA =01) and thereby, improve ENA=01,s efficiency in ex=
ecuting=20
transactions and free-up the origination groups to increase their intensity=
=20
of client coverage.  CTG consists of six primary functions: Transaction=20
Development, Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management, Commodity=20
Structuring and Transportation, Transactional Support/Accounting, Technical=
=20
Analysis and Upstream Asset Management.

The Transaction Development Group will be responsible for deal leadership,=
=20
execution and optimization of all aspects of a transaction in conjunction=
=20
with the originator. The function will be divided into four teams, each of=
=20
which will be dedicated to between two and four origination groups.  This=
=20
dedication to specific groups should provide a closer link, better service=
=20
and greater accountability with the origination groups; however, the CTG=20
resources are designed to be a fungible and flexible resource allocated to=
=20
the highest value transactions across the coverage functions:

a) Midstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Eastern and=
=20
Western Coverage/Origination Groups.  The senior members of this group=20
include Billy Lemmons, George McCormick, Erin Norris and Russ Porter. Billy=
=20
Lemmons joined Enron in 1992.  Most recently, he was the Vice-President of=
=20
Capital Structuring and Risk Management for EES. Russ Porter joins us today=
=20
from Dynegy where he was a manager with responsibilities for power=20
origination.
b) Downstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to ENA=01,s industr=
ial=20
origination efforts in Pulp and Paper, Petrochemicals and Refining,=20
Environmental Energy, Metals and Mining and other industries as coverage is=
=20
established.  The senior members of this team include Rodney Malcolm, Jay=
=20
Boudreaux, Finley Biggerstaff and Chris Helfrich.  We anticipate announcing=
=20
two to four more additions to this team within the next few weeks.
c) Generation Transaction Development will be dedicated to the IPP Merchant=
=20
Services and power plant development and QF Restructuring groups.  The seni=
or=20
members of this team include Thomas Suffield, Andy Kelemen, Kelly Mahmoud a=
nd=20
John House. Thomas Suffield joined Enron in 1996. Most recently, he was the=
=20
Vice-President of Origination for the Latin American group in Azurix.  We=
=20
anticipate announcing two more additions to this team within the next few=
=20
weeks.
d) Upstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Producer=20
Finance, Coal and Gas Assets groups.  The senior members of this team inclu=
de=20
Brad Dunn, John Curtin and Chris Hilgert.  We hope to announce the addition=
=20
of at least one VP to this group prior to yearend.

Ray Bowen will have primary oversight responsibilities for the Upstream and=
=20
Downstream Transaction Development teams with Jeff Donahue having primary=
=20
responsibilities for the Midstream and Generation teams.  Andrea Reed will=
=20
continue to head Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management: all junior=
=20
commercial resources within the Transaction Development teams will have dua=
l=20
responsibilities to both their Transaction Development teams and to the=20
Capital Structuring Group.  The remaining four groups within CTG will remai=
n=20
largely unchanged.  In addition, the Origination and the Transaction=20
Development teams and their respective origination groups will be located=
=20
together.

We believe that these changes will significantly enhance our market coverag=
e=20
and industry knowledge in all ENA=01,s markets particularly in the industri=
al=20
markets. It will also provide a closer partnership and accountability betwe=
en=20
the Coverage/Origination Groups and the CTG Groups.=20

Please help us in continuing to build on the success we have enjoyed in Nor=
th=20
America by working with us to implement these changes.

Dr. Harris:
 In my pursuit to strengthen my application profile for next year I have 
explored taking two graduate level night courses this summer and I wanted to 
know what courses the admissions committee would suggest that I take this 
summer.  I wanted to make sure that I was taking the courses that were most 
appropriate with regards to my application. Just to let you know, I was 
planning on taking two finance courses.  Thanks in advance for your 
suggestion with this matter.  
 I was in Austin yesterday for the completion of the MS 150 Bike ride, but 
was not able to stick around.  Hope all is going well and hope to hear from 
you soon.  

Regards,
Ben Rogers
