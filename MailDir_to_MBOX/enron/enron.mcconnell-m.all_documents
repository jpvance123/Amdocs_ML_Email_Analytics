Most of you are familiar with the Impact & Influence program that has been a 
requirement for VP's for the last several years.  This training has been now 
been modified for Manager and Director level employees who directly manage 
and lead teams.

We have many new Managers and Directors in EGM who could benefit from this 
training.  If you have someone that you would like to nominate for the 
program, please respond to me immediately.

Thanks,
Shanna

Jeff,

Good to see you in New York last week at the Guggenheim -- I enjoyed your 
company at the dinner.  Lisa Yoho passed on your questions about the Bush 
Energy Plan and opportunities for EGM, so I thought I'd outline a few from 
Lisa Jacobson's and my perspective.  Many of the recommendations in the 
Energy Plan are very broad and could take months (if not years) to approve.  
However, there are certainly a few areas where EGM could find more immediate 
opportunity, or where we could weigh in to make the longer-term components of 
the plan beneficial to Enron.
 
Short-term opportunities

$2 billion over ten years for Clean Coal Technologies:  There may be 
opportunities to pursue R&D funding, pilot projects, or tax incentives for 
technologies such as NOx Tech.  While the bulk of this money could take 
several years to approve, there is "clean coal" program money available now 
for FY 2002, and DOE is already structuring programs for 2003 money.   I have 
already discussed this briefly with the Clean Energy Solutions folks, but we 
have good contacts at DOE and they are very anxious to work with Enron, as 
they see us as a company who can help make the most of their R&D money 
because we are serious about moving technologies to market.   

Climate Change R&D:  Any financial support the government puts toward climate 
change R&D could likely also be utilized for new generation/control 
technologies, but this would be a longer-term opportunity.

New Source Review (NSR) Reforms -  NSR has been an obstacle to constructing 
new generation, but also a huge thorn in the side of big coal-using utilities 
who would like to make modifications to keep grandfathered plants alive as 
long as possible.  The Clinton/Browner EPA brought major enforcement lawsuits 
against a number (Southern, TVA, AEP, Cinergy) and a few have settled 
(Cinergy, TECO). The Bush Energy Plan asks the EPA and Justice Dept. to look 
at 1) possible changes to the NSR enforcement lawsuits and 2) longer term 
changes to NSR regulation -- all in the name of bringing more energy supply 
on line.  The utilities are mounting very aggressive lobbying efforts to 
change NSR.

A DOJ decision on the enforcement could be forthcoming in the short term 
(summer 2001).  In the big picture for Enron, letting the big, coal-using 
utilities off the hook would not be the best outcome -- enforcement relief 
only holds benefits for the incumbents and not new entrants in the power 
development market.   But if it happens, we'll make sure the EGM folks have 
good advance warning so that they can take advantage of any coal trading or 
technology plays that they might find as a result from these utilities moving 
forward with plant modifications or capacity increases.

Any NSR regulatory changes will be fought over the longer-term (with 
resistance from environmentalists), and could also likely be addressed in the 
multipollutant debate -- see below.

Long Term Opportunities/Advocacy

Multipollutant legislation -  A regulatory program that all at once 
streamlines regulation of NOx, SO2 and mercury as well as provides relief 
from NSR requirements could be extremely beneficial for EGM's emissions 
trading and technology businesses (as well as a number of other Enron 
businesses).   Nationwide trading for these pollutants would open up markets 
and create liquidity far beyond the current programs.   Regulatory certainly 
for generators seeking to upgrade, expand and improve efficiency at power 
plants could provide incentives for technology and risk management services.

Our Environmental Strategies group has developed a multipollutant plan that 
achieves a number of goals for Enron, including nationwide cap-and-trade for 
3 (or even 4, if CO2 is included) pollutants in a way that provides 
incentives for new technologies, promotes fuel diversity, and has economic 
safeguards in place.   We've structured it to have multiple benefits to 
Enron, and we are working on getting key Administration and congressional 
officials to adopt our ideas.   We're making progress, but expect this debate 
to go on for at least a few years.

Here are some excerpts from recent slides summarizing our plan, if you're 
interested.



Please let us know if you have any questions - we are happy to work with you 
and anyone in EGM to take advantage of opportunities in these environmental 
proposals.

FYI---this project is heating up rapidly and may be quite attractive.  I had 
separate talks inLondon on Friday last week to explore turning this into a 
regional development project in the Aqaba/Eilat area at the tip of the red 
sea (where Egypt, Israel, Jordan and Saudi all meet and where a regional 
planning authority is in place).  There may be a good opportunity for a 
regional power and district cooling plant with energy management and 
gas/power marketing opportunities.

Will advise after Rob's meeting s in Cairo/Amman and after we scrub this at 
our Dubai planning meeting this week

Charles,

Further to my last email my thoughts on the competing schemes are as
follows;

I reviewed the subject of your email from the angle of competing schemes and
the advise I received is that the whole project should be presented and
dealt with as an "area" project serving several countries inclusive of
Jordan (ie. the hub approach). It is very important that it is promoted this
way or there might be a big risk of leaving the image or consideration that
this is just purely a Jordanian project without a broader scope.

Regards,
Hamdi

Fellows,

I had a number of interesting sessions today on Amman on the subject of
Egypt gas. IN summary:

- The Prime mInister and Oil Minister are open to discuss this project,
in the context of clear future needs, estimated at 400 BCF by 2005. As a
matter of fact, the Oil Minister - Wa'el Sabri - brought in his senior
team to the meeting and scheduled a working session with Enron for
September 27, at 10:00 AM

- In addition, the Royal Court (Diwan) support this development and has
sent to the meetings Dr. Bassem Awadallah, the Economic Advisor to King
Abdullah

- The Amoco deal is dead: they had an axclusivity arrangement which
ended recently and they had in mind a pricing scheme linked to the "fuel
being used currently" or to oil prices, both of which were totally
unacceptable to JOrdan

- Whatever deal there is will need to compete against the odds that the
deal with Irak, which provides Jordan with virtually "free" oil, will
keep as it is. In fact, it is this deal which has allowed the Government
to procrastinate on the AMOCO discussions

- Jordan is comfortable that there is gas in Risha, close to the Irak
border. Schlumberger are currently exploring in that region. The thing
is that the government is convinced that whatever gas they may find in
Risha should not prevent them fromstriking a deal for an import scheme

- The government has been approached by the Saleh Kamel group of saudi
arabia, which believes thay may be able to set up a new company which
will develop gas fields in the northwestern part of saudi (Tabouk) and
export it to Jordan. This is still at a very preliminary stage, but
appears to be of great interest to the jordanians

- IN addition, British Gas approached the minister with a new scheme,
relying on gas discovered "off the coast of Gaza and Israel, which will
require a shorter pipeline. the thing is that the Jordanians feel
uncomfortable with imports through Israel at this stage of the "peace
process"!

So here we are, welcome to pitch into this situation. I used the
argument of speed of development and this is something we need to check
with the Egyptians.

The course of action is as follows:

1. ENRON is to issue a letter to the Jordan Energy Minister (ASAP)
stating the opportunity and formally requesting discussions. No
MIDDLEMAN PLEASE...THIS WAS CLEARLY STATED BY THE PM and the Minister!.
The address is:
H.E. Eng. WA'EL SABRI
Minister of Energy & Mineral Resources
P.O.Box 140027, Amman, Jordan
Fax No. 9626 586 5373
Phone No. 9626 581 1338

A fax will do, as far as the minister is concerned.

2. A meeting has been scheduled on september 27, at 10:00 AM in the
Minister's office. it is likely to be attended by Ahmad Bashir,
secretary General of the Ministry and Rashad Aburas, Advisor to the
Minister (National Electric Power Co.), plus some other people

3. Based on the demand projections and timing, the jordanians expect
some kind of a formal proposal. time of important, as other competing
schemes may have political or technical delays

Fellows, the Jordanians are supportive of the scheme and its sponsors,
so we need to capitalize on this.

In line with my phone discussions with Rob, I will try to rearrange the
meeting for monday sept. 25 and, if possible, our meeting in Cairo for
sunday sept. 24.

I will keep you posted. Any thoughts on the competing schemes are most
welcome.

Charles

Ken,

You might point out to McConnell that there is a strong correlation between
OU's football success and the price of a barrel of oil.  Talk about the best
team money can buy!

Also, if Mike has any friends coming from the East Coast to visit him in
Oklahoma tell him to send them these directions:

1)  Head West until you smell sh_t--you have made it to Texas,

2)  Head North until you step in it--you are now in Oklahoma!

OK.  But at least we have upside.   The ability to count past 7 exceeds the
limit  of most OU students, alums, football players and coaches thereby
either
capping the number of national championships you can talk about at 7.
Alternatively, OU would have to increase academic standards to enable them
to
count beyond the 7 national championships.  Unfortunately, we already know
that
actually winning a national championship with athletes possesing an IQ above

Ken,

I had to respond.

Speaking of bitch....all of the Cornhusker fans are bitching about Stoops
not
taking the head coach position at the Cleveland Browns or any other job that
will get him out of their backyard.  By the way, Stoops just started working
on
his book "OU's 7th Football National Championship"; Chapter 3, Who are the

I see that we are scheduled to have lunch today.   I may have to postpone
again,
I'll let you know later this morning.  I am out all weekend and we have to
have
the final comments on the Analyst Presentation in by sunday night so I may
be
working over lunch.  Actually, I think we are in pretty good shape so I will
probably be doing lunch but just don't be too mad if I have to cancel.

Ken

PS  Your brother told me he went to 3 bowl games (when I found out that two
of
them were the galleryfurniture.com bowl and that one in Shreveport (I can't
remember the name of it)) I realized he is a very, very sick college
football
fan.

Mike,

Thanks for the quick follow-up. My background is in the sales, marketing, 
strategic planning and M&A areas in the industrial sector. Do not know if 
there is a fit, but I had hoped to explore possibilities with you.

All, 

After filling out and gathering all the feedback forms in the last couple of 
weeks, Jeff and I just realized that we forgot to ask everyone for an 
accomplishment list from each of you.  We have had a very successful 2001 so 
far and we need to be able to discuss each group and your personal mid-year 
in detail.  Please send us an email with your accomplishments so that we have 
all the facts during the PRC process.  

This doesn't need to be formal but simply put together and email to both of 
us for the appropriate time.

Thanks,
Mike and Jeff

impression is that the rules are not nearly as far advanced as the article

EGYPT:
Egypt agrees to reduce natural gas price.

09/18/2000
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2000.

CAIRO, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Egypt's Oil Minister Sameh Fahmy said on Monday the
ministry had agreed with international companies to reduce the price of
natural gas produced locally.

He told reporters after a cabinet meeting that approved the agreement that it
would be submitted to parliament, which opens a new session on December 13
after general elections.
Fahmy said the new gas pricing deal, which cuts the price Egypt pays to
foreign companies for their share of gas produced in the country, would save
the government $250 million a year.

He gave no details of the pricing structure, but said it would take effect
from July, 2000, apparently referring to the start of Egypt's fiscal year
(July-June).

The cabinet also approved plans to export natural gas and liquefied natural
gas (LNG) to Turkey and Europe, he said.

Information Minister Safwat el-Sherif said Egypt would earn an initial $265
million a year from exporting gas by pipeline and about $280 million a year
from LNG exports.

In July, Spanish electricity generator Union Fenosa signed a long-term gas
contract with the state Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation to buy 40
billion therms of gas a year.

Spain's third biggest power utility is to receive the gas by pipeline. It said
it had also agreed to invest $1 billion to build a liquefaction plant in Egypt
by 2004.

In June BP-Amoco announced plans to develop an LNG plant to process and ship
LNG to Mediterranean and other markets. BG International said in April it had
agreed with EGPC and Italy's Edison International to build an LNG plant for
export to unspecified buyers in the Mediterranean region.

East Mediterranean Gas, a joint venture of EGPC, Israel's Merhav Group, said
in May it had begun talks with the Israel Electric Corp for laying an
underwater pipeline to supply Egyptian gas to Israel.

It said it planned to build a 780-km (468-mile) pipeline able to carry up to
15 billion cubic metres of gas a year from Egypt to Turkey, with exits to
Israel.

Egypt puts its proven reserves of natural gas at 42.5 trillion cubic feet and
total reserves at around 120 trillion.

Subject: Weather deals



As discussed with Mark, I have set up a summary of what we did to get people 
interested in weather trading at the Marketing event that we had here in Oslo.


Background:
First we wanted to do something new that would promote Enron positively. 
(There are a lot of conferences with happenings for power traders)
Most of the participants were traders or very interested in trading.
Could we do any deals that evening? We invited them because they should start 
doing deals with Enron.
Several of the companies attending needed to change their risk policy to do 
weather deals.

Lottery:
We made a lottery that was similar to a weather deal. But we made the option 
premium to 15,-  Nok and max payment if the option stroked to 100,- NOK. Our 
counterparties should not loose a lot of money, so they paid the premium 
upfront and they was not allowed to sell any options. 
The counter parties, that were the traders and not the companies, did their 
first weather deals with Enron.  It was important that the traders could go 
short or long or both. (Buy both put and call, for the traders that was 
afraid of their possitions) Some bought 10 contracts and they really felt 
that they traded weather deals. 

The most positive in my opinion was that over 20 companies have traders that 
have done weather deals already.

Subject: MTBE legislation

Today, Senators Bob Smith (R-NH) and Harry Reid (D-NV) will introduce an MTBE 
bill. which is expected to be slightly different than we've seen in previous 
Congresses.  

We expect it to include:  

1) a 4-year date certain to eliminate MTBE, with EPA determining the phaseout 
schedule
2)  a lifting of the 2% oxygenate standard upon perfunctory petition by State 
governors within 90 days from date of enactment
3)  and environmental "anti-backsliding" provision focused only on air-toxics 
and using a 2000 baseline with a 27.5% percent standard (the way I understand 
it right now, RFG must perform 27.5% better than 2000 baseline for 
conventional gasoline)
4) provisions for MTBE producer "transition assistance"

Brief analysis:  

We'll have more details shortly, but the bill looks a little better than 
previous efforts.  A number of bills have been introduced this Congress, but 
this will probably be the leading effort.  

As you know, Enron has led efforts to include the "transition assistance" 
piece -- which is still largely undefined in the legislation -- but we are 
pleased with the inclusion of a "placeholder" while the Senate decides on the 
best approach.  We will continue to lead the development of such incentives 
(which will likely take the form of EPA/DOE funding for MTBE producers who 
convert plants to produce iso-octane or alkylate).

An MTBE ban is of course not good, but a "date certain" gives producers more 
flexibility to determine their options rather than reduce production under 
several steps of a phase out.   Allowing states to get a waiver of the oxy 
standard is probably a given in any legislation, but will face some 
opposition from the ethanol community -- who just want a simple MTBE ban.

The anti-backsliding provision is still being refined, but looks fairly 
lame.  We need more details to make an accurate assessment, but its likely 
that environmental groups will want a bit more.

One political factor -- with Sen. Jim Jeffords leaving the Republican party, 
Democrats will be given control of the Senate Environment Committee, which 
will consider this bill.  They will likely allow Jeffords to chair the 
committee.  The significance is that Sen. Bob Smith (R-NH) is the current 
chair, and has been able to use that position to drive his past bills on MTBE 
-- in losing the chairmanship, his legislation may face a longer road through 
Committee.

I will keep you posted as the legislation evolves.

Mike,

It is my understanding that the office of the chairman will be distributing 
the attached memorandum to all employees on June 7.  Furthermore, it appears 
that the policy committee recommended that business unit heads send e-mails 
to their staffs, echoing and supporting these recommendations.  We would be 
pleased to prepare a draft for your consideration, if you would like to send 
out such an e-mail to the EGM staff.

John

Mike,

Please see the attached POA authorizing you and Rick Bergsieker to execute 
the referenced agreement and related documents.  The timing of execution of 
these documents is unclear at this time.  This matter has been pending for 
about 5 months as full agreement has not been reached with PDVSA, I believe. 

Please note that I will need your passport number to include in the POA, as 
this is required by Venezuela law.  Thank you.

Rick,

Nancy Corbet has advised that the timing for the execution of the referenced 
document is unclear; however, a POA was prepared in April of this year, 
authorizing Frank Stabler, David Haug, and Doug Rotenberg as 
attorneys-in-fact to execute this and other related "transaction documents."

We should replace Frank and Doug.  Nancy has suggested that you could be 
named to replace one of them.  Is this okay with you?  Should David be 
retained?  Who else do you recommend naming as the third 
signatory/attorney-in-fact?

Please advise.

fyi--per our discussion about Lotus Notes and how to use the Out of Office 
feature when you are traveling.

Click on the Actions icon at the top of the page and a list will appear. 
Scroll down to Mail Tools which will bring up another list. Then scroll down 
to the last item which is Out of Office. This will lead you to a page which 
will allow you to put in your departure and return dates and any message you 
wish to send to anyone that emails you during your absence. When you return 
you simply go to the Out of Office page and disable the message. For 
subsequent use you just plug in your new travel dates.

Yesterday afternoon we filed an intervention on behalf of Enron in regard to 
SLNG's current FERC application to amend the original FERC certificate at 
Elba Island.  The application is to changeout the existing vaporizers at the 
terminal and to install blending facilities to deal with higher heat value 
LNG coming in to the terminal.

Our intervention gave general support to the filing but reserved the right to 
comment at a later time after further analysis of the impact of introducing 
high heat value LNG into the downstream pipelines had been completed.

The intervention has been fully reviewed by Shelley Corman and we believe, as 
a result, the tone of the document is not adversarial.  Further to this, we 
discussed the intervention with SLNG's FERC staff, and after incorporating a 
few minor changes they requested, confirmed with them that they had no strong 
objections to the filing.

A copy of the document filed at FERC is attached below.

If you have any questions please give me a call (x56249).

Thank you

I think we have a way to go on the Weather Front (notice my use of the=20
appropriate anologies) in Europe but I have major concerns about
the communication level from Houston to Oslo - even now.  I just don't see=
=20
enough hugs and kisses (from Houston) to cross the cultural divide.  So let=

please have a conversation on this before proceeding.

John,

We had a successful off-site in Miami this weekend.  We reviewed all of the=
=20
EGM businesses and our goals and objectives for 2001.  I will send you a co=
py=20
of the presentations for your information and review - good airplane readin=
g.=20

 I have had several additional discussions on our Global weather business a=
nd=20
have come to a decision on how we need to run the weather business.   I=20
believe that we do need 100% full time dedication from each and any employe=
e=20
that is dedicated to the weather business including in the overall=20
development and execution of our global strategy and positions.   I have a=
=20
great deal of confidence and am holding Mark Tawney responsible and=20
accountable for extensive growth and profitability in the business on a=20
global basis.

We need to hire additional people to add to grow the business in Japan and=
=20
Australia.  Joe and Paul are on board with this strategy and Mark will work=
=20
with them to accomplish the hiring of people and needed resources.  This wi=
ll=20
not just be talk but we will get these people in place by specific=20
deadlines.  We will pay all of those people's expenses and of course the=20
business leaders will be on board with the hiring and the weather guys will=
=20
be expected to be a valuable team player and resource to their group.

On the Norway front, we need to implement the same organization structure. =
=20
We have talked a lot about Thor and better communication, but we need to ma=
ke=20
a change.  On the communication front, we will have weekly calls with him a=
nd=20
the weather group to make sure that we are all on the same page and he is u=
p=20
to speed with where we are going.  If I am in town, I=01,ll make those call=
s as=20
well.   Jeff did have a video call with Thor last week to talk about his=20
email and it went well.  Upon my return from London, I learned that Thor an=
d=20
the London group put out a press release about putting out pricing on about=
=20
1,000 new products on 15 cities and even changing the index.  Neither Mark=
=20
nor Jeff were even aware of this event nor was it even brought up in the ca=
ll=20
as something that was going to happen.  Also the hiring of Lars Elmlund as =
a=20
weather  originator, without any discussion, also illustrates the lack of=
=20
communication or desire to work together.  I am not saying that Mark or Tho=
r=20
are totally to blame, they both deserve credit for not working together, bu=
t =20
we are going to change the future and make sure that it will work better.  =
I=20
know that all of Thor's group is very loyal to Thor and the weather guys ma=
y=20
not want to transition into EGM.  If that is the case, we can make it work=
=20
via London.  I think the key is our approach to Thor and that this isn't=20
meant as a reflection on him but is a change that is consistent with how we=
=20
are running all of our EGM businesses around the world.  The specific weath=
er=20
piece of his business is very small and isn't going to effect his P&L=20
significantly (he'll actually be net positive!).

I certainly want to do this with the least impact on the rest of your=20
organization.  Please give me a call and we will discuss the issues=20
surrounding this new structure and the best way to communicate it to those=
=20
involved in order to implement this in the most effective manner.

I am unavailable (London time) on Monday and Tuesday but will make myself=
=20
available to your schedule upon my return after that.

Thanks,
mike

PS - This email is going just to you and Jeff and won't be shared with anyo=
ne=20
else.

Joe, 

Attached below is a draft of an EGM update and org announcement.  It will be 
broad in scope and will address many areas.  Please review and provide 
comments especially on the Japan part.  I went ahead and took a stab at the 
first cut here and expect you to make all the changes and emphasis you feel 
is appropriate.  We are a couple of weeks away from discussing every player 
(Morten Erik) that is why I left it very broad.  Please take a moment, change 
and send back to me for examination and incorporation.

I wanted to get this out on Friday, but may have to wait until early next 
week while i am on the road.

Thanks,
Mike

PB,

Attached is a resume for a guy I know via technology and a very old parental 
friendship.  He is a very aggressive guy and marketer type.  He has the 
personality to be an originator or mid-marketer.  I figured you might need 
someone like this around for Paveto,  Bruce's or in EOL group.   He would 
pound the phones and make things happen.

Follow up if you want to talk with him.

Thanks,
m

Subject: Origination Opportunities in Global Markets


Hello Mike,

It has been a while since my last communication with you. I hope all is well.

I want you to know that I greatly appreciated you helping me get in touch 
with Ken Rice and all of the other folks at EBS last year. We made great 
strides and came very close to doing a deal between our organizations. 
However, Comdisco recently has come under some financial duress and is most 
likely going to be sold off in pieces.

I have been talking with some of the folks within EBS about the possibility 
of an origination position with their group. However, I am of the opinion 
that EBS is slightly ahead of the market, and therefore the timing may not be 
right for me to consider an origination position with EBS.

With that being said, I would be very interested in exploring what 
opportunities might exist within your Global Markets group from an 
origination standpoint. As you know, I am professionally aggressive, mentally 
tough and fearless of contacting potential clients. I have solid experience 
in professional selling, possess excellent communication and entrepreneurial 
skills.

Mike please consider the attached resume below. I would welcome the 
opportunity to meet with you or the appropriate person within your 
organization at any time.

Thanks again, and I hope to hear from you.

Hi Mike,

Amanda Martin asked that I forward my resume to you for your consideration.  
I am interested in a position in origination, risk management or structuring 
within Enron.  I graduated from Rice University and Stanford University in 
engineering and have advanced into a commercial role at Azurix.  I am hoping 
to build on my commercial skills at Enron Global Markets.

I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss my plans with you.  I am 
available to meet at your convenience.  You may reach me at 713-646-7902.  
Amanda will also follow up with a telephone call to you next week.

Thank you for your help.

Randy,

Thanks for the email.  Yes,  life is wild at Enronville.  It was a very 
difficult decision to leave this group but I am enjoying my first week.

I keep up via old channels with your company.  I am so glad that it all 
worked out and I know you will have continued success.

I'll give you a call when things settle down.  I hope all is well with you 
and your family.

Subject: JDF Update

Sunday, November 5th, is the big day.  Although we have less than two weeks 
left, we still have several exciting fundraising activities taking place.  
All walkers should continue getting pledges and watch for further 
instructions on turning in the walk forms.  Everyone has done an incredible 
job this year.  Great news, we are getting very close to reaching our goal, 
but if we want to continue to be the number one walk team in Houston, we need 
to continue with our fundraising efforts.  Please plan to join us for the 
following activities this week:
 
Silent/Cyber Auction - The JDF Silent Cyber Auction will open for bids on 
Wednesday, October 25th, at 8:00 a.m. and will close on Thursday, October 
26th, at 4:00 p.m.  You may access the Cyber Auction to place your bids at 
8:00 a.m. on Wednesday, October 25th, by launching the website at 
http://ecinside.enron.net/apps/jdf.nsf  or go to the Enron home page on the 
Intranet and click on the JDF Cyber Auction.  For more information, contact 
Sophie Patel at ext. 35055 or Eddie Sera at ext. 30480.  

Bake Sale and Raffles - Just in time for the Holidays!  On Friday, October 
27th, we will have several groups selling delicious baked goods on the second 
floor level of the Enron Building outside the Energizer.  In addition, we 
will have representatives from some of our walk teams available for the 
purchase of raffle tickets at the same location.

For all that are not signed up, please join us in the walk.  You still have 
time.  It will take 2 minutes to fill out a walk form, you get a great 
Enron/JDF T-shirt for collecting or donating $25 or more, and will join 
hundreds of Enron employees and approximately 10,000 Houstonians for the walk 
on Sunday, November 5th, at the Sam Houston Race Park.  I promise this will 
be a blast.  The Enron tent will be great again this year!  We will begin 
with a continental breakfast prior to the walk and when everyone returns from 
the walk we will have music, balloons for the children and wonderful Frankie 
Mandola's hamburgers, hot dogs and fries.  Parking at the Sam Houston Race 
Park is free.  You will be part of something very worthwhile and it will make 
you feel great.  This is a world class event.

Please contact any of the following Steering Committee members to make a 
donation, sign up as a walker, or ask any questions you may have.  Come join 
the fun.

Hi Charlene -

Is this a different reception from the one we have on Mike McConnell's 
calendar for January 16th?  Unfortunately, Mike will be at an off-site 
meeting on the 11th and I do not know if he can make it back in time for a 
4:30 reception.

Thanks.

Dear OU Team:

We are in a critical time in the recruiting process as offers have been 
extended.  In order to ensure our cultivation efforts I have assigned each of 
you to one or more candidates to contact weekly, beginning this week.  

By taking "ownership" you will create a more personal relationship with your 
candidate(s) and help us to stay abreast of any questions or concerns they 
may have.

Please keep me posted regarding these cultivation efforts so that no one is 
left out.

Thanks again for all your work and participation!  

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Rebecca,,

Attached, for your information, is  a copy of a general presentation that I 
prepared to illustrate and describe EGM's businesses.  This is a presentation 
that will become a "living" document to communicate our businesses and 
growth.  I will be making numerous changes as we move closer to the analyst 
meeting in January but I wanted to give everyone a copy of this version.

Please don't hesitate to call me if you have any questions or comments.

Mike

Jeff,

Sorry, I can't participate on Saturday.  I have serious commitments that I 
can't break specifically on Saturday.  I know that we are short people and I

Per,

Attached is the first draft of an EGM update and org memo.  Please take a few 
minutes and review, add what is necessary for your section and return ASAP.   
Other comments are welcome as well.    I would like to get this at on Friday 
evening or early next week.   Please do so on a hard copy and have brought 
up.  I will incorporate your changes. Some of the changes in the memo are 
still under consideration and need to be considered extremely confidential.  
This needs a lot of work and filler.  Also add a one line update or positive 
statement about your business as an intro line of the section.   

Thanks,
mike

I would suggest we avoid getting involved in any acquisition effort at 
present, although it would be worth establishing avaluation for the storage 
and the brand.  All our experience so far with Spanish law suggests due 
diligence shouldn't be undertaken unless we are serious, and that it  will be 
impossible to transact in less than  3 months if that.   

Regards,

Tani

All, 

After filling out and gathering all the feedback forms in the last couple of 
weeks, Jeff and I just realized that we forgot to ask everyone for an 
accomplishment list from each of you.  We have had a very successful 2001 so 
far and we need to be able to discuss each group and your personal mid-year 
in detail.  Please send us an email with your accomplishments so that we have 
all the facts during the PRC process.  

This doesn't need to be formal but simply put together and email to both of 
us for the appropriate time.

Thanks,
Mike and Jeff

Jonny,

Wow what a week.  I still can't believe it.  I will have the video in mail 
overnight on Monday.  Sorry for the delay.  Let me know if you got another 
copy and don't need it.

Thanks again for the tickets and for driving.  It was fun being with Trey.  I 
hope B is feeling better and that you had a great time celebrating Madeline's 
birthday.  I can't believe you have a teenager.  We are getting old.

I was showing my ticket off this morning to everyone and someone mentioned 
the price of the ticket.  $175!  I didn't realize that when you gave it to 
me.  I really don't want your dad picking that up for the two of us.  I 
didn't mind his hospitality at $50 bucks but i simply didn't realize they 
were that much -  I 've never been to the big dance before.  If your dad 
wasn't comped the tickets from OU, Mark and I would like to reimburse him.

Please let me know the situation.

Cheers and Boomer Sooner,
mike

Steve,

Attached, for your information, is  a copy of a general presentation that I 
prepared to illustrate and describe EGM's businesses.  This is a presentation 
that will become a "living" document to communicate our businesses and 
growth.  I will be making numerous changes as we move closer to the analyst 
meeting in January but I wanted to give everyone a copy of this version.

Please don't hesitate to call me if you have any questions or comments.

Mike

Jay/Allan,

FYI and evaluation, attached is a business plan from the CALME group.  Please 
let me know what you think.  They are trying to play ball and sent this to 
us.  Also they are beginning to call me.  

I had planned to send this to you while I was out but it wouldn't go thru 
properly from San Francisco.  Allan, please give her a call and let her know 
you received it and let her know your overall impression.

By the way, Karen is David Haug's new fiancee.

Thanks,
Mike

As per David's request and our discussion on Friday evening, please take a

you would like to pursue it so that I can facilitate an introduction if it is

This came through to me through some contacts in the DR. I am not sure if you 
would be interested in seeing if the model applies in any other countries in 
your region. Additionally, who is the person who would be a counterpart for 
the Southern Cone. Let me know if it tickles you as I need to get back to

Michael, I have the following comments to the Nodocero.com project.

Currently works as a platform where buyers and sellers agree on a price 
through an auction process (brokerage fee)
They aim at becoming a regulated market with standardised contracts. (subject 
to market and regulatory evolution)
Their value drivers are the "Payment Guarantee" (through an insurance 
company) and "Backoffice" (registration before regulatory authorities). None 
of these issues are definitely solved (no agreement with Insurance Co. and if 
any transaction is done now, all the backoffice procedures have to be done 
manually with their employees).
No technological partner yet. They have developed the web site platform (you 
can see it at www.nodocero.com), but I understand that they don't have the 
rest of the technological components required (database, operations, clearing 
system, other). 

Apart from this, I would consider the following issues:

Currently there is no regulated market for this sector of the economy 
(Argentina and the rest of Latin America). Therefore their idea of becoming 
one is good.
The competitors in this race are: Nodocero.com - aXesoEnergia.com - 
EnergyVex.com - Rofex (Rosario Futures Exchange) - other.
No competitor has yet taken an important lead in this race. aXesoEnergia.com 
is doing an important investment in marketing, but it currently works via an 
auction process and does not provide any further service like guarantee or 
backoffice.
One of the competitors will eventually succeed in becoming the reference 
market.
Nodocero.com has no strategic partner yet. (this could be taken as positive 
or negative)

The attached file is their business plan


Patrick

I have attached a spreadsheet which contains graphs reflecting the following

Unfortunately, I do not have any recruiting numbers reflecting back before I

I will be happy to meet with you to provide further explanation and to

In reviewing the contracts, so far I have the following questions:

1.     Have Oman LNG and ADgas taken the risk of non-performance by DPC and 
indirectly MSEB without any credit support?  The only security is the equity 
in DPC?  Are such contracts typically secured or done with a buyer with deep 
pockets?  How much value was put into DPC by the shareholders?

2.     Are there local public policy issues that could be addressed by local 
courts with respect to the LNG contracts?  Fraud?  Bribery?  Are there any 
local law issues with respect to performance or interpretation of the 
contracts?  Isn't take-or-pay meaningless without credit support?

3.     What are the arguments for DPC to terminate the contracts?  Only where 
the PPA is terminated?  Payments?

4.    Who negotiated the contracts?  Were there requests for credit support?  
>From Enron?  Did Enron ever promise to indirectly "backstop" the contracts by 
its investment in Dabhol?

5.   What was the discussion regarding the "reduction in operational 
capability" language in the contracts?  What was the language meant to 
cover?  Do we need our counterparty's approval to investigate other markets?

6.    Is there any argument that DPC has already breached the contracts?  
Could our counterparties issue a press release claiming damages over the 
entire term of the contract? Confidentiality and press releases?

7.    What is the law on piercing the corporate veil for an Indian company 
like DPC?  Could this issue be considered separate from the contract and be 
litigated in India or Oman and thus outside the arbitration?

8.     What is the list of all documents that could impact on whether or not 
Enron has any exposure under the LNG contracts?

9.     Are there instances where the Dabhol project could fail and the LNG 
contracts would not novate to MSEB?  Why does it matter if the LNG contract 
obligations novate to MSEB if DPC has no money?

10.   Other potential claims against Enron if the LNG contracts are 
terminated or not performed?

Mike, 
Know you're extremely busy -- Suzanne tells me positions at rarified heights 
are driven by the need for crisis intervention. Members of your LNG team tell 
me that Eric Gonzales is coming to Houston to lead Western Hemispheric 
activities.  Maybe the three of us could meet for breakfast somewhere close 
to your offices.
Let me know a convenient time and date. 
Bob

Mike: 
Understand LNG continues to be an enigma cloaked in a mystery for Enron.  We 
are continuing to expand our coverage and knowledge base of this marketplace, 
especially in the Western Hemisphere and would like to meet with you to 
discuss our observations and learn more about Enron's desires in this arena.  
Also, we have a meeting planned in D.C. in late June, entitled "LNG's Role in 
North American & Caribbean Gas Supply."  With the U.S. hunger for gas and El 
Paso, AEC and other's announcements of new projects, the meeting should be 
constructive, especially with DOE and FERC involvement.  See summary below.
Let me know when you might be available to discuss the LNG marketplace.  
We've just completed a white paper, entitled "Atlantic-Basin LNG: A Whirling 
Supply/Demand Balance."  You may find our conclusions of interest.

*********************************** 
TITLE:  LNG's Role in North American & Caribbean Gas Supply 
DATE/LOCATION:  Washington D.C., June 27-29 
SUMMARY:  The winter of 2000/2001 confirmed the shift in the United States 
from a buyer's to a seller's market. Gas supplies for North America ran short 
as demand rose from colder weather, higher electricity demand and shortages 
in storage from the previous year.  More and more supply is shifting from the 
U.S. Gulf Coast to Western Canada as offshore exploration in the Gulf of 
Mexico has proven disappointing.  U.S. demand for power generation is 
expected to keep gas demand high through the summer of 2001, siphoning off 
gas that would have been destined for storage.  
Meanwhile during the long gas bubble of the 1980s, drilling rigs and 
experienced field personnel dwindled from thousands to several hundred.  The 
current rig count for North American gas exploration and production is near 
full capacity at just over 600 rigs, so the industry is constrained on how 
quickly it can recover.  
The U.S. has not experienced shortages of natural gas like this since the 
1970s and early 1980s when it was feared that the nation would run out of gas 
in 10 years.  Four LNG import terminals were built to supply natural gas from 
North Africa (Algeria).  These terminals are capable of supplying up to 5% of 
total U.S. gas consumption (about one trillion cubic feet per year).  Plans 
are underway to have all four terminals fully operational by the end of 2002; 
however, more are needed.  
Conventional wisdom is that no new terminals would be built in the United 
States due to EPA laws and local citizen protests to any facility perceived 
to be unsightly or dangerous.  Now, El Paso (a company that was burned by 
Congress in the 1980s by the ruling that take-or-pay LNG contracts with 
Algeria were invalid) is challenging conventional wisdom. They have announced 
plans for six new terminals to be built in North America: three in the United 
States and three in Mexico.    New LNG plants in Venezuela, Algeria and 
Northern Australia might supply these terminals. 
Other companies, such as Enron and AEC, have announced plans to build 
terminals in the Caribbean to supply gas to independent power production 
(IPP) plants ranging from 400 to 1000 megawatts.  Moreover, LNG facilities on 
Caribbean Islands close to Florida might export gas or electricity via 
undersea pipeline and cable.  Floating offshore LNG terminals may also offer 
a means to bring LNG into the United States with less environmental and 
community concern.  
The June 27-29 conference, entitled "LNG's Role in North American & Caribbean 
Gas Supply," will cover the dynamics that are leading to North American gas 
supply shortages, how long they are expected to last, and what source of 
natural gas are available from conventional sources to meet demand.  The 
conference will then focus on opportunities for LNG, including the capacities 
and timing of current terminals, the prospects for new mainland and offshore 
terminals, and the opportunity for broader terminal networks in the 
Caribbean, including those facilities that might supply gas or electricity to 
the United States.

Shanna,

I certainly believe that Jennifer is better than Kim.  Jeff is certainly the 
appropriate judge but she is very young and has a lot yet to learn.  This 
comment is not meant as a cut down at all.   John's questionable judgement 
shouldn't just be trumped however.

Mike and Jeff,

I wanted to let you know that Kim Hillis is being promoted from Sr. Admin to 
Executive Assistant.  

Cathy Phillips, Nicki Daw and Kay Chapman are also Executive Assistants.

Please let me know if we need to re-visit a promotion for Jennifer and 
whether it should be considered now, mid year or at a later time.

Thanks,

I enjoyed it as well.  We all have a lot to do and money to make!  I got a 
long voicemail back from K Lay on my message to him and he heard me on the 
ePower side.  He also said that he had heard similar concerns as well.  

Rick Bergseiker (LNG) will be calling you.  He left me a voicemail that he

Who would have thought we would ever see the day that the J-Block contract 
was making so much money that the J-Block parties would intentionally default 
under it?  I guess we were just too good at our jobs...  My quick look at the 
amended contract tells me that our best contractual avenue is to analyze the 
possibility of wilful default under the contract, in which case the cap on 
damages would not apply.  Peter, as you and I discussed, the Bacton option 
may help our analysis on this.  I definitely would want to get outside 
counsel advice on the point, and in any event I agree that going to Mulva is 
the right approach to begin with.  Peter, let me know what you want me to do 
next, i.e., should we let the upper management contact run its course before 
I go for outside advice?  I expect so, but please let me know.  Ciao.

John,

Hello from South America.  I just got your email and I certainly concur with 
Jeff making the call.  He has maintained a good relationship with Mulva. This 
was a risk that we had but we did have assurances from Phillips regarding 
performance.  I don't know how much it will help however.  Richard Harper and 
Mary Nell Browning may have some ideas here but I am sure you've already gone 
through it with them.  I am amazed how the details get fuzzy on an old 
project.  When you discussed it, i was trying to think back to our remedies 
and discussions but the 3 years have made it difficult.

I don't know if there is anything I can do but I'm always willing to help.

Good luck,
Mike

Subject: J-Block


I mentioned on our conference call on Monday that J-Block has had problems 
meeting our nominations from the Judy/Joanne/Janice reservoirs.

Up until recent CATS maintenance shutdown on 15 May, they were making up for 
reduced production volumes by nominating to supply gas at the NBP which they 
are entitled but not obliged to do.  Since return from outage at the end of 
May they have declined to nominate at the NBP.  

>From 1 January to 15 May, the Sellers use of the NBP delivery option kept 
underdeliveries to 350 mmcf (ie one day's maximum quantity) in total.  Since 
returning from the maintenance shutdown, underdeliveries have totalled 850 
mmcf ( averaging 77mcf/d ).

We believe that following the sharp rise in market prices during the 
maintenance period, they have decided to default on the contract rather than 
make up deliveries from other sources.   They have an effective cap on the 
penalties of about 5 pence per therm (after taking into account the value of 
the liquids) and therefore they are not making up the volumes when the daily 
price is substantially higher than about 16 pence per therm.

Prior to the CATS shutdown, we had made them a proposal to enable them to 
deliver additional volumes at  another alternative to avoid default but they 
have not responded yet.

You mentioned that in your negotiations with Phillips they had committed to 
getting us all the gas regardless of the cap on the penalties.  This has cost 
us about $1.5 million to date and they seem to be institutionalising their 
non performance.    Perhaps a phone call by you might help.  

By the way I will be in Houston on Thursday and Friday to meet with the 
delegation from Croatia and I will probably be tied up the entire time but if 
you need me
for a phone call I can break away.

John

The presentation below identifies the size of the Non-Ferrous metals market.  
It was put together by our Corporate Development Team.  As there is no 
"authoritative text" for quantifying the market size, our guys had to rely on 
several industry publications, consultants and MG employee estimates. 

Steel Market Size:
825 million metric tons produced per year (@ an average price of $400 ton), 
the physical market size is $330 Billion
Merrill Lynch, in their Steel Report dated April 14, 2000, quantifies the 
total steel market at slightly over $800 billion (approx. 1.7 billion tons).  
Merrill assumes steel turns over 2 times by the time it reaches the final 
consumer.
Steel consumption in the US is 135 million metric tons per year (production 
is 105 million metric tons)

David,

Attached for your information is an email from the CEO of Six Foot Studios.  
This guy is the brother-in- law of Robin Gibbs, one of the top litigators in 
the country.  Robin and his firm is used a great deal in our key cases for 
Enron.  This looks like a cool company but I have no idea if you have any 
interest in his company or it's products.  I do, however, need someone to 
follow-up with him, even if it is a polite discussion that we don't have any 
interest.  We need to respond in some manner.  I forwarded this a while ago 
but he didn't hear anything.

He is successfully getting in to companies in Houston and Compaq is a big 
supporter.  I hope there is an opportunity here.

Thanks,
Mike

Below are the primary DCF assumptions:

1.  WACC = 11%

2.  EBIT from existing business was calculated as an average of 1999 and 2000 
with certain adjustments.  Growth rate is 4% per annum.

3.  Financial trading earnings estimates as per John Nowlan are as follows 
(urea and ammonia only):  
Yr 1 - $0.5MM
Yr 2 - $2.5MM
Yr 3 - $5.0MM
Yr 4 - $7.8MM
Yr 5 and future - $10.3MM per year

4.  Origination earnings estimates as per John Nowlan are as follows (all 
products):
Yr 1 - $5MM
Yr 2 - $10MM
Yr 3 - $20MM
Yr 4 - $25MM
Yr 5 - $30MM
Future - $5MM incremental earnings every year

5.  Working capital requirements continue to grow at the same pace (ie. no

Thanks, it was great and long over due.  The cold and rain didn't stop the 
ultimate enjoyment including 35,000 people chanting "over rated".  It was 
great and we must enjoy it until the Sat. when reality comes back to the 
sooners and we lose the next 2 or 3 straight.  K State, Neb and Tex A&M.  
Ouch, nice 4 game stretch.

Subject: Summary on Bremen Deal

Hi George,

as requested just a quick summary on the Bremen transaction which was final=

signed by Bremen on Thursday (yesterday I also received the signed contract=
=20
from Bremen).

 Term:
 from 1 May 2001 to December 2006, although we have already delivered since=
=20
1/1/01 under the same contract terms as the long-term agreement.

 Volume:
 4.6 Mio. t firm over 6 years=20
  2001: 935=20
  2002: 820
  2003: 820
  2004: 820
  2005: 615 (tail-off due to expected shut-down of one block)=20
  2006: 615=20
 For 2002 to 2006, this will cover about 80% of Bremen's needs. We can be=
=20
very confident to also attract the remaining 20% in the open tenders due to=
=20
advantages on logistics and possible matching of best price.

 Quality:
 Generic with very generous quality specs (wider than SECA; also allows for=
=20
1.7% sulphur)
 Under the deal we can also deliver 10% as pet coke (if the blend meets the=
=20
wide quality specs)

 Pricing:=20
 We deliver CIF @ BAW price. BAW is weighted average import price which lag=
s=20
the market by 2-3 quarters. In rising markets we lose against spot purchase=
,=20
in falling market we win against it.
 If Bremen takes less than 10% pet coke, we will get a premium for each %=
=20
point that Bremen underlifts. In this case, we are either financially deeme=
d=20
to have delivered pet coke (we get the difference between BAW price and pet=
=20
coke) or a fixed premium of $0.15/t per each % point (max. of BAW price +=
=20
$1.50)

 Strategic Advantages of Deal:
 -  Significant position in the German market; breakthrough transaction in=

coal imports. It will make us one of the established players and help foste=
r=20

 -  Longer-term volume flow in Northern Germany that will create economies =
of=20
scale for the supply of smaller customers in the area;
 -  Building Nordenham as the bridgehead for the supply of Northern Germany=
;=20
With increasing imports into Germany the Bremen volumes will enable ECS to=
=20
take an active port position in Nordenham. This may be valuable since port=
=20
capacity will have increasing value (currently under scrutiny).
 -  Optionality on remaining synor tonnage; abilitay to fill in remaining 2=
0%=20
of Bremen needs. This can already be seen this year where we are expected t=
o=20
deliver 935,000 instead of the contracted 820,000.
 - Upside from delivery of more of 10% of contractual volumes as petroleum=
=20
coke (we can do this, if technically ok - under the contract Bremen actuall=
y=20
has incentives to burn more than 10%).
 - Follow-on Deals with Bremen; we have started discussions on a coal-fired=

power block that Bremen would like to rent out to us and Bremen has offered=
=20
us to do all their port business in Nordenham (thus, we would transform CIF=

George, if you have any questions related to the deal and its structure,=20
please do not hesitate to call either Manfred or myself (011-49 173 3070824=

Kind regards

Our ability in crude is apparently very poor.  What can J Wilson do thru 
2010?  I want the crude desk to make us a price and present an acceptable 
volume.  

If we have to suggest to PDVSA only doing a crude index through 2012, I 
strongly believe we should try if we can create some additional value thru 
this structure.  Tell me if you would like me to give him a call to explain 
what the effort potentially create.

Subject: Re: Jose LNG - Crude Pricing  

 Per a conversation I had with John Wilson the head crude oil trader in the 
Houston office, the feasability of hedging price risk linked to WTI or Brent 
on a 20 year deal is NOT a possibility.  If we had 1/3 of our GSA price 
linked to Brent our exposure for 20 years would be about 30 million barrels 
notional or about 14 million barrels PV.  At 5% our exposure would still be 5 
million notional or 2.3 million PV.  According to John, he would not be 
comfortable doing anything past 2012 and even out that far he would not 
consider doing more than about 1 million PV barrels in the years 2010 - 
2012.  Given these comments, I would say that the size of our deal basically 
precludes a look at Crude Oil hedges at this time.  As far as the economics 
of the deal are concerned, we basically cannot even get an Offer to use to 
figure out our economics.  I am confident that if we pushed the issue to see 
if we could get a 20 year offer even for a small portion of the volumes that 
the hedging costs would be too high, and therefore have left it at that for 
the time being.   Please advise if you have any thoughts on the issue.

Thanks,

Eric

Eric, thanks for your comments. Please see below in blue our observations and 
answers. Let's talk later today if you have further questions.

Saludos

Guido and Emilio 


Enron Offtake Agreement

Section 2
Should this agreement start at commercial hand over of the plant under the 
EPC agreement.  Benefit here is LDs under the EPC for late delivery go to 
project company and project company has no obligation to lng buyers.  In 
addition it preserves your 20 year offtake which should still match your GSA.

 The agreement should start at commercial hand over of the plant as you say. 
The draft as it is now has only outer limits as to when that should happen 
(that being the earlier of 40 months after Financial  Close or NTP or Dec 31 
2004). We will add to this list "the earlier of" something like: "the date on 
which the plant has produced LNG at at least 90% of its capacity for a period 
of 10 consecutive days". We suggest putting something like this as opposed to 
"commercial hand over" because this is in the plant's/contractor's control 
and they could, for example, on purpose not meet a noise level requirement 
for 4 months  for example and delay commencement of the offtake contract 
while the project sells LNG at higher prices than in the term sheets.

With regards to the EPC LDs we agree that they should go only to the project 
but we, as offtakers, can not wait for ever for the project to be completed 
with out receiving gas or damages for something that is somehow (directly or 
indirectly) under the project's control. We have 4 months limits to how much 
the project can be delayed on top of all the conservatism that EECC (or 
another EPC Contractor) already built in.  

Section 6
I would like to see some language in this section describing the pricing 
formula associated with expansions.  Structure could be set as in this 
contract where Pg is to reflect GSA costs and where the combined value of 
Pcpi and Pa should be derived to provide an equity return to the sponsors of 
18%.

 We agree that would be better, but we included this section knowing that is 
something that is going to be a very difficult sell with PDVSA, because they 
don't want us to sell down and then keep "controlling" new  LNG businesses in 
Jose. They will oppose this clause as they violently opposed the limited 
exclusivity at Jose that we managed to include in the GSA. We think that 
adding a restriction to the asset's returns now in the draft will make it 
very tough to sell to PDVSA the entire Clause. Thus, jeopardizing our chance 
to control the output of future plants or expansions. We never intended to 
use these off-take agreements as a vehicle to control future LNG volumes. 
Nevertheless, we felt it was a good chance for us to start getting partial 
control of the output. Pushing it too much will back fire and PDVSA will 
clearly realize what our intent is.

Section 7
Where is the bonus calculation?  We did not include it now on purpose. We 
will include it when ever they "remind" us to do so. We want to have another 
fight about the bonus.
Where is the min price? The minimum price is in. We say that one of the  
terms in the price is Pg x En where En is never less than one
I thought you guys were going to trade out CPI for a fixed number? We are 
going to try to do it, but that is first a GSA issue, and we don't want to 
put it here as something firm before we change it in the GSA. We precisely 
bracketed the CPI percentage in the formula because of our thought that we 
want to make it zero  
Have you decided that a WTI index percentage does not help the economics? No, 
we don't have the definitive answer from structuring yet, but our guess and 
based on our meeting with RAC the other day, in which they told us about the 
mess created by an oil escalation in Cuiba (Brazil power plant), we are 
pretty much convinced that oil escalation without oil based LNG sales is not 
convenient. But since we don't have a definitive answer yet we still included 
oil as a possible escalator with a zero weighting (that should have been 
bracketed in the term-sheet, though, and it will).  

Section 10
you have incorporated the GSA default rate for late payment as opposed to the 
Equilibrium rate.  Is this your intent to have a mismatch?
 Yes, we did it on purpose because this will apply also to PDVSA as 
off-taker, and they have a record of paying late so we want them to suffer if 
they do.

you have all new taxes being borne by the project company.  Will the banks 
accept this as the project company will be thinly capitalized.  See section 
18 of the Arcos CTA for ideas if this is an issue.
 The exporter of record will be the project, so the buyer has no business in 
Venezuela other than paying port fees. We do not see any kind of taxes that 
could be imposed on Buyer by Venezuela that would eventually be transferred 
to the project. Banks should be fine with this as this is a risk that 
projects typically take all the time (the heavy crude projects are some 
examples in Venezuela). In addition, the GSA provides for a number of reliefs 
for the Project Company that will help Banks and equity holders to feel 
safer. Although, a large portion of the underlying risk is always there. 

Other
where are the LD calculations explained?  I think you need LDs for GSA 
default and another for plant default.  GSA default should match LD's in GSA 
contract less compensation to plant debt recovery.
 In stead of writing an explicit LD calculation our lawyers suggested that 
the sole use of New York law to rule the deal was simpler and better. New 
York law provides for full market based damages (market price of commodity 
plus extra costs) which is the maximum you can get in a negotiation for an LD 
clause. So, from a legal and commercial point of view we much rather have it 
as it is. We are still discussing w/ Brent Price and Cris Sherman if this is 
sellable to AA for MTM, but our initial view is that it should be since the 
level of LD can not be better. GSA default is market based (provided that 
PDVSA, as we expect, accepts the change we will propose) so the Project 
Company will be able to pay market based damages. For interruption of gas 
supply from PDV for Force Majeure reasons our insurance team is finding out 
if the market will cover such risk so that the project can afford not being 
relieved from performance in such event (this will obviously be to a maximum 
dollar limit to be determined and for a maximum period of time, say 36 months 
- we need time to give you precision on this, but some sort of coverage will 
be available). 

suppose the plant produces 5% less that it is supposed to due to design or 
tech problems (not a FM issue) at commercial hand over.  What happens under 
the offtake agreements?  Will the banks accept this revenue short fall?  Will 
we have to create a reserve?  This may be a big issue with the banks for 
technology reasons and lack of experience in this industry.
  Under the off-take agreements the project pays market based damages if it 
does not meet the contracted volume. We believe that the contracted volume 
that we included in the term sheets though has enough of a cushion for banks 
and equity holders to bear the risk. We are contracting for contractually 
guaranteed production under the EPC which is 3% lower than expected. On top 
of that we are considering LNG production with the richest inlet gas possible 
(meaning a lower LNG volume). This volume is 5% lower than the guaranteed 
production with "Normal" or expected feed composition. Combining these two we 
have a contracted quantity that is 8% lower than the expected production with 
expected feed. On top of this it is important to note that every single LNG 
plant in the world ended up with a production capacity that is at least 10% 
above what was expected (mostly due to EPC Contractors and tech partners 
making very safe assumptions on guaranteed volumes to avoid LDs). Also the 
EPC contract being negotiated provides for pretty severe LD in case of 
production shortfalls that are enough to pay for debt and make equity-holders 
whole. They don't provide though, for damages payable under off-take 
contracts (nobody will take this potentially huge exposure on LDs). However, 
as we explained, we believe that this is a risk that is typically taken by 
producers and that we have already taken a very conservative assumption in 
the volume contracted and that should be beard by the Project Co. Banks will 
most definitely also take a conservative volume assumption, as we already 
did. 

What happens if plant starts producing less for a few weeks until problem is 
resolved? what compensation do the offtakers get? do the banks suffer here as 
well?
 The term sheet establishes an annual quantity as the only standard to 
determine failure to deliver by Seller. It also establishes that deliveries 
should be at rates and intervals that are reasonably constant. The bottom 
line is that the termsheets do not go into all the detail about timing of 
defaults and price differentials. It sets, however, a reasonable standard by 
which if at the end of the year seller did not deliver the full annual 
quantity and a particular month can be identified where the deficiency occur 
based on the "reasonable constant deliveries" provision, damages will be 
payable based on prices during such month. Yes banks suffer here to the 
extent that the cause of the short fall is not insurable.  Nevertheless, 
short periods (weeks) of failures to deliver by seller will really not affect 
the Project Company ability to pay the Banks.  It will have to be some 
prolonged period for Banks to be affected.   

Under a plant FM issue you may not get BI cover for the first 60 days.  Will 
the banks accept this or will they want a reserve established.  Is this in 
your model?
 We are not sure off what the banks are going to require in this regard 
(although, we agree that some sort of reserve or LC is to be expected). Our 
model assumes the cost of an LC for 6 month debt service (which should be 
plenty). The issue here is if MTM is going to be able to live with the same 
or longer grace period for damages to kick in under the termsheet and weather 
damages (not BI) are insurable and to what extent if FM relief is not 
permitted for MTM reasons. The question that follows is: if damages exceed 
the insured limits in a FM event that does not relief the project from its 
obligation to deliver, have the damages have to be senior to debt payments 
for AA to allow MTM to be permitted? If this is so, are the banks going to be 
willing to live with this?, probably not.

insert something on planned maintenance timing and scheduling.
 It is briefly covered in section 9 second paragraph. This will be expended 
in later drafts once the PA is signed and we are home free with regard to 
PDVSA.

insert termination section
 In light of the fact that we will end up being more of an off-taker than an 
asset owner in this project our lawyers suggest that we will get better 
protection if early termination is ruled by what is provided under NY law 
than if we try to right an early termination clause. They point out also that 
90% of LNG contracts are done in this way, having NY law rule the game. They 
point out also that from the project point of view banks are very used to and 
prefer having early termination be ruled by NY law.
  
put something in about the buyer willing to accept entering direct agreements 
for financing requirements?
 We will

Enron Offtake Agreement

Section 2
Should this agreement start at commercial hand over of the plant under the 
EPC agreement.  Benefit here is LDs under the EPC for late delivery go to 
project company and project company has no obligation to lng buyers.  In 
addition it preserves your 20 year offtake which should still match your GSA.

Section 6
I would like to see some language in this section describing the pricing 
formula associated with expansions.  Structure could be set as in this 
contract where Pg is to reflect GSA costs and where the combined value of 
Pcpi and Pa should be derived to provide an equity return to the sponsors of 
18%.

Section 7
Where is the bonus calculation? 
Where is the min price?
I thought you guys were going to trade out CPI for a fixed number?
Have you decided that a WTI index percentage does not help the economics?

Section 10
you have incorporated the GSA default rate for late payment as opposed to the 
Equilibrium rate.  Is this your intent to have a mismatch?
you have all new taxes being borne by the project company.  Will the banks 
accept this as the project company will be thinly capitalised.  See section 
18 of the Arcos CTA for ideas if this is an issue.

Other
where are the LD calculations explained?  I think you need LDs for GSA 
default and another for plant default.  GSA default should match LD's in GSA 
contract less compensation to plant debt recovery.
suppose the plant produces 5% less that it is supposed to due to design or 
tech problems (not a FM issue) at commercial hand over.  What happens under 
the offtake agreements?  Will the banks accept this revenue short fall?  Will 
we have to create a reserve?  This may be a big issue with the banks for 
technology reasons and lack of experience in this industry.
What happens if plant starts producing less for a few weeks until problem is 
resolved? what compensation do the offtakers get? do the banks suffer here as 
well?
Under a plant FM issue you may not get BI cover for the first 60 days.  Will 
the banks accept this or will they want a reserve established.  Is this in 
your model?
insert something on planned maintenance timing and scheduling.
insert termination section
put something in about the buyer willing to accept entering direct agreements 
for financing requirements?

Subject: Jose LNG - Off-take

I am enclosing a draft of the off-take termsheets to be included in the 
Participation Agreement between Enron and PDVSA Gas. These termsheets will 
rule the following transactions:

  a) Sale of LNG from the Project to an affiliate of  Enron for the plant's 
output minus PDVSA's off-take

  b) Sale of LNG from the project to and affiliate of PDVSA Gas for the share 
of volumes equivalent their equity participation in the Project Co

  c) Re-sale of LNG from the affiliate of PDVSA Gas to the Enron affiliate 
for the volumes purchased by PDVSA according to b) above

Please let Emilio and I know your comments about them at your earliest 
convenience. Please focus on issues with regard to our ability to MTM these 
contracts, such as the force majeure clause. If you have any comments or 
questions during the weekend you can reach me at 713 304-4264 or Emilio at 
011 5814 330-9016. Otherwise we would like to discuss this with you on Monday.

Thanks for your input and happy Thanks-giving

Guido

Thanks for the email.  It did cause an interesting conversation without 
knowing what the situation was.  We all have very open relationships around 
here (it is why we are so successful as a company).  Please don't think twice 
about responding to Greg or any senior manager on an issue - but he would 
also have no issue with your response being cc back to Jeff and/or myself at

Thanks,
Mike

Mike:  Randy Maffitt, recommended I send you my resume.  I would be very 
interested in talking with you about activity within Global Markets at your 
convenience.  I am currently in ENA, but with the scaling back of our 
development efforts and my Int'l experience, I thought we would have a lot to 
talk about.  Thanks, Thomas x58286.

Pelt,

Howdy from Houston.  I hope you had a great Thanksgiving.  I took the week 
off and it was what i needed.  I have been working at a hectic pace and was 
on my annual sick rotation, although a little earlier than normal.  I needed 
the break.  My international traveling is over for the year, thank God.

Chris and i were talking about life and vacations and spring break came up.  
I thought i would send you our information and see if our breaks co-ordinated 
and to see if we still wanted to try and get together to go skiing.  We 
didn't know if you made other plans or moved on since our last discussion a 
while ago.  Our spring break is March 12-16th .

Please let give an update via email when you get a chance.  I figured that 
you are in Telluride right now on holiday.

Give my love to all.

Mike



PS - How about those Sooners!  OU/TX wasn't a fluke. Hard to believe, we'll 
see what will happen with K State and bowls.  No matter, its been a fun 
year.  It is nice to be back.

EGM has the largest number of trading books in the company with over 500 
active books and despite this you guys do the best job getting worldwide 
information to us in a timely and accurate fashion. (I wish I could get the 
rest of the company to this point). I'm told that the people referenced below 
have contributed in a big way to this effort. Thanks for the effort. Rick

Rick,

Following up on our discussion this morning, Scott Earnest and his staff ( 
including Michelle Bruce) need to be recognized for their outstanding efforts 
in providing timely information to Risk.

Their initiative came along about the same time Jeff Shankman took over 
Global Markets; it enables them to run a same day VaR for worldwide trading ( 
Houston, London and Singapore books are all closed in Houston ) as well as 
for us to to get our "official " information reliably by the the opening of 
business next day.

Thank you for your email and I apologize for my delay in responding.  For 
just over a year now, we have been working with multiple areas within EES to 
develop opportunities on two fronts: 1) transferring EES's weather exposure 
into the weather derivatives market place and 2) developing products for EES 
to offer to its clients and/or that allow EES to bid more aggressively.

We are very excited about the changes that have taken place at EES and are 
hopeful that we can now begin a mutually beneficial working relationship.  As 
you will see from the attached two documents, we are actively engaged with 
Gordon Savage's group and have a number of individuals within the weather 
group who are familiar with EES.  The Harrah's opportunity originated by Ken 
Rubeli appears to have the most immediate potential to provide an EES client 
with a weather hedge. After the changes, Mallik Avs contacted us to start an 
initiative to hedge volume risk with weather derivatives.

On the weather desk, we are currently very interested in getting long Cooling 
Degree Days ("CDDs"), i.e. hot weather in southern California and the desert 
southwest.  Our currently long position there has done extremely well and we 
will be capping out on those positions shortly.  We believe that if EES were 
to directly approach the weather market place for CDD Calls or swaps you 
could obtain positions that we are unable to i.e. we would like EES to sleeve 
for the weather desk.



Again, we are excited about the new management team and structure at EES and 
look forward to an opportunity to work with you and your people.

Hey Mark. I've talked with both Jeff and Mike, and everyone agrees that we 
need to ensure we can bring weather risk management and products into the EES 
distribution channel. I'd like to know how we can leverage your group, its 
knowledge and capability to maximize the opportunities we have to move 
weather products into our sales channels. 

Also, I understand we are currently working weather products into several 
deals. Harrah's Entertainment is one that is a high priority for us. Please 
let me know if I can help facilitate taking these discussions/ideas and 
turning them into executable products.

I'd appreciate your thoughts on the above items at your earliest convenience. 
Thanks!

Jeff,

Steve Horn is pushing for us to speak at this conference in Aspen.  I told 
him that I am not available but it does look good and it is in a nice place - 
also the speakers are first rate.  What do you think?  If you are interested 
please let Steve know.  I told him that I thought everyone was busy.

per your request, attached is a list of speakers at the Industry Standard

My suggestion would be for me to go ahead and RSVP that I will do the speech. 
If McMahon is available and wants to do it then we will have the slot held.

Subject: First Gas Writedown

First Gas is a liquid fuel supply deal executed in May, 1997 that is linked 
to a power plant in the Phillipines.  Volumes were booked at 31,000 barrels 
per day with delivery starting June, 1999 through Dec., 2002.  Fuel 
deliveries did not begin until April, 2000 and have averaged between 
10,000-12,000 barrels per day, well below the volumetric level that was 
booked.   This deficiency is due to delayed plant start-up and reduced 
consumption and has resulted in approximately $1 million per month in accrual 
losses to the Global Products group since April, 2000.  To make matters 
worse, the power purchaser from First Gas has recently announced that they 
are going to minimally dispatch the power plant to which this transaction is 
linked through the end of 2001.

To properly reflect the current volumetric levels associated with First Gas, 
we need to take volumes from the 31,000 barrels per day level that was 
originally booked to approximately 6,000 barrels per day for the remainder of 
the deal.

In addition, freight charges related to this deal have doubled since April, 
2000 increasing from the $.70 originally booked to the current $1.45.  Per 
conversations with John Chismar he expects freight to remain at this level 
for the foreseeable future.

To properly reflect the current costs of this deal, we need to increase the 
Dubai spread to which this deal was booked from $2.91 to approximately 
$3.65.  Initial estimates of the loss resulting from both the volumetric and 
cost proposed write-down of First Gas is $30 million.  We are continuing to 
refine this number and will update you when we get a final amount.

On a final note, Arthur Andersen has repeatedly reviewed First Gas throughout 
2000 and to this point we have been able to spin enough of an argument to 
justify delaying a writedown.  Given the current market conditions discussed 
above (which are publicly known), the size of the writedown and the fact that 
their next review will be for year-end earnings, I believe Arthur Andersen is 
going to require us to write down at least a substantial portion of First Gas 
before they will sign-off on earnings.  Obviously, I have not recently 
discussed this with AA&Co. but I do anticipate this being an earnings issue.

Please call me if you wish to discuss further.  I appreciate any help you can 
give us in this matter.

We have made reservations for Fri. and Sat,  I didn't make yours but i
would move quickly.  Would you like me to set up a tee time and massages
for the girls?  I figured a 1 pm tee time?  Also what about tickets for the
game itself.  Will you have access as years gone by or does the search need

Jonny,

Thank you so much for the email and kind words.  I was very moved by it and
you know I feel the same way.  I have become very reflective with the more
"success" that I have been fortunate enough to receive.  I am so thankful
and appreciative and although I have always been religious and spiritual,
it has grown more deeply.  I see so many people that have lost their
perspective and I pray that I will remain grounded and truly appreciate the
blessings that our family has received.  Chris and I often discuss how we
can help others and what can we do to really make a difference.

The Jones and the McConnells are truly very lucky.   Thanks, and give my
love to your family.

Mike


PS:  What about OU - Texas, do you have any ideas or plans already in the
works?

Sometimes we fail to stop and reflect on events which are of significance
because we are so busy with our heads down accomplishing the things we
strive for.  I hope you are taking a moment to reflect and enjoy the
incredible accomplishments which you have achieved at such a young age.
You

to give back what we have been so fortunate to receive.

Congratulations and keep up the good work.  I am proud to call you my

Steve,

FYI, here was my response to Michael.  I was surprised that you didn't know 
about this but i probably shouldn't have been.  Let me know if you have a 
different opinion.

Mike,

I agree with your assessment on keeping tabs on them but currently I don't 
see any real opportunity or decision to spend time or money with this 
effort.  I have received feedback from others in the group as well and they 
agree with our general thinking.  Have you talked with Louise lately?  We are 
announcing today that we will be pushing our pricing to other platforms in 
the US (therefore we keep all the liquidity of their markets).  Maybe this 
will apply to these guys, someday.  Certainly it is not appropriate now and 
with your domination concerns it might scare them even more.

My time is very limited next week and I am double booked most of the time.   
I'm out Wed - Sunday and then the analyst meetings begin after that.  I 
really don't have time to meet with them especially if there is not real deal 
pending.  Is there someone else that is more appropriate, maybe someone can 
take them through EOL?  If you like that, please call Louise and co-ordinate.

Thanks,
Mike

I tend to agree with your initial comments. At this point I do not see a 
clear opportunity from a value standpoint but I do need to assist these guys 
and keep tabs on their development.

To me it looks more like a Streamline or Quick Trade product that is at the 
drawing board stage.  They are going to Oklahoma on Friday. William's may be 
the best group for them to ultimately hook up with. 

It is possible that the only thing we can offer this group latter on is a 
link to EOL if we so choose that to be advantageous. This market is too small 
and there is growing concern that EOL is a looming beast that will dominate 
market share. For now I need to continue to foster these projects until one 
is successful or EOL is no longer a political concern.

 Could you be available for a presentation Monday or Tuesday. I will 
participate via conference call. 

Your assistance is greatly appreciated.

Mike,
I just had my schedule changed dramatically for tomorrow and will not be able 
to talk.  How about Friday @ 10am?
Sorry, but we have a situation I must get involved with and change a 
direction.

I did review the email, and passed it on to others.  I do not see much from 
this site nor how it is actually going to develop real liquidity in the 
market.  If there are a couple of items that you want me to specifically be 
ready for , please send me a couple of comments via email or voicemail.

Thanks,
Mike

Mike and Sally:

I have been in contact with Ted Jacobs and have volunteered $1500 in 
scholarship funds to be awarded by Enron this spring.  By volunteering this 
money, we are now able to attend scholarship interviews on Tuesday, March 6 
on campus.  This will provide us with the opportunity to target candidates 
for next fall and lay the groundwork for a more competitive future.

After we have identified our scholarship recipients, we are invited to 
present our awards at the Scholarship Awards Banquet on Friday, April 20.  

Ted will (if he has not already) approach you, Mike, to see if you are 
interested in playing a role at this event.   If you are available to attend, 
please let me know.  I plan to have at least 2 Enron representatives at the 
event.

I just wanted to give each of you these details to keep you fully informed of 
our efforts on campus.  If you have any questions or suggestions, please let 
me know.


Thank you,

Jeff -- Here is an update on our discussions with Phillips over their lack of 
performance on
delivery of gas during high price periods.   I will see you next week at the 
PRC and give you
a further update on our progress with them.

Subject: J-Block Update

Following the meeting Richard and I had with Jim Simpson of Phillips and the 
letter we subsequently sent requesting more information, Phillips have 
proposed a technical meeting to discuss production problems and a commercial 
meeting to discuss alternative solutions.

The technical meeting is scheduled for Friday of this week and we will be 
taking advisers so that we can assess the extent of the problem and the 
adequacy of the Sellers plans for remedial action.

The commercial meeting took place on Tuesday.  The Sellers took the position 
that they were happy to continue discussions regarding deliveries at Bacton 
or at the NBP but that they would need compensating for any additional 
risks/costs that they would incur.  Essentially, if they have alternative 
sources of gas available, they do not want to sell it to us at the contract 
price when they can get significantly more value in the market.  We made it 
clear that we were looking for a commercial solution which would enable them 
to deliver contract gas at the contract price at an alternative location.

At the end of the meeting, the Sellers agreed to respond to our previous 
proposal on Bacton deliveries, and to formulate an additional proposal on NBP 
deliveries.  This will probably take a couple of weeks.

In the meantime, following the technical meeting on Friday, we will be able 
to take a more informed view regarding the extent to which the Sellers are to 
blame for the current problems - eg lack of investment, failure to act as an 
RPO etc.  

My current thinking is that we then exert pressure on them to deliver the gas 
at the alternative locations at contract price through management pressure 
(Mulva) and contractual pressure (failure to act as RPO etc).

I will update you early next week when we have reviewed the information from 
the technical meeting.


Regards

Peter

Subject: First Gas Writedown

First Gas is a liquid fuel supply deal executed in May, 1997 that is linked 
to a power plant in the Phillipines.  Volumes were booked at 31,000 barrels 
per day with delivery starting June, 1999 through Dec., 2002.  Fuel 
deliveries did not begin until April, 2000 and have averaged between 
10,000-12,000 barrels per day, well below the volumetric level that was 
booked.   This deficiency is due to delayed plant start-up and reduced 
consumption and has resulted in approximately $1 million per month in accrual 
losses to the Global Products group since April, 2000.  To make matters 
worse, the power purchaser from First Gas has recently announced that they 
are going to minimally dispatch the power plant to which this transaction is 
linked through the end of 2001.

To properly reflect the current volumetric levels associated with First Gas, 
we need to take volumes from the 31,000 barrels per day level that was 
originally booked to approximately 6,000 barrels per day for the remainder of 
the deal.

In addition, freight charges related to this deal have doubled since April, 
2000 increasing from the $.70 originally booked to the current $1.45.  Per 
conversations with John Chismar he expects freight to remain at this level 
for the foreseeable future.

To properly reflect the current costs of this deal, we need to increase the 
Dubai spread to which this deal was booked from $2.91 to approximately 
$3.65.  Initial estimates of the loss resulting from both the volumetric and 
cost proposed write-down of First Gas is $30 million.  We are continuing to 
refine this number and will update you when we get a final amount.

On a final note, Arthur Andersen has repeatedly reviewed First Gas throughout 
2000 and to this point we have been able to spin enough of an argument to 
justify delaying a writedown.  Given the current market conditions discussed 
above (which are publicly known), the size of the writedown and the fact that 
their next review will be for year-end earnings, I believe Arthur Andersen is 
going to require us to write down at least a substantial portion of First Gas 
before they will sign-off on earnings.  Obviously, I have not recently 
discussed this with AA&Co. but I do anticipate this being an earnings issue.

Please call me if you wish to discuss further.  I appreciate any help you can 
give us in this matter.

Virginia,

Thanks for the email.  I apologize for the slow response.  Life is crazy and 
I have been back on the road again.

 I am interested in purchasing "Blue Note" and I understand that the price is 
$4,500 framed as before.  I am chasing down another piece, as i think i have 
stated before, but have not closed yet on it.  It is significantly less but I 
have not closed the deal.  I would like to own the piece.  Do you think there 
is any room on the price from your seller?  I will commit to you but I can't 
leave a couple of thousand dollars on the table because of my impatience.  
That being said, i do want it and this one is found and ready to go.  I will 
commit today to purchase the picture in this condition for $3,500.  you can 
tell the seller that I will commit with American Express immediately at that 
price.  I don't know if that works for you or the seller.

Please let me know what you think.  I am in this week.

Thanks and don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.  I am 
ready to make a decision.

Mike

Hi Angie -

Please pass along our thanks for the invitation.  I have confirmed that 
Saturday evening is the only time I will have an opportunity to see my 
brother, therefore I will be unable to attend.  In addition, Mike checked his 
calendar and found out that he and his wife have been committed for several 
weeks to attend a social engagement on that evening.

Again, thanks.

Cathy Phillips and 
Mike McConnell

It is my sincere honor to once again lead the Enron team in this year's 
Juvenile Diabetes Foundation (JDF) walk scheduled to take place on Sunday, 
November 5, 2000, at the Sam Houston Race Park.  I continue to serve on the 
board of JDF representing Enron and will be Enron's corporate executive for 
this year's fundraising efforts.

As many of you may already know, I am an insulin dependent diabetic myself.  
Even though I know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the 
multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day, I cannot 
imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease.  Taking 
insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of 
complications; insulin is simply their life support system and without it 
they would die.

Enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for JDF again this year.  JDF 
is a very efficient organization in which approximately 84% of all money 
raised goes directly to research.  Enron's goal this year is to raise 
$225,000 and we need your help.  Enron has been the number 1 walk team for 5 
years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place!  We need team 
leaders, walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal.  The theme for the 
walk this year is "Knock Out Diabetes" and we would like to have you join us 
for this great event.  The Walk is truly a blast and we had about 500 Enron 
people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it.

If you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader, or if 
you would like to make a pledge, you may call any of the steering committee 
members listed below.  If you are interested in being a team leader, please 
contact one of the following people immediately so that you may be included 
in the first important and informative training session taking place this 
week.

Thank you very much for your support.

Guys,

Attached below is a presentation that I put together for M Frevert for the 
latest analyst presentation.  We kept it to only a few businesses -  they 
didn't end up using any of it.  I do however want to have an EGM presentation 
that everyone can use.  Please prepare a section on each of your businesses 
and return via email or hard copy.  Don't worry about power point, simply the 
dot points that you want on the page.

Thanks,
mike

Kevin,

A quick question before our meeting.  Didn't we have a little different form 
that you used at HPL?  I thought I remembered a little different version of 
the Contract Approval Sheet.  One that had more detail and description of the 
risks.

Thanks,
Mike

Dorie,

Thanks for everything on the Masters trip.  I thought it went very well.

I enjoyed our shirt and sweater gift but i have a question.  I got a large 
sweater and need a medium.  Do you have a medium left?  I brought in the 
large to exchange.

As you may have heard, President Bush signed the Economic Growth and Tax 
Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 into law (the "Law") this morning.  The Law 
reduces personal income tax rates, modifies the AMT and Estate Tax and makes 
several changes to retirement and education savings incentives.  Further, due 
to the reduction in the personal income tax rates (through the creation of a 
new 10 percent tax bracket carved out from the previous 15 percent bracket) 
without a reduction to the Federal withholding tax regime (this regime was 
not altered by the Law), all taxpayers are slated to receive a rebate of 
taxes that otherwise would have been paid this year - this is the $300, 500 
or 600 "tax refund" that you may have heard of in connection with the Law.  
The attached documents describe in greater detail the changes I have just 
described.  As always, I can be reached at x30938 should you have any 
questions.  Best regards.  SHD.

Joe,

Stan Horton has been invited to attend a series of meetings associated with  
INGAA in Tokyo.  I believe that Stan is the Chairman of INGAA.  There are 
some Tokyo companies that are a part of the organization.  Bill Smith, CEO of 
Sonat (now El Paso) and will be talking about LNG and Japanese requirements 
and will be going to Tokyo.  Stan has asked both Sherriff and me if this is 
worth his attendance.  I thought you would be the best answer to that.  I 
also told him that you could represent Enron very well in any meeting in 
Japan. 

Please call Stan at 713 853 6177 and discuss with him.  He can fill you in 
better on the details.  Your call.

Thanks, 
mike

Dan,

Fred has not had much luck with getting attention with this.  This sounds 
like it should be in your (new) group.  Please give Fred a call, I think this 
sounds very interesting and is worth a follow-up.

Subject: Air Cargo Capacity Trading at Enron

Hello Louise:

I recently authored a white paper, giving some background on the air cargo 
business for Enron Net Works.  In the paper, I identified the hurdles we 
would need to overcome in order to create a market for trading air cargo 
capacity futures, none of which were deemed insurmountable.  I further 
suggested that Enron could approach this business by leveraging EOL to act as 
a non vessel owning common carrier, trading physical capacity while readying 
the market (and ourselves!) for financial trading.

I am very interested in moving this business idea along here within Net 
Works.  I have some ideas regarding likely industry partners that could move 
us along rather quickly.  I think the logical next step may be to get with 
you or with someone on your staff to begin some dialog with the eventual goal 
of creating a business plan.  Any thoughts?

Thanks!

John,

Here is a brief email on a possible resolution for the European/Oslo  weather 
situation.  Mark sent this draft to me last weekend but i haven't had time to 
review it this week.  Personally, I think that this is the wrong answer from 
a Corporate perspective but this issue keeps hanging around and isn't worth 
any more of our time.  For what it is worth, I think our communication 
strategy did make a big difference but didn't get us exactly where we needed 
to be.  These groups will be expected (and held accountable) for good and 
consistent communication on an ongoing basis as well.   For a P&L that is 
this small (and negative) we are all spending too much time on this.  There 
is more to this story but I think we should just drop it and move on to 
bigger and better things.

I am certainly not wedded to any of this but would rather focus on all the 
other issues and problems on my plate.  Let's discuss upon your return on our 
weekly call.

Thanks and I hope your vacation was relaxing.

Mike 

ps-this hasn't been shared outside the group on the email.

Subject: European Weather

I propose to structure Weather Risk Management in Europe as follows:
 
I have responsibility and authority for all weather related activities 
including: trading (incl. EOL), structuring, origination, research, etc... 
for all of Europe with the exception of Finland, Norway and Sweeden.  I will 
run Europe out of the London office with people reporting directly to me.  
Accordingly, I will allocate V@R and delegate trading authority to personnel 
in the London office. 

I anticipate having Paul Murray run our activities in London. Janine Juggins 
in the London Tax department is establishing the necessary entities and 
addressing the relevant tax issues.  Simon Thurbin in London who reports to 
Todd Hall is identifying a book administrator for our group.  Cindy Horn 
again in London is securing space for an initial 8 to 10 individuals.  We 
have hired an assistant who is multilingual to assist in the setting up of 
our activities.  We are working with Stuart Reed in Houston IT and Brian 
Hudson in London IT (coordinating with Oslo) to ensure that we have the 
infrastructure necessary to trade weather.

In addition to Paul Murray, Ross McIntyre, and the assistant, Catherine 
Woolgar will return to London.  We have also identified an individual in 
London to provide research support. For sturcturing, we will send one 
individual for the Houston group and hire one new employee already identified.

Paul Murray will focus on the management of the office, relationships within 
Europe and the execution of large structured trades.  All other individuals 
in the London office will have dual reporting with a dotted line to Paul and 
a direct line to the group leaders in Houston to ensure continuity and 
accountability.

With respect to Scandinavia, I propse that those activities be treated as 
completely separate with their own V@R and trading authority.  Their 
activities should be limited only to Scandinavia.  The Houston group will 
share infomation and knowledge in the same way that we would with other desks 
within Enron.  Should any of the groups reporting to me wish to take on a 
Scandinavian position, they will have to do so through the Oslo weather 
group.  Likewise, should the Oslo weather group wish to take any weather 
positions outside of Scandanavian, they will need to do so through me.

Paul Murray and I will develop a new budget for Europe taking into 
consideration the time needed to establish our activities.  Oslo will retain 
responsibility for the European budget as originally proposed by Thor Lien.

FYI

Eastman has announced senior executives for the two new companies. Looks
like Chitwood will no longer be involved, and Rothwell has a new team.

Two senior executives to retire in company split


KINGSPORT, Tenn. (AP) _ Two senior executives will retire as part of a
management restructuring at Eastman Chemical Co. coinciding with the
division of the chemical and plastics giant into two separate companies by
year's end.


Eastman Chairman and CEO Earnest Deavenport Jr. said Tuesday that Dr. James
L. Chitwood and Garland S. Williamson will follow him into retirement on
Dec. 31.


That is the date Eastman Chemical has set for its tax-free spinoff into two
companies _ a specialty chemicals, coatings and adhesives company called
Eastman Co., and a plastics and acetate fibers commodities company yet to
be named.


Chitwood, 58, is senior vice president for corporate strategy and chief
technology officer. Williamson, 57, is senior vice president for worldwide
operations and chief health, safety and environmental officer.


Chitwood has worked for Eastman for 33 years; Williamson for 34 years.
Deavenport cited Chitwood's contributions to research and development and
Williamson's efforts to reduce costs.


"We very much appreciate the contributions these two executives have made
to Eastman," Deavenport said.


Brian Ferguson, who will head the new Eastman Co., said his management team
will include: Betty DeVinney, 56, senior vice president for human resources
and communications; Theresa Lee, 48, senior vice president and general
counsel; Roger Mowen, 55, senior vice president for e-commerce and
marketing, and James Rogers, 50, chief operating and financial officer.


Allan Rothwell, who be CEO of the new plastics spinoff, said David Cotey,
44, will be vice president and general counsel; Richard Johnson, 52, group
vice president for fibers; Fielding Rolston, 60, senior vice president of
human resources; Thomas Smith, 57, group vice president for plastics, and
Albert Wargo, 47, vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer.


Based in Kingsport, Eastman has about 15,000 employees in 30 countries and
2000 sales of $5.3 billion.


Its stock price closed on the New York Stock Exchange at $51.17 Tuesday, up
38 cents.

Subject: Juvenile Diabetes Foundation

I wanted to give you an update on my progress in EES with the JDF - - - -as 
of this afternoon, I have collected (with Enron matching) $4,600.  

This is the letter I sent to my solicitation list last week - .....  Pretty 
good for one week, right?

Good afternoon.

My 17 year old son has had diabetes since he was 2 years old.  Imagine this - 
as of today, Austin has taken more than 16,425 shots and more than 27,300 
finger sticks.  It never gets easier for him and it will never go away until 
a cure is found.   Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure, adult 
blindness and non-traumatic amputations, a leading cause of nerve damage, 
heart attack and stroke.  Until a cure is found, his health is better today 
than it will be tomorrow. 

Please let me know if I can count on you to walk with me or help raise funds 
for Juvenile Diabetes.  84% of the money raised goes directly to diabetes 
research.   My commitment to you is this - walk with me - I guarantee you a 
morning of fun, good times and the opportunity to meet a large, dynamic group 
of people committed to finding a cure.  Sponsor me - you will help millions 
of kids like mine that are desperately looking for a cure.  

The walk is on Sunday, November 5, 9:00 AM - 4.5 miles at Sam Houston Race 
Park.   If you cannot join in the walk but want to help monetarily, please 
send your check payable to the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation (JDF) to my 
attention - 1400 Smith Street, EB 760 / Houston, Tx 
77002.                                                                        
                                                   

>From the bottom of my heart, I thank you.    My son and millions of other 
kids with diabetes thank you as well.

Emilo,

Thanks for the information.  Let me know if there is anything else I can do.

I know that Neal Gerstandt just joined the company last week and will be 
working with you on project Jose.  You will find him to be a great guy and a 
person with excellent judgment and overall experience in the energy 
industry.  I have known and worked with Neal for over 10 years.  I think he 
will make a great addition to the team and help bring this deal home.... the 
largest deal at Enron.

Mike

to invite you as an important business leader and give you an update on our 
businesses and also have you share your vision and accomplishments of your 
great work in Norway.  We intended to only invite 3 non-EGM officers, Joe 
Hirl, Paul Quilkey and you.  

I hope you have a great holiday.

second week of November early enough for your briefing or should we try to

I was in Spain with the Credit Department to receive a list of assets and 
supporting
documentation from GMP that they were to prepare to convince Enron the 
company had a 
chance to make it through its present difficulties.  The overall situation is 
that this business
has ground to a halt.  They are a distribution company without any supplies 
or suppliers
willing to supply them on open credit and no bank lines.   Thus they are 
making no sales
and have no cash coming into the business.  They are owed 12 mil dollars 
presently from 
their customers for previous deliveries.  They are unlikely to recover this 
outstanding
receivable without a resumption of deliveries.

The above reflects the situation that we were working with GMP to improve 
with the 
thought that their outstanding debt was appx 30 million dollars.  The 
situation this week
we found out was considerably worse.  They disclosed that they had not paid 
the 
Spanish tax authorities since September the vat taxes they collect on the 
government
behalf.  25 mil usd is the amount of overdue taxes and that number will 
continue to increase
depending on the rate of interest they are charged and the penalties imposed 
upon them
for their default.  Given the debt is to the tax authorities this poses 
further difficulties.  The 
tax authorities have preferential rights over all other creditors  There is 
no time bar that
limits the time period that the courts can look back to quantify when a 
company became
effectively bankrupt can be absolved as not legitimate.  The payments we 
received since
September (50 million) could therefore be viewed by the courts as money that 
should have
been paid by GMP to other creditors.  Looking through the records some of 
this payments
were for cargoes being delivered in that time (appx 18 mil) but the majority 
(32 mil) was
the paying down of previous debt.

Our existing debt situation is as follows:

5 mil unsecured debt on oil sold to GMP

13 mil unsecured debt on mark to market exposure.  Four vessels were 
delivered over
November and December by Enron to Ectric Spain that priced to GMP over the 
month
of delivery.  GMP was to prepay this oil to Enron as they lifted the 
product.  We entered
this arrangement to try and keep them operating and also allow them to meet 
their
strategic stock requirements.

Our risks under a claw back by the courts for preferential payment while GMP 
insolvent:

20 million in strategic stocks (this oil was initially sold by Enron to GMP 
and then the title
was passed by GMP to Ectric Spain when GMP was in default on the payment).   
Concern
here being that if the courts declared GMP bankrupt at the time that the 
title was transferred
that transaction could be declared null and void.  Enron would have to 
liquidate the physical
oil and the proceeds divided amongst all the creditors.

?? million on money received by Enron in preference to the other creditors.  
The main 
concern here is the 25 million owed to the tax authorities.  The debt of the 
other suppliers
and banks is as follows:

veba 15 mil.  total 3 mil.  vitol 1 mil.  deutche bank 10 mil.  we don't feel 
that there is a
significant case of preferential treatment to us vs these other suppliers.

Actions we are taking going forward.  

1) Speaking with Veba about insisting on a professional liquidation 
practitioner being hired
as a precondition for any further support.  

2) We are in the process of selling all the oil that we hold in Spain.  We 
want to eliminate the
possibility of the courts putting a freeze on the oil we have in Spain in the 
event of bankruptcy.

We will continue to pressure this company to refinance their company.   In 
March 2000 we 
conducted a detailed review of their books and they were worth 5 mil usd.  We 
don't believe
that the business has lost money anywhere near the level of present 
indebtedness and actually
would have expected 2000 to have been a profitable business environment for 
them.  Thus,
it is our conclusion that they have been taking money out of the company. 

I will update you further on what if any assets they do bring forward to 
improve this outlook.
David/Robert please add in where you feel I've left out anything important.

Thanks, 

Chris.

I understand that you will be meeting with Dale Lawrence and Casey Olson from 
Oxy on Thursday, and that Terry will be briefing you on the Saudi project 
opportunities first thing Thursday am and will be participating with you in 
the meeting.

After re-reading the Saudi proposals today, I offer the following thoughts 
and suggestions for your meeting.  Terry can fill you in on more details.

Background

The Saudi Gas initiative was kicked off by the Crown Prince during a visit to 
the US in the fall of 1999.  The intent was to encourage foreign investors to 
bring capital and technology into the country to build a privatized gas, 
power and water infrastructure system and to create jobs and investment 
opportunities for Saudis.  The initiative is being led by the Foreign 
Minister because the Crown Prince is aware of resistance from Aramco, the Oil 
Ministry, Saudi Electric Co and Saudi Water Co.  In spite of continuing 
resistance from these very powerful groups, the initiative is moving forward 
essentially on schedule.

When the initiative was first announced, Enron tried to get onto the 
shortlist but was told that we would not qualify because we did not have 
adequate international upstream expertise.  At the same time, Oxy tried to 
get onto the shortlist but was told that they did not have adequate 
downstream/infrastructure expertise.  Oxy approached us to form a 
partnership, which we did in good faith but with no written agreement.  We 
still have not signed an agreement with Oxy, but we have traded many drafts 
and are within days of executing an agreed MOU.  We have been working 
together in good faith on orally agreed terms consistent with the draft MOU.

Oxy and Enron are a good fit because Oxy shares many of the Enron values 
(urgency, bottom-line focus, objective is money, not necessarily booked 
reserves, etc.)  Oxy has made it clear that they are primarily interested in 
upstream investment in Saudi and we have made it clear that we are not 
interested in upstream investment.  Oxy understands the recent changes in 
philosophy in Enron and is ok with this, but at the same time they are 
worried that we may not want to put any capital in Saudi and thus could 
jeopardize Oxy's competitiveness in the upcoming beauty pageant.

Oxy maintains that throughout the process, Dr. Irani's personal friendship 
with the Saudi Foreign Minister has been a big driving force in moving our 
proposals forward.  There is probably some truth to this.  However, at the 
same time, it is clear to both Oxy and to Enron that the Saudi bureaucracy is 
more intrigued with Enron than with Oxy and want to find a role for us.  
Since all of our presentations to the Saudis have been joint Oxy/Enron 
presentations, the Saudis view us as linked together. 

This is a huge deal for Oxy and the dream of a lifetime for Irani.  They are 
afraid that if Enron drops out (which we have the clear right to do), the 
Saudis may disqualify Oxy.  I believe that their fears are justified----I 
can't imagine the Saudis allowing Oxy to proceed alone without Enron.


Proposed Way Forward

We and Oxy have been shortlisted, along with several other oil companies for 
two projects:

-Core Project 2, which is an E & P opportunity on the Red Sea coast near 
Jordan, combined with a gas/liquids processing plant, a pipeline, a potential 
power/water plant and a potential petrochemicals facility.  The market area 
on the Red Sea coast has huge growth potential.

-Core Project 3, which is an E & P opportunity in SE Saudi near the UAE 
border, combined with a pipeline to eastern Saudi, a liquids plant, and 
several potential downstream facilities.  There is the potential to export 
this gas to the UAE/Dolphin, but it is a long shot.

Terry can give you details on both of these proposed projects.

Each of these projects will require several billion dollars of capital and 
they each have large upstream components.  The marketing network potential 
(both within Saudi and internationally) is huge, but the dilemma is to carve 
out a role for Enron that fits with our corporate philosophy.

I understand that Dale Lawrence has proposed to you that we tell the Saudis 
that Oxy/Enron want to proceed as joint partners and then settle up "behind 
the veil" such that the upstream capital and risk are Oxy responsibilities.  
I don't like this approach because the press won't see beyond the veil and 
will report it as Enron being a 50/50 partner in one or two $4 billion deals 
in Saudi.

On the other hand, I want to be in these projects because the potential in 
Saudi is huge and the EGM spin-offs (liquids, etc.) could also be huge.  I 
believe that there is a simple way to address both our needs and Oxy's needs.

 The Saudi proposals break both Core Project 2 and Core Project 3 into two 
pieces:

-an upstream E & P and gas processing venture, under a traditional PSC 
arrangement with Aramco as the controlling partner and the foreign partner as 
operator, and

-various downstream pipeline, power, water and potentially distribution 
companies in which Aramco will not be a participant, but that other Saudi 
investors may want a piece of.  These downstream ventures will buy gas from 
the upstream ventures and will be subject to pipeline and privatisation 
regulatory regimes that have not yet been invented.

I suggest that we propose to the Saudis that Enron and Oxy will be working as 
partners, but that Oxy will be the sole investor and operator for all 
upstream components.  Enron, on the other hand, will undertake to be the 
developer and operator for the pipelines and downstream facilities, but will 
structure such projects as opportunities for various  Saudi investors 
supported by Project financing and with IPO's as soon as possible.  In 
structuring such projects, Enron would work with the Saudi government to 
develop appropriate regulatory regimes.   Enron, as developer and operator, 
would forego the right to any equity in such projects in order to maximize 
the investment opportunities for Saudis but would instead cover its 
development costs and earn a profit via operating and development fees to the 
downstream ventures and success fees at financial close and/or other 
milestones.

This approach would give Oxy the hard capital investment in Saudi that they 
want, while giving Enron the opportunity to earn a return on intellectual 
capital.  It would give us the chance that we want for a dialogue with the 
Saudis to define the basis for a robust market-oriented system----similar to 
the opportunity that Enron Japan hopes to develop through working with the 
Japanese government.  It would also give us an on the ground relationship 
with government authorities that control policies for the export and 
marketing of Saudi's crudes and liquids.  We could also offer to be the 
exporter/offtaker for any liquids produced by Oxy.

Terry and Rob are going to kick this around a bit tonight and may have a more 
well thought out approach by Thursday, but I wanted to get these basic 
thoughts to you to give you, Terry and Rob some food for thought.

Mark,

Thanks for the updates.  I have big news;  I'm changing jobs.  This is not 
announced yet but I am moving to the wholesale group with Frevert to become 
CEO for a new business unit called Enron Global Markets.  It will contain the 
global commodities including Crude and products, coal, LNG, weather, 
insurance, FX/interest rates/equities, etc.  

 I think MEC is very cool and i am glad we are pursing it.  Please keep 
Philippe, Jay and now Jeff McMahon in the loop.

Good luck with this and I look forward to hearing more about it's success.  
Please keep this news to yourself until next week.

Thanks,
Mike

Steve,

I spoke with David ealier today.  He is planning a meeting with Jim Tour to 
due diligence the technology.  

I would like to put together a team to drive MEC's strategy, including a 
consolidation in Houston.  We would trade this commitment for warrants in the 
company and a right to participate in future fundings.  Effectively, our team 
could help drive the strategy for the company and due diligence a possible 
investment at the same time.

Thanks,

I think it would be useful to verify their view that they are really only 2-3 
years from commercial production.  Ideally, we could get that confirmation 
from someone familiar with the technology but without any financial interest 
in its success.  Their technology pitch sounded good, but I don't know enough 
to recognize the potential shortcomings.  I want to feel comfortable that you 
all feel this is real, then I would be happy to have me and my team spend 
some time with them.

Thank you for participating in yesterday's meeting.  We spoke with Harvey and 
Jim after the meeting and they took to speed to market comments to heart.  
There is an opportunity for Enron to participate with MEC in the early 
development of their company, but it seems the one thing they want is the one 
thing we also want, people.  I would appreciate your thoughts and comments on 
the possiblity of creating a small team that could work directly with MEC as 
part of a potential investment and strategic relationship.  Given our 
resource constraints, this would most likely be part of the organization that 
sees the greatest strategic impact from MEC's development.

Jeff/Mike,

I understand there is some concern regarding the take-or-pay exposure under 
the LNG contracts between DPC and Oman LNG and Adgas. First, there is no 
direct Enron Corp exposure. Both contracts are between DPC and the related 
supplier. There are no Corp performance guarantees in either SPA. Attached is 
a memo sent to Jim Hughes last month outlining the contractural obligations 
and current discussions with the suppliers.

>From a practical standpoint both suppliers will work with us to reschedule 
the start dates and to modify the fixed quantities. I  met with both 
suppliers before the holidays and they reconfirmed they will work with Enron 
as they understand the problems in India. We have delayed the contractural 
start date under  both contracts to the maximum extent possible: February 11, 
2002 for Oman and April 30, 2002 for Adgas. What this means contracturally is 
more than a year to work with the suppliers. Both suppliers expect an update 
on DPC when I return to the Middle East next week and both do not expect to 
discuss any contract matters until the situation in India is clearer. I will  
be in New Mexico through tomorrow if you want to discuss further. My phone 
number is 505/336-8400.

Michael, I have the following comments to the Nodocero.com project.

Currently works as a platform where buyers and sellers agree on a price 
through an auction process (brokerage fee)
They aim at becoming a regulated market with standardised contracts. (subject 
to market and regulatory evolution)
Their value drivers are the "Payment Guarantee" (through an insurance 
company) and "Backoffice" (registration before regulatory authorities). None 
of these issues are definitely solved (no agreement with Insurance Co. and if 
any transaction is done now, all the backoffice procedures have to be done 
manually with their employees).
No technological partner yet. They have developed the web site platform (you 
can see it at www.nodocero.com), but I understand that they don't have the 
rest of the technological components required (database, operations, clearing 
system, other). 

Apart from this, I would consider the following issues:

Currently there is no regulated market for this sector of the economy 
(Argentina and the rest of Latin America). Therefore their idea of becoming 
one is good.
The competitors in this race are: Nodocero.com - aXesoEnergia.com - 
EnergyVex.com - Rofex (Rosario Futures Exchange) - other.
No competitor has yet taken an important lead in this race. aXesoEnergia.com 
is doing an important investment in marketing, but it currently works via an 
auction process and does not provide any further service like guarantee or 
backoffice.
One of the competitors will eventually succeed in becoming the reference 
market.
Nodocero.com has no strategic partner yet. (this could be taken as positive 
or negative)

The attached file is their business plan

John,

Below is a response from Richard Harper.  A couple of interesting thoughts.  
Richard would be a great source for running ideas by and/or  testing 
concepts.  He is brilliant on this.
Just a thought.

Subject: Re: J-Block  

I have not been involved, but only last week a little bird told me that they 
have severe problems with reserve levels and expect to decline in 2002, when 
we were talking it was 2004 and then only by a small amount.  Agip is 
particularly adversely effected (as Agip in particular lacks reserves in the 
area).  I understand the development of Jade by BG and Phillips and the 
squeeze down of Texaco and OMV, the other Jade owners, by Agip  to sell their 
gas to Agip was driven by this lack of reserves.

You will recall that liquidated damages was a big issue they wanted to retain 
them rather than actual damages and we insisted that they remained at the 
same absolute level as in the old agreement, so I believe they are 40% of the 
new price (my memory is fading also).  I do recall that they all insisted 
that they would deliver the gas.  However, as with most companies the players 
have all moved on and a contract is a contract, afterall this was our 
approach.  Also I am sure they intended to maximise production from J-Block 
and did not forsee a shortage of production.

 It would be interesting to know if this is an agreed policy by them or 
whether one of the sellers is blocking the NBP sale by refusing to 
co-operate, they could do this because of the Common Stream Agreement.  
Presumably they have not yet split the 3 agreements yet.

As to opportunity if they are short of reserves, perhaps they can buy 
themselves out of the situation, especially while the contract is in the

Richard,
 Hello from South America.  I am forwarding this email from John regarding 
the J-Block problems.  Have you been involved in this?  What are your 
thoughts?  If you have any ideas or can provide with some help, please 
follow-up.  This is confidential but i thought you could help.  When he 
mentioned this, I really couldn't remember much.  Amazing how the memory 
fades on some of the details in just a few years.

I mentioned on our conference call on Monday that J-Block has had problems 
meeting our nominations from the Judy/Joanne/Janice reservoirs.

Up until recent CATS maintenance shutdown on 15 May, they were making up for 
reduced production volumes by nominating to supply gas at the NBP which they 
are entitled but not obliged to do.  Since return from outage at the end of 
May they have declined to nominate at the NBP.  

>From 1 January to 15 May, the Sellers use of the NBP delivery option kept 
underdeliveries to 350 mmcf (ie one day's maximum quantity) in total.  Since 
returning from the maintenance shutdown, underdeliveries have totalled 850 
mmcf ( averaging 77mcf/d ).

We believe that following the sharp rise in market prices during the 
maintenance period, they have decided to default on the contract rather than 
make up deliveries from other sources.   They have an effective cap on the 
penalties of about 5 pence per therm (after taking into account the value of 
the liquids) and therefore they are not making up the volumes when the daily 
price is substantially higher than about 16 pence per therm.

Prior to the CATS shutdown, we had made them a proposal to enable them to 
deliver additional volumes at  another alternative to avoid default but they 
have not responded yet.

You mentioned that in your negotiations with Phillips they had committed to 
getting us all the gas regardless of the cap on the penalties.  This has cost 
us about $1.5 million to date and they seem to be institutionalising their 
non performance.    Perhaps a phone call by you might help.  

By the way I will be in Houston on Thursday and Friday to meet with the 
delegation from Croatia and I will probably be tied up the entire time but if 
you need me
for a phone call I can break away.

I agree that George is well suited to origination, but he has also spent 
quite a bit of time looking at investment opportunities for Koch in a wide 
variety of industries that they are active in. If EGM is looking at several 
acquisitions, I could see him being the point person for EGM on transactions 
and thus able to relieve some of the burden on the folks focusing on trading. 
However, I know that George is happy at Koch, so it would have to take a very 
exciting opportunity for him to leave, i.e., something where he would feel 
the job was "tailor made" for his skill set. Maybe we don't have something 
like that for him right now.

Subject: Resumes from George Damiris and Randy Balhorn

 Mike:

 I finally got George Damiris' resume (attached) as well as that of Randy 
Balhorn (also attached). I think when you read Randy's CV, you will be very 
impressed. I would go so far as to say that he was the smartest person I knew 
at Koch, and when you see the list of accomplishments that he had there, as 
well as what he was doing with Dreyfuss and Electricite de France, you will 
agree with me that he would be a terrific addition to Enron Global Markets. 
The even better news regarding Randy is that he recently left Dreyfuss due to 
issues with the EDF JV, so he is available immediately and he is very 
interested. He currently lives in London and I think that he knows Joe Gold. 
Please let me know if you would like me to do anything to help facilitate 
this further.  I think George is interested if there was a specific 
opportunity for him here that he felt was an even better fit than what he is 
doing with Koch. The fact that he is moving to Houston makes it pretty easy 
for us to keep having discussions with him. I would say, however, if I had to 
choose which among the two of them would have the most immediate impact if 
hired by Enron, it would have to be Randy, given his experience.

Thanks,

Basil

Kansas City will be great.  Thanks for the invite but I can't go.  I pray 
that the Nebr. Sooners show up,  not the Sooners of the last 3 weeks.  We 
really look awful.  Early peak?

That's great news for spring break.  Let me talk to the boss and let her know

Thanks,

Go Sooners.  Shame about Hipel, he has thrown away his Heisman over the last

Speaking of great to be back... we are heading to Kansas City on Saturday.
If O.U. plays in the National Title game we are going to try to go.  Any
interest? I can probably come up with some tickets.

Spring Break for us is also the 12th - 16th.  We have not made any other
plans.  Lets ski in Telluride.

Continental fly's direct from Houston to Montrose, but the flights book
pretty early.  I just checked and there are two flights per day and seats
are available. Let me know if you need help with your travel plans.  We will
go up on Friday the 9th and return on Sunday the 18th so whatever schedule
you can make is great.  We will have you picked up at the airport, no
problem.

Pelt,

Howdy from Houston.  I hope you had a great Thanksgiving.  I took the week
off and it was what i needed.  I have been working at a hectic pace and was
on my annual sick rotation, although a little earlier than normal.  I
needed the break.  My international traveling is over for the year, thank
God.

Chris and i were talking about life and vacations and spring break came up.
I thought i would send you our information and see if our breaks
co-ordinated and to see if we still wanted to try and get together to go
skiing.  We didn't know if you made other plans or moved on since our last
discussion a while ago.  Our spring break is March 12-16th .

Please let give an update via email when you get a chance.  I figured that
you are in Telluride right now on holiday.

Give my love to all.

Mike



PS - How about those Sooners!  OU/TX wasn't a fluke. Hard to believe, we'll
see what will happen with K State and bowls.  No matter, its been a fun
year.  It is nice to be back.

Mike,
The Enron's Global Asset Management Conference committee would like to invite 
you to speak on Enron's ebusiness strategy for this conference which is being 
held at the Woodlands Conference Center on October 8-11.  We would like to 
have you present on October 10, from 9:00-10:00 AM.  
The conference committee has chosen the One Enron theme since the attendees 
at the conference are coming from all the Enron business units both 
domestically and internationally. The estimated attendance at the conference 
will be 225 Enron and Joint Venture employees.  The invitations are being 
issued enterprise-wide to employees who are engaged in 
operations/maintenance/purchasing.  This conference is the expansion of the 
annual plant managers' conference that is held each year in Houston.  We are 
replacing it with what we will be a "Best in Class" conference addressing 
multiple topics that will provide direction that will result in lower costs, 
increased earnings and employee retention.  We will also be utilizing this 
conference as an additional mentoring activity for our Minority/Women 
Business Enterprise suppliers.
I hope that you will accept our invitation, because I know many of the 
participates are very interested in learning more about what Enron's 
ecommerce strategy.

An agenda has been attached for your review, however it is still in 
development.

I have not been involved, but only last week a little bird told me that they 
have severe problems with reserve levels and expect to decline in 2002, when 
we were talking it was 2004 and then only by a small amount.  Agip is 
particularly adversely effected (as Agip in particular lacks reserves in the 
area).  I understand the development of Jade by BG and Phillips and the 
squeeze down of Texaco and OMV, the other Jade owners, by Agip  to sell their 
gas to Agip was driven by this lack of reserves.

You will recall that liquidated damages was a big issue they wanted to retain 
them rather than actual damages and we insisted that they remained at the 
same absolute level as in the old agreement, so I believe they are 40% of the 
new price (my memory is fading also).  I do recall that they all insisted 
that they would deliver the gas.  However, as with most companies the players 
have all moved on and a contract is a contract, afterall this was our 
approach.  Also I am sure they intended to maximise production from J-Block 
and did not forsee a shortage of production.

 It would be interesting to know if this is an agreed policy by them or 
whether one of the sellers is blocking the NBP sale by refusing to 
co-operate, they could do this because of the Common Stream Agreement.  
Presumably they have not yet split the 3 agreements yet.

As to opportunity if they are short of reserves, perhaps they can buy 
themselves out of the situation, especially while the contract is in the 
money.

With my adversarial hat on perhaps BG want revenge for their loss in the 
appeal courts?   This is probably nearest to the truth.

I'm afraid this isn't much help and I do not recall any willful default 
provisions in the agreement.

Sally,

Thanks for the email and update.  I agree that we must do something quickly 
to resolve this.  I believe that you should interview for summer interns as 
an extension to your upcoming planned recruiting trip.  I know you were very 
happy with the summer interns from the energy management program at OU that 
you got last year ( I was surprised and the school was thrilled  that you 
offered all 5 permanent positions upon graduation).   We cant lose that 
momentum.  I am sure that each school's program is different and that most 
don't interview for summer interns this early in the year but from what I 
have learned about the OU schedule, we will lose all the top candidates if we 
wait.  I am sure that is not what Charlene and Celeste were trying to 
accomplish with their guidelines.

Please keep me up informed on this matter.

Thanks and good luck with the students.

Subject: Hiring Practices for Summer Interns


While recruiting on campus recently I became aware that a decision was made 
at the Program level to not interview this fall for 2001 summer interns.  In 
talking with students and faculty at The University of Texas and University 
of Oklahoma, it became clear that there is concern over the feasibility of an 
internship with Enron, as other top firms will be recruiting this fall for 
summer 2001 interns.  I have communicated my concerns to Lexi Elliott and her 
manager, Shelley Jones, and was told by both that the decision to delay 
interviews for summer interns was made at a Program level based on Enron's 
staffing.  When I asked about the competitive data available regarding the 
practice of other firms on summer intern interviews, I was even more 
concerned to discover that neither Lexi nor Shelley had that data.  It would 
seem critical to know what the competition is doing in terms of summer intern 
interview schedules in order to understand the risk that could be created for 
Enron by not interviewing this fall for these important feeder positions for 
our Analyst and Associates programs.  

I have had conversations over the last two weeks with Lexi and Shelley, with 
no resolution.  When they could not provide the competitive data to either 
confirm or eliminate my concerns, I volunteered to have James Scribner, a  
Senior Director on my team, obtain this market information.  Lexi and Shelley 
either did not have the time to gather this data, or were not sure how to do 
so.  They were pleased to have some help in getting our hands on this 
critical information.  I now have information at hand with regard to firms 
that will be recruiting at UT and OU this fall for summer intern positions.   
And based on this information, I believe that Enron is at risk for not hiring 
top students as interns for the summer of 2001 if we do not interview for 
these positions this fall.  

While my research only touches on two of the schools at which Enron recruits, 
I want to raise concern over this as a potential problem at many, if not all 
campuses that we have targeted for recruiting.    As administrators of the 
program, you rely on the involvement of senior members of the company to 
carry the Enron message to campus.  I believe that we also have an obligation 
to make this a two-way messaging system.  I strongly believe that we must 
address this potential risk for Enron extremely quickly, as teams will be on 
campuses across the country to conduct interviews in a matter of days.  I 
suspect that many Enron participants in the recruiting process are unaware of 
the Program's decision regarding the timing of interviews for summer 
internships.  In working with Rick Causey and Mike McConnell, executive 
sponsors for UT and OU, respectively, they are as concerned as I about the 
decision on interviewing summer interns.  I have copied both of them on this 
note to the two of you. 

Please let me know how this can be resolved.  With the help of James Scribner 
and others, we have already compiled a list of students at UT and OU that 
should be targeted for summer internships.  I will offer as much of my time 
as is feasible to work with staff members of the Program to devise creative 
ways to turn this around.

Anuj is a great guy who worked for me then left (as they all do!) to work for 
a dot com.  The business has folded and now he's looking to get back into 
Enron in a structuring role.  He's a real smart guy with an MBA from Harvard 
and a petroleum engineering background.  He worked for the Global Investments 
group of EI before coming over to broadband.  I think he would be a dynamite 
structuring guy, or could help out in the upstream side of the petroleum 
business.  Do any of you have a need?  Rich

Enclosed are the revised DASHES for the two Allegheny Deals.  These are very 
similar to what has already circulated.   The relevant differences between 
this version and the previous version are 1) Exclusion of June from Coverage 
, 2) Lower system strike price (set at ATM at deal closing close)  3) Total 
package price dropped from 6.75MM to 5.25MM, 4) Lower mean losses and lower 
P99.

Any questions, please call me at 212.702.3921.

Hello Kevin,

My name is Joseph Mathew and I used to work with Enron from 1996-1999, where
I was last a commercial Director as of 1998.  I was asked to contact you
directly by my friend Abrar Sait, whom with I am sure you are acquainted.

I am currently a Vice President and Senior Officer of Chematch.com, a
Houston-based online bulk petrochemical, polymer and fuel products trading
exchange.  We founded the firm over one year ago, and things have been going
quite well.

However, the landscape for our business model, industry market penetration,
as well as increased competition has eroded the chance for strong revenue
success of this company, and I wish to return to Enron, but staying within
the dynamic, challenging high-tech areas, such as Broadband Services.

My responsibilities here at Chematch.com have been multiple-fold.  I have
been directly responsible for the creation of the business strategy/plan
(and its changes), the pro-forma financial statements and projections that
permutate with the strategy, key strategic alliances with best of breed
industry participants, venture capital raising process for 3 Series of
funding, the Investment Banking presentations/diligence/IPO work, and
currently head up Petrochem.net, the sister company within Chematch.com.

Prior to joining Enron, I graduated from the University of Chicago with a
Master of Business Administration in Analytic Finance and Accounting.  Prior
to b-school, I worked on Wall Street for 3 1/2 years in investment banking
and capital markets.

Attached is a copy of my resume.  It could be a bit more detailed, but I
prefer to keep it lean as it is easier to read, and I can always talk it
through in detail.

My goal is to procure a challenging leadership position within a business
developement role, such as Mergers & Acquisition, Venture Capital, or
liasing between deal structuring and commercial marketers.

Please review my resume when you get a chance.  I appreciate that you are
very busy, but I would very much appreciate hearing back from you if you see
a fit between what I can offer and what your company is doing.

Best Regards,

Joseph P. Mathew

Good Morning Mike!

The next issue of our newsletter is in the works, with a planned distribution 
set for late June. Mark Frevert has requested that the Executive Letter be 
rotated among the presidents of EWS. This is the inside cover message and 
should be 300+ words. I hope that you will be able to squeeze this into your 
busy schedule.

Here is a suggested outline.  If you want to fill in the outline with 
information, I will be happy to turn it into a letter for you.

 I.  An overview of EWS/EGM as we move forward.

 II. A short-term retrospective about EGM activities and successes

           III. Future plans/initiatives for EGM
     (strategic vision of the group, opportunities, expectations, etc.) 

Please feel free to modify as you see fit.  I have attached Greg Whalley's 
letter from our last issue to give you an idea of the format. Let me know if 
there is anything I can do to help you.  I need your letter by June 15, if 
possible.

 
Hope to hear from you soon.

I will be happy to talk to Keith about this, but I am not ready to put Enron 
employees in harm's way in Gaza.  The situation is still very unstable and 
until there is a clear sign that the Palestineans and Israelis are willing 
and able to control the violence, as evidenced by clear government statements 
and a reasonable period of time with zero violent incidents, we are not going 
back.

I am advising Mike McConnell of my position on this via voicemail and via 
copy of this email.  I will let you know if he wants to do anything different 
from what I have outlined above.

Thanks

Rick,

I'm sure that you are aware that Larry Izzo announced his retirement 
effective 1 Feb.  As a result EE&CC and NEPCO now report directly to Dan Leff 
in Global Energy Services, EES.  I am working with Dan  and Keith Dodson to 
move all of the construction actions forward.

Gaza Project:  My contacts in DC indicate that the situation in Gaza will 
probably remain much the same for the next 12 months.  As such it would 
appear that we have two general options: 1.)  Do nothing and maintain 
care-taker status of the construction site; or 2.)  Conduct a partial 
mobilization as discussed below in paragraphs 3 & 4 and move the project 
forward.  Have asked Keith to give you a call to discuss same.

Dear Dan,

1. Following the intervention of the US Ambassador with Gov't of Israel 
(GOI)  which we requested on behalf of the Owner,  we were able to lift the 
Israeli embargo on sending plant goods to the site in Gaza.  We have brought 
to the site 30 trailers this month. All in-gauge equipment in now onsite.

2. We got the restrictions on the import of aggregate to Gaza lifted,  and we 
can now stockpile it to finish civil works.

3. I am heading back to TA to work on getting approvals to bring the out -of- 
gauge equipment (GTs, STs, Transformers, condensers,etc.) to the site. This 
requires the use of Israeli convoys, cranes, and personnel (truck drivers, 
operators)  which is very difficult  because the Israelis would not want to 
entrust the safety of their citizens to  Palestinian forces. We'll suggest as 
an alternative the use of Jordanian and /or Egyptian trucks, cranes, and 
personnel and see if the Israelis will go for it. (Jordan and Egypt are the 
only Arab countries that have signed peace with Israel.) Or, the use of 
Israeli equipment and Israeli Arab personnel.

3. We directed AP today at the London mtg to submit a partial resumption of 
work program to a) finish civil works, b) do as much electromechanical work 
as possible with the recently arrived materials, and c) achieve mechanical 
completion of GT 1 and 2. We also told them that in restaffing they should 
assume that the current situation of intermittent violence will continue for 
perhaps one year, and to send construction and startup personnel willing to 
work in such circumstances.

4. We recommended to Enron Middle East (EME) obtaining corporate approval ( 
from Enron Global Markets and Enron Corp) to send the OE Arabic speaking 
engineers (Egyptian and Palestinian engineers) back to Gaza once AP is ready 
to return. If Enron does not approve the return of the 2 expats (site mgr and 
startup mgr), then we may have to a) transfer them to the payroll of the 
Palestinian partners at PEC, or b) replace them with Arabic speaking mgrs to 
be hired and placed on our payroll. Omar Aboudaher of EME will be briefing 
Bergsieker in Dubai.

I presented this info at the project review teleconference today, and I am 
copying some of the attendees for ease of access to these details.

Best regards,

Ed Husami

Hi Mike.  The tournament was great to watch on tv, so it must have been
terrific to be there.  I feel badly for Duval.  He played his heart out and
Tiger gave him an opening, but he just couldn't convert.  I will definitely
let you know when I am next in Houston; it would be fun to hit the links
again together.  Similarly, if you are in New York and have some extra time,
please let me know.

The Masters was great and of course you were right, the course was
magnificent.  This is my 4th trip down and I'm going to try and not ever
miss the tournament (but of course I haven't played it!).  The azaleas were
not at max bloom, i think they were about a week away due to the cooler
weather.  What a great tournament.

Please give me a call next time you are in Houston and I'll set up a game
at Champions.  I am looking forward to the tour championship later this
year.

Give my best to Jennifer and Chris says hello.

Chris would like to email Jennifer, would you please send back your home

december 31st.
(This is subject to tuning from GM finance after they make cashflow 
projections).

GM will sign :
Enron Managing Directorship of ECTRIC Spain
Notarized transfer of deeds on the 93.000 MT strategic inventories, and 
ECTRIC will take direct storage contract with terminals.
(This will secure the title of strategic inventories, and at the same time 
eliminate the derived risk on hedge)

ECTRIC Spain will function with a working committee of 4 (2 Enron,2 GM), 
Enron leaves GM the domestic downstream contacts but control finance and 
imports into Spain.

Signature should take place in Barcelona wednesday, would like to have 
meeting today pm to go over documents and get Finance, Legal, Tax approval.
Thank you

Subject: Re: follow-up to EBR  

Just to give you an example of the requests that came up one day last week 
within Enron directed to me.

1) The Panama office (EGE-MINSA) called with budget help and need forward 
Panama Parity prices for Bunker C and MDO for the next 15 months. There is no 
forward Panama Parity market, but we have been able to produce a forward 
curve by updating the historical PP prices. This process helps the Panama 
City office be able to deal with the local regulators and get dispatched 
more. 
2) Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico called and needed historical NYMEX NX3 natural 
gas prices back to 1993 due to a dispute with their power purchaser because 
their contract is poorly written. Knowledge of these numbers will help them 
make a better case with their customer. 
3) The Buenos Aires office called and needed help with their EOL rollout and 
hedge prices tied to NYMEX crude for a crude producer in Argentina.
4) The Guatemala office (PQPC) called with a sulfur issue on the latest cargo 
delivery. This lead to numerous discussions with the independent inspectors 
and fuel supplier. The issue is of particular importance at PQPC because of 
the recent financing of the project and the scrutiny regarding the emissions 
at the plant. 
5) Mariella Mahan's group called looking for help on physical and financial 
resid into Nicaragua regarding their bid/negotiation with ENEL on the 
privatization of some power plants in Nicaragua. The plants currently buy 
from Esso and we hope to improve their fuel prices by up to a $1/barrel. That 
would create an annual savings of over $1.5MM per year. This involved a 
lengthy conference call, existing contract review and several forward curves.
6) The weather group was looking for historical propane prices for a new 
product to be offered to Conoco.
7) The San Paulo office called looking for a twenty year forward curve for 
crude and three grades of resid to help them with an LDC project them 
operate. 
8) The Metgas office in India called looking for a one year naphtha hedge 
tied to crude. 
9) ENA called to talk about using jet fuel instead of low sulfur diesel in a 
proposed peaker in Florida. I went through a cost/benefit analysis with them 
and they went back to using the LS diesel curve for the project. 
10) Rob Bradley called looking for help with the Enron Washington, DC office 
who was fighting off a challenge from the NYMEX who wants EOL regulated like 
an exchange. We were able to provide Chris Long numerical data that helped 
Enron's case and ultimately Enron got the initial ruling they were looking 
for. 

All of the above were in addition to our normal daily duties (battles) with 
the five EI power plants and their fuel deliveries, along with the new 
business ventures we are involved in. If you want specific big money savings 
for other Enron entities or projects I would refer you to the previous memos 
I have sent you regarding India, Guatemala and Panama which exceeded $20MM. 
Hopefully, the daily requests that we service for other Enron groups leads to 
better projects with better actual returns and less overall problems. 

If you need additional information I would be glad to provide it.

Jeff,

Let me know what you think of this guy.  Wade Cline and Tim Det. are both 
high on him.  Jeff Donahue is not so sure but will meet with him on Friday.  
During my lunch with Jeff, we discussed that we need a Corp. Dev guy 
dedicated to us full time but if he reported to him, that would be great.  I 
think we could use that co-ordination with his group as long as we didn't get 
a part time guy in the process.  He could also report to us obviously (like 
Larry) but i think in this case a dual role makes a  lot of sense.  What do 
you think?

If you like Don, he could be an immediate candidate to start doing our Corp 
Dev work, but that is of course not the best reason.  I thought he was all 
right and he did have a good understanding of our products and is an 
innovative thinker.  He has also worked as a trader and although it doesn't 
seem possible by his personality, having some background is a plus.  

Mike

Sally,

Thanks for the e-mail regarding summer interns.  I apologize that Lexi and=
=20
Shelly were unable to provide you with the answers you were seeking.  I wis=
h=20
that you had contacted either Celeste or me to indicate that you were havin=
g=20
difficulty.  I have personally assured you on several occasions that I was=
=20
available to either speak with you or meet with you if for some reason any=
=20
member of my staff was not responsive.  That being said please allow me to=
=20
explain the recruiting strategy since I was instrumental in helping to set =
it.

You are absolutely correct.  It is great to do market research if time=20
permits or it is regarding an issue of which we have little knowledge.  As=
=20
you are aware, over the past year we have engaged a professional recruiting=
=20
firm (Brecker & Merryman) who has assisted us in a number of different mark=
et=20
research projects.  However, in my opinion, this issue is not one that=20
required much research.  I have been involved in recruiting in some way,=20
shape or form at both the graduate and undergraduate level for the past 10=
=20
years.  Most major organizations, with the exception of the Accounting firm=
s,=20
begin the summer intern recruiting process in early spring.  There are=20
actually some universities that do not allow recruitment of summer interns=
=20
until after a certain date, particularly in the MBA programs.  For example,=
=20
Harvard does not allow an organization to come on campus and speak to first=
=20
year students until January.  As indicated, the firms that generally recrui=
t=20
in the fall are the Accounting firms and they are primarily recruiting for=
=20
"spring" internships.

The recruiting strategy at Enron is no different this year than it was last=
=20
year with respect to summer interns.   Presentations were made in January &=
=20
February and offers were made in February and March.  The only school that=
=20
did not follow the normal process was OU under the direction of George Hope=
. =20
We did, of course, recruit summer interns in the fall for the tax group=20
because they are competing directly with the Accounting Firms.

Utilizing this strategy did not impair Enron=01,s ability to hire quality s=
ummer=20
interns.  This past summer Enron had 76 summer Analysts (undergraduate) and=
=20
40 summer Associates (graduate).  We intentionally limited the number of=20
summer hires to ensure that the individuals hired received meaningful=20
assignments.  Approximately 85% of these individuals received permanent=20
offers to join Enron.  =20

The reason Enron has not had a problem recruiting quality undergraduate=20
summer interns is primarily because many organizations do not hire=20
undergraduates for summer positions.  They generally focus on MBAs,=20
particularly the investment banks and consulting firms which are the firms=
=20
that Jeff Skilling identifies as Enron's competitors.  Because the=20
undergraduates are not actively recruited by our competition we have=20
continued to have a special focus on these individuals (i.e. the reason the=
re=20
were 76 undergraduates and only 40 MBAs).

With respect to OU and UT specifically since those were the schools about=
=20
which you raised a concern, let me address your concerns.  In your e-mail y=
ou=20
indicated that you had research conducted at UT and OU.  You did not howeve=
r,=20
provide the results of the research or the person to whom they had spoken=
=20
therefore I had Lexi Elliott contact both UT and OU.

While OU has not gotten back to her, following is the information obtained=
=20
from UT.

o The contact at UT Career Services is Cindy Henson. =20
o According to Cindy, approximately 5% of companies actively recruiting on=
=20
campus conduct interviews in the fall for "summer" internships.  Cindy=20
attributes  this to the fact that these companies cannot come in the spring=
,=20
or, in the case of Andersen Consulting, have a tremendous need and conduct=
=20
all interviews  at one time. =20
o In conclusion, Cindy estimated that 95% of companies actively recruiting =
on=20
campus recruit in the spring for summer internships.

We have not received information from OU therefore I am unable to provide t=
he=20
statistics at this time.  I will provide as soon as I am in receipt of such=
=20
information. =20

It appears that the information your source obtained is considerably=20
different than what we were told.  If you would provide the name of the=20
individual to whom they spoke I will follow up to determine the reason for=
=20
the discrepancies.

While I understand your concern with respect to OU, they appear to be=20
different than most of the other schools at which we recruit.  If you belie=
ve=20
that it is critical to recruit summer interns at OU in the fall we are=20
supportive; however, because Lexi has other school interviews that are=20
already scheduled she will not be in a position to facilitate the interview=
=20
process during the trip you have scheduled currently.  As you are aware, in=
=20
most instances, the dates for presentations and interviews are dictated by=
=20
the respective universities and were secured in early August. If you would=
=20
like for her to try and secure an interview schedule for a later date this=
=20
fall she can certainly work with your schedule and her current schedule to=
=20
support your efforts.

I hope this has been helpful.  I can understand and appreciate your=20
frustration if you are not getting answers from the recruiter or her=20
manager.  Again, I offer that I am available and willing to work with you i=
f=20
you are having difficulty with members of the Program staff. =20

Please let me know what you decide about recruiting this fall for summer=20
interns and whether I can be of any additional assistance.

Charlene

Guys,

Attached below is a presentation that I put together for M Frevert for the 
latest analyst presentation.  We kept it to only a few businesses -  they 
didn't end up using any of it.  I do however want to have an EGM presentation 
that everyone can use.  Please prepare a section on each of your businesses 
and return via email or hard copy.  Don't worry about power point, simply the 
dot points that you want on the page.

Thanks,

the attached summarizes my points for the meeting wednesday.

the main message is that we have the hedging under control, we are doing what 
we said regarding hedging, even though the insurance has not come through 
yet, and our plans are intact, though modified.




let me know your thoughts.  i also have a figure to show how our exposure 
compares under insurance and the current hedge, but it's hard to draw.
(per - i just sent you a fax -- look for it at 6-3247 in the morning).


another update -- the head of berkshire re called this morning from london 
and i spent about a half hour talking to him.  he seems more comfortable with 
our motives and our business plan but will need to spend some time with us 
when he returns before he can recommend a deal to warren.  one issue is that 
warren knows more about electricity than he does (he owns midamerican  in 
iowa and is looking to buy more utilities -- maybe we can sell him PGE), so 
he will have to be better prepared.  i think they want to work with us, but 
timing is still an issue.

Thor,

Thanks for the email.  The timing of it is amazing.  We were talking about 
this yesterday late afternoon.  Jeff and I will be in London next week to 
meet everyone and to get a full briefing of activities and everyone's views 
of their markets.  Cathy Phillips, my assistant, booked us to go to Norway to 
meet you and hear about all the activities that are going on there.  I hope 
you are in and can give us a full download on your business and obviously 
weather.  We made arrangements to go on Thursday and stay Thursday night.  We 
made these plans in advance of knowing your availability.  Do you have dinner 
plans on Thursday evening?  We are scheduled to leave on Friday morning to 
return to Houston.

Please send me a return email to confirm availability and Cathy will add to 
our schedules.  I look forward to meeting you and learning about your 
successful business.  Jeff and I will be available for your entire staff, if 
you would like us to talk about what is going on back in Houston.


Thanks,
mike

Joe,

As we review all the options for Enron Japan (people and commodity/business 
plays), we would like to see how you think it should be organized to 
facilitate growth and have the biggest impact.  When you get a chance to 
examine the EGM information and get your thoughts together, lets us know your 
views and your view of the best way forward.  We have everyone thinking about 
it and we are solidifying our own thoughts as well.

It will help with Morten Erik as well.

Thanks,
Mike

I slowly became sicker every day and finally got really scared because I di=

Since August 3rd, my life has changed a lot.  I was told when to eat, what =
to=20
eat, what NOT to eat and how much to eat. Which is pretty tough to do=20
especially at Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, Valentines Day and Easter=
. =20
Mom paid me for my Halloween candy and took it to work, so that was a good=
=20
deal.  I was told that my genes contained a code for killing the insulin=20
making cells in my pancreas and that all that code needed was probably a=20
virus that I had had last spring to turn it on. My insulin making cells are=
=20
gone forever but they tell me that someday they hope there will be a cure.=
=20

Since I was diagnosed, every day I test my blood at least four times for=20
sugar and take insulin shots three times a day. I have given myself nearly=

1,000 shots and have poked my fingertips for blood nearly 1,400 times and i=

of other people that have diabetes that I=01,m sure you know feel the same =

Dons loss was a shock to all of us and his family is in our prayers.  He was 
a very nice man and his sudden death woke us all up about our priorities.

Mike, 
 I wanted to personally thank you for your support to the fund that was 
established for Don's family.  As of today, we raised $4,106.62.  We have now 
closed this account and are in the process of distributing this money to his 
family.  I have personally spoken to his family regarding this fund and they 
were very thankful and speechless at the generosity that the Enron employee's 
have shown by attending his funeral, creating a scrapbook in his memory, and 
contributing to this memorial fund.  
 I assured the family that Don would be sorely missed, and although I did not 
have the opportunity to personally know Don, he must have been a very special 
person to have touched so many lives, both in his personal life and at work.

Guys:

See below resignation letter of Ivan van Niekerk - this is a huge loss for 
our group, as Ivan was uniquely qualified to originate the South African 
opportunities that we are pursuing.  I spoke with him for about an hour today 
asking him to reconsider as I believe that we are capable of addressing all 
of his complaints.  Unfortunately, Ivan indicates that he has already made up 
his mind and that he does not want to go back on his word to his prospective 
employer.  He will give it some thought overnight and I will speak with him 
again tomorrow (Fri).  This is an example of the toll that excessive 
administrative burdens are starting to take on commercial employees - 
particularly acute in remote offices.

Enron is forming a new organization - - the Enron Xcelerator - - to drive the 
formation and development of new businesses at Enron.  Enron's unique ability 
to start and develop new businesses has driven most of our growth over the 
years.  Lou L. Pai, currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Energy Services, will 
lead the Xcelerator.  Over his years at Enron, Lou has been key to the 
creation and rapid growth of our wholesale gas, wholesale power and energy 
service businesses.  The existing business units will continue their 
development of core businesses, while the Xcelerator will be responsible for 
developing new business opportunities that are natural extensions of Enron's 
business model and core skills, but not currently under development elsewhere 
in Enron.

Dave Delainey, currently President and CEO of Enron Americas, will become 
Chairman and CEO of Enron Energy Services.  Dave brings a wealth of 
experience and accomplishment from Enron Wholesale Services' businesses where 
he led the growth of our Canadian business and our North American origination 
activity and, most recently, had a great year in Enron Americas.

Dave is forming an Office of the Chairman in EES.  Joining Dave in the Office 
of the Chairman are Dan Leff, President of EES, Global Energy Services, and 
Marty Sunde, President of EES, Global Marketing and Services.  Dan and Marty 
have been instrumental in the development and execution of the successful EES 
business model.  Also joining the Office of the Chairman of EES is Janet 
Dietrich as Chief Operating Officer.  Janet, currently is Managing Director 
in Enron Americas, where she has been successful in many of Enron Wholesale's 
core businesses, including gas trading, risk management and structural 
origination.  Tom White will continue as Vice Chairman of EES and will focus 
on the development and expansion of EES' customer relationships.  Lou, Tom, 
Dan, Marty and the entire EES organization have developed a great business 
model with great growth prospects.  EES has become an essential part of 
Enron's market valuation and growth story.  This new leadership structure 
will enable EES to continue on its path of sustained growth and increasing 
profitability.

John Lavorato will succeed Dave as President and CEO of Enron Americas.  John 
has been an essential part of Enron's energy trading success over the years 
and is a key part of Enron Wholesale Services' continuing success story.  
Joining John is Louise Kitchen, currently President and CEO of Enron 
NetWorks.  Louise, who accelerated Enron's outstanding growth with the 
deployment of EnronOnline, will take over as Chief Operating Officer of Enron 
Americas.

Philippe Bibi, currently Chief Operating Officer of Enron NetWorks will take 
over as President and CEO of Enron NetWorks.  Under Philippe's leadership, 
Enron has become a technology leader and the leading e-commerce company.  
Joining Philippe as Chief Operating Officer is Greg Piper, currently Managing 
Director of Enron NetWorks.  Greg currently leads Enron NetWork's origination 
activity and was responsible for the creation and deployment of ClickPaper, 
Enron's successful online pulp and paper marketplace.

Please join us in congratulating all of these individuals on their 
achievements and their new responsibilities.

Ken,

Per my voicemail, we are having an all employee meeting on next Monday at the 
Hyatt Regency.  The purpose of this meeting is to pull everyone together for 
an update on EGM and a brief presentation from all the business units within 
EGM.  This includes about 1 hour of business and then drinks and food - we 
expect about 500 people.  

We have made a lot of progress on changing the nature and profitability of 
these businesses and we want to make sure everyone sees just how far we have 
come in a few months.  

I believe they will be motivated to see the growth and profitability.  We had 
a record Q1 with $100 million of gross margin.  That was 50% of what they 
made in all of 2000.  Combined with the fact that in December of 2000 alone 
we made $87 million in gross margin, I believe it will have a big impact.

If you could attend the meeting even for a few minutes it would go a long way 
in helping us drive our other point which is that the EGM businesses are now 
core to Enron and has the attention of both you and Jeff.

Thanks for considering this and let me know if you need any other information 
or assistance.

Mike

I have not followed this closely  but question why we would give a noncompete 
for this much of Asia in exchange for what I gather is an increased 
expectation in the valuation of Newco in the future if we want to sell.  This 
was the one question I have asked about Dragon all along.  It is a big piece 
of the world to do everything as a minority with these two other partners 
going forward (or have them have a right of first refusal over whatever we 
do).  It is difficult to predict the future and this seems restricitive.  
Maybe I don't understand it all.

Subject: FOR IMMEDIATE REVIEW: Agreement Restricting Power Generation 
Competition in Asia Pacific Region

General Counsels -

At the direction of the Enron APACHI Office of the Chairman, I am sending 
this e-mail to you pursuant to the Enron Corp. Policy on Noncompetition.  I 
would appreciate if you would check with your CEO/COO regarding this e-mail 
and respond to me by Friday, September 29 if you have questions or concerns.  
Enron APACHI may need to commit to the following provisions (that bind Enron 
affiliates) by Monday, October 2.

Given the consolidating power generation market in Asia Pacific, Enron Asia 
Pacific/Africa/China (Enron APACHI) is proposing to enter into a transaction 
with Marubeni and Sithe Asia to combine the respective power generation 
portfolios into a single company (Newco).  Newco would be charged with making 
the shareholders' investments as liquid as possible to allow for sale of the 
shareholders' respective stakes in Newco.  

The shareholders believe that Newco must not be seen by the market as a 
"dumping ground" for existing power projects but rather as the vehicle 
through which the investors will continue to pursue power generation 
opportunities in Asia.  As a result, Enron APACHI proposes to include 
competition restrictions in the Marubeni/Enron Shareholder Agreement that 
would bind their respective affiliates.  

The following is a summary of these competition provisions:

Enron affiliates (with the exceptions stated below) could only develop or own 
power projects in the Asia Pacific Region (as defined below) after first 
offering the opportunity to Newco.  If Newco declines the opportunity, Enron 
would be free to own the project itself or offer the project to third parties 
provided that the terms do not materially improve.  Development or ownership 
does not include the provision of construction, O&M, offtaker or risk 
management services.

There are a number of exceptions to this rule:  (a) small projects involving 
20 MW or less; (b) projects in which Enron owns less than a 1/3 interest; (c) 
projects initiated by our SK joint venture; (d) Korean projects using natural 
gas produced by Enron; (e) projects obtained in a corporate acquisition in 
which Asia generation is less than 20% of the value of the acquisition; and 
(f) situations in which any Enron company would be exposed to fiduciary 
liability to another shareholder in complying with the competition 
restriction.

"Affiliates" will be defined to exclude Enron affiliates which are 
publicly-owned (e.g., Azurix).

"Asia Pacific Region" will be defined to include Brunei, China (including 
Hong Kong and Macau), South Korea, North Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Laos, 
Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, East 
Timor, Singapore, Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Islands (including Guam, 
Saipan, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Fiji, but excluding Hawaii).  
It does not include Japan and Australia.

The competition clause would survive until the earlier of (a) Enron selling 
its interest in Newco or (b) December 31, 2003.

Thank you,
Bruce Lundstrom, General Counsel, Enron APACHI

The Global Liquid Fuels group has been over its VAR limit for the past 7 
days.   There have been some questions regarding the accuracy of the 
numbers.  The RAC-Market Risk Group believes that the calculations are 
generally correct according to accepted methodology.  While it is not 
perfect, the primary issues are not with the calculations but with the data 
inputs and the expectations of John Nowlan of interday position changes 
(where actual trades done have been different than his expectations).  There 
has been a proposal to change the calculation of forward-forward volatilities 
offered by the option trader.  After a review of that request, we believe 
that it would be better to adopt the change proposed and implemented on the 
North American Gas desk.   If  the traders agree and formulate a request, we 
will recommend to Rick that he approve it and instruct the operations team to 
implement as policy.
Please let me know it you have any questions.
Ted

Subject: Delivery of Plant Goods to Gaza

Regarding Wail's message on this subject, here's some background info.on the 
status of shipments to the site. These shipments are of 2 categories:  
in-gauge cargo and out-of-gauge cargo, as explained below.

1. It will be recalled that upon the intervention of US Ambassador Indyk, PM 
Barak gave us permission to transport plant goods to Gaza last October, and 4 
trailers made it to the site. But fighting at the Karni crossing which 
involved 10 Israeli tanks and the first reported use by the Palestinians of 
anti-tank weapons put an end to these shipments. 

2. For a second time, Ambassador Indyk obtained approval to transport plant 
cargo to Gaza last week from PM Barak upon the recommendation of Israel's 
Deputy Defense Minister, Ephraim Sneh. This initially applies to in-gauge 
equipment that can be transported on a back- to- back basis; i.e., at the 
border crossing a Palestinian truck replaces the Israeli truck and the 
license plates are also changed, but the cargo stays on the same trailer. 
Then the cargo gets hauled to the project site.

3. On Monday, Dec 25, 00 tralires of in-gauge imports from Ashdod, and from 
IK Metal industry in Israel, will go to the site. (See the message from the 
freight forwarder, below.) The 3-day Muslim holiday of Id al-Fitr will cause 
these transports to be interrupted next week, after which they will resume.
 
4. The out-of-gauge equipment (e.g., gas turbines) cannot be transported in 
this manner due to the lack of the necessary equipment on the Palestinian 
side. Such equipment must go into Gaza in Israeli convoys with Israeli 
heavy-lift equipment and Israeli operators. Before the disturbances that 
started around the end of September, the Israelis and Palestinians worked out 
a deal wherein the Israeli Army escorted the convoys to Netsarim Road (an 
Israeli settlement in Gaza) and the Palestinian forces guarded the convoy 
from that point until it was unloaded at the site. That is how the first 2 
gas turbines were transported to the site. 

In the present circumstances, two hurdles must be overcome; a) Israeli 
transportation subcontractors are apparently unwilling to entrust the safety 
of their equipment and personnel to Palestinian forces, b) the Israeli and 
Palestinian forces have to work out a suitable arrangement for escorting the 
Israeli convoys in Gaza. I had asked Samir Shawa to bring the latter issue to 
the attention of the Palestinian authorities and he did. Last week, however, 
Samir informed me that the Palestinian officer who was working on this matter 
got killed accidentally. Samir was hopeful that the 2 sides will work it out. 
Until this issue is resolved, it will be difficult to bring out -of- gauge 
cargo into Gaza.

5. We will continue to work with the US Embassy, the Palestinian authorities, 
and PEC  to get all plant cargo to the site. We hope that the political and 
security situation will make this feasible. 

I share Wail's concern and we are trying to use the present window of 
opportunity to get plant goods to the site ASAP. We are pressuring AP and its 
freight forwarder to get going.

6. Today, I received an e-mail from First Secretary of the US Embassy, John 
Lister, regarding a follow-up meeting between Indyk and Sneh last Friday.  At 
this meeting, Sneh reconfirmed the support of the GOI for this project. I 
shall forward that e-mail to you.

All,

Attached, for your information, is  a copy of a general presentation that I 
prepared to illustrate and describe EGM's businesses.  This is a presentation 
that will become a "living" document to communicate our businesses and 
growth.  I will be making numerous changes as we move closer to the analyst 
meeting in January but I wanted to give everyone a copy of this version.

Please don't hesitate to call me if you have any questions or comments.

Mike

BHP has advised that they will not pursue the Vulan (Project Fireball) 
opportunity.  They intend to concentrate on completing their merger with 
Billiton, and settling issues in Indonesia and China.

We will continue to look at Vulcan independently - and evaluate the need (if 
any) for a partner down the road.

Note to coal guys - Dave Murray (ex Billiton) will run the thermal group and 
Bob Kirkby (ex BHP) will run the coking coal group for BHP Billiton - both to 
be located in Melbourne.  Mike Oppenheimer will be doing something outside of 
the coal group.

Toysmart Will Not Sell Customer Names... For Now
(Posted 28-Jul-00)

Following an uproar over Toysmart's intention to
break the privacy promise it made to its customers,
the defunct e-tailer has done an about-face,
deciding not to sell its database of customer
information, after all.

Massachusetts assistant attorney general Pamela Kogut
told the E-Commerce Times that a "key component" was
missing from the FTC conditions for sale of the
customer database.  "Consumers should be given notice
that their names and shopping preferences are going
to be sold, and the opportunity to provide opt-in
consent," the attorney said...

Hi Cate -

Mike McConnell has asked me to respond to you on his behalf.  He said that he 
is fine with the bullet points you have listed below, with the exception of 
"Acquisitions".  Mike will not focus on acquisitions in his speech.

Please let me know if you have any questions or if you need any additional 
information.  Thank you.

Mike,
I am delighted to know that you are available to take part in the Atlanta 
E-Business Summit in October. I have tentatively scheduled you for 
mid-morning on October 3rd - let me know if that does not work for you.

With regard to the focus of your presentation, I have written a suggested 
session description below for your review. It reflects a strategic view of 
Enron's move into online B2B markets, which will be very relevant for our 
audience of C-level executives from the Fortune 1000.

The audience at the 21st Century Internet Summit will be primarily CIOs and 
senior executives from Internet companies, so perhaps you could deliver the 
same presentation with a slightly more technological content and perspective.

The programme for the E-Business Summit goes to print next week, so please 
forward me any modifications of the text below by July 19.


Leveraging core brick-and-mortar assets to create new businesses

o     Shifting strategies: turning an energy company into a new economy player
o     Acquisitions: targeting companies on which to build B2B platforms
o     Applying Enron's model to other wholesale commodity markets
o     Added-value as the competitive edge: risk management, financial 
services, liquidity
o     EnronOnline: evolving the customer relationship while increasing sales

Thank you for your interest in this project and I look forward to seeing you 
in Atlanta.
Best,
Cate Ambrose

Cate,

 I could make the Atlanta conference on Oct. 2 - 3.  The presentation would
be similar to the one I am going to do in Sept. would that be a problem?
Actually, I thought the Sept. conference was aimed at this type of crowd as
well.

Subject:  The Economist E-Business Summit



Dear Mike:

On behalf of The Economist Group, I have the pleasure of inviting you to
participate as a key presenter at our second US E-Business Summit in
October 2000.

The Economist's US e-business series was founded in March 2000 with Summits
in New York and Laguna Niguel California, and with the subtext "Strategic
business transformation for chief executives in the digital economy".

I am aware that you attended the event in Laguna Niguel, where John
Chambers, Dan Nordstrom, and Kevin O'Connor were among the speaker faculty.

The fall E-Business Summits are scheduled for October 2nd-3rd at the JW
Marriott in Atlanta, and October 18th-19th at the Ritz-Carlton in Chicago.
I have attached preliminary drafts of the programme for both cities, which
reflect a session dedicated to Enron Net Works.

We are particularly interested in including a presentation on how Enron has
leveraged core competencies to take on a new role in the Internet economy,

John,
FYI, here is the presentation we discussed today.  This is internal only but 
it can act as a guide if you want to know what we are doing or our approach.  
This is a first draft and I'll send you an updated one when it is finished.

Cate,

 I could make the Atlanta conference on Oct. 2 - 3.  The presentation would 
be similar to the one I am going to do in Sept. would that be a problem?  
Actually, I thought the Sept. conference was aimed at this type of crowd as 
well.

Dear Mike:

On behalf of The Economist Group, I have the pleasure of inviting you to 
participate as a key presenter at our second US E-Business Summit in October 
2000.

The Economist's US e-business series was founded in March 2000 with Summits 
in New York and Laguna Niguel California, and with the subtext "Strategic 
business transformation for chief executives in the digital economy".

I am aware that you attended the event in Laguna Niguel, where John Chambers, 
Dan Nordstrom, and Kevin O'Connor were among the speaker faculty.

The fall E-Business Summits are scheduled for October 2nd-3rd at the JW 
Marriott in Atlanta, and October 18th-19th at the Ritz-Carlton in Chicago. I 
have attached preliminary drafts of the programme for both cities, which 
reflect a session dedicated to Enron Net Works.

We are particularly interested in including a presentation on how Enron has 
leveraged core competencies to take on a new role in the Internet economy, 
including the Net Works initiative to create B2B websites for other 
businesses and industries. We would be delighted to have you speak on this 
subject at either the Atlanta or Chicago Summit.

I understand that you have already agreed to participate as a speaker in the 
21st Century Internet Summit that will take place September 20-22 in Laguna 
Niguel CA. That event, which has been organised by my colleague Lisa Weiner, 
is targeted to an audience of CIOs in its focus on technology, whereas the 
E-Business Summit targets CEOs in its emphasis on strategic business 
transformation.

Thank you for your consideration of this invitation and I look forward to 
following up with you following the holiday weekend.

I see that we are scheduled to have lunch today.   I may have to postpone 
again, I'll let you know later this morning.  I am out all weekend and we 
have to have the final comments on the Analyst Presentation in by sunday 
night so I may be working over lunch.  Actually, I think we are in pretty 
good shape so I will probably be doing lunch but just don't be too mad if I 
have to cancel.

Mike,
 It was nice talking to you at the EGM info session on Monday, the 7th at the 
Hyatt.  As we discussed, I am interested in opportunities within your group, 
specifically the LNG arena.  I interviewed and discussed this issue with Greg 
Curran and Doug J Arnell on Tuesday the 8th.  I strongly believe in the 
mutual benefits derived both from my learning and ability to contribute to 
your efforts.  
 I am currently in my second rotation working for Dan Leff and Dick Leibert 
in EES.  I have been at Enron since 1996.  In my former role, I served as the 
controller for GPG Operations Support (CO 423).  There I managed 25 cost 
centers which perform O&M, Procurement, Document Mgmt, and Regulatory 
Services for GPG and other assets across the globe.  My role was the sole 
source for general administration, budgeting, planning, and financial 
reporting.  This included management of $19.5M on a gross basis and 
overseeing the day-to-day operation of the Mustang timesheet system.  I also 
represented my organization as a Subject Matter Expert (SME) for the July 
2000 implementation of SAP within GPG.  
 In my first rotation in Enron Energy Services I performed analysis, 
forecasting, and pricing of power and gas risk management instruments.  
Currently I am working on projects ranging from Customer Satisfaction, system 
development and implementation, budgeting/space management, California Crisis 
Taskforce to new business ventures and cost savings initiatives.  Although an 
American citizen by birth, I have also spent 14 years living in the 
Caribbean.  I am a team player and a very motivated, high energy individual.  
My experience, the responsibilities bestowed, along my willingness to give 
110% will provide a valuable asset to a group.  I would like to generate a 
dialogue with you regarding the issue.  If there are any questions or 
requests of me, please feel free to let me know.  Thank You
 Adrian Woolcock

Hi Eric,

I started last Monday and this is VERY cool. It is also going to be quite a 
challenge, as the deals are much more complex than what I had the chance to 
see in Europe. Seems that I am going to learn a lot!! so far, expectations 
are met.

 I am also writing you because I have been contacted by an associate who is 
very interested in joining the LNG group. He has been working for Enron since 
1996 and has been involved with gas transportation and EES. He heard about 
the Bahama project and thought that he could add tons of value there, as he 
was raised in Jamaica. He also wants to be involved with a group that allows 
him to have international exposure and, ultimately, the possibility of 
working abroad. I am attaching his resume, in case you are looking for people 
for your group.

Have a nice trip back home.
Fernando

Suzanne,

I glanced at the presentation.  It looks good.  
Two comments:
1.  Could we use our older machines for home use?  They are still very good 
they just aren't the newest technology.  All are fast, CD ready  with plenty 
of memory.  It could knock the cost down significantly.
2.  I would have the cost of Houston only to start with as a pilot.  That 
would reduce our initial costs significantly even for NA.  I recommend that 
you at least know what that cost is as a fall back position.

Good luck.  Your teams hard work really shows here.

Some two weeks ago we sent you the colour illustrations of the works by

Mike/Jeff,

These types of opportunities will continue to come up.  We could certainly 
handle the 13MW and it would be interesting to pursue.  We have also seen 
another opportunity to merchant finance a power plant for another new 
entrant.  As you can imagine, if we passed these to EPower they are not 
likely to get done.

any thoughts?

= Confidential =

Joe,

This is an updated information about ALSTOM's latest activity.

Referring to Enron Japan-ALSTOM Japan Coorporation Meeting for Vendor Finance 
at Enron Japan, ALSTOM found an opportunity.

Customer:

Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. (Hyogo Pref. 60 Hz)
Facility:
- Heavy C firing steam generator without electrcity generation
- Electricity consumtpion 2 MW.
- In terms of permits and land, although further investigation is required, 
in general, it seems acceptable so far.

ALSTOM's proposal to Goodyear Tire & Rubber
- Heavy Oil Firing 15 MW Gas Turbine Co-generation system
(Goodyear tire & Rubber has no money to invest).
- 2 MW for factory and 13 MW for market
- 15-18 months for delivery (estimated)
- Plant cost: 13-15 M$ (estimated)

Next Action required
- EJ to let ALSTOM know deal structure

Issues:
(1) If Enron Japan wants to pursue this opportunity, EJ to respond to them in 
a timely manner, since ALSTOM made an effort to find the opportunity that the 
GT may be able to dispatch electricity next year as per EJ's request.
(2) As per Enron Japan's restructuring, if Enron Japan does not want to 
pursue the opportunity, there may be two options:
- To explain the situstion to ALSTOM and to be prepared for positive 
relationship discontinued (potentially possible)
- To transfer this project E-power by saying, for example, physical asset 
related projects are now handled by E-power.

Please advise me of your comments on the above.

Thanks and regards,

I'm pulling together some sample presentations that should help.  In 
addition, I ususally get fairly involved the first time someone presents so 
just let me know if I can help.  I had assumed that Shankman would attend and 
you are welcome to bring additional people to the Board meeting if you think 
they can contribute to the presentation in some way.  I just ask that you not

It has been a long time since i have presented anything to board especially

g) ENA reaching its 25% ROCE target.

These are truly outstanding accomplishments and our expectations for growth=
=20
and opportunity in Enron North America for 2001 are consistent with that=20
success.  In order to reach these goals, we felt it necessary to re-align a=
=20
number of our organizations. A number of these changes are completed.  The=
=20
goals of such re-alignment include:
a) increase overall productivity with the goal to ensure that every employe=
e=20
is in a position to contribute regardless of skill set;
b) increase overall market coverage, deal flow and information generation=
=20
with the goal to increase bid/offer income, increase the velocity of deal=
=20
flow, improve customer coverage and promote quality information transfer to=
=20
our trading organization;
c) increase deal quality and earnings quality with the goal to (i) allocate=
=20
our resources towards the best transactions and (ii) significantly increase=
=20
our =01&mid-market=018 originated transactions in our portfolio;
d) promote real time decision making and a closer tie between our trading a=
nd=20
origination (mid-market and structured) organizations in order to better=20
align those functions to reduce the amount of un-productive internal focus;
e) increase the overall velocity of the capital being utilized consistent=
=20
with our goal of a 25% plus return on capital employed; and
f) identify and recognize a host of new leaders in the organization that ar=
e=20
critical to meeting our goals next year.

With these objectives in mind, patterned after the successful business mode=

Jeff-

Can you believe it! What's there not to love. It is the  finest
mural/painting of its kind I have seen available since the great TH Benton
mural cycle purchased by Equitable. Historically and qualitatively,
Lewandowski is at the top of the second tier of industrial/precisionist/
social realist painters after artists like Benton and Charles Sheeler. This
is a "machine age" masterpiece that epitomizes the glorification of the
worker and industry- a message Enron should appreciate.

The Lewandowski is a 103" x 67 oil on canvas executed in 1942. It came off
the wall of a building in Milwaukee where Lewandowski lived and worked
during the 1930s-40s.
The condition is quite good with almost no inpainting and a few horizontal
crinkles in the canvas.

The Greenville County Museum of Art had the Lewandowski on final
approval,but they hesitated today and I just committed to buy it as it sat
at the museum.

The price is $275,000.00 which is higher than any of Lewandowski's other
works, but this is monumental and unlike any other work. I hope youw ill
agree taht the price is reasonable for a painting of such scale, quality,
and historical significance.

Lewandowski's good early industrial watercolors of this era, 18" x 24" +/-,
have sold for $50,000.00+++. The "Circuit Breakers" painting I own that you
have seen at the gallery is priced at $150,000.00 and it is close to being
sold. I think Southwestern Bell has a Lewandowski watercolor and I know I
recently saw an 1939 industrial  Lewandowski painting hanging at the Dallas
Museum of Art.

The Lewandowski will be shipped to me from the Greenville County Museum in
the coming weeks and I hope you and others at Enron can arrange to see it.

John,

Thanks for the email.  It was great hearing from you.  This job will be fun 
and it will be odd to return to the energy business after my last year in 
technology and the new economy.  I am glad to hear that all is well with you 
and your family.  I don't have a trip planned currently but I am sure I'll be 
in London at some point during the year.  I'll give you a call.

Cheers,
mike

Jay,  

I think that should be looked at and re-evaluated. The way I had it, AS, PB, 
DB and I (we had commercial and IT infrastructure covered in  1 call) all 
attended the video calls but I primarily drove the business activities and 
co-ordination.  I had envisioned Allan and your group taking over directly 
pre my change and pre other international ongoing activities.  I suggest that 
all of you re-look at it and do what you want but there are obvious big 
changes coming that will affect your decision and how we will approach the 
business opportunities.  I believe they are a great resource for future 
development and they really appreciated the communication effort and we 
really helped them.

Good luck,
Mike

FYI, here is the latest draft of their business plan for your review and
commentary.  I had the video call yesterday and went through all the org

reasons.

Subject:  Re: Draft Business Plan Enron Net Works South America  (Document
      link: Mike McConnell)


I think there are 2 principal drivers:

(1)  the respective Business Unit heads inside of Networks (Houston or
elsewhere ) need to know who Steve and I are, that we're involved and that
we have a      mandate ( actually this probably warrants some clarification
vis-a-vis the Argentine office, as well; especially given the hiring of
Bastos - I for one would like      to get a clear and substantive
understanding in regard to his trading background, priority for physical
vs. financial products, and expectations ) and
(2)  we (Enron SA) need an invitation, but also need to probably be more
aggressive about participating in meetings, discussions - both strategic
and       functional for each of  the Business Units

Once we reach a consensus on an Enron SA Bus Plan with focus, targets will
establish some parameters to participate inside the group going forward.

Mike, your efforts to communicate both updating events vis-a-vis the weekly
call and overtures outside the group have been a great initiative and much
appreciated.  It's made an important, productive impression on Enron
employees "outside"of Networks.  Look forward to further discussions all
around.

Mike,

Per your request, attached is the draft Business Plan for South America.
Due to agenda constraints, Joe Kishkill has not yet had the opportunity to
review.

As part of structuring the regional effort, it would be important to
streamline and coordinate the due diligence and market study efforts. There
appears to be some confusion between Houston and S?o Paulo over who is
responsible for what. We may need to formally announce D'Arcy's and my
roles, including the need to channel information through us into and out of
the region.

Please let us know your thoughts.

Thanks, Steve

Doug,

Last week, you referenced that there are a lot of deals that come up during 
the day for various regions and companies around Enron that your group 
doesn't get any monetary recognition for but that they need to be done or are 
provided as a service to save money. By the way, saving money is real money 
to Enron.   Would you please provide me with some examples of that so I can 
put it in context?

Thanks,
Mike

Mike,

We have an opportunity that may interest your management team.  We publish
LNG Express and the related website www.LNGExpress.com.  LNG is a unique
form of natural gas trade, representing some $20 billion per year and
growing at 7-8%/year.  The industry is a fairly insular community.  Our
publication, website, industry reports, databanks, annual conferences and
consulting services have grown to be possibly the most visible.

LNG has a growing spot and short-term contract market. There is currently no
exchange for global trades.  Nor is there an exchange for carrier vessel
capacity, excess plant capacity, e-procurement or remote gas leases.
LNGExpress.com could be platform for such an exchange with content and
readers already established.  We might also assist Enron sign up exclusive
agreements with LNG suppliers and/or buyers.

Please let me know your thoughts ASAP.  I suspect this window of opportunity
will close quickly.

Best regards,

Here is a synopsis of what Mike and I talked about;
I will come up with 3 schemes and create 1/16th site/floor plans and a 3
dimensional rendering showing the form and massing. This conceptual phase
will take approximately 1 month and cost up to $1500 per scheme. After you
review them and have picked and chosen what you like from each, I will
develop ?" floor plans, sections and fa?ade elevations. This schematic
design phase will take approx. 6 weeks. I'll charge you $150 per hour and
depending on the scheme it will run from$3000 to $4500. After that point a
local architect can do the design development phase (which is a more
detailed look at the exterior and interior of the house and will probably
take 6-10 weeks) and the construction document phase (which will probably
take 3 months). I have several architects in mind and can contact them if
you'd like. The architect should also do construction supervision. I'm not
sure what architects charge there but it should run from 3 to 6 percent of
construction cost.
During this time I can look at any special rooms or cabinetry in more detail
and I'll charge you an hourly rate.
On large projects architects often work in this way, one designing and one
doing the working drawings. I recently worked on a house here for Craig and
Walter where I designed it and the working dwgs. were done in Chicago. I
hope this explains things.
PS Sorry this took so long but I started designing and already have one
scheme figured out.
Talk to you soon,
Steve

Dear Mike:

On Friday, February 23, 2001 we received by fax a copy of the Residential
Construction Contract Mr. Kent intends on using in connection with the
construction of your home.  Upon receipt we noticed that it was not a Cost
Plus Contract.  Therefore, we spoke with him about this matter.  He
indicated that although he believes he will be doing the home on a cost plus
basis, no final agreement regarding this matter had yet been made.

The Residential Construction Contract form he uses is a Greater Houston
Builders Association form which is, for the most part, a good one although
it is written primarily to protect the builder.  Therefore, we may ask that
a number of minor changes be made to the Contract as it relates to notice
requirements to you regarding problems in construction and some changes in
the indemnity language.  In addition, there may be some other changes we
request.  Under any circumstance, we can dictate a letter to Mr. Kent at the
appropriate time.

Mr. Kent also indicated that he will make sure we receive a copy of the Deed
Restrictions as soon as possible.

We assume that you will acquire financing for the construction of the home
itself.  When you close, Flair Construction Co., Inc. will also have to
provide to you a Disclosure Statement which spells out some of your rights
and responsibilities under Texas law and a Contractors List of
Subcontractors and Suppliers which tells you the names and addresses of the
Subcontractors Flair intends on using.  We are sure that the construction
lender will require that these documents be provided at the appropriate
time.

Should you have any questions or comments, please call us.

Jonny,

Thank you so much for the email and kind words.  I was very moved by it and 
you know I feel the same way.  I have become very reflective with the more 
"success" that I have been fortunate enough to receive.  I am so thankful and 
appreciative and although I have always been religious and spiritual, it has 
grown more deeply.  I see so many people that have lost their perspective and 
I pray that I will remain grounded and truly appreciate the blessings that 
our family has received.  Chris and I often discuss how we can help others 
and what can we do to really make a difference.  

The Jones and the McConnells are truly very lucky.   Thanks, and give my love 
to your family.

Mike


PS:  What about OU - Texas, do you have any ideas or plans already in the 
works?

Sometimes we fail to stop and reflect on events which are of significance
because we are so busy with our heads down accomplishing the things we
strive for.  I hope you are taking a moment to reflect and enjoy the
incredible accomplishments which you have achieved at such a young age.  You
and I are two of the luckiest people in the world and must always remember
to give back what we have been so fortunate to receive.

Congratulations and keep up the good work.  I am proud to call you my

On Tuesday, July 25, I am meeting with Molecular Electronics Corp. (MEC) to 
discuss the opportunity for establishing this newly formed company in 
Houston.  For those of you that are not familiar with MEC, they are 
considered one of the premier companies in the area of molecular computing.  
MEC has approached Enron to discuss a possible alliance that would facilitate 
their development and, in particular, location in the Houston area.  MEC 
represents the frontier of computing technology.

I would like to invite you to participate in a working lunch discussion of 
the opportunities and obstacles facing a company that is seeking to change an 
industry.  I would appreciate it if you could join us on July 25  from 11:30 
to 1:30 in EB49C1 for this informal roundtable with the CEO of MEC, Harvey 
Plotnick and one of the founders, Jim Tour.

Will you please let Vanessa Groscrand know if you can attend at 713-853-1769 
or please reply by e-mail to me.

Mike,
I am totally booked today and am physically out of our office most of the 
day.  Cathy has attempted to coordinate and has set him up to talk with a 
couple of other senior people in New Works and technology.  She will know if 
my schedules changes and I become available.

Sorry it couldn't work out.

There is a gentleman in Houston today and tomorrow that I would like you to 
talk to. He has responsibility for one of the online trading systems in 
Argentina that we are looking at and we are in the process of hiring him. He 
is the architect of Argentina's energy sector and the past Sec of Energy. I 
think you will find him quite interesting. His name is Carlos Bastos. The

Would you be available tomorrow some time? You could also be a representative

Interesting.  Do you like this guy?  What about Crude and products 
origination working for Randy?  On the LNG front we should look at him if you 
like him but i don't think it is a no brainer.  Neal will be coming on in 2

Mike,

Enjoyed seeing you at the Masters and hope we can do it again in 2002.

I've taken the liberty to attach below the name of an individual who has a
distinguished business career and since leaving Pittston as an executive VP
in 1998, has started his on fund as well as developing other business
ventures.  He is very well connected and highly regarded in the Wall Street
financial community.

I don't know where it may lead but I am of the opinion it would be of
benefit for you both to at least have a discussion and explore
opportunities.

I look forward to your next visit to BMR and also hearing the outcome of
your discussion with Gary.

Tabatha, please schedule this meeting for August 10th.  Greg, Gary and I
should be able to handle it.  Russell, David, Tom - let Tab know if you want
to attend.  Tab, also invite Kevin Lyng, or whoever he designates, so we
have someone who can carry the ball on contacting zees who aren't taxing
correctly.

Also, does anyone have the document showing the taxes and results by store?
I only have the "here's what we did, here's what we found" letter.

To fix all this, we need to know the correct tax rate per store, the method
they should be using, and whether parts and/or labor need to be reported on
the invoice.  Then, our little group can make some consistency decisions
about how taxes will be computed and reported at the company stores (there
are some options we need to nail down), then IT will implement.

Gary,

Thanks for the email.  Here is my attempt to type out a response.  I hope it 
helps.

1.  It was a matrix organization.  The IT personnel reported into the Global 
Tech. group but we did that for communication and consistency  purposes 
rather than simply control.  They attended business unit staff meetings and 
the BU had a great influence in the review process and gave constant 
feedback.  It was vitally important for the "customer" to be happy and that 
the IT person completed the projects from the BU.  When it came to the review 
process itself, GT ranked all the employees and peers but the business unit 
had the greatest influence on where the person actually ranked and was rated.

2.  When Enron Net Works was formed, nothing really changed on the day to day 
working of the IT world.  IT (Global Technology) was folded into the newly 
created 5th business unit at Enron.  Remember Global Technology had more that 
IT alone.  We had an eCommerce commercial group, a principal investments 
group and was developing eCommerce or Technology origination roles developing 
around the world.

Philippe Bibi is the CTO for Enron and Enron Net Works.  He is in the office 
of the chairman of ENW with Greg Whalley, CEO and Louise Kitchen, the newly 
appointed COO.  Both LK and GW are non IT people.  There are many VPs on the 
next level that are IT executives.

3.  In a nut shell, Scott grinned when I told him of my 2 weeks experience 
and title as CEO with Enron's goal of becoming the largest B2B player in the 
world.  He chuckled and said something like, "That sounds like Enron, it 
always looks at things differently.  He then stated that my CEO title and 
Enron's approach was very unusual but that it would be more common place 
soon,  as this was the way of the future and Enron was the first to recognize 
it and change its culture".

4.  When i used the word cannibalize, I meant that if we didn't change the 
business ourselves, than our competition would do this for us.  For example, 
we were the leading trader of natural gas in the US by far but we initiated 
EnronOnline and completely changed the way we traded natural gas and did it 
for free.  Thus we cannibalized our own successful business even when it was 
going great.  We are looking at all of our businesses for changes like that.

Gary, I hoped that helped.  Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have 
any other questions.

Mike

Subject: Thanks and a few residual questions




Hello Mike,

Thanks for sending me those presentation slides. They are good background. And
thanks so much for meeting with Julia and me this week. It was most 
interesting
and helpful. I'm confused on a couple of points, so would you mind answering a
few more questions?

1. You said that after Enron created the Global Technology group, you "seeded
people out into the business units, and the way we did that is we had those
people be totally accountable both to us and to the business unit head." So, 
at
that point it was a sort of matrix organization, with IT people dispersed
thoughout the business units but at the same time accountable to a central IT
organization for things such as standards, is that correct?

2. Then, this spring when Net Works was formed, did those 1,500 IT people
essentially leave the business units to join a more traditional IT 
organization?
Roughly how many non-IT people, and of what types, are part of Net Works? Two 
of
the three top managers in Net Works are non-IT (from trading), correct? Does 
any
given IT person now still live in a matrix world with responsibilities to IT 
and
to a business unit?

3. For some reason, my recorder messed up and I couldn't decipher what you 
said
about Scott McNealy's reaction to your background, etc. at the breakfast. 
Could
you repeat that?

4. You said: "We had to cannibalize our own businesses. So what I think you'll
see five years from now is that the IT world will look totally different." 
What
did you mean by "cannibalize our own business"?.

Thanks again.

Regards,
Gary Anthes

Subject: Resumes from George Damiris and Randy Balhorn

 Mike:

 I finally got George Damiris' resume (attached) as well as that of Randy 
Balhorn (also attached). I think when you read Randy's CV, you will be very 
impressed. I would go so far as to say that he was the smartest person I knew 
at Koch, and when you see the list of accomplishments that he had there, as 
well as what he was doing with Dreyfuss and Electricite de France, you will 
agree with me that he would be a terrific addition to Enron Global Markets. 
The even better news regarding Randy is that he recently left Dreyfuss due to 
issues with the EDF JV, so he is available immediately and he is very 
interested. He currently lives in London and I think that he knows Joe Gold. 
Please let me know if you would like me to do anything to help facilitate 
this further.  I think George is interested if there was a specific 
opportunity for him here that he felt was an even better fit than what he is 
doing with Koch. The fact that he is moving to Houston makes it pretty easy 
for us to keep having discussions with him. I would say, however, if I had to 
choose which among the two of them would have the most immediate impact if 
hired by Enron, it would have to be Randy, given his experience.

Thanks,

Basil

Joe,
Sorry for the big delay in all my responses.  I'm out on vacation Wed - Wed. 
and can't make the video call. Please don't hesitate to set up with 
Shankman.  In general he is very on board with a big effort in Asia and 
realizes my views on Asia and that we have issues in Singapore.  Japan will 
be a  real focus for Enron Global Markets.  He could use an update.

Mike,

Would it be possible to get yourself and Shankman on a video call sometime 
this week?  While we have given you an update a little over a month ago, 
quite a bit has happened since then.  This might also be a good intro for 
Shankman, particularly before we can you the both of you over this way.

Wed your time would be preferable... but we are flexible.

Joe

Thanks for the email.  Also, nice job on the phone today with Whalley.  I 
think you answered all of his questions and concerns and I think you'll like 
meeting him next week.

Dear Mike:

I spoke to Alan Kent from the Title Company this morning,  He was there
signing the Contract and I assume depositing the $20,000 balance of earnest
money.  I reminded him that we were looking to him to acquire and pay for
the Survey.  He indicated that would not be a problem.

As soon as the Commitment for Title Insurance is issued and the Survey
completed a closing date will be set.

If you have any questions, please call or E-mail me back.

life and our businesses.  Attached are the two presentations we discussed.  A

Please forward to me a contact and telephone number of the person I should

Guys, we are bringing through a VP candidate for your review.

Her name is Faye Worthy.  She has a great sales history in the energy 
industry and I think can really help us in the franchise market (ie) 
McDonalds, Safeway, Starbucks, Motel 6, etc.

I would really appreciate you spending a little time with her.   I will 
forward her resume.

Thanks
Dave

Mike,

Attached is the "Net Works" section we discussed.  In addition, could you ask 
the Online team for the missing information in this Jeff Skilling earnings 
release quote.  We need to distribute the earnings release draft early this 
afternoon.

 "In the second quarter, EnronOnline registered a ______% increase in volumes 
and a _____% increase in transactions versus the first quarter."

Thanks,

All,

I came back from the big dance last night.  It was a real privilege to be 
there.  I've been to 15 OU/TX games and the energy, excitement and overall 
electricity in the orange bowl beat them all put together.  It was wild and a 
moment that I will never forget.  
Bob Stoops for president!  He is the king.  

The best was at the end of the game (and everyone stayed around celebrating 
until about 1:30 am) when they said, "there was the Wilkenson era, there was 
the Switzer era and welcome to the Stoops era.  Oklahoma is back".

Boomer Sooner,

Mike

Market size is in the presentation, thanks.  I want you to pick the number 
you want me to reference as our potential market share target and a potential 
margin number extrapolated from that.

Please respond ASAP with what you feel comfortable with.

Thanks,
mike

Tom,

In response to our discussion, attached is Fritz's resume.  It doesn't prin=
t=20
well.  As i mentioned earlier, I have know him for many years and was his=
=20
employee and then his business partner.  I exited the business when we were=
=20
ready to go public (which never happened as planned).  His company went und=
er=20
a couple years after that. =20

Fritz is an amazing self made man.  He is the consummate salesman and would=
=20
be (and he now has some background) a great trainer.  He works tirelessly a=
nd=20
has a great deal of energy and sales experience.  At one point he was=20
considered to be one of the top natural gas transport experts in the US and=
=20
that is where he made his millions at Excel.  He lost all of it in the end.

He needs help and has come to me for consulting work or a job.  Robert Jone=
s,=20
VP for HR for Wholesale - Networks, worked with him and he did some work fo=
r=20
us and was pleased with the training work.  He is also considering other=20
options.

I thought he might fit somewhere in your organization because of his sales,=
=20
marketing and ability to work with a wide variety of  customers.  EES has s=
o=20
many different types of jobs and skill sets.

I would be very grateful if you or Beth would interview him and see if ther=
e=20
is a fit somewhere in the organization.  I would really appreciate it if on=
e=20
of you would take 30 minutes and see if there is a fit anywhere.

Thank you very much.  I consider this a favor and one that might just work=
=20
out.

Sincerely,
Mike

Thanks for sending this Mike!  No wonder you are so busy....

I will have a first draft for you next week.

Kathie,

Thank you for your email.  I've been out and all over the world.  I 
appreciate your help on this article.  Attached is a copy of a presentation 
that will fill you in on some of the businesses that we are working on.  This 
should give you some ideas and clarifications on the first draft.

Here are a few other points of emphasis.

EGM was created to provide sharpened focus on very large global markets and 
commodities to enable them to grow quickly 
These markets are huge and we will become a big player rather than being 
active in them
EGM provideds true network for market making opportunities related to 
commodities that are highly liquid in physical and financial terms and are 
enormous in market size
EGM leverages the value of Enron's existing network and international asset 
positions
EGM's operation will coordinate with leveraging all of our wholesale 
businesses
EGM has very aggressive growth targets in transactions and earnings
EGM has contributed almost $200 million in gross margin in its first  2 
quarters in existence
Go big or go home philosophy
EGM will represent a clear transfer of  Enron wholesale market making model 
into other commodities this year
GROWTH is the key!!!


Thanks for your help.

Mike

Good Morning Mike!

The next issue of our newsletter is in the works, with a planned distribution 
set for late June. Mark Frevert has requested that the Executive Letter be 
rotated among the presidents of EWS. This is the inside cover message and 
should be 300+ words. I hope that you will be able to squeeze this into your 
busy schedule.

Here is a suggested outline.  If you want to fill in the outline with 
information, I will be happy to turn it into a letter for you.

 I.  An overview of EWS/EGM as we move forward.

 II. A short-term retrospective about EGM activities and successes

           III. Future plans/initiatives for EGM
     (strategic vision of the group, opportunities, expectations, etc.) 

Please feel free to modify as you see fit.  I have attached Greg Whalley's 
letter from our last issue to give you an idea of the format. Let me know if 
there is anything I can do to help you.  I need your letter by June 15, if 
possible.

 << File: Ensisde Whalley Letter. April 01.doc >>

Our relocation to the new building is fast approaching and there are several 
important move related items that I would like to stress at this time.  I 
would appreciate your cooperation with the key move issues that are outlined 
below:

IMPORTANT - A special building tour has been scheduled for the EGM business 
unit heads receiving this message.  Jeff and I, along with Bill Donovan, 
would like to invite you to join us for a tour on this Friday morning, June 
8th, from 8:30 to 9:30 a.m.  Even if you have already had an opportunity to 
visit the new building, we think this would be a great opportunity for all of 
us to see the space together and discuss any issues at that time.  Please 
contact Cathy Phillips at X-36898 if you plan to attend the tour.
New building floor plan modification requests will no longer be accepted.  
Any change requests that have already been received are currently being 
considered and will be conveyed to the appropriate business unit head.
If vacant positions exist and they will be filled before the move on August 
3rd, they need to be identified on all reports and floor plans with their 
name, NH (for new hire) and an approximate hire date.  Example:  Bob Smith NH 
7/25
Any space/move related questions or issues that may arise should be addressed 
by Cathy Phillips.  Please do not contact Susan Lopez for any space related 
issues.  Jeff and I have asked Cathy and Jennifer Burns to be responsible for 
the allocation of space in the new building and they are keeping us well 
informed as to the progress and any issues as they arise.
Jeff and I are very aware that space is very tight in the new building and we 
will be addressing growth and additional space needs and issues in the near 
future.
A limited number of Turret phones will be available in the new building.  The 
Turret phones will be assigned to traders and their assistants only.  
Everyone else on the floor will receive a new upgraded version of the Lucent 
phone (with the existing phone numbers).  Please contact Jennifer Burns if 
you have any questions or issues related to phones.
All private team rooms, offices and conference rooms have been assigned and 
there are no more available for assignment to the individual groups or 
people.  On the 3rd floor we will have the following public conference space 
available by making reservations (specific scheduling details to follow 
later):
1 Mega conference room
1 Large conference room with videoconference capabilities
1 Large conference room - no videoconference 
3 Team rooms
File space on the floor is being upgraded and allocations of file space will 
be made for each group.  Every attempt is being made to have the assigned 
file space as close to each individual group as possible.
At this time, details related to food deliveries and distribution have not 
been resolved.  Your patience and flexibility with all food related issues 
will be appreciated.  It is highly probable that food service in the new 
building will be very difficult at first and as we get closer to the move 
date, more information will be provided related to food service, deliveries 
and distribution.
Since Jeff and I both already keep Cathy and Jennifer very busy, we would 
appreciate it if you would send all your comments, questions, or issues to 
them via e-mail.  They have agreed to make themselves available every Monday 
at 4:30 p.m. to meet with anyone to discuss their questions.  Please make 
arrangements with them directly to meet regarding your issues.
There will be a 60 day freeze on any building changes once we move into the 
new building.

I understand that this is a difficult process and that there are a lot of 
questions and issues, but Jeff and I are convinced that this will be great 
and everything will work out in time.  Thank you for your cooperation and 
assistance in making this transition to the new building as smooth as 
possible.

Mike

Thanks for the input. We'll add.  Point of clarity: the employees who have 
company-paid computers at home today typically have surplus older equipment 
(except for executives) and have management approval to use for business 
use.  The ENhome program is a different offering which does not require 
business purpose and the equipment will be new.

Thanks again for the input.

Subject: Re: EnHome - Please review  

Suzanne-- the presentation looks good-- I would add at the beginning two 
other reasons to provide all employees with  Enhome :

1. A matter of equity-- we already have 2000 employees with computers at 
home--- and it could be argued that if 2000 employees deserve computers at 
home, the bulk if not all o/f the workforce also deserves  having that kind 
of support. 

2. Work at the office and at home is becoming increasingly indistinguishable; 
while as a company we don't state that we expect employees to work at home, 
the reality is that  few of us can get our work done unless we work at home-- 
and to be effective , we have to be connected. That simple.

Chris

Mike,

Attached is the draft for the upcoming orientation.  I tried to update the 
Forrester graph with projections through 2004; however, I don't have a B2C 
projection for 2004.  I have made some alternate slides that have some other 
research firms' projections.  I will bring them up for you to look at when 
convenient.  I will keep working on it.  

Thanks.

Mike and Eric,

Informally I was told today that the new President of PDVSA Gas will be 
Nelson Nava, this is very good news for us since he has been a very strong 
supporter of the project for a long time. We have a solid relationship with 
Nelson, so I believe he could be a good sponsor for our project. More 
importantly, we will not have to educate Nelson about the project. Just in 
case you don't remember, we all met him when we visisted PDVSA-Gas earlier 
this years. The meeting in PDVSA-Gas was in his office.

Once it is official, it would be a very good idea for you Mike to call him to 
congratulate him. I will let you two know next week.

Emilio

Stuart,

Thanks for the email and raising this issue.  While reading it, I must admit 
I was very surprised.  I am not a big baseball fan and have been to only 2 
games this year and I hadn't noticed it.  I just called Cindy Olson and left 
her a voicemail with your concern.  I will not forward your email and I will 
respect your privacy request.  When I hear from her, I'll let you what she 
says.

Thanks,

Subject: Enron Field

Mr. McConnell,

I went to Enron Field this past Fri.  and saw something disturbing.  Just 
after the Astros pitcher stuck out a batter, a cartoon came on the screen.  
The cartoon showed 3 K's dropping on a batter, turning him into a small black 
puddle. The 1st thing that ran through my mind was the Klue Klux Klan, and 
some extremely unpleasant memories I've had with them. If I'm alone in my 
thinking there should be no problem, however if other people have similar 
thoughts, this could raise some bad publicity. 

I did not feel gong through the proper chain of authority would be correct in 
this situation. (The less people that know, the better)   I do not know who 
the proper contact is to voice this concern, but felt you would be in a 
better position than me to decide if this is an actual problem, and how to 
resolve it if it is a problem.

Stuart

Allison,

Thank you very much for the email and request.  As much as i an very proud of 
our accomplishments while being responsible for Global Technology, I am still 
of the opinion that Philippe Bibi is the best and most qualified candidate 
from Enron.   Enron has changed its culture and business around technology 
and EnronOnline alone changed the way our business operates.  EOL ended the 
year over with over $330 billion in transactions.  EOL was only 1 part of our 
transformation however.  

Thanks again and good luck with your award.

Sincerely,
Mike McConnell

Mike,

My apologies for bothering you on your holiday.  Dr. Irani has had the
opportunity to visit with HRH, the Foreign Minister on a couple of occasions
in the past week.  We have been given a few insights that I would like to
share with you.  The most significant is the suggestion that we request
permission from the Negotiating Team to begin discussions with the other
short-listed companies about possible consortium arrangements.  We want to
make sure that Enron is comfortable with that at this stage.  Our intent
would be to have very high-level contacts to guage interest but not to make
any commitments at this point.

Thanks and I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards and I hope you had a great holiday,

Casey Olson

Attached is a draft of the All Employee Meeting presentation.  I know the 
cover and some other slides are NOT aesthetically pleasing, so I asked

Mike and Jeff,

This note is to update you on information we have related to the GTL Methanol 
project in Darwin, Australia.

Larry, John and I met with Chase/JP Morgan, specifically, the banker who led 
the financing of the Titan Methanol Plant in Trinidad. We wanted to get an 
independent opinion on the financeability of the current GTL structure and 
insights into the current market for project bank debt for commodity deals.

The key opinion of Steve Nordaker, the Chase banker on the Titan deal, was 
that project banks do not take commodity price risk unless they have a very 
clear, supportable view of the long-term market price for that commodity. As 
for methanol, with the high level of uncertainty about the demand and price 
for methanol as tied to the future of MTBE, Steve said that Chase would need 
a profit margin contractually guaranteed by the project documents before 
lending to a project. Steve further suggested that if the gas supply contract 
had a floating price tied to methanol prices with a floor price, that floor 
should be around $0.50/ mmbtu to give the lenders comfort that the plant 
would remain competitive over the years required to repay the debt. GTL has 
agreed to a fixed price of $1.02/mmbtu with Phillips. Chase would not lend to 
the Darwin Methanol project as structured with a fixed price for the gas 
input and an index price for the methanol off take. Nordaker thought that it 
would be very hard to find even one bank to take the unhedged risk on the 
methanol margin. In fact, GTL will need at least ten banks to raise the full 
$250 million of senior project debt.

Another key risk that Chase would not take is the strength of the Sponsor, in 
this case GTL. GTL has a total market cap of approx. $30 million. It will 
have to issue new shares equal in value to more than its current market cap 
to fund its portion of the project equity. If the project experiences cost 
overruns, the Lenders will expect someone with a high credit rating or 
demonstrable financial strength to invest whatever amount is needed to finish 
construction. 

I think that GTL is taking a big risk of wasting several months before 
finding out that its project is not financeable. In addition to the waste of 
time, GTL will have signed a gas supply agreement that will have to be 
renegotiated, and other key documents may need to be amended. EGM will not 
get the methanol it wants on time and may be faced with the choice of 1) 
taking on extra methanol price risk (by agreeing to buy more of the plant's 
output at a fixed price or by providing sponsor support) or 2) dropping out 
of the deal. If we have hedged some risk in anticipation of the project 
succeeding, then we will face pressure to take on more risk to cover the 
hedges.

I think that GTL's deal is fixable, and John wants the methanol. I, 
therefore, recommend that we push GTL on several key structural elements so 
that GTL achieves a feasible project and so that EGM receives its methanol on 
time. Because EGM is only willing to buy 1/3 of the plant's production of 
methanol at a fixed price, the most important point is to get Phillips to 
agree to a floating gas price. Kevin Alexander of GTL says that they have 
tried, but that Phillips would not accept it. If necessary, we should offer 
to intervene with Phillips. We will, also, try to keep GTL realistic on the 
time it takes to negotiate project documents (six to nine months) and to 
issue public equity (no limit if the markets turn bad).

John, Larry and I are developing a plan to move GTL to a realistic structure. 
We may need your help with Phillips. We will keep you apprised. 

Jim

Mike,

It is my understanding that the office of the chairman will be distributing 
the attached memorandum to all employees on June 7.  Furthermore, it appears 
that the policy committee recommended that business unit heads send e-mails 
to their staffs, echoing and supporting these recommendations.  We would be 
pleased to prepare a draft for your consideration, if you would like to send 
out such an e-mail to the EGM staff.

John

Subject: Meeting with NWS at LNG 13 - Followup

Today, I spoke to Greg Veitch (Shell's representative to NWS) about an 
upcoming meeting.  During the call, he asked me about Mike McConnell's 
comment at the LNG 13 meeting that we were concerned about some of NWS' 
consortium partners and how they viewed a potential sale of LNG to Enron.   
He was concerned that Enron was inferring that Shell or BP somehow interfered 
with the process that NWS had instituted in evaluting the bids they received 
for the wedge cargoes.  I told him that I didn't know what exactly Mike meant 
but that it was probably more in the context of Shell and BP being global LNG 
competitors of Enron and not to the specific process around the wedge deal.  
I also told him that I was quite comfortable with the process that NWS used 
in evaluting the wedge cargo proposals and that I didn't see any issues (i.e. 
we assume that Shell put in the best proposal for NWS both on price and 
flexibility and that the final evaluation was made by all partners except 
Shell and BP).  

I've gotten to know Greg quite well over the past year and he told me off the 
record that Shell's bid was quite a bit better in terms of price (he implied 
about 15-20 cents higher) and flexibility (basically no call back premiums).  
This is something I have also been able to confirm indepedently with our 
contacts at Mitsubishi and BHP.   Once we lost MetGas as a potential 
discharge point for the wedge cargoes,  Shell had an advantage over us 
because of access to Cove Point's higher basis differential and access to a 
larger shipping fleet.    This underscores the point that Enron will find it 
difficult to compete on Price and Flexibility on merchant deals in the near 
term.  Our ability to develop proprietary global market outlets supported up 
by a critical mass in shipping will be the key to developing a viable LNG 
business.

Subject: InfrastructureWorld.com--Memo from Larry Izzo

Please read the attached memo from Larry Izzo. He is obviously wanting to 
resurface Infrastructure World.  As you will note in the last paragraph, he 
is basically staking out a position that EECC is going to have to spend $2 
million on project management software development and  that he can capture 
free optionality of doing a deal with infrastructure world.

On the surface of it, this does not make sense on several dimensions:

1. It is not clear to me why EECC has to spend $2 million on project 
management software development. By definition, such software would want to 
be collaborative  and I don't understand the logic of why we would do it 
ourselves.

2. If there is a seperate carve-out of project management software that is 
required for what we do that is separate from what existing functionality of 
Cepren, Buzzsaw and Bidcom is doing; we may have an opportunity to do joint 
development with any of these players. The question is picking who we think 
would be a winner and figuring out if there is a deal to be done. Allan and 
Drew, together with the EECC, have orchestrated meetings next week with these 
three companies to figure out ways that EECC may be able to work together 
with one of them. I would note that Bechtel is an investor in Cephren so it 
is not clear that they expected these to entities to be directly competitive. 
It is not clear that Infrastructure World is preferable to one of these other 
alternatives.

3. It is obviously not my call as to whether EECC needs or will spend $2 
million for Project Management software development (although I am 
skeptical). From an investment perspective, there has not been that much that 
has progressed on Infrastructure World in the last six to eight weeks. The 
principal change has been a significant revaluation  and critical assessment 
of B2B business plans and particularly revenue models. I would thus say that 
two months ago my assessment given the Bechtel/Hull involvement that there 
was a 75% ability to do legitimate VC at $5 to $10 million pre-money (as 
opposed to the $15 million that it was done at). I would say that the 
probability would be 25% of $5 to $10 million with significant risk of doing 
subsequent rounds. I would thus have a view that we should pass from an 
investment perspective.

I have left Larry a voice mail that I am available to meet when I am back 
Thursday and Friday when I am back from my father's funeral. I will have a 
discussion along these points. I am on vacation next week , but  told Larry 
in the voice mail that the alternative is to meet with Allan (who is out this 
week) and one of the people from my team.

Hi Mary Anne -

I am responding to your message on behalf of Mike McConnell.  Mike is in 
Singapore at this time and we are not sure if he will be successful in 
dialing up to catch up on his e-mail correspondence.  

Thank you very much for your message.  We solicit one time lump-sum 
contributions to JDF rather than per mile.  In addition, we collect the 
pledges for the walk - rain or shine.  The reason of course is that our main 
goal is to raise money to find a cure and we would prefer that weather or 
other elements beyond our control not impact our ability to raise funds.  
However, we have a great time on walk day and we have a lot of people turn 
out for the walk.  This year we are anticipating in excess of 500 walkers.  
The total amount of donations that are turned in by Enron employees are very 
generously matched dollar-for-dollar by the Enron Foundation.  Therefore, the 
matching forms are not necessary.  

If you happen to be in Houston on November 5th we would enjoy having you join 
us for the walk.  If you care to make a donation, it may be mailed to Mike at 
the following address:

 Mike McConnell
 Enron Global Markets
 1400 Smith Street, EB 3328
 Houston, TX  77002

If you donate $25 or more you are entitled to an Enron/JDF Walk T-shirt.  If 
you are interested just send us your size (M-L-XL-XXL) and location and we 
will get one to you.

Thanks again.

Hi Mike -
Saw your announcement regarding the walk on wEBSource.  Although I don't have 
the funds to fly down to Houston to participate, I'd be happy to at least 
make a donation!  How are the donations tallied?  Pledge per mile walked?  
Lump sum contribution?  Let me know!

I too am an insulin dependant diabetic - for 32 years now - and do know what 
a child goes through when diagnosed with this disease.  I just thank God that 
I have parents that instilled a strong sense of self and urged me to 
understand as much about the disease as possible.  I've seen too many kids 
and young adults, in my association with the Oregon Chapter of the JDF, that 
didn't understand and didn't want to deal with their diabetes - some of them 
dying at a very young age due to complications.  I volunteer my time to talk 
to newly diagnosed diabetic children, so they and their parents can 
understand that it isn't a death sentence, it's a way of life.  And a way of 
life that can be long and productive.

Here's wishing you the best in your endeavors on the JDF's behalf.

Best regards,
Mary Anne

My sincerest thanks to all of you that were able to attend the JDF Kick-off 
Luncheon on September 6th.  It was a great event and a wonderful opportunity 
for those of you not familiar with JDF to find out what the JDF Walk is all 
about.  For those of you that were not able to join us, we missed you and we 
look forward to having you join us for our future sessions.

The Enron/JDF Team Leaders Kick-off Luncheon will take place on Wednesday, 
September 13th, at the Houston Metropolitan Racquet Club (The Met) beginning 
at 11:30 a.m.  I would like to encourage each of you to mark your calendar 
and make plans to attend this very important luncheon meeting.  At this 
kick-off meeting we will be distributing supplies and gift bags, reviewing 
important details about our campaign, learning more about JDF, and discussing 
our fundraising goal for this year's campaign.  Enron has been the number 1 
walk team in Houston for 5 years in a row and we plan to continue in that 
position and we need your help to make it happen!  

Please take just a moment to RSVP your attendance via e-mail to Rachel Feldt 
on the Corporate Lotus Notes directory or to rachel.feldt@enron.com.

The Steering Committee members for this year's campaign are listed below.  
Please feel free to contact me or any Steering Committee member if you have 
any questions or if you have friends that you would like to sign up to help 
with our campaign.

Privileged and Confidential Attorney-Client Communication

Mike Brown, David Terlip, Janice Moore and I met today.  Plan is for Mike to 
get an answer from Siemens (probably this week or next) on spec.  If Siemens 
amenable to relax First Gas' spec to plant, request First Gas to relax it's 
spec to us.  Mike will report to you as soon as he has heard from Siemens.   
If either Siemens or First Gas recalcitrant, move to litigation strategy.  
This would mean at next cargo delivery (due mid-November):  (1)  if cargo 
"off spec" demand separate test using "ashing" technique (more likely to 
pass) and if it passes using "ashing" declare on spec and arbitrate dispute 
over acceptance of "ashing" as industry standard; (2) if cargo rejected 
(either because First Gas refuses to accept "ashing" or because off spec even 
with "ashing") resale cargo and force First Gas to locate alternative 
supplies; dispute First Gas invoice for cost of cover.   Mike mentioned a 
possible dispute over storage which could also arise with the next delivery.  
This could bring us into a dispute with First Gas even if the cargo is on 
spec.

Our plan is to get back to you in any event next week when you return with a 
status report.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Cheers.  And congratulations on the Sooners' win.

Mark,  

Attached is the information you requested for your presentation to the 
analysts.  I didn't know exactly what you were looking for, so I listed out a 
lengthy laundry list of facts and philosophies for each group for you to pick 
and choose what information and style that you wanted.  I didn't attempt to 
put this in a final set of dot points.  I realize that this is a lot more 
than what you wanted but I didn't know your other pieces or what was needed 
to be consistent with the other sections of the presentation.

I hope this is what you were looking for and i apologize for the delay.  If 
you want anything else or more specific types of other information, please 
let me know via email or preferably via voicemail in Houston.  I'll be 
Singapore until Wed. evening when I arrive in Toyko.  I am 13 hours ahead of 
Houston time.

Thanks and have a good trip.  Let me know if you want me to look at a draft 
copy.

Mike

PS;  good luck with Eric "boy do i want to be in LNG" Gonzelas

I would like to get together early next week and discuss the LNG group's 
assessment of our ability to remarket some of the Dabhol LNG.  We will soon 
likely be engaged with the Indian government in "discussions" of the Dabhol 
PPA.  I want to start formulating what proposals we feel comfortable putting 
on the table.  Your group's views on LNG will be critical.  We need not just 
"opinions" or "impressions", but an assessment of what risk we are willing to 
take (if any) in respect of some of the LNG volumes.  My secretary Connie 
Blackwood (x67421) can put a time on my calendar convenient to you and anyone 
else that needs to participate.

Jonny,

Thank you so much for the email and kind words.  I was very moved by it and
you know I feel the same way.  I have become very reflective with the more
"success" that I have been fortunate enough to receive.  I am so thankful
and appreciative and although I have always been religious and spiritual,
it has grown more deeply.  I see so many people that have lost their
perspective and I pray that I will remain grounded and truly appreciate the
blessings that our family has received.  Chris and I often discuss how we
can help others and what can we do to really make a difference.

The Jones and the McConnells are truly very lucky.   Thanks, and give my
love to your family.

Mike


PS:  What about OU - Texas, do you have any ideas or plans already in the
works?

Sometimes we fail to stop and reflect on events which are of significance
because we are so busy with our heads down accomplishing the things we
strive for.  I hope you are taking a moment to reflect and enjoy the
incredible accomplishments which you have achieved at such a young age.
You
and I are two of the luckiest people in the world and must always remember
to give back what we have been so fortunate to receive.

Congratulations and keep up the good work.  I am proud to call you my

Steve,

Sorry I missed you yesterday.  There is a lot going on here and in S America 
and we can probably discuss it next week.  I agree with your assessment of 
and the need to clarify roles and implement the business plan.   We will 
address all but there are some things going on that make it appropriate to 
wait a little.  If you have any questions you can address them with Joe but I 
would wait and keep moving forward on your daily business and projects.

I like the plan and we will discuss my comments next week.  

Thanks,
mike

I am in most of next week.

Jeff:

As I am sure you are aware, we are facing some significant challenges with 
the Dabhol project.  The government is making noise about reviewing the 
project and our customer is facing significant financial stress.  The plant 
runs on LNG that is indexed to JCC, effectively giving our customer a 
significant crude oil exposure.  As we consider a workout proposal, one thing 
that I have considered is the possibility of embedding some crude oil 
protection into the workout structure.  I would greatly appreciate it if I 
could borrow a few minutes of your time to (i) get a sense of where we see 
forward pricing right now and (ii) share with you our thoughts on the workout.

Jim

George, 

Thanks for the email.  Congrats on the getting non-binding bid, I think.  
When we get a chance, after Sempra closes, please set up a meeting with all 
of us and Frevert to discuss in detail.  Also include Jeff Donahue. You are 
aware of my concerns and issues and we need to discuss them in great detail 
before we move forward with Pacificorp.

Mike

Subject: Pacificorp - Synfuel

Pacificorps' board has given the ok for their capital division to negotiate 
with us on an exclusive basis for the sale of the 4 - synfuel machines they 
currently own and operate in Alabama.  Pacificorp advertises that each 
machine is capable of producing synfuel at the annual rate of 1.5 - 2.0 mm 
tons,  for a total of 6 - 8 mm annual tons.  

We will meet with Pacificorp early next week in Portland to discuss a due 
diligence schedule and ground rules for the sale.  We will obviously require 
one or more qualified monetizers to work with us on this deal from day one.  
If we line up more then one monetizer it would be helpful if we appoint a 
single monetizer to be the lead, otherwise we may end up facing conflicting 
demands from each monetizer.

Our ideal structure would have the monetizers immediately owning 100% of the 
equity in the machines, while we provide the sites, coal supply, and synfuel 
sales.  We need to work with the monetizers to identify qualified operators, 
while not taking any operating risk ourselves.

Given the "lease"  issue surrounding the Sempra deal, we need to make sure we 
structure Pacificorp (and AIG) as a mtm deal.  

We currently have a site team that has identified appropriate sites, and is 
starting the preliminary engineering and permitting work on each site.  The 
sites include river terminals and mines in West Virginia and Kentucky.

We expect to finalize Sempra this week ( 2 - machines on an accrual basis).   
"Team Synfuel" will then focus their activities on AIG (3 - machines) and 
Pacificorp (4 - machines) in order to close at least one of the deals by the 
end of October.  Our goal remains to secure 4 - 6 machines by the end of the 
year.

Subject: Western Coal Conference


Mike:

I enjoyed your remarks and meeting you after your speech.  I remain quite
interested in your comment that Enrononline expects to trade more coal that
natural gas or electricity in the future.

As we discussed, we are the dominant software fossil fuel developers in the
generating space, having our operating systems installed in 23 of the
largest generating companies.  The largest of our customers are also the
largest consumers of coal, and include TVA, Southern, AEP, First Energy,
CP&L, Exelon, New Century/Excel, and Southern Energy, among others.  At
several of the companies' request, we have developed our Fuel Optimizer
Module (FPO), which tells the fuel buyer what the delivered cost to a plant
specific specifications is, once the coal cost is factored into the
equation.

Attached is an overview of our system, and the specs on the FPO.  Please
forward these on the appropriate people in your organization.  I look
forward to hearing from them.

Thank you for your time.

David

Kathie,

Thank you for your email.  I've been out and all over the world.  I 
appreciate your help on this article.  Attached is a copy of a presentation 
that will fill you in on some of the businesses that we are working on.  This 
should give you some ideas and clarifications on the first draft.

Here are a few other points of emphasis.

EGM was created to provide sharpened focus on very large global markets and 
commodities to enable them to grow quickly 
These markets are huge and we will become a big player rather than being 
active in them
EGM provideds true network for market making opportunities related to 
commodities that are highly liquid in physical and financial terms and are 
enormous in market size
EGM leverages the value of Enron's existing network and international asset 
positions
EGM's operation will coordinate with leveraging all of our wholesale 
businesses
EGM has very aggressive growth targets in transactions and earnings
EGM has contributed almost $200 million in gross margin in its first  2 
quarters in existence
Go big or go home philosophy
EGM will represent a clear transfer of  Enron wholesale market making model 
into other commodities this year
GROWTH is the key!!!


Thanks for your help.

Mike

Subject: ENSIDE Newsletter

Good Morning Mike!

The next issue of our newsletter is in the works, with a planned distribution 
set for late June. Mark Frevert has requested that the Executive Letter be 
rotated among the presidents of EWS. This is the inside cover message and 
should be 300+ words. I hope that you will be able to squeeze this into your 
busy schedule.

Here is a suggested outline.  If you want to fill in the outline with 
information, I will be happy to turn it into a letter for you.

 I.  An overview of EWS/EGM as we move forward.

 II. A short-term retrospective about EGM activities and successes

           III. Future plans/initiatives for EGM
     (strategic vision of the group, opportunities, expectations, etc.) 

Please feel free to modify as you see fit.  I have attached Greg Whalley's 
letter from our last issue to give you an idea of the format. Let me know if 
there is anything I can do to help you.  I need your letter by June 15, if 
possible.

 
Hope to hear from you soon.

Mark,

Attached, for your information, is  a copy of a general presentation that I 
prepared to illustrate and describe EGM's businesses.  This is a presentation 
that will become a "living" document to communicate our businesses and 
growth.  I will be making numerous changes as we move closer to the analyst 
meeting in January but I wanted to give everyone a copy of this version.

Please don't hesitate to call me if you have any questions or comments.

Dear Mr. McConnell:

I have been referred to you by a neighbor of mine, George Fastuca. I have
known George for approximately 18 months and when he heard I was looking to
do differently he strongly suggested I contact you. I am searching for a
position that will permit me to utilize the broad based business experience I
have acquired in commercial and investment banking, industry and public
accounting.

Most recently, I was Vice President for American Electric Power Energy
Services, a natural gas and electric power trading start up, responsible for
business development. As Senior Vice President of Capital Markets at Chase
Manhattan Bank, I launched an extremely successful derivative
products/structured finance business in Texas and contiguous states. At
Continental Bank, Citicorp and Motorola, Inc., I was responsible for a
variety of innovative marketing and financial initiatives which included
establishing new businesses, restructuring existing businesses and
refinancing established or newly acquired businesses.

Attached is a copy of my resume. Qualities which have contributed to my
success are:

? Entrepreneurial. 3 of my last 4 positions were start ups or turnarounds.
Experience with early stage ventures and acquisition identification.
? Partnership. Ability to build strong relationships by providing solid
counsel and negotiating skills. Established and maintained excellent working
relationships with other senior operating managers.
? General Management. Have held full P&L responsibilities. Established
policies, programs and procedures to achieve growth objectives, including
recruitment, evaluation and development of personnel.
? Core Competencies. Development and refinement of organization
infrastructure, including external marketing, joint venture relationships,
internal operations management, strategic planning and new product
development. Have identified and concluded acquisitions. International
experience.

I would appreciate the opportunity to speak with you about opportunities at
Enron. I will call Cathy this Friday to see if there is an appropriate time
when we may speak next week.

Sincerely,

Michael E. Fitzgerald

As we move forward with our global LNG strategy, it is obvious that the best 
way to capture value for Enron is to bring the same merchant activity to this 
business unit.  This merchant philosophy allows aggressive book and position 
management from a worldwide perspective.  Our ability to gather data and to 
show only one Enron face in the market is crucial to our success.  As 
important is one pricing desk.  Many of you know, Eric Groves in Houston is 
running our pricing desk, Larry Lawyer is working on all finance type 
business for us, and Jen Fraser is running our fundamentals group.  

To bring full merchant capabilities to our worldwide LNG business, Mike and I 
wanted to clearly outline a point that seems to need attention.  ALL LNG 
contacts, negotiations, and contracts, (physical, financial, buys, sales, 
etc.), with external counterparties must and will be managed through our 
commercial LNG group headed by Eric Gonzales, and Rick Bergsieker.  

It is crucial to manage market perspective, appearance, and informantion.  We 
all know how important each project (Metgas, and other initiatives in India) 
could be, but a coordinated front will help us better grow all of our 
businesses.

Regards

Jeff

6.1 says when FG becomes aware of changes it "shall" (so its mandatory) 
inform us "as soon as practicable" after it becomes aware.  But then it says 
these are "good faith estimates" and are not to give rise to any liability on 
FG.  These two provisions seem inconsistent to me.   I think we should demand 
that FG pay.  Our odds of winning on the point in arbitration are 50/50 
(would hinge on what was parties' intent as reflected in negotiations).

Comments from John in singapore.  raises this issue that they give us their 
requirements and we MUSTmeet their requirements. On the other hand if their 
requirements change we are responsible for demurrage , reselling or any other 
actions which must be taken . Bob is this your understanding, or once they 
give us their requirements they are responsible for costs incurred for any 
changes due to a change in their requirements?

This is good news to me.  Hope that Siemen's does come thru and then we can 
force the issue with FGH and show that they are being unreasonable in their 
demand on the specs we currently have.  

As to next delivery, the cargo just left ytdy and will arrive Batangas on  
the 7th.  Sample of the shore tanks prior to loading was flown to Sing and 
tested using Ashing. Metals and everything was OK.  We were rerunning last 
night using direct injection.  Haven't seen those results yet. 

As to storage issue.  Yes, we have seen some correspondence from FGH saying 
that the cargo would not fit. Expect that it should just become an issue over 
demurrage liability - ours vs FGH . However, you never know with this John 
Russel guy - if the mkt were to fall away he could try to say he wants a 
different price on the balance of the cargo. Expect it to price out at close 
to $35/bbl.   We loaded minimum volume so a bit of a hit on frt.  As of ytdy 
it looked like the ullage was going to be short by 8 to 15kbbls.  If so we 
will be liable for demurrage.   Another point of interest on this one is in 
all their forecasts they show usage everyday during the week.  However, ytdy 
we hear from the Plant that they expect minimum usage (possibly zero) over 
the next two days due to religious holidays - All Saints.  If so then the we 
will probably go to about 30kbbls short of ullage and demmurage will increase 
from a possible 4 days to 8 days @ $23k/day.  Could this be construed as 
possible false info?

Privileged and Confidential Attorney-Client Communication

Mike Brown, David Terlip, Janice Moore and I met today.  Plan is for Mike to 
get an answer from Siemens (probably this week or next) on spec.  If Siemens 
amenable to relax First Gas' spec to plant, request First Gas to relax it's 
spec to us.  Mike will report to you as soon as he has heard from Siemens.   
If either Siemens or First Gas recalcitrant, move to litigation strategy.  
This would mean at next cargo delivery (due mid-November):  (1)  if cargo 
"off spec" demand separate test using "ashing" technique (more likely to 
pass) and if it passes using "ashing" declare on spec and arbitrate dispute 
over acceptance of "ashing" as industry standard; (2) if cargo rejected 
(either because First Gas refuses to accept "ashing" or because off spec even 
with "ashing") resale cargo and force First Gas to locate alternative 
supplies; dispute First Gas invoice for cost of cover.   Mike mentioned a 
possible dispute over storage which could also arise with the next delivery.  
This could bring us into a dispute with First Gas even if the cargo is on 
spec.

Our plan is to get back to you in any event next week when you return with a 
status report.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Cheers.  And congratulations on the Sooners' win.

John,

We have discussed i2 in the past  but we need to take some action steps to 
make decisions and move forward.  Here is what I want to see done in short 
order.

Meeting with all key technologist on the full suite of products and 
functionality with complete demonstration by i2.  I would especially want PB, 
JP, BP, HE, and JG from George's group.
Follow-up meeting (after the technologists see functionality and form 
opinions and possible applications) with key commercial leaders:  GP -  P&P; 
TG - CommodityLogic; BG - Metals and steel;  JF - New Markets and 
Investments; AS - New Markets and Bus Dev.  During that meeting, we need to 
have some real players with i2 there to brainstorm and discuss business 
expansion opportunities in the specific verticals.  It would be good to 
actually have this meeting in Dallas but I am concerned about attendance.  i2 
owns the process and supply/downstream management in these industries and we 
need to really look to see if our combination can accelerate our new efforts 
and solve any logistic issues.
Put together an action plan.  George's group has already put a presentation 
together about i2, the products and possible applications.  George, please 
sent that to John.  I would like that document to be our updated business 
plan for i2 to be used as a "living" document as we move forward.
Assign someone to make and co-ordinate the use and full deployment of those 
products (utilize our $10 million spend).  I want someone to have the 
responsibility for i2 and he or she can also work with EBS on what they are 
doing also.  To be clear, we have spent the $10 million already but are not 
using the products.  I want to deploy all (if possible) and make this 
investment fully utilized.  I do understand that we don't drive businesses 
around a pre-purchased product but we should look at is as a sunk cost and 
rationalize why we shouldn't use if rather that simply considering it as an 
option.
Jason Robert, (469) 357-6737, was at the dinner with Sanjiv, Greg Brady, Jeff 
and Greg and he knows some of the mutual objectives.  He would be the guy to 
work with and set it all up.
EBS should be involved as well.  Rex Shelby is spending a lot of time with 
i2, weekly visits, and should also participate and use their products as well.
Is there an application for all of EES and their business?
Remember, Ken Lay is considering joining their board and we should be able to 
give him very clear insight on their products and how their company works.
PB, if you want someone outside Pavetto's group  to work on this that is fine 
but i want to understand the background and how they will make this happen. 


Thanks and please let me know your initial thoughts and timing.  If you need 
to have me send out an email to make sure that everyone understands the 
priority, please draft up and I'll send out.

Mike

but now i think we will fly in on Tues early afternoon and mess around Miami 
and therefor  may want to stay closer to the city.  Any thoughts?  When are 
you guys flying in?

Lea, 

You called yesterday.  I am swamped and unavailable.  On Jeff Koons, I am 
sure that Jeff talked with you last week and he shared his insight from other 
dealers at your dinner and his comments.  It sounds like we should let him go 
and not pursue.  I was going to talk with Skilling that day and elected to 
drop it after that.  See you on Monday.

Attached is the update for today, which corresponds with my voicemail that I 
left this evening.  I should have more content gathered for tomorrow's 
update.  

Also as an FYI, I did email the draft of the New Orientation presentation (on 
a blue background) to Celeste for review first thing this AM.  

I will be in touch.

Cathy, before I forget, would you please make a tee time of approx. 1pm for 4 
people at the golf course at the Four Seasons under my name (friday).  Also 
if you would set up massages for Brenda Jones and Chris at about the same 
time or later.  I would really appreciate it.  All can be a little later but 
cant be any earlier.  We need to begin golf by 2pm to finish.
thanks,
m

Marty,

I can't attend and sent it on to Jeff Shankman.  I really like the concept 
and would like to see the end product and the presentations.  Are you taping 
it?  

Its a great idea and format.  Thanks for inviting me.

Jeff, 

Sorry for the slow response.  

I don't have a strong opinion either way.  I am fine with the combo idea.

In the future, please let me know if something has a short fuse.  I am still 
slower on email but I do respond very quickly to voicemail.  I am almost 
caught up on back log emails but this will probably never by my first and 
best way to communcate.

Thanks,
Mike

I see that we are scheduled to have lunch today.   I may have to postpone 
again, I'll let you know later this morning.  I am out all weekend and we 
have to have the final comments on the Analyst Presentation in by sunday 
night so I may be working over lunch.  Actually, I think we are in pretty 
good shape so I will probably be doing lunch but just don't be too mad if I 
have to cancel.

PS  Your brother told me he went to 3 bowl games (when I found out that two 
of them were the galleryfurniture.com bowl and that one in Shreveport (I 
can't remember the name of it)) I realized he is a very, very sick college

Mike - I enjoyed your presentation  and comments about Enron Global Markets 
last week.
Your comment about being passionate about things which add value to the 
company is important for success at Enron was very helpful.

I am an originator in EIM for our pulp & paper businesses. I am starting 
business development effort in Asia for Pulp & Paper which I am very excited 
about. I will be in Asia visiting potential consumers and producers in major 
countries in Asia e.g., Japan, India, Singapore, Korea, Thailand, Australia 
and others.
I would like to know if you recommend someone in Enron offices in these 
countries who may have originated businesses with major pulp & paper clients 
for other products e.g., energy or other commodities. 
Thanks for your help in advance.

Would be good to see you.  We will be in the middle of our winter (~60-65 
degrees MaxT) in July.  Sydney has a relatively mild winter and there is 
still  all the regular sight seeing.  I will be here all month.  Timing would 
be good from a business perspective as we look to develop and assist with 
more EGM opportunities (e.g. grains).  Let me know firm timing and we can set 
an agenda.  btw Frevert was here last week and we had a great day on the 
harbour.

John,

I have just had some additional discussions on our Global weather business 
and have come to a decision on how we need to run the weather business.   I 
believe that we do  need 100% full time dedication from each and any employee 
that is dedicated to the weather business including in the overall 
development and execution of or global strategy and positions.   I have a 
great deal of confidence and am holding Mark Tawney responsible and 
accountable for extensive growth and profitability in the business.

We need to hire additional people to add to grow the business in Japan and 
Australia.  Joe and Paul are on board with this strategy and Mark will work 
with them to accomplish the hiring of people and needed resources.  This will 
not be talk but we will get these people in place by specific deadlines.  We 
will pay all of those people's expenses and they will be on board with the 
hiring and will be expected to be a valuable team player and resource to 
their group.

On the Norway front, we need to implement the same organization structure.  
We have talked a lot about Thor and better communication, but we need to make 
a change.  We will have weekly calls with him and the weather group to make 
sure that we are all on the same page and he is up to speed with where we are 
going.  Jeff did have a video call with Thor to talk about his email and it 
went well.  Upon my return I learned that Thor and the London group put out a 
press release about putting out pricing on 1,000 cities and even changing the 
index.  Neither Mark or Jeff were even aware of this event nor was it even 
brought up in the call as something that was going to happen.  Also the 
hiring of xxxxxx as a weather  originator, without any discussion, also 
illustrates the lack of communication or desire to work together.  I am not 
saying that Mark or Thor are totally to blame, they both deserve credit for 
not working together, but  we are going to change the future and make sure 
that it will work better.  I know that all of Thor's group is very loyal to 
Thor and may not want to transition into EGM and if that is the case, we can 
make it work via London.  I think the key is our approach to Thor and that 
this isn't meant as a reflection on him but is a consistent change with how 
we are running all of our businesses around the world.  The weather piece of 
his business is very small and isn't going to effect his P&L significantly 
(he'll actually be net positive!)

Please give me a call and we will discuss the issues surrounding this new 
structure and the best way to communicate it to those involved to make this 
the most effective.

This email is going just to you and Jeff and won't be shared with anyone else.

mike

Dear Mr McConnell

Thank you for your e-mail of the 20th October. I apologise for the slow
reply but I was travelling when it was received at the gallery.

I now have 'pointillist' colour works by Cross and Signac which might be of
interest to you. Both are from the collection of one of my clients.

The Signac is similar to the work that you liked on the website. The
details are:

Paul Signac Le Soir - Evening Jetty at Flessingue
Original lithograph in five colours. 1898. From the issued edition,
commissioned and issued by Meier Graefe for the album 'Pan', Berlin 1898.
Drawn and printed at the studio of Clot, Paris 1897/98. Ref: Kornfeld and
Wick Paul Signac Prints no 20, as completed and issued. Exceptionaly fine
and fresh impression with totally unfaded colours. On off-white chine
volant paper. Full margins. Image: 8 x 10 3/8ins. o2500 (US$ 3750)

There is no illustration of the Cross on the website. If you do not know
the image then we could arrange for a printout in colours to be sent to you
by Fedex (we do not currently have scan available for e-mail) but we would
need your full mailing address.

The details are as follows:

Henri Edmond Cross - In the Champs Elysees. Les Nourrices.
Original lithograph in colours. 1898. Numbered in pencil from the very
scarce de-luxe edition of 75 impressions. Prior to the regular issued
edition for the album. Commissioned and issued by Meier Graefe for 'Pan,

condition. Image: 7 7/8 x 10 1/4ins. o 2500 (US$3750)

I will look forward to hearing from you. Thank you for your interest in my
gallery

William Weston.

Rick, Obviously we want to control access to the LNG terminal.  I don't 
really understand why it is so difficult if we go to 50%, its a negotiation 
item. Or at least a cheap retention option not to be given away for free.  
After your follow-up meetings, please let me know if we need to get more 
involved.

Mike/Jeff:  per your instructions, we have taken a look at Enrion India's 
plans regarding selldown of DPC/.Metgas to determine what impact this could 
have on our LNG business.  The second paragraph of Wade's note below sums up 
the current situation.  Bottom  line, if Metgas is sold down by Enron India 
from 100% to 50%, we would lose the right to control unilaterally decisions 
related to the use of the Dabhol LNG terminal.  I don't know how much someone 
may be willing to pay for Metgas, but I suspect that at this time it is a 
relatively small number when compared to the strategic value of controlling 
this terminal

We will discuss next week when we are in India.  Please advise if youhave any 
thoughts or suggestions

Subject: RE: Investment Opportunity/Dabhol Power Company  

Rick, we can discuss this more at length in Mumbai this coming week. Metgas 
is the only company that has any access to DPC's terminal. As you know, DPC 
is owned today by Enron (65), MSEB (15), GE (10) and Bechtel (10). At year 
end, Enron's 65 will be split to Enron (50) and new investor (15). Any 
changes to the terminal or the TARA have to be approved by DPC, which is 
heavily influenced, but not controlled, by Enron.

The real asset that Enron has today is the TARA, and Enron has this through 
Metgas. Under the TARA, Metgas has right to have DPC regassify any gas that 
Metgas delivers to DPC. In addition, Metgas has rights to increase size of 
terminal at its cost. So whoever owns and controls Metgas is who has the real 
value here. Today, Metgas is 100% owned and controlled by Enron, so Enron has 
control. But in any sale of Metgas, Enron's control will be lessened. Under 
current plans to avoid debt consolidation, we will reduce Enron's equity 
position to 50% or less, which means we are at best sharing control with 
someone else, or maybe a group of someone else's. If Enron is uncomfortable 
with this because it views access to Metgas terminal as part of larger LNG 
role, we should discuss ASAP.

AG -- please allow time on Wednesday's agenda to discuss these issues with 
Rick and Clay.

Wade

Bill/Wade:  I would like to understand how DPC/Metgas selldown will impact 
Enron's ability to control acces to the DPC LNG terminal.  If an LNG 
competitor buys in (e.g., Total or British Gas or Shell) could they block our 
acces to the terminal?

Clay,

As you know, we are selling portions of both Dabhol and Metgas.  For fuel 
supply, they can supply Nahptha to Dabhol and LNG to Metgas.  They will have 
BOD positions pro rata with their ownership.   Finally, in the case of 
Dabhol, there are significant minority shareholder protections given the way 
the the various voting procedures are designed.  I am not as familiar with 
the Metgas voting procedures, but there is certainly the opportunity to 
negotiated something there since it is still in development.  Also, there 
should be attractive commercial returns with each project.

I feel that these opportunities certainly meets their investment criteria.  
If they are interested, we need to get them up to speed quickly.

Call me or let me know how you want to proceed on this.


Bill

Clay,
Thanks for the information on DPC. IPIC's current focus on India is to
identify investments with related crude, naphtha or gas supply needs which
could be filled by Adnoc or Adgas, with priority currently assigned to
Adnoc's naphtha. IPIC would also be looking for a commercial return, BOD
participation & strong minority shareholder protection. Does the DPC
opportunity fit this profile? If so IPIC could certainly look at it...

Best Regards

Dave Forbes

Subject: Need your help representing your Analysts

As you probably know, the Western Hemisphere A&A PRC will be held in Houston 
on July 19th.  Each member of the PRC committee will represent 15 to 17 
analysts that have been randomly assigned. I've been selected as a member of 
the Analyst PRC Committee representing participants that are under your 
direct supervision.  As a PRC rep, I will continue to represent the assigned 
Analysts (see list below) during their entire tenure with the Analyst Program.

Thus, I need your help in supplying me performance information for these 
candidates (including pre-ratings if available) and recommendations for 
promotion if he or she is eligible.  In addition, for those of you based out 
of Houston I'd like to meet with each of you individually (15 or 20 minutes 
should be enough) during the 17th and the 18th of July (if you are not based 
out of Houston or you'll be out of town during those days, we can certainly 
do it over the phone the week of the 10th.
I'm based out of Sao Paulo (in transition from Buenos Aires) and I'll be 
landing in Houston the morning of the 17th, so I'll be ready to begin these 
short meetings by 11am on the 17th.  I would very much appreciate if you can 
indicate your time preference for those two days. 

FYI, the following is the list of participants that I'll be representing in 
the July 19th PRC meeting:

Analyst Name    Supervisor
Ahanchian, Amir Cyrus    Humphrey, Gene
Allen, Margaret     Palmer, Mark
Ashmore, Garrett    Cox, David    
Benien, Michael     Moscoso, Michael

Mena, Luis     Leibert, Richard
O'Malley, Justin     Pittenger, Cathy
Scarborough, John    Courtney, Mark
Vegalara, Mateo    Thomsen, Jon


Please call me at 5511-5503-1397 in Sao Paulo or at 5411-4891-3600 in Buenos 
Aires.  It will be of enormous help if you can let us know the name and 
telephone number of your assistants so Marianne Arake (Sao Paulo 
5511-5503-1197) and/or Nadia Rodriguez (Buenos Aires 5411-4891-3644) can 
follow up on the schedule in Houston.

Thanks for your co-operation.

Subject: Air Cargo Capacity Trading at Enron

Hello Louise:

I recently authored a white paper, giving some background on the air cargo 
business for Enron Net Works.  In the paper, I identified the hurdles we 
would need to overcome in order to create a market for trading air cargo 
capacity futures, none of which were deemed insurmountable.  I further 
suggested that Enron could approach this business by leveraging EOL to act as 
a non vessel owning common carrier, trading physical capacity while readying 
the market (and ourselves!) for financial trading.

I am very interested in moving this business idea along here within Net 
Works.  I have some ideas regarding likely industry partners that could move 
us along rather quickly.  I think the logical next step may be to get with 
you or with someone on your staff to begin some dialog with the eventual goal 
of creating a business plan.  Any thoughts?

Thanks!

Subject: The Pulse - Distribution List Schedule

As you know, Andrea Yowman will be coordinating the distribution lists for 
the Pulse survey in October.  Attached is the most up to date schedule that 
she has generated as a basis for working on those lists.  I am suggesting she 
send the lists to the HR head for each group so that you can decide whom you 
want to review and approve them.


As mentioned in my earlier email to you, please contact Andrea directly with 
any questions you may have about the lists including how to separate out 
those who will receive paper and pencil, how to handle those not on 
electronic distribution systems, etc.

Cindy, I don't think we have a fit here but would you please follow-up and 
let him know that we looked around and couldn't find anything.  Also please 
forward to other groups as well.

Thanks for the quick follow-up. My background is in the sales, marketing, 
strategic planning and M&A areas in the industrial sector. Do not know if 
there is a fit, but I had hoped to explore possibilities with you.

Louise,

I do agree.  I haven't really looked at or studied the plan because of the 
pending changes.  There are some good guys down there and I believe they can 
do some good work to help you in your quest for world domination.  Good luck 
with this.

Cheers,

Subject: Re: Draft Business Plan Enron Net Works South America  

I think there is some duplication from these guys internal to Argentina.  As 
you know we had a visit from Patrick Hansen, Bastos and Mike Guerriero 
recently where I think we agreed on the concept behind www.enron.ar - ie 
using our vertical concept.

I think Steve and the team who came here probably need to get on the same 
page as the presentation doesn't quite reflect where we (Dave Forster)  
thought they were going.  

We are not worried if they want to go that way - the budget plans are way out 
of line though (but they do need to tell us to stop the development we are 
doing for them).

Dave, if Mike agrees - the easiest thing to do would be for you to ring Steve.

Louise

All,

FYI, here is the latest draft of their business plan for your review and 
commentary.  I had the video call yesterday and went through all the org 
changes.  I did not provide any commentary on the specifics for obvious 
reasons.

Subject: Re: Draft Business Plan Enron Net Works South America  


I think there are 2 principal drivers:

(1)  the respective Business Unit heads inside of Networks (Houston or 
elsewhere ) need to know who Steve and I are, that we're involved and that we 
have a  mandate ( actually this probably warrants some clarification 
vis-a-vis the Argentine office, as well; especially given the hiring of 
Bastos - I for one would like  to get a clear and substantive understanding 
in regard to his trading background, priority for physical vs. financial 
products, and expectations ) and
(2)  we (Enron SA) need an invitation, but also need to probably be more 
aggressive about participating in meetings, discussions - both strategic 
and   functional for each of  the Business Units

Once we reach a consensus on an Enron SA Bus Plan with focus, targets will 
establish some parameters to participate inside the group going forward.  

Mike, your efforts to communicate both updating events vis-a-vis the weekly 
call and overtures outside the group have been a great initiative and much 
appreciated.  It's made an important, productive impression on Enron 
employees "outside"of Networks.  Look forward to further discussions all 
around.

Subject: Draft Business Plan Enron Net Works South America

Mike,

Per your request, attached is the draft Business Plan for South America. Due 
to agenda constraints, Joe Kishkill has not yet had the opportunity to review.

As part of structuring the regional effort, it would be important to 
streamline and coordinate the due diligence and market study efforts. There 
appears to be some confusion between Houston and S?o Paulo over who is 
responsible for what. We may need to formally announce D'Arcy's and my roles, 
including the need to channel information through us into and out of the 
region.

Please let us know your thoughts.

Thanks, Steve

Lisa, 

As i was pondering the meeting last night going home in my car, I realized 
that I forgot to talk about 2 people,  including regulatory and your personal 
efforts.  I apologize for that, it was unintentional and I hope you realize 
how important you and your efforts are to EGM and Enron.  I could not read my 
notes very well due to the extremely heavy lighting - that didn't appear on 
my notes just on me.

Thanks,
Mike

Stuart,

A quick second follow up.  I talked again with Cindy Olson and she has 
discussed the issue in detail with the Astros organization.  They are going 
to think about this and examine for next season.  They did say that this was 
the first time this was brought up but they want to be sensitive and will 
consider at change.

Thanks for bringing this to my attention.

All,

 At our offsite in Miami next week, each of you are on the agenda to present 
your business and goals.  This will be very short, only 20 minutes (an agenda 
will soon follow but we will have a business meeting from 8am - 11:30am on 
Saturday).  Please prepare a few of pages on power point and submit to Cathy 
Phillips so that she can have all the presentations ready for that Saturday 
morning.  

Attached below is a copy of the abbreviated goals that I submitted to 
Frevert, summarizing EGM's 2001 goals.  Please do not hesitate to change the 
list and add to it, it is only a guide and was used as a quick reference of 
EGM for the Enron board.  After this meeting, I will take each of your 
presentations and make a more comprehensive goals and objectives list for EGM 
as a business unit.  Also please add some of your other specific goals that 
illustrate where you want to be by year end regarding your competitive 
position and/or market share.  For example, to be the largest marketer of 
coal in the US, to be the largest options player in crude and products, or 
what ever is appropriate.

Also attached, for your information, is a recent  presentation from the coal 
group.  We thought that this was an excellent format and review.  In the 
upcoming weeks, we would like to see an update on each of your businesses as 
well.  I will let you know more in the next few weeks about the timing and 
format.

Thanks,
Mike

Rick/Mike,

Recent organizational changes in India. Please note new point of coordination 
for LNG and Global Markets. Looks like they have a fairly large group to look

Thank you all for signing up to be Team Leaders for our JDF Campaign this 
year.  The first Enron JDF/Team Leader Luncheon is today, Wednesday, 
September 13th, at 11:30 a.m. at the Met.  This will be a very important and 
informative session and I hope that everyone will attend.  

I look forward to seeing you at the luncheon.

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

My sincerest thanks to all of you that were able to attend the JDF Kick-off 
Luncheon on September 6th.  It was a great event and a wonderful opportunity 
for those of you not familiar with JDF to find out what the JDF Walk is all 
about.  For those of you that were not able to join us, we missed you and we 
look forward to having you join us for our future sessions.

The Enron/JDF Team Leaders Kick-off Luncheon will take place on Wednesday, 
September 13th, at the Houston Metropolitan Racquet Club (The Met) beginning 
at 11:30 a.m.  I would like to encourage each of you to mark your calendar 
and make plans to attend this very important luncheon meeting.  At this 
kick-off meeting we will be distributing supplies and gift bags, reviewing 
important details about our campaign, learning more about JDF, and discussing 
our fundraising goal for this year's campaign.  Enron has been the number 1 
walk team in Houston for 5 years in a row and we plan to continue in that 
position and we need your help to make it happen!  

Please take just a moment to RSVP your attendance via e-mail to Rachel Feldt 
on the Corporate Lotus Notes directory or to rachel.feldt@enron.com.

The Steering Committee members for this year's campaign are listed below.  
Please feel free to contact me or any Steering Committee member if you have 
any questions or if you have friends that you would like to sign up to help 
with our campaign.

Our relocation to the new building is fast approaching and there are several 
important move related items that I would like to stress at this time.  I 
would appreciate your cooperation with the key move issues that are outlined 
below:

IMPORTANT - A special building tour has been scheduled for the EGM business 
unit heads receiving this message.  Jeff and I, along with Bill Donovan, 
would like to invite you to join us for a tour on this Friday morning, June 
8th, from 8:30 to 9:30 a.m.  Even if you have already had an opportunity to 
visit the new building, we think this would be a great opportunity for all of 
us to see the space together and discuss any issues at that time.  Please 
contact Cathy Phillips at X-36898 if you plan to attend the tour.
New building floor plan modification requests will no longer be accepted.  
Any change requests that have already been received are currently being 
considered and will be conveyed to the appropriate business unit head.
If vacant positions exist and they will be filled before the move on August 
3rd, they need to be identified on all reports and floor plans with their 
name, NH (for new hire) and an approximate hire date.  Example:  Bob Smith NH 
7/25
Any space/move related questions or issues that may arise should be addressed 
by Cathy Phillips.  Please do not contact Susan Lopez for any space related 
issues.  Jeff and I have asked Cathy and Jennifer Burns to be responsible for 
the allocation of space in the new building and they are keeping us well 
informed as to the progress and any issues as they arise.
Jeff and I are very aware that space is very tight in the new building and we 
will be addressing growth and additional space needs and issues in the near 
future.
A limited number of Turret phones will be available in the new building.  The 
Turret phones will be assigned to traders and their assistants only.  
Everyone else on the floor will receive a new upgraded version of the Lucent 
phone (with the existing phone numbers).  Please contact Jennifer Burns if 
you have any questions or issues related to phones.
All private team rooms, offices and conference rooms have been assigned and 
there are no more available for assignment to the individual groups or 
people.  On the 3rd floor we will have the following public conference space 
available by making reservations (specific scheduling details to follow 
later):
1 Mega conference room
1 Large conference room with videoconference capabilities
1 Large conference room - no videoconference 
3 Team rooms
File space on the floor is being upgraded and allocations of file space will 
be made for each group.  Every attempt is being made to have the assigned 
file space as close to each individual group as possible.
At this time, details related to food deliveries and distribution have not 
been resolved.  Your patience and flexibility with all food related issues 
will be appreciated.  It is highly probable that food service in the new 
building will be very difficult at first and as we get closer to the move 
date, more information will be provided related to food service, deliveries 
and distribution.
Since Jeff and I both already keep Cathy and Jennifer very busy, we would 
appreciate it if you would send all your comments, questions, or issues to 
them via e-mail.  They have agreed to make themselves available every Monday 
at 4:30 p.m. to meet with anyone to discuss their questions.  Please make 
arrangements with them directly to meet regarding your issues.
There will be a 60 day freeze on any building changes once we move into the 
new building.

I understand that this is a difficult process and that there are a lot of 
questions and issues, but Jeff and I are convinced that this will be great 
and everything will work out in time.  Thank you for your cooperation and 
assistance in making this transition to the new building as smooth as 
possible.

Mike

Jeff,
I can't sleep and have been cleaning out emails.  Not my favorite past time 
at 2:30am.  I didn't see the draft reorg memo we've been talking about for a 
while.  Please send it to me for my review.  I think it is important to get 
something out and i believe that people expect some changes
Thanks, m.

Based on last weeks meeting and discussion between the team here and you it 
seems like you are moving toward
separating the non-Nordic region and headquartering it in London.  John 
Sherriff and I are comfortable with this and would like to 
move forward with the plan if at all possible effective April 1, 2001.  We 
would split the groups with one Nordic group here in Oslo, reporting back to 
Enron Europe, and one Team for the rest of Europe in London, reporting back 
to you.  I assume that we can arrange all technical and practical things to 
get this done as soon as possible.  Please give me a call to confirm your 
support (or not if we need to discuss further) and let's see how fast and 
smoothly we can get these changes made.

Regards 


Thor

Rick,

Attached for your information and input is a copy of a presentation I am 
putting together for EGM.  I would appreciate your comments on the 
presentation but especially need your input on your section.  The LNG page is 
on page 6 and needs some work.  there is also a typo.  On the graph, we need 
to find a way to illustrate our business graphically, what do you think?
 I would appreciate a quick turnaround of your initial changes.  After we 
complete this first draft, this will be a continuous work in progress.
Thanks,
Mike

Ron,

Hello.  I am back in the country -  I've been out for 2 weeks since I picked 
up the car.  I am very happy with the car and your contact treated me very 
well.  The transaction went smoothly and they worked with me to get the car 
before I went off to Asia.

I wanted to thank you again for all your help and efforts.   I have had many 
comments already and there is not doubt that this will lead to a new wave of 
Enron purchases of Mercedes.

 I am a Mercedes believer.

Sincerely,
Mike McConnell

PB,

I just talked with Cindy Olsen about the project.  We need to assign someone 
in our group to be the technology lead.  I know we have people on it but we 
need to pick someone to be responsible and then  clarify that person's role.  
Please get back to me with the selection.

Mike,

I am playing in the Rhubarb at Champions on the 28th with another guy I've 
played in several tournaments with.  However, they have switched the format 
this year to 3 man teams, and wondered if you have any interest.

Either give me a call 3-4278, or reply by e-mail.

Hope you have a merry Christmas.

Jimmie

This summarizes the near term delivery milestones for the Position Manager 
functionality within Thunderball.  

The first release of  Position Manager    ( Phase I )  within the Thunderball 
Moneypenny application is as follows for Liquids, Crude, Products and Coal  :

? Houston  UAT  (User Acceptance Test)  -- Week of May 7 through week of May 
14 . User acceptance test started today and is going well. 
 
? London UAT    (User Acceptance Test)    -- Week of May 14 through May 21

? Singapore UAT  (User Acceptance Test)      -- Week of May 21

Phase I full release will be complete by May 31 (all trader desktops)
The target is to deliver the following Phase 1 and Phase 2 functionality 
through the May / June time frame in a series of iterative releases.  

Phase I includes (Liquids, Crude, Products, Coal) : 

? Option Specific Views
? Spread Option Position (although not real-time updates)

Phase II Includes:

? User configured total columns/rows
? Counterparty filter
? Notional/Exposure calc toggle
? More meaningful labels for curves
? Geographical grouping of curve codes
? Predictive roll off
*with option to incorporate into current position
? Volumetric trading limits
? Roll risk

As an FYI -- We are in the process of developing a management level view of 
all EGM delivery expectations and plans for the next 12 months. This will be 
ready by the end of this month. We will also be developing a weekly report 
that will summarize status against planned milestones for Thunderball.  
Eventually this will be published for the other key projects that we will be 
starting for EGM.    

Let me know if you have questions or concerns.

Mary Nell and Peter,

I certainly agree.  I don't know if Jeff has called Mulva but that is the 
right action before we do anything else.  John will hear the result of that 
conversation as soon as it happens.

Thanks and good luck.

Who would have thought we would ever see the day that the J-Block contract 
was making so much money that the J-Block parties would intentionally default 
under it?  I guess we were just too good at our jobs...  My quick look at the 
amended contract tells me that our best contractual avenue is to analyze the 
possibility of wilful default under the contract, in which case the cap on 
damages would not apply.  Peter, as you and I discussed, the Bacton option 
may help our analysis on this.  I definitely would want to get outside 
counsel advice on the point, and in any event I agree that going to Mulva is 
the right approach to begin with.  Peter, let me know what you want me to do 
next, i.e., should we let the upper management contact run its course before 
I go for outside advice?  I expect so, but please let me know.  Ciao.

John,

Hello from South America.  I just got your email and I certainly concur with 
Jeff making the call.  He has maintained a good relationship with Mulva. This 
was a risk that we had but we did have assurances from Phillips regarding 
performance.  I don't know how much it will help however.  Richard Harper and 
Mary Nell Browning may have some ideas here but I am sure you've already gone 
through it with them.  I am amazed how the details get fuzzy on an old 
project.  When you discussed it, i was trying to think back to our remedies 
and discussions but the 3 years have made it difficult.

I don't know if there is anything I can do but I'm always willing to help.

Good luck,
Mike

Subject: J-Block


I mentioned on our conference call on Monday that J-Block has had problems 
meeting our nominations from the Judy/Joanne/Janice reservoirs.

Up until recent CATS maintenance shutdown on 15 May, they were making up for 
reduced production volumes by nominating to supply gas at the NBP which they 
are entitled but not obliged to do.  Since return from outage at the end of 
May they have declined to nominate at the NBP.  

>From 1 January to 15 May, the Sellers use of the NBP delivery option kept 
underdeliveries to 350 mmcf (ie one day's maximum quantity) in total.  Since 
returning from the maintenance shutdown, underdeliveries have totalled 850 
mmcf ( averaging 77mcf/d ).

We believe that following the sharp rise in market prices during the 
maintenance period, they have decided to default on the contract rather than 
make up deliveries from other sources.   They have an effective cap on the 
penalties of about 5 pence per therm (after taking into account the value of 
the liquids) and therefore they are not making up the volumes when the daily 
price is substantially higher than about 16 pence per therm.

Prior to the CATS shutdown, we had made them a proposal to enable them to 
deliver additional volumes at  another alternative to avoid default but they 
have not responded yet.

You mentioned that in your negotiations with Phillips they had committed to 
getting us all the gas regardless of the cap on the penalties.  This has cost 
us about $1.5 million to date and they seem to be institutionalising their 
non performance.    Perhaps a phone call by you might help.  

By the way I will be in Houston on Thursday and Friday to meet with the 
delegation from Croatia and I will probably be tied up the entire time but if 
you need me
for a phone call I can break away.

Mike-

As we discussed, the timing of the Gaza Transfer Agreement has once again 
become critical.  This e-mail will give you some background as to the 
situation.

We financially closed the $90MM loan for the Gaza project last June. There 
was a CP from the banks that the remaining $20MM of equity would not need to 
be in the Project company until a date in the future.  This was done because 
the project was placing a $20MM IPO locally and it was not possible to 
complete the IPO before the debt financing.  The IPO has been successfully 
subscribed; however, Enron has been blocking the transfer of the IPO funds 
into the project company as we must have certain minor share transfers 
completed prior to the transfer of the IPO funds in order to solidify our 
U.S. tax deferral structure.  

One of the covenants of the debt financing is that we must maintain a certain 
debt to equity ratio in order to be able to draw more debt.  The project has 
now reached the point in which it can no longer draw debt proceeds until the 
remaining $20MM of equity (the IPO funds) are transferred into the project 
account as these equity funds are required in order to allow for our 
debt/equity ratio to be preserved.  The timing of this issue is being driven 
by the fact that the project has to pay interest and commitment fees to the 
bank on the 3rd of January.  The only source of these payments are the IPO 
funds that must be transferred.

As mentioned above, Enron requires several minor share transfers in order to 
preserve the U.S. tax deferral structure (5 or 10 shares need to be exchanged 
in several companies in the chain).  These transfers must take place before 
the IPO funds are put into the Project Company.  The language of these minor 
transfers have been agreed among the partnership.  However, the partners are 
refusing to execute these minor transfers until Enron executes the Transfer 
Agreement.

When the Gaza project was being conceived, the former CALME management agreed 
to the Transfer Agreement and this agreement was memorialized in detail in 
the Joint Venture Agreement among the parties.  The Transfer Agreement 
provides no party may have a change in control of their ownership in the 
project without the consent of the other parties.  The JVA expressly states 
that this transfer restriction is to be entered into by Enron Corp. and that 
the restrictions on change of control apply all the way up the ownership 
chain to Enron Corp. as well as to the other partners ultimate parent 
entities.  

A draft of this Transfer Agreement has been previously reviewed by Mark 
Metts.  Mark indicated that he was not comfortable with the nature of the 
agreement; however, this was last summer when Enron was re-evaluating its 
position with respect to its international assets and it was thought that the 
Gaza project may have soon not been part of Enron.   

The Gaza team has spent a great deal of time over the past six months trying 
to either soften the nature of the Transfer Agreement or to make the 
restriction apply to some entity lower in the ownership chain than Enron 
Corp.  These efforts have been unsuccessful as the partners claim that the 
Transfer Agreement was a "pillar" of the deal that we had and furthermore 
that this deal had been agreed directly with very senior Enron personnel.

Therefore, it appears that we must deal with the Transfer Agreement now in 
order to allow Enron to preserve its tax deferral position, transfer the IPO 
funds and ultimately allow the project to meet its debt service obligations 
to the bank on January 3rd.  We have tried to bring this issue to a close 
sooner, but the parnters have delayed resolution until now.  The timing of 
this is unfortunate, but probably not accidental from our partners position.

You may reach me at any time at 502.458.4985 (through Thursday afternoon) or 
at 713.522.4802 (home) or 713.818.9019 (mobile) beginning Thursday evening.  
I appreciate your giving this attention during the holidays.

Mike:

Many thanks for all of the support in the placement of the former CALME 
employees.  We are done to just a very few at this time.

It appears that your new squad is getting some traction on building the LNG 
business.  I'm pleased to hear that.

I look forward to hearing how our transportation or logistics business is 
developing.  Perhaps we can get together sometime during the San Antonio 
conference to catch up.

All the best.  Shawn

PS.  the following is an interesting article about the online intermodal 
landscape.


Hashing Out E-commerce.

'Dot-coms' explain how they hope to compete in intermodal market and among 
themselves 

With some 150 websites devoted to transportation, e-commerce companies 
acknowledge that it's difficult for potential customers to cut through the 
confusion and figure out who's doing what and who's going to be with them for 
the long term. 

Because of the competition between their respective railroad partners, one of 
the bigger questions for intermodal shippers is the relationship between 
Arzoon and Freightwise. There has been speculation that after Freightwise was 
established by Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway, four competitors -- 
Union Pacific Railroad, Norfolk Southern, CSX and Canadian Pacific Railway -- 
teamed up with rival e-commerce site Arzoon in a response to BNSF's proposed 
merger with Canadian National Railway. However, both Freightwise and Arzoon 
claim that's not the case. "I'm continually asked, 'What's up with the four 
railroads and Arzoon?'" said Charley Eisele, UP senior vice president, 
strategic planning. "People are trying to make a whole lot out of the 
coincidence of these two things from a timing perspective. The reality is, it 
was a decision made on the underlying business model." 

Freightwise executives agree with that assessment, pointing out that because 
the industry happened to be divided along merger lines at the same time the 
railroads were aligning with e-commerce initiatives, it seemed too much of a 
coincidence that the same four railroads opposing the merger were the ones 
joining Arzoon. However, "I think to launch a company like this takes more 
than just a reaction to a merger," said Freightwise Chief Marketing Officer 
Sanjay Joshi. 

There are major differences between the two Internet companies starting with 
their business plans. Arzoon categorizes itself as a "shipper-centric 
transportation management system," whose target market is the roughly 80 
percent of the transportation business that currently moves under contract. 
Freightwise, on the other hand, classifies itself as a transportation 
exchange and is targeting the remaining 20 percent of the market procured on 
a spot basis. Arzoon, whose primary focus is the shipper, is setting out to 
help manage the relationships that already exist between shipper and carrier. 
The priority for carrier-focused Freightwise is to make sure the capacity is 
there for shippers who log on to their system. 

In addition, Arzoon, which currently is involved only with rail and truck, 
wants eventually to become a transportation management system that "manages 
across all modes and borders," including ocean and air freight, said Eisele. 
Freightwise will stick to truckload and inter-modal for the time being. 
"We're not sure about getting involved with air freight, given the size of 
the market and the economics," said Joshi. "It takes a different set of 
products and economics than surface transportation. Maybe sometime down the 
line, but right now we really plan on getting entrenched in the truckload and 
inter-modal spot market. We think that's a lot to chew. The key is to focus 
on a particular footprint that we can begin to own rather than get too broad 
and lose focus." 

The fact that Arzoon and Freightwise have teamed up with different rail 
carriers is another cause for concern. Will there be a disincentive on the 
part of carriers to use each others' e-commerce initiatives and ultimately, 
therefore, a disadvantage for prospective customers? 

"The answer is the 90-10 rule," said a source from an Arzoon rail partner. "A 
particular shipper is in a position where 90 percent of their business is 
conducted via truck and other modes, and maybe only 10 percent via railroads. 
If the choice presented to them is to select a system that addresses all 
modes effectively or one that only addresses a particular mode, then the 
90-10 rule would suggest that greater leverage would lie in picking the 
broader, multimode transportation management system. In that case, even 
though a railroad may have another (e-commerce) approach, it would clearly 
have to respond to the customers' needs in that situation." 

Freightwise's Joshi makes a similar argument. "Freightwise is merely another 
channel for BNSF to market its services," he said. "It posts a certain set of 
rates for what it believes to be fair for the service. It's not for 
Freightwise to decide what rates BNSF decides to move through its channel." 
UP may not decide to post its rates on Freightwise, Joshi said, "so then BNSF 
would have to find out what's the competitive rate relative to UP." 

Another question arises as to whether Arzoon may have a competitive advantage 
over Freightwise, particularly from an intermodal standpoint, because it is 
backed by both Eastern and Western carriers. whereas Freightwise is backed 
only by BNSF. "I would only say that the partnership we have with BNSF is not 
exclusive and that we're talking to other railroads as well," Joshi noted. He 
added, "This is an exchange to market your capacity and services. It would be 
very difficult for six railroads to do something on their own; there would be 
no critical mass. It's to the advantage of the other railroads to 
participate." 

Along with BNSF, which provides Freightwise with instant capacity, the 
company recently signed GE Corp. as an "anchor tenant" and equity investor 
that will help Freightwise reach the critical mass Joshi talks about. As both 
a major supplier to the rail industry (locomotives) and a potential shipper 
(appliances), "the goal is to use GE as something we can leverage, and work 
with their respective divisions as a way to reduce their transportation 
costs," he said. 

Visibility is a key advantage for potential customers of both Interment 
companies. "As a transportation management system with access to all modes, 
it allows shippers to be more efficient in the management of transportation," 
Eisele said. "Cross-modal visibility means that because they'll be managing 
their truck business under the same system as rail, the economics of rail 
will be much more visible. And we believe that with comparable reliability, 
the economics will be compelling to the point where rails will garner a 
greater share of those customers' total transportation buy." 

Joshi claims a big difference between Freightwise and other exchanges is that 
when a shipper is looking for transportation options between specific 
origin-destination pairs, Freightwise allows customers to make side-by-side 
comparisons between truck and intermodal. It is this price and service 
transparency, Joshi says, that will save its customers money: "We're giving 
customers three to five choices between truck and intermodal, not 50, so that 
they can see service and price parameters." 

Intermodal e-commerce ventures such as Freightwise also bring up the question 
of competition with traditional intermodal marketing companies. Joshi points 
out that its fee for doing a lot of what small and midsize IMCs do currently 
-- such as load matching, tracking and tracing and order processing -- is 3 
percent, which is split between the buyer and seller of the services. This 
compares to the 18 to 20 percent that customers traditionally have paid for 
retaining an IMC. "I don't think all brokers will embrace us," Joshi 
conceded, but at the same time, "there will be a segment of brokers who will 
begin migrating into higher-added-value services, for example, the 
third-party logistics side rather than the classical brokerage. They'll get 
into things like inventory management on behalf of shippers and leave 
back-end processing to firms like Freightwise." 

Webmodal, which is a purely intermodal e-commerce venture whose vision is to 
"make intermodal much more like truck in the eyes of the shipper," points out 
that it can take customers several days to receive a bid from a traditional 
IMC. "We can immediately configure door to door intermodal solutions that we 
can put together using our underlying carrier relationships," said Webmodal 
founder and CEO Chris Kravas. "We do business with a lot of large U.S. 
railroads and with 37 drayage companies. We give everybody access to all the 
information they might need to make decisions on price vs. service tradeoffs, 
and which carriers make most sense based on what the shipper is trying to do. 
And we do it without the traditional one-to-three-day wait that typically 
happens in response to a normal request for (intermodal services)." 

Kravas said the company has invested time and expertise in developing what it 
calls a "first-ever" schedule engine that works door to door. "Traditionally, 
the industry hasn't had a schedule engine that involves the 
'dray-plus-rail-plus-dray' services, so there's been pretty much a reliance 
on rules of thumb. But the truth is, it doesn't take anywhere near eight days 
for most origin-destination pairs. We have a very robust way of representing 
the capabilities of the dray carriers as well as the rail carriers, so that 
much more truck-like transit can be shown to be viable." 

Because of this, Webmodal sees itself as more of a technology and e-commerce 
company than a traditional IMC, and considers itself more a vendor than a 
competitor. How does a small or midsize IMC work as a customer of Webmodal? 
"Not all small IMCs are set up to do business with all of the railroads or 
with a large set of drayage companies," Kravas said. "What we do for them is 
give them a low-cost way to access, a comprehensive array of intermodal 
products and services available in the U.S. We've established ourselves as a 
business partner with a large base of first-rate drayage companies across the 
country. So if you're an IMC with an opportunity to handle freight in a new 
market, Webmodal allows you to put together a service and pay only a modest 
fee." Kravas wouldn't disclose the company's fee structure, only that it 
charges per shipment for a web-based order and a "slightly higher" fee for a 
phone or fax order. 

A smaller IMC also could use Webmodal to put in place a private version of 
its technology that would enable the IMC to better manage its business. "That 
would range from pricing, order fulfillment, customer service -- kind of the 
whole spectrum of capabilities that would allow an IMC to take advantage of 
our system," Kravas said. 

Everyone's waiting to see who's going to survive the transportation dot-com 
fallout. Before that happens, however, Freightwise may find itself as big a 
competitor with Arzoon as it is with a company like Webmodal. "We're starting 
from different points," said Freightwise's Joshi, "but down the line, yes, I 
can see" more head-to-head competition between the two companies. 

In addition to establishing itself in that 80 percent of the market devoted 
to transportation contracts, UP's Eisele notes that Arzoon also has a 
catalog-capability function, which eventually can be used to auction capacity 
in the spot market -- the market in which Freightwise is establishing itself. 
"We will very much have the capability to enable spot market buying," he 
said. 

As Webmodal's Kravas pointed out, "It's going to be an interesting next six 
months." 

Arzoon-A.T. Kearney partnership 

Consulting firm A.T. Kearney, a unit of Dallas-based EDS, and Arzoon, which 
provides Internet-based services for managing transportation work processes 
worldwide, have formed a strategic alliance. 

A.T. Kearney was one of the first to establish a dedicated practice helping 
shippers manage transportation more effectively on a global basis. Its 
clients now will have direct exposure to Arzoon's transportation management 
trading network, which provides online services for managing the full life 
cycle of work processes across all modes, systems and enterprises. 

Similarly, Arzoon and its clients can access "select" A.T. Kearney consulting 
services, the company said. That includes inbound transportation management, 
supply-chain and distribution rationalization, carrier selection and process 
improvement, Arzoon said.

"Superior transportation management has emerged as a critical success factor 
in the increasingly competitive world of commerce," said Randy Garber, 
transportation services co-leader of A.T. Kearney's operations services 
practice. "We think service companies, manufacturers and retailers that 
incorporate the speed, simplicity and efficiency of the Internet into their 
supply chains will lead their markets." 

The plan is for both A.T. Kearney and Arzoon to gain valuable understanding 
and insights into how the Internet creates great efficiencies in both the 
strategic and tactical needs of transportation professionals, Garber added. 

"We believe that the knowledge gained from this collaboration will benefit 
our clients as well as Arzoon's customers involved in the $1 trillion global 
freight transportation market," Garber said. 

An Arzoon official said the company was "very pleased" to be associated with 
A.T. Kearney, which Arzoon described as a "premier problem-so1ver." A.T. 
Kearney has a global presence that includes 62 offices in 37 countries. 
Arzoon.com, San Mateo, Calif., is a year-old Internet startup that describes 
itself as a company that is working on "the transformation of the worldwide 
transportation market into a networked community."

Doug,

The Masters was great and of course you were right, the course was 
magnificent.  This is my 4th trip down and I'm going to try and not ever miss 
the tournament (but of course I haven't played it!).  The azaleas were not at 
max bloom, i think they were about a week away due to the cooler weather.  
What a great tournament.

Please give me a call next time you are in Houston and I'll set up a game at 
Champions.  I am looking forward to the tour championship later this year. 

Give my best to Jennifer and Chris says hello.

Chris would like to email Jennifer, would you please send back your home 
email address via return email?  Ours is mmccontex@aol.com.

FYI.  Note that in spite of the positive report, the Dabho breakwater is 
still seriously behind schedule and, unless something changes radically, we 
will be entering the 2002 monsoon period with only about two-thirds of the 
breakwater complete.  DPC may not be able to take its 2002 volumes and will 
either face take-or-pay or (hopefully) force3 majuere relief if the 
breakwater delay can be attributed to construction force majeure.

This will be both a problem and an opportunity for us, because we may be able 
to get access to the DPC ship (if lenders permit it) and to cargoes to be 
remarketid on behalf of DPC.

Todd,

Thanks for the note. We are looking forward to seeing you when you visit
Muscat.

I was in Nagaski last week for the naming ceremony of Osaka Gas ship (LNG
Jamal. I managed also to see (from a distance) the Lakshmi under
construction. Quite impressive.

Please copy your messages to Mr. Sakaguchi (hiro.h.sakaguchi@olng.simis.com)
who is now looking after Sales section and will be in charge of ship shore
and implementation issues between OLNG and DPC. He is taking over from Toyo
Saito who is leaving us by end of the month.

Thanks


Harib Al Kitani

Thank you for your suggestion.  I was hoping that you could either forward 
this

get
in touch with him.  We are very interested in having someone represent Enron 
in

Thank you in advance.

Allison,

Thank you very much for the email and request.  As much as i an very proud
of our accomplishments while being responsible for Global Technology, I am
still of the opinion that Philippe Bibi is the best and most qualified
candidate from Enron.   Enron has changed its culture and business around
technology and EnronOnline alone changed the way our business operates.
EOL ended the year over with over $330 billion in transactions.  EOL was
only 1 part of our transformation however.

Thanks again and good luck with your award.

Mike and I have spent the last few weeks learning about each of your 
businesses, and we are convinced that EGM can be a tremendous driver in 
Enron's growth.  We have an opportunity to dedicate significant resources to 
each group, and grow them with tremendous focus.  To that end, I would like 
to maintain consistency and closely manage that growth as we begin this 
process.  Accordingly, please do not make any organizational changes, offer 
employment contracts, or hire/fire anyone until I approve.  Once we 
streamline our evaluative processes, and make any necessary organizational 
changes, Mike and I will take a more liberal approach to these activities.  

Thanks for your cooperation.  

Jeff

Hi Mike,

I just wanted to follow up with you after my meeting with Larry 
Lawyer.  Larry was positive about the product and business
opportunity I developed for the broadband space.  However, 
he also feels that the general business template I presented 
can be readily covered by his current team.  

I am still open to meeting with other members of your team, 
since some of your groups may like to have some people with 
structured finance and origination capabilities work a little 
more closely with them.  I'll follow your suggestion.  Thanks
again for your time.

Mathis.

Don,  

Howdy from Tokyo.  Thanks for the email.  It was great hearing from you.  I 
would be happy to talk with you in Dallas about your business.

In the mean time, why don't you send me a new email (without the personal 
stuff) about your company and references to your website and i will forward 
it to the appropriate people within Enron with a note to insure that it gets 
the proper attention.

Thanks and see you soon.
Mike

 Hey Mike, It's been a long time since we last spoke, hope all is
well with you and the family in Houston. I saw Jonny & Brenda in Telluride
this weekend and he mentioned we would be getting together in Dallas. It
will be great to see yall again.  It's already that time of year for the big
shoot-out when the Horns tangle with the Sooners. It looks like this could
be another very interesting game, no telling what will happen with the way
both teams are playing this year.

 I have been thinking of you and I had planned to call you to talk a
little business. Our company, Nexstar  is now up and running and working
with major corporations like Enron to provide mortgage loans to their
relocating employees and as a benefit to the general employment base. We are
a high tech , high touch approach to mortgage lending providing employees
with internet and/or telephony interaction with Nexstar. As a follow-up to
our discussion in the bar last year in Dallas, I thought we could chat about
what's going on in the financial services industry and if Nexstar's products
and services could be of any benefit to Enron. If you have any interest you
can view our website at nexstarhome.com.

Please drop me a note or give me a call so we can catch up and even talk a
little business. I also wanted to talk about that ballpark with your name on
it. I have not had a chance to see it yet but plan to when I get down to
Houston. Take care, and don't forget to HOOK-EM  Horns!

   Don

Monica,
This looks ok, but I can give you more accurate and more up to date slides 
for the future.  One important fact, we do not distibute the EOL slides to 
the general public.  Normally what we do is present the story but do not 
include hard copies with the conference hand outs.

John,

Attached for your review is a resume for Trevor Woods.  He worked for me in 2 
areas,  including directly for me in Technology.  He is outstanding and left 
enron to join his brother in law in a start up out in San Francisco.  He was 
an associate at the time.  He is interested in coming back and is talking 
with many areas of enron for positions.  His girlfriend, Julie Ferrara, is in 
Net Works and may becoming to London as an assignment.  If she does, he would 
really like to come as well - if it is possible.  I didn't know if you have a 
need but he is great and would make an excellent Jr. commercial guy in an 
origination type of role.  

I wanted you to have shot at him as well.

Mike

Doug, other than the worst greens of all time, i was very impressed with the 
course.  The layout of the front nine was outstanding.  10,11,13 were long 
and hard.  We shot 6 under and had a great time.  I bought a new odyssey 
putter and love it.

You guys did a nice job on the course.

I understand from Battaglia you played Memorial Park the other day. Other 
than the terrible greens, did you enjoy it?

Good point on extra space.  Please call Wes Colwell and discuss.  I think 
that makes 33 less of an option.

Mike,

I am totally open to wherever you think would be best.  If possible, it would 
also be good if there were a few extra
spots for some people in the group to be together.  I am not sure yet how 
many people will be needed but I would like
to optimally have a small swat team to focus on each business.  

Thanks very much for the kind words.  I look forward to focusing
on the new businesses quickly and figuring out ways to add value.  I am very 
excited to be working with you again.  Talk to you soon.

-Larry-

Jeff,

Attached is the outline from today's meeting.  

If I could put in my two cents about my future boss, I'd say:  hungry 
director... some good gas trader who's really sharp and excellent at what 
he's doing, but he's never going to be king of the gas desk because there's 
too many crown princes, and he'd rather side-step them all and push this LNG 
forward with a vengence.  and if he's tired of Houston and not too much of an 
arrogant bastard, that's a bonus.

I'm off to the pub.  These 7:30pm meetings don't do much for me.  Have a good 
weekend.

Merritt

Attached please find a first draft for your Executive Letter for the 
newsletter. I'm sorry that it is so sketchy. EGM is doing so much and I'm not 
sure what you want to focus on right now!  I am afraid if I keep going, I 
will be way over the word count for our space allotment. Right now, there are 
404 words. Please fill in where it is pertinent and monitor word count to 550.

Again, I'm sorry to impose on you with this.

Attached, for your information, is  a copy of a general presentation that I 
prepared to illustrate and describe EGM's businesses.  This is a presentation 
that will become a "living" document to communicate our businesses and 
growth.  I will be making numerous changes as we move closer to the analyst 
meeting in January but I wanted to give everyone a copy of this version.

Please don't hesitate to call me if you have any questions or comments.

Dear Mr. McConnell:

Your organization's fees for 2000-2001 ISRC membership have not been paid. A

Would you kindly look into it and help us to get this settled?

We appreciate your support of the ISRC.

Sincerely,

Eric,

Hoping all is well,

Wanted to have a quick chat with you, when you are next in Houston, about the 
Egypt LNG opportunity.  I had a meeting with the minister and the deputy 
minister for technical affairs and both were intereseted in increased 
participation in the LNG field in Egypt.  They are interested in diverse 
off-takers, and are interested in investing in new facilities (EGPC would 
like to own 60% of such a new facility and local/Arab investors can be found 
for the remaining equity).  They know they don't know how to project finance 
such deals, and they know they need a strong international name as an (at 
least partial) off-take.  They alluded that the situation with Finosa, 
although progressing, is not as it appears in the press.

At any case, I believe we have enough elements to warrant a 
conversations--and I have good contacts in Egypt that could help push such a 
project forward.

Cheers'

Hamd

Subject: Re: eCommerce Commercial & Origination List  

Mike,
In addition to our e-commerce activity (energy.enron.com), my team has a 
number of "e-business" initiatives either under development or 
consideration.  These initiatives relate to using internet technologies to 
improve customer satisfaction, improve productivity, shorten the sales cycle, 
etc, not directly to transacting per se.  For example, we are creating a 
customer portal that will allow our existing customers to get access to a 
variety of information--such as billing, energy usage, project status, 
general news, etc.--all through a single browser view that can be customized 
to present only the information that the customer's interested in.  Another 
application we're exploring would use internet technology to streamline the 
deal process through on-line collaboration with our prospective customers.  
Although these wouldn't be considered traditional e-commerce initiatives, 
they're examples of using the internet to create more value through better 
execution in our business.  

Do you want to start tracking these kinds of initiatives too?  There may be 
opportunities in other BU's to use similar applications or otherwise take 
advantage of our learning.

Mike

Thanks for the email.  Reorganize and grow this business?  Not me??!  Upon 
first look, this business appears to have huge opportunities and ones that 
can be executed upon, especially if they consider themselves a core 
business.  It will  be a big challenge but we will make it work in a big 
way.  A lot of people have tried to make this business work.

I'll follow-up on Treasury Connect, thanks for the heads up.

By the way, science is Gary's passion and he has an undergraduate and MS in 
chemistry.  He might be an interesting guy to get involved (at least at the 
edges) with this project.  I told him about it and he really would like to 
get invited to the next meeting.  What do you think?  It always helps to have 
an avid supporter in a new business.

Mike

Congrats!  Those guys better watch out, you might organize them.

FYI, we have an investment in a company called Treasury Connect that has an 
interest rate swap portal.  Gary is working with them to do a trade.  They 
are currently negotiating with the World Bank to provide a private label 
product to them.

TC's clients include Xerox, GE, Duke and us.  I know with the webification of 
everything that we will be looking at those markets, but I would like to make 
sure our guys evaluate their technology offering before you move to far into 
their market.  They are focused on the very low value, commoditized 
transactions, so I don't know if it is an area Enron will compete for.

Thanks,
Mark

Please see below the draft of our "potential" intervention into the current 
application process at FERC re. Elba Island.  

We have been working with Shelley Corman to assure that we won't be stepping 
on any toes.  Shelley feels our draft is fine aside from some minor language 
changes.  She also committed to run it by Stan Horton this morning and we 
will address any concerns he has if necessary.

We also plan to forward/discuss with the El Paso FERC people prior to 
submission.

Please call if you wish to discuss.

Also if you have received a similar note from me earlier this morning, I 
apologize.  I am sending this for the second time as I am concerned that my 
E-mail was not functioning properly this morning.

Thanks

Rick,

As Mike probably also mentioned we have the attention at the top of NIC.  
Both Frevert and McConnell got a good taste of their commitment during a 5+ 
hour meeting two weeks ago.  I will be in Houston this coming week to speak 
with the different product heads about Project Sato (NIC) and help establish 
some priorities with them.  We should try to establish some time to speak.

Coordination on this becomes critical to show results as quickly as 
possible.  I plan on speaking with Eric and Jonathan next week as well.

discussions, in followup to the meetings that he and Mark Frevert had.

Clay and I are planning to be in korea for meetings on 4/5June.  We are then 
planing to come to Tokyo to see you and ePower on 6/7 June

FYI, both Clay and I have known Nissho Iwai for many,many years and, in fact, 
many of the LNG contracts that Nissho is involved with are contracts that 
Clay and/or I either helped put together or administered.

Will you be in Tokyo on 6/7 June?

Subject: Global LNG's Contacts with Japanese Trading Companies, Nissho Iwai 
in Particular

Joe:

Following up on my phone conversation with Morten Erik today and in advance 
of your meetings in Houston next week, I would like to brief you about Enron 
Global LNG's recent contacts with Japanese trading companies.

We have tabled master spot LNG SPAs, in both FOB and ex-ship form, with 
Mitsubishi, Nissho Iwai, Itochu and Mitsui with the objective to discuss, 
negotiate and conclude these contractual arrangements by late fall this year.

Nissho Iwai represents a special case, though.  In addition to our 
discussions on the master spot LNG purchase contracts, we had previously 
talked with NIC about possible access to some of the LNG shipping capacity 
they control.  Also, during my meeting with Nissho Iwai earlier this week, 
they showed keen interest in connecting with Enron Global LNG's team 
developing the U.S. West Coast terminal opportunities.  NIC, with some other 
Japanese partners, has apparently been trying to develop a specific site in 
California (offshore concept) for some time and is now looking for a 
suitable, strong U.S. partner.  There will be an exploratory meeting held on 
this issue in Houston between Kurt Lindahl and NIC representatives (both from 
Tokyo and New York) probably in early June.

Please let me know if you need more information on this subject.

Regards,

Zdenek Gerych

but are taking care to fully vet all possible issues with local council. If 
we end up with any risk in the transactions, we'll come back to you. 
Otherwise we're plowing ahead and currently hope to sign docs before

Subject: Celanese due diligence

Per,

As we discussed on the phone last night, the results of our due diligence 
this week indicate that the Celanese deal can be executed as a back-to-back 
transaction.  A summary of our due diilgence findings is below.  I'll update 
you after our discussions with Celanese this afternoon.

Brad


KWELM Management Services (KMS), the purchaser, has agreed in our presence to 
a to back-to-back execution, and to attempt to achieve back-to-back funding.  
If the latter cannot be achieved, we would bear KMS credit risk for 30-60 
days; I am confident that we can get our credit people comfortable with the 
risk, and that is is a prudent exposure.   
To be clear, there will not actually be back-to-back purchase and sale 
agreements, but rather an assignment from Celanese to ENE, and a commutation 
/ extinguishment of the rights obtained from that assignment by ENE in 
exchange for consideration from KWELM.  Documentation risk between the two 
contracts will be eliminated by annexing the form of assignment to the 
commutation contract.

KMS's conditions precedent are all reasonable, and we will be requiring the 
same conditions precedent in the documentation that we obtain from 
Celanese.    
If Celanese does not agree these, we do not execute.

We do not assume any existing or potential insurance liabilities by means of 
the purchase from Celanese because we are only having assigned to us the 
right to receive payment on the claims, and not the underlying obligations or 
the liabiilty that was the basis of the claim.  
This conclusion is supported both by the assignment document language, and by 
English law, which allows the assignment of rights, but not obligations.

reiterate, the key commercial risk issues are:

1)  Tax--Jordan Mintz has a high degree of confidence regarding the 
qualifications of the Pacificorp machines.  Thorough due dilligence will be 
required to investigate the representations made in the private letter ruling 
applications.

2)  Syndication--Joe Deffner and Tim Proffitt are working to find 
monetizers.  Ideally, the monetizers would close when we do.  Realistically, 
we have to assume that we will bridge the deal and wear equity risk until we 
can shed our ownership.  Pacificorp has expressed an interest in staying in 
as 25% owner, which should reduce the bridge risk, since we can show the 
former owner staying in the game.

3)  Operations--The risk of operations will lie with the holders of the 
equity.  Post-syndication, the new owners can contract directly with an 
operator.  For tax purposes the owner needs to have some risk.  We will guide 
the monetizers to this risk.  If we have to indemnify them in this area, we 
will need to better understand the available insurance products.
4)  Marketing--This is the risk the coal desk is trying to acquire.  The desk 
believes that the coal/synfuel spread risk will decrease dramatically over 
the next 12-18 months.  We have put $6.00/ton into the model, and the desk 
will buy $3.00/ton today for seven years.  The current market is anywhere 
from $1.00-3.00/ton.  We have also developed a list of strong sites that are 
looking for machines, three of which we control, either through options or 
marketing agreements.

The economics of the deal are compelling.  We put out $100mm to Pacificorp as 
an equity bridge (maybe less if they stay in as 25% owner).  We collect 
$30-50mm in commodity spread origination, and another $30-50mm in equity 
origination.

Commercially, the deal makes sense, and I am confident that we can structure 
around the risks.  The decision we need from senior management is whether 
this is a game we want to play.  The machines fit into the letter of the 
law.  Big companies (AIG, Florida Progress, Detroit Edison, etc.) have joined 
in the reindeer games.  We can put on the position we want by bridging this 
deal.

On the flip side, people have heartburn over "spirit of the law" issues and 
those are questions that senior management has to decide.   We have a chance 
to move on these machines, but need to make up our mind by the end of this 
week whether to put resources on it.  We can back out later (our commitment 
so far is non-binding), but we can't get back in.

Please let me know your thoughts.

Regards,

Dan

All,

Attached is a presentation that I have put together to review EGM's 
activities.  The purpose is to provide an information package on our 
businesses for Senior mgt and Investor relations.  This will not be 
distributed externally but will education people on our businesses and some 
of our goals.

Please take a few minutes to briefly  review and make any comments and/or 
changes and fax  or provide a hard copy back to me.  You can send me copies 
of just the pages that have updates.  Also please focus on the map and insure 
that there are not mistakes ( i found some recently).  There is also a 
shorter version presentation that is more external and once I've updated 
both, i will send everyone a copy via email for your reference and use.

Thanks,
mike

Mike,

I agree with your assessment on keeping tabs on them but currently I don't 
see any real opportunity or decision to spend time or money with this 
effort.  I have received feedback from others in the group as well and they 
agree with our general thinking.  Have you talked with Louise lately?  We are 
announcing today that we will be pushing our pricing to other platforms in 
the US (therefore we keep all the liquidity of their markets).  Maybe this 
will apply to these guys, someday.  Certainly it is not appropriate now and 
with your domination concerns it might scare them even more.

My time is very limited next week and I am double booked most of the time.   
I'm out Wed - Sunday and then the analyst meetings begin after that.  I 
really don't have time to meet with them especially if there is not real deal 
pending.  Is there someone else that is more appropriate, maybe someone can 
take them through EOL?  If you like that, please call Louise and co-ordinate.

Thanks,
Mike

I tend to agree with your initial comments. At this point I do not see a 
clear opportunity from a value standpoint but I do need to assist these guys 
and keep tabs on their development.

To me it looks more like a Streamline or Quick Trade product that is at the 
drawing board stage.  They are going to Oklahoma on Friday. William's may be 
the best group for them to ultimately hook up with. 

It is possible that the only thing we can offer this group latter on is a 
link to EOL if we so choose that to be advantageous. This market is too small 
and there is growing concern that EOL is a looming beast that will dominate 
market share. For now I need to continue to foster these projects until one 
is successful or EOL is no longer a political concern.

 Could you be available for a presentation Monday or Tuesday. I will 
participate via conference call. 

Your assistance is greatly appreciated.

Mike,
I just had my schedule changed dramatically for tomorrow and will not be able

Sorry, but we have a situation I must get involved with and change a 
direction.

I did review the email, and passed it on to others.  I do not see much from 
this site nor how it is actually going to develop real liquidity in the 
market.  If there are a couple of items that you want me to specifically be 
ready for , please send me a couple of comments via email or voicemail.

Subject: resume - Antonio Jenkins-lara

Mike:

One of the things I wanted to discuss in our meeting was your advice on one 
of the CALME personnel for deployment, Antonio Jenkins Lara.

He is a very solid candidate that I'm confident can add great value in Enron.

Antonio has been a strong performer for us in his short stay with us.  He 
joined us around the middle of the year, so we did not have much data when we 
conducted our mid-year review.

He is an entrepreneur with strengths in logistics and systems.  He has both 
technical and commercial backgrounds.

During this year, he used is background in logistics and management to 
identify $1.8MM in recurring annual savings for Ventane, one of Enron's 
businesses in Venezuela.

I had initially placed him with Dan Reck because of Antonio's background in 
logistics.  However, it appears that Dan is more interested in bringing on 
people with a background in trading, which is not Antonio's strength.

I encourage you to closely examine his resume and I appreciate any good ideas.

I'm also looking forward to getting together with you soon.

Many thanks.  Shawn

Subject: EnronOnline in Argentina

Patrick,

I am pleased to hear that Argentina wants to be live with EnronOnline 
September 1. We will support your effort to make it a success. However, I 
have a few concerns:

Whatever the local differences, the commercial effort will be very similar to 
that in Brazil. Therefore, I recommend you involve the relevant commercial 
people there, so we can replicate experiences and lessons learned. I agree 
and  I have proposed whoever the applicable Sao Paulo resources are that will 
have responsibility for EOL should be part of the process either via our 
weekly conference calls or physically present in Argentina during strategic 
periods of implementation. The relevant Sao Paulo functions should decide how 
important this is to them and allocate time and resources accordingly.
Can you please specify your resource requirements for IT support for both 
implementation and operation. I do not believe we are adequately staffed and 
we can not afford to have any S?o Paulo IT resources sucked into this without 
proper planning. We have always tried not to suck on Sao Paulo unless 
absolutely necessary. We will continue to operate in this manner. We have 
kept the appropriate people aware of our status and situation on a weekly 
basis and I believe we have all the necessary resources up and running now. I 
will have a better feel after my meetings this week.
The bandwidth installed from BA to Houston is not sufficient to support the 
operation of front and back office. Lead time for upgrades is 90 days. We 
have been aware of this need for a period of time. We will need a solution to 
the time schedule you are proposing. Please assist in this effort and let me 
know what our options are.

In the future, I will appreciate to be informed and consulted on any 
activities in our region involving Enron Net Works.
You have been involved in our meetings over the past few months although 
Patrick has indicated we missed you in the scheduling  of the latest 
implementation meeting . We will cc everyone to avoid not fully communicating 
in the future. I will also forward the full implementation schedule and 
assignments to the above cc list.

If you have any additional concerns please contact me directly.

MFG


Thanks, Steve

Subject: Contents for todays meeting

Here are the documents that Patrick sent to us for the meeting. The following 
is a summary of the meeting.

Argentina wants to be live on Sept 1.
They want to be in a simulation mode for the last two weeks of August. There 
is concern on Scott's part about the ability to do this. He indicated that 
the test environments cannot provide a complete simulation flow.
One driver for the timing appears to be the board meeting scheduled for 
Buenos Aires on October 11. They want to be in the air by then. Maybe even 
time a market splash for then.
They are concerned about the bandwidth and the time to get it upgraded. 
Michael wants it upgraded by August 15. This is close to impossible unless 
Houston manages to pull major strings with the vendors. Interestingly,  BA is 
averaging 40% utilization these days (post PEP). Internet wil be off the link 
probably the first or second week on August. If necessary we can cut back the 
number of tie lines as a stop gap measure. 
Argentina is planning on having Sitara available by August 31 so they can use 
it to replace CPR. The support staff does not think this will be any problems 
at all. They have already started the work and they indicated to me that 
there is little else to do. 
Mario Cardoso has left Enron. He was replaced by Leonardo Pacheco. I will try 
to meet him while in Houston.
The issue of how to train is still open. Options are to send someone from 
Houston to BA to train. Or send someone from BA to Houston,. They are not yet 
going up on Enpower and the P&L is done in Houston so the support staff in 
Houston thinks that the best thing would be to send Veronica  to Houston. She 
is the one who currently works on CPR and will work with Sitara. From what I 
have seen,  it is possible that Carolina would also benefit from this.  I 
will bring this point up to Patrick and suggest that he talk this over with 
support staff and Scott Mills and see if they are comfortable. Patrick, what 
do you think.
I will check into the password control process in Houston (EOL client 
passwords) so I can report on how it is done. Then we can check our process 
for Argentina. 
Patrick has also asked me to look into the Help Desk procedures for the apps 
support (for example Sitara), and the end client help desk. I will be finding 
out about this tomorrow. 
Apparently there are print problems with CPR. Ariel, can you look into this 
with Veronica and call Martha Stevens to help get this resolved. 
Martha Stevens will gather some materials she has about the apps flows and 
get them to me. They walked my through the basic processes (very nutshell 
version). 

Please let me know if you have any questions.  

Thanks,

Julie

Cheryl,

Thanks for the update.  I like the progress.

I realize that we can not cover us 100% for the future contract but at least 
it will help.  What I think we need is some way to protect us incase he gives 
us a very high bid price to build the house  because we are captive.  What do 
you suggest as a possible remedy?  Some sort of checks on allowing others to 
bid?   Some sort of out on re-purchasing the lot at a set price?  Without a 
cost plus methodology we could be very vulnerable here.  What do you think?

A few of the other issues you addressed in the earlier fax.

2. Earnest money:  I like putting it in title company vs. Flair.  
3. Title policy:  Lets go ahead and take the additional coverage, I think it 
is prudent especially with the new subdivision. How much does an additional 
15% cost?  I don't have any idea.
4.  have provided
5.  not sure i understand this
6.  yes, delete 
7. definitely change and check b1 and hire an inspector
8. add in clarifying statement
9. agree to add builder obligation.  I am fine with a quick closing date and 
needs specificity.  Does he have an estimated time of completion?
10. Rollback taxes:  I agree, clarify as to the exemption, we need to be 
protected here.
11. add this to contract.  Flare may want the money but we should try it.

I hope this helps.  After you review and discuss these issues, let's get 
together via phone and discuss outstanding issues.  Please call Cathy 
Phillips with a time to talk.  She can be reached at 713 853-6898

Thanks,
m

Subject: Unimproved Property Contract

Dear Mike:

On Friday, February 23, 2001 we received by fax a copy of the Residential
Construction Contract Mr. Kent intends on using in connection with the
construction of your home.  Upon receipt we noticed that it was not a Cost
Plus Contract.  Therefore, we spoke with him about this matter.  He
indicated that although he believes he will be doing the home on a cost plus
basis, no final agreement regarding this matter had yet been made.

The Residential Construction Contract form he uses is a Greater Houston
Builders Association form which is, for the most part, a good one although
it is written primarily to protect the builder.  Therefore, we may ask that
a number of minor changes be made to the Contract as it relates to notice
requirements to you regarding problems in construction and some changes in
the indemnity language.  In addition, there may be some other changes we
request.  Under any circumstance, we can dictate a letter to Mr. Kent at the
appropriate time.

Mr. Kent also indicated that he will make sure we receive a copy of the Deed
Restrictions as soon as possible.

We assume that you will acquire financing for the construction of the home
itself.  When you close, Flair Construction Co., Inc. will also have to
provide to you a Disclosure Statement which spells out some of your rights
and responsibilities under Texas law and a Contractors List of
Subcontractors and Suppliers which tells you the names and addresses of the
Subcontractors Flair intends on using.  We are sure that the construction
lender will require that these documents be provided at the appropriate
time.

Should you have any questions or comments, please call us.

Joe,
I think the entire event was outstanding.  I also enjoyed it but my hand 
still hurts!  Ken went through it today at the executive committee and he 
talked about the incredible potential and the job you were doing.
Congratulations again,

Mike,

Certainly appreciate you visiting the office and helping with the opening... 
not the least shaking over 300 hands and breaking the barrell.  Sorry we were 
not able to spend some time discussing business.  We did get some good time 
with Jeff on Wednesday.  I understand we will now be on a weekly call.

Ken seemed to be satisfied with the opening.  His visit has done quite a lot 
for us.

thanks,
Joe

FYI---attached is a copy of the slides I used for my recent speech in Saudi.  
Speech was well received by those pushing for privatization in Saudi (Crown 
Prince's office, Gas Initiative committee, etc) but met with resistance frome 
the entrenched monopolists (ARAMCO, Saudi Electric, Saudi Water etc.)  
Similar dynamics as japan.

Had a very good meeting with the Head of ARAMCO---Harvard educated, very 
competent executive but with some real constraints being imposed on him.  I 
will see him again soon now that I know him---there may be some cool 
service-related opportuniites for us within ARAMCO that could be big.  It 
won't cost us much in time or money to find out.

Gentlemen,

Below is a draft org announcement I would like to send out to the HR team 
today or towmorrow, essentially clarifying responsibilities following the 
formation of EGM and EIM. I do not intend to circulate outside HR other than 
to then 7 of you, Cindy O and the other HR leads. This essentially reflects 
what I hope you already know that your HR lead support is:

ENA - Me with Sheila Knudsen (I ultimately hope Cindy Skinner will move to 
take this lead sometime next year).
EGM - Cindy Skinner and Shanna Funkhouser (We believe Shanna will develop to 
lead this in the next 12 months)
EIM - Me and Fran Mayes (the plan would be for Fran to eventually take lead 
on this when she is ready).


Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

David

Western Hemisphere Wholesale Energy HR Group Organisation Change

When we launched our HR Franchise Team structure in February this year we did 
so with the commitment to continually refine and challenge ourselves to 
ensure we were optimising the resources we have available to help our 
businesses achieve and exceed their goals. In fact you will recall in 
communicating the changes in February, we actually highlighted what we 
anticipated would be a need to make further refinements and changes to 
maximise our effectiveness.

A great deal has happened in these last 6 months and I am delighted that the 
Franchise team concept has contributed so much towards our far greater 
partnership with our individual business groups and our own outlook, 
priorities and objectives. We truly have revolutionised how we provide HR 
services and advice. More importantly, the business has recognised us for the 
huge progress we have made to date. This success is an outstanding 
achievement and one that I hope you join me in being extremely proud of.

As is always the case at Enron, continuous change is the norm and so as to 
illustrate this point quite effectively the businesses previously part of ENA 
have over the last 2 months, essentially been split into three: Enron Global 
Markets, set up to focus on the Global Fuels markets which were previously 
part of Enron Europe and CALME,  Coal, Financial Tarding and 
Insurance/Weather which were all previously part of ENA. EGM is now led by 
Mike McConnell and Jeff Shankman. Enron Industrial Markets, set up to focus 
on the Industrial markets and expand our activities across new Industrial 
sectors which will build on the success of the Paper, Pulp and Lumber 
business previously part of ENA and immediately develop a steel market. EIM 
is led by Jeff McMahon and Ray Bowen. Enron North America remains the largest 
of these three businesses even after these changes and will now focus all of 
its efforts on the highly successful Gas and Power markets in North America, 
including Canada and Mexico. ENA continues to be led by Dave Delainey and 
John Lavorato. Mark Frevert, following his return from Europe, has been 
instrumental in the restructuring of these businesses and is Chairman of each 
of these as well as Enron Europe, which collectively now constitute Enron's 
entire activities in the Wholesale commodity markets.

These changes in the businesses we support clearly force us to re-examine the 
HR business model and adjust our strategy accordingly. Fortunately, our 
flexible organisation structure lends itself extremely well to realign along 
these new business lines and as such the changes illustrated below in the 
attached org chart are far easier for us to make than they might otherwise 
have been. In addition, given the immense value and positive client feedback 
we have received on our efforts to concentrate our HR resources on Franchise 
skill lines, this also provides us with an opportunity to reinforce and 
refine our efforts in developing market intelligence, employment 
propositions, compensation ideas and best practices, as well as the 
innovatively sourced talent pipelines in each of these areas to pro-actively 
provide our clients with a competitive advantage.

I believe the changes outlined on the attached org chart are self 
explanatory, however if you have any questions please feel free to raise them 
either with your team leads or me. Given that we have a staff meeting 
scheduled for Friday I would plan to walk through these changes with you and 
answer any questions at that time.

Finally, to reinforce our goals and prepare you all for the next 6 months, I 
would like to underline the overall commitment to continue to change and flex 
our resources to anticipate, meet and exceed our businesses needs. This will 
clearly mean further organisation changes as we move forward. This is not 
Change for change's sake, but change, and our ability to change quickly and 
as often as necessary, is essential for us to remain a competitive and 
effective HR resource for our clients.

First, thanks for jumping in on this.  I am confident we can get it done even 
though it will be a fire drill.

We had a control or process matrix meeting today and it is all there, it was 
just being held or managed in four places.  It will all  be pulled together 
by Monday in one place (one complete document) and will have about 15 major 
categories with specific tasks under each category with status, person 
responsible, comments and date to be completed.  It will also have a complete 
timeline. We can review that Monday and agree on its content.  Louise agreed 
to review it as well.

As it relates to the people you mentioned, let me know how and/or who you 
want to pull in after we agree on the control document.  That way we will 
know which areas I have holes and how we can fill them.

Salley Beck called (she mentioned you had called her as well) and we agreed 
that the ClickPaper's back office representative would officially be Scott 
Earnest (he has been unofficially it for months and we have been working with 
him for months).  She is going to get in place people to be our Product 
Control Group for CP launch on July 24th.  Scott and Salley will work to 
source it so that we have 3 or 4 people trained and ready on the 24th to 
receive password applications, create customer profiles on ClickPaper and 
start the applications through credit, legal and tax and finally get out user 
IDs to clients.  We will leverage off the EOL process but not use their 
people unless there is some emergency.  Remember, we are only setting up 
people for paper so the process is somewhat simplified.

We also have a help desk person starting next week.  I don't have his name 
yet, but we have him and one more on the way.  We will create for them a 
brief manual and train them on the system as fast as we can.

I did have a good meeting with Louise and Dave.  We walked inch by inch 
through getting a user ID and password to getting a trade done.  We have a 
few holes, but it is not that far away.  She is going to think about a 
process document for this and get back to me Monday.  I have a detailed EOL 
one and we will give it our shot this weekend.

Let me know what Mark Palmer says.  He knows we have been using Margaret.  We 
will sit down with Margaret again on Monday and detail for her the PR plan 
and what she needs to do.  We still plan to go out with a fairly inclusive 
mailing ( a letter) that does not include temporary IDs/passwords.  We will 
tell them that the launch is coming and as special customers, we want to use 
this time to get them pre-registered.  Besides, there is no way to test a 
1000 temporary IDs anyway.  We will send those out later.  as I said earlier, 
the goal is to replace the splash screen with the unsecure area (or garden as 
Lousie would call it) by next for Friday or the following Monday. That way 
people can surf the content and get registered.

On legal, I have been using Travis McCullough for at least four months and we 
had a detailed discussion today about the contracts, what is needed and the 
deadline. There is legal work left to do ( the current draft of the password 
application doesn't work), but if Taylor can help, that would be great.  We 
will get our commercial comments back to Travis by Monday.

I have a meeting Monday with Bill Bradford and Ted Murphy (with Bob Crane and 
Hal as well) to discuss the issue of a manual interface and the control 
issues associated with it.  Credit is fine, we have been working with 
Bradford for months, but Murphy needs to understand the issues with manual 
posting. I will also make sure they check with Rick Buy on his approval and 
views.

The entire ENA Paper group has the link to our site and we will have all 
their comments by the end of next week. They will also be given the complete 
Net Works and ClickPaper story on Thursday at their offsite and are ready to 
help the roll out.  We also have them scheduled to come in Saturday, July 
22nd for the final testing of the system.

Remember, the 24th is a one (Enron)-to-many launch with a financial market 
only.  ClickPaper is not the counterparty in the trade section, Enron is so 
it is simply a new distribution channel for Enron's existing financial 
offering.  Later, we will build it out for physical (probably sooner rather 
than later).  Finally, I will incorporate the EOL link or transaction loop 
but Louise said today that is October or November.  It will only be 
many-to-many if someone comes in and makes a compelling case ($$$) to do so.

Thanks.

See you tomorrow.

Greg,  a couple of other thoughts and ideas for Monday's meeting.

I would like to discuss the entire process chain as part of the timelines, 
personnel responsibilities and key action items.  I think this is another 
good way to find any potential gaps and help prioritize various items and 
assignments.
Andrew Parsons Sr. Director (and superior performer) is a great and very 
smart guy that can add a lot of value to the effort.  You will like him and 
he will be a very valuable resource to add to the team - even if it is for a 
couple of weeks.  He wrote the IT compliance process chain and could reverse 
engineer difficult parts that are unique to the Ariba platform.  He has 
others on his team that could help and I've asked him to think about his 
existing AA resources that are available (some are working on ClickPaper 
already).
Other resources that have been identified to potential added firepower in the 
short run:  Beth Pearlman, John Tollefson (IT), Bob Schultz (LK said she 
could spare him without delaying phase 2 roll out), Dave Forester (not a good 
option because it would definitely set back phase 2 roll out), Mary 
Solmenson, Scott Mills, Berry Pearce, David Port, David Sweeny, Sally Beck 
(advice and discuss additional resources).
I did ask Louise to jump in (and i know you did too) to help on some quick 
thoughts on process and lessons learned.
I saw the process maps for EOL and I think they, or the simplified early 
versions, are very important and key to a successful launch for ClickPaper.
I went by to see Mark Palmer (he was out) and left him a voice mail on the 
marketing effort and what Margarat Allen is doing.  I wanted him to make sure 
that he understood the importance and priority of this effort.
I also talked with Beth Pearlman about helping out (or assigning John 
Tollefson) and I told her that we would be talking about this on Monday 
afternoon.
Do we need to have Alan Aronowitz or Mark Taylor look over the agreements to 
add a trading perspective?

A few thoughts,  see you tomorrow.

Mr. McConnell,

I am an Energy Management major at OU who is interning here at Enron.  My 
work experience so far has been excellent, and nothing less than what I had 
hoped for.  I have had the opportunity to hear you speak a few times in 
Norman and have been very impressed.  I have been impressed by the things you 
said about this company and its ideals, programs and its commitment to 
excellence - all of which I have seen since I started work.  The most 
impressive thing to me, however, were the things you said about positive 
thinking, goal setting, and the power of the subconscious mind in your talk 
with the J.C. Penney Leadership Program.  These are beliefs which I have been 
raised on by my father, and really believe to be true.  It was very 
inspirational to hear that type of message from someone else for whom it has 
obviously worked.  As I have started my internship here, I am implementing 
this psychology into my life and work ethic, and thought you would might have 
some helpful advice.  I know you are an extremely busy man, but I decided to 
send you an email and ask if you ever had a few free minutes in which I could 
speak with you about how this way of thinking has positively impacted your 
career.  If you ever have a few minutes of free time this summer, I would 
really appreciate the opportunity to speak with you.

Thank you for your time

Blake Lasuzzo

Our ability in crude is apparently very poor.  What can J Wilson do thru 
2010?  I want the crude desk to make us a price and present an acceptable 
volume.  

If we have to suggest to PDVSA only doing a crude index through 2012, I 
strongly believe we should try if we can create some additional value thru 
this structure.  Tell me if you would like me to give him a call to explain 
what the effort potentially create.

Subject: Re: Jose LNG - Crude Pricing  

 Per a conversation I had with John Wilson the head crude oil trader in the 
Houston office, the feasability of hedging price risk linked to WTI or Brent 
on a 20 year deal is NOT a possibility.  If we had 1/3 of our GSA price 
linked to Brent our exposure for 20 years would be about 30 million barrels 
notional or about 14 million barrels PV.  At 5% our exposure would still be 5 
million notional or 2.3 million PV.  According to John, he would not be 
comfortable doing anything past 2012 and even out that far he would not 
consider doing more than about 1 million PV barrels in the years 2010 - 
2012.  Given these comments, I would say that the size of our deal basically 
precludes a look at Crude Oil hedges at this time.  As far as the economics 
of the deal are concerned, we basically cannot even get an Offer to use to 
figure out our economics.  I am confident that if we pushed the issue to see 
if we could get a 20 year offer even for a small portion of the volumes that 
the hedging costs would be too high, and therefore have left it at that for 
the time being.   Please advise if you have any thoughts on the issue.

Thanks,

Eric

Eric, thanks for your comments. Please see below in blue our observations and 
answers. Let's talk later today if you have further questions.

Saludos

Guido and Emilio 


Enron Offtake Agreement

Section 2
Should this agreement start at commercial hand over of the plant under the 
EPC agreement.  Benefit here is LDs under the EPC for late delivery go to 
project company and project company has no obligation to lng buyers.  In 
addition it preserves your 20 year offtake which should still match your GSA.

 The agreement should start at commercial hand over of the plant as you say. 
The draft as it is now has only outer limits as to when that should happen 
(that being the earlier of 40 months after Financial  Close or NTP or Dec 31 
2004). We will add to this list "the earlier of" something like: "the date on 
which the plant has produced LNG at at least 90% of its capacity for a period 
of 10 consecutive days". We suggest putting something like this as opposed to 
"commercial hand over" because this is in the plant's/contractor's control 
and they could, for example, on purpose not meet a noise level requirement 
for 4 months  for example and delay commencement of the offtake contract 
while the project sells LNG at higher prices than in the term sheets.

With regards to the EPC LDs we agree that they should go only to the project 
but we, as offtakers, can not wait for ever for the project to be completed 
with out receiving gas or damages for something that is somehow (directly or 
indirectly) under the project's control. We have 4 months limits to how much 
the project can be delayed on top of all the conservatism that EECC (or 
another EPC Contractor) already built in.  

Section 6
I would like to see some language in this section describing the pricing 
formula associated with expansions.  Structure could be set as in this 
contract where Pg is to reflect GSA costs and where the combined value of 
Pcpi and Pa should be derived to provide an equity return to the sponsors of 
18%.

 We agree that would be better, but we included this section knowing that is 
something that is going to be a very difficult sell with PDVSA, because they 
don't want us to sell down and then keep "controlling" new  LNG businesses in 
Jose. They will oppose this clause as they violently opposed the limited 
exclusivity at Jose that we managed to include in the GSA. We think that 
adding a restriction to the asset's returns now in the draft will make it 
very tough to sell to PDVSA the entire Clause. Thus, jeopardizing our chance 
to control the output of future plants or expansions. We never intended to 
use these off-take agreements as a vehicle to control future LNG volumes. 
Nevertheless, we felt it was a good chance for us to start getting partial 
control of the output. Pushing it too much will back fire and PDVSA will 
clearly realize what our intent is.

Section 7
Where is the bonus calculation?  We did not include it now on purpose. We 
will include it when ever they "remind" us to do so. We want to have another 
fight about the bonus.
Where is the min price? The minimum price is in. We say that one of the  
terms in the price is Pg x En where En is never less than one
I thought you guys were going to trade out CPI for a fixed number? We are 
going to try to do it, but that is first a GSA issue, and we don't want to 
put it here as something firm before we change it in the GSA. We precisely 
bracketed the CPI percentage in the formula because of our thought that we 
want to make it zero  
Have you decided that a WTI index percentage does not help the economics? No, 
we don't have the definitive answer from structuring yet, but our guess and 
based on our meeting with RAC the other day, in which they told us about the 
mess created by an oil escalation in Cuiba (Brazil power plant), we are 
pretty much convinced that oil escalation without oil based LNG sales is not 
convenient. But since we don't have a definitive answer yet we still included 
oil as a possible escalator with a zero weighting (that should have been 
bracketed in the term-sheet, though, and it will).  

Section 10
you have incorporated the GSA default rate for late payment as opposed to the 
Equilibrium rate.  Is this your intent to have a mismatch?
 Yes, we did it on purpose because this will apply also to PDVSA as 
off-taker, and they have a record of paying late so we want them to suffer if 
they do.

you have all new taxes being borne by the project company.  Will the banks 
accept this as the project company will be thinly capitalized.  See section 
18 of the Arcos CTA for ideas if this is an issue.
 The exporter of record will be the project, so the buyer has no business in 
Venezuela other than paying port fees. We do not see any kind of taxes that 
could be imposed on Buyer by Venezuela that would eventually be transferred 
to the project. Banks should be fine with this as this is a risk that 
projects typically take all the time (the heavy crude projects are some 
examples in Venezuela). In addition, the GSA provides for a number of reliefs 
for the Project Company that will help Banks and equity holders to feel 
safer. Although, a large portion of the underlying risk is always there. 

Other
where are the LD calculations explained?  I think you need LDs for GSA 
default and another for plant default.  GSA default should match LD's in GSA 
contract less compensation to plant debt recovery.
 In stead of writing an explicit LD calculation our lawyers suggested that 
the sole use of New York law to rule the deal was simpler and better. New 
York law provides for full market based damages (market price of commodity 
plus extra costs) which is the maximum you can get in a negotiation for an LD 
clause. So, from a legal and commercial point of view we much rather have it 
as it is. We are still discussing w/ Brent Price and Cris Sherman if this is 
sellable to AA for MTM, but our initial view is that it should be since the 
level of LD can not be better. GSA default is market based (provided that 
PDVSA, as we expect, accepts the change we will propose) so the Project 
Company will be able to pay market based damages. For interruption of gas 
supply from PDV for Force Majeure reasons our insurance team is finding out 
if the market will cover such risk so that the project can afford not being 
relieved from performance in such event (this will obviously be to a maximum 
dollar limit to be determined and for a maximum period of time, say 36 months 
- we need time to give you precision on this, but some sort of coverage will 
be available). 

suppose the plant produces 5% less that it is supposed to due to design or 
tech problems (not a FM issue) at commercial hand over.  What happens under 
the offtake agreements?  Will the banks accept this revenue short fall?  Will 
we have to create a reserve?  This may be a big issue with the banks for 
technology reasons and lack of experience in this industry.
  Under the off-take agreements the project pays market based damages if it 
does not meet the contracted volume. We believe that the contracted volume 
that we included in the term sheets though has enough of a cushion for banks 
and equity holders to bear the risk. We are contracting for contractually 
guaranteed production under the EPC which is 3% lower than expected. On top 
of that we are considering LNG production with the richest inlet gas possible 
(meaning a lower LNG volume). This volume is 5% lower than the guaranteed 
production with "Normal" or expected feed composition. Combining these two we 
have a contracted quantity that is 8% lower than the expected production with 
expected feed. On top of this it is important to note that every single LNG 
plant in the world ended up with a production capacity that is at least 10% 
above what was expected (mostly due to EPC Contractors and tech partners 
making very safe assumptions on guaranteed volumes to avoid LDs). Also the 
EPC contract being negotiated provides for pretty severe LD in case of 
production shortfalls that are enough to pay for debt and make equity-holders 
whole. They don't provide though, for damages payable under off-take 
contracts (nobody will take this potentially huge exposure on LDs). However, 
as we explained, we believe that this is a risk that is typically taken by 
producers and that we have already taken a very conservative assumption in 
the volume contracted and that should be beard by the Project Co. Banks will 
most definitely also take a conservative volume assumption, as we already 
did. 

What happens if plant starts producing less for a few weeks until problem is 
resolved? what compensation do the offtakers get? do the banks suffer here as 
well?
 The term sheet establishes an annual quantity as the only standard to 
determine failure to deliver by Seller. It also establishes that deliveries 
should be at rates and intervals that are reasonably constant. The bottom 
line is that the termsheets do not go into all the detail about timing of 
defaults and price differentials. It sets, however, a reasonable standard by 
which if at the end of the year seller did not deliver the full annual 
quantity and a particular month can be identified where the deficiency occur 
based on the "reasonable constant deliveries" provision, damages will be 
payable based on prices during such month. Yes banks suffer here to the 
extent that the cause of the short fall is not insurable.  Nevertheless, 
short periods (weeks) of failures to deliver by seller will really not affect 
the Project Company ability to pay the Banks.  It will have to be some 
prolonged period for Banks to be affected.   

Under a plant FM issue you may not get BI cover for the first 60 days.  Will 
the banks accept this or will they want a reserve established.  Is this in 
your model?
 We are not sure off what the banks are going to require in this regard 
(although, we agree that some sort of reserve or LC is to be expected). Our 
model assumes the cost of an LC for 6 month debt service (which should be 
plenty). The issue here is if MTM is going to be able to live with the same 
or longer grace period for damages to kick in under the termsheet and weather 
damages (not BI) are insurable and to what extent if FM relief is not 
permitted for MTM reasons. The question that follows is: if damages exceed 
the insured limits in a FM event that does not relief the project from its 
obligation to deliver, have the damages have to be senior to debt payments 
for AA to allow MTM to be permitted? If this is so, are the banks going to be 
willing to live with this?, probably not.

insert something on planned maintenance timing and scheduling.
 It is briefly covered in section 9 second paragraph. This will be expended 
in later drafts once the PA is signed and we are home free with regard to 
PDVSA.

insert termination section
 In light of the fact that we will end up being more of an off-taker than an 
asset owner in this project our lawyers suggest that we will get better 
protection if early termination is ruled by what is provided under NY law 
than if we try to right an early termination clause. They point out also that 
90% of LNG contracts are done in this way, having NY law rule the game. They 
point out also that from the project point of view banks are very used to and 
prefer having early termination be ruled by NY law.
  
put something in about the buyer willing to accept entering direct agreements 
for financing requirements?
 We will

Subject: Jose LNG - Off-take

I am enclosing a draft of the off-take termsheets to be included in the 
Participation Agreement between Enron and PDVSA Gas. These termsheets will 
rule the following transactions:

  a) Sale of LNG from the Project to an affiliate of  Enron for the plant's 
output minus PDVSA's off-take

  b) Sale of LNG from the project to and affiliate of PDVSA Gas for the share 
of volumes equivalent their equity participation in the Project Co

  c) Re-sale of LNG from the affiliate of PDVSA Gas to the Enron affiliate 
for the volumes purchased by PDVSA according to b) above

Please let Emilio and I know your comments about them at your earliest 
convenience. Please focus on issues with regard to our ability to MTM these 
contracts, such as the force majeure clause. If you have any comments or 
questions during the weekend you can reach me at 713 304-4264 or Emilio at 
011 5814 330-9016. Otherwise we would like to discuss this with you on Monday.

Thanks for your input and happy Thanks-giving

It is my sincere honor to once again lead the Enron team in this year's 
Juvenile Diabetes Foundation (JDF) walk scheduled to take place on Sunday, 
November 5, 2000, at the Sam Houston Race Park.  I continue to serve on the 
board of JDF representing Enron and will be Enron's corporate executive for 
this year's fundraising efforts.

As many of you may already know, I am an insulin dependent diabetic myself.  
Even though I know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the 
multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day, I cannot 
imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease.  Taking 
insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of 
complications; insulin is simply their life support system and without it 
they would die.

Enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for JDF again this year.  JDF 
is a very efficient organization in which approximately 84% of all money 
raised goes directly to research.  Enron's goal this year is to raise 
$225,000 and we need your help.  Enron has been the number 1 walk team for 5 
years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place!  We need team 
leaders, walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal.  The theme for the 
walk this year is "Knock Out Diabetes" and we would like to have you join us 
for this great event.  The Walk is truly a blast and we had about 500 Enron 
people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it.

If you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader, or if 
you would like to make a pledge, you may call any of the steering committee 
members listed below.  If you are interested in being a team leader, please 
contact one of the following people immediately so that you may be included 
in the first important and informative training session taking place this 
week.

Thank you very much for your support.

Tom,
I am fine with this but our effective date is a call of fairness that depends 
on your view of the middle east adjustment.  I don't want to be hard on this 
and get back a bigger number on middle east by default.  Its up to you and 
your judgement on what you think is appropriate and or a trade with Europe.  
I am fine with your ultimate decision.
Mike

Subject: Enron Japan Plan Split


Mike,

Attached is the proposed plan transfer to EGM for Enron Japan.  These amounts 
have been reviewed and approved by Joe Hirl.  We are still working with Enron 
Europe to gain agreement on the effective date (April 1 or July 1)  - will 
let you know as soon as this is settled.

Here's a summary of the Plan Amounts;

			 Split after 2Q 
			
			 EGM 
Margin*	1Q		                 -   
	2Q		                 -   
	3Q		      3,750,000 
	4Q		      3,750,000 
	2001		      7,500,000 
			
			
Expense	1Q		                 -   
	2Q		                 -   
	3Q		      3,366,377 
	4Q		      3,366,377 
	2001		      6,732,754 
			
			
EBIT	1Q		                 -   
	2Q		                 -   
	3Q		         383,623 
	4Q		         383,623 
	2001		         767,246 

If we end up with an April 1 transfer, EGM will be kept whole on plan (will 
be approx $3.4 MM expense, zero margin).

Please advise if you have any questions or wish to discuss this in further 
detail.

Mike:

Your authorization is required to reserve conference room EB3014 from August 
29 - October 15 for the McKinsey Railroad study.  During this time the room 
will not be available to anyone other than McKinsey team.

My assistant, Angie has received authorization from Lisa Cousino, ENA/EGM 
floor co-ordinator, to utilize EB3014 for the period mentioned, but Lisa 
needs to hear directly from you that this is ok.

Thanks for your help,

Brent,
Excellent update.  I would like to see the breakdown by pieces for a 
potential write-down especially volume difference only and look at a 1 year 
adjustment to begin.
Thanks,

Subject: First Gas Writedown

First Gas is a liquid fuel supply deal executed in May, 1997 that is linked 
to a power plant in the Phillipines.  Volumes were booked at 31,000 barrels 
per day with delivery starting June, 1999 through Dec., 2002.  Fuel 
deliveries did not begin until April, 2000 and have averaged between 
10,000-12,000 barrels per day, well below the volumetric level that was 
booked.   This deficiency is due to delayed plant start-up and reduced 
consumption and has resulted in approximately $1 million per month in accrual 
losses to the Global Products group since April, 2000.  To make matters 
worse, the power purchaser from First Gas has recently announced that they 
are going to minimally dispatch the power plant to which this transaction is 
linked through the end of 2001.

To properly reflect the current volumetric levels associated with First Gas, 
we need to take volumes from the 31,000 barrels per day level that was 
originally booked to approximately 6,000 barrels per day for the remainder of 
the deal.

In addition, freight charges related to this deal have doubled since April, 
2000 increasing from the $.70 originally booked to the current $1.45.  Per 
conversations with John Chismar he expects freight to remain at this level 
for the foreseeable future.

To properly reflect the current costs of this deal, we need to increase the 
Dubai spread to which this deal was booked from $2.91 to approximately 
$3.65.  Initial estimates of the loss resulting from both the volumetric and 
cost proposed write-down of First Gas is $30 million.  We are continuing to 
refine this number and will update you when we get a final amount.

On a final note, Arthur Andersen has repeatedly reviewed First Gas throughout 
2000 and to this point we have been able to spin enough of an argument to 
justify delaying a writedown.  Given the current market conditions discussed 
above (which are publicly known), the size of the writedown and the fact that 
their next review will be for year-end earnings, I believe Arthur Andersen is 
going to require us to write down at least a substantial portion of First Gas 
before they will sign-off on earnings.  Obviously, I have not recently 
discussed this with AA&Co. but I do anticipate this being an earnings issue.

Please call me if you wish to discuss further.  I appreciate any help you can 
give us in this matter.

FYI - see message below re: our potential trip to Mexico City on 5/21.  We're 
pushing to get the meetings back to back but you know how politicians can 
be.  Will keep you posted.  If the meetings can NOT be back to back would you 
want to consider taking one of the smaller company jets?  Your call, I can 
work either way.

Subject: Update on PMI/Ministry of Finance Meeting

Randy:

I just spoke with Pedro regarding the Ministry of Finance Meeting in Mexico
City.  He is hopeful (but not certain) that we can schedule a meeting on
the back end of the PMI session.  I suggest you and Mike continue to keep
the entire day open at this point.   If it turns out that the Ministry of
Finance meeting will be later in the day, Pedro can shuttle you and Mike to
our Mexico City office where you may access phones, desks, etc. during the
interim.

You will most likely meet with the Director General of Credit who is
responsible for managing fx, and financial credit with the international
markets.  He's in a very influential position within the Finance Ministry.

Let me know if you need any additional info at this point. Otherwise, we'll
review the Ministry of Finance document and Maya pricing concepts on
Tuesday, 15th, at 9 am here in our office.

Regards, Eric

Jay,

I like it.

  Two questions. 
1. You didn't address how our investment group will work with other groups, 
specifically, EEL, ENA will (may) be different than how it works (and 
approves) investments with the investments from the other business groups.
2.  You still called it Steve's group.  Do you want to address the issue more 
directly or leave it more ambiguous?

What are your thoughts?

John/Mike
I will be in Houston on 4th and 5th of April.  Matthew Scrimshaw suggested I 
look you up.
It would be great if you could spare me some time to discuss what we are 
trying to do at ETOL and how I might be able to link with what you do.
I have a pretty flexible programme on the 4th  with my return flight to the 
UK at 15:00 on 5th.
If you could suggest a time and your office locations I'd be most grateful.
Best regards
Neil

Mike

Hi. Happy New Year and hope you had a good holiday.

I got married in December and am now looking to leave India. I would like to 
work in Houston because Jaya, my wife, has applied to US MBA schools for 2001 
fall and this will mean that we can be in the same continent if not time zone.

I am coming to Houston next week and was hoping that I could speak with you 
before then about opportunities in Global Markets and if possible set up a 
meeting with you in Houston. 


Regards


Sunil

June 10, 11 ,12 the Canadian Energy Research Institute will host a 
petrochemical industry conference in a mountain resort 60 miles from Calgary. 
Our steering committee (Dow Nova, Williams, Shell chemicals, Canadian Pacific 
Railway, BP) has suggested that we ask you to address delegates on Enron's 
leadership role in e-business. I am making initial contact to explore this 
possibility, and to ask if is possible for you to recommend an alternative 
person within Enron, as I have lately learned you have changed positions. 
This is a high level conference for industry decision makers, which will give 
you an idea for this presentation: not necessarily the IT approach, more of a 
business strategy approach. I look forward to hearing from? you.

Best Regards.

As info. 
 We are working to keep the bid / ask spreads as narrow as possible for each 
of our EOL markets - domestic and international coal, vessel freights and 
emissions.  Volumes for coal and emissions are already up, and freight should 
be a rapidly developing market.

Subject: Sea freight: 1st trade done today

hello John
we started to work on the idea of putting freight swaps on eol during fh may. 
we were ready technically early july, cleared all legal hurdles end july, 
went live on the 1st of august and did our first trade today . and guess what 
the customer is so enthusiastic that he ll make us great advertisement . this 
is the first time ever a shipping transaction has  been made principal to 
principal 100pct  through an electronic media.
fyg we are quoting 2 contracts based on cape size vessels (cargo size 150 000 
tons ) on coal routes . one is south africa to rotterdam and the other one is 
colombia to rotterdam. these routes are  the main routes of the international 
coal group portfolio. 
in terms of volume what we are putting on eol every day is more than what is 
contracted on the normal otc market on a monthly basis.
in terms of spreads existing otc market is working with 0.75 to 1 usd  when 
our spread is now 0.20 usd.

in september/october  we will increase the number of contracts available to 
include smaller vessels and other types transaction (time charter in addition 
to the present contract which are "voyage" type transactions) 
.

Fyi,

We have just traded our first sea freight contract today with Bocimar BV as 
the counterpart.  Bocimar is the biggest Cape size vessel operator in the 
world and they called after the trade to let me know that they think the 
system is great and will be using it to trade regularly.

Cedric, =20

As a follow-up to our meeting,  below are a few comments and ideas regardin=

the Net Works piece of the analyst presentation. =20

I know I sent you a lot of data and presentations, here are a few pages in=

? Why Enron?
? Recent Enron eCommerce Experience
? Lessons Learned

? Enron Today/Enron Tomorrow

Here are a couple of other thoughts and ideas.

We need to emphasize our new businesses outside the energy business=20
(obvious).  Clickpaper.com will be out and live just before the analyst=20
meetings.  This is very exciting and could take the industry by storm=20
(eventually).  Especially with Jeff=01,s comments with the analysts.  This=
=20
should be emphasized with the metals piece.  The concept is that here are 2=
=20
new areas where Enron is going to change the "old economy" businesses and=
=20
industries.  Clickpaper will have real time pricing which is different than=
=20
all the other 15 existing sites.  All of the others are charging 3% fees fo=
r=20
matching buyers and sellers in a bulletin board or auction type of=20
transactions. We will also have that functionality (and will charge 1% or $=
0=20
(we=01,ll update you later) but will also have an EOL type of real time pri=
cing=20
component (this piece will be free).  This piece will not be ready for July=
=20
25th but will be announced publicly and in final development stages (should=

paper and metals is very important for providing a more complete picture th=
an=20
just metals alone.  Also for your information, we are working on 2=20
acquisition deals that will be coming out soon, 1 is to buy a mill and coul=
d=20
be announced next week, which will also clarify and add to the story since =
we=20
will have access to physical pulp and paper.  Paper must be an important=20
piece of the presentation.  Greg Piper is the MD for Clickpaper and he can=
=20
answer any other questions and fill you in and answer more questions.  He c=
an=20
be reached at ext. 36635.

Also, on the "Target Markets" page, I would reorder;  put Lumber underneath=
=20
pulp and paper and think about separating the others as potential markets. =
=20
That way we could actually check off the top 3 as "done" and the others are=
=20
in "incubation" and examination stages.=20

Please draft up your initial thoughts on these items and send me the latest=

A friend of mine, formerly with Bankers Trust, called to see if we are

Merlin Production, a small producer, that thinks there is a large market for 
accessing stranded gas in offshore fields.  If you have an interest let me

Subject: Oman Spot cargo

FYI, the "Hanjin Muscat"  sucessfully delivered our Oman spot cargo at Lake 
Charles and departed without incident on the evening of 24 September

Because of the high price differential (ENA bought the LNG from us at $4.23 
Henry Hub price) we drew down on the LNG heel and thus discharged more LNG 
than ENA had committed to buy.  By doing this, we picked up perhaps an 
additional $50 thousand of income in excess of what was originally intended.  
I expect that our total net income from this cargo will be about $175 thousand

Mary, I would say a couple of things.  I describe Enron's unique culture 
using adjectives like , empowerment, innovation, innovation on steroids, high 
energy, exciting, challenging, cool, a great place to work.  Each one of 
these can be made into a sentence and/or a statement.  

I hope this is what you were looking for.

John, 
You caught me.  I've been hit again with the bug, the 3rd time in November, 
and the combination of drugs has me wide awake.  I did promise Chris that I 
wouldn't run off to the office when this occurs but she didn't tell me I 
couldn't do a lot of emails from home! - there is always a catch!

Actually I'm back to bed to try again after this one.  

Hope all is well in merry old England.

meeting-place this year for the senior energy executives in the region to
discuss all the latest developments in the industry - e-business, regulatory
change, and the subsequent financial impact on both the new and old
economies.

I would like to invite you to give a presentation at the conference.  I have
attached the full program.

We expect 150 very senior delegates from across the energy industry, from
Asia and beyond - oil and gas co's, but also electricity utilities, as well
as exchanges, analysts and investors.  Speakers will come from companies
such as Caltex, BP, Shell, Petronas, Premier and Texaco, and hopefully
Enron.

If you have any questions at all, or would like to discuss your presentation
in more detail, please do not hesitate to give me a call or drop me an
email.

Best regards

Just a reminder of what we discussed regarding the fate of the Singapore 
office. The trader I mentioned was Pat Markey and he moved there about a year 
ago. He has done a great job on EOL and should be able to give you a good 
overview of the Singapore office both pro and con and how it could be 
improved.

Dear Mike:

Glad to hear from you.

The Lichtenstein "Composition No. 4" is exactly like the one you saw except
that it would be a different number in the signed and numbered edition.  The
price is $4,500.00.  That is unframed.  We can frame the artwork like the
Liechtenstein you saw here or if you prefer like the Matisse.  You have that
option.

I will contact the owner and send you an image either by e-mail or by mail.
The window of opportunity to acquire the artwork is limited.

I would love to talk to you personally about the Matisse "Icarus" artwork.
When would be the best time to contact you and Chris?

As I mentioned to you this artwork is hard to find and cannot be easily
replaced.  Please keep in mind that several of our consultants are working
with clients and galleries to place this artwork.  I mention this only to
encourage to contact me if you have serious interest in adding this artwork to
your collection.

I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow.

Most sincerely,

Virginia Repasky
Christopher-Clark Fine Art

04:08 PM ---------------------------
From: Terence H Thorn@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT on 12/22/2000 01:28 PM
To: Rick Bergsieker/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
cc: Mike McConnell/HOU/ECT@ECT 
Subject: Oxy meeting

We just finished the meeting  with Dale Laurance and Casey Olson. Here's a 
recap.

Oxy wanted to meet with Mike for two reasons:

 1) Make sure Enron and Oxy had a project team in place asap and the 
resources are committed to do a world class job on the January 29 submission 
and subsequent presentations. As Mike noted- we are in sudden death overtime 
and the 29th could be the end of the tournament.
 2) Revisit the "street talk" about Enron redeploying capital.

Mike walked through the EGM organization, talked about our stock multiple  
and how an announcement that we were putting huge dollars in Saudi  would 
hurt our stock price.

Dale talked about their low multiple (between 4 and 5), noted that the market 
viewed Oxy as a company that could do deals, buy and sell assets, but really 
wasn't a growth company. They now have a stable cash flow, but need a  new 
beach head in the Middle East to demonstrate they are growing. The point of 
this conversation was to tell us that debt reduction is also a top priority 
so they were also not interested in a big announcement about money being 
dumped into Saudi Arabia

They characterized the Saudi perspective as being one where they are looking 
for strategic partners who will be there for a long time and invest capital. 
They agree on a division of labor: Oxy can do E&P, processing and 
petrochemicals and look to us for pipelines and power plants although Oxy can 
do those too. They realize that only Enron has the marketing, structuring  
and regulatory expertise. 

Casey did revisit his conversation with you about in the end Enron ends up as 
some type of "merchant banker." That's OK in the end- Dale even said they 
would take over our part of any project-- but we can't project that role 
initially. We need to be on the same side of the table as Oxy.


The point here is that we have to be in step with a consistent approach to 
the projects. They expect our competitors to say they'll finance things on 
balance sheet and we need initially to say the same thing although later we 
will open discussions on other ways to finance. Mike and I agree that this is 
probably the biggest sticking point in the discussion today. Oxy believes 
that such an initial statement will never be public and we aren't really 
locked in an on-balance sheet approach. Maybe  we can do this, maybe we can't.

They see this as a year long process with PDA's stretching well into next 
year, and 2002 when the real money would be spent. The short term crisis is  
January 29 and we need a submission with lots of pages: we were criticized 
that although our proposal was well thought through and technically superb, 
it didn't have enough pages- reams of paper to impress  the technocrats.  We 
will also need to prepare a smaller 15 page digest to be used for our 
official February presentation and a three page walk around summary. Casey 
thinks the production center has to be in the US.

We also all agreed that the Jan 29  questions allow us to lay out all of our 
downstream concerns and establish a placeholder for issues that must be 
resolved during the PDA discussions before we would do a project. I have had 
the greatest success around the world when we don't try to force immediately 
on a country  a perfect gas or electric market but adapt to "local 
conditions" and implement the most important first couple of steps with the 
rest to follow later. In this respect,  our projects can include suggested 
regulatory concepts that if successful can be used elsewhere in the Kingdom.

Over and over we came back to the project team which they want on the ground 
in Saudi.  Casey will be 100% Saudi for the foreseeable future and can make 
all decisions. Who will be our lead person with the same authority? They 
don't want to deal with someone who later says Houston changed it's mind ( a 
little arrogant). When can we identify bodies and assignments and location? 
They want full time dedicated people. Either Dale or Casey noted that the old 
Enron would have parachuted a team in by now (Like South America where we 
landed in a swamp and spent the next five years beating alligators over the 
head with a stick). This is a very complicated political and technical 
effort,. The leader has to be good at both. Casey was excited that Rob would 
be assigned to the project (I guess you discussed this with him).

They both were quick to say that the working relationship to date has been 
excellent and that they appreciate the effort we have put into this.

Mike committed that we would go balls to the wall for the 29th deadline, I 
committed that I would designate a project team by the first week in January 
(we had our first conference call yesterday), but Mike said he wanted to 
think about the decision point person and process ( we aren't about to 
sacrifice a deliberative strategic/consensus  thought process because they 
are in a hurry).

We spent a lot of time talking about the process. We agree that the Saudi's 
will eliminate one or two participants, that each project will have subparts 
with different combinations and leads of companies with a master JV on top.   

They minimized the capital investment although they are prepared to spent 
$200-300 million over the next 3-5 years. They see core project 2 costing 
$600 million, 60% Oxy/Enron assuming one other partner and Enron half of 
that. We aren't talking billions (spoken like a true major).

They are sure Exxon /Mobil will be our Red Sea partner if only to earn face  
with possibly Marathon as the other. Exxon is more interested in the chemical 
focus which Oxy will concede to them. Mike noted was that our worst nightmare 
was a partner (Exxon) who would throw away money just to have a presence).  
We were assured that Oxy's only goal was to make money and if he projects 
didn't, they would walk away.

The real danger in the upstream is the risk money for exploration. Oxy hopes 
to hedge this risk with downstream investments (pipelines and plants) and 
hopes that if the exploration is successful and reserves are added it will 
lead to a whole new series of projects.

They are very proud of Oxy's role in this, claim that they were instrumental 
in getting Petry Parkman and Morgan selected as advisors, that Irani is the 
most respected American Arab business man and has  great access in the 
Kingdom, and that they already know what investments partners are acceptable 
to the Saudi's.

We  all left great friends in good Christmas spirit.

>From our perspective:

 Saudi is the largest economy in the Middle east and the driver in 
international oil and liquids markets

 Enron needs to get inside and establish relationships with the key Saudi 
people. We need a foot print in the Kingdom with which to earn their 
respect.  Can we do it with minimal capital investment?

 Saudi is about to embark of a complete electric and gas restructuring, 
regulatory included. They want the repatriation of petro dollars and dollars 
held offshore by Saudi nationals.  The country can be a tremendous source of 
capital.

 It looks like 2001 can be managed with a minimum burn rate with the most 
intense period of activity being in January. We  need to set up the team for 
the January effort. I'll have this done by Jan 1. There is the question of 
sorting out conflicts with other ME priorities.

 Although it may be too soon to answer (we don't know yet what is possible 
but we can shape that outcome), what is the end game, what do we want out of 
Saudi Arabia? 

 We seem to have a clear division of labor and strategy with Oxy although we 
need to sort out what we say about on balance sheet financing. We also need 
to keep in mind that our other yet to be met partners will have a lot to say.

 Oxy wants to take the lead on the Core Venture 2 (Red Sea). I agree- this is 
a perfect laboratory to address all of the market structure issues that will 
make the Kingdom a great place to do business.



  Mike- I'm sure you can add more. Rick -it's up to you if you want to send 
this around to the Saudi team.  Merry Christmas.

Ken,

I'm back.  Sorry for the delay.  It's been crazy here and I'm very backed up 
on emails especially the fun ones like this.

My brief moment in print (very brief) certainly hasn't gone to my head 
especially as an Enron  "B" teamer.  In response to your worker bee comment, 
I can certainly say "buzz" but not someone who can sell that many shares of 
stock!  You are the king.

Your last email was good and I'm not sure I can respond adequately but at 
least I didn't get help!

You win......but you still owe me lunch.

Mike

I see that we are scheduled to have lunch today.   I may have to postpone 
again, I'll let you know later this morning.  I am out all weekend and we 
have to have the final comments on the Analyst Presentation in by sunday 
night so I may be working over lunch.  Actually, I think we are in pretty 
good shape so I will probably be doing lunch but just don't be too mad if I 
have to cancel.

John, 

you and I have spoken of this issue before, and I hope you understand how 
important this is now.  I understand 
about the endemic risk from J Block, etc.  but I need details on how much 
those portfolios add to our var.  
Last night you guys blew var by 3.1 million by adding 4.7 million var.  As a 
result, I am not prepared to go to the board and ask for more.
The best way to approach this problem is by managing the var and making sure 
we have no violations, coming up with detailed reports
indicating exposure by product and trader, etc.  While we have been working 
on this with Brent Price, we are not there yet. 

A violation like this one today after our string of many is particularly 
troubling, esp since we are not keeping the money made over the last two 
weeks.  The MTD P&L, being reported as a little over one million this month 
doesn't help us really.  

I am now going to give out specific position limits to certain traders who 
have had big var swings without the resultant P&L.

We erred in covering our short position in the euro  yesterday simply because 
the President erred in promoting protectionist steel  legislation.? The euro 
has more bearish fundamentals going for it than even  this bit of "bullish" 
news, and we are therefore returning as sellers of the  euro this morning.

I would also like to bring Jeff Shankman with me to the board meeting.  He 
has never attended one.

It has been a long time since i have presented anything to board especially 
like this.  Would you please provide me a copy of the last couple of 
presentations so that I can be consistent and give them the right kind of 
information.

Thanks,

Thanks for the clarification.  I guess I was too serious and in a business

God, or Mike I mean to say-

I think I may have confused you a little. I don't think we need a picture of
you presently (unless you have any nudes, especially a picture of you with a
morning missile). What I was trying to say was that I saw one or more
pictures of you in the brochure the actives prepared for last year's
President's Trophy competition. What I was hoping was that the actives could
have some more of those brochures printed up for distribution. You might
enjoy a copy. I'm not sure, but I assume they will do another one next year.
If so, they might appreciate a new photo if they include an alumni section.
It is basically their deal. The alumni did not help them on this project.

Mike,

Pete Weidler, a friend of mine, recommended that I contact you feeling that
I may be able to help your group. Like you my background is not in
e-commerce. I was most recently President of an oil company operating in
Colombia. I am a manager in the classic sense, experienced in planning,
project valuation, economic analysis, contract negotiations and
acquisitions and divestitures. I am fluent in Spanish having grown up and
worked in Latin America my whole life. I bring a keen awareness of the
Latin culture and, what's more, a strong desire to continue working there.
Do do this I'm considering a career change and can imagine no better
company than Enron to make that change smoothly.

Pete and I both feel that Enron should have a good situation for a person
with my qualifications; unfortunately Pete's group is actually downsizing
and in no position to hire.

I appreciate your time. Best Regards.

Mike,
 It was nice talking to you at the EGM info session on Monday, the 7th at the 
Hyatt.  As we discussed, I am interested in opportunities within your group, 
specifically the LNG arena.  I interviewed and discussed this issue with Greg 
Curran and Doug J Arnell on Tuesday the 8th.  I strongly believe in the 
mutual benefits derived both from my learning and ability to contribute to 
your efforts.  
 I am currently in my second rotation working for Dan Leff and Dick Leibert 
in EES.  I have been at Enron since 1996.  In my former role, I served as the 
controller for GPG Operations Support (CO 423).  There I managed 25 cost 
centers which perform O&M, Procurement, Document Mgmt, and Regulatory 
Services for GPG and other assets across the globe.  My role was the sole 
source for general administration, budgeting, planning, and financial 
reporting.  This included management of $19.5M on a gross basis and 
overseeing the day-to-day operation of the Mustang timesheet system.  I also 
represented my organization as a Subject Matter Expert (SME) for the July 
2000 implementation of SAP within GPG.  
 In my first rotation in Enron Energy Services I performed analysis, 
forecasting, and pricing of power and gas risk management instruments.  
Currently I am working on projects ranging from Customer Satisfaction, system 
development and implementation, budgeting/space management, California Crisis 
Taskforce to new business ventures and cost savings initiatives.  Although an 
American citizen by birth, I have also spent 14 years living in the 
Caribbean.  I am a team player and a very motivated, high energy individual.  
My experience, the responsibilities bestowed, along my willingness to give 
110% will provide a valuable asset to a group.  I would like to generate a 
dialogue with you regarding the issue.  If there are any questions or 
requests of me, please feel free to let me know.  Thank You
 Adrian Woolcock

Hi Eric,

I started last Monday and this is VERY cool. It is also going to be quite a 
challenge, as the deals are much more complex than what I had the chance to 
see in Europe. Seems that I am going to learn a lot!! so far, expectations 
are met.

 I am also writing you because I have been contacted by an associate who is 
very interested in joining the LNG group. He has been working for Enron since 
1996 and has been involved with gas transportation and EES. He heard about 
the Bahama project and thought that he could add tons of value there, as he 
was raised in Jamaica. He also wants to be involved with a group that allows 
him to have international exposure and, ultimately, the possibility of 
working abroad. I am attaching his resume, in case you are looking for people 
for your group.

Have a nice trip back home.
Fernando

Canyon Springs will allow us to book a 10:00am tee time thirty days in 
advance. Once I have confirmed the tee time I will forward directions to the 
course. Should be a fun group. Might even need a practice round at Champions 
prior to the trip.

Congratulations on your new position with Enron Global Markets. Obviously, 
this is very exciting for you and for us. You probably took this job to get 
away from India, but actually John Nowlan's group serves as the fuel manager 
for liquid fuels (naphtha and distillate) on the Dabhol project.  So the 
standing invitation we issued to you when you visited us last still stands. 
Come over when your schedule allows. Marc de la Roche in your group has been 
threatening to get me out on one of the tankers during unloading while 
bucking in the monsoon tidal flow. Maybe you can join me.

I have discussed this with McConnell, who has advised that Skilling will 
probably not approve this deal if it requires Enron equity to appraise 
reserves and if Sherrick is not willing to put equity in.  I have asked 
Sherrick to define his minimal "bottom line" position so that we can discuss 
it with Atlantis.

Sherrick's people got overly aggressive about this and tabled directly with 
Atlantis a new (and in my opinion, way over the top) proposal without my 
knowledge while I was in the air late last week.

Atlantis announced Saturday that they were walking the deal because EGEP's 
request is so outragious.  David Wilson, head of Atlantis,  immediately 
departed Houston for the UAE.  He is here now and is peddling the deal 
actively to others.

I met with David today and got him to agree to give me a couple of days to 
sort this out with Sherrick.  If I can't either get Sherrick on board or get 
UOG to agree to a restructuring that does not require any front-end Enron 
equity, we risk losing this deal.  

At the same time, we have reached agreement with UOG that they will put up 
70% of the $40 million front-end reserves appraisal equity and they will pay 
Enron a promote and front-end success fee that will give us a return close to 
30% and them a return of 18%.

We risk losing this deal over $12 million of Enron equity to appraise 
reserves (and hopefully I can push a bit more of this risk onto UOG to reduce 
the number a bit more.) The deal would also give UOG and Dolphin a strong 
kick-start, and UOG is anxious to get it done.

Will advise after I talk more with Sherrick, UOG and Atlantis.  This deal 
will live or die this week.  I will have major problems with UOG if it dies.

Rick

FYI:  Jeff Sherrick has decided not to invest EGEP equity in Atlantis.  He is 
still ready to endorse the technical viability of the project and to provide 
upstream technical services to us, but is unwilling to invest with us unless 
he has the right to step in to all other Atlantis properties in the region as 
majority interest holder and operator.  

I have felt that EGEP's willingness to be in the project as an equity holder 
would give Joe and you the assurance that this deal was solid from an 
upstream perspective.  However, I plan to continue developing this 25%-30% 
IRR project with only Enron Middle East (30%) and UOG(70%) as equity 
contributors and simply rely on Jeff to endorse the upstream numbers and 
provide upstream tech services.

All

I visited with Jeff Sherrick yesterday on the Atlantis project and want to 
share with the team my understanding of EGEP's decision and what will be 
EGEP's role in the project.  First, Enron Global E & P has elected to forego 
an equity role in the Atlantis project.  From a technical view, EGEP has 
independently verified the structure and gas column in Sharjah/Ajman and has 
an optimistic preliminary view of Umm al Qawain subject to 3-D confirmation. 
EGEP believes that the Atlantis concesions in the UAE offer significant 
upside potential outside of the Sharjah /Ajman and Umm al Qawain Production 
Areas.  It is EGEP's view that Atlantis's greatest expected value is through 
NEWCO, and on the strength of NEWCO's (Enron's) leverage in the negotiation,  
it should not be unreasonable for NEWCO to expect Atlantis to concede express 
farmin rights to Enron to develop and produce new reserves in Atlantis's 
concessions.  Jeff and team are dissappointed that Atlantis has rejected the 
concept, especially since David Wilson appeared to have reacted favorably to 
the idea when Jeff layed it out at the London meeting in July.   EGEP 
believes that the NPV to NEWCO does not provide a sufficient hedge against 
potential slippage due to factors such as price uncertainty, precessing 
tarif, capex, gas GHV, etc, risks which could be mitigated and managed 
through Enron(EGEP) majority ownership of the upside, i.e. earned by farmin 
to the concession blocks.  EGEP has ranked Atlantis against its other 
upstream opportunities based on the current deal and Jeff has decided to 
conserve his limited equity for other investments.  This decision is 
independent of EGEP's commitment to support Enron upstream investments with 
or without equity and EGEP is continuing to develop the Technical Service 
Agreements with Atlantis and NEWCO to fulfill this responsibility.

Best regards,

Bert

Chris,

Thanks for the email.   I certainly understand your situation and 
perspective.  Give me a call when you return and we can discuss it.  We do 
have a lot going on in Net Works and we may have some additional clarity on 
our direction and priorities when you return from your trip.

Thanks for your tips on SF and for offering your home in the wine country.  
Maybe we can take you up on it another time.

Mike

Guys,

I had an interview with a reporter from the Economist yesterday.  He is doing 
a big story on business changes, online changes, Jeff Skilling and Enron. 
Coal came up a lot and i described my enthusiasm for our coal business and 
our growth.  He wants to put some focus on the coal business and i need some 
facts to get back to him.

What percentage of our coal transactions or business is online?
Speed changes on a typical transaction post and pre online?
Other changes you see or products to develop
International effects
Total coal moved (physical and financial) especially online
Other competing exchanges and why ours is better
Other proEnron facts that illustrate our growing business especially as it 
relates to paradigm changes or online changes

Please feed me this info and if there is something specific that you don't 
want me to say let me know that too but go ahead and give me the answer.  I 
need this information pretty quickly.

Thanks,
m

I understood that the approx. selling price was $58 mm (which is the Enron 
book value after the write downs).  Would there be a reason that EOTT would 
not include that investment in their calculations to get to their desired 
return?  There may be something about the commodity deal I don't understand.  
I will get a meeting with all of us so we can decide what to do.

Wes, according to your voicemail this morning, you said the 14% return we 
were giving EOTT was due to the way we've written down the plant.  In fact, 
that is not the case.  It is due to our ability to imbed a 14% return due to 
commodity prices and spread values.  It has nothing to do with the plant, as 
I know the deal to be.  

Thanks for the info.

Mike,

Attached is the proposed plan transfer to EGM for Enron Japan.  These amounts 
have been reviewed and approved by Joe Hirl.  We are still working with Enron 
Europe to gain agreement on the effective date (April 1 or July 1)  - will 
let you know as soon as this is settled.

Here's a summary of the Plan Amounts;

			 Split after 2Q 
			
			 EGM 
Margin*	1Q		                 -   
	2Q		                 -   
	3Q		      3,750,000 
	4Q		      3,750,000 
	2001		      7,500,000 
			
			
Expense	1Q		                 -   
	2Q		                 -   
	3Q		      3,366,377 
	4Q		      3,366,377 
	2001		      6,732,754 
			
			
EBIT	1Q		                 -   
	2Q		                 -   
	3Q		         383,623 
	4Q		         383,623 
	2001		         767,246 

If we end up with an April 1 transfer, EGM will be kept whole on plan (will 
be approx $3.4 MM expense, zero margin).

Please advise if you have any questions or wish to discuss this in further 
detail.

like to hear your perspective.

Mike,

You and had a brief meeting in your office last week, where I introduced 
myself as an old school mate of Pat Wade's.  During our conversation, I had 
mentioned a business plan that I had written last year proposing a b2b 
platform for trading air freight capacity which received strong interest from 
ICG.  You then asked for a copy of it, thinking that Enron could use some 
background on the opportunity in air logistics.   

If you don't mind, rather than send you a year old plan for a business that 
didn't get off the ground, I suggest that I work (on my own time) on a 
document that will speak better to Enron's needs, presenting the air 
logistics industry background and mapping it to potential opportunities that 
utilize Enron's core strengths.  I hope to have this doc done and delivered 
to you by the end of next week. 

Fred Philipson

Subject: MTBE legislation

Today, Senators Bob Smith (R-NH) and Harry Reid (D-NV) will introduce an MTBE 
bill. which is expected to be slightly different than we've seen in previous 
Congresses.  

We expect it to include:  

1) a 4-year date certain to eliminate MTBE, with EPA determining the phaseout 
schedule
2)  a lifting of the 2% oxygenate standard upon perfunctory petition by State 
governors within 90 days from date of enactment
3)  and environmental "anti-backsliding" provision focused only on air-toxics 
and using a 2000 baseline with a 27.5% percent standard (the way I understand 
it right now, RFG must perform 27.5% better than 2000 baseline for 
conventional gasoline)
4) provisions for MTBE producer "transition assistance"

Brief analysis:  

We'll have more details shortly, but the bill looks a little better than 
previous efforts.  A number of bills have been introduced this Congress, but 
this will probably be the leading effort.  

As you know, Enron has led efforts to include the "transition assistance" 
piece -- which is still largely undefined in the legislation -- but we are 
pleased with the inclusion of a "placeholder" while the Senate decides on the 
best approach.  We will continue to lead the development of such incentives 
(which will likely take the form of EPA/DOE funding for MTBE producers who 
convert plants to produce iso-octane or alkylate).

An MTBE ban is of course not good, but a "date certain" gives producers more 
flexibility to determine their options rather than reduce production under 
several steps of a phase out.   Allowing states to get a waiver of the oxy 
standard is probably a given in any legislation, but will face some 
opposition from the ethanol community -- who just want a simple MTBE ban.

The anti-backsliding provision is still being refined, but looks fairly 
lame.  We need more details to make an accurate assessment, but its likely 
that environmental groups will want a bit more.

One political factor -- with Sen. Jim Jeffords leaving the Republican party, 
Democrats will be given control of the Senate Environment Committee, which 
will consider this bill.  They will likely allow Jeffords to chair the 
committee.  The significance is that Sen. Bob Smith (R-NH) is the current 
chair, and has been able to use that position to drive his past bills on MTBE 
-- in losing the chairmanship, his legislation may face a longer road through 
Committee.

I will keep you posted as the legislation evolves.

Mike: 
Understand LNG continues to be an enigma cloaked in a mystery for Enron.  We 
are continuing to expand our coverage and knowledge base of this marketplace, 
especially in the Western Hemisphere and would like to meet with you to 
discuss our observations and learn more about Enron's desires in this arena.  
Also, we have a meeting planned in D.C. in late June, entitled "LNG's Role in 
North American & Caribbean Gas Supply."  With the U.S. hunger for gas and El 
Paso, AEC and other's announcements of new projects, the meeting should be 
constructive, especially with DOE and FERC involvement.  See summary below.
Let me know when you might be available to discuss the LNG marketplace.  
We've just completed a white paper, entitled "Atlantic-Basin LNG: A Whirling 
Supply/Demand Balance."  You may find our conclusions of interest.

*********************************** 
TITLE:  LNG's Role in North American & Caribbean Gas Supply 
DATE/LOCATION:  Washington D.C., June 27-29 
SUMMARY:  The winter of 2000/2001 confirmed the shift in the United States 
from a buyer's to a seller's market. Gas supplies for North America ran short 
as demand rose from colder weather, higher electricity demand and shortages 
in storage from the previous year.  More and more supply is shifting from the 
U.S. Gulf Coast to Western Canada as offshore exploration in the Gulf of 
Mexico has proven disappointing.  U.S. demand for power generation is 
expected to keep gas demand high through the summer of 2001, siphoning off 
gas that would have been destined for storage.  
Meanwhile during the long gas bubble of the 1980s, drilling rigs and 
experienced field personnel dwindled from thousands to several hundred.  The 
current rig count for North American gas exploration and production is near 
full capacity at just over 600 rigs, so the industry is constrained on how 
quickly it can recover.  
The U.S. has not experienced shortages of natural gas like this since the 
1970s and early 1980s when it was feared that the nation would run out of gas 
in 10 years.  Four LNG import terminals were built to supply natural gas from 
North Africa (Algeria).  These terminals are capable of supplying up to 5% of 
total U.S. gas consumption (about one trillion cubic feet per year).  Plans 
are underway to have all four terminals fully operational by the end of 2002; 
however, more are needed.  
Conventional wisdom is that no new terminals would be built in the United 
States due to EPA laws and local citizen protests to any facility perceived 
to be unsightly or dangerous.  Now, El Paso (a company that was burned by 
Congress in the 1980s by the ruling that take-or-pay LNG contracts with 
Algeria were invalid) is challenging conventional wisdom. They have announced 
plans for six new terminals to be built in North America: three in the United 
States and three in Mexico.    New LNG plants in Venezuela, Algeria and 
Northern Australia might supply these terminals. 
Other companies, such as Enron and AEC, have announced plans to build 
terminals in the Caribbean to supply gas to independent power production 
(IPP) plants ranging from 400 to 1000 megawatts.  Moreover, LNG facilities on 
Caribbean Islands close to Florida might export gas or electricity via 
undersea pipeline and cable.  Floating offshore LNG terminals may also offer 
a means to bring LNG into the United States with less environmental and 
community concern.  
The June 27-29 conference, entitled "LNG's Role in North American & Caribbean 
Gas Supply," will cover the dynamics that are leading to North American gas 
supply shortages, how long they are expected to last, and what source of 
natural gas are available from conventional sources to meet demand.  The 
conference will then focus on opportunities for LNG, including the capacities 
and timing of current terminals, the prospects for new mainland and offshore 
terminals, and the opportunity for broader terminal networks in the 
Caribbean, including those facilities that might supply gas or electricity to 
the United States.

Nobody in my shop has seen any of this.  I'm not sure what Rick is doing with 
Skilling, and I am not in a position to respond to the outcome of their 
meeting.  Eric Gonzales needs this ship, or at least play the card with 
either British Gas or BP/Amoco for fuel to supply the spanish plant.  Eric is 
frustrated as well, and nobody has done any economic or commercial study on 
the exmar option.  I'll phone Bergsieker and see what I can find out.  
Thanks.

Jeff,

Two quick points:

1.  We wanted to give you a heads-up in case you weren't aware - Rick 
Bergsieker is planning to meet with Skilling sometime this week (believe 
post-Wednesday) to talk about the exercise of the first Exmar option.

This option expires on September 8th, an extension from the original expiry 
of 31 August.
Option 2 (for a third vessel - to expire 30 November) will expire along with 
option 1, if option 1 is not exercised.
Option 1 is US$1,000/day more than the original vessel.  Option 2 is 
US$1,500/day more than the original vessel.  (The original vessel is 
US$51,850/day fixed + US$10,790 O&M escalating)
As discussed earlier, Bergsieker's group is offering the use of the Hoegh 
Galleon (Mystic Lady) to Kogas as an incentive for them to sub-charter the 
second Exmar vessel from us.
While we are not aware of the terms of the sub-charter agreement, we do 
perceive the shipping constraint in the industry to be most acute in the next 
3 years, and thus not the best use of the Hoegh Galleon.

We are under the impression that Bergsieker also plans to use this 
opportunity to discuss "LNG Strategy and Oversight", specifically his group's 
future role in it.  Please see the attached presentation to this end.



2.  We had a planning meeting with Eric today and are pushing ahead on an 
initial business plan to be delivered at the end of the week.  We expect to 
cover the following: 

Opportunities for Enron in this market
Value - where we can extract it
Assets - how best to utilise them
Resource planning
Goals

Please let us know if there is anything further you would like included at 
this point, or if we can answer any questions regarding any of the above.

Thanks,
Merritt & Brad

I propose to structure Weather Risk Management in Europe as follows:
 
I have responsibility and authority for all weather related activities 
including: trading (incl. EOL), structuring, origination, research, etc... 
for all of Europe with the exception of Finland, Norway and Sweeden.  I will 
run Europe out of the London office with people reporting directly to me.  
Accordingly, I will allocate V@R and delegate trading authority to personnel 
in the London office. 

I anticipate having Paul Murray run our activities in London. Janine Juggins 
in the London Tax department is establishing the necessary entities and 
addressing the relevant tax issues.  Simon Thurbin in London who reports to 
Todd Hall is identifying a book administrator for our group.  Cindy Horn 
again in London is securing space for an initial 8 to 10 individuals.  We 
have hired an assistant who is multilingual to assist in the setting up of 
our activities.  We are working with Stuart Reed in Houston IT and Brian 
Hudson in London IT (coordinating with Oslo) to ensure that we have the 
infrastructure necessary to trade weather.

In addition to Paul Murray, Ross McIntyre, and the assistant, Catherine 
Woolgar will return to London.  We have also identified an individual in 
London to provide research support. For sturcturing, we will send one 
individual for the Houston group and hire one new employee already identified.

Paul Murray will focus on the management of the office, relationships within 
Europe and the execution of large structured trades.  All other individuals 
in the London office will have dual reporting with a dotted line to Paul and 
a direct line to the group leaders in Houston to ensure continuity and 
accountability.

With respect to Scandinavia, I propse that those activities be treated as 
completely separate with their own V@R and trading authority.  Their 
activities should be limited only to Scandinavia.  The Houston group will 
share infomation and knowledge in the same way that we would with other desks 
within Enron.  Should any of the groups reporting to me wish to take on a 
Scandinavian position, they will have to do so through the Oslo weather 
group.  Likewise, should the Oslo weather group wish to take any weather 
positions outside of Scandanavian, they will need to do so through me.

Paul Murray and I will develop a new budget for Europe taking into 
consideration the time needed to establish our activities.  Oslo will retain 
responsibility for the European budget as originally proposed by Thor Lien.

Yesterday's meeting in Bombay among OLNG, DPC and Denton Hall (OLNG's lawyer) 
went very well.  DPC did a great job of describing the current situation in a 
balanced manner (yes, there are both positives and negatives).  OLNG was 
pleased with the information they received.

One concept that became apparent is that there may be two agendas within 
Oman----(a) OLNG's agenda, which is to cooperate to make the project a 
success, even if it involves some renegotiation and (b) Shell's agenda, which 
may be to force the project into default to create an opportunity for Shell 
to step in and take control of the only LNG terminal that will be built on 
the west coast of India in the foreseeable future.

The Omani government is contemplating a visit to Delhi to initiate 
government-to-government talks to help sort this out.  Dabhol is one of 
several projects that Oman had hoped would successfully build ties with 
India---and each of the projects has run into snags because India has not 
held up its end of the deal.

I had seperate talks with Wade/Jim about the forward path within Enron.  The 
three of us believe that DPC should consider either going short LNG or 
replacing at least a portion of its LNG contracts with an EGM supply 
contract, with EGM deciding what to do about coverage (i.e., short or long).

On a separate note, I met today with the head of Adgas in Abu Dhabi to 
explain the status of DPC.  They are happy that we are keeping them informed 
of potential problems, even though there has not been any default under their 
contract with DPC/MSEB.  At the end of the meeting, they volunteered their 
willingness to work with Enron to re-deploy the DPC cargoes if needed.  They 
recognize that pricing may have to change to accomplish this.

Rick

Subject: Health Clubs -- NY

Jeff and Mike,

Some of our employees in NY have asked whether we would be offering the same 
Health Club reimbursement as what Enron Metals offers in NY.

Ultimately, it is a business cost, not an HR decision.  Metals reimburses up 
to $500/year which seems very reasonable.

I think it would be good to offer this to even the playing field with Houston 
based employees.

Thanks,
Shanna

Mike - I think we are doing a good job of isolating ourselves from the direct 
risk of owning synfuel machines.  The equity owners are the ones at risk for 
any amendments to Section 29 of the tax code.  Further, we have identified 
the "Class A" machines in the market, those with the strongest PLR 's, legal 
facts, and credit worthy owners, and have concentrated our activities on only 
those machines.
  
We will be responsible for supplying coal to the machines, a short position 
we enjoy today with our term sales of equity coal to Florida Powers' synfuel 
group and traded coal to Sempra, and act as sales agent (obviously with 
obligations to sell) for the resultant synfuel. The deals we are currently 
negotiating with AIG and PacifiCorp are even more favorable then our Sempra 
deal in that we will not be acting as operator of the machines.  We also 
expect to receive mark to market  accounting treatment on the new deals.  As 
point of reference we think AIG will be worth about $25 mm and PacifiCorp 
north of $50 mm.  Although we have yet to mtm the Sempra deal, it is worth 
about $25 mm on a mtm basis. 

Between the above three deals we have over $100 mm of potential income this 
year.  In addition we will enter into long term short positions with the 
machines, which will allow us to expand our physical flows, and continue to 
grow our business.  As an example, this year we will deliver about 12 - 15 mm 
tons of eastern coal.  If we successfully conclude the AIG and PacifiCorp 
deals, we will move an additional 11 - 13 mm tpy of eastern coal.  Sempra 
will add another 2 mm tpy, for a total of 13 - 15 mm tpy.  We will be in a 
position to virtually double our physical flows of eastern coal next year.

Synfuel has already had a significant impact on a number of regional markets. 
Not only do we want to be in the synfuel business, we need to be in the 
business in order to understand, anticipate, and take advantage of rapidly 
changing market dynamics.  Synfuel represents a significant, fundamental 
change in the coal business.  This changing market  will present new 
opportunities for us to develop and exploit.  The key obviously is to be a 
major player in both the synfuel and underlying coal markets in order to take 
advantage of the information flows generated by each market. 

We are already in the process of meeting with international customers about 
supplying them with synfuel.  We have received a favorable reaction from both 
the international utilities and steel mills.  We will gain a significant 
competitive advantage in the international market by being in a position to 
offer synfuel not only through Pier IX in Virginia (Sempra), but also through 
New Orleans (AIG and PacifiCorp - via terminal sites on the Ohio River 
system).

We have asked our regulatory people to stay on top of any activity in 
Washington, and to date synfuel has not been a significant political issue.  
Jordan has directed our outside tax people to monitor the IRS' temperature,  
and their response to any letters they receive regarding synfuel from members 
of Congress or the industry. The noise in the system has been primarily 
generated by Arch Coal Co. who are not active in the synfuel market; and the 
State of West Virginia, who would like to tax the production of synfuel. 

The tax issue is one we will try to solve by pushing back on the equity.

 Arch is no match for the combined legal and lobbying capabilities of the 
large players now in the synfuel business - Florida Power, SCANA, PGE, AIG, 
Sempra, PacifiCorp, Kentucky Utilities, TECO, Keystone Conemaugh, DQE, 
Norfolk Southern, Fannie Mae, Drummond, Peabody (Lehman Bros.), Alliance 
(Chase), Massey (Fluor) and Southern Company Services. In addition Aquila. 
PSE&G, Duke, CP&L, VEPCO, Santee Cooper and others are working to locate 
machines at their river terminal and generation sites.

I will be in Pittsburgh and West Virginia all of next week.  I would like to 
schedule a meeting time for the group, and I will call in - preferably Monday 
mid - afternoon or Tuesday late afternoon.  Angie will coordinate with 
everyone to set a convenient time.

Thanks,

George

George,

I would like to have a brief (30 minute) meeting about the noise in the 
political system about synfuel and reaffirm Jordon's viewpoint on Section 29 
credits.  This is big issue and without this reaffirmation I believe we will 
have approval issues with RAC and others.  I want Jeff and/or I in the

Subject: wed aftn/thursday

I will be in the office on wed aftn and all day thursday.  I would like to 
catch up with all of
you.  not sure of people's schedules but please advise me of your 
availability and hope 
most of you can make it for dinner on thur.  I will list some important 
things to me that I  would
like to discuss and propose some thoughts on positive changes for 2001.

teamwork/communication/teaching/guidance/leadership -   these are the major 
areas we should be
thinking about how we can improve.  

teamwork - I feel we look at each commodity (crude/light distillates/middle 
distillates/heavy distillates/lpg/
petrochemicals) as a separate business.   try to identify team leaders to 
provide direction for that business,
establish resources required to meet proposed budgets, and work on individual 
limits for the traders in those
groups.  

communication - once we have established global teams this should improve 
significantly.  'the road to hell
is paved with good intentions' and until traders bonuses are directly tied to 
the profitability of someone in 
another office I don't think we will communicate as effectively we need to.  
we have very few niche markets to
exploit that provide us with guaranteed revenues or allow most of our 
physical traders the ability to trade well
without a strong understanding of the push/pull forces at work from the other 
centers.   for the last two years
this has been cited a main area for improvement.  to get to where we want to 
be I feel it has to be done through
global books.   

teaching - given that the growth of the group has shifted away from hiring 
from the outside and toward internal
recruiting we need to focus on how we develop and keep young talent.  also, 
given the lack of depth in our
trading group it is important that our best traders be given the additional 
responsibility for development of 
talent in their teams.    


guidance - I feel that if  we move toward smaller business units it will be 
easier for individuals to understand
what the strategy is and what their specific role in that strategy is.  we 
lost a lot of people at this time last year
and the common complaint amongst all of them was they couldn't see where this 
group was headed.

leadership - with a group of 114 people at last count it is important to 
start thinking about ways to encourage
more people to make a greater  personal investment in making this group a 
success.  not just meeting a
budget but also in creating a  business that will survive the exit of  any 
individual.   a business that will have
a competitive advantage and that those involved in it will be highly 
motivated to keep growing.   

if there is consensus on the need to improve upon the above then we can 
analyse how we go about it.
I believe that by going toward global books we could improve upon many of our 
weaknesses.  chemistry
is the major concern on a such move but best looked at in context of each 
group.  

there are many other important issues such as eol, marketing team, research 
group, recruitment, etc
but I honestly think we have to focus first on how do we make most with the 
exisitng group and then
figure out how to try to build upon it.

look forward to seeing you on weds aftn or thursday and please email when/if 
you have free time to
meet up.


thanks,

chris.

Mike/Jeff

Attached you will find the first draft of the B-plan for Europe.
Please give me feedback on it and I will finish it.



When it comets to limits for European Weather I would say that we within the 
next 6 to 12 months would need $3 million ( same as world wide weather today)
So we need to discuss this more before I type up the formal limit request 
letter.

As a follow-up to our meeting,  below are a few comments and ideas regardin=

the Net Works piece of the analyst presentation. =20

I know I sent you a lot of data and presentations, here are a few pages in=

? Why Enron?
? Recent Enron eCommerce Experience

Here are a couple of other thoughts and ideas.

We need to emphasize our new businesses outside the energy business=20

(eventually).  Especially with Jeff=01,s comments with the analysts.  This=

should be emphasized with the metals piece.  The concept is that here are 2=

new areas where Enron is going to change the "old economy" businesses and=

all the other 15 existing sites.  All of the others are charging 3% fees fo=

answer any other questions and fill you in and answer more questions.  He c=

Also, on the "Target Markets" page, I would reorder;  put Lumber underneath=

That way we could actually check off the top 3 as "done" and the others are=

Subject: Opportunity for Enron

Good afternoon Mike,

My name is Chad Tipton.  I am currently a Development Support Manager with 
EES in the Integrated Asset Management (IAM).   Recently, I  had the good 
fortune to meet, Ron Hosmer.  He represents a company called IdleAire 
Technologies, Inc..  IdleAire is a startup company started in 1999.   
IdleAire has developed a system to eliminate truckdrivers from having to idle 
their trucks while on long haul overnight stops.  Their plan is to electrify 
truckstops and install remote HVAC units to eliminate truck idling.  Also, 
these units provide cable TV and internet services.  They have already 
piloted the technology in several truckstops in the Knoxville, TN area.

IdleAire's  goal is to: 

"........evolve the nation's truck stops and travel centers into the largest 
truck stop electrification network in the world. We are taking truck stop 
electrification to the next level. Our travel center conversions provide 
heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) at every parking space. We 
also provide drivers in-cab telephone, Internet and television."

Idle Air has caught the attention of many interest groups in Washington, 
D.C.  Ron tells me that they have already gained support from Tennessee 
congressmen, including Jimmy Duncan and  Van Hilleary.   Also, former House 
Speaker, Newt Gingrich is on the board of directors of IdleAire 
Technologies.  These individuals support this technology because it reduces 
emissions and helps state quality for CMAQ funds.  

I had mentioned to Ron, that I worked for Enron and informed him about what 
we do.  He and I both felt that Enron may be interested in developing a 
strategic partnership to take their technology to market.   Ron said that 
they are looking for a strategic partner with energy related experience and 
the capital to invest in this project.  

Enron would benefit in several ways:

1.  Greater than average returns.

2.  Increased publicity and recognition in Enron's environmental role.  (EPA 
Energy Star Label, EPA Climate Protection Award, etc....)
 
3.  Increase markets for electricity and possibly gas.

4.  Maintain Enron's title of innovation leader.

5.  Open a whole new market the energy services group. (EES)

I believe this opportunity is very synergistic with Enron's business model.  
If you would be interested in talking with Ron, I would be happy to introduce 
him to you.  They have a  very comprehensive business plan that lays out 
their business in detail.   I have arranged for him to provide us with an 
executive summary of the business.  You can also find out more about the 
company by visiting their website at:

www.idleaire.com

Thanks for your time.

Chad Tipton

Subject: Liquids VaR violation

Liquids VaR for effective date Dec. 06 is $8.5MM, a seven percent violation 
of its limit.  The cause of the violation was due to the following factors.
Company wide crude position got shorter 6.3MM barrels
Short NG from Jan-Feb-01 of 1.2 BCF.  (EOL trade placed in error, position 
Nowlan intended for was 10 contracts/month instead of 10 contract/day.)

With component VaR attached below, it is clear that crude product resulted 
the most VaR increase.  Keeping everything constant, if Nowlan gets out of 
his NG position, VaR would be $7.8MM.

Subject: Coal information

Guys,

I had an interview with a reporter from the Economist yesterday.  He is doing 
a big story on business changes, online changes, Jeff Skilling and Enron. 
Coal came up a lot and i described my enthusiasm for our coal business and 
our growth.  He wants to put some focus on the coal business and i need some 
facts to get back to him.

What percentage of our coal transactions or business is online?
Speed changes on a typical transaction post and pre online?
Other changes you see or products to develop
International effects
Total coal moved (physical and financial) especially online
Other competing exchanges and why ours is better
Other proEnron facts that illustrate our growing business especially as it 
relates to paradigm changes or online changes

Please feed me this info and if there is something specific that you don't 
want me to say let me know that too but go ahead and give me the answer.  I 
need this information pretty quickly.

Thanks,
m

Jannell grabbed me today to ask where we stand as I think she still has an

anyone in power marketing and she has not. Could you have Janet talk to her 
so we can either move forward or move on. thanks.

Joe, 

Thanks for the email.    I am looking forward to the trip and learning more 
about what you are doing thus how we can help.  If we would have had any idea 
that Europe could have been as big as it has become, we would have done some 
things differently and we can get a head start with Japan.  Thursday sounds 
great and just let me know about Friday.  Is Anthony in japan during the 
trip?  Remember,  I am not a technologist and therefore can't discuss 
technology specific applications just the business concepts and potential 
ideas and opportunities.

A couple of other questions about the trip.  Do you want me to make any 
presentations while i am there or simply talk about our plans?  Also, what is 
the appropriate dress code.  I am assuming suits but i didn't want to make 
any assumptions about new cultures.  Do you have any cultural facts that you 
can fax me about the do's and don'ts of both cultures?  Do I have clear 
instruction how to take the train from the airport.  I normally get a driver, 
I am uncomfortable in new countries that I can't speak any of the language.  
If there is a way to get lost, I'll find a way.

One more item, could you please have your assistant set up a message for me 
at the hotel.  I am usually very stiff and sore after a long trip and it 
really helps.  Make sure it gives me a enough time to arrive to the hotel 
after the trip.  I would also prefer a female if that is acceptable to the 
Japanese culture.

Thanks,
Mike

Mike,

We are looking to accomplish a number of things while you are here over 
Thursday and Friday.  Thursday's schedule is fairly set, and we are working 
on Friday.  Thursday morning through to the afternoon we would present to you 
the current state of the business and the initiatives/proposition/etc for 
enron.co.jp.  This would take us through mid afternoon.  We would then go 
over to EPower and we would ask you to give a talk on the state of technology 
at Enron and the initiatives within Net Works.  We would bring EJ over to 
EPower for your talk.  Afterwards we would have drinks with the main 
commercial team at EPower and EJ.  Dinner to be arranged for a smaller 
group.  On Friday, we would like to use the time to set up some meetings with 
key IT/tech companies here in Japan.  To date, we have not yet met any of 
these companies, but there is currently an extraordinary amount of activity 
in the country.  We are looking to leverage some of Enron's banking 
relationships to get as high a level meeting as possible with the likes of 
Softbank.  We are also asking for other suggestions from the banks.  We are 
also considering a potential talk with the American Chamber of Commerce on 
Enron and Enron Technology.  The ACCJ is one of the most active and largest 
chambers in the world and bring in some quite interesting speakers.  We will 
have more on this.

For the weekend we have recd some suggestions from the Hotel and will pass 
these along to you shortly.

I will be travelling with you on Sunday on the trip to Seoul.

Joe

Joe, 

I am looking forward to the upcoming trip.  

Everything is all set for Korea but what do you suggest as an agenda for my 
two days in Tokyo?  Also are there some presentations or items that i could 
review before I arrive that you believe might be helpful?  I will also be 
there over a weekend, I would like to do some site seeing on Sat and Sunday 
(my flight to Korea leaves on Sunday late afternoon).  I would appreciate 
some suggestions and I will need a guide, could you have someone arrange it 
for me?

Thanks, and Cathy will co-ordinate everything.

fairly priced at $9,500. but will give you a $500. discount if this helps
your situation.  The crating will be $150. and the gallery will cover
insurance.
May Thanks,

Mike:

 Hope you had a safe trip home.  During the reception when you and Mark were 
here, I talked about the need for an additonal senior Enron guy with project 
development experience and said I was talking with two internal candidates at 
the time.   Both have fizzled out.  I seem to recall you mentioned Rick might 
be available/interested if we could get over his possible title and reporting 
concerns (Senior VP and Management Committee Member at E-Power reporting to 
our Japanese president, Mr. Seguchi).  If you think this is an option, I 
would appreciate if you would mention the role to him and ask him to give me 
a call or send me an e-mail and I will follow-up.

Thanks, Carey

I see that we are scheduled to have lunch today.   I may have to postpone 
again, I'll let you know later this morning.  I am out all weekend and we 
have to have the final comments on the Analyst Presentation in by sunday 
night so I may be working over lunch.  Actually, I think we are in pretty 
good shape so I will probably be doing lunch but just don't be too mad if I 
have to cancel.

FYI, I think this is interesting.  I won't be able to attend but do you have 
any time to see some of this.  The morning looks interesting.  What do you 
think?

Mike:

On Tuesday, January 30, 2001, selected business units within EES will be 
sharing their business and marketing plans for 2001. These plans incorporate 
the lessons learned from last's year activities. The Bear Trap program was 
initiated two years ago to help our Origination teams filter down the 
universe of prospects to those offering the best probability of closing 
deals. 

This year we will have the most comprehensive Bear Trap session ever.  We 
want you to be part of this exciting process and to broaden the relationship 
we have with you and your teams.  Come and join me on Tuesday, January 30th, 
at the Aerial Theater in Bayou Place, downtown Houston, starting at 7:00 AM 
with breakfast and continuing until 5:30 PM.  If you have not RSVP'd yet, 
please have your office call Julie Davidson at x- 36882 to confirm your 
attendance.

See you there.

Marty Sunde

Peter,

Thanks for your voicemail and email.  Your resume is impressive and I have 2 
thoughts.  Most of our efforts in EGM are not asset related but I would 
suggest you contact 2 people:  Eric Gonzales for LNG activities and possible 
construction projects and Rick Bergseiker, Middle East and also co-heads LNG.

Thanks and good luck.

Mike

Hello Dr. Jacobs -

Mike asked me to follow up with you to pass along his schedule for his visit 
to OU in April.  Due to Mike's heavy schedule, he said that he plans to be 
there on Thursday for the lecture and he will be happy to join the group at 
The Mont following the lecture, but unfortunately he will need to return to 
Houston on Friday morning.  He asked me to pass along his regrets for being 
unable to attend the banquet on Friday evening and the Board meeting on 
Saturday.

I have contacted the Montford Inn to reserve a cottage for Mike, but they 
said they are booked.  They also said that they are holding 6 rooms for the 
OU Special Events group for April 19th.  If one of the six rooms is not being 
held for Mike, can you please suggest another hotel or inn.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.  Thank you.

Cathy'/Mike.

Thanks for the prompt response and the quotes. I will certainly use one of
them and will use the picture we currently have of Mike on file in the
Penney's Leadership Program.

Mike, I think there might be several of the Board of Advisor members
attending your class on April 19th. Was wondering if you might consider
joining some of them for a beer at The Mont afterwards, since it appears you
will not be able to attend the Board of Advisors meeting on Saturday, April
21st. I know they would like to have the opportunity to meet and visit with
you.

Again, thanks for the promptness in getting back to me.

Hi -

Mike asked me to send you this message with the quotes that follow below.
Mike wanted me to pass along that he graduated from OU with a BBA in 1982.
His major was Petroleum Land Management with an emphasis on Law.  I have
attached the most recent copy of his bio for any additional information you
may need.

(See attached file: MSM BIO CEO EGM.doc)

Quotes:

"The Energy Management Program is the reason Enron began recruiting at OU.
The Program's course study reflects the changing energy business and gets
students prepared for tomorrow."

"The changes that have occurred in the creation of the Energy Management
Program is the primary reason Enron is recruiting at OU."

"The innovative Energy Management Program reflects the changes that are
occurring throughout the energy industry."


I hope this will help.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks.

Subject: Executive Position Within Enron Global Markets

Hi Mike:

I talked to you briefly earlier today immediately after the "Enron at a 
Glance" session.  We discussed the subjects of Enron looking at the purchase 
of GATX Terminals Corporation and the hiring of an individual from GATX 
Terminals.

As I mentioned earlier, I know an individual who has worked for GATX 
approximately 20 years in several capacities who is interested in joining the 
Enron team.  His name is Steve Denney and he resides in Chicago, IL.  He 
travels each week to Houston for his current job as President of GAXT 
Products Services (GPS).  Capacities within the GATX organization that Steve 
has held include:

President of GATX Products Services (GPS)
Executive Vice President Domestic Sales and Marking for GATX Terminals
Southern Region Business Unit Manager (Texas, Louisiana, and Florida) for 
GATX Terminals
General Manager of Calnev Pipe Line Company (a subsidiary of GATX Terminals)

I have worked with Steve in different capacities since 1991, and think he 
would be a GREAT asset to the Enron organization.  I would like to introduce 
the two of you to see if there is a fit for Steve within our company.  You 
expressed interest earlier today when we talked.  If you are still 
interested, could you please advise me on what steps to take from here?

I appreciate your time in considering Steve as an employee and look forward 
to pursuing him as an Enron team member.

Thank you,
Gene

NI was quite proud that they showed good results for last year.  However, the 
reason lies with the sale of cross shareholding interests (equity in other 
companies) and other assets.  The reality is that their operating profits 
were way down.  This is obviously why the pressure is still on.  See table 
that appeared in the news.

This is Chris Love with ETS Technology Infrastructure.  I was asked to check 
the link mentioned below because Gayle said that it was not working on her 
computer but that you replied to her telling her that it was functioning.  
The link is on http://ecinside.enron.net/apps/jdf.nsf ... I have tried this 
link in 3 different browsers on 4 different computers and it is not working.  
Maybe the link is there but it's got high traffic, but we've tried it several 
times over the last hour and it is not responding, the message that we're 
getting is that "A connection could not be established with the server."  
Please respond.

Sunday, November 5th, is the big day.  Although we have less than two weeks 
left, we still have several exciting fundraising activities taking place.  
All walkers should continue getting pledges and watch for further 
instructions on turning in the walk forms.  Everyone has done an incredible 
job this year.  Great news, we are getting very close to reaching our goal, 
but if we want to continue to be the number one walk team in Houston, we need 
to continue with our fundraising efforts.  Please plan to join us for the 
following activities this week:
 
Silent/Cyber Auction - The JDF Silent Cyber Auction will open for bids on 
Wednesday, October 25th, at 8:00 a.m. and will close on Thursday, October 
26th, at 4:00 p.m.  You may access the Cyber Auction to place your bids at 
8:00 a.m. on Wednesday, October 25th, by launching the website at 
http://ecinside.enron.net/apps/jdf.nsf  or go to the Enron home page on the 
Intranet and click on the JDF Cyber Auction.  For more information, contact 
Sophie Patel at ext. 35055 or Eddie Sera at ext. 30480.  

Bake Sale and Raffles - Just in time for the Holidays!  On Friday, October 
27th, we will have several groups selling delicious baked goods on the second 
floor level of the Enron Building outside the Energizer.  In addition, we 
will have representatives from some of our walk teams available for the 
purchase of raffle tickets at the same location.

For all that are not signed up, please join us in the walk.  You still have 
time.  It will take 2 minutes to fill out a walk form, you get a great 
Enron/JDF T-shirt for collecting or donating $25 or more, and will join 
hundreds of Enron employees and approximately 10,000 Houstonians for the walk 
on Sunday, November 5th, at the Sam Houston Race Park.  I promise this will 
be a blast.  The Enron tent will be great again this year!  We will begin 
with a continental breakfast prior to the walk and when everyone returns from 
the walk we will have music, balloons for the children and wonderful Frankie 
Mandola's hamburgers, hot dogs and fries.  Parking at the Sam Houston Race 
Park is free.  You will be part of something very worthwhile and it will make 
you feel great.  This is a world class event.

Please contact any of the following Steering Committee members to make a 
donation, sign up as a walker, or ask any questions you may have.  Come join 
the fun.

Blanca Bollom  X66091
Deb Gebhardt  X39606

This weekend, Cole, my thirteen year old, and I attended the birthday party 
for Dorothy's five year old daughter, Caitland. What ever happended to the

definitely not stayed the same.

Anyway, Dorothy asked about you and I encouraged her to call you, and I think

Mike,
? You will probably receive a call from the  top JDRF Legislative Volunteer, 
Leah Mullin. Her husband, Leo Mullin, is CEO of  Delta Airlines and they have 
a diabetic son. They are also very friendly with  the Brennemans.
? Leah would like to enlist the help of  yourself and any Enron 
powers-that-be for support from Dick Cheney for stem cell  funding.
? As you know, from our many mailouts, this is  a hot topic! We are very 
afraid that Pres Bush and VP Cheney might ban stem cell  research, thus 
negating all chances of our cure for diabetes.
? I hope that you can help Leah when she  calls. I have sung your praises to 
her (and just about everyone from Washington  to Timbucktu). Thanks, Mike.

Subject: Re: CATS litigation  

Mike,  it is going to take a long time for the frustration to subside from 
this one.  It would be one thing to lose fair and square.  It was quite 
another to simply be "mugged"  (the word used by Jonathan Sumption).  Even 
worse, Pollack (your old friend) was overheard to say that it was a joke the 
way Enron got "stitched up".  Makes you feel a bit like you are in a kangaroo 
court.  One read of the opnion will bring tears to your eyes when they talk 
about "what the parties really intended" instead of what the contract says.  
The only route of appeal is to the Court of Human Rights (which right this 
minute I am feeling that mine have been violated) so it's a tough one.  
Anyway onward and upward to the broadband world (nothing's easy these days).  
Thank you for your words of comfort.  I must confess that in reality I am 
actually struggling to come to terms with this one (because we are right, of 
course), but in the end I must remember, this too shall pass.  Ciao.

I can't tell you how disturbed I was over this.  I can't imagine how you are

No way to take this to the EU?

Can you please arrange for this message to be sent to all of Enron - Houston 
this evening.  It should have Mike McConnell's letterhead and we would like 
an opportunity to preview the final message before it goes out.  Please 
contact me at X-36898 if you have any questions.  Thanks.  

Cathy Phillips


It is my sincere honor to once again lead the Enron team in this year's 
Juvenile Diabetes Foundation (JDF) walk scheduled to take place on Sunday, 
November 5, 2000, at the Sam Houston Race Park.  I continue to serve on the 
board of JDF representing Enron and will be Enron's corporate executive for 
this year's fundraising efforts.

As many of you may already know, I am an insulin dependent diabetic myself.  
Even though I know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the 
multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day, I cannot 
imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease.  Taking 
insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of 
complications; insulin is simply their life support system and without it 
they would die.

Enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for JDF again this year.  JDF 
is a very efficient organization in which approximately 84% of all money 
raised goes directly to research.  Enron's goal this year is to raise 
$225,000 and we need your help.  Enron has been the number 1 walk team for 5 
years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place!  We need team 
leaders, walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal.  The theme for the 
walk this year is "Knock Out Diabetes" and we would like to have you join us 
for this great event.  The Walk is truly a blast and we had about 500 Enron 
people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it.

If you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader, or if 
you would like to make a pledge, you may call any of the steering committee 
members listed below.  If you are interested in being a team leader, please 
contact one of the following people immediately so that you may be included 
in the first important and informative training session taking place this 
week.

Thank you very much for your support.

Jonny,

Howdy, I bet you had a great time at the game.  I did watch it and it never 
felt good and I am still amazed at the outcome.  Did it feel different 
actually being there?

Are you going Miami?  Mark and I may be in.  What about you?  I figured for 
sure that you are already making plans.  Also, do you think it will be 
impossible to get tickets?

We are in for spring break.  We will not be able to be there the entire week 
and we are looking at the exact dates and my schedule - but count us in.

If you get a chance why don't you give me a call and we can catch up.

Mike

PS - Enron stock was down $15/share, ouch.  No partiuclar reason mainlly huge 
sector movement.

Howdy,

Kansas City will be great.  Thanks for the invite but I can't go.  I pray
that the Nebr. Sooners show up,  not the Sooners of the last 3 weeks.  We
really look awful.  Early peak?

That's great news for spring break.  Let me talk to the boss and let her
know that is still and option and see if it still works.

Thanks,
Mike

Go Sooners.  Shame about Hipel, he has thrown away his Heisman over the
last couple of weeks.  Do you agree?

Speaking of great to be back... we are heading to Kansas City on Saturday.
If O.U. plays in the National Title game we are going to try to go.  Any
interest? I can probably come up with some tickets.

Spring Break for us is also the 12th - 16th.  We have not made any other
plans.  Lets ski in Telluride.

Continental fly's direct from Houston to Montrose, but the flights book
pretty early.  I just checked and there are two flights per day and seats
are available. Let me know if you need help with your travel plans.  We
will
go up on Friday the 9th and return on Sunday the 18th so whatever schedule
you can make is great.  We will have you picked up at the airport, no
problem.

Jonny

Pelt,

Howdy from Houston.  I hope you had a great Thanksgiving.  I took the week
off and it was what i needed.  I have been working at a hectic pace and was
on my annual sick rotation, although a little earlier than normal.  I
needed the break.  My international traveling is over for the year, thank
God.

Chris and i were talking about life and vacations and spring break came up.
I thought i would send you our information and see if our breaks
co-ordinated and to see if we still wanted to try and get together to go
skiing.  We didn't know if you made other plans or moved on since our last
discussion a while ago.  Our spring break is March 12-16th .

Please let give an update via email when you get a chance.  I figured that
you are in Telluride right now on holiday.

Give my love to all.

Mike



PS - How about those Sooners!  OU/TX wasn't a fluke. Hard to believe, we'll
see what will happen with K State and bowls.  No matter, its been a fun
year.  It is nice to be back.

Now I know why God made lawyers!  Below is Kevin Liss' latest analysis.  His 
main thesis is that there is a huge return available to the company that will 
take the tax risk.  We just have to find that company.

Subject: The Way Forward

Dan, in response to your question yesterday, it should still be possible to 
get a structural ruling from the IRS along the lines that Deutschebank (DB) 
had contemplated.  In that respect, last week's IRS announcement leaves 
things unchanged.

That's the good news.  However, in light of last week's IRS announcement, DB 
is unlikely to be able to get the new ruling that they desired confirming 
Pacificorp's existing letter rulings, which they have told us was critical to 
them.  It would appear then that the Pacificorp deal is a non-starter from 
their perspective, at least based upon the present plan of operations.  Tim, 
is it at all possible that DB would be willing to drop their demand about 
going back for a confirming letter ruling as long as the Pacificorp 
facilities are processing at least some percentage of coal fines with their 
run-of-mine coal, consistently with their existing rulings?  I doubt it, but 
if not, we need to know so that we can move on and think about other ways to 
do a coal deal with Pacificorp.  I believe that Pacificorp still needs to 
unload their facilities, and they may still be able to leverage off of their 
existing rulings, which are still valid and have not been revoked by the IRS. 

Without a deal with DB, what are our options now?   

First, it is important to recognize that we still have options.  The IRS has 
not killed synfuel.  There has not been any change in the substantive law.  
Last week's announcement was just that -- an announcement of the IRS's point 
of view.  The news is that the IRS is getting out of the business of issuing 
private letter rulings to private taxpayers in the synfuel business, which 
has been an important source of comfort to many investors, but not 
necessarily vital.  Deals get done all the time without the benefit of having 
a private letter ruling from the IRS (generally in reliance on an opinion of 
outside counsel).  We just need to think in terms of what the landscape looks 
like in the absence of getting a new ruling.

One approach would be to follow through with our plans for Pacificorp's 
facilties, meaning we would relocate them, and continue running run-of-mine 
coal, the IRS be damned, and just find an equity player with a greater risk 
profile than Pacificorp.  In short, we would need companies who are willing 
to rely on Pacificorp's existing rulings, period (along with an appropriate 
indemnity).   It seems to me that if the price is right, someone ought to be 
willing to step up.   While the risk is now greater, the potential returns 
are potentially mind-blowing, and an equity player ought to be able to get an 
opinion of outside counsel vouching for the viability of the credits, 
notwithstanding the IRS' current view of the law.  It seems to me that this 
is the only approach that makes sense.

Alternatively, Pacificorp's facilities could revert back to being a pure coal 
fine processing facilities in an atttempt to conform with the IRS's recent 
announcement.  The IRS announcement implicitly endorses facilities that 
process "waste coal fines," so such facilities could still qualify for new 
private letter rulings.  The IRS announcement defines the term "waste coal 
fines" very vaguely, not specifying either the coal size, or what it is that 
makes coal fines properly viewed as "waste" coal fines.  If you think in 
lawyerly terms and try to deconstruct the literal language they use in their 
announcement, I can envision that Enron could synthetically create "waste" 
coal fines by rewriting some of our coal supply contracts with utility 
customers to provide for the sale of only coal of 3/4 inches or greater, 
resulting in a residual category of "unwanted" coal that we could separately 
market to synfuel plants as "waste" coal fines.  In other words, they could 
be fairly described as "waste" insofar as another coal customer specifically 
excluded it from their contract.  In addition, the IRS announcement does not 
require a waste coal fine processing facility to pelletize its output, as 
some commontators had feared, which is a helpful development because the 
pelletizing process would be a tremendous drag on capacity.  

However, there are real difficulties with this approach.  First, the relevant 
language in the IRS announcement defining "waste coal fines" is not real 
statutory law.  It is basically just an IRS policy statement, meaning that we 
cannot bind the IRS to it.  So the opportunity for gamesmanship over the 
IRS's choice of language is much more limited than it would be if this were 
statutory law.  Also, Price Manford has reported to me that what the IRS 
really has in mind in terms of what is acceptable to them as bonafide waste 
fines is fines from true waste ponds.  Even if the taxpayer can argue over 
the meaning of the term "waste" fines, the IRS can stick to their 
understanding of the term, at least for the sake of deciding whether to issue 
a new ruling.  In short, the IRS may not be willing to give a new ruling 
based on a coal fines facility that does not process the truly 3 or 4% waste 
fines incidental to mining operations.  If you are not going to be able to 
get a new ruling anyway, what's the point of going back to being a coal fine 
processing facility?

But there is another more fundamental problem to the latter approach.  
Pacificorp already has good private letter rulings that bless coal fines 
generally (i.e., not merely "waste" coal fines) as well as run-of-mine coal.  
Why would anyone want to go back to the IRS to get a new ruling that is more 
restrictive than the ones that they already have?  That is truly putting 
value at risk.  

In my view, the best deal for Pacificorp would be to market their existing 
rulings as essentially "above market" rulings, insofar as they go farther 
than the IRS currently allows, giving them a competitive advantage over other 
synfuel operators who never got a ruling.  It seems to me that if they can be 
persuaded to lower their price expectations in light of the new landscape, 
since a new equity player is going to have to bear real risk, then we may 
still have an opportunity to do a synfuel deal.

The project name was changed at the request of Corporate Development as they 
are concerned about discovery and a project name which could imply Enron 
stuffed EOTT.  The following is a current overview we are using to update the 
different disciplines involved with the transaction to date.  Our 
calculations continue to show a net $100MM benefit to EGM with 2Q $62MM due 
to Enron's current 38% economic ownership of EOTT.  No new updates to 
fastrack a sale of the GP.  

Regards,

-Larry-

Team, 

Another great meeting this month!  Thanks for your participation.

Please mark your calendar for our next Vision and Values meeting - Wednesday, 
August 16 from 9am until noon in eb 46c1.

Below summarizes the key points from our July 19 meeting:

Communications Training
Feedback from I&I continues to be positive.
The number of vp's and above not enrolled in Executive Impact and Influence 
increased to 111.  The increase is the result of cancellations.  
We had a discussion about what the "quantifiable penalty" would be for vp's 
and above who DID NOT participate in the Executive Impact and Influence 
training.  I continue to research this issue.  I hope to have an update at 
our next meeting on August 16.
Work continues on the development on Executive Impact and Influence II.  The 
design of this one-day training session is slated to be completed by the end 
of August.  The plan is to conduct the first training session by the end of 
September.  P&D training will be included in the course curriculum. 
Development of the on-line communications course continues working with 
Cognitive Arts with a target completion of year end.  V&V Task Force members 
will receive a call from Cognitive Arts to provide input into the design of 
the course. 

Communication Tools
The updated PeopleFinder and ExpertFinder are on schedule.  PeopleFinder 
should be available at the end of July and ExpertFinder should be available 
by mid-September.

P&D 
Work continues to roll P&D out in the new Enron tool, ThinkBank.  Initial map 
sites for drop down content on the P&D flowchart are being developed.
Facilitators are currently being identified throughout the organization.
We need all V&V Task Force members to communicate with their business units 
about using this tool when appropriate.

Communication Campaign
Additional products continue to be distributed throughout the Houston Enron 
building with interesting Enron facts.  
Targeted international offices received their Vision and Values posters.

Diversity
Dick Liebert reported that questions for the ETC survey are currently being 
developed.
Three additional Diversity Focus Groups are being held to include the 
perspective of commercial employees.
A meeting of the entire Diversity Task Force is scheduled for Sept. 26.

Best Companies Survey
Mary Clark and team completed Enron's application and forwarded it to Fortune 
on July 25.  Keep your fingers crossed!

That covers the high points of the meeting.  Please let me know if you have 
additional information to share with the group.  Beth and I will see you 
August 16.

Gina

I've forward separate e-mails to each of you initiating both my interest to 
introduce myself for consideration to working within your respective groups, 
but also including some commercial ideas relative to the South American 
region and elsewhere.  

I would ask at your convenience for confirmation of your interest, or not, 
and availability for meetings during the week of Oct 16th-20 in Houston.   

I am available, in the meantime, to respond to any information you need, 
including clarifying any of my experience at or prior to Enron.

Thank you in advance for any effort extended in my behalf.

Shanna,

What a deal.  When Jonathan and I talked, he did ask if this deal with Net 
Works was a problem.  I told him that I wouldn't imagine it would be an issue 
but to work it out with Eric and i gave him yours and Cindy's name rather 
than Robert.  Is this out of line with others at his level and responsiblity?

I have had some discussions with Jonathan and recommended he takes the LNG 
job offered.  Assuming he does, we have already set out the terms for him 
coming over (fully negotiated) so there is nothing to do on the HR side 
provided you are happy with the numbers.

Louise

ps Robert please send Jeff the Jonathan numbers.

Mark,

FYI, here is the latest update on our Q4.  We are making headway and the list 
shows how we intend to make up the short fall.  As I stated on my voicemail 
yesterday, upon our return from the holiday,  I will be even more proactively 
managing the Q4 P&L.

Atached, per your request, are my proposed "top three objectives" for 2001 
for both LNG and Middle East.  Note that I have also listed separately some 
of the other important stuff that we are trying to get done this year.

With regard to LNG, when I look at  what we are trying to get done this year, 
it leads me to conclude that we still have not come to grips with what we 
need to do to really grow this business.  Therefore, I drafted another, more 
broad statement of what I believe we need to be doing to realize our LNG 
vision.  I believe that this is critical and that we have not yet confronted 
the reality as to what we need to be doing.  I am anxious to discuss this 
with you when we meet in London.

Hi Nina -

It is highly doubtful that Mike will be available to attend the Art Committee 
meeting since his big 2001 budget meeting with Mr. Lay and Mr. Skilling will 
begin at 2:00 p.m. on that same day.

Can you do us a big favor and please also send the Art Committee messages to 
me.  When Mike is traveling it makes it much easier if I have been copied on 
messages that involve putting meetings on Mike calendar.

I hope all is going well for you.  Thanks so much.

I've forward separate e-mails to each of you initiating both my interest to 
introduce myself for consideration to working within your respective groups, 
but also including some commercial ideas relative to the South American 
region and elsewhere.  

I would ask at your convenience for confirmation of your interest, or not, 
and availability for meetings during the week of Oct 16th-20 in Houston.   

I am available, in the meantime, to respond to any information you need, 
including clarifying any of my experience at or prior to Enron.

Thank you in advance for any effort extended in my behalf.

Matt,

I did send on your email to 3 people at EBS:   Ken Rice, CEO; David Cox, MD; 
and Kevin Garland, VP of investments.  They are all out of the office thru 
next week.   If you don't hear back from someone in a couple of weeks, please 
let me know.

Thanks and good luck.  Say hello to my good friend Robin.

Rick,  

While in Tokyo, Sanjay grabbed Jeff and me regarding redoing and re-looking 
at the existing LNG fuel deals for Dabhol.  The bottom line is that he 
believes that the government may have issues on actually performing post 
phase 2 and if we could redo the LNG contracts and allow more flexibility we 
could help them, thus help ourselves.  We need to look into this and I would 
like your initial opinion.  This is complex to say the least and it would 
involve using the ship differently than scheduled and diverting some of the 
Oman LNG to other markets with their approval.  He believes that there is 
some flexibility in the shipping and Oman contracts to address these issues.  
If it works we could create a long physical condition and an extra ship for 
transport.  Is there an opportunity here if all the cards fall into place?

Lets discuss when I am in Dubai.  Sanjay is not going to let it go so you 
need to think about who can look into this further.

Mike

Greg,

I didn't realize you were doing that, that's great.  I am sure they need your 
help, so few people are willing to give back to their old collegiate  
experiences.  My thanks as a Sig Ep.  

I just changed jobs within Enron  (again) and have had a wild and difficult 
morning and your email made me chuckle.  I have done a few things at OU, and 
may be coming up in Sept. for a speech, and I'm not sure what pictures you 
are talking about.  The business school took some pictures and so did the 
Energy Management Program (the old PLM school) but I have not seen them nor 
do i know what they did with any they took.  If you are talking about a 
formal picture, I could provide one with my corporate bio if you need it for 
some reason. 

Thanks for the chuckle,
mike

PS:  I have been called a lot of things including "that God damned 
McConnell"  but that is as close as it gets.

Subject: Sig Ep stuff


Spot-I don't know if you know it or not, but a year ago I started serving as
Treasurer of the Sig Ep alumni board. It has been an interesting experience.
Some months back, it came to my attention that you have on occasion dropped
by the house. I am not sure what you said or did, but some of those actives
now think you are God. In fact, they put together a brochure that helped them
win the President's Trophy, signifying the best fraternity at OU, and
pictures of your visit were prominent in the brochure. We were kind of hoping
that some more copies could be printed, but I am not sure where we stand.
Just the same, I thought you would get a kick out of knowing that some of
these guys are now getting down on their knees and saying their nightly
prayers to you. It has created a bit of a problem in the pledgeship program.
If you recall, many of the fraternity's principles were based on God, and
some of the pledges seem to think Carter Ashton Jenkins was referring to you.
I think with some hard work, this will not be an insurmountable problem,
however.

HFF,

Greg

I want to take a moment to thank each of you for having a summer Analyst or 
Associate work on your team. I also want to remind everyone what a high 
stakes activity this is for Enron.
Based on your recommendation, we will make offers at the end of the summer to 
those interns who perform, and who you endorse as a potential future member 
of your team. Those interns who have had a good experience and accept our 
offer will be the lowest risk hires we make - from any source. We will have 
effectively interviewed and watched them work for 2-3 months. They also have 
the potential to be the most effective advocates and talent scouts we have, 
when they return to campus. On the flip side, those who don't have meaningful 
assignments, or have bad experiences during the summer can severely hurt our 
efforts.
Thank you again for being part of this very important activity. If you have 
any questions, or if areas of concern arise during the summer, please contact 
Ted Bland (x35275), Traci Warner (x33242) or me (x36671).
We appreciate your contributions to this important effort for Enron. 
Billy

FYI---it looks like CMS and Enron are the two shortlisted companies for the 
SADAF power/steam opportunity in Eastern Saudi Arabia.  You may recall taht 
this opportunity could give a good base line income with upsides for energy 
management services in a huge petrochemical comples in Eastern Saudi. 

We will be receiving clarification questionnaires from SADAF and will meet 
with them in the near future.

John,

Attached for your review is a resume for Trevor Woods.  He worked for me in 2 
areas,  including directly for me in Technology.  He is outstanding and left 
enron to join his brother in law in a start up out in San Francisco.  He was 
an associate at the time.  He is interested in coming back and is talking 
with many areas of enron for positions.  His girlfriend, Julie Ferrara, is in 
Net Works and may becoming to London as an assignment.  If she does, he would 
really like to come as well - if it is possible.  I didn't know if you have a 
need but he is great and would make an excellent Jr. commercial guy in an 
origination type of role.  

I wanted you to have shot at him as well.

Mike

Below is a quick follow up to some of the things I mentioned I'd check out at 
our last meeting.  Please let me know how I can be of assistance with your 
efforts.

Contributions
The contributions from last year that I mentioned at the meeting turned out 
to be inclusive of Enron Corp., individual and matching funds.

Weather
I had a chance to talk with our folks from the Weather Group.  The 
information regarding Oklahoma that I told you I'd look into actually ended 
up being a center for Weather Research that was being sponsored by Williams 
not our weather group.

Scholarship
There are a couple of different scholarship and fundraising initiatives 
underway that are being driven by Enron employees and alumni of the 
individual universities employed here.  They take advantage of matching funds 
and are administered by employees here with some assistance by Community 
Relations and University Affairs.  If you are interested in organizing an 
effort like this for Oklahoma, let me know and I can work with you on the 
details.

Enron is a member of the Center on the Management of Information Technology
(COMIT) in the Jones Graduate School of Management at Rice University.
Alberto Gude was the Enron representative for COMIT. Alberto indicated that
I should contact you concerning COMIT activities.

On July 18 from 9:30 until about noon, we will have the COMIT planning
meeting to determine activities for the next academic year. Please place
this date on your calendar. I'll be sending additional information at a
later date.

If you are not able to attend the meeting, I will appreciate you sending a
representative.

In the future, is there one individual I should contact rather than the two
of you?

I look forward to working with you.

Dan,

Thanks for the email and quick response.  I am in the process of discussing 
this with various people.  A couple of observations that have become clear 
and  I want to pass them on to you.  Overall, the size of the transaction is 
not going to fly.  If we brought in other players and significantly reduced 
our exposure and the other players validated the technology and overall play, 
it would increase the odds that we are interested in this type of deal.  Rick 
Buy stated firmly that Jeff will not be interested in taking this type of 
deal to the board especially with what just happened with Ecogas and Kafus.

I called George last night and touched on these topics but they have been 
reconfirmed this morning.  I understand that the deal is very active and 
needs to move forward now, but I think we should inform Pacificorp that we 
will not take the entire deal.  Last night George stated that he may not want 
to tell them that and I agreed.  But upon reflection, I think that needs to 
be re-addressed.  The original deal size is DOA and if I really believe that, 
then not passing that information could hurt us in getting any size deal 
potentially closed with these guys.  Also having them assist in bringing 
others to the table might be beneficial.

I'll keep you informed as i move forward and learn more.

Mike

Subject: draft

Mike and Jeff:

Attached is a copy of the Pacificorp presentation from last week.  To 
reiterate, the key commercial risk issues are:

1)  Tax--Jordan Mintz has a high degree of confidence regarding the 
qualifications of the Pacificorp machines.  Thorough due dilligence will be 
required to investigate the representations made in the private letter ruling 
applications.

2)  Syndication--Joe Deffner and Tim Proffitt are working to find 
monetizers.  Ideally, the monetizers would close when we do.  Realistically, 
we have to assume that we will bridge the deal and wear equity risk until we 
can shed our ownership.  Pacificorp has expressed an interest in staying in 
as 25% owner, which should reduce the bridge risk, since we can show the 
former owner staying in the game.

3)  Operations--The risk of operations will lie with the holders of the 
equity.  Post-syndication, the new owners can contract directly with an 
operator.  For tax purposes the owner needs to have some risk.  We will guide 
the monetizers to this risk.  If we have to indemnify them in this area, we 
will need to better understand the available insurance products.
4)  Marketing--This is the risk the coal desk is trying to acquire.  The desk 
believes that the coal/synfuel spread risk will decrease dramatically over 
the next 12-18 months.  We have put $6.00/ton into the model, and the desk 
will buy $3.00/ton today for seven years.  The current market is anywhere 
from $1.00-3.00/ton.  We have also developed a list of strong sites that are 
looking for machines, three of which we control, either through options or 
marketing agreements.

The economics of the deal are compelling.  We put out $100mm to Pacificorp as 
an equity bridge (maybe less if they stay in as 25% owner).  We collect 
$30-50mm in commodity spread origination, and another $30-50mm in equity 
origination.

Commercially, the deal makes sense, and I am confident that we can structure 
around the risks.  The decision we need from senior management is whether 
this is a game we want to play.  The machines fit into the letter of the 
law.  Big companies (AIG, Florida Progress, Detroit Edison, etc.) have joined 
in the reindeer games.  We can put on the position we want by bridging this 
deal.

On the flip side, people have heartburn over "spirit of the law" issues and 
those are questions that senior management has to decide.   We have a chance 
to move on these machines, but need to make up our mind by the end of this 
week whether to put resources on it.  We can back out later (our commitment 
so far is non-binding), but we can't get back in.

Please let me know your thoughts.

Regards,

Dan

Matt - awesome!!

Excellent job on hitting 100 EOL trades today.  This is especially 
significant given the fact that the OTC market only handled 10 trades today ( 
and we even participated in 4 of those).  Who woulda thunk!

Keep going,

George

Erin, here are a couple of responses.  Please rewrite as you see fit.  
Mike

1. Agriculture.    We are currently looking at and studying the industry.  We 
have traded some commodities as well.  We believe that there may be large 
opportunities to apply the Enron model to the agriculture industry.  We have 
spent quite a bit of time an effort and are currently developing our 
strategy.  This is very early in development but we have high expectations in 
this area.  I don't feel comfortable going into more detail at this time.  
Gary Hickerson is responsible Enron's ag business.

2.  Rail.  We are looking at numerous opportunities in the rail and 
transportation businesses.  I haven't seen a lot on the electricity piece of 
rail.  It is an interesting concept and one that we will look at.   Dan Reck 
is now responsible for looking at transportation opportunities in the US.

As Mike and I look across all of our business units, we continue to look for 
optimal organizational structures that will enable each business unit to 
achieve it's targets for  2001 and beyond.  In our weather business, there 
appears to be a lack of seamlessness.  Reporting relationships, P&L, and 
vision for this business are not best aligned as this business exists today.  

Mike and I would like to address this as follows:    we need 100% full time 
dedication from each and any employee that is dedicated to the weather 
business.  All identified employees in the weather business will now become 
full time employees of EGM and report to Mark Tawney. Accordingly Mark and I 
will be looking at, with each of you, the employees that may be affected by 
this transition and the need to hire additional employees.  It is important 
that both business units work together to determine which individuals will be 
in Weather, or  will be in EEL.  Once done, Mark will begin adding to the 
weather team in each of your regions.   It is obvious that the organizations 
and product lines can lever each other and the synergy's will provide 
powerful results in our regional gas and power businesses in particular.  

If you look at coal, lng, equities, etc, we have employees based in each of 
your regions who report back into the appropriate business unit within EGM.  
This restructure will similarly align weather.  

Please give me a call and we will discuss the issues surrounding this new 
structure.

Subject: Media Interview - Oxy/Saudi Gas Projects

We just were informed that as per request of their CEO, Occidental has 
scheduled a media interview with Reuters (in approximately one hour), 
publicizing that the company has been short listed and signed a letter of 
intent to participate in Saudi Arabia's recent energy initiative.  John has 
asked me to forward Oxy's planned statement as well as our planned response 
to possible media inquiries resulting from this (see attachments).  He does 
not anticipate any problems with the document and he recommends that we 
should allow Oxy to include Enron in the statement.  I received legal 
approval on both statements and we are currently securing approval from 
Global Markets.

Katrina,
> This is what I would propose saying to the media:
>
> "Occidental is pleased to have made the short list of companies invited to
> submit letters of intent to develop the Kingdom's natural gas reserves.
> Occidental has been invited to submit proposals of 2 of the 3 ventures
> approved by the government.  Occidental (and our partner Enron) have
> signed a letters of intent and submitted them to the Kingdom.  The
> government of the Kingdom is to be commended for the exceptionally
> professional manner in which they have managed this process and the many
> courtesies they have extended the participants.  The government has laid a
> strong foundation for the development an excellent working relationship
> with private foreign investors in the energy sector who will be working in
> partnership with the Kingdom in future years."
>
> Larry Meriage

In the event we will receive any media inquires related to this matter, I 
have prepared the following statement:

"We can confirm that in partnership with Occidental,  we have been short 
listed and we have signed a letter of intent to pursue future gas 
opportunities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.  We are pleased to have the 
opportunity to work with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia; however, it would be 
inappropriate for us to comment further at this time."

I apologize for the short time frame, but please let me know if you have any 
objections or concerns regarding this matter.  Thanks.

Guys,

I had an interview with a reporter from the Economist yesterday.  He is doing 
a big story on business changes, online changes, Jeff Skilling and Enron. 
Coal came up a lot and i described my enthusiasm for our coal business and 
our growth.  He wants to put some focus on the coal business and i need some 
facts to get back to him.

What percentage of our coal transactions or business is online?
Speed changes on a typical transaction post and pre online?
Other changes you see or products to develop
International effects
Total coal moved (physical and financial) especially online
Other competing exchanges and why ours is better
Other proEnron facts that illustrate our growing business especially as it 
relates to paradigm changes or online changes

Please feed me this info and if there is something specific that you don't 
want me to say let me know that too but go ahead and give me the answer.  I 
need this information pretty quickly.

Thanks,
m

Thanks for the email.  I do have a question.  I am talking with these folks 
because of your personal reference but how does this work with Project 
Summer.  Although we don't talk about this, I have heard (not first hand) 
that there will not be an opportunity for people transfer because of the 
deal.  I don't want to waste anyone's time if this is just an exercise  What 
is the scoop?

Mike - As a followup to my voicemail, I am forwarding the resume of Rafi 
Khan.  I have worked directly with Rafi previously and have a very high 
regard for him.  Currently is Enron's Middle East/LNG group, Rafi's 
experience spans tax structuring, financial analysis, risk management and 
deal structuring and origination.  He also has completed his law degree.  
Rafi is seeking a Houston-based opportunity and, with his global finance and 
commercial experience, would be a strong candidate for a position in your new

as per has mentioned to you, there have been a number o factors working 
against us recently in obtaining insurance for the book.

i was expecting to have a positive response by tomorrow, but the person 
responsible had a baby on saturday, so this may be delayed until later in the 
week. (i had my computer with me in the delivery room for our first child, so 
its possible, (but i didnt for the second)).

one unexpected factor is that aquila has signed exclusive arrangements with 
some of the insurers who could have backed us.  these agreements prevent them 
from doing business with us.

another primary market, ace, is still pissed at me for leaving and going to 
enron, whom they consider a serious threat to their franchise.  this was 
somewhat expected, and i am already starting the groveling process to get 
them to transact with us.

another unexpected situation is the supply/demand imbalance.  given the fact 
that forced outage insurance policies have paid out no more than a few 
million in claims while collecting over $100 million in profits, the common 
wisdom in the insurance industry was that supply would increase and demand 
would decrease.  this year has surprised even me -- demand is as strong as 
ever and supply has not increased.  this is evidenced by the much higher 
margins we have collected on the few selected deals we have done.

we also got started too late in the season, so we did not have a sufficient 
portfolio to attract insurance partners earlier.  i tried to build the 
business too quickly from this position.

of course, my job is not to explain the reasons for things turning out 
differently from what we expected.  the current problem is that i need to 
hedge out our book in a difficult environment.

first, we agreed that we would take action on may 15 if we did not obtain 
reinsurance by that date.  i have halted origination activity in this area, 
which will result in the loss of ~75% of our business.  we are currently in 
final negotiations on 4 transactions, which will then make up our final 
portfolio for this year.  these are among the most profitable deals we have 
seen this year and should be the easiest to hedge.  this will leave us with 
$15 million in revenue and $250 million in total theoretical exposure (P99 = 
$30 million).

second, we agreed that we would not be sitting on a "high gamma" risk going 
into june.  i am still hoping that we get the insurance offer next week, but 
if it is not in place by june 1, we will hedge the book in the underlying 
commodity to gain time for placing the insurance.
this should buy us 2-3 more weeks to finalize the strategy without sitting on 
significant risk.
  
this may also be the best time to talk about our newest hedging strategy.  
when backed into a corner, and deprived of sleep (and food), i usually come 
up with my best business ideas.  since ive had little of either for the past 
2 months, i have been working with alex and larry to develop a generalized 
hedging theory for outage risk.  without going into much detail here, the 
idea is that there is a first derivative with respect to MW (i'm currently 
calling it omega (w = watt)), which is comparable to the delta and gamma 
hedging greeks.  on a single unit, this has no value, but for a portfolio, 
you can compute this omega and apply a combination of static and dynamic 
hedges to equalize your option position, much in the same way the 
black-scholes formula hedges an option with respect to changes in the 
underlying commodity.  for example, when you experience a single outage on 
the system, you increase your position so that you are prepared for the next 
outage.  our preliminary thoughts on this are that it can manage the tail 
risk of a portfolio as well, if not better, than insurance.  the other 
benefit of this approach is that it is much more consistent with the theory 
used by all other traded books to manage risk.  it may also create an entire 
new way of pricing unit-contingent power based on the hedging cost (just like 
B-S is used to value options).  i'm not suggesting that this solves all of 
our problems in the short term, but this development will be significant in 
power trading.  i am working with tim belden this week to apply this theory 
to the massive pacificorp deal, because it is the only way to effectively 
manage that risk.  the total hedging cost using this approach should be less 
than $30 million, compared to the offered premium of $140m.

we can talk about this on thursday, then i'd like to discuss with vince & 
vasant to get their thoughts.

Virginia, 

Thanks for the update.  I will not have an opportunity to talk with you right 
now.  I am in Tokyo and my next destination may change due to business events 
in the middle east.

I am very interested in acquiring Blue note, however,  I do want to know more 
about the price.  I was close to locating one via a gallery via ebay for a 
lot less.  Also, your price was $4,500 for the same piece framed.  Is there 
room on the price if I give you a firm commitment.  The ebay price is 
significantly discounted but they are not ready to close the deal yet 
either.  If you can't get them down on the price,  it is worth me chasing 
down the other option for a while.

Please let me know via email and I will attempt to be responsive via odd time 
zones.

Thanks,
mike

Dear Mike:

Glad to hear from you.

The Lichtenstein "Composition No. 4" is exactly like the one you saw except
that it would be a different number in the signed and numbered edition.  The
price is $4,500.00.  That is unframed.  We can frame the artwork like the
Liechtenstein you saw here or if you prefer like the Matisse.  You have that
option.

I will contact the owner and send you an image either by e-mail or by mail.
The window of opportunity to acquire the artwork is limited.

I would love to talk to you personally about the Matisse "Icarus" artwork.
When would be the best time to contact you and Chris?

As I mentioned to you this artwork is hard to find and cannot be easily
replaced.  Please keep in mind that several of our consultants are working
with clients and galleries to place this artwork.  I mention this only to
encourage to contact me if you have serious interest in adding this artwork to
your collection.

I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow.

Most sincerely,

Virginia Repasky

Subject: CATS litigation

Disappointingly, the House of Lords ruled 5 - 0 against Enron in the CATS 
litigation today.  This will mean that we will repay to the CATS parties 
approximately $150 million plus interest and court costs, putting the final 
figure at an estimated $155-160 million.  We expect to be invoiced for the 
principal amount in the next week or so; sorting costs and interest may take 
as long as 60 days.  The written opinion reflects a determination on the part 
of the Lords to rule against us regardless of what the contract says.  The 
opinion seeks to conclude "what rational businessmen could have intended" 
rather than applying the provisions of the contract.  

For example, Lord Hoffman (author of the primary opinion) makes it clear that 
the  "retrospective consequences" of discovering a latent defect after 
payments have been made (and would therefore need to be refunded) are 
unacceptable.  His view seems to be that because we were not ready to flow 
J-Block gas during the period of the T-6 leak, we are not damaged and 
therefore not entitled to relief under the contract.  Furthermore, he says 
that the Commencement Date notice sent by the CATS parties was in the nature 
of a declaration and as long as it is sent in good faith it is effective.

As far as the price reduction formula in Clause 7.5, Lord Hoffman opines that 
the clause is not operative until TGTL had tied in the J-Block field.  The 
contract makes no reference to this requirement.  Hoffman's view is that it 
is only upon tie-in that the CATS parties' obligation to provide the 
Transportation Service is triggered and therefore there can be no price 
reduction for not providing the service unless tie-in is complete. This 
statement is in stark contrast with Hoffman's earlier statement in the 
opinion that upon the giving of the Commencement Date notice the CATS parties 
have an absolute obligation to provide the Transportation Service.

Equally disappointing and surprising is the fact that the Lords rejected our 
submission for reimbursement of our costs incurred in connection with the 
restitution issue.  As you may recall, restitution was the primary issue upon 
which the CATS parties obtained leave to appeal, and they conceded the point 
at the commencement of the hearing.  Reimbursement of these costs should have 
been a given. 

Although I have not yet been able to speak to our most senior barrister, our 
other counsel have assessed the opinion as "appalling" and "pathetic," and 
describe the situation as one where Enron has been "stitched up".  
Unfortunately, given that this is the court of last resort in this country 
(except of course the Court of Human Rights), there is not an avenue for 
recourse.

In conclusion may I say that although we did not get the result we wanted or 
expected from the House of Lords, I very much appreciate all the support from 
each of you for these past six years.  The case has been a roller coaster 
ride;  I hope our earlier victory in the Court of Appeal will evidence in 
fact that some tribunals in this country recognize that we did get it right. 

Please call me if you wish to discuss the case in any further detail, or if 
you wish to have a copy of the opinion.  My telephone number is 011 44 207 
783 6582.  Many thanks.

 August EOL EmissionsTrades exceeded projections and posted another record 
trade month. We continue to show signs of strong trade growth and gaining 
market share. I am hopeful that Arizona Public Service & Conectiv will use 
the system more heavily in the future (hedge option trades) and that we can 
obtain at least one new counterparty a month vis-.-vis EOL marketing/and or 
our own internal marketing.  Our gain in market share has not gone 
unchallenged. Bloombergs Powermatch system has been more active in the last 
month and bid/ask spreads continue to narrow. To combat this we continue to 
show (90% of the time) the tightest markets and obviously offer a cost 
advantage over the Broker market & Bloomberg.   The increase in EOL volume 
has increased liquidity in the whole market.  I am hopeful that overall 
market volumes continue to grow as we get closer to compliance.


Number of Trades: 77
Number of Allowances: 192,500
Approx. Notional Trade Value: $28,875,000

Mr. McConnell,

I received a call tonight from Elliott Katz in our Sydney office regarding 
the problems that you were having with connectivity. I spoke to the 
technician in Tokyo and we were able to get everything working.

I tested your account via IPass to the Tokyo number  (011813) 3525 3000 and 
through the VPN client - both worked fine. Nobu and I stepped through making 
sure your system was connecting properly and that Notes was operational.

Neither of us had your password so I changed it to change12me. I will handle 
getting the password reset to whatever you would like if you would like to 
email or call me with it. The only catch is that it must be unique.

You can reach me on my cell phone anytime. The number is 713.539.3814.

Thank you and I hope you have a good visit and a safe trip home!

Travis Williams

Just received return phone call from Ito van Lanshot at Reliant.  I 
referenced earlier telecon between Bob Harvey and Mike McConell regarding 
possibilities on coal side.  Ito mentioned that he has an on-going dialog 
with John Sherriff regarding joint opportunities.  I explained nature of 
delivered coal deals we are doing in UK/Germany/Spain and expressed interest 
in similar arrangement in ARA ports - mentioned I had on-going dialog with 
Peter Davies.  He responded that they are evaluating continuing relationship 
with GKE on and on-going basis.  He would be interested in hearing more about 
nature of deals we are doing - he will get update from Peter Davies on status 
of GKE relationship and then would like to schedule a meeting in either 
London or Amsterdam to discuss possibilities.  Said he would touch base with 
John Sherriff (or directly with me) during the next 2 weeks.

Will keep everyone posted.

Ahmad,

Thank you for the email.  I enjoyed our visit very much.  I wanted to thank 
you for taking the time especially during your weekend to spend time away 
from your family.  I learned a lot during the trip and I believe in the 
Dolphin project.  I also liked many other of the project Rick's team has put 
together in the Middle East.

I promised you some of the speeches that I have delivered and attached below 
are 3 different ones that illustrate Enron's view of the future.

Thanks again.

Mike

Shanna,
I'm supportive of the raise to $150k.  I think he is doing a good job and has 
a lot of value.  He didn't fair well during the ranking due to lack of big $ 
or closure but maybe this will send him a good message.

Thanks,

Subject: Suggestion of Trading Gasoline on EnronOnline

Mr. Skilling,

We are a group of EE&CC engineers and we have an idea about trading gasoline 
online. 

Enron can trade gasoline as a commodity the same as natural gas and 
electricity.  The idea is any one can buy an amount of gasoline at a 
pre-determined price with a certain premium for an extended period.  Which 
means there is an expiration date for the investor or buyer.  

When the gasoline price is low, such as last year, people are able to buy a 
certain amount of gasoline from Enron,( Enron is to negotiate with gasoline 
producer for an amount and certain price (whole sale) that Enron believes 
they can sold in a certain period of time through market study and be able to 
make the profit), say  3000 gallons regular unleaded and with 10% (the profit 
margin to be determined  by Enron) premium.  The buyer will receive a debit 
or credit card to be used to purchase the gasoline and  the amount will be 
automatically recorded  each time when they fill up the cars until the amount 
of pre-purchased gasoline is used up in that period of time (prior to the 
expiration date).  The buyers (or customer) can also sell the unused gasoline 
back to Enron anytime before the expiration day the same price they bought 
from Enron for profit if the market gas price is lower or take a loss if the 
market price is higher.   By doing this, Enron creates a market that can 
allow customers to short the gasoline when the market is high.  

There are many other ways to trade the gasoline. Nevertheless, the potential 
market ( if a minimum of 50% household can sign up) is tremendous.  I 
sincerely believe that Enron has the capability to make it happen through 
existing Enron online e-business. We hope this idea has not been thought out 
before for its feasibility.

Dear Mr. Lay:

Because you were recognized Business Week in 1999  for "taking Enron into
the red-hot communications industry" by "developing an intelligent network
platform to facilitate online business and building a market for trading
bandwidth", we'd like to get your opinion on how we can contribute to your
initiative.

TBD Networks is a Secure VPN Management software company here in Silicon
Valley. We believe Enron could benefit from using our highly scalable
software to manage VPNs Enterprise-wide by:

1) Speeding up the setup and provisioning time for tens of thousands of
VPNs.
2) Uniquely Vendor-Independent: Supporting all types of VPNs (Remote
Access/Site-to-site/Extranet), based on equipment, products and technologies
from Cisco IOS, PIX, Altiga, Nortel and Check Point.
3) Reducing training and support needs by using our easy-to-use, web-based
GUI based on high-level policies, hiding low-level, vendor-specific
interfaces.
4) Providing significantly higher levels of security and control VPNs via
advanced features such as random policy auditing and proactive service
monitoring.

We would be very interested in meeting with someone at Enron to find out how
you would like to proceed. Who would you suggest we contact?

Sincerely,
Simon Stokes
Director of Sales

Congratulations, who would have predicted this when you got called back from

Mike/Jeff,

Just received confirmation from Enron Europe that they accepted the July 1 
transfer for Enron Japan P&L.  The Oslo weather move to EE has also been 
completed.

Tom,
I am fine with this but our effective date is a call of fairness that depends 
on your view of the middle east adjustment.  I don't want to be hard on this 
and get back a bigger number on middle east by default.  Its up to you and 
your judgement on what you think is appropriate and or a trade with Europe.  
I am fine with your ultimate decision.

Mike,

Attached is the proposed plan transfer to EGM for Enron Japan.  These amounts 
have been reviewed and approved by Joe Hirl.  We are still working with Enron 
Europe to gain agreement on the effective date (April 1 or July 1)  - will 
let you know as soon as this is settled.

Here's a summary of the Plan Amounts;


			 Split after 2Q 
			
			 EGM 
Margin*	1Q		                 -   
	2Q		                 -   
	3Q		      3,750,000 
	4Q		      3,750,000 
	2001		      7,500,000 
			
			
Expense	1Q		                 -   
	2Q		                 -   
	3Q		      3,366,377 
	4Q		      3,366,377 
	2001		      6,732,754 
			
			
EBIT	1Q		                 -   
	2Q		                 -   
	3Q		         383,623 
	4Q		         383,623 
	2001		         767,246 


If we end up with an April 1 transfer, EGM will be kept whole on plan (will 
be approx $3.4 MM expense, zero margin).

Please advise if you have any questions or wish to discuss this in further 
detail.

		 Subject: Other Aspects of Cheney Energy Report Recommendations of Interest 
to Enron -- Coal and Enviro Related

Below is the text of recommendations taken from the summary of 
recommendations in the Cheney Energy Report being released later this morning 
that focus on coal and coal-related issues, including environmental.

"The NEPD Group (National Energy Policy Development) recommends that the 
President direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) to propose multi-pollutant legislation.  The NEPD Group recommends that 
the President  direct the EPA Administrator to work with Congress to propose 
legislation that would establish a flexible, market-based program to 
significantly reduce and cap emissions fo sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, 
and mercury from electric power generators.  Such a program (with appropriate 
measures to address local concerns) would provide significant public health 
benefits even as we increase electricity supplies.

 Establish mandatory reduction targets to emissions of three main pollutants: 
sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury.

 Phase in reductions over a reasonable period of time, similar to the 
successful acid rain reduction program established by the 1990 amendments to
 the Clean Air Act.

 Provide regulatory certainty to allow utilities to make modifications to 
their plants without fear of new litigation.

 Provide market-based incentives, such as emissions trading credits to help 
achieve the required reductions."

"The NEPD Group recognizes the importance of looking to technology to help us 
meet the goals of increasing electricity generation while protecting our 
environment.  To that end, the NEPD Group  recommends that the President 
direct the Department of Energy to continue to develop advanced clean coal 
technology by:

 Investing $2 billion over 10 years to fund research in clean coal 
technologies.

 Supporting a permanent extension of the existing research and development 
tax credit.

 Directing federal agencies to explore regulatory approaches that will 
encourage advancements in environmental technology.

"The NEPD Group recomemnds that the President direct federal agencies to 
provide greater regulatory certainty relating to coal electricity generation 
through clear policies that are easily applied to business decisions."

"The NEPD Group recommends that the President direct the Administrator of the 
Environmental Protection Agency, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy 
and other relevant agencies, to review New Source Review regulations, 
including administrative interpretations and implementation, and report to 
the President within 90 days on the impact of the regulations on investment 
in new utility and refinery generation capacity, energy efficiency, and 
environmental protection."

"The NEPD Group recommends that the President direct the Attorney General to 
review existing enforcement actions regarding New Source Review to ensure 
that the enforcement actions are consistent with the Clean Air Act and its 
regulations."

"The NEPD Group recommends that the President direct federal agencies to 
support continued research into global climate change; continue efforts to 
identify environmentally and cost-effective ways to use market mechanisms and 
incentives; continue development of new technologies; and cooperate with 
allies, including through international processes, to develop technologies, 
market-based incentives, and other innovative approaches to address the issue 
of global climate change.

Rick, here is the proposed email on George.  Any comments?  I wanted to keep 
it short and sweet.  This will be sent out at close of business today (they 
like to send out massive emails after hours).

Pleaes let me know any issues or comments ASAP.

Thanks,

draft

Effective immediately, reporting responsibility for Global Strategic Sourcing 
("GSS") will move from Enron Net Works to Enron Corp.  George Wasaff, 
managing director, will report directly to Rick Causey, executive vice 
president and chief accounting officer for Enron.  GSS, formed February 1, 
2000, will continue to focus on supply-chain management world-wide for 
Enron.   We believe this change in reporting will leverage and enhance GSS's 
global reach and effectiveness while allowing ENW to focus on its core 
mission of creating new electronic market places.

Subject: Bush Meeting with Venezuala

Mike and Eric -- I have checked with the DC office (as well as Steve Kean and 
Rick Shapiro), and we're unable to confirm that a meeting will take place 
between Bush and Chavez.   As  you can see from the note below, Tom Briggs 
suspects that the confusion stems from Bush's scheduled participation in the 
upcoming Trade Summit.   Also, Bush is scheduled to meet with Fox later this 
week.   

I will work with Tom and others in the DC office to ensure that our Venezuela 
project -- and other LNG projects -- get the appropriate attention and 
support from the Administration.    In that regard, we will provide talking 
points to the relevant administration officials travelling with the President 
to the FTAA meeting.   I will work with the commercial LNG counterparts to 
get the necessary background details.

Please let me know if you would like to discuss.

Lisa

My contacts have not been able to confirm that a meeting will take place 
between Bush and Chavez.  They suspect the confusion stems from Bush's 
scheduled participation in the Summitt of the Americas to be held April 20-22 
in Quebec.  The Summit may address the FTAA (Free Trade Agreement of the 
Americas) and will provide an excellent opportunity  to raise LNG issues. 

Enron is putting together a hit list of issues that we should raise at this 
meeting and we should add LNG, especially given th eimposrtance of LNG to the 
US gas supply position.

As I wander the halls of Congress talking about energy, it would be very 
useful to have talking points on our LNG projects and the overall prospects 
for LNG imports.  I do not want confidential information, but it would be 
great if I cann state that LNG imposrts would be less than current spot 
prices.  Can you put together some talking points for me please?

Jeff,
I called Joe this morning and left him a pre-email voicemail on this.  I 
referenced the power of 100% focus and the accountability for someone driving 
the earnings and his pressure to make earnings in trading and electricity. 

I like your email and tone.  I would like to recommend you add a statement 
about Morten being very strong and that we aren't attempting to "own" him vs. 
having a 100%  dedicated weather guy.  I would also add that you want to talk 
him about this and how we could move quickly to complete our global vision 
with tawney.

MIke

As Mike and I look across all of our business units, we continue to look for 
optimal organizational structures that will enable each business unit to 
achieve it's targets for  2001 and beyond.  In our weather business, there 
appears to be a lack of seamlessness.  Reporting relationships, P&L, and 
vision for this business are not best alligned as this business exists 
today.  

Mike and I would like to address this as follows:  all employees in the 
weather business will now become full time employees of EGM and report to 
Mark Tawney.  We need 100% full time dedication from each of these employees 
in the weather business.  It is obvious that the organizations and product 
lines can lever each other and the synergies will provide powerful results in 
our regional gas and power businesses in particular.  

If you look at coal, lng, equities, etc, we have employees based in each of 
your regions who report back into the appropriate business unit within EGM.  
This restructure will similarly align weather.

Elise,

Thanks for the email.  In August i changed jobs and am now the CEO for Enron 
Global Markets.  I am no longer in the technology sector (although I enjoyed 
it very much and it was a difficult decision to leave).  Please remove me 
from your email list for further HTC events.

Thanks and good luck,

Ron, 

I hope you had a good week.  I've thought a lot about your family and you've 
been in my prayers.  

I apologize for the delay in this email but i decided not to bother you with 
this while you were away.  As a follow-up to our conversation, the authors 
that have had the biggest influence on me and along the lines we discussed 
are:

Dr. Denis Waitley (The Psychology of Winning, How to Build your child's 
self-esteem, many others but I can't remember the titles)
Dr. Norman Vincent Peale (The Power of Positive Thinking)
Og Mandino (The Choice, The mission)
Dr. Wayne Dyer (many)
Anthony Robbins (Unlimited Power, Personal Power, many others)

Attached are a couple of the outlines I did.  To my extremee frustration I 
can't find some of the others that i did many years ago.  I got a lot out of 
all of these, usually a little from each and when you least expect it.  I am 
a great believer in the old saying, "When the student is ready the teacher 
will come".

As we discussed, the results of all of the hundreds of books and tapes have 
had a profound effect on me and my family.  A few direct tangible results 
include:  my extensive long and short term goal setting, affirmation 
collection (over 100 pages and growing), my family journal (80 pages and 
growing) .....

When you get a chance and things settle down, please give me a call or I can 
definitely find time for lunch.

Mike

All,

Attached is some information on a guy that I just met with and is in 
re-deployment within Enron.  He is a finance guy by training, and has closed 
deals as an originator for EE&CC.  (He is not an EE&CC guy but was asked to 
go over there to help as an assignment)  Andy Fastow recommended that I see 
him.  I thought of your groups as a possible fit. 

He is out of redeployment on Friday and if you have an interest to talk to 
him I would lob in a quick call.

My schedule is generally free with the exception of Wednesday

Pup,

Howdy.   Back from the UK and Norway and am off for vacation to Boston and 
area for a wedding in Chris' family at lunch today.  There will be 65 Flynns 
there.  Hopefully it will be cooler.  

Update for Dallas.  Golf - tee time for 4 (I didn't know if anyone else would 
join us) at 1:28.  Spa - Brenda and Chris both have 1 1/2 hours massages at 
1:50 pm.  If Brenda wants anything else she can call the Four Seasons but at 
least they both have a spot.  I look forward to the weekend.  

This is the most prepared we will have ever been for the weekend.

Mike

Pelt,

We have made reservations for Fri. and Sat,  I didn't make yours but i
would move quickly.  Would you like me to set up a tee time and massages
for the girls?  I figured a 1 pm tee time?  Also what about tickets for the
game itself.  Will you have access as years gone by or does the search need
to begin?

We definitely are planning to go to Texas - O.U.  We are considering
staying
at the Four Seasons at Los Colinas.  Possibly a little golf and R & R mixed
in with the game.  It would be a bit out of the way.  We might go up as
early as Friday morning to play golf that afternoon.  Let me know what you
think.

Jonny,

Thank you so much for the email and kind words.  I was very moved by it and
you know I feel the same way.  I have become very reflective with the more
"success" that I have been fortunate enough to receive.  I am so thankful
and appreciative and although I have always been religious and spiritual,
it has grown more deeply.  I see so many people that have lost their
perspective and I pray that I will remain grounded and truly appreciate the
blessings that our family has received.  Chris and I often discuss how we
can help others and what can we do to really make a difference.

The Jones and the McConnells are truly very lucky.   Thanks, and give my
love to your family.

Mike


PS:  What about OU - Texas, do you have any ideas or plans already in the
works?

Sometimes we fail to stop and reflect on events which are of significance
because we are so busy with our heads down accomplishing the things we
strive for.  I hope you are taking a moment to reflect and enjoy the
incredible accomplishments which you have achieved at such a young age.
You
and I are two of the luckiest people in the world and must always remember
to give back what we have been so fortunate to receive.

Congratulations and keep up the good work.  I am proud to call you my
friend.


Jonny

you feel are necessary and appropriate.  It is set up for Thursday morning at

Jeff, 

FYI, I just got this from Tom.  We don't have a very big opportunity here!  
Tom did tell me that his numbers were going to be difficult to get.  Not that 
i don't want to put $5 trillion on our chart, but what do you think we should 
put as market size?  Nat gas, power and our existing verticals only?  What do 
you think?

He is the only one to give me a number yet.  I am going to discuss it at the 
staff meeting.

Mike

Mike,

We met back in the early summer and made a presentation to you, Steve Horn,
and Allan Sommer regarding SeaLogistics.  Since that time, we have completed
a merger with one of our primary competitors, launched our bulk
shipping/e-chartering exchange and now have begun trading on the site.  We
currently have support from charterers representing approximately 10% of the
global petroleum shipping spot market volume and from ship owners
representing approximately 15% of the large tanker fleet.

I saw that Enron announced last month its entry into the freight futures
market for bulk petroleum shipping.  Given this event and our marketplace
momentum, I thought it may make sense to have a more strategic discussion
around possible opportunities between Enron and SeaLogistics.

Please let me know your interest in discussing further a potential joint
opportunity.

Best regards,

Brad

Subject: First Gas

Privileged and Confidential Attorney-Client Communication

Mike Brown, David Terlip, Janice Moore and I met today.  Plan is for Mike to 
get an answer from Siemens (probably this week or next) on spec.  If Siemens 
amenable to relax First Gas' spec to plant, request First Gas to relax it's 
spec to us.  Mike will report to you as soon as he has heard from Siemens.   
If either Siemens or First Gas recalcitrant, move to litigation strategy.  
This would mean at next cargo delivery (due mid-November):  (1)  if cargo 
"off spec" demand separate test using "ashing" technique (more likely to 
pass) and if it passes using "ashing" declare on spec and arbitrate dispute 
over acceptance of "ashing" as industry standard; (2) if cargo rejected 
(either because First Gas refuses to accept "ashing" or because off spec even 
with "ashing") resale cargo and force First Gas to locate alternative 
supplies; dispute First Gas invoice for cost of cover.   Mike mentioned a 
possible dispute over storage which could also arise with the next delivery.  
This could bring us into a dispute with First Gas even if the cargo is on 
spec.

Our plan is to get back to you in any event next week when you return with a 
status report.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Cheers.  And congratulations on the Sooners' win.

Subject: Juvenile Diabetes Foundation Fundraising

It is my sincere honor to once again lead the Enron team in this year's 
Juvenile Diabetes Foundation (JDF) walk scheduled to take place on Sunday, 
November 5, 2000, at the Sam Houston Race Park.  I continue to serve on the 
board of JDF representing Enron and will be Enron's corporate executive for 
this year's fundraising efforts.

As many of you may already know, I am an insulin dependent diabetic myself.  
Even though I know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the 
multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day, I cannot 
imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease.  Taking 
insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of 
complications; insulin is simply their life support system and without it 
they would die.

Enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for JDF again this year.  JDF 
is a very efficient organization in which approximately 84% of all money 
raised goes directly to research.  Enron's goal this year is to raise 
$225,000 and we need your help.  Enron has been the number 1 walk team for 5 
years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place!  We need team 
leaders, walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal.  The theme for the 
walk this year is "Knock Out Diabetes" and we would like to have you join us 
for this great event.  The Walk is truly a blast and we had about 500 Enron 
people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it.

If you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader, or if 
you would like to make a pledge, you may call any of the steering committee 
members listed below.  If you are interested in being a team leader, please 
contact one of the following people immediately so that you may be included 
in the first important and informative training session taking place this 
week.

Thank you very much for your support.

Hello Mike,

My name is Brian Dawson and I work in ENA Merchant Finance.   I heard you 
speak at the Adams Mark Hotel last week discussing the future of EGM.  I 
wanted to let you know that I may have some information that might be useful 
to you.  I have a close friend who is the Vice President Marketing/Purchasing 
of Rigid Building Systems located off of Aldine Westfield and Beltway 8.  He 
has over 20 years in the industry of buying from the mills and selling steel 
components to contractors, end users, and service centers.  We were 
discussing the steel industry as a whole and some of his ideals were 
identical to yours.  I didn't know if you would be the right person for this 
information.  If you would like for me to forward this information to someone 
else, please let me know.  Thank you for your consideration.

Brian Dawson

  As we get bids for Project Jose, we should keep him informed but move 
forward with getting the competitive bids.

Subject: EECC'S ROLE AND MISSION

Several developers in your groups have asked questions recently concerning 
the future of EECC and whether EECC would be there for them in the planning 
process for future Enron turnkeys.  Some of these turnkeys, like Venezuela 
LNG, we are currently working on but there's some uncertainty in their minds 
whether or not we'll be allowed to do the project.  Let me clarify the 
current situation.  

Lou Pai and I have briefed Jeff Skilling as part of the 2001 budget process 
and obtained his approval for EECC to continue with the following role:  

EECC will manage Enron's technical and engineering risk for large asset 
construction projects.  EECC can perform the Enron turnkeys when we mutually 
agree that we have the market price and schedule.
EECC will shut down third party work (not related to Enron projects except 
for NEPCO and power projects).
EECC will leverage its approach to technical engineering and construction 
risk management to develop new products and services, for example, lender's 
engineering due diligence, etc.
EECC will develop an Enron Construction Risk Book for all Enron projects, 
including NEPCO.  (This process is underway with the help of Rick Buy's group 
and should be completed by mid-December.)
EECC will transition NEPCO into our project power company.  I'm beginning 
this transition by moving the Enron Brazil projects and their project teams 
under the NEPCO umbrella.  However, NEPCO cannot manage the Arcos project in 
Spain, which has already begun engineering, and I will grandfather Arcos (and 
probably the second project in Spain) inside EECC.

As before, business units can bid for outside prices and schedules.  I think 
in that regard nothing has changed.  I would like to continue working with 
your teams to continue looking for the best deal for Enron on every project, 
whether that's an EECC/NEPCO EPC or an outside EPC.  I think we expect to 
manage the outside contractors when a decision is made that the best choice 
for a particular project is a third party contractor.  I would like to follow 
up and meet with you in due course to answer any other questions.

Subject: Dolphin Q&As  

Rick,

Consistent with our discussions and the information you provided, I intend to 
use the following additional statements if needed to respond to media 
inquiries.  Your comments and approval would be appreciated.

Q.  Can you confirm that the contract will be signed in March?

A.  We expect that a "Heads of Agreement" between the governments of Qatar 
and the UAE will be signed.  This is a very significant agreement outlining 
commercial terms for the development of Qatari gas for export to the UAE.  
With this government-to-government protocol, the project developers (UAE 
Offsets Group, TotalFinaElf and Enron) can now proceed with negotiations over 
other key elements such as the Production Sharing Agreement, GSA and 
transmission access agreements.   It will be a number of months before these 
other agreements can be completed and sufficient detail is available for the 
Dolphin project developers to agree to and secure necessary approvals.

Q.  What are the details of the agreement with Qatar?

A.  The UAE Offsets Group as majority owner is the appropriate authority for 
comment on such an agreement.  In addition, as the project progresses, 
TotalFinaElf is expected to play a major role in the upstream development.  
Enron expects to focus its attention on gas marketing, pipeline development, 
project structuring/financing and risk management.

Q.  What will be Enron's financial commitment to the project?  

A.  It would not be appropriate to discuss specific cost figures at this 
stage.  However, I can say that we expect to project finance most of Enron 
and the other company's participation in Dolphin.  In addition, the Dolphin 
Strategic Partners have structured the project to provide for multiple 
investors, who will be offered the opportunity to join the venture after key 
project documents are executed.  


Q.  Offsets has often described Dolphin as a $10 billion project.  Is this 
true?

A.  It would not be appropriate to discuss project costs at this time.  
However, it is clear that the cost for the initial phases of the project 
(production and delivery of 2 to 3 bcfd of gas from Qatar to the UAE) is 
nowhere near this amount.  The $10 billion number assumes later expansions of 
the project to supply Oman, Pakistan and possibly India, plus an investment 
multiplier effect to reflect the potential new downstream facilities that end 
users will be able to build once Dolphin gas is available to fuel such new 
facilities

Subject: Garcia Munte / Spain


The situation of this file, which was on the last leg , is suddenly 
worsening.  (cargo payment exposure decreasing as follows :  19 million oct 
3rd  / 14.5 million oct 15th / 5 million oct 30th,  zeroing in november  as 
we have stopped deliveries to GM  - We continue only to supply KPC and Conti 
cargoes direct to the third parties) .
Main cause is the fuel crisis in Europe, particularly in Spain,  where 
combination of prices kept low under government pressure, and blockade of 
terminals by strikers, have cut  the cash flow of GM,  putting into peril the 
above plan;  and this is worsened by the attitude of the owner, who seems to 
be unable to face the situation. He is now stopping his management effort to 
sell the company,  which was the only viable solution;  the company being 
unable financially to sustain the burden of carrying the strategic  
inventories, a direct consequence of the increase of the trading volume in 
the early 2000.   
As a reminder, we have 20 million USD of strategic inventories in the name 
(and paper control) of ECTRIC Spain. We need however to urgently get 3 more 
documents  to have paper  title/possession of these, with always the risk 
that a Spanish liquidator contest our position.
We could initiate the sale of these inventories, however as they are used by 
GM in their strategic inventory figure, we immediately make GM unable to 
continue their operations, as they will loose their operating licence and 
stop payments...

GM general manager was here today, he was asking if Enron could step in and 
save the company ;  however,  it doesnot seem to be possible without 
increasing our exposure, which we have no appetite for..

We are going to meet asap GM President to put all possible pressure on him to 
accept to sell the company to a third party (Tamoil/BP are  potential 
buyers), and sign the few documents missing, giving us full control of ECTRIC 
Spain. We will then monitor situation on a daily basis;  fear that we will be 
in a difficult corner if Spanish conflict is not ending, and if company 
cannot get sold.

Thanks
Michel

RE: Flair Construction Co., Inc. / Purchase of Lots Six (6) and Seven (7),
Block One (1), THE LAKES OF STERLING GATE, Section One (1)

Dear Mr. & Mrs. McConnell:

Enclosed is a blue lined copy of the Survey we received today from the Title
Company.  Please note that there is a thirty five foot (35') Reliant
Energy/Entex pipeline easement and a fourteen foot (14') utility easement at
the rear of the property.  In addition, the fourteen foot (14') utility
easement runs along the northwest property line.  As such, no permanent
fixture will be allowed to be built over these easements, including a
swimming pool, gazebo or similar structure.

The Earnest Money Contract provides that you have seven (7) days from the
receipt of the Survey to object in writing to items appearing on the Survey.
However, we do not believe that Flair Construction can alter these
easements in any way, shape or form, and as such, the easements will most
likely remain intact.  If you feel that the easements will impair the
construction of your home, swimming pool or related structures, please
advise us immediately so that we may notify Flair of your objections.  If
the objections are not cured within twenty (20) days after Flair receives
them, in writing, the closing date may be extended.  If, however, the
objections are not cured by the extended closing date, the Contract will
terminate and your earnest money should be refunded to you.  We just wanted
to make sure that you were aware of your rights regarding this matter.

Assuming the easements cause you no problems, you should be ready to close.
We will be happy to schedule a closing with the Title Company and with Flair
if you can provide us with a number of dates that are convenient for both of
you to appear at the closing.  We will be happy to appear as well.

Very truly yours,

Subject: RE: Wharton privatization course


Christie,

no problem.  The course is a MBA course on privatization.  We currently talk 
about project finance, and the idea was for Bill Gathman to talk about 
Enron's Dabhol project.  However, this could be substituted with a discussion 
of Enron's project finance activities in general, or with another project.  
There are 55 students in the course (48 MBAs in their first and second years, 
4 law school students in their 2nd year, and Ph.D. students in various 
years).  Dates are either 16 or 18 April, the class starts at 10:30 am and 
runs to noon.

Let me know if you need any additional information.  Thank you.  Felix

Hi Felix!

Sorry I have not yet had any luck.  However, I will give it one more try.
Would you please again give me the following:
course description, date, # and year of students?  Sorry for your
inconvenience...I'm really strapped for time, and this will be easier for
me than trying to relocate the information you've provided before.

Thanks!

Hi Christie,

I was wondering if you had any luck with finding a speaker for the
privatization course.

Thanks for your help with this.

Jeannie,
Hello, I'm back this morning from overseas.  I am assuming that you got what 
you needed but in case you are still waiting on a response, I like the 
article.  If you still have time or want any additional comments.  I would 
simply add a couple of products to the list of Enron Global Markets.  The 
group is also responsible for Global Risk Management (insurance products), 
LNG trading, agriculture trading, and Interest rate trading.  I just don't 
want to leave any groups out of the article if possible.  Thanks and good 
luck and i certainly understand if I'm too late.

Joe,

Thanks for the email.  Project Summer does bring up some big questions and 
issues and I am not up to speed on the current thinking.  We'll talk later 
and i'll find out the issues and viewpoints.  On your other issue, I 
understand and we'll discuss.

Thanks,

Subject: SA Networks Effort

Mike,

You have probably heard that a tentative agreement has been reached on 
Project Summer.

When convenient, I would like to talk to you about what that means for the 
South Amercia Networks effort.  Given that we have been pursuing this stuff 
through a matrix approach many questions arise.

I am not sure of the Project Summer view or the Enron view.  I have the 
feeling it is not a "big blip" on anyone's radar screen. 

I did not bring this up during the weekly call because D'Arcy and Steve do 
not know anything (at least officially and/or from me).

Also, for what it is worth, I am assessing personal options at this point.  I 
am not necessarily wed to the "Newco" (unless Enron puts out a former EI 
hiring moratorium) despite what people may be assuming.

Thanks,

Kish

All,

Attached is a resume for Trevor Woods.  Trevor worked with me at HPL and 
directly for me in Technology.  He is outstanding and left to do the dot com 
thing with his brother-in-law who was CEO of this company.  He is interested 
to come back to Enron and is talking to various people around Enron.  He has 
offer opportunities at EBS and EES and has been talking with Billy Lemmons 
about ag.  Trevor is great and would be excellent in a Jr. commercial roll in 
an origination type of function.  

He is interested in moving pretty quickly and if you have an interest please 
contact him in the near future.  

Shanna can coordinate the times but i recommend him highly and he would be an 
asset to EGM.

Mr. McConnell,

I am an Energy Management major at OU who is interning here at Enron.  My 
work experience so far has been excellent, and nothing less than what I had 
hoped for.  I have had the opportunity to hear you speak a few times in 
Norman and have been very impressed.  I have been impressed by the things you 
said about this company and its ideals, programs and its commitment to 
excellence - all of which I have seen since I started work.  The most 
impressive thing to me, however, were the things you said about positive 
thinking, goal setting, and the power of the subconscious mind in your talk 
with the J.C. Penney Leadership Program.  These are beliefs which I have been 
raised on by my father, and really believe to be true.  It was very 
inspirational to hear that type of message from someone else for whom it has 
obviously worked.  As I have started my internship here, I am implementing 
this psychology into my life and work ethic, and thought you would might have 
some helpful advice.  I know you are an extremely busy man, but I decided to 
send you an email and ask if you ever had a few free minutes in which I could 
speak with you about how this way of thinking has positively impacted your 
career.  If you ever have a few minutes of free time this summer, I would 
really appreciate the opportunity to speak with you.

Thank you for your time

Blake Lasuzzo

Greg,  a couple of other thoughts and ideas for Monday's meeting.

I would like to discuss the entire process chain as part of the timelines, 
personnel responsibilities and key action items.  I think this is another 
good way to find any potential gaps and help prioritize various items and 
assignments.
Andrew Parsons Sr. Director (and superior performer) is a great and very 
smart guy that can add a lot of value to the effort.  You will like him and 
he will be a very valuable resource to add to the team - even if it is for a 
couple of weeks.  He wrote the IT compliance process chain and could reverse 
engineer difficult parts that are unique to the Ariba platform.  He has 
others on his team that could help and I've asked him to think about his 
existing AA resources that are available (some are working on ClickPaper 
already).
Other resources that have been identified to potential added firepower in the 
short run:  Beth Pearlman, John Tollefson (IT), Bob Schultz (LK said she 
could spare him without delaying phase 2 roll out), Dave Forester (not a good 
option because it would definitely set back phase 2 roll out), Mary 
Solmenson, Scott Mills, Berry Pearce, David Port, David Sweeny, Sally Beck 
(advice and discuss additional resources).
I did ask Louise to jump in (and i know you did too) to help on some quick 
thoughts on process and lessons learned.
I saw the process maps for EOL and I think they, or the simplified early 
versions, are very important and key to a successful launch for ClickPaper.
I went by to see Mark Palmer (he was out) and left him a voice mail on the 
marketing effort and what Margarat Allen is doing.  I wanted him to make sure 
that he understood the importance and priority of this effort.
I also talked with Beth Pearlman about helping out (or assigning John 
Tollefson) and I told her that we would be talking about this on Monday 
afternoon.
Do we need to have Alan Aronowitz or Mark Taylor look over the agreements to 
add a trading perspective?

A few thoughts,  see you tomorrow.

mike

Subject: LNG Offsite -----Nov 20/21

Mike/Jeff:  

Each year at about this time I hold an LNG Offsite meeting to review the 
progress of the year and to set direction for the next year.  This year's 
offsite has been scheduled for 20/21 November at the woodlands.  We picked 
these dates and reserved (and paid for) the Woodlands earlier this year 
because almost all members of the worldwide LNG team will be in the US at 
this time for either the San Antonio conference or Gastech.

Given the recent reorganization and changes in Enron's international 
direction, I feel that this meeting is more vital than usual.

I assume that some members of the group will want to take vacation later in 
the week because of Thanksgiving---therefore, I plan to compress the offsite 
into a one-day meeting on 20 November and leave 21 Nov for ad-hoc team 
meetings and/or golf for those who want to stay another day.

This would be a perfect opportunity to educate the entire team on "mark to 
market" mechanics, the LNG "book", enron online and any other similar topics 
that may be appropriate.  To that end, we are working on the following agenda:

Overview of EGM/Enron Corp direction:  Mick Mcconnell/Jeff Shankman

LNG organization and strategic objectives:  Rick Bergsieker/Eric Gonzales

LNG risk book:     Presented by Merritt Thomas/Brad Hitch??

Enron Online demonstration and applications to LNG:    Presented by Brad Hitch

Mark to Market fundamentals and applications to LNG:    Presented by Brent 
Price

2000 review/objectives for 2001:

Eastern Hemisphere:  Clay Harris

Atlantic Basin:  Doug Arnell/Emilio Vicens

Shipping, terminalling and Fuel Management:   Wayne Perry

Legal:  Dan Rogers

Several questions:

Mike/Jeff:  would either or both of you be available to participate,at least 
for an hour or so to get us started?

Eric:  can you be there at least for Monday?

Jeff:  have I picked the right people for risk book and online presentations?

Brent:  can you be there to conduct a seminar on Mark-to-Market (including 
key contractual provisions required)?

FYI, Wayne Perry and his assistant Cindy Long are coordinating arrangements 
for this offsite.

This is the proposed invite list to the LNG offsite that has been scheduled 
for the Woodlands on Monday, Nov. 20. Please send me the names of any 
additions you suggest. I would like to get out a note to people on this ASAP.

We plan an all day meeting on Monday and Golf, etc for those that want to do 
so on Tuesday. That way those that need to travel or work are only tied down 
one day. I would also appreciate any agenda ideas you may want to include.

Dear Mike: 

The artwork Blue Note is $4,500 framed like the previous artwork you saw here 
but if you choose a more expensive frame like the one you saw on the Matisse, 
the framed price would also increase.? I will speak to the owner tomorrow 
about price negotiations on your behalf.? Before I sit down with him, where 
do you stand on price?? It is important I have this information, so I can 
take this to the owner on your behalf. 

I must mention we stand behind all our artworks. All artworks are 
authenticated and qualified with a condition report.? In fact, each artwork 
comes with an authenticity signed by the owner.? Also if you have any 
questions you are always welcome to speak to the owner or our Director of 
Rare and Fine Prints about the art historical and physical nature of the 
work. 

If this artwork is priced somewhere else for much less one may question the 
condition or various other factors of the artwork. 

Look forward to hearing form you.

there room on the price if I give you a firm commitment.? The ebay price is 
significantly discounted but they are not ready to close the deal yet

Dear Mike: 

Glad to hear from you. 

The Lichtenstein "Composition No. 4" is exactly like the one you saw except 
that it would be a different number in the signed and numbered edition. 
The 
price is $4,500.00.? That is unframed.? We can frame the artwork like the 
Liechtenstein you saw here or if you prefer like the Matisse.? You have 
that 
option. 

I will contact the owner and send you an image either by e-mail or by mail. 
The window of opportunity to acquire the artwork is limited. 

I would love to talk to you personally about the Matisse "Icarus" artwork. 
When would be the best time to contact you and Chris? 

As I mentioned to you this artwork is hard to find and cannot be easily 
replaced.? Please keep in mind that several of our consultants are working 
with clients and galleries to place this artwork.? I mention this only to 
encourage to contact me if you have serious interest in adding this artwork

Don,

Thanks for the email and quick response.  I'll address in more detail later, 
I'm gong out of town again this morning, but I did call Alan Kent and you 
will have a copy of his standard construction agreement and a copy of the 
deed restrictions e-mailed today.

Also please call Alan directly with any questions on the contract.  Larry is 
his real estate agent for selling homes in this subdivision and i believe he 
is just helping him.  Alan should be able to answer most of your questions 
for clarifications quickly.  I don't need to be an intermediary.  In case you 
don't have his numbers, he can be reached at his office at 281 376-1500 or 
cell 281 960-3749.

We can discuss the other issues you addressed later when i get a chance to 
review them more carefully.  We are comfortable with Alan as the builder and 
want him to build the house, we just want to have a remedy if things don't go 
well.

Thanks,
mike

RE: Proposed Unimproved Property Contract by and between Flair Construction
Co., Inc., as Seller, and Mike and Chris McConnell, as Buyer

Dear Mike:

We have read and reviewed the above referenced Contract and your letter to
us regarding same dated February 20, 2001.  We want to respond to the
questions and issues raised in your letter as well as make some suggestions
and comments about the proposed Contract itself.

First, the Contract being used is the standard type of Contract used for the
proposed transaction.  The Contract is promulgated by the Texas Real Estate
Commission and is to be used by all licensed Real Estate Brokers and Agents.
We are interested in knowing, however, if the Contract was filled out by Mr.
Larry Williams of Prudential Gary Greene Realtors.  If so, does Mr. Williams
represent you or Flair Construction Co., Inc.?  Please advise us
accordingly.

As we discussed, we think it is most important that you have the opportunity
to read and review the Construction Agreement that Flair Construction Co.,
Inc. intends on using for the construction of your home.  The fact that
Flair is both the Developer, as well as the potential Builder, raises some
issues.  Usually, Builders have agreements with the Developer regarding the
purchase of lots and building on same.  Often, lots are reserved to certain
Builders and if you purchase those lots you are required to use the
designated Builders.  However, often lots are free to be purchased by
potential homeowners who then can choose the Builder they want.  We are
interested in knowing if the lots you are purchasing are actually reserved
to Flair Construction Co. Inc., or is Flair just requiring you to use them
to build your home since they are selling you the lots in question?  As you
point out in your letter, if you sign the Contract as it now reads, you are
captive to the Builder and are not free to negotiate with other Builders.

It appears to us that you will be one of the first homeowners in this new
subdivision.  We think it is critically important that you get a copy of the
Deed Restrictions even before you sign the Contract to make sure that there
are restrictions in place regarding the size of homes to be built, size of
lots, etc.  We want to make sure that your home is not horribly atypical for
the neighborhood.

We do not know if The Lakes of Sterling Gate Estates is in the City of
Houston or within its extraterritorial jurisdiction.  This is something you
may want to find out as soon as possible.  If it is outside the city limits,
is there already a MUD district in place to provide water and sewer
services?  Since this is a brand new subdivision your concern regarding its
future development and tax rate is very legitimate.  Usually, until the
subdivision is fairly well built out, the Developer controls the Community
Association as well as the Architectural Control Committee.  Therefore, if
this subdivision does not take off you will be under the control of the
Developer.

We recommend in the strongest terms possible that you talk with recent
customers of Flair Construction Co. Inc., to make sure that they were happy
with the construction of their homes, as well as warranty work.  Some
Builders are far better than others as it relates to follow-up warranty work
after their customers move into their homes.  We normally recommend that
homeowners do not move into their homes until all punch list items are
completed to the satisfaction of the homeowner.

The foregoing was our general comments regarding the proposed Contract.  We
will now make more specific comments and suggestions in chronological order
regarding the Contract:

1. Paragraph 2. PROPERTY.  As we previously stated, we think it is important
that you acquire copies of the Restrictive Covenants and Deed Restrictions
as soon as possible.  You will be responsible to pay assessments to the
Property Owners Association.  Since Flair is both the Builder and Developer,
you may want to ask Mr. Kent for an estimate of what your Community
Association Fees will be.

2. Paragraph 5. EARNEST MONEY.  We suggest that the earnest money be paid to
the Title Company and not to Flair Construction Co. Inc.

3. Paragraph 6. TITLE POLICY AND SURVEY.  (6)  The standard printed
exception as to discrepancies, conflicts, shortages in area or boundary
lines, encroachments or protrusions or overlapping improvements is in your
Owners Policy.  In other words, the title policy does not cover these types
of discrepancies or conflicts.  However, if a survey is completed and an
additional fifteen percent (15%) of the policy premium is paid, the title
company will probably delete this exception.  This is something you may want
to consider.  However, this cost would be yours to incur.  If, however, it
is subsequently discovered that there are such discrepancies and conflicts
or shortages, then you will have title insurance coverage accordingly.

4. Paragraph 6. TITLE POLICY AND SURVEY, last paragraph.  Make sure you are
provided a copy of the Commitment for Title Insurance as soon as possible.

5. Paragraph 6. TITLE POLICY AND SURVEY B (3).  It appears to us that the
only survey you will be provided with by the Seller is one for the new
recorded plat of the subdivision.  Therefore, the Seller is not providing
you a survey of your actual lots.  If you were to have the standard printed
exception as to discrepancies and conflicts deleted, we believe you would
need a survey of your lots.  You will have seven (7) days after you receive
the Commitment and/or the survey to object in writing to any matters
disclosed or you will be deemed to waive such objections accordingly.
Therefore, please make sure that we have the opportunity to review the
survey and commitment as soon as possible after you receive same.

6. Paragraph 6. TITLE POLICY AND SURVEY (6).  We agree that this paragraph
relating to the Sellers right to continue to show the property for sale
should be deleted.

7. Paragraph 7. PROPERTY CONDITION: B (1).  We suggest that this paragraph
be checked and utilized rather than paragraph 7B (2) which states that you
will be accepting the property in its present condition.  Paragraph 7B (1)
states that you will pay a fee, usually very small, like $100.00, for the
unrestricted right to terminate the contract in the event the property is
not suitable for the purposes for which you intend on using it.  In other
words, you can have whatever inspectors you deem necessary to look at the
property to make sure that it is satisfactory for your home construction.
We often suggest that an independent inspector be hired by the homeowner to
inspect and review the construction of the home as it progresses.  In
addition, there may be some environmental issues or soil condition questions
that an inspector might raise if given the opportunity.  As the Contract now
reads, you are simply accepting the property as is and have no right to send
an inspector out to the property accordingly.

8. Paragraph 8. BROKERS' FEES.  You may want an affirmative statement that
you as the Buyer will not be responsible for or pay any Brokers' fees.

9. Paragraph 11. SPECIAL PROVISIONS.  It is written in that the closing on
these lots will be as soon as roads are in place or on March 1, 2001,
whichever is later.  However, we do not know what roads are being addressed
and think that this sentence needs far more specificity.  The second
sentence regarding your obligation to use Flair Homes has already been
addressed earlier.  The third sentence regarding when construction must
start should be revised to give you more time as you make reference in your
letter.  However, we also suggest that the Builder be put under an
obligation to start construction within thirty (30) days after the date you
notify him that you are ready for construction to begin.

10. Paragraph 13. ROLLBACK TAXES.  If there was ever an agricultural or
timber exemption on this property, you need to know.  Otherwise, you will be
obligated to pay rollback taxes on the property which may go back five (5)
years.

11. Paragraph 18. ESCROW.  As we indicated earlier, we believe your earnest
money should be paid to the title company.  In light of the fact that the
earnest money is in excess of $50,000.00 and the closing date on the lots is
somewhat uncertain, we suggest that you ask the title company to deposit the
earnest money in an interest bearing account and that you receive a credit
accordingly.

Please call us after you read and review this letter.

       Very truly yours,



       Donald S. Stirman

Subject: Ag Recruiting

Mike -
      I wanted to follow up with you regarding Billy Lemmons.  As you know, 
both myself and Gary have spoken to Billy about an opportunity in the Ag 
effort.  I think Billy could help us pursue the origination opportunities we 
discussed on Wednesday and help us develop many more.  In addition to the 
tremendous experience he would bring to our team, he seems genuinely 
interested and excited about the opportunity.
      I know you and Billy have discussed the Ag effort and I wanted to know 
if you felt this would be the right move for Billy at this time.  Certainly, 
it is his decision but I believe he is looking to you for EGM's committment 
to Agriculture.

Please let me know if I can answer any questions you may have.

John,

Hello from South America.  I just got your email and I certainly concur with 
Jeff making the call.  He has maintained a good relationship with Mulva. This 
was a risk that we had but we did have assurances from Phillips regarding 
performance.  I don't know how much it will help however.  Richard Harper and 
Mary Nell Browning may have some ideas here but I am sure you've already gone 
through it with them.  I am amazed how the details get fuzzy on an old 
project.  When you discussed it, i was trying to think back to our remedies 
and discussions but the 3 years have made it difficult.

I don't know if there is anything I can do but I'm always willing to help.

Good luck,
Mike

Subject: J-Block


I mentioned on our conference call on Monday that J-Block has had problems 
meeting our nominations from the Judy/Joanne/Janice reservoirs.

Up until recent CATS maintenance shutdown on 15 May, they were making up for 
reduced production volumes by nominating to supply gas at the NBP which they 
are entitled but not obliged to do.  Since return from outage at the end of 
May they have declined to nominate at the NBP.  

>From 1 January to 15 May, the Sellers use of the NBP delivery option kept 
underdeliveries to 350 mmcf (ie one day's maximum quantity) in total.  Since 
returning from the maintenance shutdown, underdeliveries have totalled 850 
mmcf ( averaging 77mcf/d ).

We believe that following the sharp rise in market prices during the 
maintenance period, they have decided to default on the contract rather than 
make up deliveries from other sources.   They have an effective cap on the 
penalties of about 5 pence per therm (after taking into account the value of 
the liquids) and therefore they are not making up the volumes when the daily 
price is substantially higher than about 16 pence per therm.

Prior to the CATS shutdown, we had made them a proposal to enable them to 
deliver additional volumes at  another alternative to avoid default but they 
have not responded yet.

You mentioned that in your negotiations with Phillips they had committed to 
getting us all the gas regardless of the cap on the penalties.  This has cost 
us about $1.5 million to date and they seem to be institutionalising their 
non performance.    Perhaps a phone call by you might help.  

By the way I will be in Houston on Thursday and Friday to meet with the 
delegation from Croatia and I will probably be tied up the entire time but if 
you need me
for a phone call I can break away.

John

I see that we are scheduled to have lunch today.   I may have to postpone 
again, I'll let you know later this morning.  I am out all weekend and we 
have to have the final comments on the Analyst Presentation in by sunday 
night so I may be working over lunch.  Actually, I think we are in pretty 
good shape so I will probably be doing lunch but just don't be too mad if I 
have to cancel.

PS  Your brother told me he went to 3 bowl games (when I found out that two 
of them were the galleryfurniture.com bowl and that one in Shreveport (I 
can't remember the name of it)) I realized he is a very, very sick college 
football fan.

Jeff, 
Let me know what you think.  Please make changes to make more accurate and 
effective.  I will send this to him and follow up with a discussion.  It 
needs some work.

John,

I have just had some additional discussions on our Global weather business 
and have come to a decision on how we need to run the weather business.   I 
believe that we do  need 100% full time dedication from each and any employee 
that is dedicated to the weather business including in the overall 
development and execution of or global strategy and positions.   I have a 
great deal of confidence and am holding Mark Tawney responsible and 
accountable for extensive growth and profitability in the business.

We need to hire additional people to add to grow the business in Japan and 
Australia.  Joe and Paul are on board with this strategy and Mark will work 
with them to accomplish the hiring of people and needed resources.  This will 
not be talk but we will get these people in place by specific deadlines.  We 
will pay all of those people's expenses and they will be on board with the 
hiring and will be expected to be a valuable team player and resource to 
their group.

On the Norway front, we need to implement the same organization structure.  
We have talked a lot about Thor and better communication, but we need to make 
a change.  We will have weekly calls with him and the weather group to make 
sure that we are all on the same page and he is up to speed with where we are 
going.  Jeff did have a video call with Thor to talk about his email and it 
went well.  Upon my return I learned that Thor and the London group put out a 
press release about putting out pricing on 1,000 cities and even changing the 
index.  Neither Mark or Jeff were even aware of this event nor was it even 
brought up in the call as something that was going to happen.  Also the 
hiring of xxxxxx as a weather  originator, without any discussion, also 
illustrates the lack of communication or desire to work together.  I am not 
saying that Mark or Thor are totally to blame, they both deserve credit for 
not working together, but  we are going to change the future and make sure 
that it will work better.  I know that all of Thor's group is very loyal to 
Thor and may not want to transition into EGM and if that is the case, we can 
make it work via London.  I think the key is our approach to Thor and that 
this isn't meant as a reflection on him but is a consistent change with how 
we are running all of our businesses around the world.  The weather piece of 
his business is very small and isn't going to effect his P&L significantly 
(he'll actually be net positive!)

Please give me a call and we will discuss the issues surrounding this new 
structure and the best way to communicate it to those involved to make this 
the most effective.

This email is going just to you and Jeff and won't be shared with anyone else.

mike

Hi Mike,

I don't know if you'll appreciate the following info, but there is a book 
called "The Cure For All Diseases" by Hulda Clark. She outlines how to cure 
diabetes so there is no need to take insulin.  It worked for my hypoglycemia, 
and a lot of other things.

Chris,

Thanks for the response and thanks for the consideration.  I accept and we're 
done.  I will have a check out to you today via overnight mail.

Price:  9,500 less $500 plus $150 = $9,150

Please ship to:

Mike McConnell

I look forward to doing business with you in the future.  I'll let you know 
the next time I'm back in the market for a specific piece or artist.  Also 
please give my home a call (281-895-6855) when the piece gets in the mail so 
that I can make sure that my wife is around to accept delivery.

Sincerely,
Mike 

PS - Your price was right on the mark for an easy personal decision.  My wife 
actually preferred another piece that was slightly cheaper and this let me 
get my favorite piece!

Subject: E-commerce: An Enron View ppt

Hi Mike, 

I am an account manger in the San Ramon, CA office.  I am also an MBA 
student.  I am currently taking a class in marketing and my group will be 
doing a presentation on E-commerce and how it is affecting the way businesses 
are marketing to their customers (and even how they decide what customers to 
market to).  I came across your powerpoint presentation on the EnronOnline 
website and found the information to be extremely relevant and useful to what 
we plan on covering.  Would it be possible to get a copy of that presentation 
from you?  Also, would you be able to provide more insight on how you feel 
the internet has made an impact on the energy industry?  I recently heard 
that a couple of other utilities (I believe Duke and Sempra) are also putting 
together plans for e-commerce websites.  What are your thoughts on that?

Any insight and information you could provide would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks, 
Renee Fernandez

Jeannie,

Thanks for asking about my dad, he is doing very well after surgery which we 
believe was successful.

My kids loved it.  The really enjoyed learning about Dad's work and what I 
do.  I think that this is a very important event because we all spend so much 
time here at Enron.  I have two children Claire - 9  and Michael - 6. They 
both look forward to the event and talk about it for weeks prior to the 
actual day.  Actually my daughter talks about it all year long.  Also they 
really can identify with Enron and talk more about it because of events like 
these.

Mike

Mike -- I hope you don't mind this, but I remember seeing you and your 
children at Take Your Child to Work day. I'm writing up a small story for 
Enron Business, and I wonder if you have a comment to make on this day.

Did you and your children enjoy the day? What were their favorite activities?
With all the things you have on your plate, why did you take the time to 
bring them in and accompany them during the day?
What are your children's names and their ages?
Any general comment you wish to make.

If you have time for this, I'd love to see what you have to say.

I hope things are going well for your father.

Regards,
Jeannie

All,

Attached, for your information, is  a copy of a general presentation that I 
prepared to illustrate and describe EGM's businesses.  This is a presentation 
that will become a "living" document to communicate our businesses and 
growth.  I will be making numerous changes as we move closer to the analyst 
meeting in January but I wanted to give everyone a copy of this version.

Please don't hesitate to call me if you have any questions or comments.

Mike

Had internal meeting (Mahoney/Hardy/Davies/Quick/Anastasia), decided to :
1/ send a brief fax asking for whereabouts of payment due today
2/ will send tomorrow (if we don t have anything positive back) that we 
postpone meeting Barcelona due Thursday.

Seems from discussion with Anastasia/Pam Shaw that GM intends to propose a 
global package (whatever that means) during our next meeting, but we don t 
want to move over there, before we hear more details. 
Last minute : Pam now just calling saying Antonio will call us thursday to 
discuss late payment (tomorrow is holiday in Spain).
My feeling is that they will propose a part payment now, and balance plus end 
november instalment,  with a new time schedule.
Will need a few more boxes of candle..

Pup,

Hope your holiday is going great.  Talked with your office and got your 
Telluride number but you guys must be out playing.  OU game is coming 
quickly.  Chris is not going down, Mark and I only, and we are arriving to 
Miami on Tuesday afternoon and staying at the Hyatt.  We are out on Thursday 
afternoon.  Golf on Wednesday afternoon at Doral.  It should make for a fun 
trip.

When are you guys going down and where are you staying?  We need to set up a 
time to get together and to get the tickets.  Have you heard anything on 
Hieple (bad spelling) arm?  If he is healthy I would take the points!

We have made reservations for Continental for spring break but need to make 
sure that the timing is fine before we confirm.  We plan to fly out on 
Tuesday and return on Saturday.  I have a scheduling problem to get there any 
earlier.  

Give me a call if it is convenient, (713) 853-1450.  I've got a very light 
schedule on Friday, or you can email, whichever is easier.  

See you in a couple of days!

Love to all,
Mike

Go ENE stock, we back to 85!

PRC TIPS

EGM Management:

Below is a list of Tips for the Mid-Year PRC Process.  Each tip refers to 
information that we have received many questions about and would like to 
clear up any confusion.  We will be meeting with each of you individually 
before the final meetings to ensure that we have captured accurate 
information on all your employees for the meetings.  Please contact me if you 
need further information (X36019).

Exempt vs. Non-Exempt Employees:
? All exempt employees who were hired prior to Jan. 1, 2001 will be 
represented in a PRC meeting and will be ranked (those hired after Jan.1, 
2001 will receive feedback only).  Employees who transferred after 4/30/2001 
will be reviewed by their previous Business Unit.
? Non-exempt employees will receive feedback only, they will not be rated in 
a meeting, only those up for promotion will be discussed.  At year end they 
will be ranked in categories 1-3 only.

Preferred Distribution:
? The preferred distribution is as follows:
 Category 1= 5%
 Category 2= 30%
 Category 3= 30%
 Category 4= 20%
 Category 5= 15%

Descriptors vs. Ratings:
? Descriptors (highly effective, effective, etc...) are used on employee 
feedback forms only and reveal how the employee performs in a skill area 
(i.e.. communication, teamwork, etc...)
? The ratings refer to how the employee ranks next to his peers.  There are 5 
categories of performance ratings-
 -  1= relative to peers the employee is generally among the top 5% of his 
peers;
 -  2= relative to peers the employee is generally between 5%-35% of his 
peers;
 -  3= relative to peers the employee is generally between 35%-65% of his 
peers;
 -  4= relative to peers the employee is generally between 65%-85% of his 
peers;
 -  5= relative to peers the employee is generally among the bottom 15% of 
his   peers.

presentation. Please launch the attachment. 


Enron Global Markets has experienced tremendous growth since inception and 
this growth rate will continue to increase as new businesses and markets are 
developed.  In order to ensure EGM Operations & Accounting is positioned to 
provide the highest level of support and value to each EGM business unit, I 
am pleased to announce the following organizational changes effective 
immediately.

Physical Commodity Operations
These groups, which include Crude & Products, Coal, LNG, Freight and Weather, 
are being reorganized along functional lines to provide better focus and 
promote efficiencies across these operational activities.  Weather is being 
included in this group to maintain the consistency of current Operations 
leadership in this area.

      Business Risk Controls
Todd Hall will assume the role as Business Risk Controller on a worldwide 
basis for the physical businesses.  This group will have responsibility for 
all Risk Management activities and serve as the daily commercial interface 
for all operational issues that affect the physical businesses.

North America Operations
Michelle Bruce will assume responsibility for the following activities that 
support the physical businesses for North America:  Confirmations, 
Coordination, Settlements and Trade Accounting.  Michelle and her team will 
also play a key role in coordinating operational activities as they relate to 
potential acquisitions and new business opportunities within North America.

Europe/Asia Operations
Cindy Horn will continue in her role managing the following activities for 
the physical businesses in Europe and Asia:  Confirmations, Coordination, 
Settlements and Trade Accounting.  Cindy and her team will also have the 
critical responsibility of ensuring proper controls and processes are 
maintained for all new and existing markets throughout the region.  Tiong 
Hock Lim and his team in Singapore will report to Cindy.

Financial Commodity Operations
Sheila Glover will expand her current role and manage all business risk and 
operational activities for Financial Trading and Global Risk Management.  As 
the Global Risk Management business grows, Sheila will develop the 
operational processes and infrastructure necessary to support it.

Todd, Michelle, Cindy and Sheila will also work together as a Controller team 
to ensure processes and controls are consistent across EGM and that 
efficiencies are broadly applied.

Structuring/Transaction Analysis
Scott Earnest will assume responsibility for all commodity structuring and 
transaction analysis activities across EGM.  His duties will include pricing 
and valuation of new transactions and businesses, evaluation of existing 
transactions to identify restructuring opportunities and risk controls 
monitoring and reporting.  

Technology
Kevin Sweeney will continue in his role as Technology Controller.  Kevin and 
his team will be completing the implementation of Project Thunderball for 
Crude & Products and Coal and will also serve as the Business Leads for 
system enhancements and new technology opportunities that are identified.

Financial Operations & Accounting
Tom Myers will continue in his role of managing EGM Financial Operations & 
Accounting.  Tom and his group are responsible for EGM management reporting, 
Plan & Current Estimate preparation, the financial close process and G/L 
controls.

Please see the attached organizational chart for a more detailed look at the 
changes discussed above.

 

   Please join me in congratulating everyone on their new assignments.

FYI.  

Do not get overly excited about these number as things are moving 
significantly on the back end of the curve (i.e. be very conservative given 
MTM issues, credit reserves, etc.).  As we have indicated this deal is a 
company maker.  We thoroughly understand the PDVSA reserve issue and this is 
our number one priority to resolve.

Thanks again for taking the time to join us on our trip to Ven.  As we are in 
a critical stage of the deal, we will begin providing you a weekly progress 
report on the deal.

Regards,
Eric

Gary,

1.  Correct
2.  Global tech drove and directed the PRC (performance review committee) for 
all of it's employees.  Enron ranks all of it's employees 2 times a year.  
The employees are examined and given feedback on their performance.  It is a 
very lengthy process but it is very fair and insures and identifies excellent 
performance.  The criteria for the rankings comes from a person's 
accomplishments, characteristics and customer feedback from numerous 
sources.  It is all on computer and when we discuss a persons performance and 
ranking, that feedback (primarily from the business unit) is a key driver.  
Plus, there are business unit reps on the PRC.
3.  I guess the way i would describe it would be that on every major 
expenditure and project, the commercial people involved helped drive the 
process as well as our group looking at it the same way.  An example would be 
that traditionally any IT group or technologist is in love this the latest 
and greatest technology.  and could look at embedding a new system in the 
company because it is the latest technology and is very cool.   I would ask 
what commercial function does it perform and how does it give us a 
competitive advantage.  It was a very customer driven (internal and external 
customers) process.  It was also a mind set and paradigm shift internally 
within the group because they started looking at themselves adding to the 
bottom line rather than simply a cost center.

I hope that helps.

Sincerely, 
Mike

Hi Mike, three more questions. I hope I'm not wearing out my welcome.

1. Is Philippe Bibi spelled correctly?

2. You said, "When it came to the review process itself, Global Technology
ranked all the employees and peers but the business unit had the greatest
influence on where the person actually ranked and was rated." I may not have
gotten this down correctly, but I don't quite understand it. Are you saying 
that
IT basically just lists the people but the business units actually rate them?

3. When you refer to taking a "commercial" view of technology, what do you 
mean
exactly and how is that new?

Thanks again.

Regards,
Gary Anthes

Subject: Juvenile Diabetes Foundation Fundraising

It is my sincere honor to once again lead the Enron team in this year's 
Juvenile Diabetes Foundation (JDF) walk scheduled to take place on Sunday, 
November 5, 2000, at the Sam Houston Race Park.  I continue to serve on the 
board of JDF representing Enron and will be Enron's corporate executive for 
this year's fundraising efforts.

As many of you may already know, I am an insulin dependent diabetic myself.  
Even though I know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the 
multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day, I cannot 
imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease.  Taking 
insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of 
complications; insulin is simply their life support system and without it 
they would die.

Enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for JDF again this year.  JDF 
is a very efficient organization in which approximately 84% of all money 
raised goes directly to research.  Enron's goal this year is to raise 
$225,000 and we need your help.  Enron has been the number 1 walk team for 5 
years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place!  We need team 
leaders, walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal.  The theme for the 
walk this year is "Knock Out Diabetes" and we would like to have you join us 
for this great event.  The Walk is truly a blast and we had about 500 Enron 
people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it.

If you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader, or if 
you would like to make a pledge, you may call any of the steering committee 
members listed below.  If you are interested in being a team leader, please 
contact one of the following people immediately so that you may be included 
in the first important and informative training session taking place this 
week.

Thank you very much for your support.

All,

FYI, here is the latest draft of their business plan for your review and 
commentary.  I had the video call yesterday and went through all the org 
changes.  I did not provide any commentary on the specifics for obvious 
reasons.

Subject: Re: Draft Business Plan Enron Net Works South America  


I think there are 2 principal drivers:

(1)  the respective Business Unit heads inside of Networks (Houston or 
elsewhere ) need to know who Steve and I are, that we're involved and that we 
have a  mandate ( actually this probably warrants some clarification 
vis-a-vis the Argentine office, as well; especially given the hiring of 
Bastos - I for one would like  to get a clear and substantive understanding 
in regard to his trading background, priority for physical vs. financial 
products, and expectations ) and
(2)  we (Enron SA) need an invitation, but also need to probably be more 
aggressive about participating in meetings, discussions - both strategic 
and   functional for each of  the Business Units

Once we reach a consensus on an Enron SA Bus Plan with focus, targets will 
establish some parameters to participate inside the group going forward.  

Mike, your efforts to communicate both updating events vis-a-vis the weekly 
call and overtures outside the group have been a great initiative and much 
appreciated.  It's made an important, productive impression on Enron 
employees "outside"of Networks.  Look forward to further discussions all 
around.

Mike,

Per your request, attached is the draft Business Plan for South America. Due 
to agenda constraints, Joe Kishkill has not yet had the opportunity to review.

As part of structuring the regional effort, it would be important to 
streamline and coordinate the due diligence and market study efforts. There 
appears to be some confusion between Houston and S?o Paulo over who is 
responsible for what. We may need to formally announce D'Arcy's and my roles, 
including the need to channel information through us into and out of the 
region.

Please let us know your thoughts.

Thanks, Steve

Mike 

This issue has been going back and forth so Eric asked me to send you an 
email to see if we can resolve this issue.  I have been told by Eric that 
ProCaribe is in EGM and Mariella continues to say that it is EGA.  I can find 
reasons for this to fit in either place yet I think it is important to settle 
this ASAP.  I currently report into both groups so it is in my interest to 
resolve any misunderstandings as soon as they arise.  I hope all is well.

We did fall apart in baseball this year.  We are not a 1 sport team we are 
the sport team.  Football is just a tad more important then the others.  On 
last count our 7 national championships in "the" sport does add up.  By the 
way, we hold 2 national championships today, football and the mighty women's 
softball.

Here's a follow-up to our SABIC conversations.

 Doug did a great job on pitching Enron Online and answering all of their 
questions. I pushed them hard over lunch about the next step and how we get 
them to use Enron Online. I couldn't figure out why they were so hesitant 
until Mohammad told me they were (I think I heard him right) equity investors 
in Chem Connect. Quite simply, they know they made a mistake and need some 
time to explain why they would invest in one system but want to use another. 
What I need to do is follow up with a letter touting why they need to use 
Enron Online and why is doesn't conflict with Chem Connect.

There is another way we can continue to solidify our relationship: In late 
June their operations planning group will be in Houston (25-29). The 
Operations Planning and Economics Studies Group is headed by Vice President 
Al-Sadhan and would like to benchmark our operations, planning, budgeting and 
performance reporting. They are looking for a broad overview and I think we 
can put together a visit  that sells Enron as a partner. The more SABIC 
people exposed to us the better chance we have to make in roads. Who should I 
work with on setting up what should be no more than a 2-3 hour visit?

Finally, I should update you on Saudi and the gas initiative. As you know, 
when Oxy/Enron was invited into the Kingdom, SABIC approached me to partner 
in the downstream portion of the project. Since that time, Enron has had to 
notify the Saudi's that Oxy will be the lead, that we will not contribute an 
equity or directly participate in any segment of the project,  we will have 
an advisory role and will not sign the MOU on June 3. It looks like the Saudi 
reaction was to replace us with Marathon which is causing some heartburn with 
Oxy as they sort out partnership shares, Oxy not wanting to drop below their 
30%.  I have talked to Oxy about SABIC and think I can  keep SABIC's  
partnership interest alive. It is just a very delicate situation right now 
and Enron needs to stay quietly on the side lines until the signing on June 
3.

Dear Mike:
I apologize for my tardy response to the JDF Fund-raiser.  The letter went
to my old office at EnergyEcomm.com.  Unfortunately, that office has closed,
and it took a bit of time for the mail service to forward the letter.
Anyway, as they say, "The check is in the mail."
Best of luck in raising funds for such a worthy cause.

Hi Eric -

I am Mike's assistant and I believe you discussed this meeting with my clerk 
when I was out of the office on Monday.  I am preparing Mike's calendar for 
tomorrow and I would like to make sure that I have all the correct 
information for him regarding the El Paso meeting.  Can you please provide 
the exact details for the El Paso meeting?  In particular, will you be 
meeting Mike at his office or does he need to meet you somewhere else?  At 
what time does he need to meet you?

Any specific information that you can provide will be greatly appreciated.  
Thank you.

Mr. McConnell,

This is Jason Stirman, Don Stirman's son.  I e-mailed you my resume a few
weeks ago, and you sent it to a couple people from Enron.  I haven't heard
back from anyone yet, so I was wondering if you knew of someone I could
contact to follow up?  Thanks again for your help.

Sincerely,

Please cancel the Palm.Net service effective immediately.  I am no longer

CP,

Attached is the latest draft copy of the memo.  Each group has had an 
opportunity to comment and it has been amended several times.

I would like you to take a look at it and add your comments and changes.  You 
are always the key to a good memo and your changes are vital to making this a 
first rate memo.  Also Freight is in blue and i don't know how to take it 
back to normal.

I would like this out on Tuesday evening.  After i get your version back, go 
ahead and make your changes directly on the memo. Please send to Jeff for 
final review and one more pass thru the business units on Monday.

Thanks,
m

Darrell,

I attempted to call you a few minutes ago (late night your time - but there 
was no voicemail).  I didn't want to wait several more days before I contact 
you.  I'm out all weekend.

Eric shared with me some of your concerns about resources for a Korea LNG 
opportunity.  I certainly understand your view but wanted to share some of my 
thoughts.  Rick and/or Clay know the Asian LNG industry better than anyone 
else in the company.  They are very good and I have a lot of faith in them 
and their ability to assess opportunities and develop projects.  They are 
lacking wholesale type of transaction experience that a few of the guys that 
have recently come into the group have.  That is why we have brought them 
in.   We have a very strong team and i like the mix a lot.  

Eric is the person we chose to run the group for many reasons but it wasn't' 
done as a lack of faith in Rick or his original team.  The biggest 
opportunities and the viewpoint we must take in this business is running it 
like a wholesale unit and running it as a portfolio of transactions and 
books.  That certainly doesn't  mean that 20 years of experience doesn't have 
enormous value especially in the non-Atlantic markets.  Rick is in the 
process of coming back to Houston after the shut down of our middle east 
projects and strategy.  Rick is also in the process of assessing what exactly 
he would like to do in the time of transition.  My very sincere hope is that 
he will stay in the LNG group and perform a very important role especially in 
this type of development or deal making role.  Especially  in a big deal in 
Japan, Korea or something in the Asian area.  We will discuss this next week 
when he comes to town.  

I need Eric to be in Houston right now due to our Elba Island, Venezuela and 
Bahamas immediate activity.  He will certainly be engaged in everything but 
he can not be focuses as much as you need in Korea or Joe needs in Japan.

Please give me a call next week and we can discuss this in more detail.

Thanks,
mike


PS - Frevert also likes this role for Rick.  Also the Eric specific head role 
has not been officially announced yet.

Mike,

As a result of the recent reorganization, initially I will be responsible for 
the Weather and Insurance trading activities.  I look forward to working with 
you in these efforts.

What I really wanted to talk to you about is the JDF Walk.  Last year we 
discovered that our 2 1/2 year old son, Brandon, had diabetes.  As you 
remember, and certainly can relate to, this changed our lives forever.  In 
retrospect, I am glad that I got involved in Enron's effort even though it 
was in the last 3-4 weeks.  We have continued to stay involved with JDF by 
attending several events, by visiting the JDF office, and by JDF's proactive 
phone out-reach.  I would like to hear your take on sponsoring a team through 
Enron vs. directly through JDF.  I know that Enron matches the contributions 
if sponsored through Enron; is this possible if we were to go the other route?

Please call or email as I know we are approaching the campaign time.

Thanks,
Todd Hall

Subject: JDF Kick-Off Luncheon

By now all of you should have received an invitation to the JDF 2000 Walk to 
Cure Diabetes Kick-Off Luncheon on Wednesday, September 6th, 11:30 a.m. - 
1:00 p.m. at the Hyatt Regency Hotel.  I would like to take this opportunity 
to personally invite and encourage each of you to attend and join me as we 
represent Enron at this important meeting.

Our plan is to reserve several tables at the luncheon just for Enron.  
Whether you have received an invitation or not, I would like for each of you 
to make plans to join us at the luncheon.  In order to reserve sufficient 
seats at the luncheon (and even if you have already made a reservation with 
the JDF office) please send a brief Lotus Notes message to Cathy Phillips or 
call her at X-36898 to let her know if we may plan on your attendance.

I look forward to seeing you at the luncheon and working with you on the fun 
and exciting JDF campaign that we have planned for this year.  Thank you.

I just got the tickets the day I left for Telluride.  Why don't we just pick
you guys up for the game.  We aren't arriving until 3:00 on game day.  We're
staying at the Breakwater Hotel on South Beach (305) 532-1220.  I will have
my mobile phone (512) 426-1033.  What Hyatt are you staying at.

Your Spring Break schedule is great.

Pup,

Hope your holiday is going great.  Talked with your office and got your
Telluride number but you guys must be out playing.  OU game is coming
quickly.  Chris is not going down, Mark and I only, and we are arriving to
Miami on Tuesday afternoon and staying at the Hyatt.  We are out on
Thursday afternoon.  Golf on Wednesday afternoon at Doral.  It should make
for a fun trip.

When are you guys going down and where are you staying?  We need to set up
a time to get together and to get the tickets.  Have you heard anything on
Hieple (bad spelling) arm?  If he is healthy I would take the points!

We have made reservations for Continental for spring break but need to make
sure that the timing is fine before we confirm.  We plan to fly out on
Tuesday and return on Saturday.  I have a scheduling problem to get there
any earlier.

Give me a call if it is convenient, (713) 853-1450.  I've got a very light
schedule on Friday, or you can email, whichever is easier.

See you in a couple of days!

Love to all,
Mike

Go ENE stock, we back to 85!

Per,

I have over the past few weeks been involved in different transactions that
have led me to seek you to try and develop opportunities for Lehman and
Enron to work together.  Generally, my group here at Lehman (the Insurance
Products Group - "IPG") has become more involved with our investment bankers
in trying to find insurance/alternative solutions to assist clients (e.g.,
balance sheet cleansing, earnings smoothing, specific contingency insurance,
weather, etc.).  As a result of this dialogue, we have received very
positive responses from bankers/clients - specifically, two opportunities I
would like to discuss with you are 1) hedging of commodity risk for earnings
smoothing (e.g., OCC, ONP, etc.) and 2) purchasing claims against insolvent
insurance companies.  The third opportunity that I would like to discuss
with you relates to a recent insurance placement that my group did for a
hydrocarbon royalty securitization.  Although the insurance was limited to
currrency inconvertibility risk, I have spoken to a number of insurers that
were very interested in providing credit enhancement on these type of future
flow/asset transactions.  I understand that you are heading this effort as
well within Enron.

I apologize if this email if verbose, but I think there are good
opporunities here for us both.  Please give me a call at 212-526-9525 at
your earliest convenience.  Thanks.

Regards,

Inho

Rebecca,

Philippe being the only other corp officer within the large technology 
organization has an enormous volume of contracts to sign.  A large bulk of 
the signatures that are required come from two areas;  Infrastructure and 
ENA.  I would like to have 2 current Vice Presidents within the business 
units made corp VPs:  Beth Pearlman and Jenny Rub.

Can we make this happen and when would it occur?

Thanks,
Mike

Renee,

What a wonderful surprise to see you in the Enron Building today!  I thought 
you had left the Company.  Glad I was wrong.   I want to get caught up with 
what you've been up to since Park Street.   As I mentioned, maybe we can grab 
Mike and get some lunch next week.   Or if you and Mike have already shared 
recent histories you and I can go.  I have no plans next Wednesday, Thursday, 
or Friday.  Mike?

Don,

Thanks for the fax survey.  We couldn't read the numbers however.  Please 
mail a copy to our house when you get a chance.  

Are there any issues from your point of view?  I would like to understand 
what the limitations are on the easements but it appears that everything is 
done.  Are we ready to close and how do we do this?
Thanks,
Mike

Paragraph 9 of Schedule B of the Commitment for Title Insurance reflects the
number and size of the easements.  However, the survey will show where they
are actually located.  As soon as we receive the survey, we will advise you
accordingly.

Clay and I have completed our review visits in Korea and Japan.  I will be 
available in Houston starting the afternoom of 14 June and continuing through 
about end-June for PRC's and to discuss and finalize the Pacific Basin LNG 
strategy and organization issues that we highlighted when you were in Korea.  
As we discussed in Korea, I believe that if we intend to develop a Pacific 
Basin LNG business, (including the US west coast), we need to define and 
articulate a vision and strategy to the LNG group by the end of June or we 
risk having our Pacific team members drift away to our competitors.

There is a lot happening in the Pacific and our key people are well known and 
well thought of.  There is a genuine feeling within the team at this time 
that Enron's LNG focus is on North America/Atlantic basin and that there is 
little top management support for the commitment of time and resources to 
build a more global business.  

I'd like to set up a meeting with you to discuss this, preferably on 21 or 22 
June (i.e., right after the PRC reviews).  I need some advance warning on a 
date because I want Clay and Wayne to be there and they both have a heavy 
travel schedule to manage.

Thanks,

Rick

need to make decisions on.  Lets discuss because I have some views but am 
very open to others especially when I don't really know (first hand) what 
oppts really look like there.  We need to address quickly.

Subject: Tokyo opportunities

Hello Mike, 

I tried to call you several times yesterday but you were busy all the time. 
The reason why I called is that I have some questions that I will like your 
input on before I take a decision. I will try to call you later today but 
here are some of the questions.

You and Jeff talks about a senior position for me. What do you mean by that 
and what will Joe's position be. Will he still be the "president" or will he 
take a more active role on the origination side. What will Jeremy's role be. 
Today he does all these senior structuring deals with EGM products.

Focus. There are very many commodities to look at here but since we have 
limited resources at this stage we need some focus in the beginning. If we 
look at everything at once - nothing will happen.

There are two areas that looks "easy" to start with. Softs and Liquids. How 
willing are EGM to focus on these in the beginning. The reason for I call 
these areas "easy" is that there are big and very liquid liquids and soft 
markets here and it therefore will possible to do transactions early to get 
some momentum in the business. The other markets have large potential but 
will take much longer time to develop. I look at Equity/FX/Interest as 
something Darren will continue focus on.

When some of these markets start to develop and we will have some marketing 
activities/trading going on where will the books probably be and to whom will 
we report. If we do Softs will it be to Gary or will it be to Jeff. How will 
it be integrated. I have no problem with say reporting liquids etc to John 
Nowlan, Softs to Gary, weather to Mark. I think this will be a good solution 
because it will force them to follow us up and it will be easier to 
communicate strategies back and forth etc. The situation today on weather is 
something that I do not like. We have the book, but we do not have any real 
support from Houston or real responsibility. If that is the situation we will 
soon have a lot of problems. It is not a secret within Enron that the 
Singapore oil situation, coal in Asia/Australia and the weather in 
Scandinavia/Europe are not optimal. For me to take a decision I will need to 
know that there are support and willingness from all the heads of EGMs 
different commodities for developing the possibilities in this region, not 
only from you and Jeff. I do not want to use all my time fighting internal 
battles, but I know that it will be hard work to make a business grow.

Staff. In my power trading group today I have 2 managers and 9 AAs. The 
managers + 2 Asso are what I call marketing guys and the rest are analysts 
(some with trading potential). We have no one with trading background in EGM 
products so that need to be recruited. At the same time many of these AAs 
have started within the last 6 months so they are not fully Enronized so it 
would be a good idea to send over some AAs or managers to teach people models 
etc. 

You mentioned Singapore in the TC, what will happen with them?

How does EGM reward people for starting up businesses. It was almost 
impossible to get someone to help me building up the power here (both London 
and Houston). People, especially not traders, do not want to leave a 
profitable book or origination activities. Quite many got the feedback in 
last PRC that they need a number to their name, both P&L and number of 
originated deals, so they did not dare to leave. How will that be handled 
here?

I think my main strength is trading, and I prefer to do trading, but I have 
quite good origination skills. Iknow that in a start up process you need to 
do both and I am more than willing to do that. 

This was a lot of questions but to get some feedback on them are necessary 
for me to take a decision. I will probably go to London on Wednesday and 
Thursday next week to speak with Sherriff etc. I will try to call you later 
today

Regards


Morten Erik

Dear Mr. McConnell, my name is Rudy Hirschheim, and I'm the past Director
of the Information Systems Research Center at the University of Houston.
Enron is a member of our group and I was friends with Alberto Gude, Enron's
former IT Director. I have a request that I wondered if you could help with.

Perez Companc - a big oil and gas company in Argentina - is trying to
understand how some of the big US companies are dealing with IT. Basically
interested in issues such as sourcing arrangements, structure
(centralized/decentralized/distributed), customer relationships, use of
packaged software, 'e' issues, and such like. They want me to try to set up
meetings with some key US companies here in Houston. Among the companies
which I suggested they talk to is yours. Do you think someone/some group
would be willing to talk to a contingent of Perez Companc folks? Would
Enron be willing to share things which weren't considered
competitive secrets with them?? They were hoping to come up either the
first or second week in March. My role is to try to put together visits to
the Shell/Texaco JV, Shell, Texaco, Exxon-Mobil, Conoco, BHP, Enron,
Chevron. Do you think it is possible? Again, nothing of a competitive
nature has to be offered, they just are trying to determine what they ought
to be doing with respect to IT.

Thanks in advance.

Brent,
I would like this to become formal policy within EGM as well. I know that it 
exists and is around but no one is familiar with this or exactly how it 
works.   We have made strides with credibility with RAC regarding coal and we 
are doing a better job of seeing deals in general but I would like to put out 
a policy like this for us.  Please take a look at this and draft a memo that 
can be sent out addressing the approval procedures and the guidelines and 
limits around them.
Thanks,
mike

Yes, there is a formalized process.  After Credit and Legal, and in most 
cases RAC, look at transactions, a VP or higher will sign the Dash.  For Doug 
to sign the Bahamas option contract, I need to know the premium.  Please 
contact Brent Price for our DASH.  (Deal approval sheet)

Jeff,

I'm sorry to bother you with this, but I can't seem to get a straight answer 
from anyone - when one is signing a contract around here, is there a form you 
fill out for approval?  In London, everyone fills out a CACS form (Contract A
uthorisation Control Sheet), and if the deal is > $0.5m, then a DASH is 
required as well.  Brad seems to think that if a DASH is not required, then 
the business unit head signs off on the expenditure?  Is there a formalised 
global-markets process for this, or is this a product-by-product thing?  (in 
which case, I'll assume LNG has no process, and I'll direct Eric to implement 
one...)  (Doug Arnell needs to purchase his option for the Bahamas land 
thing, thus the reason for the question).

fyi, attached is European CACS form. 

Thanks,
Merritt

David, 

Thanks for the comments and updates.  I didn't know exactly how it was 
structured.   I am waiting on the revised draft from Frevert.  After I get 
that one I will circulate it to Greg for his additions for the Net Works 
pieces.  

I don't believe that we are going to add Shankman to the executive committee 
right now.  I am assuming the same is for Lavo.  There may be an appropriate 
time in the near future to make changes to the committee and they may be 
considered then. I don't think they want to add any additional people at this 
time.  Mark may have a different opinion and if he does, I am sure he will  
add it.

I do think we should add that Mark is Chairman of all the organizations.

Thanks,
Mike

I'll review first para. and get a revised version back to you. Believe Mark 
was discussing/;looking at eblow but FYI my comments on the rest are:

- Wasn't clear on emmisisons, but believe that is McGowan who reports to 
McClellan
- Tawney reports to Overdyke
- Thought Overdyke was Insurance and Weather
-  Won't Shankman also get elected to to the Exec Committee?
-  Above being case I would suggest we announce same for Lavo.
- Should we add that Frevert remains Chairman of Europe and ENA.

David

Tom,
I am fine with this but our effective date is a call of fairness that depends 
on your view of the middle east adjustment.  I don't want to be hard on this 
and get back a bigger number on middle east by default.  Its up to you and 
your judgement on what you think is appropriate and or a trade with Europe.  
I am fine with your ultimate decision.

Mike,

Attached is the proposed plan transfer to EGM for Enron Japan.  These amounts 
have been reviewed and approved by Joe Hirl.  We are still working with Enron 
Europe to gain agreement on the effective date (April 1 or July 1)  - will 
let you know as soon as this is settled.

Here's a summary of the Plan Amounts;


			 Split after 2Q 
			
			 EGM 
Margin*	1Q		                 -   
	2Q		                 -   
	3Q		      3,750,000 
	4Q		      3,750,000 
	2001		      7,500,000 
			
			
Expense	1Q		                 -   
	2Q		                 -   
	3Q		      3,366,377 
	4Q		      3,366,377 
	2001		      6,732,754 
			
			
EBIT	1Q		                 -   
	2Q		                 -   
	3Q		         383,623 
	4Q		         383,623 
	2001		         767,246 


If we end up with an April 1 transfer, EGM will be kept whole on plan (will 
be approx $3.4 MM expense, zero margin).

Please advise if you have any questions or wish to discuss this in further 
detail.

little time at home over the holidays.Congrats on the Sooners season, what
an exciting year with one big game to go. Are you going to Miami? Spoke with
Brenda last night and she said they had a great time at the big 12
championships and are planning to go to Miami for the National Championship
game. Sure wish my Horns were going, I guess we have to settle for another

Miami, I will be rooting for your Sooners (that's hard to say). Give me a

John,

A couple of thoughts to follow on from yesterday.

If your prime motivation in completing shutting down the merchant power 
effort versus turning it down is to send a strong signal to the government, 
then I believe the message will be undermined by Enron's continued efforts 
through EPower.  In order to be most effective and show commitment to the 
"message" strategy then it would be consistent to shutdown the efforts of 
EPower (something none of us believes makes sense).  While METI would 
understand that EJ reducing its efforts is significant, they will breathe a 
sigh of relief that Enron is not pulling out of power since EPower efforts 
are continuing.  As many in the market still believe that EPower will be 
marketing and retailing power as well as building power plants, it will look 
as though not much has changed regarding Enron.  In fact, many of the other 
new entrants, Marubeni, Ennet, Nippon Steel, etc have indicated to us that 
they will reduce efforts now and look to the future for further change (in 
effect exactly what we are talking about doing).  Many of these companies are 
looking at building 100 Mw stations that could be available in the next 12-18 
months.  METI is undoubtedly aware of this and is working to bring pressure 
on the utes and further development to the market structure as soon as they 
are able (timing uncertain).  In summary, I believe that you would be able to 
send the same message through reducing EJ's efforts down to a slow boil, but 
allow us to keep abreast of what is going on and pushing initiatives in the 
12-18 month range (Ahlstom initiatives, Ennet merchant power plant financing 
proposal, etc.).  Imagine EJ commercial team of approx 2 with some percentage 
of senior commercial oversight.  While not a prime motivating factor, having 
a small team working this effort will also allow us to manage the existing 
relationships with the customers.  As an aside, Air Liquide told us that they 
had been warned by their people in the US that Enron often backs out of deals 
at the last minute.  I don't bring this up as a reason to do an uneconomic 
deal, but just to give an indication of the relationship factor.  Backing out 
of this deal and reducing our power efforts are the right things to do.

You also mentioned that if Enron wanted to look at the 12-18 month type 
projects then we could accomplish this through EPower.  Based on the midterm 
deals that we have reviewed to date, I think successful accomplishment here 
is unlikely.  I think that you have been made aware of most of these issues.  
If EPower was operating in isolation, then these projects would be continuing 
without any real insight on the commodity value/risk proposition.  I believe 
that we have agreed on this point before and that value delivered for these 
types of projects is effectively 85% EJ/15% EPower.

On your suggestion of leaving this as a draft, I believe this makes real 
sense.  Also I'd like to make the announcement formal on 7 May.  Next week is 
a holiday week in Japan and therefore very few people will be here.  Also I 
imagine that Morten Erik should likely have made a decision by then so the 
note can be adjusted accordingly.  This will help with the Japanese staff as 
they will have a much better idea of what the future will look like.  
Jonathan's toing and froing a couple of months ago caused a great deal of 
anxiety amongst the staff up until he was ready to give formal notification.

I have also made a couple of comments or suggestions below as well.  I hope 
this has been helpful.

regards,

Joe

May I please have your comments if any on this draft by close of business 
Wednesday.  We hope to have agreed on the Q&A's by then and to send it out 
the announcement on Thursday.

John

To be sent to:  All Enron Europe, all employees in Japan,  all Global Markets 
and all VPs and up around the company

Enron has established several wholesale businesses in Japan in the last year 
including Metals,  Power marketing, Power Plant Development (via our 
investment in EnCom),  Coal,  LNG & Weather.   While we have been able to 
close power transactions and there is real interest from customers for 
Enron-type power solutions, Japan has not yet removed some significant 
barriers to make progress towards a full scale liberalized electricity 
market.  The regulators and key politicians are very much in favor of further 
liberalization and the benefits this would provide, but the timing in 
uncertain.  Until further tangible steps are taken to improve third party 
access for electricity in Japan, we will significantly reduce our power 
marketing efforts and focus on the significant opportunities that currently 
exist in our other wholesale businesses.   Once the necessary regulatory 
changes have been completed we expect to aggressively pursue Enron's 
traditional position as the leading buyer and seller of electricity in every 
deregulated market.  

Based on these changes Joe Hirl our President of Enron Japan will move to the 
Global Markets group and lead a team made up of Enron Japan staff that will 
focus on developing all our Global Markets opportunities in Japan especially 
Weather,  Oil,  LNG,  Coal, and Shipping.    We expect to continue our 
general recruiting  of Japanese nationals and as President of Enron Japan,  
Joe will continue to provide the overall business leadership for Enron Japan 
and this will also include recruiting and the Analyst and Associate program 
in Japan.  The Finance origination team headed by Jeremy Thirsk will continue 
to report to Joe and also move to Global Markets.  Morten Erik Pettersen is 
still evaluating possibilities inside and outside of Japan and will decide 
shortly on his direction. (if we make this announcement on 7 May as suggested 
above, then we can make the previous sentence more precise)  The 
Equity/FX/Interest rate team which is a part of Global Markets has two 
employees in the Tokyo office today and they expect to expand their efforts 
throughout the year.

The EnCom group, which is our power plant development business (with minority 
partners) and headed by Carey Sloan will continue its efforts in developing 
power plants in Japan.  We are pleased with the progress we are making on a 
number of sites and EnCom will continue to report to the Enron Europe Office 
of the Chairman.

Our Metals team headed by Kazunari Sugimoto will continue to report through 
Enron Metals in London.

By May we expect Enron Credit to have two to three employees in Tokyo pursing 
the Credit Derivative business.  These employees remain in  Enron Credit , a 
part of Enron Europe.

EBS has two employees headed by Jim Weisser and this team expects to expand 
by year end.

The Industrial Markets team also expects to have two employees in the Tokyo 
office in the next couple of months.

In the last seven months the commercial support services for Japan have been 
transitioned to London for support and this is not changing.  Jane McBride 
heads the legal team and will continue to functionally report  to Mark Evans, 
General Counsel in London.   The RAC function will continue to report to Ted 
Murphy, head of RAC for Enron Europe.   The Risk Management and Accounting 
team is headed by Jan-Erland Bekeng will continue to functionally report to 
Fernley Dyson in London.  The  IT, HR,  Tax and real estate teams will also 
continue to functionally report to London. 

Nick O'Day who heads both the Public Affairs group (Government & Regulatory 
Affairs and the Public Relations) in Japan will report to the Enron Europe 
Office of the Chair with a Public Relations functional reporting to Jackie 
Genle in London and a Government Affairs functional reporting to Rick 
Shappiro in Houston.   We anticipate that his team's efforts will be 
primarily directed to supporting the EnCom power plant development team but 
he will also continue to provide support for Global Markets, EBS & Industrial 
Markets.

We have already made considerable progress in breaking into the Japanese 
markets across a wide range of Enron businesses and we anticipate that this 
will be a major profit center for profit growth for years to come. Through 
these current changes we can demonstrate our ability to be flexible and 
target our resources where they will realise the most immediate value for the 
company.

Ken,

I had to respond.  

Speaking of bitch....all of the Cornhusker fans are bitching about Stoops 
not  taking the head coach position at the Cleveland Browns or any other job 
that will get him out of their backyard.  By the way, Stoops just started 
working on his book "OU's 7th Football National Championship"; Chapter 3, Who 
are the Huskers?

I see that we are scheduled to have lunch today.   I may have to postpone 
again, I'll let you know later this morning.  I am out all weekend and we 
have to have the final comments on the Analyst Presentation in by sunday 
night so I may be working over lunch.  Actually, I think we are in pretty

have to cancel.

Joe,  

I have been reading about ePower and potentially building sites.  I know you 
are clarifying it's activities but until then, I have instructed my guys to 
respond to ePower when they call and to discuss events (e.g.:  possible LNG 
re-gas plans for ePower) but to make sure and discuss all activities with you 
as well.

Let me know if you want something different or want me to email other 
instructions.

Thanks,

Yes, I thought it went well also.  We can find a way to get a long term 
commitment from EOTT, thus changing their organization, without taking on the 
price risk.  

On the hiring, I think that is a good idea.  If it is put in a way that due 
to the extensive growth that we expect to have, you want to be in the hiring 
loop, I don't see how people can object.  It is not a trust situation but an 
additional reference point.  We are here to help.

I think that meeting with Stan was good.  I'll push Nowlan, Schroeder, etc.

On another note, I want to send out an email to the business unit heads about 
hiring.  Obviously crucial to our business growth is more talent, I'm just 
worried we could be bringing in people on the trading side that do not 
upgrade our group.  After we feel more comfortable, and I feel good our 
assessment of talent, I'd loosen the reigns substantially.  This is driven by 
the crude and products group primarily.  Any thoughts?

Jeff, John  - this is where we need some help.  At our meeting in New 
York,several of the
presenters expressed dissatisfaction with the Products Control Group.  One of 
the 
issues in my presentation was time spreads.  Since Oct of 2000 we have been 
trying 
to put this out in Sing because it was much more liquid and carried lower 
risk than the 
flat price trading we are doing now on EOL.   PCG kept trying to force feed 
us a 
format based on US Nat Gas.  This setup would not be acceptable to our 
customers. 
In the meantime ICE beat us to the punch and started offering time spreads in 
March.  

We finally got this sorted out and now have a format ( though not the best) 
that is workable 
and able to be put on line.  However, we are dismayed to see their response 
that they
don't want to waste their time putting other products on line until they see 
some liquidity
in the one product they designed.   I may be naive but once they set up the 
one time spread
product it should be relatively easy to add additional products and or other 
types 
of spreads ( ie - quarter to quarter as opposed to month to month).

Any help is appreciated.

Hi Pat, 

The SG Dubai Time Spread has now been approved by all the relevant 
departments and will be uploaded over the weekend. 

With regards to the other products you have requested, creating time spreads 
for the Tapis, SG 180 HSFO, SG380 HSFO, SG Kero, SG Gasoil & SG Naphtha, this 
will involve creating 6 whole new product types. At this point in time, we 
have a restriction as to how many new product types we can create and we are 
currently working on numerous product launches for the other trading groups. 

Before we go ahead creating more SG product types, we do need to see more 
trading activity in order to justify having to create 6 more new product 
types. 

If you have any questions, please let me know. 

Regards 
Caroline

Subject: New Spread Functionality

All,

When you are ready, we can show you how the spread functionality will work on 
EnronOnline.  Still trying to ascertain when these products will be up and 
running.  We have a test server that can be used to test these products.  We 
are asking for spreads on the following products: Dubai, Tapis, SG 180 HSFO, 
SG 380 HSFO, SG Kero, SG Gasoil, SG Naphtha.  If there are any other time 
spread products that you guys would like, please let me know.

Thanks,

Pat

Caroline - What do we need to do to get the other product descriptions routed 
through the system?  I know that you have the Dubai description.  Also, we 
have already created the Tapis, SG 180 HSFO, SG380 HSFO, SG Kero, and we have 
the crack spread for the SG Naphtha.  Therefore, is it necessary for us to 
create all the product descriptions and forward them to you.

Mike,

Just wanted to close the loop with you on this topic.  Attached is a brief 
conclusion and recommendation memo that I prepared for Eric Gonzales that 
sets out the issues I have previously briefly discussed with you.  I have 
discussed this with Frevert who is fine with it and at his request I have 
verbally advised Duke LNG of our position.  There is also a meeting scheduled 
with them on June 7 that I will be attending with Mark, so I don't think the 
letter referenced in the memo will be necessary at this point.

If you have any questions please don't hesitate to call me at X-52709.

Wendy Gramm invited Jeff Skilling to attend a social event for Senator Lugar 
(R-IN) in Dallas on Sunday, November 19th.   Jeff is going to be out of town, 
so I wanted to know if you are interested in attending on Enron's behalf?  
I'm told it's going to be a small gathering of CEOs from Texas companies.   
Senator Lugar is the Chairman of the Senate Ag Committee, which has primary 
jurisdiction over the Commodities Exchange Act legislation.   Lugar is a 
senior player on ag issues, and will be very influential in the farm policy 
debate -- which begins anew next year.    He's also involved in foreign 
relations issues, and is pro-trade.

Let me know if you're interested (and available) to attend this event, and I 
will get additional details to you asap.

Thank you.

Dear Mike, 

My name is Joseph Mathew and I used to work with Enron from 1996-1999, where 
I was last a commercial Director as of 1998.? I have worked very successfully 
with Greg Whalley, Jeff Shankman, Fred Lagrasta, John Arnold, Duane Hart, 
Amanda Martin, Harold Buchanan, among others in the past.? I had also 
authored a financial products paper with Louise Kitchens that was published 
by two European trade magazines in the spring of 1997.

I am currently a Vice President and Senior Officer of Chematch.com, a 
Houston-based online bulk petrochemical, polymer and fuel products trading 
exchange.? We founded the firm over one year ago, and things have been going 
quite well.

However, the landscape for our business model, industry market penetration, 
as well as increased competition has eroded the chance for strong revenue 
success of this company, and I wish to return to Enron, but staying within 
the dynamic, challenging high-tech areas, such as Enron Global Markets.

My responsibilities here at Chematch.com have been multiple-fold.? I have 
been directly responsible for the creation of the business strategy/plan (and 
its changes), the pro-forma financial statements and projections that 
permutate with the strategy, key strategic alliances with best of breed 
industry participants, venture capital raising process for three series of 
funding, the Investment Banking presentations/diligence/IPO work.

I currently head up all of the Chematch.com content, information and 
analytics efforts, for both cash and paper markets.? I also head up 
Petrochem.net, the sister company within Chematch.com.

Prior to joining Enron, I graduated from the University of Chicago with a 
Master of Business Administration in Analytic Finance and Accounting.? Prior 
to b-school, I worked on Wall Street for 3 1/2 years in investment banking 
and capital markets.

Attached is a copy of my resume.? My goal is to procure a challenging 
leadership position within your group in the capacity of Business 
Developement, Corporate Finance, Mergers & Acquisition, or Venture Capital.? 
I would be open to other suggestions.

Please review my resume when you get a chance.? I appreciate that you are 
very busy, but I would very much appreciate hearing back from you if you see 
a fit between what I can offer and what your group is doing.

John, 

Thanks for your outlines.  Here are a couple of others that aren't kid 
related.  The Choice is just 1 small piece but I love it.  Actually,  The 
Choice moved me so much, I sold my piece of the business (Excel)  and 
returned to Enron -  the rest is history.

Enjoy,
Mike

PS - We are way to similar!

Cindy,
I have a friend that is a principal in a company called Nexstar.  The 
company  is on a roll and offers an interesting product.  I have attached his 
email and basic presentation but I thought it was interesting enough to bring 
it up to you.  Also he is a friend and I don't want to ignore him.  Do we do 
anything like this with our employees?

I would really appreciate some feedback on this.  Unless you think it is a 
total waist of time, I would appreciate you and some other appropriate 
members of your HR team to attend 1 intro. meeting to listen to their pitch.  
I would of course attend as well if you like.  They have an impressive 
customer list already.

Let me know what you think and I'll help co-ordinate the meeting.

Thanks,
Mike

 Mike,

 It was good to talk to you this weekend and hope you had a great
stay in Dallas. As we discussed, I am attaching a brief introduction to
Nexstar Financial and a copy of our latest press release. Nexstar is a
financial services company that is currently offering mortgage lending
products. We began the company in May 1999 and have spent the last 18 months
building a state of the art high tech (web) high touch (telephone) customer
communication/service center located in St. Louis Missouri.. We specialize
in working with Fortune 500 companies to provide superior mortgage products
to their relocating employees as well as to their  general employee
population.

 Our management team of industry leaders launched Nexstar after
holding senior positions with some of the most prominent mortgage companies
in the business today. Our Chairman, Marvin Moskowitz was Chairman of the
parent company of Prudential Home Mortgage while it grew to industry
prominence in  providing mortgage products to corporate America.  Rick
Thornberry, our CEO and President, most recently held the COO and President
positions at Citi Mortgage.  I serve as Managing Director of Business
Development at Nexstar and served as Managing Director of Sales at Citi
Mortgage responsible for the Corporate Relocation and Employee Program.
Previous to Citi I served in several executive positions with Prudential
Home Mortgage.  Helen Garrity is Managing Director of Sales and Marketing.
She joined Nexstar from her position as SVP of Norwest Mortgage, where she
led the corporate and affinity mortgage programs.  Our experienced and
visionary management team has been joined by some of the brightest
individuals in the mortgage industry.  Since May 1999, our collective team
has succeeded in designing and implementing the most advanced mortgage
program available to corporations and co-brand partners today, resulting in
an easier mortgage process with reduced customer expenses and savings to the
corporation.

 I'd love to have the opportunity to meet with the appropriate people
at Enron to demonstrate the benefits Nexstar offers for Enron's relocating
and general employee population.

 Please give me a call at your earliest convenience to discuss
Nexstar and how we could bring value to Enron. Thank you.

Mike / Jeff - As a follow-up to our meeting last week, here's a summary of 
our political risk insurance on the Gaza Project:

 Insurer: OPIC

 Insured: Enron Corp & Affiliates

 Amount: Aggregate of $60M may be claimed, sub-limited for separate coverages 
as follows:

  (A) $22.5M - Expropriation (equal to the "Book Value" of Enron's investment)

  (B) $60M - Political Violence / War (excluding violence from labor strikes 
or student unrest)

  (C) $10M - Currency Inconvertibilty / Non-transferability

 Term: 20 years from July 2000; policy is non-cancellable

 Rate on Line: 100 bps pa for coverage (A); 90 bps pa for (B); 36 bps pa for 
(C)

 Certain deductibles, exclusions and waiting periods apply, according to 
industry norms; in addition, if we were to   make any expropriation claim, or 
a political violence claim where we were not going  to re-build the facility 
with the   proceeds, we would have to deliver shares representing all or a 
portion of our interest in the project to OPIC in order 
 to receive  the claim payment.  This is a problem, because the project 
shares have been pledged to the lender(s)   as part of the project financing 
security package.

As to the status at the site, the immediate crisis seems to have abated.  No 
expats are on site, but various sub-contractors are available to do work.  
The problems is transporting material and equipment to the location.  We are 
about two months behind schedule.

Cliff

THE ROAD WARRIOR REPORT - VOLUME VI, ISSUE 7 - SEPTEMBER 10, 2000 -

PRESENTED BY SOONERFANS.COM

NORMAN - The heat was down, the offense was clicking, and the Sooners  looked

much crisper in defeating Arkansas State Saturday night, 45-7, for a

pleasant 40th birthday present for head coach Bob Stoops. Josh Heupel,  who

completed 50% of his passes last week, but was inconsistent and  off-target

at times, bounced back with his usual superb showing against the Indians.

Heupel completed 24 of 32 passes (75%) for 301 yards, one interception,  and

three TDs. In the process, he tied former Sooner QB (now OU running backs

coach) Cale Gundy's career record for TD passes with 35. It took Gundy  four

years to set the record, while Heupel equaled it in only one year and two

games.

The Sooner special teams, which were solid but not spectacular against  UTEP,

had their moments against Arkansas State. The punt return game was

outstanding, as J.T. Thatcher broke Jarrail Jackson's single-game record  for

punt return yardage, set last season against Missouri. Thatcher's stellar

day included a 66-yard punt return for a TD and an interception from his

safety spot on defense.

Cathy,

Mike mentioned last week that he would send us a copy of the presentation for 
the Crude/products offsite of a couple of weeks ago.  I'd like to begin 
looking at this prior to coming over next week.  If you could forward it 
would be most appreciated.

thanks.

Christine,

I so rarely write love notes.  17 years ago it was common place, even a daily 
event.  What happened to that guy?  I could have been a cartoonist in another 
life.  

I am here at 35,000 feet 2,000 miles from Bankock Thailand, flying  by China, 
soon to be over the Philippines and pondering our lives.  You said something 
very interesting to me on the phone as I was getting on the bus to the 
airport.  You said that you would love to have 6 hours on the airplane by 
yourself.  I can certainly understand that.  I seem to have a l lot of that 
on this trip.  I am sitting here on the plane, a little tipsy after a couple 
glasses of wine, and my mind turns to you and the kids.   I wish I could be 
there now to see the kids all dressed up in their costumes ready to go out 
trick or treating.  I bet they look great.

As i sit here and feel a little sorry for myself then i come back to reality 
and realize just how lucky we really are.  I turned to Ken Rice at the 
ceremony yesterday and said, "What is an Okie and a boy from Nebraska doing 
at a Japanese barrel ceremony with Thomas Foley, former Speaker of the House, 
breaking a barrel of saki in front of 300 Japanese executives and TV.  The 
Prime Minister of Japan didn't show up and actually it is expected that he is 
out of a job on a no confidence vote last night.  (Really bad luck for Enron 
here) I would have liked to have met him.  Actually, the ceremony was neat 
and I imagine that they will have some funny pictures from it.  You should 
see me in a Happy coat.  I'll explain when i get home.  

Can you imagine sitting in our home, right after Michael was born and even 
imagining what are lives are like today?  We are so blessed.  Even more than 
that, I am so blessed to have you. I was writing in my journal on the trip 
over, you know my journal - that project that I have dedicated a big part of 
my life to and that you have never read, reflecting on our lives and 
wondering why God let me find you so many years ago.  I must have been a 
priest in a former life.

Anyway, I just wanted to say I love you and there aren't any phones on this 
airplane.  Thai Airlines, go figure. So I am calling you via email.  Although 
I am not sure when I will get the opportunity to actually send this over the 
internet.

I love you and miss you very much.

Eternally,
Michael

See you soon and in time for soccer.

xxxxxooooo

Hi Mike, 

I just wanted to follow up on the below email.? Hope all is well.

Dear Mike, 

My name is Joseph Mathew and I used to work with Enron from 1996-1999, where 
I was last a commercial Director as of 1998.? I have worked very successfully 
with Greg Whalley, Jeff Shankman, Fred Lagrasta, John Arnold, Duane Hart, 
Amanda Martin, Harold Buchanan, among others in the past.? I had also 
authored a financial products paper with Louise Kitchens that was published 
by two European trade magazines in the spring of 1997.

I am currently a Vice President and Senior Officer of Chematch.com, a 
Houston-based online bulk petrochemical, polymer and fuel products trading 
exchange.? We founded the firm over one year ago, and things have been going 
quite well.

However, the landscape for our business model, industry market penetration, 
as well as increased competition has eroded the chance for strong revenue 
success of this company, and I wish to return to Enron, but staying within 
the dynamic, challenging high-tech areas, such as Enron Global Markets.

My responsibilities here at Chematch.com have been multiple-fold.? I have 
been directly responsible for the creation of the business strategy/plan (and 
its changes), the pro-forma financial statements and projections that 
permutate with the strategy, key strategic alliances with best of breed 
industry participants, venture capital raising process for three series of 
funding, the Investment Banking presentations/diligence/IPO work.

I currently head up all of the Chematch.com content, information and 
analytics efforts, for both cash and paper markets.? I also head up 
Petrochem.net, the sister company within Chematch.com.

Prior to joining Enron, I graduated from the University of Chicago with a 
Master of Business Administration in Analytic Finance and Accounting.? Prior 
to b-school, I worked on Wall Street for 3 1/2 years in investment banking 
and capital markets.

Attached is a copy of my resume.? My goal is to procure a challenging 
leadership position within your group in the capacity of Business 
Developement, Corporate Finance, Mergers & Acquisition, or Venture Capital.? 
I would be open to other suggestions.

Please review my resume when you get a chance.? I appreciate that you are 
very busy, but I would very much appreciate hearing back from you if you see 
a fit between what I can offer and what your group is doing.

Best Regards,

Still taking in the big win.  Seems more incredible in retrospect that it
did at the time.  Stoops could name his price!

I still would like the video.  I know that J.R. would be disappointed if you
paid him for the tickets.  He gave them to me to use as I please.  Let's go
to the Tour Championship and call it even.

Jonny,

Wow what a week.  I still can't believe it.  I will have the video in mail
overnight on Monday.  Sorry for the delay.  Let me know if you got another
copy and don't need it.

Thanks again for the tickets and for driving.  It was fun being with Trey.
I hope B is feeling better and that you had a great time celebrating
Madeline's birthday.  I can't believe you have a teenager.  We are getting
old.

I was showing my ticket off this morning to everyone and someone mentioned
the price of the ticket.  $175!  I didn't realize that when you gave it to
me.  I really don't want your dad picking that up for the two of us.  I
didn't mind his hospitality at $50 bucks but i simply didn't realize they
were that much -  I 've never been to the big dance before.  If your dad
wasn't comped the tickets from OU, Mark and I would like to reimburse him.

Please let me know the situation.

Cheers and Boomer Sooner,
mike

I have attached a slightly revised version - I apologize for the delay - but 
have been very active with the market and interviews - The only number I have

All changes that I made - I have typed in bold. Please call with questions -

Mr. Alan Kent
Flair Construction Co., Inc.

RE: Proposed Unimproved Property Contract by and between Flair Construction
Co., Inc., as Seller, and Mike & Chris McConnell, as Buyer

Dear Mr. Kent:

We have read and reviewed the above referenced Contract.  On behalf of Mr. &
Mrs. McConnell we would like to make the following comments and suggestions.

Generally, our major concern is what happens if in the unlikely event Mr. &
Mrs. McConnell cannot reach an agreement with you regarding the construction
of their home?  The Homesite Reservation Agreement states that they must
sell the lots back to you as the Developer at seventy five percent (75%) of
the sales price if you, as the Builder, do not start construction within six
(6) months of the date the lots were purchased.  In such an event, Mr. &
Mrs. McConnell would lose a substantial amount of money.  Therefore, we
would like to know if you have any suggestions as to how to address this
problem.

We make the following specific comments regarding the Unimproved Property
Contract itself in chronological order.

1. Paragraph 2, Property.  As we discussed, we would like to get a copy of
the Deed Restrictions as soon as possible so as to make sure that Mr.
McConnell's house will not be atypical for this subdivision.

2. Paragraph 5, Earnest Money.  We suggest that the Earnest Money be paid to
the Title Company.

3. Paragraph 6, Title Policy & Survey, A.Title Policy (6).  In view of the
fact that The Lakes at Sterling Gate is a new subdivision, we have suggested
to Mr. & Mrs. McConnell that they request that the exception as to
discrepancies, conflicts, shortages in area or boundary lines, encroachments
or protrusions or overlapping improvements be deleted from their Owners
Policy of Title Insurance.  We understand that Mr. & Mrs. McConnell will
have to pay the additional cost for this exception to be deleted.  However,
before the Title Company will delete this exception it is necessary that a
survey of the lots being purchased be provided to the Title Company.  Do you
have or can you provide such a survey?

4. Paragraph 6, Title Policy & Survey, Notice to Seller and Buyer (6).  We
ask that this paragraph relating to your right to continue to show the
property for sale be deleted.

5. Paragraph 7, Property Condition (B).  We suggested to Mr. & Mrs.
McConnell that subparagraph one (1) be checked rather than subparagraph two
(2) reflecting that the Buyers are accepting the property in its present
condition.  Mr. & Mrs. McConnell intend on hiring an inspector and we
thought it may be a good idea for the inspector to have an opportunity to
inspect the property itself before construction.  Therefore, we ask that a
small option fee be put in to this paragraph and that Mr. & Mrs. McConnell's
inspector has thirty (30) days to check out the property accordingly.

6. Paragraph 8, Brokers Fees.  It is our understanding that Mr. Larry
Williams of Prudential, Gary Greene Realtors represents Flair Construction.
Therefore, we would ask for an affirmative statement that any brokers' fees
be paid by Flair accordingly.

7. Paragraph 11, Special Provisions.  It is written in that the closing on
these lots will be as soon as roads are in place or on March 1, 2001 which
ever is later.  However, we do not know what roads are being addressed and
think that this sentence needs far more specificity.  The second sentence
regarding Mr. & Mrs. McConnell's obligation to use Flair Homes has already
been addressed.  The third sentence regarding when construction must start
should be revised to give Mr. & Mrs. McConnell more time to hire an
architect, etc.  We would suggest one hundred and eighty (180) days.  Also,
once Mr. & Mrs. McConnell notify you that they are ready for construction we
believe you should be under an obligation to start construction thirty (30)
days thereafter.

8. Paragraph 13, Rollback Taxes.  As you know, if there was every an
agricultural, timber or other exemption on this property, this paragraph
states that any rollback taxes will be paid by Mr. & Mrs. McConnell.  We
want to make absolutely certain that no such exemptions exist.  Therefore,
if you could ask that Title Company to provide a Tax Certificate showing
that no exemptions exist before closing we would appreciate it.  If there
ever were such exemptions, we need to be made aware of that as soon as
possible.

9. Paragraph 18, Escrow.  As we indicated earlier, we believe the Earnest
Money should be paid to the Title Company.  Since the Earnest Money is in
excess of $50,000.00 and the closing date on the lots is somewhat uncertain,
we believe the Title Company should be asked to deposit the Earnest Money in
an interest bearing account and that Mr. & Mrs. McConnell should receive a
credit accordingly.

We would appreciate it if you could respond to each of our suggestions and
comments in this letter as soon as possible.  We know Mr. & Mrs. McConnell
are very much looking forward to working with you in connection with
construction of their home.

Very truly yours,



Donald S. Stirman

Mike/Jeff,

Rick and I discussed the attached analysis with Jim today. He is comfortable 
with the analysis. He does not believe we need to spend time on the Blk A 
only case. The main issue to address is terminal access at Lake Charles given 
the "open season" exercise that closes February 15th. Elba can not receive 
LNG from Oman at the current quality specifications. If you have any 
questions please give me a call or send an email. I will be on leave but my 
US mobile is on: 713/5015913.

Mike,

Previously, Fastow's group was scheduled to vacate floor 27 on the 24th of 
August.  There were a few unexpected construction problems and now the vacate 
date is September 8.

Of course we are not moving to floor 27 "as is".   I expect the rest of the 
month of September to be used for constructing floor 27 to our 
specifications.  We can probably start moving down the first weekend in 
October.  I'm requesting a very aggressive , around-the-clock, construction 
crew. 

I'll advise as necessary.

Many Thanks,

Liz

Virginia,

Hello.  I was originally inquiring about purchasing a Cross or Signac 
impressionist lithograph.  I found them and purchased both from a gallery in 
London, William Weston.  They should be delivered this week.  They are 
beautiful and will add a lot to our collection.  By the way the Lichtenstein 
is up and hanging in our formal living room and it is magnificent.  I have 
also purchased an Appel in the last month.

I am interested in several artists.  Actually, a lot.  I will be looking for 
one or more of the following.  My concept is that overtime I would like to 
own one of all the following artists and they are all depending when I find 
something that we really like.  I listed all of our (sometimes mine vs. my 
wife's favorites and priorities).  They are kind of in rank order but as I 
stated if I find the piece that I like we will purchase it.  I want signed 
and numbered.  I realize that some were not signed by the artist but it is an 
important fact in my buying decision.  I also realize that some may not have 
done any works on paper or they are outrageously expensive.  For example, I 
would like to know if Rothko or Kline did any work on paper.  

At least that is what I am thinking now.

Bonnard (colorful only)
Lautrec
Suerat (any works on paper? - I don't know that he did any)
Other impressionist or post impressionist lithos
Braque
Moore
Arp
Rouault
Modrian
Rothko
Kline
Motherwell

By the way, I am interested in re-looking at a Picasso (although we have 2) 
that your gallery had a couple of years ago.  It was a cubist piece from the 
1920s and I believe you called the technique a "push wa" (pronunciation Vs an 
attempt at the proper spelling).  It was for sale in a couple of galleries in 
SF and was about $20,000.  Is there 1 available?  Also I am still thinking 
about the Matisse we discussed before but as you can see, I have a lot of 
other artists I am interested in and it may remain on the back burner because 
we already have one.  

Thanks,
mike

Mike / Jeff -

Please find attached a copy of the slide presentation Eskom (the state owned 
utility in South Africa) will give to the Minister of Energy in early Dec.  
Eskom, as a state owned entity, is involved in the development of the Black 
Economic Empowerment mines (ie New Coal) as well as the traditionally 
white-owned Junior Miners.  Eskom is a strong proponent of the expansion of 
Richards Bay Coal Terminal or alternately the development of South Dunes Coal 
Terminal.

As the Eskom presentation details, Enron is included in their plans to expand 
their role in the RSA coal business regardless of which terminal is 
developed.  Project Springbok is moving along well, and should result in 
increasing flows from South Africa next year.  As a note Tom Kearney (London) 
and Ivan van Niekerk (Joburg) have led this effort.  Ivan is with Enron 
Metals, but it seems we have been able to borrow him on a virtual full time 
basis - he has been great.

Subject: Eskom

George,

Eskom is presenting the attached document informally to the SA Minister of 
Energy over the weekend.   Iscor has approved the concept (but don't know 
Enron is behind it) and the Eskom Enterprises 
Board has approved it (who do know we are behind the concept).

Under the structure of the transaction, in exchange for providing the same 
throughput guarantees as other SDCT members, Enron would be allocated up to 2 
mta of the expanded RBCT allocation in perpetuity.  For a limited period 
(Francois mentioned 5 years), Black Economic Empowerment coal projects 
approved by Enron/Eskom/Govt. would have first call on the Enron 
allocation.     In addition, if it so chooses, Enron would be responsible for 
marketing the BEE coal in export markets.  Enron would become a full-fledged 
member of the SDCT and would be represented on the RBCT Board by an SDCT 
representative (which could be Enron as well).  

Bottom Line:  This is our informal invite to the dance.  RBCT is supposed to 
formally communicate with SDCT about expansion on December 6.  On December 7 
the SDCT interest group meets.  Shortly after that, Eskom will make this 
proposal to government on a formal basis and then, if Government and SDCT 
members approve, Enron will be invited to join the SDCT as a formal member.  

Let the games begin!

FYI, this morning I confirmed with Jody Crook (currently an analysist in

I have attached the latest draft of the coal presentation for the Coal Market 
Strategies Conference in Scottsdale.  I am still waiting on an updated 
version of the bar chart on page 13 from the folks up in EOL.  I am also 
forwarding this draft on to Janet Gellici the woman organizing the 
conference.  I told her on the phone and in my email that this was only a 
draft, and we will have the final version for her by the end of business on 
Thursday.  Let me know of any further changes you would like to make.

Thanks,

Mike,

I was talking to a member of the NYMEX Board and he thinks he can get JDF a 
$5,000 to $10,000 donation from the NYMEX. I will coordinate with Cathy and 
we will submit a request to the NYMEX and he will push the process. His name 
is Rich Schaeffer and he is the NYMEX Treasurer and works at ABN AMRO in NY.

Doug

We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change=
s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=
=20
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit=
y=20
for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=
orth=20
America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=
=20
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=
he=20
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=
=20
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=
=20
will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =
of=20
the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=
ness=20
into Enron Global Assets in the near future.
=20
Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined=
=20
EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi=
ll=20
focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to=
=20
the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE=
S=20
to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or=
der=20
to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20
facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for=
=20
at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout=
h=20
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=
=20
businesses and the commercial support functions:

Enron Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=
 and=20
CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20

Enron Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for=
=20
operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20
marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=
t=20
into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility=
=20
for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20
Americas.

Enron Europe
The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust=
ralia=20
and Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=
=20
Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.

Enron Global Markets
Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=
=20
CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20
responsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20
exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20
associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to=
=20
Enron Global Assets.  Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the=
=20
commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20
equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM=
ahon,=20
President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=
y,=20
the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in=
=20
the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=
=20
efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=
=20
EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These=
=20
newly defined roles are as follows:

Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=
e=20
Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works,=
=20
with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20
President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat=
ed=20
services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these=
=20
services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=
=20
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=
=20
for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.
Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.
Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =
on a=20
regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in=
=20
the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all=
=20
European and Eastern Hemisphere operations.  Rick and Mark will also contin=
ue=20
to support all other Enron businesses operating in their respective regions=
=20
and will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chi=
ef=20
of Staff.
Public Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a region=
al=20
basis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity,=20
Enron Net Works, and Enron Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue=
=20
in her role for Enron Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble=
r=20
will have responsibility for activity outside North America and Europe as=
=20
well as providing support for Enron Global Markets and Enron Global Assets.=
 =20
These individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship=
=20
to Mark Palmer, Vice President of Communications.
Business Analysis and Reporting =01) Wes Colwell will expand his role to co=
ver=20
EWS reporting in addition to his current role in North America.

Attached for your review is an organization chart for Enron Wholesale=20
Services which summarizes the changes described here.  As this organization=
=20
continues to evolve we will keep you informed of any additional changes.

ENRON GLOBAL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION
AND ENRON WIND

 As part of our company-wide initiative to examine our assets and investmen=
ts=20
around the world, we are considering a variety of options with respect to=
=20
EGEP and EWC.  As a consequence, we are putting these businesses under Clif=
f=20
Baxter=01,s direction.  Jeff Sherrick, CEO of EGEP, and Jim Noles, CEO of E=
nron=20
Wind, will report to Cliff.

CORPORATE STAFF

 We are consolidating the corporate staff functions: Human Resources,=20
Government Affairs, Public Relations/Communications and Administration.  In=
=20
that regard, Cindy Olson, Executive Vice President of Human Resources and=
=20
Community Relations, will report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President an=
d=20
Chief of Staff.

COMMITTEE STRUCTURE

 In light of the increased leadership opportunities created by Enron=01,s=
=20
growth, the Executive Committee will be expanded to include more of our=20
business unit leaders.  The primary role of this committee will continue to=
=20
be the communication of relevant information across Enron=01,s businesses a=
nd=20
the coordination of activities across those businesses.  We will also be=20
drawing on this group to lead company-wide initiatives such as the=20
performance review process and evaluation and creation of new businesses. =
=20
The Executive Committee membership is shown on the attached list.

 We are also forming a new committee =01) the Enron Corporate Policy Commit=
tee. =20
This group will be responsible for overall corporate policy, personnel=20
management policy and corporate strategy.  The Enron Corporate Policy=20
Committee membership is also shown on the attached list.

 We are confident that these changes will align our talent and our capital =
to=20
our highest return opportunities.  Please join us in congratulating and=20
supporting all of these individuals in their new roles.

BHP has advised that they will not pursue the Vulan (Project Fireball) 
opportunity.  They intend to concentrate on completing their merger with 
Billiton, and settling issues in Indonesia and China.

We will continue to look at Vulcan independently - and evaluate the need (if 
any) for a partner down the road.

Note to coal guys - Dave Murray (ex Billiton) will run the thermal group and 
Bob Kirkby (ex BHP) will run the coking coal group for BHP Billiton - both to 
be located in Melbourne.  Mike Oppenheimer will be doing something outside of 
the coal group.

Mr. McConnell,

This is Jason Stirman, Don Stirman's son.  I e-mailed you my resume a few
weeks ago, and you sent it to a couple people from Enron.  I haven't heard
back from anyone yet, so I was wondering if you knew of someone I could
contact to follow up?  Thanks again for your help.

William,

I am very interested in both the Signac and Cross.

A few  questions about the pieces.  You referenced Meier Graefe for "Pan" for 
both pieces.  I don't know what that means could you please clarify?  Also I 
don't understand the reference to an Album.  Is the Signac numbered?  Are 
either signed on the stone?

Thanks,
mike

Dear Mr McConnell

Thank you for your e-mail of the 20th October. I apologise for the slow
reply but I was travelling when it was received at the gallery.

I now have 'pointillist' colour works by Cross and Signac which might be of
interest to you. Both are from the collection of one of my clients.

The Signac is similar to the work that you liked on the website. The
details are:

Paul Signac Le Soir - Evening Jetty at Flessingue
Original lithograph in five colours. 1898. From the issued edition,
commissioned and issued by Meier Graefe for the album 'Pan', Berlin 1898.
Drawn and printed at the studio of Clot, Paris 1897/98. Ref: Kornfeld and
Wick Paul Signac Prints no 20, as completed and issued. Exceptionaly fine
and fresh impression with totally unfaded colours. On off-white chine
volant paper. Full margins. Image: 8 x 10 3/8ins. o2500 (US$ 3750)

There is no illustration of the Cross on the website. If you do not know
the image then we could arrange for a printout in colours to be sent to you
by Fedex (we do not currently have scan available for e-mail) but we would
need your full mailing address.

The details are as follows:

Henri Edmond Cross - In the Champs Elysees. Les Nourrices.
Original lithograph in colours. 1898. Numbered in pencil from the very
scarce de-luxe edition of 75 impressions. Prior to the regular issued
edition for the album. Commissioned and issued by Meier Graefe for 'Pan,

condition. Image: 7 7/8 x 10 1/4ins. o 2500 (US$3750)

I will look forward to hearing from you. Thank you for your interest in my
gallery

William Weston.

Cyber Squat
We are still in the process of acquiring control over Enron-related website 
names in the region. Our latest discovery is that enrondirect.com.br is 
registered by someone else. We are involving Legal where needed.
Website
Website back on schedule for launch on 08/28. Content approval and site 
building in progress.

Procurement Portal for the Brazilian Power Sector
Ongoing meetings with Elektro in the process of checking basics and defining 
business models.
EnronOnline
According to Scott Mills, the back office administration for Brazilian trade 
generated by EnronOnline will be spreadsheet based. The main reason is that 
the operation so far lacks scale to justify the implementation of more 
sophisticated tools, such as Enpower and Sitara It is also unclear whether 
these applications will support the types of trade identified. The idea is to 
convert to more professional tools after an initial period of evaluation and 
growth in volume.
EnronDirect
We have established contact with Debbie Edwards of EnronDirect in the UK. We 
will be working with her to evaluate similar initiatives in Brazil and 
Argentina.
Meetings
We finally managed to setup a discussion with Ideiasnet on ags. We will also 
be meeting with local investment players in e-business.

I've pulled together some general ideas on marketing within ENE and how it 
would ideally be structured for GRM.

Marketing & Origination Model

For GRM, our success is entirely dependent on a developing a team of 
dedicated marketers who specialize in delivering insurance risk management 
solutions to clients. The business model is a risk aggregation play 
(gathering first loss and co-share pieces of insurable risks we understand). 
We risk impairing our ability to create a portfolio of risks that can be 
managed, repackaged and placed in the capital or insurance markets at large 
if we don't have direct influence over the deal flow being generated. To 
accomplish this my ideal marketing/origination model working with other Enron 
business units would be:

Client Originator: Centralized in a long term origination team in ENA, EGM, 
EIM (as opposed to midmarket function) with industry specific expertise, e.g. 
oil    & gas, power, coal, forest products, etc. The CO would be responsible 
for maximizing client profitability for Enron in an investment banking 
capacity, making sure we have an inside track to the client's strategic 
initiatives/business opportunities and making sure we package complete 
solutions using  all ENE product areas. The CO also needs a financial 
incentive (see below) to take responsibility for making sure each individual 
product area is servicing the client where possible, particularly when a 
package solution is not viable, e.g like outsourcing. The CO should be 
involved with all product marketing calls if possible, but would not act as 
gate keeper, rather act more as a control valve creating a steady flow of 
ideas, products and services to the client.

Product Marketer: Centralized in a product marketing team, with industry 
knowledge and product specific expertise. While the PM will call on clients 
for      independent origination of new business opportunities, ideally the 
bulk of the opportunities should be marketing to clients identified by the CM 
to have a need for GRM's products or services. The marketing is done in 
partnership with the CO, but the driver of the transaction would be the PM. 
Execution would be handle by the PM's business unit with a portion of 
revenues devoted to the CO for their origination of the opportunity. However, 
if a particular group or CO  does not play ball or does not generate any 
business leads, the PM would still be free to originate business 
independently.

Shared Resources Centralized in a group like Fundamentals, Research, Weather 
Desk, etc. Especially useful in upstream where the deals require extensive    
engineering work and technical support. We currently use Walt Hamilton, 
Senior Reserve Engineer who works for Craig Fox in Enron Capital Resources, 
not full-time but nearly full time. Once we have a few deals booked, an 
engineer will also need to maintain the position by reviewing the reserves on 
a regular basis. I would envision having Walt on our payroll, working for us 
but remaining part of a resource pool that could be shared depending on deal 
flow and priorities set by Craig. 

Shared P&L  Tough to implement, but unless there is a real financial 
incentive, CO's will naturally focus on deals they originate and the earnings 
stay in their group.  I've worked with splits ranging from 80/20 if we do all 
the work and it is a simple referral, to 50/50 if the transaction opportunity 
is further developed by the time we get involved, typically as part of a 
structured package solution.

This is best case, but in case you're wondering, I haven't lost my senses. 
Enron is not currently the ideal company to take this approach and I don't 
believe GRM is the ideal guinea pig to make the change. Some hybrid solution 
is probably better for us, tailoring the effort based on the particular group 
we work with. In the case of EGM business units, I think this is the way to 
go since we can influence our own people. In the case of ENA or other Enron 
companies, we need to be more selective, with the worst case being we go it 
alone and duplicate efforts. This is the path we're on today with ECR's 
upstream business, however it is not how we are proceeding with EIM where we 
are trying to build bridges with forest products and steel, or ENA's power 
desk, where we have the double trigger product for them to market.

Soap Box

A little background and my general view of marketing at Enron after nearly 3 
years here. In my banking career I've worked both as a relationship manager, 
marketing all the bank's product areas to a targeted client base, as well as 
a product specialist working with a relationship manager to service that 
client base and execute product specific business. Our competitors, whether 
investment banks or commercial banks, seemed to have a similar setup, 
although they varied in design from broad geographical marketing assignments 
to industry specific assignments.  For me, this type of marketing and 
origination setup was easy to leverage, meaning my product specialist teams 
could hire the best and remain small and efficient.

Enron is the first company I've worked for that doesn't have a coordinated 
origination and  marketing approach to clients. Instead, the culture here is 
clearly based on free access to all clients, i.e. no gate keepers, no 
ownership of the client and hence no one individual accountable for 
maximizing the profitability of business closed with a client. Several 
different product/trading areas can all call on the same client with little 
or no coordination and have no game plan to maximize profitability. A clear 
benefit of not having relationship managers is speed to market with new 
products and new ideas combined with specialist knowledge about the product 
or service being sold. (In fact, I believe this has been a direct contributor 
to our ranking as the most innovative company in America.) A clear drawback 
is duplication of effort and weak implementation of cross-selling.....given 
lip-service by most marketing and origination teams I have worked with. 
Nevertheless, given Enron's successful track record, it appears the benefits 
outweigh the drawbacks and it is a system I've comfortably adjusted to.

Enough of the soap box. Just wanted to share my general Enron marketing 
thoughts and a little of my bias.

I don't know if this was specific enough for you so let me know if you need 
more detail. Consider this part of a dialogue.

New Name?

I'm also exploring alternative names for the group that identify our role 
more readily.  What do you think of the name Insurance Risk Management Group 
or Insurance Risk Management Solutions?   The latter ties into Enron's new 
way of describing its business activities...Logistical Solutions. I met with 
Dennis Vegas to discuss branding and general marketing of our activities and 
he said Logistical Solutions will be in our annual report and a major theme 
going forward. 

Hope you had a nice holiday. Speak to you next week.

Greg,

I received request for our goals on a voicemail while coming back from 
Venezuela.  I didn't know exactly what you  were looking for or the audience 
but i have listed a few initial goals and thoughts for each business unit.  
We are in the process of creating more specific goals for each group for 
2001.  Each already has their own but they are not in a final and consistent  
format.  We have an off-site meeting later this month in which we will 
address this as a group.  In addition, George and the coal group completed 
theirs late last week and Mark Tawney is returning tomorrow with re-defined 
goals as part of the process.

Also, I have attached some new global formats that I received as I was 
leaving the country on some specific items that we need to insure a 
successful year.  Most of this information has never been put together 
before.  I have projected out a 50% growth factor as a starting point and 
will break this down to specific groups and goals to insure that we will meet 
these goals.  As you know a lot of this was started when I put together the 
EGM presentation and gathered information for the analyst meeting.  

Let me know if you need something else or if this is not what you are looking 
for.

Mike

Kurt,

I spoke to Ken roughly a month ago regarding our desire to have a terminal on 
the west coast.  His initial impression was that given the climate there for 
new build asset approvals this would be extremely difficult.  He preferred 
the Mexico import idea.  Before we ask Ken to get involved I think we need at 
least a skeleton of a project.

Jody Crook & I met this afternoon with Robert Neustadter to review Socal 
storage tariffs.  Robert explained that he had been working flat out to 
prepare materials for Ken Lay who left this morning with Jeff Dasovich to 
meet with senior government officials in California to discuss solutions to 
the energy crisis.

Might be an opportunity to drop the message that we are working on LNG 
solutions and hope to get the politicians support when we make definitive 
proposals?

Mike,

Per our conversation at the Mgmt. Conf. thank you for everything you have 
done for the group and for me. 

I hope you have regained your voice and that the McConnell family has a great 
Thanksgiving holiday. 

Congrats on your JDF efforts. You should be very proud of your fundraising 
for such a worthy cause.

After your Sooners beat KSU again are you going to the Orange Bowl?

I am planning to meet with Shankman next week to discuss my contract or lack 
there of. It seems to have been on the back burner for the last two months. 

Happy Holidays,
Doug

Subject: Jose Project - Venezuela Visit

Mike, Jeff and Eric,

With the recent change of the President of PDVSA and the already announced 
departure of the Minister of Energy and Mines in January, there has been a 
significant amount of noise in Venezuela with respect to export projects in 
general.  I believe it is critical for very senior Enron people to make a 
direct pitch to the President of the country as soon as we can arrange one.  
We need to let the President know directly the benefits of the project and 
the strong commitment of Enron to the development of the project.  We have 
alreday done this several times, but it is time to do it again.

I recommend a visit in early January of maybe Frevert or you Mike (maybe 
both). We can also use this visit to have meetings with the new President of 
PDVSA and, hopefully, if there is an official Minister appointed with the new 
Minister.  It is not easy to fit in the President's agenda, so please advise 
the course of action and tentative dates.

Thanks,

Emilio

Hi Paula -

Mike McConnell has again asked me to send you a message on his behalf.  We 
have received your message below to Zina and then also a message from Carrie 
Shapiro on the same conference.  George Wasaff, MD for Strategic Sourcing, 
spoke at one of these conferences recently and Mike said that he would like 
to have the conference organizers continue to contact George for future 
conferences.  I will pass this information along to both Zina and Carrie.

Again, let me know if you have any questions.  Thank you.

Cathy Phillips for 
Mike McConnell

Zina,

Thank you for the information here and the followup phone message.  
Regrettably, I won't be able to participate in the aspect of giving a paper 
at your Conference.  Please keep us in mind for the future.  We will, 
however, be very interested in having staff attend.

I suggest that you consider contacting Mike McConnell at Enron Corp to 
discern an interest in a speaker from his group.
Thank you again.

Sincerely,
Paula

Billy,

I like it.  My only suggestion is to put in a statement like - that after all 
your discussions with business unit head and AAs  we are (changing) improving 
the program on the suggestions that you all wanted to see.  I think this 
could help everyone believe they were a part of the changes personally.

Just an idea, I like it very much as it is.

Good luck,
m

Oman LNG is now taking a 5-person delegation, including 2 relatively high 
level government officials, to Bombay to have dinner with DPC on Friday and 
to meet formally on Saturday.  The Denton Hall lawyer that represented Oman 
in the LNG negotiations, will also be there.

Clay is in Australia and cannot attend, but I will be there for both the 
dinner and the meeting to manage/referree the discussions.  I will return 
Saturday night and will visit Adgas/Adnoc on Sunday to update them.

Ron,

Thanks for the great news.  Also thanks so much for the gifts that I just 
received.  I wrote you a separate note on Friday, but I wanted to thank you 
again. The car is great and it arrived in a time of chaos and was a very 
pleasant distraction.

I am gathering information on my BMW so that I can sell that to the 
dealership at the same time I pick up my new car.  I will have all my lease 
information with me.  I have a few months left on the lease and will have all 
the needed information to complete the transaction.  If you would, please 
forward this to or let me know who I should deal with at the North side 
dealership.  I don't want another Bob Brooks situation to occur.  Also I 
don't want him dealing with the purchase of my BMW since I believe he is in 
that part of the dealership now.   I expect a fair price for my car and with 
our history, I don't want him involved in pricing my car.  I am confident 
that someone else will be better to deal with and will give me a fair deal 
with my cash purchase for the CL.  I guess I just need a name at the 
dealership. 

Thanks,
mike

Mike:
I am in San Francisco on a short vacation (wife's Zurich, Switz. high school 
reunion).  However, I made a call this am to the Jacksonville, FL port and 
your car has arrived.  They could not give me any details yet as they are in 
the process of surveying (inspecting) all the cars that came off the ship 
whch is stanadard operating procedure.  Since your planned trip is in October 
and today is 9/8, I have to assume that you should be in your car by then.  
While I know what "assume" means, I also know that the port will not release 
any car until they have inspected it and have determined that it has no flaws 
(ie. scratched bumper that may have happened on the ship).  So, while I 
really cannot give you a 100% guarantee as to when you will receive your car, 
I do believe you should be fine for your trip to Dallas.  At times, it's a 
frustrating procedure, but in the end it is the correct way to deliver a MB 
and especially this type of car.
Ron

Ron,

I'm back in the office today and was of course thinking about my car.  Did
we make the dates you referenced earlier?  I have a weekend in Oct. that
will require a drive to Dallas to meet many of my old school friends and
was wondering if I would have the car.  Also, I have an extensive
international travel schedule coming and I can schedule around a possible
delivery date.

Thanks,
mike

Today, I submitted a brief summary of each groups 2001 goals.  I wasn't able 
to talk to you before putting these out but they were fine for step one.  
Please review  and make any changes you wish to them.  I also need you to add 
as many specifics as possible.  For example number of transactions, $ 
amounts, etc.  Please read and make the changes on this email and return to 
me asap.  Keep your goals to no more than 5.

Gary,

Below is some information that might be of assistance to you.  I don't think 
that I sent this to you when I got it.  If I did please ignore this.  D'Arcy 
Carroll (works for us in S. America) came to us from Cargill and knows a lot 
of people there.  He has a couple of names that I have passed on internally 
for consideration but I am sure they didn't go to the right place.  On a 
recent trip to Sao Paulo, many of the ag products came up in meetings as good 
opportunities for Enron to go in and change that industry.  Coffee, Orange 
Juice, grains and sugar were brought up a lot.

D'Arcy may have traded an ag book for Cargill, I can't remember.

Anyway, I am passing this message and names on to you for consideration.  A 
phone call to D'Arcy might also be worth a few minutes of your time.  He 
knows a lot about Cargill and has an opinion on how to capture their markets.

Mike

Mike,  please find attatched 2 resumes, as mentioned. 

1. Rob Tesar.  Position: Enron Networks, Agricultural Markets.  Rob Tesar is 
American and has worked for 15 years at Cargill, the first 10 or so inside 
the  grains businesses where he managed the central hedging desk out of 
headquarters.   He is a class act; if he has any weakness it would be a 
tendency to  be too cautious.   He is significantly underutilized in his 
present position.

2. Detlev Hartman.  Position: open.  Detlev is German and was my boss at DG 
BANK in Frankfurt, in the early stages of the development of the finanical  
derivatives markets in Germany in the late 80's.  His professional background 
is diverse with a pretty consistent emphasis on finance.   Detlev is one of 
the  brightest, intuitive minds I've ever worked with; he could contribute in 
the MG initiative or in any number of trading, risk management oversight 
positions.   Somewhat volatile personality, but exciting to work with.

Daudi Lelijveld.  Position: Enron Networks, MG or logistics.  Daudi is a 
dutchman with a broad background; he has run Cargill's UK metals business for 
the last 5 years, or so.  He is putting his resume together and I'll forward. 

Paul Lichter and Mike Walden.  Position: IT - I have forwarded information to 
Jahn Pavetto.

The Stanford Business School, in collaboration with the management-consulting 
firm McKinsey & Company, is conducting a large study of global corporations, 
their management practices, and organization.  Enron is participating in the 
project in order to learn how our own practices and activities compare to 
those of other leading global firms and to see which bring true benefits in 
the global marketplace.  One of the unique features of the project is that it 
seeks to assess the knowledge and communication networks within a company by 
asking employees throughout the company to comment on their actual practices 
and experience.  The goal is to obtain real and accurate information by 
surveying the people most directly involved in the company's operations. 

I would like to ask you to help us in getting the most out of our 
participation in the GLOBE Initiative by completing the GLOBE Network 
Survey.  The survey is brief and should take no longer than 15 or 20 
minutes.  Your responses will be treated as strictly confidential, and will 
be used solely by the Stanford/McKinsey researchers to evaluate how specific 
practices and structures impact global communication and knowledge flows.  If 
you would like individual feedback on how your own networks compare to those 
of others in the study, please check the appropriate box at the end of the 
survey.  

Please save this email for future reference and, again, thank you for 
contributing to this important learning opportunity.

To complete the GLOBE Network Survey, please click on the link below and 
simply follow the survey instructions.  You will need to enter the Enron 
Company Code, which is: 

C673EV

To begin the survey, click on the link below:

Thank you.

Cathy:

 I spoke to the Outlook migration team and they have added you, Yolanda 
Martinez, and Mike McConnell to the Outlook Migration schedule for the night 
of Monday, June 11th.  I am copying Gary Bode so that he has plenty of notice 
regarding the public folders and other requirements you have discussed.

 Also, I have put a ticket in to have the Outlook team look into your 
addressing problem.  In the meantime, if someone sends a message to your 
internet address (Cathy.Phillips@enron.com), it will still go through, even 
from within Enron.


Thanks!

Subject: Sempra

I left you a voice mail regarding Sempra and Kinder Morgan.  Details as 
follows:

We will make a revised settlement offer to Sempra by the end of this week.  I 
doubt that Sempra will accept our offer.  If they fail to accept, we will 
head into a litigation track - which means no synfuel will be produced at 
Pier IX until the court decides on who wins the case.  We expect the case to 
go to court in the fourth quarter of this year.

As I previously advised, Kinder Morgan has been very patient with us during 
this process.  At some point in time we will have to address their claims, 
which by definition will have to go through us in order to reach Sempra.

Let me know if I can provide any additional information.

George

John,

I just realized that I didn't return your call on Friday.  I ran out of the 
office on Friday after two difficult days and had Cathy collect all my stuff 
for my trip.  Jeff and I landed in Singapore last night at 1am (it is odd 
leaving for the airport on Sat. morning and arriving on Monday morning) and 
are in the office for a while this afternoon.  I'll give you a call a little 
bit later.  If your call is urgent, please don't hesitate to give me a 
voicemail if our time zones don't match up.
Thanks and sorry for the delay.

Mr. Steimer -

Mike McConnell has been on several trips over the last few weeks and he has 
asked me to contact you on his behalf.  He asked me to pass along his 
sincerest apologies for not getting back to you on your invitation sooner.  
Due to his heavy travel schedule, he is unavailable to attend the Shell 
Houston Open.

However, Mike asked that I pass along to you my phone and e-mail information 
so that you may contact me to schedule the meeting to discuss LNG projects.  
My e-mail address is cathy.phillips@enron.com and my phone number is 
713-853-6898.  Please feel free to contact me at your convenience.

Thank you.

Subject: Lunch Meeting

Dear Mr. McConnell,

Bob Lewis and I would like to met with you to discuss Enron's developing
LNG projects, and how CB&I can assist with your efforts.

Bob is Senior VP Sales, and is CB&I's corporate sponsor for Enron.  I am
directly responsible for working with Enron on LNG projects.

As you may know, CB&I recently purchased the assets of PDM Engineered
Construction, who designed and constructed          the EcoElectrica LNG
Import Facility.  CB&I is currently constructing the AES regas terminal, in
the Dominican Republic, among other ongoing LNG projects.

CB&I is very interested in working with Enron on such projects, in
particular the Jose, Venezuela, and Bahamas projects, as well as others you
are considering.

Are you available to meet with us over lunch on Monday April 9?  Alternates
dates for us are Tuesday April 10 and Friday April 13.  Hopefully we can
get together with you on one of those dates.

Please advise your availability.

Thanks and regards,

Jeff Steimer
Vice President, LNG Sales
CB&I

Virginia,

We didn't have any interest in the piece.   I am interested in the following 
lithos.  1. a signed Bonnard (no black and whites) and 2. a Toulouse LeTrec 
(awful spelling).  Let me know if you locate some choices on those two.

Thanks,

Allan,

Would you please contact this guy and see what he wants.  We need to 
follow-up because his dad is on the board with me for JDF and he was the 
number  2 guy at Compaq with Rod Canion.  He is a Ken Lay buddy as well.  
Please find out if there is any synergies here and if not please simply 
respond and say thanks no thanks.  We just don't want him to think that Enron 
blew him off.

Thanks and i hope it is not a waste of time.

Mike

additions, changes (and/or corrections) that you believe are appropriate and

Chris,

Hello from Houston.  I really enjoyed meeting with you last Saturday at your 
gallery.  Your collection of work is very impressive.

I have not received your digital pictures that you were putting together but 
I did talk with my wife about the Bonnard.  The Bonnard is my first choice of 
all the pieces we discussed.  I found an illustration of it on the net (from 
another gallery) and she liked (although - not as much as me).  I am prepared 
to purchase a Bonnard and the Radiator is my first choice.  I would like to 
establish a relationship and do business with your gallery and would like to 
know what is your best price for the piece.  I will not shop the price around 
and will make a quick decision with a credit card number.   When I get your 
response and if it is competitive, I'll confirm the purchase when I pick up 
the email.

Thanks,
Mike McConnell

PS - I will hold off on the others for now and when you send me the pictures 
I will show them to my wife for consideration.  I am considering the Mary 
Cassat as a gift for her.

John,

This is a follow-up to our earlier discussion.  I would like to have you lay 
out our physical crude needs to become a player a long with some action steps 
to accomplish the goal.  I don't want to forget about this because I believe 
it may be something we need to assign someone or a mid-market or originator 
or team to accomplish.  I would like to see foreign and domestic.  
I see this as one of our possible competitive advantages or at least to solve 
the problem of not being in the know and getting second hand info or 
pricing.  

Thanks,
mike

Mark and David,

Below is my first stab at the organization memo.  I didn't over focus on 
specific wording and I am not sure how you want to address the various groups 
that will be affected.  I believe we need to address all of them by name and 
they should probably be in alpha order as to not upset anyone on the order.

I also didn't know any other information that you may want to include with 
regard to the successes from the group year to date.  
Greg, Jeff and I are getting together for lunch tomorrow to discuss the New 
Works organization.  

I think that this should come from Enron's office of the Chairman vs. the 
business units because it does affect 2 different lines of business and it 
will have more impact and clarity for the other groups especially, my 
departure from Net Works.

After you guys pretty this up (and destroy it) please send it back via email 
and i'll make sure and coordinate with Whalley.

Thanks,
Mike

Please distribute the following message to Enron - Worldwide and please use 
the Office of the Chairman - Enron Net Works letterhead.  Mike McConnell has 
requested that this message be returned for final review and then sent to 
Enron - Worldwide this evening.  Please call me at X-36898 if you have any 
questions.  Thank you.  Cathy Phillips


Effective immediately, reporting responsibility for Global Strategic Sourcing 
(GSS) will move from Enron Net Works to Enron Corp.  George Wasaff, managing 
director, will report directly to Rick Causey, executive vice president and 
chief accounting officer for Enron.  GSS, formed February 1, 2000, will 
continue to focus on supply-chain management world-wide for Enron.   We 
believe this change in reporting will leverage and enhance GSS's global reach 
and effectiveness while allowing ENW to focus on its core mission of creating 
new electronic market places.

Mike: You can certainly count on my support.  My son Brandon Johnson was 
diagnosis with JD when he was 11 years old.  Needless to say my family was 
traumatised by the event, however my son handled it like a trooper.  He is 
now 16 years old and has very good days with his blood sugar, but then he has 
his bad ones as well.  I have walked since he was first diagnosed with JD and 
will continue to provide my support.

Thx

Wanda

It is my sincere honor to once again lead the Enron team in this year's 
Juvenile Diabetes Foundation (JDF) walk scheduled to take place on Sunday, 
November 5, 2000, at the Sam Houston Race Park.  I continue to serve on the 
board of JDF representing Enron and will be Enron's corporate executive for 
this year's fundraising efforts.

As many of you may already know, I am an insulin dependent diabetic myself.  
Even though I know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the 
multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day, I cannot 
imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease.  Taking 
insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of 
complications; insulin is simply their life support system and without it 
they would die.

Enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for JDF again this year.  JDF 
is a very efficient organization in which approximately 84% of all money 
raised goes directly to research.  Enron's goal this year is to raise 
$225,000 and we need your help.  Enron has been the number 1 walk team for 5 
years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place!  We need team 
leaders, walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal.  The theme for the 
walk this year is "Knock Out Diabetes" and we would like to have you join us 
for this great event.  The Walk is truly a blast and we had about 500 Enron 
people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it.

If you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader, or if 
you would like to make a pledge, you may call any of the steering committee 
members listed below.  If you are interested in being a team leader, please 
contact one of the following people immediately so that you may be included 
in the first important and informative training session taking place this 
week.

Thank you very much for your support.

Just wanted to let you guys know, that while on a family vacation last week
in Red River, New Mexico, the youngest sister on John & David Denner was
killed while driving one of those 4-wheel motor bikes. I guess John had to
hold on to her lifeless body for about an hour until help could reach the
spot on the mountain where she had the accident. I spoke to John on Saturday,
and at that point he seemed to be handling it well. The funeral is tomorrow.

Dear Mr. McConnell,

After reading this mornings Wall Street Journal article with interest, I
thought it appropriate to write you, introducing our firm to you and our LNG
facilities.

Coincidently, we had talked to our friends at Vinson and Elkins a few weeks
ago about an introduction to the right person in Enron to discuss our LNG
projects with.

I am sending by courier hard copies of the items attached to this e-mail.

We look forward to meeting you, and discussing the LNG opportunities in
greater detail.


Yours faithfully,


Steve Meheen

Subject: Interactive Energy; Jeff Skilling and Interactive Texas introduction


Mike,

I'm putting together the keynote session for Interactive Energy and wondered
if you'd be available on Tuesday morning between 8-11, October 24, at the
Houston Adam's Mark.  It'll give you an excuse to sleep late in your own
bed!

I envision a panel of the heads of e-business and technology at several
major companies, including Don Paul from Chevron, John Leggate from BP
Amoco, Bob Peebler from Haliburton and one or two others, to discuss a range
of key issues.  Little if any advance preparation would be needed on your
part.

We're trying to get either or both Keith Krach from Ariba and Mark Hoffman
from Commerce One to provide the opener.  If both accept, we will probably
have one deliver in the morning and the other at lunch.  Or maybe we'll have
a mud wrestling contest.

Finally, we're much closer to Interactive Texas and wanted to see if there
is anything you'd like mentioned about Enron technology initiatives during
Jeff's introduction.  My wife Suzanne will be doing the intro.  She will
have a wealth of broader market statistics, but you may have some milestones
you'd like mentioned about EOL's progress or something else suited to this
Texas business and government audience.

Look forward to your reply.

Thanks,

Bob

Bob, thanks for the feedback and I enjoyed catching up as well.  Chris and
I both enjoyed our discussion and introductions at the dinner too.

As far as the 9 initiatives, that number includes all of our activities not
just new ones.  We don't have 9 being cranked out in 90 days, at least not
yet!

When we get closer to your conference, I would be happy to give you a count
for your intro. with Jeff.

Thanks,

Mike,

Good to catch up with you and congratulations on a fine opener this
morning.
I think I heard you say that Enron currently has nine e-business ventures
underway and your development cycle from concept to implementation is just
90 days.

I would like to use these factoids in Jeff's introduction unless I heard
you
incorrectly.

Kind regards,

Bob Nimocks

P.S. We're beginning to assemble the program for Interactive Energy 2000,
Oct. 23-26, in Houston.  I will e-mail you an invitation to participate on
the senior management panel Tuesday morning Oct 24th.

Subject: gmp update and mtm exposure

in addition to our unsecured debt and strategic stock risk we also have a mtm 
risk on the cargoes
that we have been importing under ectric. the arrangement was that we would 
import the cargoes 
(enron selling to ectric) and allow gmp to buy small volumes from us on an 
intank transfer basis.
this was working ok for the month of november but with their volumes falling 
dramatically in dec 
they have not been buying any material and in addition have given us a 
program for 3 dec cargoes
that at this stage they really didn't need.  that is not 100% correct because 
they did need these
volumes to meet their strategic stock requirements but clearly they are not 
going to be selling these
volumes for sometime if they cannot get some cash to  prepay for the oil.  
this mtm risk is conservatively
around 9 mil dollars.  this mtm risk reflects the fall off in flat price of 
oil over the month of december.  
this is somewhat of a hedge against gmp acknowledgement of the hedges that 
ectric was holding
against the strategic stocks but nonetheless we are in a situation where we 
should import no further
oil.  robert quick and myself are going to spain in the first week of january 
to clarify the veba oil pledges
and potential fraud.  we are getting several vsl on subs for lifting oil out 
of spain in 1h january to show
that unless gmp is seen putting money back into the business we will be 
removing our support from
them.  given the significant risks still present we can only hope that such 
actions on our behalf in ely
jan. will initiate a response from gmp management that hasn't happened 
previously.  i've enclosed
the spreadsheet that reflects the appx mtm risk on the oil ectric is holding 
in spain for the account of
gmp.  I don't believe we could have done this any other way or they would 
have folded already.
any hedging we did on their behalf would have added further to our risk (we 
already had the short
futures vs the strategic stocks) in an upmarket but cleary we need to 
consider this risk when we
evaluate how quickly we are prepared to take the actions that will close down 
gmp.

Speaking of great to be back... we are heading to Kansas City on Saturday.
If O.U. plays in the National Title game we are going to try to go.  Any
interest? I can probably come up with some tickets.

Spring Break for us is also the 12th - 16th.  We have not made any other
plans.  Lets ski in Telluride.

Continental fly's direct from Houston to Montrose, but the flights book
pretty early.  I just checked and there are two flights per day and seats
are available. Let me know if you need help with your travel plans.  We will
go up on Friday the 9th and return on Sunday the 18th so whatever schedule
you can make is great.  We will have you picked up at the airport, no
problem.

Pelt,

Howdy from Houston.  I hope you had a great Thanksgiving.  I took the week
off and it was what i needed.  I have been working at a hectic pace and was
on my annual sick rotation, although a little earlier than normal.  I
needed the break.  My international traveling is over for the year, thank
God.

Chris and i were talking about life and vacations and spring break came up.
I thought i would send you our information and see if our breaks
co-ordinated and to see if we still wanted to try and get together to go
skiing.  We didn't know if you made other plans or moved on since our last
discussion a while ago.  Our spring break is March 12-16th .

Please let give an update via email when you get a chance.  I figured that
you are in Telluride right now on holiday.

Give my love to all.

Mike



PS - How about those Sooners!  OU/TX wasn't a fluke. Hard to believe, we'll
see what will happen with K State and bowls.  No matter, its been a fun
year.  It is nice to be back.

Transammonia's current business level.

Prepayments for supply in Ukraine and Russia
Magnitudes of these prepays is not yet clear
Currently a 15% reserve is being held from the prepayment date until delivery

$115MM in outgoing L/C are currently issued by Transammonia
Unable to determine counterparty concentration risk due to incomplete A/R & 
A/P reporting (should be obtained at follow-up due diligence)
Most petchem and LPG counterparties are well know to Enron credit
Almost all fertilizer counterparties are new to Enron

Michael,

Hello. I'm amazed we have not met through JDF -- my family has been very
involved for many years and my father, Ross Cooley  has gone on to do more
work for the International JDF group. Anyway, I'm asking for your
assistance. Can you please steer me to the individual(s) heading up
Continental's internet partner development for the different Enron
Companies?

My company, Bowstreet.com (http://bowstreet.com) provides an XML
infrastructure technology that solves the challenge of "embedding"
organization business processes inside partners sites -- allowing rapidly
integration as well as scaling of these relationships. Again, your guidance
is most appreciated..

Brent, I would like to illustrate the growth of our commodities to show why 
this a  great business unit and why this is a big focus for wholesale.  Also 
we will use all of this for the Jan analyst meeting.

Please compile some facts on each business by 
1. number of transactions
2. revenues
3. on line growth of each
4. size of each commodity;  e.g.:  number of barrels traded, tons of coal, 
tons of freight, etc.
5. other metrics that you think will illustrate the point

 Go back as many years as you can get data.

Thanks,
mike

Go ahead and send me preliminary copies of the figures as it is being 
compiled.

Steve, 

Thanks for the voicemail.  I was surprised that you were not up to speed 
(although I probably shouldn't be).  Please talk with Joe and get is view on 
this.  I left michael an email on my view, which is that it looks very early 
and I don't think it is worth our time or money at this point.  Certainly he 
wants to maintain a good relationship and watch them and maybe you can help 
with that. 

Let me know if you get any other news.

Thanks,
Mike

Once the Arcos plant in Spain is financially closed (expected in Q2 of this 
year) Eric Gonzales will be moving back to Houston to work exclusively on 
co-managing Enron's LNG markets.   We are very appreciative of Eric's efforts 
in Europe since early 1998 and look forward to continuing to work very 
closely with his LNG team in the coming years.  From this point forward Eric 
will focus his remaining time in Europe exclusively on financially closing 
Arcos.

We are therefore making the following changes immediately.   The origination 
responsibility for Italy will be moved under  Eric Shaw.  Ricardo Bortolloti 
will continue in the role as Italian Country Manager and will report to Eric 
Shaw.   Mariano Gentilini will become our Country Manager for Spain and 
Portugal and will report directly to the Enron Europe Office of the Chairman.

The Arcos Power Project is likely to create a large gas to power spread 
position and so we have asked Paul Mead to assume the added responsibility 
for our natural gas risk positions in Spain.  This position is much more 
likely to be supplied and influenced by LNG rather than Continental Gas 
markets and Paul will  work quite closely with both Enron Global Markets and 
the Continental Gas team.

Ross Sankey who has been managing our marketing efforts in Holland will also 
head a new organization that will focus on subsea interconnector and power 
transmission opportunities across Europe.   Among the prospects his team will 
pursue include projects  from Norway to the UK,  Sweden to the Continent,  
and bidding on existing French interconnector capacity.   He will report  to 
Eric Shaw for the Holland markets and to Richard Lewis for the Transmission 
responsibilities.

Finally the Continental Gas team is interacting far more with our UK gas team 
than our power teams on the Continent.  Therefore David Galagher who manages 
our Continental Gas team  will now report directly to Richard Lewis.

We have aggressive income targets for this year and anticipate that  these 
changes will create the right links to optimize our performance.  Please help 
make these changes as smooth as possible.

Emilo,
A few things that I want to make sure that we have in our briefing package.
A map of the region and facility
Assessment of country risk
address concern that a lot of "old" money (big Landowners) are taking their 
money out of the country - something we shouldn't ignore
Update on other Ven. activities for ENE


Other 
How is this going to work with translators?
Earlier meetings with Ministers?
We want to have a dinner the night before with key people

We are now flying out after the meeting on Friday on the company plane.

Mike

No special consideration needed.  I just promised him that I would get it to 
someone in your group.

Thanks,

Mark

Mary Nell,

I can't tell you how disturbed I was over this.  I can't imagine how you are 
feeling.  As I said in the voicemail it certainly is not a reflection on the 
teams efforts.  It speaks volumes about the UK and our independence!

No way to take this to the EU?

Chris,

I got the pictures yesterday.  They looked great and were very clear.  I am 
interested in buying a Bonnard and am ready to make a decision on the one you 
have as well.  I will send you a check via overnight mail if we can come to 
an agreement.  What is your best and final total  price for the work?  I will 
make a yes or no answer upon my receipt of your email. 

Thanks,
Mike 


 PS -  I am going to pass on the Braque and Picasso for now.

PB,

I just talked with Cindy Olsen about the project.  We need to assign someone 
in our group to be the technology lead.  I know we have people on it but we 
need to pick someone to be responsible and then  clarify that person's role.  
Please get back to me with the selection.

Thanks,

As you know, the mid year PRC process is underway.  The system "officially" 
closed for feedback last Friday, 6/1.  The system will remain usable by 
supervisors until the PRC process has completed.  Below is a schedule of 
other dates that you should be aware of:

6/18  EGM Commercial Support PRC Meeting
6/19  EGM Trading PRC Meeting
6/20  EGM Origination PRC Meeting

6/25  Associate and Analyst PRC Meeting

7/10  EWS Final PRC Meeting
(In this meeting, Mgr and above will be cross-calibrated for all of EWS.  
Below Mgr, the curves for each job group will be reviewed at the business 
unit level and then overall for EWS.  At the end of this meeting, there will 
be a pre-PRC for VP's in preparation for the 7/23 meeting.)
 
7/23 & 7/24 Executive Committee PRC
  (In this meeting, VP's and MD's will be rated relative to their peers 
across Enron.)

A few side notes:

? Please make sure your employees have completed a self-evaluation.  The 
"accomplishments" section of this evaluation is viewable in the PRC meeting 
in which the employee is reviewed.  (As of today, the system will still allow 
employees to complete the self-evaluation.)
? 
? As you are preparing to represent employees in a PRC meeting, be aware that 
the consolidated feedback and self-evaluation are printable.
? 
? Lastly, if you will be asking any of your direct reports to attend one of 
the EGM meetings on 6/19-6/20, please let me know asap.  I must provide a 
complete list of meeting participants before we are able to conduct the 
meeting.  (Pls. err on the side of less rather than more people while 
ensuring that employees receive fair representation).

Please call me (ext. 59386) or Khymberly Booth (ext. 36019) should you have 
any additional questions.

Congratulations to you on a job well done!  Yesterday's meeting with Joe 
Sutton demonstrated all of your hard work.  

As you saw yesterday, there's a very high probability that this program will 
become reality.  This means we need to consider what our next design, 
development and implementation steps are.   

Press Release
Another important consideration includes a possible near-term press release 
(three weeks or less possibly).   Those who have already press released this 
(Ford, Delta, American and Intel) have included the following in their press 
release : company purpose and benefits, hardware vendor/specs, web portal 
elements, planned deployment period, elig. employees, co-pay if any, and 
other business partners involved in this transaction.  For those of you who 
are working with vendors, please pursue final steps up to the point of 
contract execution.  For the portal development and IT infrastructure, please 
proceed with next steps inthose areas as well.  I will work on employees 
elig., updating the npv model, and drafting a press release with your input. 

Co-Pay
Tax and Legal have begun discussions about how a partial company subsidy or 
employee co-pay impacts this program.  If you have a position on this matter, 
please let Tony, Sharon or myself know.  Cynthia, what additional admin costs 
are involved with a co-pay? Can you provide input?

BU Input 
Cindy asked that Todd N, Allen H and myself meet with EBS upper management to 
discuss this program for input.  I will call when we get on Kevin's calendar. 

PGE 
Tony, if we do not offer this to PGE employees, does it preclude us from 
taking the positive employee tax treatment proposed in the pending 
legislation?

Thanks again for all of your hard work.

I have asked Stacey Dempsey to coordinate a meeting to regroup the team to 
discuss the details that I have mentioned above and any other detail 
necessary.

Mike, 

Attached for your review and comment is the preparation memo we have prepared 
for the referenced phone call.  The actual call will probably need to be 
delayed somewhat since President Chavez will be traveling for the next 2-3 
weeks in SE Asia and then Russia.

If you have any comments or questions about the memo, please call me at 
X-52709 or Guido Caranti at X-52707.

Neal

Greg and Jeff,

Attached is the draft announcement for the organization changes.  I am sure 
you will want to change the ENW piece, so far the focus was on the wording 
from the wholesale side but the titles should be correct for ENW.

Please provide your comments and I'll make sure they get included correctly.

Thanks,
Mike

While recruiting on campus recently I became aware that a decision was made 
at the Program level to not interview this fall for 2001 summer interns.  In 
talking with students and faculty at The University of Texas and University 
of Oklahoma, it became clear that there is concern over the feasibility of an 
internship with Enron, as other top firms will be recruiting this fall for 
summer 2001 interns.  I have communicated my concerns to Lexi Elliott and her 
manager, Shelley Jones, and was told by both that the decision to delay 
interviews for summer interns was made at a Program level based on Enron's 
staffing.  When I asked about the competitive data available regarding the 
practice of other firms on summer intern interviews, I was even more 
concerned to discover that neither Lexi nor Shelley had that data.  It would 
seem critical to know what the competition is doing in terms of summer intern 
interview schedules in order to understand the risk that could be created for 
Enron by not interviewing this fall for these important feeder positions for 
our Analyst and Associates programs.  

I have had conversations over the last two weeks with Lexi and Shelley, with 
no resolution.  When they could not provide the competitive data to either 
confirm or eliminate my concerns, I volunteered to have James Scribner, a  
Senior Director on my team, obtain this market information.  Lexi and Shelley 
either did not have the time to gather this data, or were not sure how to do 
so.  They were pleased to have some help in getting our hands on this 
critical information.  I now have information at hand with regard to firms 
that will be recruiting at UT and OU this fall for summer intern positions.   
And based on this information, I believe that Enron is at risk for not hiring 
top students as interns for the summer of 2001 if we do not interview for 
these positions this fall.  

While my research only touches on two of the schools at which Enron recruits, 
I want to raise concern over this as a potential problem at many, if not all 
campuses that we have targeted for recruiting.    As administrators of the 
program, you rely on the involvement of senior members of the company to 
carry the Enron message to campus.  I believe that we also have an obligation 
to make this a two-way messaging system.  I strongly believe that we must 
address this potential risk for Enron extremely quickly, as teams will be on 
campuses across the country to conduct interviews in a matter of days.  I 
suspect that many Enron participants in the recruiting process are unaware of 
the Program's decision regarding the timing of interviews for summer 
internships.  In working with Rick Causey and Mike McConnell, executive 
sponsors for UT and OU, respectively, they are as concerned as I about the 
decision on interviewing summer interns.  I have copied both of them on this 
note to the two of you. 

Please let me know how this can be resolved.  With the help of James Scribner 
and others, we have already compiled a list of students at UT and OU that 
should be targeted for summer internships.  I will offer as much of my time 
as is feasible to work with staff members of the Program to devise creative 
ways to turn this around.

I am mailing a copy of this letter with the enclosure.

RE: Flair Construction Co., Inc. / Purchase of Lots Six (6) and Seven (7),
Block One (1), THE LAKES OF STERLING GATE, Section One (1)

Dear Mr. & Mrs. McConnell:

Enclosed is a blue lined copy of the Survey we received today from the Title
Company.  Please note that there is a thirty five foot (35') Reliant
Energy/Entex pipeline easement and a fourteen foot (14') utility easement at
the rear of the property.  In addition, the fourteen foot (14') utility
easement runs along the northwest property line.  As such, no permanent
fixture will be allowed to be built over these easements, including a
swimming pool, gazebo or similar structure.

The Earnest Money Contract provides that you have seven (7) days from the
receipt of the Survey to object in writing to items appearing on the Survey.
However, we do not believe that Flair Construction can alter these easements
in any way, shape or form, and as such, the easements will most likely
remain intact.  If you feel that the easements will impair the construction
of your home, swimming pool or related structures, please advise us
immediately so that we may notify Flair of your objections.  If the
objections are not cured within twenty (20) days after Flair receives them,
in writing, the closing date may be extended.  If, however, the objections
are not cured by the extended closing date, the Contract will terminate and
your earnest money should be refunded to you.  We just wanted to make sure
that you were aware of your rights regarding this matter.

Assuming the easements cause you no problems, you should be ready to close.
We will be happy to schedule a closing with the Title Company and with Flair
if you can provide us with a number of dates that are convenient for both of
you to appear at the closing.  We will be happy to appear as well.

Very truly yours,



Donald S. Stirman
DSS/csb

In light of the impending arbitration proceedings between DPC and MSEB should 
we file a third party beneficiary claim against MSEB regarding the Fuel 
Management Agreement? The FMA is not part of Enron's equity in the plant, but 
is directly related to MSEB's performance under the PPA. EFI is due $2.5 
million per year in monthly installments, fluctuating with the plant's 
availibility and based on DPC being paid by MSEB. Currently $13.8 million of 
MTM value and approximately $21 million of acurral (non PV dollars) is at 
risk on Enron's books. The DPC plant went commercial in May, 1998 so there 
are seventeen (17) years left on the FMA. What if anything should we do to 
protect EFI's interest?

This is not yet dead.  Apparently, Exmar and the shipyard are working to keep 
the options alive at least for a little while longer.  At the same time, I 
met with Amin in London yesterday (the organizer of Project Summer Lightning) 
who may have money to commit to this.

We will work with Amin and Exmar over the next several days to see if we 
could structure something where Amin's investors go long on a ship, and we 
have the exclusive right to use it with some money in it for his investors if 
we are able to make money with it.

This is a long shot, but we will try

This will be spent checking out some of the potential players and existing 
initiatives. Also, Elektro will validate some of the market data.
Gaspart
I am assisting Gaspart representatives in their selection of a software 
suite. They are in the process of meeting with vendors, such as 
Ibersys/Sintesis and Oracle. Oracle is suggesting application outsourcing. 
Given the size of the Gaspart companies, this may be an interesting 
alternative.

SAP
Accounting has requested we look into the modification/expansion of our SAP 
implementation. As a result of planned trading activities, invoicing may need 
to be implemented by means of SAP module SD. Also, modifications need to be 
made to meet a Brazilian fiscal reporting requirement known as IN-68. Both 
items have a strong local flavour and implementation needs to be discussed 
with the Houston SAP team.

      introduction


Mike,

I'm putting together the keynote session for Interactive Energy and
wondered
if you'd be available on Tuesday morning between 8-11, October 24, at the
Houston Adam's Mark.  It'll give you an excuse to sleep late in your own
bed!

I envision a panel of the heads of e-business and technology at several
major companies, including Don Paul from Chevron, John Leggate from BP
Amoco, Bob Peebler from Haliburton and one or two others, to discuss a
range
of key issues.  Little if any advance preparation would be needed on your
part.

We're trying to get either or both Keith Krach from Ariba and Mark Hoffman
from Commerce One to provide the opener.  If both accept, we will probably
have one deliver in the morning and the other at lunch.  Or maybe we'll
have
a mud wrestling contest.

Finally, we're much closer to Interactive Texas and wanted to see if there
is anything you'd like mentioned about Enron technology initiatives during
Jeff's introduction.  My wife Suzanne will be doing the intro.  She will
have a wealth of broader market statistics, but you may have some
milestones
you'd like mentioned about EOL's progress or something else suited to this
Texas business and government audience.

Look forward to your reply.

Thanks,

Bob

Bob, thanks for the feedback and I enjoyed catching up as well.  Chris and
I both enjoyed our discussion and introductions at the dinner too.

As far as the 9 initiatives, that number includes all of our activities not
just new ones.  We don't have 9 being cranked out in 90 days, at least not
yet!

When we get closer to your conference, I would be happy to give you a count
for your intro. with Jeff.

Thanks,

Mike,

Good to catch up with you and congratulations on a fine opener this
morning.
I think I heard you say that Enron currently has nine e-business ventures
underway and your development cycle from concept to implementation is just
90 days.

I would like to use these factoids in Jeff's introduction unless I heard
you
incorrectly.

Kind regards,

Bob Nimocks

P.S. We're beginning to assemble the program for Interactive Energy 2000,
Oct. 23-26, in Houston.  I will e-mail you an invitation to participate on
the senior management panel Tuesday morning Oct 24th.

"12" OU facts.....

Legendary head coach Bud Wilkinson was 145-29-4 with 3 National
Championships at OU.

In 1985, heading into the Orange Bowl, Barry Switzer's record was
144-29-4, with 2 National Championships. A win by Switzer would
mean the two men would be dead even. He won.

Bud Wilkinson was replaced by his defensive coordinator, Gomer Jones,
who had a difficult time replacing a legend, and was replaced by Jim
Mackenzie. Mackenzie played college ball at Kentucky under Bear Bryant,
Mackenzie would only be OU's coach for one year. He was replaced by
an NFL assistant named Chuck Fairbanks, who would be replaced by Barry
Switzer.

Switzer was replaced by his defensive coordinator, Gary Gibbs, who had
a hard time following a legend. Gibbs was replaced by Howard
Schnellenberger, who played his college ball at Kentucky under Bear
Bryant. Howard was OU's coach for only one year. He was replaced by an
NFL assistant named John Blake, who would be replaced by Bob Stoops.

Killer B's -- Bud, Barry & Bob

OU plays in the Big 12. Until this year, OU had never won 12 games.

There are 12 letters in: Bud Wilkinson, Barry Switzer, Robert Stoops.

There are 12 letters in Boomer Sooner.

Stoops was 12 years old when Barry Switzer was hired as head coach.

OSU has beaten OU only 14 times -- the 12th time they beat them, the
score was 12-0.

John Blake won 12 games, in 3 years.

There are 12 letters in Florida State and Miami Florida.

And the BIGGIE... Up until 2 January 2001, OU has won 11 of 15 Orange
Bowls.

Now it's 12. How about those Sooner players and Coaches!!!!!!!!!!!!

First Gas is a liquid fuel supply deal executed in May, 1997 that is linked 
to a power plant in the Phillipines.  Volumes were booked at 31,000 barrels 
per day with delivery starting June, 1999 through Dec., 2002.  Fuel 
deliveries did not begin until April, 2000 and have averaged between 
10,000-12,000 barrels per day, well below the volumetric level that was 
booked.   This deficiency is due to delayed plant start-up and reduced 
consumption and has resulted in approximately $1 million per month in accrual 
losses to the Global Products group since April, 2000.  To make matters 
worse, the power purchaser from First Gas has recently announced that they 
are going to minimally dispatch the power plant to which this transaction is 
linked through the end of 2001.

To properly reflect the current volumetric levels associated with First Gas, 
we need to take volumes from the 31,000 barrels per day level that was 
originally booked to approximately 6,000 barrels per day for the remainder of 
the deal.

In addition, freight charges related to this deal have doubled since April, 
2000 increasing from the $.70 originally booked to the current $1.45.  Per 
conversations with John Chismar he expects freight to remain at this level 
for the foreseeable future.

To properly reflect the current costs of this deal, we need to increase the 
Dubai spread to which this deal was booked from $2.91 to approximately 
$3.65.  Initial estimates of the loss resulting from both the volumetric and 
cost proposed write-down of First Gas is $30 million.  We are continuing to 
refine this number and will update you when we get a final amount.

On a final note, Arthur Andersen has repeatedly reviewed First Gas throughout 
2000 and to this point we have been able to spin enough of an argument to 
justify delaying a writedown.  Given the current market conditions discussed 
above (which are publicly known), the size of the writedown and the fact that 
their next review will be for year-end earnings, I believe Arthur Andersen is 
going to require us to write down at least a substantial portion of First Gas 
before they will sign-off on earnings.  Obviously, I have not recently 
discussed this with AA&Co. but I do anticipate this being an earnings issue.

Please call me if you wish to discuss further.  I appreciate any help you can 
give us in this matter.

Hi Mike,

I'm going to use this from you in my story:

"The IT personnel reported into Global Technology, but we did that for
communication and consistency purposes rather than simply control. They 
attended
business unit staff meetings, and the business units gave constant feedback.
When it came to the review process itself, Global Technology ranked all the
employees and peers but the business unit had the greatest influence on where
the person actually ranked and was rated."

If it's OK with you, I'd like to put it in the present tense as I understand
this is still the case today. I think it might be confusing to readers in the
past tense, as if it no longer applies. Would that be OK with you? Thanks 
much.

Regards,
Gary Anthes

John and Larry,

Based on the latest information, EGM wants to be able to mark-to-market $20 
million on the GTL contract this quarter. To do so, we need GTL to sign and 
get final approval of a contract that does not have any contingencies or 
conditions precedent to its effectiveness. I will call Kevin Alexander to 
explain what EGM expects to have in place by the end of this month, and if 
necessary, I will go to London to work through the specific language. Based 
on the latest e-mail from Kevin, he thinks that the project must achieve 
financial close by June 30. This is not necessary and is obviously impossible.

In general, I will stick as closely as possible to the terms of the Marketing 
Agreement already signed and remove any project related contingencies. If EGM 
has the exclusive right to market GTL's methanol, then we should be able to 
mark some income. Then the discussions will focus on how much to reserve. If 
necessary, I will bring up a fixed offtake price for up to 300,000 metric 
tons per year, but I do not think it will be necessary. A prepay is 
definitely off the table. John, I believe that your preference is not to take 
any fixed price risk, rather to collect a fee for marketing methanol. This 
will be easier to get approved. Any contract with a fixed price will require 
sign-off from Bjorn.

After getting the proper contract to satisfy this month's needs for income, 
we will have to work hard to make the underlying project in Darwin feasible 
to avoid having to reverse the M-T-M income later. This will, at a minimum, 
require forcing Phillips to agree to a floating gas feedstock price and a 
settlement of the East Timor dispute with Australia for the gas. Note that 
this issue is a wild card and could kill the deal at any time.

Here are the very, rough numbers for what we can mark-to-market assuming a 
3.5% marketing fee, ten year contract starting in 2005, 1million tons per 
year, various average delivered methanol prices per ton, $500k per year of 
admin expenses to market methanol, a 20% credit reserve and no other reserves:
 Price   MTM Earnings

 $130   $18 million
  150     22 million
  170     25 million

Unless I hear otherwise, I will proceed with getting GTL to sign and get 
approved by its board a MTM contract by the end of this month.

Jim

As you know, I have arranged for a meeting on December 6th among the Art
Committee and Jeff Skilling.  I feel that you should run this meeting.  I
would like to accomplish the following:

1) Discuss our Vision for the collection
2) Introduce Ned and Barry
3) Describe art locations in/outside the buildings
4) Discuss progress made to date and timetable
5) Discuss the process:  To what extent Jeff wants to be part of the
decision process going forward (i.e. is he comfortable approving our Vision
and having us implement? ...Or does he want veto power on each piece?)  The
latter would be cumbersome, and I personally would prefer the former, but we
definitely need clarification on this before we can proceed.
Questions right now for you:
1)   Would you like to invite Ken to join us in the meeting?
2) Ned cannot make it that day (first available day is Dec. 18th) so should
we postpone?  Barry is a "maybe".  Remember they are there to help us shape
a high quality collection and to make sure that we do not make any
purchasing "mistakes".
3) I have a first draft of the presentation, when can we meet to discuss it?
Following on our last meeting with Gensler, I am assembling a detailed list
of potential art locations by floor (including dimensions when possible) so
that we have a Master from which to work.  I will run it by Bonnie McCloud
and Bill Donovan to assure its accuracy.
Lastly, I have asked Bill Viola (the video artist for the work we are
considering) to come down to Houston to meet with us and with Gensler to
discuss where his piece might fit in the new building.  I have also placed a
call  Rob and Gregg at Pelli to let them know that I would like for them to
meet with a wonderful up and coming artist (Olafur Eliasson) who would like
to propose a "water piece" for the circular drive.  You will recall that
Pelli would very much like to have a water piece there.  Eliasson is very
well respected and innovative: He's created waterfalls that flow "up" and
wonderful minimal installation pieces that are quite beautiful.  I've asked
his gallery to let us know if he could meet with Pelli in Connecticut or in
Houston on their next trip.
Lastly, Enron has purchased the Alex Katz painting that is currently hanging
in 50M.  Please call me so I can brief you on how that happened.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.
Lea

Dear Mr McConnell

Thank you for your e-mail. To reply to your queries:
Meier Graefe was the name of the man who directed the print publishing
business of Pan in the 1890's. 'Pan' was the name under which the business
issued a literary and arts magazine in Berlin, but with a special focus on
French art. Pan issued sets of lithographs and etchings, mostly specially
commissioned from the artists and drawn especially for Pan, as in the case
of the Cross and Signac, to accompany the the text of the magazine. These
prints are referred to as the Pan 'album'.

The Signac is from the regular edition of the Pan album, and as such is not
numbered. Only the de-luxe edition was numbered (see Cross). Neither Signac
nor Cross are signed in the stone. Both are very well known and fully
documented works by the artists.

I will look forward to hearing further from you.

William Weston.

me to respond to your message on his behalf.  Mike asked me to pass along his 
sincere thanks for your message and for the invitation, however, he moved out 
of Enron Net Works and the technology area of Enron effective last August and

Mr. McConnell,

I am a Management Information Systems professor at the University of
Oklahoma.  I heard you speak about EnronOnline approximately a year ago
during one of your visits to the University of Oklahoma.  I was captivated
by your talk and continue to be impressed with EnronOnline's success in the
world of e-business.

With this email I am inviting you to serve on a panel that I am assembling
for the International Conference on Information Systems (ICIS) in New
Orleans, Louisiana on December 16-19, 2001.   ICIS is the premiere
conference for IS academicians and is described at
http://isds.bus.lsu.edu/icis2001/ Approximately 1200 IS researchers and
professors from around the world, as well as IS practitioners, are expected
to attend this year's conference. Thus, this conference has a very broad
reach within the IS academic community. The panel would be a wonderful venue
to share with the IS research and teaching community the e-business inroads
that EnronOnline is making.  

The topic of the panel would be to explore your projections and that of the
other panelists about how electronic exchanges may morph over the next five
years.  You would also be asked to describe the business model used by
EnronOnline, and talk about factors promoting its success and issues
warranting attention for its future growth. 

The other three panelists would be myself, Arun Rai (Professor at the
eCommerce Institute at Georgia State University), and Marshall McGraw
(Business Services Manager for Information & Technology Services at Phillips
Petroleum).  The panel would last approximately 11/2 hours, but I would not
know the specific day (i.e., Dec 17th, 18th or the morning of Dec 19th)
until early Fall.

I would like to call you and talk with you about your interest in serving on
the panel.  I will call you on Monday (after you have had some time to
recover from your latest trip to Norman).

Sincerely,

Carol Saunders

Christie, a couple of comments on the 3rd paragraph on page 11.  It is up to 
you to decide if it is worth correcting.  I didn't know if you had a chance 
to make the writing better or simply correct mistakes.

1.  Page 11:  I was president of Houston Pipe Line and Louisiana Resources 
Company.    The term, "Enron pipeline subsidiary" isn't real or correct.  You 
could also restate with, head of Enron's non-regulated pipelines, head of two 
pipelines, head of an Enron pipeline subsidiary ; something like that.
2.  Page 11:  On the 5th sentence, it is mixing a couple of thoughts.  I 
would like to add something like, (after officer,) and establishing a unified 
vision,
3.  Page 11:  typo.  There needs to be an "an" in the last sentence before 
the word extension.

Thanks,
mike

Friends,

Attached is the "Final" draft of the Harvard Business School case study 
prepared by Harvard Professor Chris Bartlett and his research assistant Meg 
Wozny. [please scroll down to the end of the next message for the attachment] 
.  The content was developed from interviews with most of you.

Please review the case and let me know of any desired 
edits/corrections/comments as soon as possible. [One obvious correction is 
the spelling of Cindy Olson's last name].

We'd like to "sign off" on this within the next 2 or 3 days. Harvard 
professors are excited about teaching this case this coming semester.  In 
fact, Professor Don Sull will be focusing largely on this Enron Case this 
semester, culminating in "Enron Day" at Harvard Business School April 26th, 
featuring Jeff Skilling. Also, Chris and Meg will be in Houston this 
Thursday, Jan. 11th, 'capping off' their work with video interviews with Ken, 
Jeff and Louise, which will help "bring the case to life" for the students 
studying it.

Please forward any edits/corrections/comments to me via E-Mail or via hard 
copy (please deliver to EB 4710, or call me [3-6117] and we'll have it picked 
up).

Thanks  to everyone for all your contributions to this exciting work!

--Christie.

Congratulations!  I don't know how you manage to work full-time at Enron
and study for a PhD at the same time.  Sounds superhuman to me!

The FedEx was marked for Saturday delivery, but in case you haven't
received it yet, I'm enclosing the draft as an attachment.
It would be great if we could get Enron's approval during our visit.  (I
know professors at HBS are interested in teaching that case as soon as it's
available.)

Thanks for all your help, and let me know if you have any questions,
comments, etc.
Best,
Meg

Your schedules are very full so I went ahead and spoke to Mark F. about the 
drift budget for 2001 and my thoughts of keeping drift as a consolidated 
number (including Europe).  He agreed it would be easier for me to manage it 
in a single unit  and will get together with you and Dave D. for agreement.  
I suggested that he and all his managers get together with me if additional 
explanations are needed.

Hope this is satisfactory.

Gary

Also, Elsa and I meet with Greg on Monday at 10 am for ag review.

Dear Rick,

You might remember me; we met in September when you visited Metgas in Mumbai 
with the LNG team. At the time I presented a piece on the MetGas equity sale 
and opportunities of cooperation with the Indian Oil Company.

Following Sanjay's new role in the organisation, he has now charged me with 
developing the EBS business in the Middle East. In this regard I had a 
telecon with Mac McClelland yesterday, the details of which are copied in the 
mail below. 

I would like to visit Dubai possibly next week to see the Dubai Internet 
City, meet with senior officials at the Internet and Media cities to identify 
what opportunities there could be for EBS.

We look forward to closely cooperating with you and your team in Dubai.

With best regards,   Anil

Mac,

You would be aware that Sanjay Bhatnagar has been given the responsibility of 
managing EBS business in the Middle East and Asia and our team reports 
directly to him. We are currently wanting to develop an EBS strategy for the 
Middle East. For this objective Amr Ibrahim (Director, Regulatory) and myself 
would like to plan a visit to Dubai in the near future (possibly early next 
week). We would like to have a half hour conference call with you today to 
discuss this visit. Based on your exposure and presence in Dubai, we would 
like to seek advise from you on the below, which would be the objective of 
our trip;

Dubai Internet City. We are well aware of this tremendous infrastructure that 
has been developed in Dubai. Our information is based on what was available 
on the web. We would like to see this facility, meet with the relevant people 
in the Communications group and establish what business opportunities could 
be available for EBS. From our understanding, the DIC infrastructure has 
being developed by Siemens, Sun and Cisco. Fibre connectivity is provided by 
a local telecom party. 
Business potential. We would be developing a business plan for the Middle 
East region and would like to identify what support we could get from Enron's 
immendate presence in the region, in the way of direction.
Immediate business opportunity. What are the low hanging fruit for EBS in the 
Middle East region and what are the first areas we should focus on that would 
give us success, to quickly neutralize cost.
How do we get multiple entry visas for Dubai. Is it possible to get a one (or 
three) month visa. Can we them for coming Sunday or would it be a rush? We 
have Canadian and Danish passports.

I will call you at 12 noon (Dubai time) this morning. 


With best regards,   Anil

After having conducted our first of several business reviews, we'd like to 
outline the following organizational changes effective immediately.

The Global Risk Markets group under Jere Overdyke illustrates enormous 
opportunities given the size of those businesses.  To better focus on the 
different commercial functions, and to capture market share and value, the 
group is being realigned.  Jere will continue to manage Global Risk Markets, 
and build on our insurance capabilities.  Mark Tawney is responsible for our 
weather business and will now report to the EGM Office of the Chairman.  
Still under consideration - The Enron Corporate Insurance group under Jim 
Bouillion will now report into the corporate organization under  George 
Wasaff.

Brent Price will be joining Enron Global Markets as Vice President and Chief 
Accounting Officer.  He will report to the EGM Office of the Chairman, and to 
Rick Causey, Executive Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer for Enron 
Corp.  He will be responsible to Sally Beck for the business operations areas 
of the businesses.  Reporting to Brent in his new position will be Sheila 
Glover, business controller for Financial Products;  Todd Hall, business 
controller for weather; and Scott Earnest, business controller for global 
liquids and coal.  In addition, Tom Myers as Director of Accounting.  Brent 
and his team are responsible for all accounting and position reporting issues 
for all the businesses within EGM. 

Cindy Skinner will join the Enron Global Markets team with responsibility for 
Human Resources.  She will also report to David Oxley and the HR organization.
 
Please join us in congratulating everyone in their assignments.

Rick Buy asked me to let you have a summary of the limits that would now 
apply to commodities in Enron Global Markets.

I have set them out below, together with the levels at which various people 
in the organisation need to get notified (the respective Operations groups 
will take care of that). 



After tomorrow's Board meeting at which various other commodity group limits 
may get revised, we will issue rather handy laminated versions of these, 
which will better withstand general wear and tear and tend not to get mislaid.

Let me know if you have questions.

Thanks for the email.
On metals, I believe all of that will remain under John Sherriff and not our 
new group.  Paper will remain in NA as well.  Both will be re-examined at 
some point but not now.  I like Cindy as well, she sounds fine to me.  Who is 
better, Cindy or Hoyt?

Do you want me to co-ordinate with Cindy while you are on vacation?

Thanks,
Mike

Mike,

I asked team to get you some org charts, personnel numbers and PRC results on 
Friday. They may be a little sketchy but we can refine for you over next few 
days. I specifically want to go over employment agreement and comp 
information with you.

Couple of things of immediate note:

 - MG metals is an issue from an HR stand point. I believe (possibly wrongly) 
that much of the NA end of this will fall in your world. Immediate issue 
appears to be desire to let go some staff that MG hired immediately before 
deal went unconditional that now don't fit. Hickerson is aware of where we 
are and I'll keep you informed as things develop.

- I am planning to dedicate Cindy Skinner (Shankman asked me specifically for 
her and I think she is ready for this challenge) to the new business as your 
lead HR person but I also have Hoyt Thomas (you may remember him from 96/97 
era) in the team for the next 6 months (he is on a contract at present and we 
may make it permanent). I'd like to discuss this with you next week.

- I am planning vacation for about 10 days from Weds of next week, but will 
leave you contact numbers.

David

Mike and Mark-

I wanted to confirm with you that you have a 2 PM tee time on Wednesday, 
January 3rd at the Doral Resort and Spa's Blue Course (The Blue Monster).  My 
future father-in-law, Tom Neville, the Tournament Director for the Genuity 
Championships (formerly the Doral Ryder Open), has reserved your tee time and 
should you have any problems please contact him at the tournament office 
(305-477-4653 ext. 3058).

He also suggested that you might want to arrive a little early because there 
could be a possibility of teeing off a little earlier than 2 PM.  FedEx has a 
tournament scheduled beginning with shotgun start at 9 AM and depending on 
quickly they get around, you could get on the course before 2:00.  

Should you have any questions, please feel free to contact me here at work, 
(713) 345-8741, or on my cell phone, (713) 582-7596.

Hit it straight and Go Sooners!

Mike,

As discussed, attached please find the list of museums and coporate/public
collections in which Jeff Koons is represented.
Given the conservative nature of many of the corporate/public collections as
well as the prestigious nature of the museums, I think there should be no
issue with regard to the controversy of Koons' work.  I look forward to
hearing from you as soon as you talk to Skilling and am available to chat
before that even if you would like.  You should also feel comfortable
calling Ned on this topic.  His number at work is:  713-525-9401.

With Regards,
Lea
713-526-6833

P.S.
Jeff Shankman and I are planning on going to the big art show in New York
City February 21-22.  All of the world's major dealers will likely be
represented there.  In conjunction, there is a show of up-and-coming artists
as well.  Would you like to join us?  It would be very valuable for our
project, not to mention lots of fun.

Mike,

Congrats to the Sooners! With that impressive victory (what a defense) OU now 
has seven national championship in football, which surpasses Wichita State's 
six national championships in bowling. Wanted to put it in perspective. Only 
downside to last night is that soon you will be getting an alumni bill to pay 
for Bob Stoops new contract. I sure hope you use this opportunity to call 
Roberts and give him hell about his whining Canes. Did you see their mascot 
get in trouble?

I'm due to meet with you next week on Wednesday, January 10 at 2:00pm. See 
you there.

Happy New Year,
Doug

Subject:  Presentation to Skilling etc.


Mike,
As you know, I have arranged for a meeting on December 6th among the Art
Committee and Jeff Skilling.  I feel that you should run this meeting.  I
would like to accomplish the following:

1) Discuss our Vision for the collection
2) Introduce Ned and Barry
3) Describe art locations in/outside the buildings
4) Discuss progress made to date and timetable
5) Discuss the process:  To what extent Jeff wants to be part of the
decision process going forward (i.e. is he comfortable approving our Vision
and having us implement? ...Or does he want veto power on each piece?)  The
latter would be cumbersome, and I personally would prefer the former, but
we
definitely need clarification on this before we can proceed.
Questions right now for you:
1)   Would you like to invite Ken to join us in the meeting?
2) Ned cannot make it that day (first available day is Dec. 18th) so should
we postpone?  Barry is a "maybe".  Remember they are there to help us shape
a high quality collection and to make sure that we do not make any
purchasing "mistakes".
3) I have a first draft of the presentation, when can we meet to discuss
it?
Following on our last meeting with Gensler, I am assembling a detailed list
of potential art locations by floor (including dimensions when possible) so
that we have a Master from which to work.  I will run it by Bonnie McCloud
and Bill Donovan to assure its accuracy.
Lastly, I have asked Bill Viola (the video artist for the work we are
considering) to come down to Houston to meet with us and with Gensler to
discuss where his piece might fit in the new building.  I have also placed
a
call  Rob and Gregg at Pelli to let them know that I would like for them to
meet with a wonderful up and coming artist (Olafur Eliasson) who would like
to propose a "water piece" for the circular drive.  You will recall that
Pelli would very much like to have a water piece there.  Eliasson is very
well respected and innovative: He's created waterfalls that flow "up" and
wonderful minimal installation pieces that are quite beautiful.  I've asked
his gallery to let us know if he could meet with Pelli in Connecticut or in
Houston on their next trip.
Lastly, Enron has purchased the Alex Katz painting that is currently
hanging
in 50M.  Please call me so I can brief you on how that happened.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.
Lea

Would a meeting between one or both of you with Gov. Geringer of Wyoming make 
any sense given attached memo?

Subject: Wyoming

Wyoming Governor Geringer has been a leader on energy issues in the West 
since (at least) the end of 2000 (when California's energy crisis pushed the 
Western Governor's Association to hold an emergency session in Denver).  
Based on discussions with his staff, it appears that the Governor likes our 
company and supports our efforts to open markets.  His public comments, which 
are developed by the Governor's office with little outside influence, match 
both the direction and intent of many of our own policy objectives.

You asked that I summarize my observations from yesterday's meeting of the 
Wyoming Energy Commission.  

I participated in the first session of the Wyoming Energy Commission at the 
Governor's invitation.  (We were invited as the keynote speaker for the 
session).  The Commission was created by the Wyoming legislature to look at 
Wyoming's energy future from the standpoint of both consumers and the 
producers.  The Commission was given a $1 million budget and authority to 
take legislative and regulatory positions on behalf of the state.  

In conversations with the Governor's staff; it appears that they are familiar 
with commodity markets--particularly ag products.  They understand the 
concept of basis and also understand that energy commodity markets work best 
when there is adequate transmission capacity, gas pipeline capacity and rail 
capacity.  They also understand that their are some contraints on the 
transmission system (a complete constraint moving east, off-peak constraints 
moving north, south, and west), limited take away capacity on the one major 
pipeline serving the state (Kern--perhaps due to downstream constraints), and 
some problems with the cost of rail transportation (if not a constraint).  
While they have a working understanding of all these things, they haven't 
been able to put it all together in a cohesive way.  They want our help in 
putting together the various pieces of the energy puzzle.  

I can't help but think that there is opportunity for Enron in Wyoming either 
as an advisor (for a fee) or as a business partner--e.g., there has to be 
some room for combining the energy markets--i.e., arbitraging the value of a 
coal-fired kWh and a gas-fired kWh or providing some incremental improvement 
to the market for their sale of commodity out of state.  There also may be 
some opportunity to develop coal-fired or gas-fired plant.

Indeed, Wyoming is a major producer of natural gas (including coal-bed 
methane) and coal.  They want to produce more, but want to avoid the boom and 
bust cycle of a resource dependent state.  (For example, the state moved from 
a $250 million deficit in FY 1999 to an approximately $750 million surplus in 
FY 2000).  They also want to diversify the state's economy and bring economic 
development.  For example, a major focus of the state's Business Council has 
been to recruit "server farms"--because of their load and high load factors.  
They talked about co-locating server farms and generation along the southern 
tier of the state (which has a large amount of fiber optic bandwidth 
available).  While it is unclear, the bandwidth they are mentioning may be 
EBS fiber.

Let me know how you want to proceed.  It's rare when you get a Governor that 
has some understanding of commodity businesses and wants to provide 
leadership on energy issues.

Eric,

A couple of high priority activities we need to address very quickly.
Run down of Nigeria deal (100/400 mmbtu/d)
Bahamas - Skilling update, acceleration of Corp effort, approvals
Elba - supply and managing t-o-p
Ven - Lay call, timing of Ven decision and game plan
R Bergseiker future and other EI people
Asia strategy and clarification
Current view of Long/Short via category of segment (shipping, physical, 
facilities)

I know you are on top of all of these items but Jeff and I want to run them 
down and get an update.

Thanks,
m

As I mentioned at the Mgmt meeting yesterday  8-9 MTM plus 5 million likely 
13-14 million worst case. I have accrued this amount below the line at 
present and will await further meetings before taking any other actions. 
Because of our presence in Spain and our role with GM , Vitol ,Veba and KPC 
are meeting with Chris this week as they would like us to continue to supply 
to them in Spain. We would also like to do this as it continues to give us 
the outlet we wanted when we entered the GM deal but with better partners. It 
also allows us to make money while we sort through the GM situation.

Subject: GM

Chris, Adam and I met with the Spanish lawyers last Thursday night regarding 
GM. We then met up with GM on the Friday.

Basically GM Petroleos (the main GM company) has entered into the Spanish 
equivalent of U.S. Ch.11. We have still not seen a copy of the petition 
presented to the Court, but this shd be forthcoming in the next day or so. 
The idea behind the petition for suspension of payments is to help companies 
that are facing liquidity problems. GM wd certainly fit that bill, although 
it remains doubtful as to whether GM can claim that its assets exceed its 
liabilities. The effect of the petition is to provide a moratorium on the 
repayment of any unsecured creditors, and on any judgments which those 
creditors obtain. The petition does not however prevent any preferred or 
secured creditors from enforcing their debts (in the latter case, to the 
extent of their security). 

The judge to whom the petition is presented appoints 3 administrators. 2 are 
appointed from a list of accountants that the court maintains, and the third 
(also appointed by the court) is a representative of one of the top third of 
the list of creditors.

Once the administrators are appointed, the financial control of GMP will be 
their responsibility. They will authorize any future transactions, draw up 
the definitive list of creditors, and examine the solvency or otherwise of 
the company. In due course they will submit a report to the judge advising as 
to whether the company is insolvent or not. If insolvent, the Court will 
request that GMP provide a warranty for the difference between the amount 
owed and the assets. If this is not met within 14 days, subsidiary 
proceedings may be started to examine any personal liability of the 
management. 

Parallel with this, the administrators will be speaking to all the creditors 
with a view to reaching an inter creditor arrangement on repayment of an 
agreed level of debt. Even though secured creditors are not precluded in 
enforcing their security during the suspension of payments procedure, it is 
usual for them too to take part in these discussions.

The outside lawyers seemed to think that the amount contained in the petition 
is equivalent to USD 85 million. We have no real idea how this is broken 
down, but the following shd be a rough guide:

VAT authority - USD 25 million
Veba - USD 15 million
Enron - USD 5 million
Total - USD 3million
Bank debt - USD 22 million
? - balance USD15 million

The Spanish lawyers confirmed our suspicion that the mark to market exposure 
may be difficult to prove as a debt. This exposure arises from the market 
difference we agreed to sell Dec. shipments to GMP (which then cd not put up 
the agreed purchase price to ensure delivery) and the current market price. 
Chris can confirm what these losses are today. We wd have to sue on those 
agreements (English arbitration), and then present to the administrators the 
arbitration judgments. However, as the administrators report is usually ready 
within 2-3months, I suspect that leaving aside any other factors there may be 
a timing problem here. 

The Spanish lawyers said that GMP Board may have some personal liability 
issues. The Board is supposed to call a shareholders meeting if the company 
is in financial difficulties. Moreover, if there has been stripping out of 
assets from GMP, then those responsible may face criminal sanction

On the issue of preferences, it wd appear that Spanish law is somewhat 
inconsistent. On the one hand there is old jurisprudence to the effect that 
any and all transactions entered into by the debtor before its insolvency can 
be challenged by the administrators, irrespective of whether those 
transactions wd constitute a preference. On the other hand there is 
jurisprudence of equivalent weight which states that this is not the case, 
and that only preferences may be challenged. The Spanish lawyers were not 
able to say which system wd apply in the current scenario, but their 
insolvency lawyer made the following points:

there was no immediate threat from anyone against Enron or ECTRIC Spain. The 
whole issue about preferences is not dealt with until the report by the 
administrators is made to the judge. There is no chance of any nasty shocks 
like injunctions on Arcos etc.
the payment to Enron of USD50 million at the same time as the VAT authorities 
were not being paid shd not overly worry Enron at the moment, as such 
payments are unlikely to be seen as a preference.
most companies (even those judged insolvent) end up being dissolved 
voluntarily, probably as a result of the uncertainty of Spanish insolvency 
law. If a voluntary arrangement is reached it is unlikely to provide for 
anything but the most obvious preference (and the transfer of the strategic 
oil from GM to ECTRIC Spain wd not fall within this category)
The VAT authorities (probably the main creditor) are not pro active in these 
sorts of proceedings and tend to take a back seat   

For what t is worth, GM made the following points:

GM's banks' inability to fund further prompted GMP management to make the 
petition (this despite the fact that GM had previously assured Enron that the 
GMP bank debt was minimal)
petition is for Pta 10 billion
GM lawyer said shd have made decision earlier to present the petition
GM lawyer also said that GMP had made what he called "third party financing" 
of Pta 6 billion, and accepted my suggestion that the administrators wd be 
asking for such funds back 
GMP wd be willing to put up Don Antonio's assets to secure Enron's continuing 
supplies to it (we have heard that many times before). Without such supplies 
GM stated that GMP was insolvent. They were not able to provide a reason as 
to why such assets cd not be pledged beforehand
GMP sees Enron as the "key", namely that the supplies if resumed wd trigger 
the payment to GM of its outstanding receivables.  
GM wants Enron to meet with the administrators next week.

It is early days but I wd suggest the following:

unlikely the old man's assets will be forthcoming
likley the company will go into insolvency
likley the creditors will reach a voluntary arrangement
therefore unlikely there will be any clawback of earlier payments/strategic 
storage oil
equally, unlikely Enron will receive any recognition of its MTM debt 

Chris, let me know if there is anything you wd like to add/clarify. otherwise 
once we get the petition we will advise further. tks

Mike,

There are a number of opportunities that are presenting themselves in Japan 
that to prove successful will need some close cooperation between our group 
(also including metals) and global markets.  I am not implying that the 
relationship is not working, but as I will describe to you these 
opportunities are very large and I believe that we will need to ensure that a 
concerted effort is put forward.  I have briefly alluded to some of these 
with Jeff and with Gary (as he was in Japan last week) and they both seem 
interested.

Do you have a timeslot tomorrow where I can discuss these with you further?

 I like the memo and I'll keep my ears open for feedback.  Your presence is 
needed more than I thought.  My gut told me that they really needed your help 
but its more than that.  Taking contol of that P&L is the highest return of 
your time and talent for EGM and for Enron, atleast for this quarter.  They 
will learn or they will be out.

Based on last weeks meeting and discussion between the team here and you it 
seems like you are moving toward
separating the non-Nordic region and headquartering it in London.  John 
Sherriff and I are comfortable with this and would like to 
move forward with the plan if at all possible effective April 1, 2001.  We 
would split the groups with one Nordic group here in Oslo, reporting back to 
Enron Europe, and one Team for the rest of Europe in London, reporting back 
to you.  I assume that we can arrange all technical and practical things to 
get this done as soon as possible.  Please give me a call to confirm your 
support (or not if we need to discuss further) and let's see how fast and 
smoothly we can get these changes made.

Regards 


Thor

draft

After having conducted our first of several business reviews, we'd like to 
outline the following organizational changes effective immediately.

The Global Risk Markets group under Jere Overdyke illustrates enormous 
opportunities given the size of those businesses.  To better focus on the 
different commercial functions, and to capture market share and value, the 
group is being realigned.  Jere will continue to manage Global Risk Markets, 
and build on our insurance capabilities.  Mark Tawney is responsible for our 
weather business and will now report to the EGM Office of the Chairman.  
Still under consideration - The Enron Corporate Insurance group under Jim 
Bouillion will now report into the corporate organization under  George 
Wasaff.

Brent Price will be joining Enron Global Markets as Vice President and Chief 
Accounting Officer.  He will report to the EGM Office of the Chairman, and to 
Rick Causey, Executive Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer for Enron 
Corp.  He will be responsible to Sally Beck for the business operations areas 
of the businesses.  Reporting to Brent in his new position will be Sheila 
Glover, business controller for Financial Products;  Todd Hall, business 
controller for weather; and Scott Earnest, business controller for global 
liquids and coal.  In addition, Tom Myers as Director of Accounting.  Brent 
and his team are responsible for all accounting and position reporting issues 
for all the businesses within EGM. 

Cindy Skinner will join the Enron Global Markets team with responsibility for 
Human Resources.  She will also report to David Oxley and the HR organization.
 
Please join us in congratulating everyone in their assignments.

FYI, the "Hanjin Muscat"  sucessfully delivered our Oman spot cargo at Lake 
Charles and departed without incident on the evening of 24 September

Because of the high price differential (ENA bought the LNG from us at $4.23 
Henry Hub price) we drew down on the LNG heel and thus discharged more LNG 
than ENA had committed to buy.  By doing this, we picked up perhaps an 
additional $50 thousand of income in excess of what was originally intended.  
I expect that our total net income from this cargo will be about $175 
thousand

RE: Proposed Unimproved Property Contract by and between Flair Construction
Co., Inc., as Seller, and Mike and Chris McConnell, as Buyer

Dear Mike:

We have read and reviewed the above referenced Contract and your letter to
us regarding same dated February 20, 2001.  We want to respond to the
questions and issues raised in your letter as well as make some suggestions
and comments about the proposed Contract itself.

First, the Contract being used is the standard type of Contract used for the
proposed transaction.  The Contract is promulgated by the Texas Real Estate
Commission and is to be used by all licensed Real Estate Brokers and Agents.
We are interested in knowing, however, if the Contract was filled out by Mr.
Larry Williams of Prudential Gary Greene Realtors.  If so, does Mr. Williams
represent you or Flair Construction Co., Inc.?  Please advise us
accordingly.

As we discussed, we think it is most important that you have the opportunity
to read and review the Construction Agreement that Flair Construction Co.,
Inc. intends on using for the construction of your home.  The fact that
Flair is both the Developer, as well as the potential Builder, raises some
issues.  Usually, Builders have agreements with the Developer regarding the
purchase of lots and building on same.  Often, lots are reserved to certain
Builders and if you purchase those lots you are required to use the
designated Builders.  However, often lots are free to be purchased by
potential homeowners who then can choose the Builder they want.  We are
interested in knowing if the lots you are purchasing are actually reserved
to Flair Construction Co. Inc., or is Flair just requiring you to use them
to build your home since they are selling you the lots in question?  As you
point out in your letter, if you sign the Contract as it now reads, you are
captive to the Builder and are not free to negotiate with other Builders.

It appears to us that you will be one of the first homeowners in this new
subdivision.  We think it is critically important that you get a copy of the
Deed Restrictions even before you sign the Contract to make sure that there
are restrictions in place regarding the size of homes to be built, size of
lots, etc.  We want to make sure that your home is not horribly atypical for
the neighborhood.

We do not know if The Lakes of Sterling Gate Estates is in the City of
Houston or within its extraterritorial jurisdiction.  This is something you
may want to find out as soon as possible.  If it is outside the city limits,
is there already a MUD district in place to provide water and sewer
services?  Since this is a brand new subdivision your concern regarding its
future development and tax rate is very legitimate.  Usually, until the
subdivision is fairly well built out, the Developer controls the Community
Association as well as the Architectural Control Committee.  Therefore, if
this subdivision does not take off you will be under the control of the
Developer.

We recommend in the strongest terms possible that you talk with recent
customers of Flair Construction Co. Inc., to make sure that they were happy
with the construction of their homes, as well as warranty work.  Some
Builders are far better than others as it relates to follow-up warranty work
after their customers move into their homes.  We normally recommend that
homeowners do not move into their homes until all punch list items are
completed to the satisfaction of the homeowner.

The foregoing was our general comments regarding the proposed Contract.  We
will now make more specific comments and suggestions in chronological order
regarding the Contract:

1. Paragraph 2. PROPERTY.  As we previously stated, we think it is important
that you acquire copies of the Restrictive Covenants and Deed Restrictions
as soon as possible.  You will be responsible to pay assessments to the
Property Owners Association.  Since Flair is both the Builder and Developer,
you may want to ask Mr. Kent for an estimate of what your Community
Association Fees will be.

2. Paragraph 5. EARNEST MONEY.  We suggest that the earnest money be paid to
the Title Company and not to Flair Construction Co. Inc.

3. Paragraph 6. TITLE POLICY AND SURVEY.  (6)  The standard printed
exception as to discrepancies, conflicts, shortages in area or boundary
lines, encroachments or protrusions or overlapping improvements is in your
Owners Policy.  In other words, the title policy does not cover these types
of discrepancies or conflicts.  However, if a survey is completed and an
additional fifteen percent (15%) of the policy premium is paid, the title
company will probably delete this exception.  This is something you may want
to consider.  However, this cost would be yours to incur.  If, however, it
is subsequently discovered that there are such discrepancies and conflicts
or shortages, then you will have title insurance coverage accordingly.

4. Paragraph 6. TITLE POLICY AND SURVEY, last paragraph.  Make sure you are
provided a copy of the Commitment for Title Insurance as soon as possible.

5. Paragraph 6. TITLE POLICY AND SURVEY B (3).  It appears to us that the
only survey you will be provided with by the Seller is one for the new
recorded plat of the subdivision.  Therefore, the Seller is not providing
you a survey of your actual lots.  If you were to have the standard printed
exception as to discrepancies and conflicts deleted, we believe you would
need a survey of your lots.  You will have seven (7) days after you receive
the Commitment and/or the survey to object in writing to any matters
disclosed or you will be deemed to waive such objections accordingly.
Therefore, please make sure that we have the opportunity to review the
survey and commitment as soon as possible after you receive same.

6. Paragraph 6. TITLE POLICY AND SURVEY (6).  We agree that this paragraph
relating to the Sellers right to continue to show the property for sale
should be deleted.

7. Paragraph 7. PROPERTY CONDITION: B (1).  We suggest that this paragraph
be checked and utilized rather than paragraph 7B (2) which states that you
will be accepting the property in its present condition.  Paragraph 7B (1)
states that you will pay a fee, usually very small, like $100.00, for the
unrestricted right to terminate the contract in the event the property is
not suitable for the purposes for which you intend on using it.  In other
words, you can have whatever inspectors you deem necessary to look at the
property to make sure that it is satisfactory for your home construction.
We often suggest that an independent inspector be hired by the homeowner to
inspect and review the construction of the home as it progresses.  In
addition, there may be some environmental issues or soil condition questions
that an inspector might raise if given the opportunity.  As the Contract now
reads, you are simply accepting the property as is and have no right to send
an inspector out to the property accordingly.

8. Paragraph 8. BROKERS' FEES.  You may want an affirmative statement that
you as the Buyer will not be responsible for or pay any Brokers' fees.

9. Paragraph 11. SPECIAL PROVISIONS.  It is written in that the closing on
these lots will be as soon as roads are in place or on March 1, 2001,
whichever is later.  However, we do not know what roads are being addressed
and think that this sentence needs far more specificity.  The second
sentence regarding your obligation to use Flair Homes has already been
addressed earlier.  The third sentence regarding when construction must
start should be revised to give you more time as you make reference in your
letter.  However, we also suggest that the Builder be put under an
obligation to start construction within thirty (30) days after the date you
notify him that you are ready for construction to begin.

10. Paragraph 13. ROLLBACK TAXES.  If there was ever an agricultural or
timber exemption on this property, you need to know.  Otherwise, you will be
obligated to pay rollback taxes on the property which may go back five (5)
years.

11. Paragraph 18. ESCROW.  As we indicated earlier, we believe your earnest
money should be paid to the title company.  In light of the fact that the
earnest money is in excess of $50,000.00 and the closing date on the lots is
somewhat uncertain, we suggest that you ask the title company to deposit the
earnest money in an interest bearing account and that you receive a credit
accordingly.

Please call us after you read and review this letter.

Very truly yours,



Donald S. Stirman

Mike, 
Know you're extremely busy -- Suzanne tells me positions at rarified heights 
are driven by the need for crisis intervention. Members of your LNG team tell 
me that Eric Gonzales is coming to Houston to lead Western Hemispheric 
activities.  Maybe the three of us could meet for breakfast somewhere close

Mike: 
Understand LNG continues to be an enigma cloaked in a mystery for Enron.  We 
are continuing to expand our coverage and knowledge base of this marketplace, 
especially in the Western Hemisphere and would like to meet with you to 
discuss our observations and learn more about Enron's desires in this arena.  
Also, we have a meeting planned in D.C. in late June, entitled "LNG's Role in 
North American & Caribbean Gas Supply."  With the U.S. hunger for gas and El 
Paso, AEC and other's announcements of new projects, the meeting should be 
constructive, especially with DOE and FERC involvement.  See summary below.
Let me know when you might be available to discuss the LNG marketplace.  
We've just completed a white paper, entitled "Atlantic-Basin LNG: A Whirling 
Supply/Demand Balance."  You may find our conclusions of interest.

*********************************** 
TITLE:  LNG's Role in North American & Caribbean Gas Supply 
DATE/LOCATION:  Washington D.C., June 27-29 
SUMMARY:  The winter of 2000/2001 confirmed the shift in the United States 
from a buyer's to a seller's market. Gas supplies for North America ran short 
as demand rose from colder weather, higher electricity demand and shortages 
in storage from the previous year.  More and more supply is shifting from the 
U.S. Gulf Coast to Western Canada as offshore exploration in the Gulf of 
Mexico has proven disappointing.  U.S. demand for power generation is 
expected to keep gas demand high through the summer of 2001, siphoning off 
gas that would have been destined for storage.  
Meanwhile during the long gas bubble of the 1980s, drilling rigs and 
experienced field personnel dwindled from thousands to several hundred.  The 
current rig count for North American gas exploration and production is near 
full capacity at just over 600 rigs, so the industry is constrained on how 
quickly it can recover.  
The U.S. has not experienced shortages of natural gas like this since the 
1970s and early 1980s when it was feared that the nation would run out of gas 
in 10 years.  Four LNG import terminals were built to supply natural gas from 
North Africa (Algeria).  These terminals are capable of supplying up to 5% of 
total U.S. gas consumption (about one trillion cubic feet per year).  Plans 
are underway to have all four terminals fully operational by the end of 2002; 
however, more are needed.  
Conventional wisdom is that no new terminals would be built in the United 
States due to EPA laws and local citizen protests to any facility perceived 
to be unsightly or dangerous.  Now, El Paso (a company that was burned by 
Congress in the 1980s by the ruling that take-or-pay LNG contracts with 
Algeria were invalid) is challenging conventional wisdom. They have announced 
plans for six new terminals to be built in North America: three in the United 
States and three in Mexico.    New LNG plants in Venezuela, Algeria and 
Northern Australia might supply these terminals. 
Other companies, such as Enron and AEC, have announced plans to build 
terminals in the Caribbean to supply gas to independent power production 
(IPP) plants ranging from 400 to 1000 megawatts.  Moreover, LNG facilities on 
Caribbean Islands close to Florida might export gas or electricity via 
undersea pipeline and cable.  Floating offshore LNG terminals may also offer 
a means to bring LNG into the United States with less environmental and 
community concern.  
The June 27-29 conference, entitled "LNG's Role in North American & Caribbean 
Gas Supply," will cover the dynamics that are leading to North American gas 
supply shortages, how long they are expected to last, and what source of 
natural gas are available from conventional sources to meet demand.  The 
conference will then focus on opportunities for LNG, including the capacities 
and timing of current terminals, the prospects for new mainland and offshore 
terminals, and the opportunity for broader terminal networks in the 
Caribbean, including those facilities that might supply gas or electricity to 
the United States.

Attached is a revised prep memo for the referenced phone call.  The project 
team decided to change the focus to a much greater concentration on timing 
issues and a message that Enron may have to shift resources elsewhere if 
Project Jose cannot move quickly.   Please review and return any comments at 
your earliest convenience.  If you have any questions or wish to discuss, 
please contact me at X-52709, emilio at X-52710, or guido at X-52707.

Mike:  We will advise you ASAP next week when all comments are in and the 
memo is ready to be passed on to Lay.

Tom/John:  We think the call should take place some time during the week of 
June 18.  Our thinking is that a good way to approach setting up the call may 
be to go through Venezuelan Ambassador Arcaya.  Would you please assist in 
setting up a meeting for the project team with the Ambassador in the near 
future.

Chris

ref previous talks, my 2 cts on this new development :

1/ we should keep the old gasoil issue - which still carry balance due of abt 
7 million -, separated from the new gasoline factor which is a new business 
to analyze on its own merits.
2/GM will not be able to repay the 7 million within december, if we don t 
take an alternative view by deliveries directly to all customers, not 
obliging GM to prepay all. They cannot do both (ref my mail nov 21st).
3/Due to lack of GM commercial person, it may help that you contact Miguel 
Medina and take him as consultant (maybe be unofficially)
so that you have an  ex insider view.
Thanks
Michel

Mary,

I would be happy to talk with anyone about this.  The story did have some 
mistakes.  Tom was correct in his statements.  By the way, I never saw the 
draft before it ran.  I think I would have caught the errors.   If I saw it 
before the printing, I must have simply said ok without reading it but 
neither Cathy nor i remember an email on it.

Mike, see the employee feedback below on the JDF story in Vol. 6 of Enron 
Business.  It might be a good idea to talk with MaryAnn Roman de Meza 
(Wellness) about how we might communicate information about diabetes 
detection and treatment to employees.  What do you think?

Hi,
I'd like to suggest you publish something on diabetes to correct what I think 
are misconceptions or inaccuracies in the article "Enron employees set new 
record with walk to knock out diabetes" that appeared in the recent copy of 
Enron Business.  I am not an expert, so you should not publish any of my 
comments, but should contact an expert in the treatment of diabetes.

You quoted Mike McConnell as stating that weight gain is a normal symptom of 
untreated diabetes.  My experience is that weight gain is often a CAUSE of 
diabetes, whereas weight loss is often a SYMPTOM.  It would be useful to 
clarify this, as some people with undiagnosed diabetes could delay seeking 
help on the basis of the quotation made.

The quote "...insulin is not a cure nor does it prevent the development of 
complications.  It is merely life support."  is totally at odds with the 
experience of the diabetics I have known, and could be quite alarming to 
someone recently diagnosed.  Most people on insulin need make only very small 
changes to their lifestyle and diet.  Properly managed diabetes eliminates 
almost all complications - the body effectively functions normally with the 
addition of insulin.  damage caused prior to diagnosis can not be reversed of 
course.  The suggestion that insulin is merely life support is alarming - 
insulin is life support, but not "merely" life support.  Life can be lived 
fully, and while there are probably some activities that can not be 
participated in, I have not met a diabetic who has experienced this.  No 
complex equipment is needed, the treatment is very quick, portable, 
inconspicuous, etc.  It can not be compared to dialysis for renal failure, 
for example, which is much closer to "merely life support".  Even so, many 
people on dialysis still live good lives.

I think it would be very useful for you folks to publish something that helps 
people diagnose both types of diabetes, how they can avoid the adult onset 
type, and the effect on lifestyle of diabetes.  Perhaps you could find some 
nice statistics such as the most common method of diagnosis is when the 
patient goes into a comma due to high blood sugar (at least in some 
countries), diabetes is the leading cause of non-accidental amputations, 
adult blindness, renal failure, etc, and that the materials for a blood test 
cost about $1.

yours

Tom Halliburton

First, thanks for jumping in on this.  I am confident we can get it done even 
though it will be a fire drill.

We had a control or process matrix meeting today and it is all there, it was 
just being held or managed in four places.  It will all  be pulled together 
by Monday in one place (one complete document) and will have about 15 major 
categories with specific tasks under each category with status, person 
responsible, comments and date to be completed.  It will also have a complete 
timeline. We can review that Monday and agree on its content.  Louise agreed 
to review it as well.

As it relates to the people you mentioned, let me know how and/or who you 
want to pull in after we agree on the control document.  That way we will 
know which areas I have holes and how we can fill them.

Salley Beck called (she mentioned you had called her as well) and we agreed 
that the ClickPaper's back office representative would officially be Scott 
Earnest (he has been unofficially it for months and we have been working with 
him for months).  She is going to get in place people to be our Product 
Control Group for CP launch on July 24th.  Scott and Salley will work to 
source it so that we have 3 or 4 people trained and ready on the 24th to 
receive password applications, create customer profiles on ClickPaper and 
start the applications through credit, legal and tax and finally get out user 
IDs to clients.  We will leverage off the EOL process but not use their 
people unless there is some emergency.  Remember, we are only setting up 
people for paper so the process is somewhat simplified.

We also have a help desk person starting next week.  I don't have his name 
yet, but we have him and one more on the way.  We will create for them a 
brief manual and train them on the system as fast as we can.

I did have a good meeting with Louise and Dave.  We walked inch by inch 
through getting a user ID and password to getting a trade done.  We have a 
few holes, but it is not that far away.  She is going to think about a 
process document for this and get back to me Monday.  I have a detailed EOL 
one and we will give it our shot this weekend.

Let me know what Mark Palmer says.  He knows we have been using Margaret.  We 
will sit down with Margaret again on Monday and detail for her the PR plan 
and what she needs to do.  We still plan to go out with a fairly inclusive 
mailing ( a letter) that does not include temporary IDs/passwords.  We will 
tell them that the launch is coming and as special customers, we want to use 
this time to get them pre-registered.  Besides, there is no way to test a 
1000 temporary IDs anyway.  We will send those out later.  as I said earlier, 
the goal is to replace the splash screen with the unsecure area (or garden as 
Lousie would call it) by next for Friday or the following Monday. That way 
people can surf the content and get registered.

On legal, I have been using Travis McCullough for at least four months and we 
had a detailed discussion today about the contracts, what is needed and the 
deadline. There is legal work left to do ( the current draft of the password 
application doesn't work), but if Taylor can help, that would be great.  We 
will get our commercial comments back to Travis by Monday.

I have a meeting Monday with Bill Bradford and Ted Murphy (with Bob Crane and 
Hal as well) to discuss the issue of a manual interface and the control 
issues associated with it.  Credit is fine, we have been working with 
Bradford for months, but Murphy needs to understand the issues with manual 
posting. I will also make sure they check with Rick Buy on his approval and 
views.

The entire ENA Paper group has the link to our site and we will have all 
their comments by the end of next week. They will also be given the complete 
Net Works and ClickPaper story on Thursday at their offsite and are ready to 
help the roll out.  We also have them scheduled to come in Saturday, July 
22nd for the final testing of the system.

Remember, the 24th is a one (Enron)-to-many launch with a financial market 
only.  ClickPaper is not the counterparty in the trade section, Enron is so 
it is simply a new distribution channel for Enron's existing financial 
offering.  Later, we will build it out for physical (probably sooner rather 
than later).  Finally, I will incorporate the EOL link or transaction loop 
but Louise said today that is October or November.  It will only be 
many-to-many if someone comes in and makes a compelling case ($$$) to do so.

Thanks.

See you tomorrow.

Greg,  a couple of other thoughts and ideas for Monday's meeting.

I would like to discuss the entire process chain as part of the timelines, 
personnel responsibilities and key action items.  I think this is another 
good way to find any potential gaps and help prioritize various items and 
assignments.
Andrew Parsons Sr. Director (and superior performer) is a great and very 
smart guy that can add a lot of value to the effort.  You will like him and 
he will be a very valuable resource to add to the team - even if it is for a 
couple of weeks.  He wrote the IT compliance process chain and could reverse 
engineer difficult parts that are unique to the Ariba platform.  He has 
others on his team that could help and I've asked him to think about his 
existing AA resources that are available (some are working on ClickPaper 
already).
Other resources that have been identified to potential added firepower in the 
short run:  Beth Pearlman, John Tollefson (IT), Bob Schultz (LK said she 
could spare him without delaying phase 2 roll out), Dave Forester (not a good 
option because it would definitely set back phase 2 roll out), Mary 
Solmenson, Scott Mills, Berry Pearce, David Port, David Sweeny, Sally Beck 
(advice and discuss additional resources).
I did ask Louise to jump in (and i know you did too) to help on some quick 
thoughts on process and lessons learned.
I saw the process maps for EOL and I think they, or the simplified early 
versions, are very important and key to a successful launch for ClickPaper.
I went by to see Mark Palmer (he was out) and left him a voice mail on the 
marketing effort and what Margarat Allen is doing.  I wanted him to make sure 
that he understood the importance and priority of this effort.
I also talked with Beth Pearlman about helping out (or assigning John 
Tollefson) and I told her that we would be talking about this on Monday 
afternoon.
Do we need to have Alan Aronowitz or Mark Taylor look over the agreements to 
add a trading perspective?

A few thoughts,  see you tomorrow.

trip last week was disappointing on several scores:

1) veba debt found out to be 13 million dollars.  both an operator within gm 
and veba themselves confirmed these numbers to different people
within enron.

2) gm starting to not supply customers.  they have been living hand to mouth 
and cash flows are reaching critically tight levels.   both q8 and totalfina 
have 
not been able to get gasoline from gm since thursday of last week.  the 
stocking 
out of gasoline is more to do with the fact that gm's term gasoline supplier, 
vitol, 
will only supply them gasoline if they pre-pay their entire months volume.
we are looking to step-in and work gasoline thru ectric as we do gasoil 
presently.  
that means that enron sells the product to ectric and ectric hold the product 
in tankage 
and allow gm to prepay as they can (usually payments of around 500,000 
usd).   

3) without my going there I wouldn't have a clue that they were in these 
difficulties.  
the office lacks a commercial person to manage the business.  don antonio, 73 
year 
head of the company, insists on all negotiations going through some 
consultants
he has hired.  these consultants know little about the market and don't seem 
to
grasp the seriousness of the situation.  the only positive thing I can say is 
that they
are trying to push ectric as the only way forward for gm in their present 
situation.
this is positive because I believe of all the creditors we will continue to 
get paid 
the most since without us the business will fold tomorrow.  reason for this 
is that we
are the holders of the strategic stock which is required to be an operator 
and are
providing through the ectric jv structure a way to keep the business going.

4) strategy going forward would be to continue on the same course of trying 
to get
as much money as we can back without getting any more involved.  this is 
problematic
given we are beginning the process of transferring gm's better credit 
customers to 
ectric and raising the profile of ectric in spain.  also very frustrating 
given the lack of
commercial management within gm at the moment.  

5) at the moment we are pressing them for a cash flow statement.  this 
situation looks
bad given their practise of factoring receiveables to the banks, outstanding 
debt (we
know of 20 million dollars between enron and veba)  they have no inventory of 
their own, 
and no credit lines to get supply.  on viewing this situation in spain I 
phoned london 
looking to get increased credit line to gm under a secured line that would 
enable them
to keep the business going.  steve young suggest that we take advantage of 
this situation
to also get at least half of our existing unsecured debt changed to secured 
debt.  the
consultants were sceptical that don antonio had personal cash that he could 
put up in
an escrow acct.  we stressed to them that collateral assets would take much 
longer to
value and register and therefore would not be an immediate remeady to their 
cash flow 
problem.  no guarantee that don antonio will meet these conditions but from 
our impressions
of things he doesn't have much choice at the moment.  would be revealing if 
he is unwilling
or unable to do so because I think that would reflect the present leveraged 
state of don 
antonio or a disbelief that they are going to make it through this difficult 
time.
think that we have a head start on the other creditors in understanding just 
how critical gm's 
present condition is and should do all we can to keep them going while we try 
to get our 
unsecured debt paid back.   

6) gm had approached us about 6 weeks ago to buy the company or a share of it.
given that we might be put in a position of looking at some assets as 
collateral for 
present unsecured debt do we want to get some people down there to evaluate 
the 
worth of the company?   if we were looking for countries where some retail 
business
was a worthwhile hassle spain would certainly make the list.   from a trading 
perspective
I still feel if we could turn this business around the shorts would be 
valuable to the london
gasoil and gasoline books.  greatest concern here is that presently that 
would require us
to run the business so gm don't bring very much to the jv.  the gm customer 
base has
a good payment history and gm have significant storage capacity in a country 
short of
this infrastructure.  hard to find any romance in this at the moment but if 
we going to have
to invest so much effort to get our money back anyway it might be worthwhile 
doing a
more detailed appraisal of gm.  not sure what the value of their retail 
gasoline sites,
transportation company, branded name within spain, etc is worth?  we might 
get greater 
transparency from them if they think we are interested in taking an equity 
stake.
at the moment their greater fear is on us walking away completely and so to 
date they
have always tried to give us the most optimistic scenario.  

7) to review the present course of action is to assign over to ectric the 
customer we are
ok with on credit and work on getting these customers to undertake supply 
contracts.  
subject to credit and senior management approval, we would like to help gm in 
the
present cash flow squeeze by establishing some type of rolling weekly credit 
line.
this would have to be backed by cash or some kind of collateral and at the 
same time
as that is established the same would have to be done for some percentage of 
our
present unsecured debt.   

8) we should prepare a plan for the worse-case scenario.   
 
9) sorry to be so long-winded.   thoughts/comments??

Maryfran,

I would like to thank you for your very nice nomination.  As flattered as I 
am, I believe that our current Chief Technology Officer, Philippe Bibi, is 
more appropriate as a nominee from Enron.  I am very proud of our 
accomplishments when I was responsible as CEO for Enron's Global Technology 
group but my tenor was only about a year.  In August I was asked to take on 
another assignment as CEO of Enron Global Markets.  Although this was an even 
more challenging position I will say that it was a tough decision to leave 
the technology world.

Philippe Bibi has driven our technology group for many years and deserves a 
great deal of the credit for Enron's recognized technology advantage and 
innovation.  He has been in the tech business for about 17 years.

Sincerely, 
Mike S. McConnell

FYI---one of the many,many articles that have come out over the past few 
days.  This one captures the essence of most of them.  See in particular the 
part I have highlighted.

General reaction in the business community is that Enron must be crazy to 
have worked this hard to beat the competition, only to withdraw just as the 
project becomes real.  The phones continue to ring constantly.

At the same time, we have just received the official notification from the 
Saudis that we have been awarded, after what is being described as "fierce 
competition", a piece of Core Venture 2.  We have already wired this with Oxy 
and will exit this week in a manner that hopefully protects the relationships 
that we have built with the Saudis----but the timing (exactly the same time 
that we are withdrawing from Dolphin and filing a termination notice for 
Dabhol) does not help.

As you might expect, the mood in the office is terrible----the team is proud 
of the fact that they started with nothing two years ago have accomplished 
the impossible against great odds (beating the competition in Dolphin, Saudi, 
SADAF and Oman, as well as putting together a world-class LNG supply system 
for Dabhol) only to have it all fall apart with what is perceived as limited 
redeployment potential and little PRC support because of the "ex EI" stigma.

Over the next several days we must work through the UOG Dolphin press 
announcements, Saudi (we must notify Saudi of our intentions by Wednesday), 
explanations regarding Dolphin to all of those that have helped us (e.g., 
U.S. embassy and our local sponsors) and, as luck would have it, the Dubai 
government wants to proceed with the Jebel Ali Aluminum/electricity deal (I 
suspect that they will change their mind over the next several days as events 
unfold).  

In addition, we have employee meetings on Tuesday to reduce the size of the 
Dubai/Houston team from 35 to 11.

The next several days are not going to be fun....

Subject: Article: Firms Line Up to Swim With Dolphin in Abu Dhabi.




Firms Line Up to Swim With Dolphin in Abu Dhabi.

05/17/2001
The Oil Daily
(c) 2001 Energy Intelligence Group. All rights reserved.

It's all go in Abu Dhabi, where Enron's decision to sell its 24.5% stake in
the Dolphin group has opened the door for other oil companies to join the $8
billion project to pipe natural gas from Qatar to the United Arab Emirates
(UAE).

At the same time, the oil-rich emirate has launched a tender to sell 28% of
Zakum Development Co. (Zadco), which is producing 500,000 barrels per day from
the offshore Upper Zakum field. Total Fina Elf, Exxon Mobil, Royal
Dutch/Shell, and BP have been invited to bid, and a decision is expected at
the beginning of next year.
Having been in the cards for a long time, Enron's little-noticed withdrawal
from Dolphin was made official about three weeks ago, when it gave the
mandatory 30-day notice to its two partners in the consortium, Total and UAE
Offsets Group (UOG). Total and UOG will formally announce the news at a press
conference in Abu Dhabi on May 21, EIG understands.

Enron's share of Dolphin will be sold back to UOG, which is headed by Sheikh
Mohammed bin Zayed al Nayhan, who is a UAE Armed Forces chief and a key figure
in the Abu Dhabi ruling family. UOG already holds 51% of the project and will
then sell whatever portion of its aggregated 75.5% stake it likes. Total,
which will operate the upstream side of the project in Qatar, retains its
24.5% interest.

Who else will join is a matter of wild speculation, but there is certainly no
shortage of interested parties.

"The whole industry wants to get involved," a source close to the project
said.

Among the chasing pack, Conoco is making a strong pitch to join Dolphin, which
would compliment its assets in Dubai, where it is operator of 180,000 b/d
Dubai Petroleum Co., consolidating its position in the Gulf. Occidental, which
like Conoco has no presence in Abu Dhabi, is also sniffing around. And then
there are the heavyweights - Exxon, Shell, and BP - all of which are
interested and have the advantage of having been in Abu Dhabi's oil sector for
more than 20 years.

"I think we'll see a veritable feeding frenzy," said one analyst in the
region. "There are all kind of oily types coming to Abu Dhabi."

After the Enron experience, UOG's priority will be to find a partner that is
reliable and seems unlikely to be taken over by a larger company during the
course of the 20-year project, people familiar with the company say. This line
of thinking would appear to favor the super majors, although smaller players
may have more to gain and thus more to offer.

The Dolphin departure ends an unhappy chapter for Enron in the Gulf and is
part of the group's strategy to divest some of its overseas assets. Enron
seemed unable to decide what it wanted to do in Qatar: At first it planned to
sell liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Israel, then it switched its attention to
selling LNG to India. By the time it joined Dolphin two years ago, Enron had
made several enemies in Qatar who would not forgive it for commitments that
were never fulfilled.

Ironically, Enron has pulled out of Dolphin just when the project looks
certain to go ahead. In March, the partners signed the crucial "term sheet"
for the $1.5 billion upstream part of the project, which calls for the
production of 2 billion cubic feet of gas per day from Qatar's giant North
field. The deal is due to be finalized by autumn. Dolphin is on course to
deliver the first volumes of Qatari gas to Abu Dhabi in 2005.

Abu Dhabi is also pushing ahead with its plan to sell 28% of Zadco, which is
88% owned by state oil company Adnoc and 12% by Japan Oil Development Co.
Zadco is a long-running saga: In October 2000, 14.67% was due to be sold to BP
and 13.33% to Total, but for reasons known only to itself, the Supreme
Petroleum Council decided against the idea.

Cure Diabetes Kick-Off Luncheon on Wednesday, September 6th, 11:30 a.m. - 
1:00 p.m. at the Hyatt Regency Hotel.  I would like to take this opportunity 
to personally invite and encourage each of you to attend and join me as we 
represent Enron at this important meeting.

Our plan is to reserve several tables at the luncheon just for Enron.  
Whether you have received an invitation or not, I would like for each of you 
to make plans to join us at the luncheon.  In order to reserve sufficient 
seats at the luncheon (and even if you have already made a reservation with 
the JDF office) please send a brief Lotus Notes message to Cathy Phillips or 
call her at X-36898 to let her know if we may plan on your attendance.

I look forward to seeing you at the luncheon and working with you on the fun 
and exciting JDF campaign that we have planned for this year.  Thank you.

Mike McConnell

Subject: Ongoing Dabhol Task Force calls, starting Wednesday, January 10

We will continue to have a daily Dabhol Task Force Call primarily aimed to 
update the working group team with participation by senior management as they 
deem appropriate. All of you are invited to participate. You may find that 
until major events occur, participating everyday is not useful. Thus, when 
major updates occur, we will send a separate e-mail requesting that all be on 
the phone call. However, all team members working directly on this project 
are expected to attend everyday.

On Wednesday, January 10, we will be discussing outcome of lender meetings in 
New York. 

To assist the India team with finishing our daily meetings and returning back 
to the office or perhaps even allowing time for people to get home before the 
call begins, I am changing the time of the ongoing calls, starting Wednesday, 
January 10, to 8:30pm India, 9:00am Houston.

If there are others to be added to the distribution list for this call, 
please communicate directly with Mrudula Gadade via e-mail.

The dial-in details remain the same: 

888-689-5736 (US)
847-944-7277 (International)
Passcode: 6530874#

Bob, 

 I just tried to contact you but rolled to your voicemail which told me that 
your mailbox was full and it wouldn't let me leave a message.  The operator 
then sent me into a Nuevo message that stated that the office was closed.  
Sorry for my late return call but I've been running at full speed since 6:45 
am.  

Please call when you get a chance.  Also let me know via voicemail if this is 
urgent.

Mike

John,

Howdy from Houston.  I received a call from a guy named Steve Scott who is 
involved with several ventures including a German VC  called eStreet.  Are 
you aware of these guys?  They want to talk to someone about e-opportunties 
in Europe especially Spain.  I will ask  him to call you once I talk with him 
but I don't have your number in London.  Two questions, what is your  phone 
number in London (the phone book has you in Germany) and do you know these 
guys?

Thanks,
Mike

The first phase of the energy.enron.com pilot program was launched earlier 
this week.  Through this site we will initially offer a one- and two-year 
fixed-price gas product to small and medium-sized businesses behind four 
utilities in Ohio and Illinois.  We are contacting these customers using a 
direct mail piece (attached below) that was released Monday.  Customers 
accessing the site can receive real-time quotes for our retail gas products 
and a contract.

The objectives of the pilot are two-fold.  First, to learn what small and 
medium-sized businesses like and dislike about purchasing energy products 
through the web.  Second, to understand the technical and business process 
challenges we will face in offering these products on a larger scale through 
the web.  We wanted to achieve both these objectives in a low profile 
manner.  Thus we used a limited customer pilot.  Our basic philosophy is to 
quickly try, learn and improve, and then scale up.

The team of EES and IBM employees who worked on this initiative did a 
fantastic job despite some setbacks.  We delayed the launch of the site about 
8 weeks for two principal reasons.  First, we concluded that we needed to add 
a price comparison feature to the site.  This proved more difficult than 
expected and still requires improvement.  Second, we experienced technical 
problems with the stability of the underlying database application that 
required a fair amount of time to resolve.

Going forward, we have two paths occurring in parallel.  First, the design 
and technical performance of the existing site will be continuously improved 
over the next weeks and months.  We will add the capability to sell power 
products in a limited number of states in the next 8 weeks or so.  A process 
is in place to learn and document as much as possible throughout this 
on-going pilot period.  

In parallel, we have engaged McKinsey & Co. to help with a 4-6 week 
mid-market strategy development effort that will help define the specific 
products, target customers, and sales channels necessary to pursue the 
mid-market in an aggressive way.  Out of this effort will also come some 
high-level requirements for a technology and business process platform that 
is scaleable and flexible enough to support a large number of transactions 
and a broad array of products.  We envision offering a wider array of power 
and gas products in more markets nationally, as well as other non-energy 
products, such as facility services, capital, and insurance.  This second 
generation platform will take advantage of the learning that occurs 
throughout the pilot period and will integrate with our mid-office billing 
and customer service systems.  We will also try to leverage as much as 
possible from the success of EnronOnline.

A complete post-development assessment is underway and will be completed 
within about two weeks.  Based on our learning during the first phase of the 
pilot,  we will implement specific processes to reduce development cycle time 
and improve customer response to our offerings.

Finally, I'd like to recognize the hard work of the team members that 
contributed to the development version 1.0 of the site.  Thank you all.

Subject: Important Information About United HealthCare - Please Read!


TO: Houston Area Employees Participating in the Domestic Medical Plan Benefits

You may have recently received communication from United HealthCare (UHC) 
concerning Memorial Hermann Health Systems' (MHHS) decision to terminate 
their contract with UHC  in the Houston/Beaumont area.  This communication 
also included the names of physicians who will be dropped from the network 
due to this action.  It is our intent to help you understand the situation.

It is our understanding that Memorial Herman Health Systems asked for a 40% 
increase in fees - a substantial increase that would have been passed on to 
you and Enron!  When United HealthCare attempted to negotiate with a counter 
proposal, Memorial Hermann cancelled their contract.

While this contractual arrangement was between the hospital system and UHC, 
Enron continues to support UHC in their ongoing contract negotiation 
efforts.  At this time, it is only UHC which has been affected, however, it 
is our understanding that Cigna has also been contacted by the hospital group 
and may be in contract negotiations at this time as well.  

Many doctors have obtained admission privileges to other area hospitals 
within the UHC Network or have contracted directly with UHC including those 
with admission privileges to The Woodlands, Sugarland and Clear Lake 
Hospitals, to name a few.  In a further effort to limit disruption to our 
affected employees and families who are enrolled in the UHC Network or EPO 
options, Enron has authorized UHC to process claims incurred between 
September 28 and December 31, 2000 as if the termination of the Memorial 
Hermann Health Systems from the network had not occurred and In-Network 
benefits applied.  Office visits will have a $10 copayment and all other 
charges will be covered at 90%.  Hospital admissions will still need to be 
pre-certified with UHC.

These steps have decreased the number of participants' affected by Primary 
Care Physician disruption from 1,050 to 127.

If You Need Medical Attention:  You or your doctor/hospital must call UHC's 
customer service number so proper benefits can be verified.  In some cases 
the hospital or doctor may request payment at the time service is performed.  
If this should happen, please obtain an itemized statement and submit it to 
UHC with a claim form for prompt reimbursement.  Claim forms can be obtained 
by calling 1-800-332-7979 or in Houston at 713-853-7979 ( press 1).

Open enrollment materials will be coming soon.  Take this opportunity to 
consider your elections for 2001.  

United HealthCare and Enron HR are committed to assisting Enron employees 
through this transition.  We will communicate any  further developments that 
may impact you or your family.

Virgina,
Hello from Singapore.  Thanks for the email.  I am interested in the 
Lichtenstein.  Is the #4 the same as the one you had in the gallery?
What is the price and what does the frame look like?  Do you have a picture 
or could you put it on your website?
I am still interested in the Matisse but Chris isn't so sure.  We are still 
thinking about that one.
Thanks,
Mike

John,

thanks for the comments.  Absolutely on the trader comment, I forgot.  I like 
the ag business and we are looking at several oppts and making a final 
determination in Q1.  I also think "softs" is a big oppt that is probably 
worth pursuing.  More later.
I like the weather idea as well.

On another note, I met this guy when I spoke at the AA Energy symposium.  He 
runs a power business (i think) in Portugal.  He has attempted to talk to 
someone at Enron in Europe but hasn't heard back.  He has given me his email 
address and requested a contact.  Would you please make sure that someone 
follows up with him.

Company:  Finertec, SA (?)

Mike

Thanks for the docusment - I will clearly take the chance to steal some 
of your material for my presentations.  A couple of minor suggestions:

1)  I would generally replace the term "trader" with "market maker"
2)  Are we committed to Ag markets yet?  I have doubts about
     the fit for us.
3)  For Weather how about showing the number of cities for which we 
      make markets?   Also the fact that we trade hot weather, cold weather,
      wet weather, and dry weather.

Regards,

John

Virginia,

Thanks for the emails.  No interest in the above or the miro.  I am actively 
looking for a Pierre Bonnard lithograph, in color and signed.  Also looking 
for Lautrec but probably after Bonnard.  I will want to see numerous examples 
before I choose the Lautrec that we want.

If you have any Bonnards,  please let me know and send a copy of the image.

Oman LNG is now taking a 5-person delegation, including 2 relatively high 
level government officials, to Bombay to have dinner with DPC on Friday and 
to meet formally on Saturday.  The Denton Hall lawyer that represented Oman 
in the LNG negotiations, will also be there.

Clay is in Australia and cannot attend, but I will be there for both the 
dinner and the meeting to manage/referree the discussions.  I will return

Dear Mike:

Mr. Kent and I spoke today regarding our points in my letter to him relating
to the Contract.  Mr. Kent was very cooperative and agreed to make most of
the changes we have requested.  He is anxious to close on the lots very
soon, however.  In addition, he stated that in the event you cannot reach an
agreement with him after the purchase of the lots regarding the construction
contract itself, he would be willing to purchase the lots back at some
reduced rate, probably seventy five percent (75%), or allow you to sell the
lots to a third party provided the same restriction regarding the use of
Flair Construction applied.

I suggested to Mr. Kent that I prepare the revised Contract rather than Mr.
Larry Williams.  He agreed.  Therefore, I will draft up the new revised
Contract as soon as possible and will send you a copy first to review before
we forward it to Mr. Kent.  I intend on using the same Texas Real Estate
Commission Form that was initially used.

Unfortunately, however, I unexpectedly have to be in Austin, probably
Wednesday and Thursday.  Therefore, I will probably begin work on the
revised Contract next week.  Mr. Kent said that was no problem with him.

Very truly yours,



Donald S. Stirman

I am looking forward to moving our transportation business into continental

On August 31 (yesterday) we signed an Agreement with Corus UK Limited

the right but not the obligation to import up to all available third party 
capacity (ca. 2 million tons per year) at the Redcar Facility for a term of 5 
years;
through an incentivised price schedule, a throughput rate that falls with 
each vessel which passes through the facility;
a price schedule that is not adjusted for inflation during the entire 5 year 
contract term;  
the unrestricted right to resell any or all slots to third parties during the 
5 year contract term;

Coupled with our recent deal with Immingham (5 years of free options for the 
full coal import capacity at new HIT Terminal), Enron Coal Services has a 
unique and unrivalled position in ports and rail vis-a-vis all the major UK 
coal importers.   Together with the recent Freightliner deal, Enron has 
constructed the lowest cost and longest term "Coal Pipeline" to the major UK 
coal-fired generators (pls. see attached map)

As a result, Enron is currently the only coal supplier in the UK with:

5 year call options on the available capacity of Redcar and HIT, the two most 
important coal import facilities in the UK;
the ability to provide competitive rail to our customers from Redcar and 
Immingham. 

We have opted not to publicise this transaction in order not to spook our 
current and potential clients in the Aire and Trent Valleys.   We would 
prefer the market to continue to think that we are offering aggressive 
multi-year delivered coal prices "because we just don't know what we are 
doing."  Thanks for keeping this quiet.  

Many thanks to Steve Pirozzi, John Moran, Pierre Aury, Cornelia Luptowitsch, 
Chris Connelly, Robert Quick, Matt Arnold, Stu Staley and the entire Enron 
Coal Team!

Dear beautiful and majestic butterfly and wonerful wizard Harry Potter,

How are you!!!!   Did you have a great time trick or treating?  I so wish I 
could have been there.  You know I wouldn't have missed it if I could have 
possibly been there.  Did Mommy take a lot of pictures?  I hope so.  I can't 
wait to see them.

Will you show me what you looked like when I get home?

I love you,

Ken,

Per my voicemail, we are having an all employee meeting on next Monday at the 
Hyatt Regency.  The purpose of this meeting is to pull everyone together for 
an update on EGM and a brief presentation from all the business units within 
EGM.  This includes about 1 hour of business and then drinks and food - we 
expect about 500 people.  

We have made a lot of progress on changing the nature and profitability of 
these businesses and we want to make sure everyone sees just how far we have 
come in a few months.  

I believe they will be motivated to see the growth and profitability.  We had 
a record Q1 with $100 million of gross margin.  That was 50% of what they 
made in all of 2000.  Combined with the fact that in December of 2000 alone 
we made $87 million in gross margin, I believe it will have a big impact.

If you could attend the meeting even for a few minutes it would go a long way 
in helping us drive our other point which is that the EGM businesses are now 
core to Enron and has the attention of both you and Jeff.

Thanks for considering this and let me know if you need any other information 
or assistance.

Mike

Thor,

A quick note.  I don't believe I ever followed up with you on your weather 
business plan.  I looked at it several times primarily in pieces while 
traveling overseas.  I read it again today and wanted to give you some 
feedback.  I thought it was excellent work and very well presented.  Thank 
you for all your effort. 

 I am in town this week, I canceled being out of the office an additional 3 
days, and I will be spending time thinking about weather as well as some of 
our other businesses.  I'll give you a call toward the end of the week to 
discuss some of the ideas you presented. 

Mike

My sincerest thanks to all of you that were able to attend the JDF Kick-off 
Luncheon on September 6th.  It was a great event and a wonderful opportunity 
for those of you not familiar with JDF to find out what the JDF Walk is all 
about.  For those of you that were not able to join us, we missed you and we 
look forward to having you join us for our future sessions.

The Enron/JDF Team Leaders Kick-off Luncheon will take place on Wednesday, 
September 13th, at the Houston Metropolitan Racquet Club (The Met) beginning 
at 11:30 a.m.  I would like to encourage each of you to mark your calendar 
and make plans to attend this very important luncheon meeting.  At this 
kick-off meeting we will be distributing supplies and gift bags, reviewing 
important details about our campaign, learning more about JDF, and discussing 
our fundraising goal for this year's campaign.  Enron has been the number 1 
walk team in Houston for 5 years in a row and we plan to continue in that 
position and we need your help to make it happen!  

Please take just a moment to RSVP your attendance via e-mail to Rachel Feldt 
on the Corporate Lotus Notes directory or to rachel.feldt@enron.com.

The Steering Committee members for this year's campaign are listed below.  
Please feel free to contact me or any Steering Committee member if you have 
any questions or if you have friends that you would like to sign up to help 
with our campaign.

John,

Here is a brief email on a possible resolution for the European/Oslo  weather 
situation.  Mark sent this draft to me last weekend but i haven't had time to 
review it this week.  Personally, I think that this is the wrong answer from 
a Corporate perspective but this issue keeps hanging around and isn't worth 
any more of our time.  For what it is worth, I think our communication 
strategy did make a big difference but didn't get us exactly where we needed 
to be.  These groups will be expected (and held accountable) for good and 
consistent communication on an ongoing basis as well.   For a P&L that is 
this small (and negative) we are all spending too much time on this.  There 
is more to this story but I think we should just drop it and move on to 
bigger and better things.

I am certainly not wedded to any of this but would rather focus on all the 
other issues and problems on my plate.  Let's discuss upon your return on our 
weekly call.

Thanks and I hope your vacation was relaxing.

Mike 

ps-this hasn't been shared outside the group on the email.

Subject: European Weather

I propose to structure Weather Risk Management in Europe as follows:
 
I have responsibility and authority for all weather related activities 
including: trading (incl. EOL), structuring, origination, research, etc... 
for all of Europe with the exception of Finland, Norway and Sweeden.  I will 
run Europe out of the London office with people reporting directly to me.  
Accordingly, I will allocate V@R and delegate trading authority to personnel 
in the London office. 

I anticipate having Paul Murray run our activities in London. Janine Juggins 
in the London Tax department is establishing the necessary entities and 
addressing the relevant tax issues.  Simon Thurbin in London who reports to 
Todd Hall is identifying a book administrator for our group.  Cindy Horn 
again in London is securing space for an initial 8 to 10 individuals.  We 
have hired an assistant who is multilingual to assist in the setting up of 
our activities.  We are working with Stuart Reed in Houston IT and Brian 
Hudson in London IT (coordinating with Oslo) to ensure that we have the 
infrastructure necessary to trade weather.

In addition to Paul Murray, Ross McIntyre, and the assistant, Catherine 
Woolgar will return to London.  We have also identified an individual in 
London to provide research support. For sturcturing, we will send one 
individual for the Houston group and hire one new employee already identified.

Paul Murray will focus on the management of the office, relationships within 
Europe and the execution of large structured trades.  All other individuals 
in the London office will have dual reporting with a dotted line to Paul and 
a direct line to the group leaders in Houston to ensure continuity and 
accountability.

With respect to Scandinavia, I propse that those activities be treated as 
completely separate with their own V@R and trading authority.  Their 
activities should be limited only to Scandinavia.  The Houston group will 
share infomation and knowledge in the same way that we would with other desks 
within Enron.  Should any of the groups reporting to me wish to take on a 
Scandinavian position, they will have to do so through the Oslo weather 
group.  Likewise, should the Oslo weather group wish to take any weather 
positions outside of Scandanavian, they will need to do so through me.

Paul Murray and I will develop a new budget for Europe taking into 
consideration the time needed to establish our activities.  Oslo will retain 
responsibility for the European budget as originally proposed by Thor Lien.

add the following people to my list of reviewers (Robert Jones, Jay

Marty,
Thanks so much for your email and support!  I apologize for the slow response 
but I am in Asia and have had some difficulties keeping up.  

You don't need to worry about the matching, I'll take care of it all.  We are 
making this hassle free for the supporters.

Thanks again so much.

It is my sincere honor to once again lead the Enron team in this year's 
Juvenile Diabetes Foundation (JDF) walk scheduled to take place on Sunday, 
November 5, 2000, at the Sam Houston Race Park.  I continue to serve on the 
board of JDF representing Enron and will be Enron's corporate executive for 
this year's fundraising efforts.

As many of you may already know, I am an insulin dependent diabetic myself.  
Even though I know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the 
multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day, I cannot 
imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease.  Taking 
insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of 
complications; insulin is simply their life support system and without it 
they would die.

Enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for JDF again this year.  JDF 
is a very efficient organization in which approximately 84% of all money 
raised goes directly to research.  Enron's goal this year is to raise 
$225,000 and we need your help.  Enron has been the number 1 walk team for 5 
years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place!  We need team 
leaders, walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal.  The theme for the 
walk this year is "Knock Out Diabetes" and we would like to have you join us 
for this great event.  The Walk is truly a blast and we had about 500 Enron 
people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it.

If you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader, or if 
you would like to make a pledge, you may call any of the steering committee 
members listed below.  If you are interested in being a team leader, please 
contact one of the following people immediately so that you may be included 
in the first important and informative training session taking place this 
week.

Thank you very much for your support.

We just finished the meeting  with Dale Laurance and Casey Olson. Here's a 
recap.

Oxy wanted to meet with Mike for two reasons:

 1) Make sure Enron and Oxy had a project team in place asap and the 
resources are committed to do a world class job on the January 29 submission 
and subsequent presentations. As Mike noted- we are in sudden death overtime 
and the 29th could be the end of the tournament.
 2) Revisit the "street talk" about Enron redeploying capital.

Mike walked through the EGM organization, talked about our stock multiple  
and how an announcement that we were putting huge dollars in Saudi  would 
hurt our stock price.

Dale talked about their low multiple (between 4 and 5), noted that the market 
viewed Oxy as a company that could do deals, buy and sell assets, but really 
wasn't a growth company. They now have a stable cash flow, but need a  new 
beach head in the Middle East to demonstrate they are growing. The point of 
this conversation was to tell us that debt reduction is also a top priority 
so they were also not interested in a big announcement about money being 
dumped into Saudi Arabia

They characterized the Saudi perspective as being one where they are looking 
for strategic partners who will be there for a long time and invest capital. 
They agree on a division of labor: Oxy can do E&P, processing and 
petrochemicals and look to us for pipelines and power plants although Oxy can 
do those too. They realize that only Enron has the marketing, structuring  
and regulatory expertise. 

Casey did revisit his conversation with you about in the end Enron ends up as 
some type of "merchant banker." That's OK in the end- Dale even said they 
would take over our part of any project-- but we can't project that role 
initially. We need to be on the same side of the table as Oxy.


The point here is that we have to be in step with a consistent approach to 
the projects. They expect our competitors to say they'll finance things on 
balance sheet and we need initially to say the same thing although later we 
will open discussions on other ways to finance. Mike and I agree that this is 
probably the biggest sticking point in the discussion today. Oxy believes 
that such an initial statement will never be public and we aren't really 
locked in an on-balance sheet approach. Maybe  we can do this, maybe we can't.

They see this as a year long process with PDA's stretching well into next 
year, and 2002 when the real money would be spent. The short term crisis is  
January 29 and we need a submission with lots of pages: we were criticized 
that although our proposal was well thought through and technically superb, 
it didn't have enough pages- reams of paper to impress  the technocrats.  We 
will also need to prepare a smaller 15 page digest to be used for our 
official February presentation and a three page walk around summary. Casey 
thinks the production center has to be in the US.

We also all agreed that the Jan 29  questions allow us to lay out all of our 
downstream concerns and establish a placeholder for issues that must be 
resolved during the PDA discussions before we would do a project. I have had 
the greatest success around the world when we don't try to force immediately 
on a country  a perfect gas or electric market but adapt to "local 
conditions" and implement the most important first couple of steps with the 
rest to follow later. In this respect,  our projects can include suggested 
regulatory concepts that if successful can be used elsewhere in the Kingdom.

Over and over we came back to the project team which they want on the ground 
in Saudi.  Casey will be 100% Saudi for the foreseeable future and can make 
all decisions. Who will be our lead person with the same authority? They 
don't want to deal with someone who later says Houston changed it's mind ( a 
little arrogant). When can we identify bodies and assignments and location? 
They want full time dedicated people. Either Dale or Casey noted that the old 
Enron would have parachuted a team in by now (Like South America where we 
landed in a swamp and spent the next five years beating alligators over the 
head with a stick). This is a very complicated political and technical 
effort,. The leader has to be good at both. Casey was excited that Rob would 
be assigned to the project (I guess you discussed this with him).

They both were quick to say that the working relationship to date has been 
excellent and that they appreciate the effort we have put into this.

Mike committed that we would go balls to the wall for the 29th deadline, I 
committed that I would designate a project team by the first week in January 
(we had our first conference call yesterday), but Mike said he wanted to 
think about the decision point person and process ( we aren't about to 
sacrifice a deliberative strategic/consensus  thought process because they 
are in a hurry).

We spent a lot of time talking about the process. We agree that the Saudi's 
will eliminate one or two participants, that each project will have subparts 
with different combinations and leads of companies with a master JV on top.   

They minimized the capital investment although they are prepared to spent 
$200-300 million over the next 3-5 years. They see core project 2 costing 
$600 million, 60% Oxy/Enron assuming one other partner and Enron half of 
that. We aren't talking billions (spoken like a true major).

They are sure Exxon /Mobil will be our Red Sea partner if only to earn face  
with possibly Marathon as the other. Exxon is more interested in the chemical 
focus which Oxy will concede to them. Mike noted was that our worst nightmare 
was a partner (Exxon) who would throw away money just to have a presence).  
We were assured that Oxy's only goal was to make money and if he projects 
didn't, they would walk away.

The real danger in the upstream is the risk money for exploration. Oxy hopes 
to hedge this risk with downstream investments (pipelines and plants) and 
hopes that if the exploration is successful and reserves are added it will 
lead to a whole new series of projects.

They are very proud of Oxy's role in this, claim that they were instrumental 
in getting Petry Parkman and Morgan selected as advisors, that Irani is the 
most respected American Arab business man and has  great access in the 
Kingdom, and that they already know what investments partners are acceptable 
to the Saudi's.

We  all left great friends in good Christmas spirit.

>From our perspective:

 Saudi is the largest economy in the Middle east and the driver in 
international oil and liquids markets

 Enron needs to get inside and establish relationships with the key Saudi 
people. We need a foot print in the Kingdom with which to earn their 
respect.  Can we do it with minimal capital investment?

 Saudi is about to embark of a complete electric and gas restructuring, 
regulatory included. They want the repatriation of petro dollars and dollars 
held offshore by Saudi nationals.  The country can be a tremendous source of 
capital.

 It looks like 2001 can be managed with a minimum burn rate with the most 
intense period of activity being in January. We  need to set up the team for 
the January effort. I'll have this done by Jan 1. There is the question of 
sorting out conflicts with other ME priorities.

 Although it may be too soon to answer (we don't know yet what is possible 
but we can shape that outcome), what is the end game, what do we want out of 
Saudi Arabia? 

 We seem to have a clear division of labor and strategy with Oxy although we 
need to sort out what we say about on balance sheet financing. We also need 
to keep in mind that our other yet to be met partners will have a lot to say.

 Oxy wants to take the lead on the Core Venture 2 (Red Sea). I agree- this is 
a perfect laboratory to address all of the market structure issues that will 
make the Kingdom a great place to do business.



  Mike- I'm sure you can add more. Rick -it's up to you if you want to send 
this around to the Saudi team.  Merry Christmas.

Mike McConnell is out of the office on vacation until next Wednesday.  He 
does not have his computer with him on this trip, therefore he has asked me 
to scan his e-mail for him.  Since he returns Wednesday, his calendar is very 
full and unfortunately he will be in a meeting with the Executive Committee 
off-site on Friday.  I can tentatively hold 1:30 - 2:00 p.m. on Wednesday 
afternoon.  Since I will be unable to confirm this meeting with Mike until he 
returns that same morning, can you please call me at X-36898 on Wednesday 
morning to confirm the appointment.

Thank you.

Emilio,

In David's absence, Habiba has been in touch with Greg Grissom of the sports 
marketing group.  Greg has confirmed that the Astros have tentatively planned 
for President Chavez to throw out the first pitch on May 18.  We are 
exploring the possibility of a reception or other opportunity in cooperation 
with the Astros.  As you suggested, we'll also look into other potential 
contacts.  

I will be back in Houston on Thursday and Keith Miceli will be next Monday.  
Since it will likely take several weeks to flesh out the opportunities, I'd 
like to suggest that we limit e-mails to a work group of Habiba, Keith, Greg, 
you and me until we have more details to review with Mike and Eric.  If you 
are going to be in Houston during the next two weeks, I'd recommend that we 
meet.  In the interim, we will keep you apprised of further developments.     

John

Subject: Re: Potential visit of Chavez to Houston for Astros opening day  

John and the rest of the team,
Here are some additional data points:
1. In a meeting between Jeff Skilling and President Chavez in late-2000 (I 
was in the meeting), Jeff invited Chavez to Enron Field as our guess. 
Obviously, Chavez was only visiting the city for a just hours and I believe 
the season started just a few days later. In any case, we have already done 
some previous lobby to get President Chavez to the Stadium. This may help 
whoever is managing the contant with the Astros (probably David T.).
I will probably not get much additional input from Caracas. Nevertheless, I 
strongly suggest that we position Enron as close as we can to this 
opportunity (we will later see if President Chavez actually make it to 
Houston);
2. In addition, in previous trips to Houston and in several ocassions, I 
believe Chavez has always met with George Bush senior and Mr. Mosbacher. I 
would not be surprised if he do it again. Probably your team can also target 
these efforts and keep the action at all fronts;
Please keep me informed. I would like to be involved as much as possible to 
move this ahead.
Emilio

Emilio,  

We would be very pleased to pursue this.  By copy of this message I am asking 
David Tagliarino, who heads the sports marketing group to get more 
information and opportunities through our contacts with the Astros and Enron 
Field.  I am in India and Keith Miceli, who covers South America for 
international public relations, is in Brazil.  While we are out of pocket, 
I'm asking Habiba Bayi, who directs PR support for EGM, to coordinate our 
involvement.  (Although international PR will manage meetings, functions, and 
general support/strategy for this, I also am copying Dennis Vegas since 
sports marketing reports into him.  As soon as they have information on the 
potential opportunities, we will get back to you with that information and a 
suggested program.  If your contacts in Venezuela yield additional details, 
please let us know.  Otherwise we will pursue it from this end and keep you 
apprised and involved in the decision making process.

Mike and Eric,

It was in the newspaper in Caracas today that Chavez is invited by the Astros 
(Drayton McLane) to be the guess of honor for the opening night. The Astros 
played some exhibition games in Venezuela last weekend.  This is obviously a 
wonderful opportunity for us to get closer to Chavez. Can we do something to 
be part of this activity with the Astros?, I copied John Ambler to see how we 
can coordinate the efforts from today. We should not miss this opportunity if 
it really happen!!

Emilio

Greg,  a couple of other thoughts and ideas for Monday's meeting.

I would like to discuss the entire process chain as part of the timelines, 
personnel responsibilities and key action items.  I think this is another 
good way to find any potential gaps and help prioritize various items and 
assignments.
Andrew Parsons Sr. Director (and superior performer) is a great and very 
smart guy that can add a lot of value to the effort.  You will like him and 
he will be a very valuable resource to add to the team - even if it is for a 
couple of weeks.  He wrote the IT compliance process chain and could reverse 
engineer difficult parts that are unique to the Ariba platform.  He has 
others on his team that could help and I've asked him to think about his 
existing AA resources that are available (some are working on ClickPaper 
already).
Other resources that have been identified to potential added firepower in the 
short run:  Beth Pearlman, John Tollefson (IT), Bob Schultz (LK said she 
could spare him without delaying phase 2 roll out), Dave Forester (not a good 
option because it would definitely set back phase 2 roll out), Mary 
Solmenson, Scott Mills, Berry Pearce, David Port, David Sweeny, Sally Beck 
(advice and discuss additional resources).
I did ask Louise to jump in (and i know you did too) to help on some quick 
thoughts on process and lessons learned.
I saw the process maps for EOL and I think they, or the simplified early 
versions, are very important and key to a successful launch for ClickPaper.
I went by to see Mark Palmer (he was out) and left him a voice mail on the 
marketing effort and what Margarat Allen is doing.  I wanted him to make sure 
that he understood the importance and priority of this effort.
I also talked with Beth Pearlman about helping out (or assigning John 
Tollefson) and I told her that we would be talking about this on Monday 
afternoon.
Do we need to have Alan Aronowitz or Mark Taylor look over the agreements to 
add a trading perspective?

A few thoughts,  see you tomorrow.

mike

Philippe -

El Paso Energy is acquiring Coastal Corporation, where I am currently
employed.  El Paso will probably retain my employment in my current role as
Project Leader of Corporate/Refining & Marketing Systems Support, but I
would prefer working for Enron.  The proposed acquisition of Coastal by El
Paso will not be effective until October.

I just talked to Steve Schneider at Enron, and he highly recommended that I
forward my resume to you with a copy to Mike McConnell.  Steve also said
that he would be available to provide a personal reference on my behalf.

Attached you will find my current resume.  I would prefer opportunities in
the following areas (in this order if possible): project management,
database development, and mainframe system support.  My ideal job
assignments would include all three, but I am open to whatever might be
available.  Opportunities to learn new technology would be great!

Please do not hesitate in contacting me at my business telephone number
(713-877-3081).

Thank you for your time and consideration!

Marvin

Doug,

Thanks for the email.  I am glad that you had a good meeting.  These guys are 
good and we are committed to this business.

I'll be at the Masters Wed - Fri.  Are you going to be there during those 
days?

Subject: Our Synfuel deal

Hi Mike.  As you may know, George brought his full team to our office today
to review certain operational issues in connection with our deal, and to
introduce key members of the team going forward.  It was very helpful to
meet the team members, and to understand a bit better how your coal group is
gearing up to be in a position to fulfill Enron's end of the deal once we
get the synfuel facility relocated and up and running.  There are a lot of
administrative and operational issues that AIG-FP, Enron and Aquila,
collectively, are going to have to work through between now and the
production start date to ensure that this deal gets off to as smooth a start
as possible, but this meeting was a good first step, and appreciated on our
end.

Mike/Jeff

Attached you will find the first draft of the B-plan for Europe.
Please give me feedback on it and I will finish it.



When it comets to limits for European Weather I would say that we within the 
next 6 to 12 months would need $3 million ( same as world wide weather today)
So we need to discuss this more before I type up the formal limit request 
letter.

Dear Mike and Chris:

I received the message you called before Christmas.  I apologize for the
extended delay.  I wanted to follow up with you.  Unfortunately, the
message-taker was not efficient, thus if you could specify again your question
I would be happy to research it out for you.  Please let me know.

How was your Christmas and New Years holidays?  I returned home for the
holidays to Pennsylvania.  It was wonderful to visit again with family and
friends.  But I will have admit it was quite shocking to arrive off the plane
to a high of 6 degrees.  I guess I have become quite acclimated to the temp
orate climate here in San Francisco.

Looking forward to continue working with you.

Subject: IPAQ and home machine


Your Windows98 home machine now boots up directly to the desktop icons.
The new IPAQ cradle is now connected and the camera card has been removed.

As soon as Microsoft Outlook replaces Lotus Notes for your mail client, we
can set up the IPAQ to synchronize with your mail.  Also, once migrated to
Outlook for email you can remotely access messages via Internet Explorer at:
http://nahou-msowa01p.corp.enron.com/exchange 

Without having you give us your Lotus Notes password, we could not be 100%
sure that AOL will now load after exiting email ... but Steve and myself 
cleared up two problems that likely caused that problem.  I'll get in touch
with Cathy tomorrow after the 4 Seasons conference in case any other issues
still remain after our trip.

Joe,

Thanks for the response.  As you heard from Cathy, I got a stomach virus and 
all 4 of us in the family spent Saturday night throwing up.  I am writing 
this from my bed and I am improving.  I should be able to get on the plane 
tomorrow and am about to eat lunch (1st meal since Sat. but I think it will 
be fine).  I'm definitely in recovery mode.

I am having everything messengered out to my house later this afternoon but 
am concerned about contacts and getting to the hotel.  I know you have said 
that it is easy to take the train and the bus but I am concerned about it, 
especially if i am still a little under the weather.  I still don't want to 
have a car, but would you please set up someone on your staff to meet me at 
the gate and escort me through the process.  Sorry if it is a pain but I 
think I might need it and it will make me feel much more comfortable on the 
flight over knowing that I will have assistance.

Thanks for your help and I'll see you soon.

Mike McConnell

Subject: Re: Japan trip  

Joe, 

Thanks for the email.    I am looking forward to the trip and learning more 
about what you are doing thus how we can help.  If we would have had any idea 
that Europe could have been as big as it has become, we would have done some 
things differently and we can get a head start with Japan.  This would be 
most helpful.  We are clearly trying to avoid the traps that we ran into in 
Europe and in the US.  Faster, quicker, smarter.  Thursday sounds great and 
just let me know about Friday.  Is Anthony in japan during the trip?  Anthony 
was here last week and will be back the week after you arrive.  Remember,  I 
am not a technologist and therefore can't discuss technology specific 
applications just the business concepts and potential ideas and 
opportunities.  We clearly want your business insight wrt the setup and focus 
of the business.  I will send you a presentation that we recently gave to 
Sherriff.  It is mostly up to date although continually changing.  This will 
help give you a feeling for what the landscape looks like.  On Wed, however, 
I would like to take you through our web presentation and how this fits into 
our overall strategy.

A couple of other questions about the trip.  Do you want me to make any 
presentations while i am there or simply talk about our plans?  I don't think 
presentations are necessary unless you would feel more comfortable or have 
something particularly appropriate.  The discussion with EPower/EJ on 
Thursday afternoon would be good if you could speak about Net Works and what 
Enron is doing across the focus areas.  On Friday, I believe that in the 
proposed meeting with Softbank a presentation is not necessary.  For the 
ACCJ, if you had a couple of slides on Enron and our e-comm initiatives this 
would be great.  We could put this together here if you would like as I have 
a couple of your recent presentations.  Let me know.  Also, what is the 
appropriate dress code.  The Japanese still dress up.  I'm afraid suits are 
de rigour.  I am assuming suits but i didn't want to make any assumptions 
about new cultures.  Do you have any cultural facts that you can fax me about 
the do's and don'ts of both cultures?  We could try and find something, but I 
think you will find that the Japanese are trying to become more western.  
Despite what you have heard, this place is not as foreign as rumored.  Do I 
have clear instruction how to take the train from the airport.  All of us get 
back and forth on the train and the bus.  We can get you a driver, but you 
won't get here any faster and is quite expensive (US$500 one way).  I 
normally get a driver, I am uncomfortable in new countries that I can't speak 
any of the language.  If there is a way to get lost, I'll find a way.

One more item, could you please have your assistant set up a message for me 
at the hotel.  I am usually very stiff and sore after a long trip and it 
really helps.  Make sure it gives me a enough time to arrive to the hotel 
after the trip.  I would also prefer a female if that is acceptable to the 
Japanese culture.  Ono will set something set up here.  The hotel has its own 
massage service that can be accessed at almost all hours.

Thanks,
Mike

Mike,

We are looking to accomplish a number of things while you are here over 
Thursday and Friday.  Thursday's schedule is fairly set, and we are working 
on Friday.  Thursday morning through to the afternoon we would present to you 
the current state of the business and the initiatives/proposition/etc for 
enron.co.jp.  This would take us through mid afternoon.  We would then go 
over to EPower and we would ask you to give a talk on the state of technology 
at Enron and the initiatives within Net Works.  We would bring EJ over to 
EPower for your talk.  Afterwards we would have drinks with the main 
commercial team at EPower and EJ.  Dinner to be arranged for a smaller 
group.  On Friday, we would like to use the time to set up some meetings with 
key IT/tech companies here in Japan.  To date, we have not yet met any of 
these companies, but there is currently an extraordinary amount of activity 
in the country.  We are looking to leverage some of Enron's banking 
relationships to get as high a level meeting as possible with the likes of 
Softbank.  We are also asking for other suggestions from the banks.  We are 
also considering a potential talk with the American Chamber of Commerce on 
Enron and Enron Technology.  The ACCJ is one of the most active and largest 
chambers in the world and bring in some quite interesting speakers.  We will 
have more on this.

For the weekend we have recd some suggestions from the Hotel and will pass 
these along to you shortly.

I will be travelling with you on Sunday on the trip to Seoul.

Joe, 

I am looking forward to the upcoming trip.  

Everything is all set for Korea but what do you suggest as an agenda for my 
two days in Tokyo?  Also are there some presentations or items that i could 
review before I arrive that you believe might be helpful?  I will also be 
there over a weekend, I would like to do some site seeing on Sat and Sunday 
(my flight to Korea leaves on Sunday late afternoon).  I would appreciate 
some suggestions and I will need a guide, could you have someone arrange it 
for me?

Thanks, and Cathy will co-ordinate everything.

Dear Rick,

You might remember me; we met in September when you visited Metgas in Mumbai 
with the LNG team. At the time I presented a piece on the MetGas equity sale 
and opportunities of cooperation with the Indian Oil Company.

Following Sanjay's new role in the organisation, he has now charged me with 
developing the EBS business in the Middle East. In this regard I had a 
telecon with Mac McClelland yesterday, the details of which are copied in the 
mail below. 

I would like to visit Dubai possibly next week to see the Dubai Internet 
City, meet with senior officials at the Internet and Media cities to identify 
what opportunities there could be for EBS.

We look forward to closely cooperating with you and your team in Dubai.

With best regards,   Anil

Mac,

You would be aware that Sanjay Bhatnagar has been given the responsibility of 
managing EBS business in the Middle East and Asia and our team reports 
directly to him. We are currently wanting to develop an EBS strategy for the 
Middle East. For this objective Amr Ibrahim (Director, Regulatory) and myself 
would like to plan a visit to Dubai in the near future (possibly early next 
week). We would like to have a half hour conference call with you today to 
discuss this visit. Based on your exposure and presence in Dubai, we would 
like to seek advise from you on the below, which would be the objective of 
our trip;

Dubai Internet City. We are well aware of this tremendous infrastructure that 
has been developed in Dubai. Our information is based on what was available 
on the web. We would like to see this facility, meet with the relevant people 
in the Communications group and establish what business opportunities could 
be available for EBS. From our understanding, the DIC infrastructure has 
being developed by Siemens, Sun and Cisco. Fibre connectivity is provided by 
a local telecom party. 
Business potential. We would be developing a business plan for the Middle 
East region and would like to identify what support we could get from Enron's 
immendate presence in the region, in the way of direction.
Immediate business opportunity. What are the low hanging fruit for EBS in the 
Middle East region and what are the first areas we should focus on that would 
give us success, to quickly neutralize cost.
How do we get multiple entry visas for Dubai. Is it possible to get a one (or 
three) month visa. Can we them for coming Sunday or would it be a rush? We 
have Canadian and Danish passports.

I will call you at 12 noon (Dubai time) this morning. 


With best regards,   Anil

Any chance we could set  a time for Jonathan and me to speak with you and

his group now moved under Global markets?  And lastly, any further thoughts 
on LNG?  These LNG guys showed up this week without much direction and it

Gary,

There were two such events.  On the Scott McNelly side, I realized that we 
weren't too late to change our approach and take a commercial view on 
technology.  None of the other companies were thinking our new way at all 
plus when someone of the caliber and reputation of McNelly gives you a 
general approval and confirmation, as a new guy, that meant a lot.  It 
inspired me to keep going on a "nontraditional" path.  The other big  impact 
moment was listening and having a brief conversation with John Chambers of 
Cisco.  It was at the eCommerce Summit in Washington DC and he gave his, "its 
a matter of survival" speech.  That really hit me and our conversation was 
also similar about my new job and Enron's new approach.  He gave me a 
positive response and also gave me some advice that included an observation 
that the incumbent IT people may not have the abilities to help me lead Enron 
in the eCommerce world.  It was going to take a different kind of 
technologist.  That moment had the most impact on me of the two.   I saw John 
again and spoke with him at an Economist  conference in Laguna Nigel and told 
him of his original impact and I think he appreciated the story.  He also was 
very nice to give me some time to talk after that speech as well.

I hope that clarified things,  good luck with the piece.

Thanks,
mike

Mike, I too am an insulin dependent diabetic for the past 27 years ( since 
age 7 ) and would be very interested in helping with your group.  Not really 
sure what I can accomplish with EGM from my Charleston, WV location but know 
that I am interested.

Kids are my concern as well.  In fact, I am coaching my sons soccer team and 
have a 5 year old diabetic on my team.

Just a thought for you.................I have been on an insulin pump for the 
past 7 years and it has made a tremendous difference for my life.  Certainly 
worth exploring if you are not using one.  Also, my brother ( Bank of America 
employee ) is on the ADA board for the Southeast region if you may wish to 
contact him about speakers ( doctors ).

Having said the above, I pledge $ 250.00 for the cause.

As most of you know, we met recently with Caesar Pelli architects to discuss
art space outdoors on the Enron campus and on the first two floors of the
new building (public spaces.)  The conclusions were:  1)  The best outdoor
site is in Antioch Park and will require coordination with a landscape firm
pitching a renovation of the Park;  2)  The only interior wall feasible is
the tall space outside the auditorium on the first floor.  You have been
copied on an e-mail regarding potential discussions with Jeff Koons for the
Antioch Park project.

In an effort to continue to identify (in a detailed fashion) the other
interior art spaces available to us, we are awaiting scheduling of a meeting
with Gensler (interior architects for floors 3-40.)  I will let you know as
soon as we have dates/times available.  At this time, I hope to have more
information and seek input on the Koons discussions and to suggest a
timetable for proceeding on a presentation to Skilling/Lay and artist
discussion.

Lea

John, 

Attached is the latest draft for your review.  I changed the format on your 
section and some of the wording.  I was attempting to make this easier for 
some of your employees by the wording.  

Are you sure you want to separate out Doug F from Randy's group?  I also 
added Doug L in there as well.  

Please check the wording and spelling of everyone's name carefully.

Please make any changes on the attached word file and return. I'll cut and 
paste your new section in the master memo.  

Thanks,
Mike

Ahmad,

Thank you for the email.  I enjoyed our visit very much.  I wanted to thank 
you for taking the time especially during your weekend to spend time away 
from your family.  I learned a lot during the trip and I believe in the 
Dolphin project.  I also liked many other of the project Rick's team has put 
together in the Middle East.

I promised you some of the speeches that I have delivered and attached below 
are 3 different ones that illustrate Enron's view of the future.

Thanks again.

Mike

To:  Chris Neptune,

Chris,

Hello from Houston.  I really enjoyed meeting with you last Saturday at your 
gallery.  Your collection of work is very impressive.

I have not received your digital pictures that you were putting together but 
I did talk with my wife about the Bonnard.  The Bonnard is my first choice of 
all the pieces we discussed.  I found an illustration of it on the net (from 
another gallery) and she liked (although - not as much as me).  I am prepared 
to purchase a Bonnard and the Radiator is my first choice.  I would like to 
establish a relationship and do business with your gallery and would like to 
know what is your best price for the piece.  I will not shop the price around 
and will make a quick decision with a credit card number.   When I get your 
response and if it is competitive, I'll confirm the purchase when I pick up 
the email.

Thanks,
Mike McConnell

PS - I will hold off on the others for now and when you send me the pictures 
I will show them to my wife for consideration.  I am considering the Mary 
Cassat as a gift for her.

George,

I just talked to Rich.  I told him about the timing of the settlement 
proposal and that we should hear back late next week.  I also suggested that 
if we get a negative response, that you and i would give him a call and 
update.   He is being patient but I have a feeling that it has its limits.  
His response is logical to this point because as he stated, there should be a 
lot of money in this for both parties and thus a commercial settlement.

Mike

Subject: Sempra

I left you a voice mail regarding Sempra and Kinder Morgan.  Details as 
follows:

We will make a revised settlement offer to Sempra by the end of this week.  I 
doubt that Sempra will accept our offer.  If they fail to accept, we will 
head into a litigation track - which means no synfuel will be produced at 
Pier IX until the court decides on who wins the case.  We expect the case to 
go to court in the fourth quarter of this year.

As I previously advised, Kinder Morgan has been very patient with us during 
this process.  At some point in time we will have to address their claims, 
which by definition will have to go through us in order to reach Sempra.

Let me know if I can provide any additional information.

George

We had to fill out a self-evaluation as part of the PRC process online.  Is 
that sufficient or would you like more detailed information?

All, 

After filling out and gathering all the feedback forms in the last couple of 
weeks, Jeff and I just realized that we forgot to ask everyone for an 
accomplishment list from each of you.  We have had a very successful 2001 so 
far and we need to be able to discuss each group and your personal mid-year 
in detail.  Please send us an email with your accomplishments so that we have 
all the facts during the PRC process.  

This doesn't need to be formal but simply put together and email to both of 
us for the appropriate time.

Thanks,
Mike and Jeff

Brent (and Neve and Bill),

I want to be perfectly clear in understanding this trade, and where/who is 
managing the risks.

Ted, looks like the deal may/will be hedged on Thursday.  They indicate that 
part of the oil may be offset with an existing accrual position (can't 
remember whether this magic was with train 1 or 2).  Two questions:  1) is 
this being signed off on by accounting, and 2) I would like to make sure that 
the offset position is being "put to bed", ie that we are not going to find 
ourselves trading a long-term piece of crude against the UK gas group at some 
point in the future.

Thanks for the help in advance.

Bill

Well, we are almost there, Statoil finally agreed our price today.  Also, it 
looks like the oil volumes that we need to hedge will not be as large as 
anticipated due to an existing long accrual position at the Teesside gas 
plant.  We will get the final amount that Transaction Support will let us 
apply to the Teesside position tomorrow morning and probably hedge the rest 
of it.  The anticipation is that we will need to purchase between 30% and 50% 
from you all.  

Attached are the volumes for both scenarios (30% and 50%).  If you can send 
over mid and offer prices for the two volumes, we will get a final number 
from TS and let you know how much we need to hedge in the morning.

Thanks
Matt

Matt,

Please find attached a spreadsheet approximating the oil volumes based on the 
current forward USD/GBP FX rate & either a 33% or 50% hedge based on either 
of the two Train 1 scenarios.

Dianne,
Thanks for the kind words.  Yes toastmaster has been a big influence in my 
life.  I talk about it often and attribute a great deal of my success to 
that.  I do large speeches quite often and its all back to our morning 
meetings and they seem like they were a lifetime ago.

George,

I would like to have a brief (30 minute) meeting about the noise in the 
political system about synfuel and reaffirm Jordon's viewpoint on Section 29 
credits.  This is big issue and without this reaffirmation I believe we will 
have approval issues with RAC and others.  I want Jeff and/or I in the 
meeting.

 Doug -

 Thanks for the message and let me be the first to welcome you to the Dabhol 
team.  Please send a copy of the FMA to Bruce Lundstrom and his team for 
review.   One of us will get back to you to discuss a way forward.  

 That aside, I'm pretty impressed with your "third party beneficiary" 
proposal.  Did you learn that in Hainan?

Subject: EFI/DPC FMA

In light of the impending arbitration proceedings between DPC and MSEB should 
we file a third party beneficiary claim against MSEB regarding the Fuel 
Management Agreement? The FMA is not part of Enron's equity in the plant, but 
is directly related to MSEB's performance under the PPA. EFI is due $2.5 
million per year in monthly installments, fluctuating with the plant's 
availibility and based on DPC being paid by MSEB. Currently $13.8 million of 
MTM value and approximately $21 million of acurral (non PV dollars) is at 
risk on Enron's books. The DPC plant went commercial in May, 1998 so there 
are seventeen (17) years left on the FMA. What if anything should we do to 
protect EFI's interest?

My sincerest thanks to all of you that were able to attend the JDF Kick-off

for those of you not familiar with JDF to find out what the JDF Walk is all 
about.  For those of you that were not able to join us, we missed you and we 
look forward to having you join us for our future sessions.

kick-off meeting we will be distributing supplies and gift bags, reviewing 
important details about our campaign, learning more about JDF, and discussing 
our fundraising goal for this year's campaign.  Enron has been the number 1 
walk team in Houston for 5 years in a row and we plan to continue in that 
position and we need your help to make it happen!

Philippe,

I did talk to Skilling about this.  I must have forgotten to call you.  Jeff 
really does want it around, you were correct.  Is there a compromise solution 
here?  Maybe a smaller room with a control center vs an entire floor?  Think 
about items like that and lets discuss.  At this point in time, lets not 
assume we have the option to move it from the new building, at least not all 
of it.  One key consideration is the cost savings by moving it to Ardmore.  
How much will it really save?  Those numbers a long with all the other points 
might bring clarity to what we should do.

Thanks,
Mike

Mike,

Jenny and I have been thinking about the new building, I want to minimise the 
amount of space dedicated to a data center Skilling is (from what
Bill Donovan says) keen to have a state of the art data center that he can 
take visitors to. I think that given our notorious inability to plan for 
space 
at this company (We are out of space in London already 18months ahead of 
schedule), I would like to convince Jeff not to have a large DC in 
the new building and add to Ardmore which would on a per square foot basis be 
significantly cheaper we would have the added benefit  of having
an extra floor available in the new building!

I think this is the best thing to do for Enron.


Let me know what you think

Philippe

A quick heads-up.  Our initial VAR calculations from Bjorn suggest a current 
increase in John's VAR from $8.3MM to $11.5MM in total.  Bjorn is still 
working with Scott Earnest in regard to position limits.  

A few other facts from Rick Causey's meeting yesterday with Mike Patrick and 
Rodney Faldyn.  Rick asked questions regarding (1) how EGM would manage these 
positions, (2) how we would manage the securities law issue of short-swing 
profits (Section 16 in the SEC 1934 Act) regarding the FAS 140 and the 
restructure of the subordinated units in 3Q on which corporate development is 
working, (3) disclosure of the transaction and sensitivities due to the 
affiliated parties and (4) whether or not the FAS 125/140 structure makes the 
most sense versus other EWS earnings.  I may need to ask you guys to call 
Rick on #4 to let him know how important this is for EGM and that Stan and 
Rod are comfortable with the FAS 125/140 deal.  John and I will follow-up 
with Rick on #1.  We are working on structuring around issue #2 and we will 
be working with Koenig's group next week regarding issue #3.  We are 
currently in discussions with AA regarding their recommendation concerning 
disclosure which will be the input for which Rex Rogers and Mark Koenig will 
be looking.  Thanks.

=20
executed online.  That number has been higher, as much as 90% for certain=
=20
months or when we are trying something new or moving a particular product. =
=20
Also, as Bid/Ask spreads tighten, which we would expect, that bodes well fo=
r=20
EOL and our (and the markets) ability to transact even more quickly. =20
Transactions that took days to put together now can be done in 1 second. =
=20
Between the speed and the cost savings of having a fully integrated system,=
=20
we believe that our transaction numbers and percentages of online business=

will significantly increase.

Changes in the industry
We discussed changes that we believe are coming in the industry.  We see=20
several things on the horizon.  We expect the acceptance of the online=20
transactions to further increase; especially with the volatile price=20
movements what we have seen in the last 6 months.  We are currently=20

e=20
acceptance of online business and it gets down to the best prices and=20

Guy, FYI.  Is anyone familiar with this?  Mike is looking for some feedback.  
It looks very premature and not worth a lot of time but he may need us to 
talk with them to help him with his business down there.  Any comments?

Michael, I have the following comments to the Nodocero.com project.

Currently works as a platform where buyers and sellers agree on a price 
through an auction process (brokerage fee)
They aim at becoming a regulated market with standardised contracts. (subject 
to market and regulatory evolution)
Their value drivers are the "Payment Guarantee" (through an insurance 
company) and "Backoffice" (registration before regulatory authorities). None 
of these issues are definitely solved (no agreement with Insurance Co. and if 
any transaction is done now, all the backoffice procedures have to be done 
manually with their employees).
No technological partner yet. They have developed the web site platform (you 
can see it at www.nodocero.com), but I understand that they don't have the 
rest of the technological components required (database, operations, clearing 
system, other). 

Apart from this, I would consider the following issues:

Currently there is no regulated market for this sector of the economy 
(Argentina and the rest of Latin America). Therefore their idea of becoming 
one is good.
The competitors in this race are: Nodocero.com - aXesoEnergia.com - 
EnergyVex.com - Rofex (Rosario Futures Exchange) - other.
No competitor has yet taken an important lead in this race. aXesoEnergia.com 
is doing an important investment in marketing, but it currently works via an 
auction process and does not provide any further service like guarantee or 
backoffice.
One of the competitors will eventually succeed in becoming the reference 
market.
Nodocero.com has no strategic partner yet. (this could be taken as positive 
or negative)

The attached file is their business plan

Mike and Jeff:

I met with Greg yesterday to follow up on the meeting we had last week with 
you (Jeff).  Greg asked to see an estimate of how much money we think this 
endeavor will really cost (a copy was delivered to your office today).

We modeled two scenarios, both assume we buy WebModal.  We Modeled a base 
case of trading volume, and then cut that in half.  Details are in the 
presentation.

The basic conclusion is that this will be a much more expensive endeavor to 
start than our traditional markets (coal, paper, weather, etc.), but 
substantially less than EBS or EES.  Year one costs including capital, IT, 
and people is expected to be approximately $43mm.  That is slightly offset by 
$10mm in revenue.   All of these numbers assume that we are fully staffed for 
the whole year, which is unrealistic, so for 2001, the staffing costs are 
slightly exaggerated.

Anyway, the conclusion was that Greg was going to recommend to Frevert that 
we pursue the business and WebModal.  He expected to talk to him next week.  
Until then, we will try to finalize a Dash.

I will be out next week, but reachable.

Thanks for your help,

Dan

Juiced

By Julia King and Gary H. Anthes
(Nov. 20, 2000) Wall Street analysts and oil industry executives were thick 
among the legion of skeptics who thought Enron Corp. President and Chief 
Operating Officer Jeff Skilling was nuts to launch a Web site for the trading 
of natural gas and electricity over the Internet. 
That was last November, before EnronOnline locked up more than $120 billion 
in transactions in its first few months of operation, quickly establishing 
itself as the world's largest e-commerce company. As of Oct. 11, just prior 
to Enron's report of its third-quarter earnings, EnronOnline had executed 
more than 350,000 transactions, representing a gross value of $183 billion. 
Since then, the $40 billion Houston-based energy giant has elbowed its way 
into several new diversified markets. And it plans to continue its push into 
many more, ranging from railcar cargo space to broadband networking and 
data-storage capacity. 
In doing so, Enron is turbocharging its transformation from a stodgy, 
old-line fuel company to an entirely new kind of business-to-business market 
maker, with information technology and an all-out emphasis on 
entrepreneurship at the heart of its New Economy operations. Enron has been 
so successful in leveraging IT to pioneer new markets that others are trying 
to emulate its approach. 







First to Market 
"Enron often introduces a product before the competition even senses a market 
exists," the company says in its latest annual report. A prime example: 
online trading of data-network capacity. 
Indeed, "there's a low degree of awareness [among carriers] about the 
bandwidth-trading business," and Enron is ahead of the game, says Seth Libby, 
an analyst at The Yankee Group in Boston. 
At present, there are only a handful of network professionals who are aware 
of these capacity commoditization plans, says Libby. But not for long, 
asserts Enron President?? Jeff Skilling. "Within five years, the bandwidth 
market may be bigger than the gas and electric markets," he says. "So for us, 
it could be as big as the rest of our existing energy business." That's 
currently a $35 billion business. 
But critics say trading bandwidth is much more complicated than trading gas, 
especially for a company with little depth in telecommunications. And critics 
add that although carriers stand to benefit from the ability to buy and sell 
capacity, they might prefer to do it through some channel that's independent 
of the control of a single market maker like Enron. 
"Enron's argument is that its trading capabilities are the differentiator, 
and that it need not have deep telecom expertise," says Lisa Pierce, an 
analyst at Giga Information Group in Stamford, Conn. "But I'm not convinced 
it's that simple. Technology isn't a long-term competitive differentiator." 
Houston-based Enron Broadband Services Inc., formed last year, offers IP 
transport on its 15,000-mile fiber-optic network. Enron Broadband Services 
also trades - that is, makes a market by buying and selling - network 
capacity to and from other data carriers, conducting some of the transactions 
on EnronOnline. 
Enron Broadband Services also offers content-oriented services, such as a 
video-on-demand service it will market with Dallas-based Blockbuster Inc. to 
home viewers starting next month. 
"When we started the gas business, they told us we were nuts," Skilling says. 
"They said, 'You're going to sell gas but not own production? How does that 
work?' Then we did electricity and they said we were nuts again, and even 
louder than before. They said this stuff moves at the speed of light; you can 
never create a market. Then in telecommunications, they said we were nuts 
again." 
Despite its share of skeptics, some experts like Enron's prospects in this 
space. "I think aspects of this have the potential to be very big," says 
Libby. "The carriers like the idea of instantaneous provisioning. And I think 
it has a lot of potential [for] . . . selling it to businesses and giving 
them the ability to cut their costs significantly by buying it as they need 
it." 





"We aspire to that kind of model," says Fred Buehler, director of electronic 
business at Eastman Chemical Co. in Kingsport, Tenn. 
"In every sector, there will be one or two innovators who get out front and 
do things differently to create shareholder value," Buehler says. "We're 
trying to be one of them." 
Market Maker 
Stroll through the gas-trading section on the 32nd floor of Enron's 
glistening 50-story headquarters, and the company's technological 
sophistication is immediately evident. Traders like 26-year-old John Arnold, 
who personally executes about $1 billion per day in trades, have real-time 
access to virtually any information that might affect their split-second 
buy-and-sell decisions. 
That information might be a meteorologist's prediction of a 
colder-than-normal winter across the Plains states or a live news report of 
political instability in an oil-producing country in the Middle East. 
Behind the scenes, all of Arnold's trades are instantly analyzed and 
processed by a sophisticated, proprietary risk-management system and then 
updated across multiple back-end computer systems worldwide. Less than a year 
after launching the operation, 60% of the world's gas is traded on 
EnronOnline. 
"What we are doing, no one in the industry did 10 years ago. Eighty percent 
of our income this year is from businesses that didn't exist 10 years ago," 
says Skilling. 
For example, EnronOnline contributed heavily to its parent company's 
third-quarter earnings, which were up 31% to $292 million, compared with the 
same period last year. 
"The change is technology-driven," Skilling adds. "We couldn't do what we do 
without massive amounts of computing capability." In this regard, Enron joins 
a short list of companies that includes Wal-Mart Stores Inc., FedEx Corp. and 
American Airlines Inc., which famously pioneered various mission-critical IT 
techniques to leapfrog competitors and create a whole new class of IT-enabled 
industry leaders. 
Among Enron's boldest ideas is its use of a single, powerful software-based 
trading platform to insert itself as a principal buyer or seller in hundreds 
of different markets. Currently, Enron trades more than 1,000 different 
commodities, such as gold, natural gas and metals, on EnronOnline. 
"The core of our business is our business model, which is a centralized 
risk-management and market-making business model. It just so happens that the 
Internet is just perfect for improving the efficiency of that model," 
Skilling says. 
But as a market maker, EnronOnline stands alone. For starters, unlike most 
other Internet marketplaces, it's free. There are no transaction fees or 
catalog, inventory or subscription costs for users. 
"Enron has broken away from the pack in the last year, in terms of their 
capital growth," says Ian Wylie, vice president of e-business at BP Amoco PLC 
in London. "And e-business is responsible for a lot of this change." 
Even more unusual is Enron's role as a principal in each transaction. That 
means Enron is either the buyer or seller in every trade in which it's 
involved, unlike market makers that simply act as matchmakers between buyers 
and sellers. 
In fact, Skilling, as well as Mike McConnell, who heads EnronOnline's global 
expansion efforts as president and CEO of Enron Global Markets LLC, dismisses 
much of the current hyperactivity surrounding other fee-based 
business-to-business exchanges as a flash in the pan. 
"[Many of the] B2B guys think all you have to do is set up a bulletin board 
and people will start transacting, but it doesn't work that way," Skilling 
says. "You need to know you can deliver if push comes to shove." 
As either the seller or buyer in all of its trades, Enron, an established 
brand name with 32,000 miles of pipeline and deep financial pockets, 
guarantees delivery or payment on all trades that are executed on 
EnronOnline. 
"We're creating markets that were highly illiquid, so someone has to put 
their reputation on the line to say, 'We'll deliver,' " Skilling says. 
But guaranteeing delivery also requires having guaranteed access to physical 
assets such as network bandwidth and papermaking plants. Guaranteed access 
also ensures marketplace liquidity. For Enron, this is where the bricks and 
mortar come in. 
For example, to help drive its liquidity in the pulp and paper market, Enron 
paid $72 million in July for Garden State Paper Co., a recycled-newsprint 
mill in Garfield, N.J. 
Skilling's current market fancy is metals, and in May, Enron bought MG PLC, a 
London-based metals marketer. "You have to break the liquidity logjam, and to 
do that, you have to take a risk position," Skilling says. 
But once the logjam is cleared, Enron is just as likely to sell off the 
brick-and-mortar assets it acquired and use the cash to invest in new 
business. 
For example, to finance its new bandwidth-trading operation, Enron is selling 
Portland General Electric Co., a Portland, Ore.-based power producer that it 
bought in 1997, so it could bring liquidity to and guarantee trades in the 
online electricity market. 
Eventually, Enron may end up trading commodities that aren't even considered 
commodities - at least not at the moment - such as data storage capacity or 
empty railcar space. 
"Might we move into sauces or meats or grains? Potentially," says McConnell, 
who was Enron's de facto CIO before moving into his current role. 
"You have to be creative every day," McConnell says. "You have to be 
open-minded to trying new things." 
But what remains constant throughout all the upsizing and downsizing is 
Enron's core IT-enabled business model, which is what puts it in a class of 
its own, analysts say. 
"People have talked a lot about systems that they're about to roll out, but 
there is just not much out there for direct trading," says Mike Heim, an 
energy analyst at A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis. "Enron rolled out 
its technology 10 months ago, and still there isn't much else out there. 
There hasn't been much competition [because] there isn't anybody in the same 
class." 
But just last month, Houston-based Dynegy Inc. launched Dynegydirect, an 
Internet-based, commission-free trading site for energy and communications 
commodities. 
Also last month, IntercontinentalExchange in Atlanta, whose partners include 
BP Amoco and The Hague-based Royal Dutch/Shell Group, added natural gas and 
power to its online trading system, which already included precious metals 
and crude oil. 
Skilling doesn't get called "nuts" much anymore. In fact, he's a darling on 
Wall Street, where Enron's stock has soared from around $40 per share last 
November to $81 as of this Nov. 2. As a result, Enron - by all accounts, an 
Old Economy gas pipeline company until 12 months ago - is widely regarded as 
a New Economy pioneer. 
Says Skilling, "We like to say we were B2B before there was B2B." 

Thriving On the Unconventional 
As head of two Enron pipeline subsidiaries, Mike McConnell knew a lot more 
about gas flows than he did about data flows last year when he got a surprise 
call from Enron President and Chief Operating Officer Jeff Skilling. 
Recalls McConnell, "Jeff went into this whole thought process about how the 
Internet is changing everything. He said, 'We need to make Enron an 
e-business, and I need a guy that can run this as a business. We need to 
change the way we view technology.' 
"I thought he was a little crazy and I said, 'Jeff, I'm not a technology 
person at all,' He said, 'No, seriously - this is going to be big.' So I took 
over as CEO of Enron Global Technology," and thus became the company's de 
facto CIO, McConnell explains. 
Appointing a person with no technology background to the top IT post is an 
unusual move. But Enron often defies convention and typically thrives as a 
result. Indeed, Enron boasts an entrepreneurial culture that's unusual in 
large, long-established companies, and in utilities firms in particular. 
McConnell relates the tale of how 29-year-old Louise Kitchen, Enron's head 
gas trader in Europe, spearheaded the creation of an online gas-trading 
system, recruiting IT people from elsewhere in the company to do the 
development work. Word of the Web-based platform, EnronOnline, which is 
literally remaking the company, didn't reach top management until a few weeks 
before it went live. 
Kitchen enlisted the support of Enron's initially skeptical top traders, and 
she scoured the company for software developers and other experts. Her small 
army of volunteers worked nights and weekends on the project while carrying 
on with their regular jobs. 
"It's an amazing story about not getting corporate approval and going through 
all the bureaucracy," McConnell says. "No one went to the board and said, 'We 
want to change the way we trade.' You just do it." 
Glowing Endorsement 
Soon after McConnell became the de facto CIO of the $40 billion energy 
company, he joined eight of Sun Microsystems Inc.'s top Houston customers at 
a breakfast hosted by Sun CEO Scott McNealy. 
"I was very nervous," recalls McConnell, 40. "I mean, McNealy is the guy, and 
here I know nothing about technology. I'd been on the job maybe two weeks." 
McNealy asked the attendees - all but McConnell were middle-aged CIOs with 
many years of IT experience - to introduce themselves in turn. 
"When Scott came to me, I said, 'I'm the CEO of Global Technology, and we 
want to be the leader in B2B commerce in the world.' He kind of sat back and 
said, 'How long have you been in the IT business?' " McConnell explains. " 
'About nine days,' I said, 'and we are going to take a little bit different 
approach to technology.' Scott chuckled and said, 'That sounds like Enron; it 
always looks at things differently.' He then stated that my CEO title and 
Enron's approach were very unusual but that it would be more commonplace 
soon, as this was the way of the future." 
McConnell says McNealy's endorsement had "a huge impact" on how he structured 
IT at Enron during the following year. 
"I realized that we weren't too late to change our approach and take a 
commercial view of technology," he says - a view of IT as an integral part of 
the business, not as something that supports business functions. "None of the 
other companies were thinking our new way at all." 
Taking a commercial view of IT has led to a blurring of the line that 
traditionally separates IT organizations from the business units they 
support. When McConnell became CEO of Global Technology, Enron had five CIOs 
who were predominantly operating independently inside the company's major 
lines of business. 
"Each CIO had his own agenda, his own thought process, his own goals, and 
they did not communicate at all," he says. 
McConnell established corporate standards for IT, created a management team 
that included the five CIOs and put all IT people under a new chief 
technology officer, Philippe Bibi. 
But IT is far from centralized at Enron. "We wanted to make people think 
about technology not as IT and support, but as an extension of your 
business," he explains. "So we seeded people out into the business units. 
[IT] directs the performance review process, but the business units have the 
greatest influence on where the person actually ranks and is rated." 
Firms like Enron that merge IT departments with the business units they serve 
will be the winners among fast-paced e-businesses, says IT organization 
expert Robert Zawacki, president of Zawacki and Associates in Colorado 
Springs and a professor emeritus at the University of Colorado, also in 
Colorado Springs. "We need more entrepreneurial leaders in IT, and 
[McConnell] is certainly one," he says. 
IT makes it easier to be entrepreneurial, says McConnell, who is now 
president and CEO of Enron Global Markets. "We really do like to try things 
and see what happens, and when you have an electronic platform like 
[EnronOnline] that we can model into different sectors, it's very inexpensive 
to try it. We are not afraid; if it's not working, we'll just stop." - Gary 
H. Anthes and Julia King

Jay,

 Howdy from Houston.  I bet it is cooler in NY.

I don't really have any other ideas as you addressed below except I changed 
the word "his" to "the" investment group.  As far as other clarification of 
duties, I don't have any issue with it, but every CEO will call me and ask if 
this is a change in how they deal with Alan or investments.  What is the 
status with Steve and how the group is organized?  Did you talk with him and 
let him know that he is a stand alone dealmaker with an area of concentration?

Is that your official assigned work number?  If not, we need to get one 
assigned before the email goes out.  Also, I am assuming that this is in the 
MG office not the small Enron office, is that accurate?  Greg and I both 
think that the MG office is the best location and will help them assimilate 
with Enron.

Thanks,
Mike 

PS, good luck in the move

1)  I'm not sure it is appropriate to get into organizational details of how 
diiferent units will work together in an organizational memo.  We are working 
well communicating with and sharing deals between and amongst the various 
groups/business units on an informal basis.  Formalization of this process 
here adds litlle, and may detract.

2)  How else do I refer to it other than Steve and his group in the context 
in which this is written.  Suggestions appreciated!

P.S.  I know I owe you an accomplishments list, but as of now, I don't really 
know of too many for 1H2000.  I do not like to be too creative with these

I like it.

  Two questions. 
1. You didn't address how our investment group will work with other groups, 
specifically, EEL, ENA will (may) be different than how it works (and 
approves) investments with the investments from the other business groups.
2.  You still called it Steve's group.  Do you want to address the issue more

What are your thoughts?

Jon,
     For your information we have established contact with Siemens via their 
representative in Houston, Mr Mark Tartaglio, and he has identified Mr 
Friedrich Heimann (Siemens Germany) as the appropriate person for us to 
present our request.  Although we have not yet actually spoken directly with 
Mr Heimann, we understand that he is working to coordinate a meeting at their 
offices in Germany for Enron with certain persons from Siemens and the target 
date for this meeting is November 15 or 16.  It was also agreed that we would 
conduct a conference call prior to that date to better explain to Siemens 
what we are requesting and to explore whether the plant O&M costs would be 
impacted by the requested changes.  I speculate that we will have a meeting 
in Germany, but probably after next week.  It seems to me that it would also 
be a good idea if someone form FGPC could attend.
Regards,
Mike

Hello from S America.  I would recommend 2 people.  Both are obvious but 
Louise Kitchen should do EOL and Ken Rice is the best candidate for EBS.  If 
they aren't available they can pick an appropriate person.

Mike,

Who should we contact about getting Enron Broadband and Enron Online active
with Interactive Texas (see www.interactivetexas.com)?  With such a broad
cross-section of the state's senior leaders participating, including
Skilling, Interactive Texas is going to be a major event.  We need to make
certain Enron gets early access to exhibit or sponsorship opportunities.

Working with Amitava Dhar,  Vasant Shanbhogue and John Best,  we completed 
the following analysis to determine max loss for our portfolio of 
transactions for the balance of 2001.

A Model simulation yields max loss of less than $60 million for our total 
portfolio in 2001.

 Comments:  We ran several simulations in the model with 10,000 trials 
showing a max loss without hedges of $49,500,000 - $52,000,000. In 
otherwords, the  highest possible loss experienced in all runs was less than 
$52 million.  We also ran one simulation at 30,000 trials and the max loss 
did not vary   significantly from the earlier trials. Our conclusion from the 
results of the model runs is that the 1 in 100,000 trial would produce a max 
loss (P99.999) of less  than $60 million vs the notional P100 payout of $280 
million.

 This does not address the "Venus falling into the Sun" scenario. Since 
running the simulation does not produce a max loss approaching the P100, we 
had  to go outside the model and create a spread sheet that would force a 
scenario that generated the full loss.

B.  Worst case scenario of all units down on day 1 hits maximum payout of 
$280 million over 5 days.

 Comments: In the spread sheet we assumed an unrealistic scenario that all 
units go down on day one for 5 days. Taking the total MWh covered for each  
unit, we then calculated the power price necessary to hit the maximum dollar 
payout for each unit given a 5 day outage. The 5 day price spike for each  
power market ranged from $1,500 in Entergy to $700 in PJM. Under this 
unrealistic scenario we would reach our maximum payout of $280 million in 5 
days.

C. Power option hedges generate offsetting cash value of $ 215 million, 
reducing our net P100 exposure to less than $65 million

 Comments: We then layered our proposed hedging strategy on top of the 
unrealistic spread sheet scenario in 2 above. Assuming the 5 day price spike  
replicated the forward curve in the MidWest during 1999, a spot market at 
$1,500 pulled forward prices up to a range of $250-$300/MWh. The option   
hedges we would put in place would cost $14-15 million and would yield $215mm 
in positive MTM to offset the payout  of $280 million, giving us the net  
Maximun risk of $65 million.

We need to present our calculations to Vince tomorrow morning to get his sign 
off and can then go over the analysis in detail with you and Greg immediately 
afterwards. We are still not recommending we put the full hedge in place to 
cover this unrealistic scenareo, but the analysis shows we can significantly 
cover the tail risk in our book without having insurance in place. Our 
recommendation remains to put a smaller hedge in place while we continue to 
pursue a insurance partner during the month of June.

Speak to you tomorrow.

Mark,

Here is the org memo draft we discussed.  I sent it to you yesterday but 
found a rejection notice on your address this morning.  Here it is again.
I'm in all day and tomorrow if you want to discuss.

Subject: draft org. memo

Mark and David,

Below is my first stab at the organization memo.  I didn't over focus on 
specific wording and I am not sure how you want to address the various groups 
that will be affected.  I believe we need to address all of them by name and 
they should probably be in alpha order as to not upset anyone on the order.

I also didn't know any other information that you may want to include with 
regard to the successes from the group year to date.  
Greg, Jeff and I are getting together for lunch tomorrow to discuss the New 
Works organization.  

I think that this should come from Enron's office of the Chairman vs. the 
business units because it does affect 2 different lines of business and it 
will have more impact and clarity for the other groups especially, my 
departure from Net Works.

After you guys pretty this up (and destroy it) please send it back via email 
and i'll make sure and coordinate with Whalley.

Thanks,
Mike

Vance, I've been attempting to call you .  Your voicemail is full and my 
return voicemail keeps getting rejected.  I suggest you clear out some room.  
I would be happy to change my schedule and meet either at 12 or 12:30.  I 
don't really want an hour with him but will do what you need.

All,

Attached is the first draft of an EGM update and org memo.  Please take a few 
minutes and review, add what is necessary for your section and return ASAP.   
Other comments are welcome as well.    I would like to get this at on Friday 
evening or early next week.   Please do so on a hard copy and have brought 
up.  I will incorporate your changes. Some of the changes in the memo are 
still under consideration and need to be considered extremely confidential.  
This needs a lot of work and filler.  Also add a one line update or positive 
statement about your business as an intro line of the section.   

Thanks,
mike

I hope some of these help.  They are similar in nature but may have different 
pieces inlcuded in them.  I recommend flipping through them quickly and 
eliminate extras or ones that you don't need.

Call me if you need anything else.

Ken and Kevin,

Attached, for your information, is  a copy of a general presentation that I 
prepared to illustrate and describe EGM's businesses.  This is a presentation 
that will become a "living" document to communicate our businesses and 
growth.  I will be making numerous changes as we move closer to the analyst 
meeting in January but I wanted to give everyone a copy of this version.

With all of your history on these businesses, I thought you might be 
interested in our approach and description.

Please don't hesitate to call me if you have any questions or comments.

Mike

Nissho Iwai (project Sato):  We have spent a considerable amount of time over 
the last couple of weeks defining what Enron could do for them and building a 
level of trust and understanding.  Recall that a couple of their board 
members had come to us about a month ago to discuss a USD2-3 billion near 
term liquidity "issue".  On Friday their strategy planning group will be 
taking the proposal of cooperation with Enron to their president and some of 
their key advisors at Sanwa Bank and DKB.  We have proposed the means 
(without specific definition) of how we could provide near term liquidity and 
set the path to look for opportunities in key business areas.  Almost all the 
areas of interest are in key Global Market products.  Sanwa and DKB are part 
of the equation as they worked out a rescue deal for NI a year ago.  This 
plan also had the support from Hiyami (former NI president and now head of 
BOJ).  So any decision to handle their near term problems and future growth 
would have to get support from these key groups.  The NI team we have been 
working with seem quite positive on their prospects of getting this through 
Friday's meeting.  From this point we would proceed with a very detailed due 
diligence effort across key areas which will be mutually defined, but 
would/could include: LNG, coal, petchems, shipping, freight, metals, etc.  We 
would determine how much we could pay for certain rights and/or positions.  
If we could get something done this would have a huge impact on the market 
and would give us tremendous reach to other Japanese customers in their 
group.  During this "liquidity solution" phase, we will also be evaluating 
areas of growth and of mutual interest to our companies.

Hitachi: weather ventures: The #3 guy in Hitachi came to us a couple of weeks 
ago indicating that they thought there could be tremendous possibilities for 
Enron and Hitachi to jointly market weather products in Japan.  Note:  we 
have been discussing possibilities with Hitachi since Ken Lay visited.  
Hitachi does not have any weather experience, but does have a tremendous 
customer base, a large sales force and a very strong name in Japan.  As 
Hitachi are involved in just about everything, they also have business lines 
in the capital markets area and insurance.  Hitachi senior management has 
strongly implied that if we can get something done then they can deliver 
quite a few companies including the large utilities.  They could also give us 
access to the Japanese insurance companies... beyond the Marine and Fires.  I 
believe that the president of Hitachi has already decided that they want to 
do this.  In fact, in true Japanese style, they have mentioned to TEPCO that 
they would be pursing something like this with Enron to "sort of" get 
permission.  Hitachi could be quite useful in getting us further access to 
the utes for fuel deals as well.  What we have contemplated (and discussed 
with Tawney) is an arrangement where Enron provides the pricing for standard 
and structured products and takes on the risk of transactions (risk books 
outside venture) while Hitachi provides the customers and a trained sales 
force.  In return, Hitachi gets some sort of agency fee for each deal done.  
Hitachi also has tremendous weather risk themselves that they would be 
looking to manage from a corporate level.  They have wanted to race to an 
MOU, but we have brought them back to a CA first.  We'll be getting more 
definition over the next couple of weeks with the idea of having advanced and 
productive discussion with Tawney when he is over the middle of next month.  
Needless to say, getting something like this done with Hitachi would be a 
tremendous boost to our local credibility and would open many doors.

Nissho Iwai: methanol:  We will be presenting an indicative term sheet to 
Deutsche Bank tomorrow concerning a prepay structure for 100k+ tons of 
Methanol for up to three years out of Bontang.  We have been able to work 
down the CDS spreads from the international market for Indonesia and NI down 
from 1750 bps over Libor to approx 600.  The structure would likely involve a 
trade finance arrangement with one of the Japanese banks (with sufficient 
Bank of Indonesia deposits) providing coverage for the Bank of Indonesia who 
would provide the local performance gtee.  This is a unique arrangement that 
the Jp banks have with Indonesia.  Also the general feeling amongst Jp 
trading companies and banks is that they are already pregnant with Indonesia 
and a little more doesn't matter.  Basically Indonesia is in the national 
security interest of Japan and therefore Jp govt and institutions will 
provide support.  I have mentioned the possibility of this to Stu to consider 
other ways to manage coal risks.  Prepay would likely be in the range of 
USD30-40 million.  Nowlan has indicated the possibility of greater volumes, 
so will work variables as we get feedback from NI/DB.  For a more detailed 
discussion see internal writeup:

Morten Erik,

Thanks for the email.  I thought it was very thorough and hits all the main 
points that we are thinking about right now.  Jeff and I are very bullish on 
the opportunities in Japan are just now focusing on the specifics.  I believe 
that will also drive the structure.  You should have received an EGM overview 
yesterday and it will be an excellent brief on what we are doing and our 
general direction.  I am very interested in having both you and Joe look at 
that and provide feedback on the opportunities in Japan.  
 
We can talk about all of your issues later, when we are more prepared, but on 
the PRC issue, the key is not simply P&L but on transactions and growing the 
business.   I believe that these businesses with proper focus and dedication 
can grow quickly and show success even though the margins may be small.

I am glad that you are coming over and also touring Enron Europe and ENA.  It 
will help you make a better decision and we will have all of this clarified 
in the mean time.  Jeff and I will be talking about some of these points 
tomorrow as well.

Thanks,
Mike

Gentlemen:

 Attached is the DASH for the approval of the DPR Accelerated Put 
transaction.  This partial divestiture allows us to put $11 million of our 
equity interest back to DPR Holding Company, LLC and its subsidiary, Dakota, 
LLC.  Both entities are controlled by Chris Cline.

 In addition to redeeming part of our equity interest, the deal provides us 
900,000 tons of coal priced below market, an option which could lead to a 
very profitable synfuel project, and the potential for more marketing fees 
from other Cline entities.

 The DASH has been approved and signed by RAC and JEDI II, and is now 
awaiting Mark Haedicke's review and approval.  I wanted to give you the 
opportunity to review the DASH and become familiar with the provisions of the 
deal.

 If you have any questions on the transaction, feel free to contact me at 
(412) 490-9048.  Others familiar with the deal are Mike Beyer, George 
McClellan, and Wayne Gresham.

 Thank you.

  Bill Giuliani

Understood.  I will be in CA next week meeting with Socal and PGE.  With 
Socal, we plan to discuss their storage capabilities - to take vaporized LNG 
and provide a balancing service.  With PG&E we'll be looking for points where 
they could take gas into their system.  We wanted to be fairly specific, but 
not tip our hand regarding project timing or exact location.  Socal is 
scheduled to release their system study (to receive LNG) tomorrow.

I've requested a meeting next Friday in San Francisco with Jeff Dasovich 
(regulatory) and Sandi McCubbin (legislative) to explain our concept and get 
their input.  On Thursday, we meet with Samuel Wehn, works for Dave Parquet, 
who will tell us how he's permitted power plants in CA.  We'll ask for 
suggestions on local law & engineering firms, plus see what Sam can do to 
help us.

Any instructions?  If not, I'll proceed as planned.

Kurt, 

I agree with Eric.   California is very dangerous right now and we would need 
something very real to bring this to his attention.  Steve Kean  really liked 
the idea but only after we were ready to rock and roll.

Kurt,

I spoke to Ken roughly a month ago regarding our desire to have a terminal on 
the west coast.  His initial impression was that given the climate there for 
new build asset approvals this would be extremely difficult.  He preferred 
the Mexico import idea.  Before we ask Ken to get involved I think we need at 
least a skeleton of a project.

Mike/Eric,

Jody Crook & I met this afternoon with Robert Neustadter to review Socal 
storage tariffs.  Robert explained that he had been working flat out to 
prepare materials for Ken Lay who left this morning with Jeff Dasovich to 
meet with senior government officials in California to discuss solutions to 
the energy crisis.

Might be an opportunity to drop the message that we are working on LNG 
solutions and hope to get the politicians support when we make definitive 
proposals?

The attached presentations contain some Enron slides that you have used 
previously.  I am sending two more emails with other presentations.  I did 
not separate them out for the sake of time.  Let me know if you had something

Thanks.

Pelt,

We have made reservations for Fri. and Sat,  I didn't make yours but i would 
move quickly.  Would you like me to set up a tee time and massages for the 
girls?  I figured a 1 pm tee time?  Also what about tickets for the game 
itself.  Will you have access as years gone by or does the search need to 
begin?

We definitely are planning to go to Texas - O.U.  We are considering
staying
at the Four Seasons at Los Colinas.  Possibly a little golf and R & R mixed
in with the game.  It would be a bit out of the way.  We might go up as
early as Friday morning to play golf that afternoon.  Let me know what you
think.

Jonny,

Thank you so much for the email and kind words.  I was very moved by it and
you know I feel the same way.  I have become very reflective with the more
"success" that I have been fortunate enough to receive.  I am so thankful
and appreciative and although I have always been religious and spiritual,
it has grown more deeply.  I see so many people that have lost their
perspective and I pray that I will remain grounded and truly appreciate the
blessings that our family has received.  Chris and I often discuss how we
can help others and what can we do to really make a difference.

The Jones and the McConnells are truly very lucky.   Thanks, and give my
love to your family.

Mike


PS:  What about OU - Texas, do you have any ideas or plans already in the
works?

Sometimes we fail to stop and reflect on events which are of significance
because we are so busy with our heads down accomplishing the things we
strive for.  I hope you are taking a moment to reflect and enjoy the
incredible accomplishments which you have achieved at such a young age.
You

to give back what we have been so fortunate to receive.

Congratulations and keep up the good work.  I am proud to call you my

Dear Mike,

Thank you for the introduction to David Tagliarino.
We spoke at length yesterday, and he seems like a very
good guy.  He also seemed very receptive to the
possibility of us working together, and I am hoping to
schedule a meeting with him in the near future.  In
the meantime, I sent him some information on our
company, and the players we represent.  I am confident
that we can be of help to you, and obviously, we would
appreciate the opportunity to do so.

I know that you have been very successful at Enron,
and I am happy for you.  I am sure things will only
get better.

If I am fortunate enough to schedule a meeting with
David, I would love to stop by your office and say
hello.  I will keep you posted.  In the meantime, I
wish you and your family a happy holiday season, and
again, I appreciate your help.

Sincerely,

David N. Winkle

Mark,

The bigger issue is what are we going to do with EE&CC.  If their time is 
coming and we need to split them up then I would agree with this but 
otherwise I am not sure this is the best thing to do.  I have had very little 
actual work with EE&CC in the past year and can't really comment on their 
effectiveness.

This fundamentally changes the entire basis of our approach to EECC and the

In light of the lesson learned on Project Lightening and in view of the 
recent CALME reorganization, I suggest we simplify the payroll structure for 
Development Engineers (DE's).  Currently, the DE's listed below are still on 
EECC's payroll, although they are direct-line support to the Regions/Business 
Units.  I suggest that all DE's transfer from EECC's payroll to the Business 
Units they are supporting.  Some DE's are already on the regions' payrolls  I 
don't think this will have a budget impact, because at this time each region 
below is paying the total costs for these engineers, through EECC invoices.  
Please let me know if each of you agree and I will have HR do the payroll 
switch.

Thanks for the email.  I would be an angle investor in your 24 hour a day 
extension machine.  If anyone could do it, it would be Sanjay.  I would very 
much like to meet with you.  Jeff as well.  I"ve got several openings that I 
can create on Wed Sept 13th.  10:30 - 11:15, 1:30 - 2:00; 3:30 - 5:00.  

Let me know what works.

Mike,

I saw today's announcement regarding you taking responsibility for the Global 
LNG work. This is great news, and congratulations. And as soon as I fine tune 
my invention for Sanjay of granting more than 24 hours in a day, I'll forward 
it to you also, as you both need it.

I would like for Sanjay and me to have an opportunity to discuss India and 
its LNG potential with you. Both Sanjay and I are in town next week for the 
PRC process, and I am tied up Monday in that and you and Sanjay are busy 
Tuesday with PRC. Would it be possible to visit with you sometime on 
Wednesday, Sept. 13 for 30 to 45 minutes so that we can give you an overview 
of the India LNG market, discuss some opportunities and challenges we have 
learned in our couple of years of marketing to downstream customers, and 
perhaps some things that Enron can do to really take a dominant position in 
the India LNG market? I'll put together a brief overview presentation, and we 
can walk you through that presentation. After our meeting with you, I would 
be happy to discuss this with other members of your new team as well.

Please let me know if a meeting on Wednesday works for your schedule. 

Thanks,
Wade

Subject: Fwd: SEPTEMBER CONFERENCE


Dear Mike,

Rene Ortiz, the recent Minister of Energy for Ecuador (1998-1999) and former
Secretary General of OPEC (1978-83) is Conference Chair for a major gas and
power conference in Quito, September 18-19.  The Conference is expected to
attract key energy leaders from latin America.  I understand that former
Sauid Minister Yamani and Fadil Al Chalabi will also attend.

Rene is an old, old friend.

If this is of interest to you, ENRON please let me know.  From your
description of ENRON ONLINE at the Price School of Business in April, I think
this is a natural.

My Institute for Energy Economics and Policy will also partner with Global
Change Associates and a number of major services providers to hold a major
conference on energy ecommerce in Beijing, May 24-5, 2001. Again if this is
of interest we would welcome ENRON's participation on the program, as a
sponsor and/or an exhibitor.

Please let me know the next time you visit OU.

Best regards,

Dennis O'Brien

Steve,

Sorry for the slow response but I got the latest word on voicemail while out 
here in SF.  They completely screwed up my order, not Ron the guy from 
Mercedes USA, but the dealer.  Ron has stepped in and followed up himself and 
I'll be receiving a 2001 in late August/early Sept..  He is a good guy and is 
trying to make up for the major dropping of the ball.  My sales guy that blew 
it is no longer in that job.  Hopefully it will be coming soon.  I'll believe 
it when i see it but I am very excited and it was a real let down in June 
when it didn't' arrive.

Thanks for asking.

We'll talk soon.

mike

Jeff, as we talked earlier we need to get what you want ASAP because in these 
energy markets , which I think we both agree are not going to settle down any 
time soon, coupled with the growth you and Mike want to see we are operating 
under ridiculously small limits. 8 million VAR for a group our size , with 
our turnover and number of traders just doesn't work. We have 15 to 20 
million of structured deals, primarlily coming from Don S that at this time 
we would have to walk away from. We can not go out and recruit more and 
better traders to have them sit at their desk and not trade do to limits 
which in no way are reflective of the size and risk Enron should be willing 
to take if they truly have bought into this being a significant global 
business. I  suggest they should have raised them already as a reflection of 
where they want to take the business and thought this through prior to the 
move  to Global Markets. You wouldn't be handed a Model T and asked to go out 
and win the Indy 500. We need the tools to make the money and VAR is just as 
important a componenet as leadership,  people, vol limits, systems 
,reporting, etc. 
 We have shut down positions  today, which will cost us significantly, due to 
the VAR issue.  All we seem to be doing now is trading and worrying about VAR 
and NOT doing what we think is right with our positions. This definitely, 
like today, has had a negative impact on P/L.We will get a chance to visit 
this issue  with Chris and John on your visit here next week.

Rebecca,

Philippe being the only other corp officer within the large technology 
organization has an enormous volume of contracts to sign.  A large bulk of 
the signatures that are required come from two areas;  Infrastructure and 
ENA.  I would like to have 2 current Vice Presidents within the business 
units made corp VPs:  Beth Pearlman and Jenny Rub.

Can we make this happen and when would it occur?

Thanks,
Mike

Subject: CATS litigation

Disappointingly, the House of Lords ruled 5 - 0 against Enron in the CATS 
litigation today.  This will mean that we will repay to the CATS parties 
approximately $150 million plus interest and court costs, putting the final 
figure at an estimated $155-160 million.  We expect to be invoiced for the 
principal amount in the next week or so; sorting costs and interest may take 
as long as 60 days.  The written opinion reflects a determination on the part 
of the Lords to rule against us regardless of what the contract says.  The 
opinion seeks to conclude "what rational businessmen could have intended" 
rather than applying the provisions of the contract.  

For example, Lord Hoffman (author of the primary opinion) makes it clear that 
the  "retrospective consequences" of discovering a latent defect after 
payments have been made (and would therefore need to be refunded) are 
unacceptable.  His view seems to be that because we were not ready to flow 
J-Block gas during the period of the T-6 leak, we are not damaged and 
therefore not entitled to relief under the contract.  Furthermore, he says 
that the Commencement Date notice sent by the CATS parties was in the nature 
of a declaration and as long as it is sent in good faith it is effective.

As far as the price reduction formula in Clause 7.5, Lord Hoffman opines that 
the clause is not operative until TGTL had tied in the J-Block field.  The 
contract makes no reference to this requirement.  Hoffman's view is that it 
is only upon tie-in that the CATS parties' obligation to provide the 
Transportation Service is triggered and therefore there can be no price 
reduction for not providing the service unless tie-in is complete. This 
statement is in stark contrast with Hoffman's earlier statement in the 
opinion that upon the giving of the Commencement Date notice the CATS parties 
have an absolute obligation to provide the Transportation Service.

Equally disappointing and surprising is the fact that the Lords rejected our 
submission for reimbursement of our costs incurred in connection with the 
restitution issue.  As you may recall, restitution was the primary issue upon 
which the CATS parties obtained leave to appeal, and they conceded the point 
at the commencement of the hearing.  Reimbursement of these costs should have 
been a given. 

Although I have not yet been able to speak to our most senior barrister, our 
other counsel have assessed the opinion as "appalling" and "pathetic," and 
describe the situation as one where Enron has been "stitched up".  
Unfortunately, given that this is the court of last resort in this country 
(except of course the Court of Human Rights), there is not an avenue for 
recourse.

In conclusion may I say that although we did not get the result we wanted or 
expected from the House of Lords, I very much appreciate all the support from 
each of you for these past six years.  The case has been a roller coaster 
ride;  I hope our earlier victory in the Court of Appeal will evidence in 
fact that some tribunals in this country recognize that we did get it right. 

Please call me if you wish to discuss the case in any further detail, or if 
you wish to have a copy of the opinion.  My telephone number is 011 44 207 
783 6582.  Many thanks.

Thor,

A quick note.  I don't believe I ever followed up with you on your weather 
business plan.  I looked at it several times primarily in pieces while 
traveling overseas.  I read it again today and wanted to give you some 
feedback.  I thought it was excellent work and very well presented.  Thank 
you for all your effort. 

 I am in town this week, I canceled being out of the office an additional 3 
days, and I will be spending time thinking about weather as well as some of 
our other businesses.  I'll give you a call toward the end of the week to 
discuss some of the ideas you presented. 

Mike

David:

As we discussed today, I am sending you this preliminary list of the Calme 
employees.  I will also fax a copy to your attention at the Drake Hotel.

We still have some work in progress on the allocations of certain people.

Upon your return we can begin to review the individuals on the list.

The enclosed list indicates the current proposed "New Roles" for each of the 
Calme employees.  As mentioned on the phone, we've allocated the employees 
among:  

Deploy immediately (however, certain individuals will have residual jobs to 
complete)
Transition Team (TT) to carry out the deployments and asset disposals
LNG/Middle East to go to EGM
Southern Cone (SC) (for Venezuela and Colombia businesses)
EES (which primarily include our development engineers and certain 
technical/operations people)

The table also indicates the Calme senior people (Resp Pty) assigned to 
ensure that no individual falls through the cracks.

The column "Calme" merely indicates our current internal sub-groupings, and 
you may wish to ignore it.

Please give me a call if you have any questions.

Shawn

Hi. I hope everything is going well at your end.

I would like to announce some good news. I have decided to get married at the 
year end on Saturday, 2nd December to be precise. 

The lucky or should it be foolhardy ladies name is Jaya. 

I would like to extend an invite to you and your family, a formal invite will 
follow in the post. 

I hope you are able to attend even if it means combining it with a business 
trip to this region. (December climate wise is the best time of year and the 
Taj Mahal is very romantic place and being one of the seven wonders of the 
world worth a visit).

Good wishes to your family.


Regards


Sunil

Forest Products Group

Enron Industrial Markets is at a key point in its development.  At the end of 
March, we expect to close the purchase of Daishowa's Quebec City newsprint 
mill.  When combined with Garden State, EIM is now the seventh largest 
newsprint producer in North America.  These two plants will be a crucial 
catalyst for the transformation of the paper industry towards a true 
commodity marketplace with a robust spot market, transparent pricing 
mechanisms, and increased liquidity.  As EIM begins this next stage of 
evolution in the pulp, paper and lumber markets, we have decided to rename 
our effort the "Forest Products Group".  We are also pleased to announce the 
following organizational changes in our commercial organization.  All of 
these individuals will report to the EIM Office of the Chairman.  These 
changes are effective immediately.

? Rodney Malcolm will assume responsibility for a new Sales and Marketing 
Group within the Forest Products Group.  The Sales and Marketing Group will 
be responsible for managing the sales of all physical products in which we 
make markets and the development of new markets for EIM in Asia and South 
America.  The Sales and Marketing Group is also responsible for growing EIM's 
sales activities in financial risk management products.  By combining 
physical and financial activities into one organization, we hope to 
accelerate the growth of our business and force the transformation of this 
industry.  The Sales and Marketing Group will be the primary relationship 
contact with our producer and consumer customer base.

? Rob Saltiel  will create a new Forest Products Origination Group.  The 
Forest Products Origination Group will focus on seeking value in longer term, 
highly structured transactions.  By setting up Origination as a stand-alone 
unit, we hope to increase the focus on higher value, long lead time 
opportunities.  Rob joins us from Enron in London where he has enjoyed 
tremendous origination success in the U.K. and European power sector.  Most 
recently, Rob has been with Enron Direct, Enron Europe's successful effort 
marketing energy to commercial customers.  Please join us in welcoming Rob to 
EIM.  Jay Boudreaux and Debbie Chance will be joining Rob's group.

? Bob Crane will continue to be responsible for trading and risk management 
in all Forest Product markets.

? Andy Kelemen will take the leadership of the Transaction Development 
Group.  Transaction Development will continue to provide deal execution 
resources and deal management support to all EIM activities.  Transaction 
Development will also handle all of EIM's corporate development and mergers 
and acquisitions activities.  Andy joins EIM from ENA where he led the 
Transaction Development Group for West Origination.  Prior to West 
Origination, Andy was with ENA Corporate Development.  He joined Enron from 
McKinsey in 1996.

Please join us in congratulating these individuals for their new roles.  This 
new organization will allow us to more keenly focus on our mission:  To be 
the premier market maker in physical products and financial risk management 
products in the Forest Products sector.

As most of you are aware, Brian Burnett has decided to accept a position in 
Enron Broadband Services.  Brian has been a key leader in building Enron's 
franchise in the pulp and paper markets and will be severely missed.  Please 
join us in wishing Brian well in his new endeavor.  Brian will continue to 
assist with transitional matters through the end of this quarter.

On Tuesday, March 13th at 4:00 pm we are hosting an EIM all employee meeting 
and happy hour at the Mercury Room.  Please plan to attend.  We will begin 
the meeting with a business review and will provide more details about the 
new Forest Products Group organization.

Subject: Garcia Munte / Update and exit strategy

As we are entering a new phase - hopefully the last one - in our business 
relationship with GM, it seems usefull to make an analysis of the situation 
today and the next steps; some changes in the teams, both sides, make this 
excercise even more necessary.

The goal since March 2000 has been to reduce our credit exposure to GM, 
taking into account that a too forceful action would have killed the company 
and transform our exposure into a straight loss.
We decided a specific course of action, splitting the unsecured exposure 
(product already delivered), from the financing of strategic inventories, 
without which GM cannot operate. 

For the first part(unsecured exposure), it couldnot be a straight downhill 
run, because the company needed regular supply to keep its customers, so we 
worked a -stair- plan bringing this exposure today to USD 14.5 million, with 
a 9.9 million payment October 31st and a last instalment of  4.6 million by 
end november.
We are not delivering any more product directly to GM but use ECTRIC Spain 
(ESSL), or pre-payment. The use of ESSL being not practical for the rack 
customer(bottom barrel retail customers), we insist on prepayment for those, 
and use ESSL for Kuwait Petroleum Corp and Continental, practically no credit 
risk customers. It must be kept in mind that this pre-payment policy ,may at 
one stage or another, dry up GM treasury to a point where they will not be 
able to repay fully the agreed instalments, especially the end october one.So 
it is a choice between getting the -old- debt repaid first, but give shorter 
terms of credit for new deliveries, say usd 3 million per 10 days period or 
so.  

For the second (strategic inventories), we estimated that the best strategy 
would be to have these inventories (93.000 mt : book value usd  20.6 million)
in a vehicle we have some control on. We decided on the already existing 
ESSL, however ESSL could not handle commercial operations without an 
operating licence in Spain, and we  got it in June, thanks to GM strong 
efforts. ESSL is 50/50 Joint Venture company in which each paid their share 
of Equity, however the 42.500 metric tons GM share inventories have been 
financed 100 pct by Enron,and Enron is "lending" its 42.500 MT to GM, on an 
industry accepted practice of buy/sale monthly contracts. In consequence, we 
asked GM to sign a Deed of Transfer of the whole to ESSL, which was done, but 
a discrepancy between seller legal entity (Garcia Munte Trading versus Garcia 
Munte Petroleos) and the advice from our Spanish lawyers to have this deed 
notarized, as well as having direct storage agreements with the terminal, has 
delayed sofar the completion of the legal paperwork.
We are now putting as a pre requisite before any new agreement to have this 
paper work signed.  The main reason to get this additional protection is to 
protect Enron interests in case of GM bankrupcy, as there is no clear legal 
opinion on the attitude a Spanish judge may have on such a complex case. 
It is necessary also to put into the equation that in case of GM bankrupcy, 
and in case a judge doesn't consider ESSL title solid enough, meaning we 
loose the control of the 93.000 metric tons  (or 42.500),  we have in the 
books a total hedge value of usd 6.6 million (difference between today's 
market value of usd  295 per metric ton versus original value of usd 225 per 
metric ton).

Position today : We had a meeting with GM in London october 23rd, our minutes 
of which is enclosed. We received from GM a long proposal for a new 
cooperation in Spanish that is being presently translated, at first sight it 
seems that this proposal doesn t match our own vision of the meeting. 
However, it seems the best strategy is still to avoid to despair GM to the 
point they will stop to repay,  and continue to battle for getting documents 
in good legal order. This is a narrow path, and all parties need to have a 
clear understanding of the parameters involved (hopefully explained above) 
before we go to the next meeting.
Thank you
Michel

Dear Mike,

Thank you for taking the time to meet with me this afternoon in spite of your 
busy schedule.  Your encouragement is appreciated, especially in light of the 
uncertainties resulting from the substantial shift in Enron's business 
paradigm.  I look forward to communicating with the individuals you 
suggested--in particular, Randy Maffett, Per Seska, Mark Tawney, and Eric 
Gonzales.

As you requested, attached below is my resume.

Best regards,
Manuel

I am working on the presentation for the analyst meetings that are taking 
place July 24-26.  Enron Net Works is being featured and as part of the 
overall story Skilling wants to see some basic information on your businesses 
(and a few other possible verticals and market places).  Please provide me 
with these 3 specific items of information.

1.  Total market size for your business:  e.g.  Pulp and Paper is approx. 
$300 billion.
2.  Your target market share of that total
3.  Targeted (or other comparable) margin that you would (or could) expect to 
see

I realize this is subjective but I do need an answer to all 3 questions.  Put 
any explanation that you feel is important or needed.  Also please quote the 
source of the global market size.  When I get all the information, I'll go 
through it with everyone.

We  also need to get the global size of the markets that we are considering 
moving into and if you know any of these below, please let me know.

Data storage
Grains
Petrochemicals
Steel
Logistics

Thank you for your quick response.

Mike

Subject: FOR IMMEDIATE REVIEW: Agreement Restricting Power Generation 
Competition in Asia Pacific Region

General Counsels -

At the direction of the Enron APACHI Office of the Chairman, I am sending 
this e-mail to you pursuant to the Enron Corp. Policy on Noncompetition.  I 
would appreciate if you would check with your CEO/COO regarding this e-mail 
and respond to me by Friday, September 29 if you have questions or concerns.  
Enron APACHI may need to commit to the following provisions (that bind Enron 
affiliates) by Monday, October 2.

Given the consolidating power generation market in Asia Pacific, Enron Asia 
Pacific/Africa/China (Enron APACHI) is proposing to enter into a transaction 
with Marubeni and Sithe Asia to combine the respective power generation 
portfolios into a single company (Newco).  Newco would be charged with making 
the shareholders' investments as liquid as possible to allow for sale of the 
shareholders' respective stakes in Newco.  

The shareholders believe that Newco must not be seen by the market as a 
"dumping ground" for existing power projects but rather as the vehicle 
through which the investors will continue to pursue power generation 
opportunities in Asia.  As a result, Enron APACHI proposes to include 
competition restrictions in the Marubeni/Enron Shareholder Agreement that 
would bind their respective affiliates.  

The following is a summary of these competition provisions:

Enron affiliates (with the exceptions stated below) could only develop or own 
power projects in the Asia Pacific Region (as defined below) after first 
offering the opportunity to Newco.  If Newco declines the opportunity, Enron 
would be free to own the project itself or offer the project to third parties 
provided that the terms do not materially improve.  Development or ownership 
does not include the provision of construction, O&M, offtaker or risk 
management services.

There are a number of exceptions to this rule:  (a) small projects involving 
20 MW or less; (b) projects in which Enron owns less than a 1/3 interest; (c) 
projects initiated by our SK joint venture; (d) Korean projects using natural 
gas produced by Enron; (e) projects obtained in a corporate acquisition in 
which Asia generation is less than 20% of the value of the acquisition; and 
(f) situations in which any Enron company would be exposed to fiduciary 
liability to another shareholder in complying with the competition 
restriction.

"Affiliates" will be defined to exclude Enron affiliates which are 
publicly-owned (e.g., Azurix).

"Asia Pacific Region" will be defined to include Brunei, China (including 
Hong Kong and Macau), South Korea, North Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Laos, 
Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, East 
Timor, Singapore, Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Islands (including Guam, 
Saipan, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Fiji, but excluding Hawaii).  
It does not include Japan and Australia.

The competition clause would survive until the earlier of (a) Enron selling 
its interest in Newco or (b) December 31, 2003.

Thank you,
Bruce Lundstrom, General Counsel, Enron APACHI

Richard,
 Hello from South America.  I am forwarding this email from John regarding 
the J-Block problems.  Have you been involved in this?  What are your 
thoughts?  If you have any ideas or can provide with some help, please 
follow-up.  This is confidential but i thought you could help.  When he 
mentioned this, I really couldn't remember much.  Amazing how the memory 
fades on some of the details in just a few years.

Crilly/LON/ECT@ECT 
Subject: J-Block


I mentioned on our conference call on Monday that J-Block has had problems 
meeting our nominations from the Judy/Joanne/Janice reservoirs.

Up until recent CATS maintenance shutdown on 15 May, they were making up for 
reduced production volumes by nominating to supply gas at the NBP which they 
are entitled but not obliged to do.  Since return from outage at the end of 
May they have declined to nominate at the NBP.  

>From 1 January to 15 May, the Sellers use of the NBP delivery option kept 
underdeliveries to 350 mmcf (ie one day's maximum quantity) in total.  Since 
returning from the maintenance shutdown, underdeliveries have totalled 850 
mmcf ( averaging 77mcf/d ).

We believe that following the sharp rise in market prices during the 
maintenance period, they have decided to default on the contract rather than 
make up deliveries from other sources.   They have an effective cap on the 
penalties of about 5 pence per therm (after taking into account the value of 
the liquids) and therefore they are not making up the volumes when the daily 
price is substantially higher than about 16 pence per therm.

Prior to the CATS shutdown, we had made them a proposal to enable them to 
deliver additional volumes at  another alternative to avoid default but they 
have not responded yet.

You mentioned that in your negotiations with Phillips they had committed to 
getting us all the gas regardless of the cap on the penalties.  This has cost 
us about $1.5 million to date and they seem to be institutionalising their 
non performance.    Perhaps a phone call by you might help.  

By the way I will be in Houston on Thursday and Friday to meet with the 
delegation from Croatia and I will probably be tied up the entire time but if 
you need me
for a phone call I can break away.

John

John, 

This just got sent and it appears you were left of the cc list.  We will be 
discussing with your guys this week to determine the best way forward.  
Everyone is under earnings pressure and it is asking too much for someone to 
dedicate 10-20% of their time on a product.  The intent of this email is not 
to take people but to add people to the offices, if necessary, to make sure 
they live, eat and drink weather.

We can discuss when I'm in later this week.

As Mike and I look across all of our business units, we continue to look for 
optimal organizational structures that will enable each business unit to 
achieve it's targets for  2001 and beyond.  In our weather business, there 
appears to be a lack of seamlessness.  Reporting relationships, P&L, and 
vision for this business are not best aligned as this business exists today.  

Mike and I would like to address this as follows:    we need 100% full time 
dedication from each and any employee that is dedicated to the weather 
business.  All identified employees in the weather business will now become 
full time employees of EGM and report to Mark Tawney. Accordingly Mark and I 
will be looking at, with each of you, the employees that may be affected by 
this transition and the need to hire additional employees.  It is important 
that both business units work together to determine which individuals will be 
in Weather, or  will be in EEL.  Once done, Mark will begin adding to the 
weather team in each of your regions.   It is obvious that the organizations 
and product lines can lever each other and the synergy's will provide 
powerful results in our regional gas and power businesses in particular.  

If you look at coal, lng, equities, etc, we have employees based in each of 
your regions who report back into the appropriate business unit within EGM.  
This restructure will similarly align weather.  

Please give me a call and we will discuss the issues surrounding this new 
structure.

Thanks for the response.

I found a beautiful Bonnard in London and NY.  I will be buying in next day 
or two.  Asking price is $9,500.  I will keep the Lautrecs in mind.  I think 
one is in my future - next.  I don't think I'll be buying one for a few 
months.

I'll get back to you.

I see that we are scheduled to have lunch today.   I may have to postpone 
again, I'll let you know later this morning.  I am out all weekend and we 
have to have the final comments on the Analyst Presentation in by sunday 
night so I may be working over lunch.  Actually, I think we are in pretty 
good shape so I will probably be doing lunch but just don't be too mad if I 
have to cancel.

PS  Your brother told me he went to 3 bowl games (when I found out that two 
of them were the galleryfurniture.com bowl and that one in Shreveport (I

 How does one make contributions to JDF when stationed overseas?  I am here 
in Tokyo with EnCom and participated in the walks before moving overseas.  
Kathy Knott is an old high school friend and got me interested in JDF some 
years ago.

Subject: Juvenile Diabetes Foundation Fundraising

It is my sincere honor to once again lead the Enron team in this year's 
Juvenile Diabetes Foundation (JDF) walk scheduled to take place on Sunday, 
November 5, 2000, at the Sam Houston Race Park.  I continue to serve on the 
board of JDF representing Enron and will be Enron's corporate executive for 
this year's fundraising efforts.

As many of you may already know, I am an insulin dependent diabetic myself.  
Even though I know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the 
multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day, I cannot 
imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease.  Taking 
insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of 
complications; insulin is simply their life support system and without it 
they would die.

Enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for JDF again this year.  JDF 
is a very efficient organization in which approximately 84% of all money 
raised goes directly to research.  Enron's goal this year is to raise 
$225,000 and we need your help.  Enron has been the number 1 walk team for 5 
years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place!  We need team 
leaders, walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal.  The theme for the 
walk this year is "Knock Out Diabetes" and we would like to have you join us 
for this great event.  The Walk is truly a blast and we had about 500 Enron 
people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it.

If you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader, or if 
you would like to make a pledge, you may call any of the steering committee 
members listed below.  If you are interested in being a team leader, please 
contact one of the following people immediately so that you may be included 
in the first important and informative training session taking place this 
week.

Thank you very much for your support.

Chris,

Thanks for the email.  I'll wait to get the pictures it will definitely 
help.  I miss understood about the photos, I thought you were sending me via 
email that next day.   Congrats on the Cassatt, that person will really enjoy 
it.  

Let me know about the price as soon as you get a chance.  I understand that 
there is a shipping component and no sales tax.  I like to have all my art 
shipped because the tax savings can be significant, especially in New York.  
I did like that frame on the picture but didn't understand your comment below 
($783).  The price you had did include the frame didn't it?

Thanks,
Mike

Dear Mike:
Thanks for the email.  I sent a package via US mail with photos of each
piece to you on Wednesday night.  (The Cassatt was sold already, sorry.)  I
thought you would want to look at the pieces with your wife, and make the
decision together.

We do not accept credit cards, but checks are fine.  I will speak ot Mr.
Hubert about the price, however are you interested in the frame?  Also be
aware the crating charge for this piece is $150., but no sales tax. ($783.)

Please wait for the images if you like, and we will speak soon.

Best Wishes,

Chris

Lea,

I like this and it gives us something to start with.

Let's us this as a "living" document and expand it with the thought that we 
can present this to Ken as a presentation.

A few thoughts:
Add a section of what the collection will not be. e.g.:  not so contemporary 
that majority of people will have a very negative reaction.  Understanding 
that not everyone will ever agree on everything
Address a few ideas on key locations and options per key areas.  For 
example:  5 key large major areas could contain the following themes - 1 
large painting by commissioned contemporary recognized artists.  Present a 
few artists as options and ideas.  Key trading areas:  could be modern and 
high energy to reflect the culture or the opposite, more serene commentary as 
a balance.  pick artists as an idea.
Address key themes:  trading are will have xxxx, individual business unit 
common areas can be distinct to their culture with guidelines such as xxxx.  
Describe the area reserved for Enron  memorabilia?
General theme considerations and guidelines: Innovation, global, as you've 
already addressed
List out options with front entry area (Nevelson)
Address old building and what we are going to do with the collection:  for 
example art work will be more consistent within business units and will be 
re-aligned, common areas will link with new concepts and themes
A few thoughts on budget and generally how it will be spent as a guideline:  
e.g.:  20% will be spent on 5 key areas, 10% on trading floor areas.....
Timeline and the need to start now
Update:  RC set up and ready, funding by Andy Fastow

I hope this helps and gives you feedback as you wanted.  With Jeff and my new 
responsibilities, we have even less time to spend on this then before.  We 
should discuss and address now so that it is fair on you and we put that plan 
tougher as well.

Thanks,
Mike

PS:  I'm sorry but I forgot to address the sponsorship idea you had.  If you 
still feel strongly about it send me an email and I'll run it through the 
channels.

Guys,

Attached is a resume for a guy I know via technology and a very old parental 
friendship.  He is a very aggressive guy and marketer type.  He has the 
personality to be an originator or mid-marketer.  He would pound the phones.

Follow up if you want to talk with him.

I am going to forward on to technology guys too but wanted to give you first 
crack.

Mike

Subject: Origination Opportunities in Global Markets


Hello Mike,

It has been a while since my last communication with you. I hope all is well.

I want you to know that I greatly appreciated you helping me get in touch 
with Ken Rice and all of the other folks at EBS last year. We made great 
strides and came very close to doing a deal between our organizations. 
However, Comdisco recently has come under some financial duress and is most 
likely going to be sold off in pieces.

I have been talking with some of the folks within EBS about the possibility 
of an origination position with their group. However, I am of the opinion 
that EBS is slightly ahead of the market, and therefore the timing may not be 
right for me to consider an origination position with EBS.

With that being said, I would be very interested in exploring what 
opportunities might exist within your Global Markets group from an 
origination standpoint. As you know, I am professionally aggressive, mentally 
tough and fearless of contacting potential clients. I have solid experience 
in professional selling, possess excellent communication and entrepreneurial 
skills.

Mike please consider the attached resume below. I would welcome the 
opportunity to meet with you or the appropriate person within your 
organization at any time.

Thanks again, and I hope to hear from you.

Richard Dukes

Subject: Dolphin Q&As  

Rick,

Consistent with our discussions and the information you provided, I intend to 
use the following additional statements if needed to respond to media 
inquiries.  Your comments and approval would be appreciated.

Q.  Can you confirm that the contract will be signed in March?

A.  We expect that a "Heads of Agreement" between the governments of Qatar 
and the UAE will be signed.  This is a very significant agreement outlining 
commercial terms for the development of Qatari gas for export to the UAE.  
With this government-to-government protocol, the project developers (UAE 
Offsets Group, TotalFinaElf and Enron) can now proceed with negotiations over 
other key elements such as the Production Sharing Agreement, GSA and 
transmission access agreements.   It will be a number of months before these 
other agreements can be completed and sufficient detail is available for the 
Dolphin project developers to agree to and secure necessary approvals.

Q.  What are the details of the agreement with Qatar?

A.  The UAE Offsets Group as majority owner is the appropriate authority for 
comment on such an agreement.  In addition, as the project progresses, 
TotalFinaElf is expected to play a major role in the upstream development.  
Enron expects to focus its attention on gas marketing, pipeline development, 
project structuring/financing and risk management.

Q.  What will be Enron's financial commitment to the project?  

A.  It would not be appropriate to discuss specific cost figures at this 
stage.  However, I can say that we expect to project finance most of Enron 
and the other company's participation in Dolphin.  In addition, the Dolphin 
Strategic Partners have structured the project to provide for multiple 
investors, who will be offered the opportunity to join the venture after key 
project documents are executed.  


Q.  Offsets has often described Dolphin as a $10 billion project.  Is this 
true?

A.  It would not be appropriate to discuss project costs at this time.  
However, it is clear that the cost for the initial phases of the project 
(production and delivery of 2 to 3 bcfd of gas from Qatar to the UAE) is 
nowhere near this amount.  The $10 billion number assumes later expansions of 
the project to supply Oman, Pakistan and possibly India, plus an investment 
multiplier effect to reflect the potential new downstream facilities that end 
users will be able to build once Dolphin gas is available to fuel such new 
facilities

Thanks Jeff. 

Mike/Jeff:  FYI---all of our people are out of Gaza except four egyptians 
that are safe in Gaza city( a quiet area because no Israelis will enter).  We 
are working on a plan to get the egyptians safely back to egypt, but now is 
not the time for them to move.  ABB has pulled its people out so construction 
is stalled.  I saw some dramatic pictures on CNN here showing an Israeli 
helicopter hovering over our plant, shooting rockets into the Netzarim 
junction about a quarter mile away.

Andrew will be in London on Monday to initiate discussions with British Gas.  
I will follow up with Andrew/BG after he lays the groundwork.

Rick

Subject: Latest developments in Palestine

All borders to Gaza have now been completely closed for both Palestinians and 
foreigners, including a shutdown of the Gaza airport.  The Palestinians 
rejected the Israeli ultimatum, and an escalation of the conflict is widely 
expected to begin on Monday night.  

I have spoken with some Americans and British friends who had stayed in Gaza, 
and they  reported that their embassy's have called them, and warned them of 
a possible escalation following the expiration of Baraks 48 hour ultimatum.  
There is little that the embassy's have been able to do to help the people 
still in Gaza due to the political sensitivites and lack of cooperation 
between them and the IDF, but we should take note of their response, as 
confirmation that we cannot rely on their assistance in the future for 
evacuations.  When Jim Roundtree and I visisted the head of security at the 
US embassy, he warned that an evacuation of Gaza by the US embassy is very 
unlikely under any circumstances because of the difficulty of coordinating 
such an excercise with the US military, and the "political message" it would 
send.  

Regards,

Jeff

Subject: Spain Update 13/11/2000

We've just returned from 3 days full of meetings in Barcelona which has 
resulted in the following agreements being reached and executed:

- Transfer of product stored in Spain in the name of ECTRIC Spain (JV company 
with GM) ensuring that the product has been transferred from the correct GM 
entity and that ECTRIC Spain has contractual rights with the Storage 
Terminals currently holding the Product. 
This has more thoroughly protected Enron's exposure to GM for about $20MM, 
along with the various hedges we've entered into.

- C. Mahoney is now MD of ECTRIC Spain; resulting in Enron not having to 
obtain any authorisation from GM for ECTRIC Spain - Enron have sole authority 
( to move funds etc.).

- A Framework Collaboration agreement for future business with GM for ECTRIC 
Spain's activities, which revolves around a joint committee making all 
decisions with regard to who ECTRIC Spain supplies/delivers to, and what 
payment/credit terms should be granted.

- We have committed to keeping the stock in Spain until end June 2001, at 
which time we can liquidate 50% of it, and the other 50% to be gradually 
bought out by GM before Dec2001 or will be liquidated by us.

- We have their undertaking not to further increase GM indebtedness without 
Enron's approval

- we have re-scheduled the existing debt (about $10mm), repayable before end 
Dec 2000. Any default in this payment schedule will result in the 
Collaboration Agreement falling away and ECTRIC Spain will no longer be bound 
to maintaining the Strategic Stock. 

- During last week we received a payment of $5mm from GM (this reduced the 
debt from $15 to $10)

Issues/ action items which will require urgent / immediate attention:-

1) Appointments of the joint working committee  - Enron (Chris Mahoney / Adam 
Nye) to be formally notified. GM (?)
2) Storage Agreements with the terminals to be documented in the name of 
ECTRIC Spain.
3) Contacts and working relationships to be made at the Storage Terminals by 
Enron Staff ( Graham Cane & Adam Nye)
4) Third Parties / Operators Contracts currently in the name of GM as 
Supplier to be replaced by ECTRIC Spain - contractual terms including Credit 
and Payment terms to be reviewed/ by Enron  Legal, Trading, Logistics & 
Credit and advise the Enron representatives on the working committee 
accordingly.
5) Future Supplies to GM from ECTRIC Spain - contract to be documented 
including prepayment terms

This is the strongest position we have held in the last 8 months and has 
taken this long to negotiate. Though not yet completely secure, we have 
definitely made a leap in the right direction.

Opps to hedge international exposures locally.



       =DJ Asia Debt:Pricing In Tokyo Credit Derivs Mkt A Bit Askew

Dow Jones International News Service via Dow Jones



  By Brian Fowler


  A Dow Jones Newswires Column


  TOKYO (Dow Jones)--Pricing levels in Tokyo's credit derivatives market
show  it's cheaper to buy protection on some top-rated Japanese issuers
these days  than on U.S. names with similar ratings, a clear sign that
record-high  bankruptcies and bad debts in the banking system aren't
shaking the market's  faith in this nation's top companies.

  Take, for example, Ford Motor Co. (F) and Honda Motor Co. (HMC or 7267).
Both  have solid A2 credit ratings from Moody's Investors Service. And yet,
as of last  week, the cost of credit default protection on five-year Honda
U.S.  dollar-denominated debt stood around 30 basis points, while
protection on  five-year debt issued by Ford Motor Credit, Ford's financing
arm, was around 70  basis points.

  Bankers and institutional investors use the credit derivatives market
either  to shed risk on loans and bonds or to take on risk as an
investment. In a credit  default swap, the most commonly-used credit
derivative, one party pays a fee  measured in basis points on a notional
value. The recipient of the fee - the  risk-taker - is considered the
investor.

  In the case of Honda Motor, Japanese banks looking to reduce the exposure
in  their portfolios to that company's debt would benefit from the
relatively low  cost of doing so. But hedge funds, non-life insurers and
other investors seeking  exposure to Honda as a way of picking up revenue
would get stuck with lower  returns.

  "One of Honda's main markets is the U.S. market, so if an investor wants
exposure to the U.S. auto market, Ford offers better spreads," said Joseph
Slankas, assistant vice president in the Global Credit Derivatives division
at  Merrill Lynch in Tokyo.

  The pricing distortions in Tokyo's credit derivatives market can be
linked to  two main factors: the low interest rate environment here and
skewed  supply-demand dynamics.

  "In the last two years, markets have swung from a focus on hedging to
being  totally dominated by investors," said Malcolm Perry, managing
director at J.P.  Morgan Securities Asia Pet. Limited in Tokyo.

  Not surprisingly, heavy demand to sell protection reduces the premium on
that  service.

  More than anything else, however, the narrow spreads in Japan's credit
derivatives market underscore the relatively underdeveloped state of the
nation's corporate bond market and the effect this has on liquidity.
  For decades, Japanese companies have tended to rely heavily on bank
financing  rather than directly tapping capital markets. As a result, while
Japan's  government bond market is as big or bigger than the Treasurys
market, the  corporate bond market here remains relatively small.

  The value of outstanding Japanese corporate bonds was around Y50 trillion
at  the end of February, according to the Japan Securities Dealers
Association.  That's less than one-eighth the size of the U.S. market,
where the value of  outstanding issues stood at $3.372 trillion at the end
of December, according to  the U.S. Bond Market Association.

  A small market means a dearth of liquidity, which inhibits trading in
secondary markets.

  On top of that, the lack of an indigenous Japanese high-yield market -
all of  Japan's high-yield issuers are so-called fallen angels - leaves
investors with  few opportunities to diversify their portfolios. As a
result, the bulk of  trading in Tokyo's credit derivatives market involves
names rated A or higher.
  To be sure, there are also historical factors that tilt the supply-demand
balance. Despite the bad-loan crisis here, many Japanese bankers feel that
domestic top-rated companies are still a relatively safe bet in the
international marketplace.

  "Even if ratings are the same, we tend to feel that the real distance a
corporation has to fall to default is larger here," said Takashi Miyauchi,
manager of the Derivative Products Division at Fuji Bank Ltd.
  It's not hard to see why. The U.S. corporate landscape has been scorched
recently by the likes of companies such as Xerox Corp. (XRX) and Lucent
Technologies (LU), both of which have struggled over the past year with
heavy  debt loads and credit rating downgrades after having been considered
solid  credits going into the year 2000.

  Moody's cut its domestic currency rating for Xerox to Baa2 in September
2000,  three notches below where the rating had been at the end of 1999.
Lucent's fall  was even steeper - to Baa3 in February, four notches below
where it was in  October 2000.

  In contrast, credit derivatives players in Tokyo say they can't recall a
major  credit event on a traded Japanese name since late 1998, when
Long-Term Credit  Bank and Nippon Credit Bank collapsed in quick
succession.
  The sense of relative safety regarding top-rated Japanese names is a key
factor in the dearth of tiering - or spread - between different grades of
double  A credits, according to Kazuyasu Makabe, vice president, credit
trading at J.P.  Morgan Securities Asia.

  "Toyota Corp., with tremendous fundamentals, is rated AA1 and trades with
a  credit default swap rate around 15 basis points in yen. Sony, another
great  company, is two notches lower at AA3 and yet only trades about two
basis points  over Toyota," Makabe said.

  In the U.S. you might expect the lower-rated credit to trade at a spread
of 10  basis points or more over the higher-rated company, Makabe said.
  The upshot of this is that low spreads can squeeze some investors out of
the  market for Japanese names.

  "We are focusing on U.S. and euro names because spreads on Japanese names
are  so tight," said Koji Ogawa, assistant manager of the Investment and
Structured  Finance Group at the Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance  Co.
  Pricing is an increasing concern for casualty insurers like Tokio Marine
and  Fire because the effects of deregulation have hit profitability in
core  operations while sluggish stock prices and rock-bottom interest rates
have  weighed on investment returns.

  "The core businesses for non-life companies are becoming less profitable,
so  it's important for them to diversify earnings sources," said Ayako
Nakajima,  non-life insurer analyst at Standard & Poor's in Tokyo.

Subject: Juvenile Diabetes Foundation Fundraising

It is my sincere honor to once again lead the Enron team in this year's 
Juvenile Diabetes Foundation (JDF) walk scheduled to take place on Sunday, 
November 5, 2000, at the Sam Houston Race Park.  I continue to serve on the 
board of JDF representing Enron and will be Enron's corporate executive for 
this year's fundraising efforts.

As many of you may already know, I am an insulin dependent diabetic myself.  
Even though I know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the 
multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day, I cannot 
imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease.  Taking 
insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of 
complications; insulin is simply their life support system and without it 
they would die.

Enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for JDF again this year.  JDF 
is a very efficient organization in which approximately 84% of all money 
raised goes directly to research.  Enron's goal this year is to raise 
$225,000 and we need your help.  Enron has been the number 1 walk team for 5 
years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place!  We need team 
leaders, walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal.  The theme for the 
walk this year is "Knock Out Diabetes" and we would like to have you join us 
for this great event.  The Walk is truly a blast and we had about 500 Enron 
people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it.

If you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader, or if 
you would like to make a pledge, you may call any of the steering committee 
members listed below.  If you are interested in being a team leader, please 
contact one of the following people immediately so that you may be included 
in the first important and informative training session taking place this 
week.

Thank you very much for your support.

RAC came by and brought up a couple of concerns.  1- the Var on this deal is 
over $120m (more than all of ENE combined); they wanted to make me aware of 
the size, and they know we are working on it. and 2 - EE&CC; they were 
concerned about them doing the deal and their abilities and effects on MTM 
treatment.  I told them that they can bid on it but we want others to bid and 
that we probably won't use them.  They stated that the deal guys are acting 
like EE&CC is a done deal.

Lets discuss.
Thanks,
mike

Mike,
I just had my schedule changed dramatically for tomorrow and will not be able 
to talk.  How about Friday @ 10am?
Sorry, but we have a situation I must get involved with and change a 
direction.

I did review the email, and passed it on to others.  I do not see much from 
this site nor how it is actually going to develop real liquidity in the 
market.  If there are a couple of items that you want me to specifically be 
ready for , please send me a couple of comments via email or voicemail.

Thanks,
Mike

FYI. As part of our business plan to manage the power price risk for the 
contingent call option book we purchased the following options from the desk 
yesterday. It was not the most cost effective way to hedge ($40 for a $200 
call with underlying around $100), but it keeps us on track executing the 
business plan. As the portfolio becomes larger and we move to using swaps as 
well as options to hedge, we'll be better positioned to minimize our hedging 
costs.

We had a good meeting with Berkshire this morning on the reinsurance piece of 
the book. I'll have a syndication report prepared for you with status on 
Friday.

Daily) - 20 MW for upfront premium of $ 40 per MWhr

I glanced at it and it appears fine from my perspective.  Others should make

ditto. Even before we had signed the contract, you all took over the 
integration and gave me every confidence that you would get the job done.  
Thanks for all your continued help.  We are going to need all of your input 
as we begin to develop deal entry, scheduling and dispatch systems.

I wanted to take a minute to commend all of you on a job well done in 
successfully integrating WebModal and implementing the operational processes 
for Freight Markets in a very short period of time.  I have been involved in 
several acquisitions over the years here at Enron and I have never seen one 
that went as well as WebModal from an operational standpoint.  Everyone came 
together as a team and ensured that integration timelines were met and that 
the business was allowed to continue its daily operations with minimal 
problems internally or to our external counterparties.

Again, congratulations on a great job.  Thanks for all of your hard work.

Brent

As discussed - the First Gas article.  Also, I talked to Jeff & George about 
Sempra/SCEG and both said it was completely executed.  We are booking the

John, didn't see you copied on this but this basically shuts us out.  This is 
going to be worse than what we had already forecasted at 250mb/month.  
Essentially, what I take from this message is that they are agreeing to cut 
the highest cost power out ( which is the Santa Rita power plant) and it is 
only going to run @ 3mbd or less.   So instead of 250mb month that I had told 
Scott Earnest it will now only be more like 100mb.

Subject: FGPC 2001 Fuel Consumption

Scott, John,
     See article below dated December 15-16, 2000 from Manila, Philippines 
and pay particular attention to paragraphs 6, 7 and 9.   As you can see, 
Meralco (the power purchaser from FGPC) and the National Power Corporation 
(Napocor) have agreed to a minimal dispatch of the FGPC Sta. Rita power plant 
until December 26, 2001.  This would place the liquid fuel deliveries for the 
upcoming year at about 10% or less of the originally anticipated 31kbd, so 
this should certainly be addressed in our 2001 budget.
Regards,
Mike

Subject: News Article - Ano Ba Yan!!!



				MANILA, PHILIPPINES | Friday-Saturday, December 15-16, 2000 
				Meralco settles access dispute with Napocor
				With a new agreement signed Tuesday night, power distribution firm Manila 
Electric Company (Meralco) and state-owned National Power Corporation 
(Napocor) finally settled their dispute over alleged violations on "open 
access transmission." 
				As a result, Meralco paid Napocor 684 million Philippine pesos ($13.661 
million at PhP50.071=$1), representing its unpaid electricity bills for the 
June 26 to July 25 billing period. 
				Meralco's bills actually amounted to PhP5.3 billion ($105.85 million), but it 
paid only PhP4.6 billion ($91.87 million), claiming it incurred unnecessary 
losses when the state utility failed to allow the output of its independent 
power producer (IPPs) to come on stream. Meralco claimed Napocor should 
absorb these losses. 
				Meralco paid about PhP20 million ($399,433) in accrued interests as Napocor, 
for its part, claimed it failed to meet its own obligations because of 
Meralco's non-payment. 
				In an interview with BusinessWorld, Napocor treasurer Laura F. Salandanan 
said Meralco's payment eased the pressure on Napocor's very tight cash flows 
as December always mean bigger debt servicing. 
				Under the letter of agreement signed by Napocor president Federico E. Puno 
and Meralco executive vice-president and chief operating officer Jesus P. 
Francisco, the full capacity of Meralco's IPP, particularly the 440-megawatt 
(MW) Mauban coal-fired power plant operated by the Quezon Power (Phils.), 
Ltd., will be able to come on stream. 
				On the other hand, minimal dispatch will be used for the 1,000-MW Sta. Rosa 
combined cycle power plant operated by First Gas Power Corp. 
				In a separate interview, Napocor's department manager of utility economics 
Jesusito Sulit said the two parties agreed to such a compromise since energy 
from the Sta. Rita plant is higher because it uses condensate fuel in the 
absence of the natural gas. Electricity produced from coal-fired power 
plants, on the other hand, is less expensive. 
				Since the natural gas that will be fed to the Sta. Rita plant will come only 
by January 2002, the agreement will be implemented retroactive to October 26, 
2000 to December 26, 2001. 
				Mr. Sulit said Napocor will replace the Sta. Rita output by providing Meralco 
with less expensive power and, at the same time, offer a discount rate of as 
much as PhP1.16 per kilowatt hour (kWh). 
				This discount, Mr. Sulit said, will mean savings for Meralco because it no 
longer needs to pay for the fuel requirements of Sta. Rita plant. Under the 
power purchase deal between the two firms, Meralco spends for fuel used by 
the plant. 
				First Gas, for its part, will still receive payments despite the unutilized 
capacity of its plants because of the presence of the take-or-pay agreement. 
				For Napocor, it will be assured of a captured market and consequently 
additional revenues in terms of higher energy sales. 
				Mr. Sulit said consumers are also expected to benefit not necessarily from a 
much lower power rates but from an assurance that electricity bills will not 
increase as much.

Paul,

FYI, you were invited to our off-site because we felt that our businesses 
were so linked together and that we could all get on the same page with 
regard to updates, vision and relationship building.  We also invited Joe and 
Thor as the only other non-EGM people.  If you can make it would be great but 
we do know how difficult it is to make it over.  I did hear your California 
request and it could happen.  We haven't found the right place yet.  
California is experiencing serious blackouts and it could be difficult.  
We'll be in touch.

Cheers,
mike

Jim,

Thank you so much for all your help on this matter.  I know how difficult 
your job is day to day without items like this popping up.  I spoke with 
Carol Randall and Cindy Levi, the principal of the school, and they are so 
appreciative it is hard to describe it.  The school constantly talks about 
Enron and hundreds of children are using the donated computers and now 
printers.

Thanks again and have a good holiday.
