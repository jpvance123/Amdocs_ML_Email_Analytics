Subject: LNG - Europe

Eric, 

I recieved a call from a guy with Pacific Interlink (?).  He is looking to 
market LNG in Europe.  Since I have very little knowledge in this area, I 
didn't get much specific information.  But, I told him I would find someone 
for him to talk with.  His name is Sam Kovacevich.  Phone:  847-971-3369.  I 
would appreciate it if you would give Sam a call.  If you aren't the person 
he needs to talk to, please let me know.  Thanks.

Congratulations!  For an unprecedented five years in a row, Enron has been 
ranked the "Most Innovative Company in America" by Fortune magazine.  In 
addition, for the first time, Enron has also been ranked #1 in "Quality of 
Management," topping General Electric and Omnicom Group, and our "Employee 
Talent" has been ranked #2, behind Goldman Sachs and ahead of Cisco 
Systems.   America's most admired management team is paired with the best and 
brightest employee talent.  That winning combination has led to Enron's 
five-year "Most Innovative" sweep.  The "Most Admired" list will appear in 
Fortune's Feb. 21 issue, available on newsstands Feb. 8.

You are the reason we have achieved such consistent recognition.  You bring 
the innovative ideas to Enron and create new business opportunities.  You 
contribute to our quality management team.  And you are the outstanding 
employee talent that makes Enron such an exciting and successful company.

Keep up your outstanding work, and we look forward to even greater 
achievements in 2000!

I spoke to Mr. Maldinado this morning and it doesn't look good.  He claims he 
has a connection to the Minister of "Energy" who will allocate gas to him.  I 
asked where would the gas be delivered, and he said anywhere you want it.  
Short term or long term?  Again, anything you want, but probably long term is 
better.

I pointed out that there isn't an Energy Minister in Saudi and would he know 
the name of the Minister whose giving him the gas?  He stumbled and couldn't 
remember the name.

Finally he said "What do you have to lose?  Just send me a letter requesting 
gas with the specs, location and duration" and he'll do his best to get it.  

If you want to try it Rob, he's all yours.  His fax number is 562/866-7368, 
address 16276 Grand Avenue, Bellflower, CA 90706.

Samir

Rob, 

I got your name from Doug Leach.  He  thought that you would be the person to 
talk to about this.

I got a call last night from Rudolph Maldonado.  (The operator forwarded him 
our way.)  He stated that he has some natural gas to sell in Saudi Arabia.  
His number is 562-866-1755.  Could you give him a call and check this out?  I 
told him that I would find someone that he could discuss this with.

I can be reached at 3-6905 if you have any questions.

Daren Farmer

We will soon be migrating to Windows 2000 and Outlook.  The Texas Desk is scheduled for Tuesday, April 10th.  I was told to pass along the following information to my group:

1.  You will be receiving emails from the migration team ("GEM") - please be sure to only open this from your own desktop, and not remotely.  This is very important.  These messages will be explaining the migration process and what you need to do to insure a successful migration.

2.  Due to new space limitations on your mailbox, you are advised to clean your Notes mailbox of old, unneeded messages BEFORE migration.  With Outlook, you will be restricted to a Mailbox size of 100 MB.  Outlook will issue a warning once you reach 75 MB to let you know that you are near your Mailbox Limit.  Once you reach 100 MB, you will be prevented from sending email, but you will still be able to receive internal and external messages  You will then need to reduce the size of your mailbox by deleting old mail, saving attachments to a local drive, etc. before you will be able to send an email again.

3.  From the day of migration, only 30 days of old mail will be migrated from your mailbox.  This includes mail in your inbox and other folders.  Calendar items dating back one year from the day of migration will be migrated.

4.  Everyone will have a read only view of Notes until the transition is completed.  You will be able to copy/paste.

Thanks,
Laura

The accomplishments by 6/19 is for Directors and above - to Sally.  
Individual groups under Sally will probably set their deadlines PRIOR to the 
smaller PRC's.    That is correct.
I did not understand that Promotions are to be discussed prior to the meeting 
with Sally  Our notes indicate that Sally wanted some prior discussions on 
this subject.   nor did I understand that the employee had to be in their 
role for 1 year.  Our notes indicate that this would be the general rule of 
thumb.  I thought the Promotion discussion would be an agenda item of PRC.  
We believe that discussion of promotions will also occur at the PRC.   
Additionally, I understood the Mid-Year promotion listing would not be as 
extensive as year-end, maintaining the year-end as the primary promotion 
time. We understood the same.

Subject: Re: PRC Meeting Agenda Recap  

I think I'm unclear on some points.  

The accomplishments by 6/19 is for Directors and above - to Sally.  
Individual groups under Sally will probably set their deadlines PRIOR to the 
smaller PRC's.
I did not understand that Promotions are to be discussed prior to the meeting 
with Sally nor did I understand that the employee had to be in their role for 
1 year.    I thought the Promotion discussion would be an agenda item of 
PRC.  Additionally, I understood the Mid-Year promotion listing would not be 
as extensive as year-end, maintaining the year-end as the primary promotion 
time.
 Can you clarify?  Thanks.

Please see the following instructions for the new messenging board.  If you 
have any trouble entering into this site, please let me know.  Everyone 
should now be setup and ready to go. You will have to add this site to one of 
your favorites.  

The Gas Message Board application can run on both IE5.0 and IE5.5 now. 

Attached is the URL for user to run the application.

http://gasmsgboard.dev.corp.enron.com

Please feel free to forward above URL to people who like to test the 
application. 

Here is the steps they should do:

1) Launch Internet Explorer

2) Type: http://gasmsgboard.dev.corp.enron.com (or just open this email and 
click on above URL)

3) Users should see the messages if there is any new messages for today. If 
they don't see any messages, there are two reasons: 
 (1) They are not valid users. Their names have not been added into the NT 
Web_GasTraders Group yet. Please contact Chrysti Hardy to add their names 
into the group.
 (2) There is no new messages added yet.

4) Click on "Comments" button to add messages: there will be a popup window 
when user clicks on "comments" button. There are two ways to send the 
messages after typing the 
messages into the text box:
 (1) just simply press enter to send the message. or
 (2) click on "send" button to send the message.

5) After the message has been sent, The message will be displayed on the main 
window immediately, the rest people who are online will get the new message 
in less than 30 seconds. This time can be reduced to as less as 1 second. 
However, I would not recommend to reduce the time interval less than 10 
second.  Because each time the browser refreshes the screen, the screen will 
be blink. Users don't want the screen blink every second while they read the 
messages.

6) All messages will be cleaned up daily at 6:00PM. If they like to clean 
them up later than 6:00PM, please let me know. I can reset the time.

Note: Right now the application is under test environment. If they like it, I 
will move it into production environment soon.

Let me know any feedbacks.

Thanks,

Fangming

Darren, per our earlier conversation, here are the facts related to the opportunity to service a plant in the Freeport area off of Dow.

The potential customer (Don Owen) has supplied this plant for the past 15 years, buying supply from Dow.
Dow does not want to be a supplier in the future, but of course, will transport.
Dow will quote only a 2 year transport ($0.06 from Katy to the plant), but the customer wants a minimum of 5 years.
Other bids he is getting at Index + .03/.04 less whatever transport.
The swing load is approx. 1300-1350 MMBtu/d,  but fairly steady he says.

Let me know if you have any interest or if I should pass this along to someone else. Thanks.

PS The customer will give more info if we are interested, but wanted to see if we have interest first (and also if we had long term capacity on Dow)

Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.

I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.

And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.


Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information.  Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov.  Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either:  Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 507-6400, Fax:  (713) 507-6808; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 853-3956, Fax:  (713) 646-3002.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered "participants in the solicitation" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

California=01,s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last seve=
ral=20
months.  Unfortunately, this debate has generated more heat than light.  We=
=20
want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.=
 =20
Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation=
=20
and our position on California energy issues.

What happened in California

The source of California=01,s current problem is as straightforward as supp=
ly=20
and demand.  California=01,s economy grew 29 percent since 1998.  This incr=
eased=20
the demand for electricity by 24 percent.  At the same time, regulatory=20
restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state.  So=
=20
demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added.  The resul=
t,=20
predictably, is a shortage.  This summer, peak capacity will be about 10=20
percent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state.

In addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related=
=20
factors that led to the current crisis.  First, the state=01,s regulations=
=20
forced all sales and purchases into the spot market.  The spot market for=
=20
power is extraordinarily volatile.  The way firms behave in a free market=
=20
when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo=
ng=20
term, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.  I=
n=20
California, state regulation prevented this strategy.  This would be the=20
equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th=
e=20
most volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine=20
while the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawat=
t=20
was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price.

Second, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remain=
ed=20
in effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep=20
competition out.  This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa=
le=20
prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the=20
regulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt.

In short, California=01,s problems were caused by regulation, not deregulat=
ion. =20
Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new=
=20
generation from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile=
=20
spot prices.

At the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned=
=20
the state=01,s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, w=
hich,=20
if adopted, would have averted the current crisis.

Enron=01,s Role

Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f=
ix=20
the problem.  Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the=20
politicians and the media.  Here are the facts:

? Other than a small amount of wind power, Enron is not a generator in the=
=20
state of California.  Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the=
=20
same market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a=20
market maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.  We ar=
e=20
interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc=
ts=20
for our customers.
? As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from=
=20
the problems the states=01, utilities, and their customers, now face.  We=
=20
protected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility.

You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply=20
power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on=
=20
the open market.  Early reports mischaracterized this as a =01&turnback=018=
 of our=20
customers to the utilities.  Here are the facts:

? As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California=20
market, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct=
ly=20
from the utilities.  This decision reduced EES=01,s market price risk by=20
allowing EES to access lower utility rates.
? EES did not terminate any customer contracts, and our customers continue =
to=20
receive the financial benefits of their contract prices.
? EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them=
=20
with other energy-related products and services, including assistance in=20
reducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times.

Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its=
=20
crisis; Enron continues to sign up customers in the state; and Enron=20
continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western=
=20
power markets.  Enron=01,s primary business is managing risk for our custom=
ers=20
with solutions customized to meet their needs.  There has never been more=
=20
demand for our products and services.

The Solution

The solution to California=01,s crisis is also straightforward.  In summary=
, the=20
state must increase supply, reduce demand, reduce reliance on the spot mark=
et=20
and shore up the financial stability of the state=01,s utilities.

Increasing Supply

California=01,s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing=
=20
short of Byzantine.  Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les=
s=20
than a year.  In California, it often takes 5 to 7 years.  California simpl=
y=20
must streamline this process.  Ironically, while many of the regulations=20
generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality, the=
=20
regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and=20
displacing current plants, which emit 40 times as much NOx.  California can=
=20
have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new=20
facilities.

Reducing Demand

Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand. =
=20
They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is.  An open retail=
=20
market would trigger demand responses, which would balance supply and deman=
d=20
at lower prices than today.  California should fully open its retail market=
.

Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market

In a truly deregulated market, customers would protect themselves from=20
volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer=
=20
term, fixed-price basis.  The state has instead left procurement in the han=
ds=20
of the utilities, which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market=
. =20
Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the=
ir=20
price risk.

Restoring the Financial Integrity of the State=01,s Institutions

The utilities in California are not paying their bills.  This has led to=20
greater uncertainty in the market, higher costs, and reduced flexibility to=
=20
arrive at lasting solutions.  California must permit its utilities to recov=
er=20
their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and=
=20
distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is=
=20
needed.

Just as important as doing these things, the state must avoid policies that=
,=20
while politically attractive, do not fix the problem or even make matters=
=20
worse.  Price caps have been proposed.  They don=01,t work; have never work=
ed;=20
and they will not work here.  Price caps succeed only in creating shortages=
,=20
which then have to be allocated among competing users.  Imagine how=20
ineffectively the government would be in determining, for example, whether =
it=20
is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall=
ey=20
or Silicon Valley.  Price caps are a surefire way to make the current=20
shortage worse.

The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in=20
California.  There is no reason to believe, and every reason to doubt, that=
=20
the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in,=20
constructing, operating and maintaining assets.  This will also result in=
=20
California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power=20
generation -- which the private sector can do -- instead of education, road=
s=20
and other public goods -- which the private sector cannot do.

As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t=
he=20
crisis from the media, it=01,s important for you to know this:  We at Enron=
 will=20
continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real=20
solutions to the state.

We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change=
s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=
=20
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit=
y=20
for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=
orth=20
America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=
=20
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=
he=20
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=
=20
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=

will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =
of=20
the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=
ness=20
into Enron Global Assets in the near future.
=20
Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined=
=20
EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi=
ll=20
focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to=
=20
the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE=
S=20
to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or=
der=20
to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20

at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout=
h=20
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=

=20
for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20

the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=

efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=
=20
EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These=
=20
newly defined roles are as follows:

Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=
e=20
Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works,=
=20
with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20
President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat=
ed=20
services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these=
=20
services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=
=20
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=
=20
for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.
Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.
Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =
on a=20
regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in=
=20
the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all=
=20
European and Eastern Hemisphere operations.  Rick and Mark will also contin=
ue=20
to support all other Enron businesses operating in their respective regions=
=20
and will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chi=
ef=20
of Staff.
Public Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a region=
al=20
basis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity,=20
Enron Net Works, and Enron Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue=
=20
in her role for Enron Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble=
r=20
will have responsibility for activity outside North America and Europe as=

well as providing support for Enron Global Markets and Enron Global Assets.=

These individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship=

to Mark Palmer, Vice President of Communications.
Business Analysis and Reporting =01) Wes Colwell will expand his role to co=

EWS reporting in addition to his current role in North America.

 As part of our company-wide initiative to examine our assets and investmen=

around the world, we are considering a variety of options with respect to=

EGEP and EWC.  As a consequence, we are putting these businesses under Clif=

CORPORATE STAFF

 We are consolidating the corporate staff functions: Human Resources,=20

COMMITTEE STRUCTURE

 In light of the increased leadership opportunities created by Enron=01,s=

Enron is forming a new organization - - the Enron Xcelerator - - to drive the 
formation and development of new businesses at Enron.  Enron's unique ability 
to start and develop new businesses has driven most of our growth over the 
years.  Lou L. Pai, currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Energy Services, will 
lead the Xcelerator.  Over his years at Enron, Lou has been key to the 
creation and rapid growth of our wholesale gas, wholesale power and energy 
service businesses.  The existing business units will continue their 
development of core businesses, while the Xcelerator will be responsible for 
developing new business opportunities that are natural extensions of Enron's 
business model and core skills, but not currently under development elsewhere 
in Enron.

Dave Delainey, currently President and CEO of Enron Americas, will become 
Chairman and CEO of Enron Energy Services.  Dave brings a wealth of 
experience and accomplishment from Enron Wholesale Services' businesses where 
he led the growth of our Canadian business and our North American origination 
activity and, most recently, had a great year in Enron Americas.

Dave is forming an Office of the Chairman in EES.  Joining Dave in the Office 
of the Chairman are Dan Leff, President of EES, Global Energy Services, and 
Marty Sunde, President of EES, Global Marketing and Services.  Dan and Marty 
have been instrumental in the development and execution of the successful EES 
business model.  Also joining the Office of the Chairman of EES is Janet 
Dietrich as Chief Operating Officer.  Janet, currently is Managing Director 
in Enron Americas, where she has been successful in many of Enron Wholesale's 
core businesses, including gas trading, risk management and structural 
origination.  Tom White will continue as Vice Chairman of EES and will focus 
on the development and expansion of EES' customer relationships.  Lou, Tom, 
Dan, Marty and the entire EES organization have developed a great business 
model with great growth prospects.  EES has become an essential part of 
Enron's market valuation and growth story.  This new leadership structure 
will enable EES to continue on its path of sustained growth and increasing 
profitability.

John Lavorato will succeed Dave as President and CEO of Enron Americas.  John 
has been an essential part of Enron's energy trading success over the years 
and is a key part of Enron Wholesale Services' continuing success story.  
Joining John is Louise Kitchen, currently President and CEO of Enron 
NetWorks.  Louise, who accelerated Enron's outstanding growth with the 
deployment of EnronOnline, will take over as Chief Operating Officer of Enron 
Americas.

Philippe Bibi, currently Chief Operating Officer of Enron NetWorks will take 
over as President and CEO of Enron NetWorks.  Under Philippe's leadership, 
Enron has become a technology leader and the leading e-commerce company.  
Joining Philippe as Chief Operating Officer is Greg Piper, currently Managing 
Director of Enron NetWorks.  Greg currently leads Enron NetWork's origination 
activity and was responsible for the creation and deployment of ClickPaper, 
Enron's successful online pulp and paper marketplace.

Please join us in congratulating all of these individuals on their 
achievements and their new responsibilities.

All:

Attached you will find a list that reflects your seat assignments for Business Continuity Planning (BCP).  These seats are located on the 30th and 31st Floors of Enron Center North (ECN).  As previously communicated, you will report to these designated seats in the event of an outage in ECS.

The exception to this is as follows:
If your seat assignment is located on the 31st Floor, you will report to your original location that you occupied prior to your move into ECS.  This will hold true until the Monday after Thanksgiving, as we will have the 31st floor seats set up at that time.

Testing:
Once you have moved to ECS, if you would like to test your BCP location, you will be able to test your seat for functionality every Thursday from 3-6pm.  Testing is not required, but is highly recommended.

If anyone has any questions or concerns about these procedures, please feel free to contact me at any time.

Attached are the notes captured from the whiteboard and discussions on 
Wednesday (as best as I can decipher).  Please note the next steps we 
discussed:

Commitment of key subject experts (who, how much time dedicated)
Establishment of the project steering team
Detail out high level use cases

Thanks for your participation in the meeting, and I look forward to working 
with you to create another great system.

There is a new version of Stack Manager which is being released this evening, 
for use on Monday morning.

Changes

1) "Inactivate Suspended Children" - New menu item available by 
right-clicking on a Parent Product. It will change all Child Products of the 
highlighted parent from "Suspended" to "Inactive". Note that this will be 
applied only to the product which you highlight. It will also show available 
when highlighting Products which are not Parents, but it will have no effect.

2) The transaction list has been amended to correctly display only those 
transactions completed on the calendar day (problem has affected Australia 
and Singapore).

3) A Constant Spread which is changed from the front page of the Stack 
Manager will stay as changed for that Product. The spread will persist even 
if transactions occur.


Background

Suspended Child Products continue to have their prices updated as the price 
of the Parent changes. Inactive Child Products do not have their prices 
updated. The price update process slows down EnronOnline processing and Stack 
Manager response, so it is advantageous to ensure all non-active Products are 
in an Inactive state. 

If you have any questions on the above, please contact the EnronOnline call 
center at:

North America: 713 853 4357 (HELP)
Asia and Australia: +61 2 9229 2300

It is amazing and yet not surprising how much Enron has accomplished in the=
=20
first six months of this year. You continue to make it happen.  We recogniz=
e=20
that you work hard every day to accomplish Enron=01,s business goals, and w=
e are=20
pleased that many of you have shared in the company=01,s financial success=
=20
through Enron stock options.=20

As you may know, the current employee stock option program (also known as t=
he=20
All Employee Stock Option Program or AESOP) began in 1994 and provided valu=
e=20
to participants through 2000.  Employees who have participated in this=20
program from its inception have realized a 1,119% increase in the value of=
=20
their stock options (assuming a stock price of $70) over the life of the=20
program.  =20

Enron stock options are a valuable part of your total compensation package=
=20
and a contributing factor to your performance and to Enron=01,s continued=
=20
success.  Therefore, the Enron Executive Committee and the Compensation and=
=20
Management Development Committee of the Enron Board of Directors have decid=
ed=20
to continue to offer stock options as a part of your compensation package.

On May 1, 2000, the Committee approved an employee stock option program for=
=20
calendar years 2001 - 2005 (EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program).  =
It is=20
expected that EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will be granted,=
=20
effective on or about December 29, 2000, for those employees who are eligib=
le=20
on that date (please see note below).  The new program, which is subject to=
=20
final approval by Enron=01,s Board of Directors, is as follows:

? EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will give stock options to=20
eligible full-time and part-time regular employees in domestic and=20
international companies/locations.
? The grant of non-qualified stock options will equal 25% of annual base=20
salary (5% of annual base salary for each year of a 5-year period) on=20
December 29, 2000. (Salary calculation and value may vary in some=20
international locations.)
? The Board will grant the stock options on December 29, 2000.
? Eligible employees hired in subsequent years will receive a prorated gran=
t=20
of stock options.

Why commit your talent and energy to Enron?  EnronOptions =01) Your Stock O=
ption=20
Program, among other good reasons=01( that=01,s why.

In the coming weeks, you will be receiving more details about EnronOptions =
=01)=20
Your Stock Option Program.  To provide information and answer your question=
s,=20
we will introduce a special link on the Human Resources web-site, host=20
several eSpeak sessions and continue to communicate with you on a regular=
=20
basis.  In the meantime, if you have immediate questions, please contact yo=
ur=20
Human Resources representative.=20

Note: In addition to final approval by Enron=01,s Board of Directors, grant=
ing=20
of options will be subject to New York Stock Exchange and state and federal=
=20
regulatory requirements.  It is expected that EnronOptions =01) Your Stock=
=20
Option Program will be available to most Enron employees; however, some Enr=
on=20
companies=01, employees may not be eligible due to legal, accounting, tax, =
labor=20
or business issues.  As you know, Enron changes to meet the needs of the=20
marketplaces we serve.  Given that need to change, we will continue to refi=
ne=20
the eligibility for EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program and will=20
communicate more details throughout the year with final eligibility being=
=20
determined on December 29, 2000.

Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate selected: 
1.	L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for any damage to it. 
2.	Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)

To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact Jeff Leath at 713-646-6165.

Password Deletion

It has been noted that many users have passwords which match or are similar 
to their User ID's for internal EnronOnline applications (Stack Manager, 
Product Manager, EOL Reports).

This is a significant security concern. Therefore, there will be a sweep of 
ID's and passwords at the end of the day on Thursday, April 5. Any User ID's 
which have passwords similar to the User ID will be subject to deletion.

Changing Your Password

Passwords can be changed in either the Stack Manager or in EOL Reports.

To change your password in the Stack Manager, once logged on, go to toolbar & 
select "Help" and then select "Change Password".
The system will request you to enter your NEW password twice. 

To change your passsword in EOL Reports, open the Reports application, log 
in, select "Options" and "Change Password".The system will request you to 
enter your NEW password twice. Please note that the password change 
functionality within the Reports application is new. If it does not appear on 
your menu and you are running on a standalone machine, you will need to 
logout at the windows level and then login again to receive the updated 
version.

If you have any questions, please call the EnronOnline Help Desk (Houston: 
713 853 4357,  London: + 44 20 7783 7783)

Thank you for your assistance in preserving appropriate security.

Dave

Subject: Good Friday

On Friday, April 21, 2000, the NYMEX and equity markets will be closed.  As a 
result, there will not be a Daily Position Report issued for this date.  The 
London office will be closed on Friday, April 21 and the following Monday, 
April 24.   Due to the fact that most risk groups are not planning on being 
in the office on Friday, the DPR for Thursday's business will be prepared and 
issued on Monday, April 24.   

Please contact me at extension 35242 or Chris Abel at extension 33102 if you 
have any questions or comments.

Team,

As I mentioned in our HPL staff meeting we are investigating the merits of 
entering into a joint venture or another transaction structure that will 
position HPL to effectively compete in the Texas intrastate market.  Our 
primary objective is to gain access to additional sources of gas supply and 
achieve the required economies of scale to compete with other intrastate 
pipelines. I would appreciate your confidence and support in developing the 
optimal course of action for HPL and for Enron. 

The skills that we have developed in our group are critical to growing our 
Upstream Origination business in N. America, as well as to the ongoing 
operation of HPL.  Our origination strategy is to leverage our business 
operations, field operations, engineering, producer services, and marketing 
skills to capture value from transportation, gathering, storage and commodity 
opportunities on the gas/power grids.   We need our current employees to 
accomplish this objective across N. America.

We have proven our ability to add value to Enron by developing the 
Powder/Wind River pipelines, installing electric compressors, contracting for 
processing capacity, and establishing a new gas supply corridor along the 
Gulf Coast.  Our recent efforts to provide services such as business 
operations, measurement, trading/marketing, and accounting services to third 
party producers and pipelines also looks to be a promising growth opportunity.

It is very important to our ongoing business relationships and our 
competitive position in the market place that we DO NOT discuss HPL related 
matters with third parties.  Please come see me if you have any specific 
questions or concerns.  Also please refer any third party inquiries regarding 
HPL to Tim Determing.

Regards,
Brian

It is with sadness and regret that we announce that Cliff Baxter is resigning as an employee of Enron.  We are happy, though, that Cliff's primary reason for resigning is to spend more time with his family.

Cliff is a unique talent.  His creativity, intelligence, sense of humor, and straightforward manner have been assets to the company throughout his career.  He will be missed.

Cliff joined Enron in 1991 and was a key member of the team that built Enron's wholesale business.  Before becoming Vice Chairman of Enron, Cliff served in a variety of positions in Enron's wholesale businesses, culminating in his appointment as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Enron North America in 1999.

We have asked Cliff, and he has agreed, to continue in a consulting role for the company while concluding negotiations on a number of key asset dispositions.

Please join us in thanking Cliff for his service to the company and in wishing him the very best.

As you are aware, legal is coordinating with the trading/origination groups in handling consensual termination transactions of our in-the-money positions with counterparties that are willing to do so.   Could you please spread the word that these transactions should NOT be done by entering into offsetting trades, but rather by entering into a Termination Agreement with our counterparty and the counterparty paying to Enron the agreed upon value.  Thanks.

The tragedy of Tuesday, September 11 will serve as an unforgettable reminder to people all over the world of what is truly important and of life's fragility.  My heartfelt sympathies go out to the families and friends of all the people whose lives were taken in this senseless and horrific attack.  I ask that all of you keep our deceased colleague Nick Humber and his family in your thoughts and prayers.  Tragically, Nick, a director with Enron Wind, was on one of the planes hijacked on Tuesday.
To help with relief efforts in New York and Washington, D.C., Enron will make a total contribution of $1 million dollars to be split equally between the American Red Cross and the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund.
Many of you have expressed an interest in more personal involvement and I want you to be aware of some of the options available.  I encourage you to support those impacted by this tragedy by donating to relief efforts, and to take advantage of our Matching Gift Program to double the impact of your individual donation.  Because of the significance of this tragic event, Enron will match your contribution 2 for 1.

How to Help
?  Please go to www.easymatch.com/enron. Once there, click on "Disaster Relief"  (located in the middle of the top of the page).  Please choose from the list of non-profits that are accepting donations to help with this effort.  Any donations made to aid with disaster relief will not be counted toward the annual $15,000 Matching Gift limit.   You will need your GIS number to do this (it begins with a 9).  If you are unsure of your GIS number, please contact the HR GIM helpdesk at 713-853-5666. 

?  We will have red, white and blue striped ribbons in Houston for employees to pin on their shirts in memory of those who lost their lives, in honor of those who survived, and for their families.  Donations to the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund and other organizations are being accepted in exchange for the ribbons.  Enron will also match these donations.  The  ribbons are available tomorrow from 9:00 - 11:00 a.m. at the InfoZone, which is located by the down escalator in the lobby.   For any other employees who would like to make donations, please go to the above website.  

?  Enron employees are generously giving blood, and we will continue to work with relief efforts to ensure that employees who want to give, have the ability to do so.  If you have questions, call 713-853-6100. 

?  President Bush has declared Friday a day of "National Prayer and Remembrance," and is calling on Americans to use their lunch breaks to go to places of worship to pray for victims and their families.   Following is a list of websites with additional information: 

o	<http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/> 
o	<http://www.chron.com/content/community/religious/>
o	If you are looking for a service within walking distance of the Enron building, First United Methodist Church (corner of Main and Clay) and Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will hold prayer services on Friday.  First United Methodist Church will have services at 11:00 a.m., noon and 1:00 p.m.  Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will have a service at noon.  
o If you are interested in attending a service and don't work in this area, please check your local television websites for more information. 


?  For Houston employees, a citywide candlelight vigil will be held on the steps of City Hall in Downtown Houston at 7 p.m. tomorrow night.  Mayor Lee Brown will be speaking.  

?  At 10:00 a.m. (Central) on Monday, September 17th, in Enron facilities around the world, we will have a moment of silence in memory of  those whose lives have been tragically taken.  We ask that you put down the phone, turn away from your computer and dedicate a personal moment of silence together with your co-workers.  

?  We encourage all U.S. based employees to wear red, white or blue shirts on Monday.

For Counseling Assistance
?  For employees in Houston, we have an on-site employee assistance counselor in the building that you can reach by calling 713-853-6057.  If you are not located in Houston or if you or a family member would prefer an off-site counselor, you can call the 24-hour Employee Assistance Program number 1-800-345-1391. 

?  Employees outside the U.S. can also contact 713-853-6057 directly.  United HealthGroup (Enron's medical network administrator) has provided free access to their National Disaster Line for counseling service to any person.  That number is 800-268-1026.  We are also working to bring crisis counseling to any work location that has a need.

This is an agonizing time for our nation and it is hard for us all.  In addition to the financial and human support we are extending to those in need, it is imperative that we at Enron continue to safely and reliably serve our customers in the U.S. and around the world.  We know it is difficult but we must demonstrate on-going stability and strength at Enron, as this will serve as a signal that the ideals upon which America was founded cannot be diminished.  Again, our hearts go out to the families and friends of those who have lost loved ones in this tragedy.  Please continue to watch your e-mail for more information.

We will soon be migrating to Windows 2000 and Outlook.  The Texas Desk is 
scheduled for Tuesday, April 10th.  I was told to pass along the following 
information to my group:

1.  You will be receiving emails from the migration team ("GEM") - please be 
sure to only open this from your own desktop, and not remotely.  This is very 
important.  These messages will be explaining the migration process and what 
you need to do to insure a successful migration.

2.  Due to new space limitations on your mailbox, you are advised to clean 
your Notes mailbox of old, unneeded messages BEFORE migration.  With Outlook, 
you will be restricted to a Mailbox size of 100 MB.  Outlook will issue a 
warning once you reach 75 MB to let you know that you are near your Mailbox 
Limit.  Once you reach 100 MB, you will be prevented from sending email, but 
you will still be able to receive internal and external messages  You will 
then need to reduce the size of your mailbox by deleting old mail, saving 
attachments to a local drive, etc. before you will be able to send an email 
again.

3.  From the day of migration, only 30 days of old mail will be migrated from 
your mailbox.  This includes mail in your inbox and other folders.  Calendar 
items dating back one year from the day of migration will be migrated.

4.  Everyone will have a read only view of Notes until the transition is 
completed.  You will be able to copy/paste.

Thanks,
Laura

As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

To All Employees:

This morning Enron took a series of actions designed to stabilize our situation and preserve the value in our businesses:

-- We filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Contrary to popular belief, this does not mean we are out of business. What it does mean is that we have entered into a court-supervised process by which we can continue to operate most of our businesses, reorganize our finances, and explore various strategic, operational and financial alternatives, including the sale of non-core assets, in an orderly manner.


-- In connection with our filing for Chapter 11 reorganization, Enron is in active discussions with leading financial institutions for debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing and expects to complete these discussions shortly. Upon the completion and court approval of these arrangements, the new funding will be available immediately on an interim basis to supplement Enron's existing capital and help the Company fulfill obligations associated with operating its business, including its employee payroll and payments to vendors for goods and services provided on or after today's filing.

-- We filed a lawsuit against Dynegy, alleging breach of contract and other causes of action for Dynegy's wrongful termination of our proposed merger. We are asking the court for damages of not less than $10 billion.

-- We also announced this morning that we are in active discussions with various leading financial institutions about providing financial support to recapitalize and revitalize the company's wholesale energy trading operations under a new ownership structure. As contemplated, this recapitalized entity will be staffed with people from Enron's current wholesale energy trading team, and will conduct counterparty transactions through EnronOnline.

These are the first steps in a strategic restructuring process that will allow Enron to meet its obligations to its creditors and preserve the value in our core wholesale energy trading business. From an operational standpoint, our energy businesses - including our pipelines, utilities and other energy assets - are conducting safe and normal operations around the world, and will continue to do so.

As you know, the second and unavoidable part of our restructuring is to improve our financial position by implementing a comprehensive cost-savings program. This will entail a significant reduction in our work force. This is painful for all of us and our goal is for as many of you as is possible to know where you stand by the end of the day Tuesday, though in some cases notification will take longer.

For our friends and colleagues who will lose their jobs as part of this process, you will remain on the company payroll for now. In addition, we will submit a severance pay plan to the Bankruptcy Court for approval. This approval must be received before we can begin paying severance benefits. We will be providing more information about this plan as soon as the Court has made its determination.

I know these actions raise new questions about our company's future and what this means for each of us. Your business unit leader will be holding floor meetings on Monday to discuss these events with you. In addition, you can access a copy of the press release on  <http://home.enron.com/>. We will also have a Q&A and other materials for you on Monday. While there is a great deal we simply don't know yet, we hope these materials will help answer at least some of your questions.

When decisions are made affecting our company, people, and operations, we will let you know as quickly as possible. There is still considerable value and opportunity in our business. The strategic restructuring process that we are beginning will allow us to preserve that value and those opportunities.

On behalf of the Board and entire management team, we greatly appreciate your patience, your professionalism and whatever support you can offer each other as we navigate through these tough times to a better future.

Ken

With SAP now here there are going to be a few minor changes that we will all 
have to make immediately.  
First:
Everyone will have to make Internet Explorer their Default Browser.  If 
you're not sure how to do this give me a call and I will help.  The reason 
for this is that our new TimeSheet Program will only run through Internet 
Explorer.

Second: 
Sometime next week we will have a brown bag lunch where I will walk you 
through entering your time in this New System.  It's not time consuming just 
different.

Third:
Next  Thursday you will be e-mailed an SAP log-on ID and Password.  Please 
don't delete or disregard the importance of this e-mail.  You will need it to 
key your time.

Fourth:
All company and RC #'s are changing.  The company part is easy. It will be 4 
digits so if your company number is currently 413 it will now be 0413 or if 
it is 012 it will now be 0012. Easy.  RC #'s are now called Cost Centers and 
they are changing completely.  Please write these down somewhere you will 
need them just like you need to know your RC.

RC 1497 = CC 105633 
RC 1638 = CC 105634
RC 2664 = CC 105630
RC 2933 = CC 106292
RC 0688 = CC 105631
RC 1160  = CC 105632
RC 2675 =  CC 105638
RC 2939 = CC 106269
RC 2940 = CC 106290
RC 2663 = CC 105629

The transition shouldn't be too painful for you but it promises to be a 
little stressful for your assistants so please bear with us and cooperate.

Thank You!
Yvette

within Gas Operations, excluding Texas.  Attached is an organizational chart 
for the Texas region.  

We too continue to look for efficiencies to ensure we meet the demands of our 
customers.  We currently support the Texas trading region, Bammel Storage 
Facility, Houston Pipeline, Powder River Gathering and Bridgeline.  I am 
pleased to announce that we will also combine Risk Management, Deal 
Validation and Operational Analysis under the management of Steve Venturatos 
who will serve as the Business Controller.  Dave Baumbach will fill the Lead 
position.  Ami Chokshi will move from Trading Support to the new group, 
continuing in the role of the Entex and TUFCO account manager.  Jody Crook 
also will join the team.  Bryan Hull will transition his knowledge over the 
next month, and will be moving to has second rotation, effective 6/5/00.  
Additionally, Will Kelly will transition the Denver trading books to the 
Texas team as he moves to the East Region.  Transportation Management under 
Mary Smith will NOT be integrated into the team as their day-to-day 
responsibilities and projects are not cohesively aligned with this group.  
Please join me in welcoming the new team members as well as the team members 
who will continue in the group.

Mike Eiben will step in the role previously managed by Steve Venturatos which 
includes Global Contracts and Facilities, System Enhancements and Regulatory 
Reporting.  In addition, Clem Cernosek and Jennifer Pattison will be assuming 
new responsibilities in Logistics and Volume Management, respectively.  Both 
Clem and Jennifer have been on the Unify team, focused on POPS.  Please wish 
these folks success in their new roles.

All responsibility changes are effective 5/1/00.



Please share this with your staffs.

The New Power Company, the first national residential and small business 
energy service provider in deregulated
markets was launched today with strategic investors and partners including 
Enron, IBM and America Online.

H. Eugene Lockhart has been named President and Chief Executive Officer of 
the company.  He was formerly President
of AT&T Consumer Services and Chief Marketing Officer of AT&T, as well as 
President of Bank America's Global Retail
Bank and President and CEO of MasterCard International.  Lockhart is joined 
by a number of high-level executives from
the telecommunications and financial services sectors as well as several 
former Enron executives specializing in energy
commodity pricing, marketing, risk management and government regulatory 
affairs.   

The former Enron employees include Jim Badum, formerly Managing Director of 
Consumer Services at EES, John Henderson, 
formerly Vice President of Retail Risk Management for EES, Dave Eichinger, 
formerly Vice President of Corporate Development
for Enron Corp., and Kathleen Magruder, formerly Vice President of Government 
Affairs for Enron Corp.  Lou Pai, Chairman and
CEO for EES will serve as non-executive Chairman of The New Power Company. 

Enron will provide The New Power Company with energy commodity pricing, risk 
management, and government/
regulatory affairs.  Ken Lay is quoted in the news release, "We've studied 
the residential and small business market
for several years and believe this is the optimal way to provide value to 
these customers.  By assisting in setting up
an independent company, Enron is able to leverage its core competencies of 
energy and risk management, while
partnering with other industry leaders to give The New Power Company 
extraordinary and immediate depth and
capability."  Ken will also serve on the Board of Directors.

The New Power Company is scheduled to initially provide service in 
Pennsylvania and New Jersey in the second half
of 2000.  The company will be headquartered in Greenwich, Connecticut, with 
some operations in Houston.

Subject: Project Hurricane/Bridgeline Status

Here is a quick status and list of to do's related to setting up the new J.V. 
between Enron & Texaco which will be combining the LRC and Bridgeline 
pipeline systems:

Summary:  The LRC & Bridgeline pipeline systems will be combined under the 
name of Bridgeline LLC.  Ownership in the JV will be split 60% Texaco & 40% 
Enron.  Bridgeline Gas Marketing LLC will be the entity that will be trading 
on the pipelines under the new J.V.  Contracts and Service  Agreements are in 
the process of being drafted.  

Enron will be providing the Trading and Commercial Operations systems to 
support this J.V.  Texaco will be providing the Scada system.  I understand 
that Accounting is still being discussed.  The Trading, Risk, & perhaps 
Scheduling personnel for this JV will be initially relocated to the 21st 
floor of the Enron Building and will eventually move to probably the 3 Allen 
Center once a more permanent spot can be built out.  Trading for the new JV 
will start in early February for March Production.

To Do's:

Accounting:  I've asked Jim Coffey to set up two work orders to capture IT 
transition and ongoing costs.  Texaco is also trying to set up a meeting next 
Monday to step through the accounting flow so that we are all on the same 
page and make sure there is nothing that will fall through the cracks.

PC's:  Jim Fussell is in the process of ordering the PC's for this JV at my 
request.  I will need the work order numbers to track these costs.

Networks:  I'm coordinating with Arshak and his team to make sure that the 
voice and data networks are in place for EB 21.  Once the more permanent spot 
is nailed down we will then need to do the same for that location.   A 
combination of Trader phones, Lucent Phones, Stenfons and Amtels have been 
requested.

Location on EB 21:  I'm waiting on a call back from Chris Larson from 
facilities to find out what locations on 21 will be assigned to the new JV.  
Currently half of the floor is empty but they are set up with high wall 
cubes.  There may need to be some build out for the traders to low wall 
cubes.  We can't set up the PC's, phones, Amtels, etc until this is done.

Data Conversion:  I have requested from Texaco the contract, deal and 
meter/facility information we will need to set up in our systems to begin 
trading for March production.  It may be possible to get an electronic dump 
of this data from Texaco if Enron defines the data fields that we will need.  
We also need to set up the trading entities and portfolios.  I will also need 
to know who will need to have access to this data so that we can set up the 
system security.  I have received the names of the traders but I don't know 
who else will need access.

Interface between Enron's Unify POP's application and Bridgeline's Scada 
application:  I've asked Dave Nommensen from Enron to get with Carryn Wright 
from Texaco to begin the process of defining the interface between the two 
applications and estimate the time to build and implement the interface.  
There will also need to be a transition plan put in place where LRC's 
RTU's/EFM is redirected to the Bridgeline Scada system.  In the meantime 
there will be two Scada systems and perhaps two Gas Controls until everything 
is merged into one.  This will probably mean some manual interfaces between 
POP's and Scada for Confirmed noms and EFM volumes until the transition is 
complete.

Scada Communications:  Currently the LRC RTU's/EFM communicate back to 
Enron's Scada system via leased lines.  Bridgelines RTU's communicate back to 
them via a microwave system.  The new JV could save on communications costs 
by switching LRC's RTU communication to the microwave.  Perhaps this is best 
done as a part of the Scada transition.

Accounting data needed by Texaco for Royalty purposes:  This data needs to be 
better defined.  I will follow up with John LeDoux from Texaco to get this 
process started.

Hourly volumes:  Bridgeline currently has one utility customer who may be 
billed on an hourly basis depending on the amount of swing.  We need to talk 
through this process to see what enhancements may be needed.  At least 
initially there will need to be some manual processes in place to support the 
billing for this one customer.

Please let me know if you'd like to meet on any of these topics.  I can have 
my assistant set up the meeting if needed.  In the mean time I can be reached 
at 713-853-6858.  Thanks!  -  Tommy

TO: Houston Area Employees Participating in the Domestic Medical Plan Benefits

You may have recently received communication from United HealthCare (UHC) 
concerning Memorial Hermann Health Systems' (MHHS) decision to terminate 
their contract with UHC  in the Houston/Beaumont area.  This communication 
also included the names of physicians who will be dropped from the network 
due to this action.  It is our intent to help you understand the situation.

It is our understanding that Memorial Herman Health Systems asked for a 40% 
increase in fees - a substantial increase that would have been passed on to 
you and Enron!  When United HealthCare attempted to negotiate with a counter 
proposal, Memorial Hermann cancelled their contract.

While this contractual arrangement was between the hospital system and UHC, 
Enron continues to support UHC in their ongoing contract negotiation 
efforts.  At this time, it is only UHC which has been affected, however, it 
is our understanding that Cigna has also been contacted by the hospital group 
and may be in contract negotiations at this time as well.  

Many doctors have obtained admission privileges to other area hospitals 
within the UHC Network or have contracted directly with UHC including those 
with admission privileges to The Woodlands, Sugarland and Clear Lake 
Hospitals, to name a few.  In a further effort to limit disruption to our 
affected employees and families who are enrolled in the UHC Network or EPO 
options, Enron has authorized UHC to process claims incurred between 
September 28 and December 31, 2000 as if the termination of the Memorial 
Hermann Health Systems from the network had not occurred and In-Network 
benefits applied.  Office visits will have a $10 copayment and all other 
charges will be covered at 90%.  Hospital admissions will still need to be 
pre-certified with UHC.

These steps have decreased the number of participants' affected by Primary 
Care Physician disruption from 1,050 to 127.

If You Need Medical Attention:  You or your doctor/hospital must call UHC's 
customer service number so proper benefits can be verified.  In some cases 
the hospital or doctor may request payment at the time service is performed.  
If this should happen, please obtain an itemized statement and submit it to 
UHC with a claim form for prompt reimbursement.  Claim forms can be obtained 
by calling 1-800-332-7979 or in Houston at 713-853-7979 ( press 1).

Open enrollment materials will be coming soon.  Take this opportunity to 
consider your elections for 2001.  

United HealthCare and Enron HR are committed to assisting Enron employees 
through this transition.  We will communicate any  further developments that 
may impact you or your family.

As part of an effort to facilitate communication on the trading floor, we 
have set everyone up with Microsoft Messenger.  
For those of you not familiar with the program, Microsoft Messenger allows 
you to talk real time with anyone on your contact 
list.  The program also has voice capabilities if you have a microphone.  
Messenger should now be fully installed on your 
computer and is accessible from the Start Menu.

You will need to set up a Hotmail account in order to use this service.  
Please follow the link below to set up your account. 
Once you have created an ID, please email me back with your ID so that I can 
compile a contact list for everyone on the floor.  
Let me know if you need help getting set up.

A word of caution when using the program.  Because this is not behind the 
company firewall, anything you send is not 100% secure and 
could be intercepted by a third party.  Any sensitive pricing information 
that you do not want disclosed should not be transmitted over
the program.

To all: 

The proposed sale of HPL to American Electric Power (AEP) has been signed and 
the conditions for the acquisition should be completed within the coming 
months.  Over the next few days, I will be forwarding more details about the 
transition process.  These details will outline the employment opportunities 
and transfer process to AEP.   AEP is eager to complete these arrangements, 
as the pipeline is only as valuable as the people who operate it.

During the transition period, it is important that we keep the pipe line 
operating at our historical level of reliability in order to meet the energy 
needs of our customers.

Regards,
Brian

=20
pay advice throughout the year.  (Note that your W2 at the end of the year=
=20
will reflect your earnings by company).

Payroll FAQ=01,s

My paycheck has a line called =01&other deductions=018, what does that stan=

There is a fixed amount of lines to print deductions on the paycheck.  For=
=20
some employees, the number of deductions are more than we have room to=20
print.  In this circumstance, the system totals all remaining deductions an=
d=20

f all=20
deductions can be viewed on the pay advice that is displayed on the intrane=
t=20

What do the earnings or deduction codes on my paycheck mean?
These definitions are listed on the Payroll webpage located at=20
hrweb.enron.com, select Enron Payroll  from the side index.

Why is my overtime not reflected on my paycheck?
Overtime is paid one pay period in arrears, therefore it will be reflected =

For year 2000 the limit is $4,724.40 on a wage base of $76,200. This limit =
is=20

another Enron company these limits will start over, however, the total amou=
nt=20
withheld across all companies will be reflected on your paystub. Excess FIC=
A=20
will be credited to you by the IRS via your tax return.

What federal income tax rate is used for my bonus or when I exercise stock=
=20
options?

We are pleased to announce that as of Monday, Sept. 18, the new version of 
EnronOnline will be launched to all our customers. 

When our customers log in on this day, they will be given the option to 
upgrade to the new version. They can choose to immediately upgrade, or to 
upgrade at a later time.

If the customers choose to upgrade, they will be taken through the same steps 
as when you upgraded. If the customers choose not to upgrade, they will 
receive a version of EnronOnline which is the same as the "old" version, but 
the colors will be blue, instead of black.

Customers who choose not to immediately upgrade can can do so at a later time 
by pressing the "Upgrade to Version 2" button in the top left corner of their 
screen.

Some customers may have browser or firewall restrictions which could cause 
difficulties in upgrading to the new version of EnronOnline. We have 
EnronOnline Help Desk and IT troubleshooters standing by to help anyone in 
this situation. For assistance, please direct calls to:

   North America 713 853 4357
   Europe  + 44 20 7783 7783
   Australia/Asia + 61 2 9229 2300

EnronOnline marketing personnel will be calling customers to help guide them 
through the new features, but it would be appreciated if you could also point 
out some of the new features when you are talking to your customers.

As of Monday, all internal users should also use the usual 
www.enrononline.com to get to the new version.

Thank you for your assistance in making EnronOnline a success.

Dave

This has not been a good day for me but I do want to thank each of you for 
all of the help you have given me during the last 7 months. Also, the great 
times we've had working and laughing together. Now for the bad or good news, 
the 24th of Jan will be my last day as I have excepted a new position at BP 
AMOCO.  It is with great pleasure knowing that I did beat Mark McCoy over 
there. Thanks again and we will still be friends. ej

**Clarification**

Harassment Prevention Training

This training is mandatory for all Enron employees employed since the last 
seminar was conducted  in late 1998 or early 1999.  Those who have already 
attended Enron harassment avoidance training will be offered a refresher 
course in avoiding and preventing harassment.

To contribute our personal best at ENRON, our conduct must promote respectful 
and co-operative work relationships. Workplace harassment conflicts with 
ENRON's vision and values and violates Company policy.  Harassment also can 
violate federal and state laws.  By understanding what harassment is and its 
potential harm, we can prevent it in our workplace.

During this training you will:

 Be able to recognize harassment
 Learn to take precautions against being harassed
 Learn to avoid being considered a harasser
 Know how to address a situation involving harassment
 Learn how harassment prevention is consistent with ENRON values

Please click here (  )  to sign up for the session of your choice.    If you 
have problems registering or have any questions, please call 713 853-0357.

We are pleased to announce that all employees of EWS and EES will receive 
harassment prevention training.  

The dates and times available for the sessions are:


 Friday, Feb 23; 1:00 - 2:30; 2:45 - 4:15
  Monday Mar 5; 1:00 - 2:30; 2:45 - 4:15; 4:30 - 6:00

All training sessions will be held in the LaSalle Room at the DoubleTree 
Hotel.
There is a $50 charge for each attendee in the training session.

It is becoming increasingly clear that the development of eCommerce will ha=

EnronOnLine has been an enormous success since its launch.  Since launch, w=

have completed 67,043 transactions on line, with a total dollar value of ov=
er=20
$25 billion.  EnronOnLine is now the largest eCommerce site in the world.

We believe that the competitive success of EnronOnLine is due to one very=

transactions, Enron acts as principal to provide direct liquidity to the=20
site.  We stand ready at all times, in any market conditions, to buy and se=

at the posted price.  This converts a =01&bulletin board=018 (the more typi=

competitors that can provide this capability.

We are increasingly convinced that this competitive advantage can be=20
dramatically expanded to other products and other geographies.  If we are=

Accordingly, we are initiating a major new effort to capture this=20

Initially, North America will provide primary direct support for staff=20

thought you would find the below "press release" a bit 
humorous............................everyone is always looking to bash 
#1...........and from the looks of the cc's, it has made a good loop around 
at both Reliant and the Diner.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
-----------------------
Today Enron and Hades announced a definitive energy services agreement said
to be worth an estimated $666 Trillion.
In the deal, Enron will provide both gas and electric commodities to Hades'
facilities throughout and under North America.  John D. Rockefeller, former
CEO of energy monopolist Standard Oil, is now head of Hades' energy
management division.  Said Rockefeller, "Obviously Hell has significant
heating demands.  While eternal flames are a great idea in concept, they
require vast and reliable fuel resources.  Enron was the only supplier
willing to make a deal with my boss, and, as a former monopolist, I just
like the way they do business."
A spokesperson for Enron said the two cultures were able to work easily
together during negotiations.  According to the company, "The deal fits both
companies exceptionally well.  With Hades' ability to attract and retain new
customers, we see this as a fabulous growth opportunity for millennia to
come."  According to several energy industry insiders, Hades' high heating
demand with very little need for summer air conditioning make it a very
attractive energy portfolio addition.
Hades is a multinational corporation with millions of sites worldwide and
approximately 173 quintillion customers.  The entity boasts sustained high
growth rates over the last two thousand years.
Enron is one of the world's leading energy and communications companies.
The company owns approximately $37 billion in energy and communications
assets.  Enron ranks in the top quarter of Fortune's "Best 100 Companies to
Work For if You Can Keep A Job There and Don't Mind Working 80 Hours A
Week," and is among the most respected corporations in America, as ranked by
customers with respect-us-or-get-curtailed clauses in their energy supply
contracts.

California's power crisis has generated heated debate over the last several months.  Unfortunately, this debate has generated more heat than light.  We want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.  Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on California energy issues.

What happened in California

The source of California's current problem is as straightforward as supply and demand.  California's economy grew 29 percent since 1998.  This increased the demand for electricity by 24 percent.  At the same time, regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state.  So demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added.  The result, predictably, is a shortage.  This summer, peak capacity will be about 10 percent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state.

In addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis.  First, the state's regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market.  The spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile.  The way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases long term, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.  In California, state regulation prevented this strategy.  This would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in the most volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine while the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawatt was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price.

Second, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remained in effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out.  This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesale prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt.

In short, California's problems were caused by regulation, not deregulation.  Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new generation from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices.

At the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned the state's policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, which, if adopted, would have averted the current crisis.

Enron's Role

Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than fix the problem.  Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the politicians and the media.  Here are the facts:

?	Other than a small amount of wind power, Enron is not a generator in the state of California.  Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the same market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a market maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.  We are interested only in having a market that works so that we can package products for our customers.
?	As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from the problems the states' utilities, and their customers, now face.  We protected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility.

You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on the open market.  Early reports mischaracterized this as a "turnback" of our customers to the utilities.  Here are the facts:

?	As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California market, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers directly from the utilities.  This decision reduced EES's market price risk by allowing EES to access lower utility rates.
?	EES did not terminate any customer contracts, and our customers continue to receive the financial benefits of their contract prices.
?	EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them with other energy-related products and services, including assistance in reducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times.

Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its crisis; Enron continues to sign up customers in the state; and Enron continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western power markets.  Enron's primary business is managing risk for our customers with solutions customized to meet their needs.  There has never been more demand for our products and services.

The Solution

The solution to California's crisis is also straightforward.  In summary, the state must increase supply, reduce demand, reduce reliance on the spot market and shore up the financial stability of the state's utilities.

Increasing Supply

California's process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing short of Byzantine.  Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in less than a year.  In California, it often takes 5 to 7 years.  California simply must streamline this process.  Ironically, while many of the regulations generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality, the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants, which emit 40 times as much NOx.  California can have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilities.

Reducing Demand

Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand.  They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is.  An open retail market would trigger demand responses, which would balance supply and demand at lower prices than today.  California should fully open its retail market.

Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market

In a truly deregulated market, customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term, fixed-price basis.  The state has instead left procurement in the hands of the utilities, which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market.  Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over their price risk.

Restoring the Financial Integrity of the State's Institutions

The utilities in California are not paying their bills.  This has led to greater uncertainty in the market, higher costs, and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions.  California must permit its utilities to recover their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed.

Just as important as doing these things, the state must avoid policies that, while politically attractive, do not fix the problem or even make matters worse.  Price caps have been proposed.  They don't work; have never worked; and they will not work here.  Price caps succeed only in creating shortages, which then have to be allocated among competing users.  Imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining, for example, whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Valley or Silicon Valley.  Price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse.

The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in California.  There is no reason to believe, and every reason to doubt, that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in, constructing, operating and maintaining assets.  This will also result in California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation -- which the private sector can do -- instead of education, roads and other public goods -- which the private sector cannot do.

As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about the crisis from the media, it's important for you to know this:  We at Enron will continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real solutions to the state.

Attention: Houston-based Outlook Users
The Global Messaging Team is proud to announce that beginning today, Monday July 16th, Houston-based Enron employees that have been migrated to Outlook will be able to securely access their Enron Email from anywhere on the web. This means that if you can get on to the Internet, you can access your Enron Email with Outlook Web Access (OWA) without having to dial in to Enron's network. Please note that this is not available to those users still on Lotus Notes but will be available once they are migrated to Outlook. 
Once on the Internet, type mail.enron.com in your browser address window and supply your Enron network logon credentials as username and password. For example:
Username: jdoe4
Password: ********
Once you log in, Outlook Web Access opens your Enron Email mailbox. Outlook Web Access (OWA) allows you to send and receive mail, perform calendar tasks and manage your mail and contacts, as well as access your mailbox folders. At this time, Public Folders are not accessible via OWA.  Please keep in mind that Outlook Web Access is a browser-based version of what you might use in the office, so the functionality may be slightly different and some features of Outlook 2000 may not be available at all. Additionally, OWA is only supported using Internet Explorer 5.x only and not supported with Netscape.
Outlook Web Access is the standard Email package for connecting to your Enron mail from home, whether you are using an Enron-issued home PC, an Internet connection with your personal home PC, or your ClickAtHome PC. We will not support the use of the full Outlook installation for home use.
Outlook Web Access for remote locations and European/APAC Enron sites is currently being addressed and will be available soon. At this time, OWA is only available if your mailbox resides on a Houston mail server.

If you have any questions, please call:

Resolution Center at x31411 or
	ETS Solutions Center at x54745

1. Introduction

We are planning to launch version 2.0 of EnronOnline to customers within th=
e=20
next few days.  In preparation for this launch, the new web site will be=20
released to internal users in North America on Wednesday, September 13th. =
=20
European internal users will be launched shortly after North America. =20
External customers will follow a few days later.=20

One of the purposes of the internal launch is to simulate the system load=
=20
which will be caused by the full customer launch.  Accordingly, we apprecia=
te=20
your cooperation in helping us to simulate this load by logging into=20
http://prod.enrononline.com (no www.)  This is a live web site and all trad=
es=20
are real.

New features (as per recent presentations and training sessions) include:

? Price limit orders
? Enhanced customization
? Floating windows
? Market news and quotes
? Weather maps and tables
? Industry-specific publications
? Market-specific homepages

2. Version 2.0 Launch Date
EnronOnline Version 2.0 will be launched to the public a few days after our=
=20
internal launch. We  will be using the new version internally from Wednesda=
y,=20
Sept. 13. This will provide an opportunity for you to become familiar with=
=20
using the new application in the production environment before our customer=
s=20
start to use it.

3. New Website Feature Details

Price limit orders: Customers have the ability to set up orders that=20
automatically execute as soon as the price and volume requested become=20
available. The limit orders remain open in the system until they are=20
executed, cancelled by the user, or when they expire. All pending orders wi=
ll=20
expire no later than 12 hours after being placed.

Pending Price Limit Orders will appear in a new window below the Quotes=20
screen in the website.

Product tabs: EnronOnline users can use enhanced filtering capabilities to=
=20
create separate page tabs for the products that interest them.  Users can=
=20
instantly access each page tab with a click of their mouse. Sort Ordering c=
an=20
be changed by clicking on a column heading, with multiple sorts possible by=
=20
holding down the shift key while clicking.

Floating windows: Users have the ability to create multiple windows with=20
different products by right-clicking on the products in the main quotes=20
screen.

Market news: Website users can now access the latest headlines, sports and=
=20
industry news from Reuters. Furthermore, the information categories can be=
=20
customized according to personal interests. To customize a particular=20
category, users need to click the Edit button in the category heading.

All information categories can be collapsed to save space. To expand or=20
collapse a category, users need to click the arrow to the left of the=20
category heading.

Stock quotes: EnronOnline now offers stock quotes (20 min. delay) from majo=
r=20
exchanges around the world.

Weather insights: Customers can now access weather maps and temperature dat=
a=20
for specific cities and regions.  Weather forecasts, up to six days ahead,=
=20
and temperature differentials from periodic averages are now available.

Industry publications: Website users can read a wide range of=20
industry-specific publications including Argus European Natural Gas, Argus=
=20
European Electricity, the news from NGI=01,s Daily Gas Price Index, Bandwid=
th=20
Desk, Coal Daily and more.

4. New Stack Manager Features

The Stack Manager has been updated to facilitate Price Limit Orders. You wi=
ll=20
notice that there is a new button at the top of the Stack Manager, which wi=
ll=20
open a window showing a summary of the best Price Limit Order bids and offe=
rs=20
against your managed products. You can click the "+" sign to the left of a=
=20
summary to show a list of all the Price Limit Orders which have been placed=
=20
against that product.

Under normal circumstances, the price shown on the website will be the same=
=20
as the price on your Stack Manager. However, the system will not allow you =
to=20
show a price which is better than an existing Price Limit Order. Instead, t=
he=20
system will show a price on the website equivalent to the prevailing Price=
=20
Limit Order while it is being filled. Once the appropriate Price Limit Orde=
rs=20
are filled, then the website will again show your Stack Manager prices.

It is important that you complete the =01&Maximum Volume=018 field in the P=
roduct=20
Properties window and that you select "Allow Price Limit Orders". Also, mak=
e=20
sure that the price tick window in the Stack Manager=01,s =01&Product Prope=
rties=018=20
field is appropriate for the product. If you do not do this, your customers=
=20
will not be able to use Price Limit Orders for your products.


5. Your Participation
Please log in to http://prod.enrononline.com (no www.) on Wednesday. To=20
ensure EnronOnline Version 2.0 is a success, it is important that you have =

=20
customers.

Subject: Energy Operations, Gas Operations - Organizational Changes


Effective immediately the following organizational changes will take effect 
within the Energy Operations, Gas Operations team. 

Kathy Kelly will assume the role of Manager of the off-system Volume 
Management team. Kathy will be responsible for the day to day management and 
development of the Volume Management team and will also lead the effort to 
reconcile historical imbalance and accounting issues. Kathy's Logistics 
experience and strong knowledge of both the upstream and downstream processes 
will help to develop a more cohesive and responsive Energy Operations team. 
Kathy will report directly to Susan Harrison, Director Gas Operations. 

Victor LaMadrid will be promoted to the Northeast Logistics Manager and will 
handle the day to day trading interface role as well as the day to day 
management and development of the Northeast Logistics team. Victor's 
extensive knowledge of many Northeast pipes coupled with his asset management 
roles and his experience as Northeast lead will help strengthen the Northeast 
team. Victor will report directly to Bob Superty, Director Gas Logistics and 
will work closely with both East Desk Directors, Dick Jenkins and Scott Neal, 
on staffing and desk management issues. 

Beverly Beaty will assume the role of Northeast lead and will be assisting 
Victor with the day to day management of the Northeast team. Beverly has 
recently served as Transco lead and has also been involved in asset 
transactions on the East desk.  Beverly brings many years of experience to 
her new role.

In addition to the above, in an effort to balance out the overall management 
responsibilities on the East Gas Desk, the Tennessee and Columbia Gulf 
scheduling team along with Steve Gillespie will now report to the Southeast 
Manager Ed Terry. 

Please join us in congratulating Kathy, Victor and Beverly in their new roles.



Susan Harrison and Bob Superty.

NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
published : October 26, 2001
Enbridge Buys Koch's East Texas Midstream Assets for $231M 
Enbridge Energy Partners LP is buying gas gathering, treating, processing and transmission assets in East Texas from Koch Midstream Services for $230.5 million. The package includes all of the East Texas System, which gathers 400 MMcf/d for delivery into the Carthage Hub. 
Enbridge Energy Company President Dan C. Tutcher said the assets are a "natural fit" with Enbridge's existing Texas assets and will significantly expand the company's "geographic footprint" in the region as well as its energy commodity mix. "We expect the acquisition to be immediately accretive to the partnership's distributable cash flow, and excellent prospects exist for further organic growth of the East Texas System.'' 
Enbridge Partners will acquire 1,880 miles of various diameter gathering lines, 37 compressor stations, four gas treating plants with a capacity of 595 MMcf/d and three gas processing plants with a combined capacity of 375 MMcf/d. The transaction is anticipated to close in December. 
The intrastate system derives revenues from the purchase, transportation and resale of natural gas. Additionally, when natural gas liquids fractionation spreads are positive, the option exists to extract NGLs from purchased gas, thus leveraging income with incremental processing revenue, the company noted. The partnership expects that the direct commodity price exposures inherent in gas purchase and resale activities and in gas processing will be suitably mitigated through a hedging strategy. 
It forecasts gas supply available to the system will be 400-420 MMcf/d in 2002. Based on this estimate, the acquisition would contribute incremental EBITDA of between $26 million and $32 million for the year, while distributable cash flow would increase by between $0.10 and $0.15 per unit, with further improvements anticipated in 2003. The forecasts assume that acquisition financing will consist of 50% debt and 50% equity, in line with Enbridge Partners target long-term capital structure. 
Enbridge Partners also reported third quarter net income of $6.6 million, or $0.13 per common unit, compared with net income of $14.2 million, or $0.42 per unit, for the third quarter in 2000. The decline was attributed mainly to an adjustment to oil inventory due to shippers of $5.4 million. The adjustment was the result of what Enbridge said were refinements in the oil loss estimation process, as well as improvements in the accuracy of measuring oil losses while developing new software applications. 
Third quarter deliveries were 1,208 million b/d compared to 1,272 MMb/d for the same period in the prior year. The partnership expects that deliveries will increase over the remainder of the year, to average between 1.30 and 1.33 MMb/d. However, its delivery estimates for 2001 and 2002 are down from prior expectations because of lower production forecasts for conventional heavy crude oil, which stem from the current wide price differential between heavy and light crude. For 2002, growing oil sands production is anticipated to boost full-year average deliveries to between 1.35 and 1.43 MMb/d. 
"The partnership's forecast indicates that crude oil delivery volumes, which have languished for the past several quarters, will start to improve modestly in the near term with more significant increases occurring in the latter half of 2002," said Tutcher. "The major contributing factor will be increased production from the immense oil sands reserves in Western Canada. We also anticipate further successes from our acquisition strategy, which will increase earnings and diversify our sources of income. The partnership's primary objective over the next two to three years is to accelerate the growth of cash distributions to unitholders. To that end, we are confident that the acquisition of the East Texas facilities combined with some improvement in liquid hydrocarbon deliveries will position the partnership to consider a distribution increase in 2002.''

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The information provides further details about:

	-- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge;
	-- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of     three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications;
	-- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties; 
	-- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and
	-- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees.

This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.  As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.  

Restatement of Earnings

Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:

Net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include:

	-- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997
	-- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998
	-- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999 
	-- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000
	-- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001 
	-- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001
	-- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001.  

The consolidation of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.

The restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the nine-month period ending September 2001.

You can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the Form 8-K filing at <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/>.

We will continue to review our strategic, operational and financial position, and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments.

Each Business Unit Supervisor will be responsible for providing a pre-ranking to the PRC Rep.  The PRC Reps have access to the consolidated feedback for each assigned Associate and Analyst.  Please be sure that you have met with the assigned PRC Rep prior to the final Associate and Analyst meeting for your business unit.  (Your business unit HR department may choose to set up pre-ranking meetings - check with your HR representative).  The final ranking for each Analyst an Associate will be determined through a cross calibration in each of the final meetings.  In these final meetings, the Analysts and Associates will be represented by a PRC Rep from their Business Unit who should be familiar with their accomplishments.

Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

Daren, I just wanted to let you know that I submitted the churn for your 
Lucent phone last week.  They have to create a duplicate extension so that it 
can be plugged in at your desk.  I apologize for it taking so long ... it's 
the first available slot that they had.

Enron purchases billions of dollars of products through its wholly owned=20
subsidiaries and venture companies worldwide.  Historically, the Company ha=
s=20
conducted these purchases in a highly fragmented, decentralized manner=20
allowing each of the operating units the discretion to source their=20
requirements in a manner that optimizes unit performance.  Today, however,=
=20
with the implementation of SAP and the profound explosion in=20
internet/intranet-based technologies, we believe the Company should change=
=20
its direction and focus on aggregating its demand for goods and strategical=
ly=20
sourcing these requirements on a global basis.  We believe that there are=
=20
significant cash savings to be extracted by the Company and also commercial=
=20
potential for the formation of a highly profitable, business-to-business=20
e-Commerce venture.

Effective February 1, 2000, Enron will form a new Global Strategic Sourcing=
=20
unit.  This new unit will consolidate the current successful strategic=20
sourcing initiatives underway in the Gas Pipeline Group, Global Asset=20
Operations and Enron Corp.  Initially, Global Strategic Sourcing will focus=
=20
on aggregating Enron=01,s internal, joint venture and business partner dema=
nd=20
for products and services with the objective of creating a future=20
business-to-business e-Commerce venture.

It gives us great pleasure to announce that George Wasaff, Managing Directo=
r,=20
will lead this new global initiative.  George will report directly to Mike=
=20
McConnell, Chief Executive Officer for Global Technology.

George has been with Enron for fourteen years and has held many senior=20
executive positions, the most recent of which was Managing Director of ENRO=
N=20
South America's Wholesale Operations.  George was also the Interim Chief=20
Executive Officer of Elektro from July 1998 through June 1999 and Chief=20
Executive Officer of Transportadora de Gas del Sur S.A. ("TGS") from June=
=20
1995 through February 1998.  George has also held numerous commercial=20
positions including Vice President and Country Manager, Mexico for Enron=20
International and Vice President of Marketing for Transwestern Pipeline=20
Company.

Please join us in supporting this new global initiative and congratulating=
=20
George in his new role with the Company.

Eric, 

I recieved a call from a guy with Pacific Interlink (?).  He is looking to 
market LNG in Europe.  Since I have very little knowledge in this area, I 
didn't get much specific information.  But, I told him I would find someone 
for him to talk with.  His name is Sam Kovacevich.  Phone:  847-971-3369.  I 
would appreciate it if you would give Sam a call.  If you aren't the person 
he needs to talk to, please let me know.  Thanks.
