PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL:  ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION, ATTORNEY WORK 
PRODUCT

Here's an update (Matt, if any of this appears inaccurate to you, don't 
hesitate to point it out):

1.  The pending joint survey.

 (a) The joint survey has yet to be scheduled.  The reason for the delay is 
an issue concerning whether SGS's Singapore laboratory has the 
resources/competence to carry out the joint analysis.  Steve Jones, ECT's 
choice of chemist, is communicating with SGS in order to make this 
determination.  Although this has delayed scheduling the joint testing, Jones 
feels strongly that it will be most cost-effective for ECT to proceed with a 
joint analysis only after making this determination.  I (and Matt) have 
personally spoken with Jones about this and believe he understands that ECT 
is looking for the quickest, most cost-effective resolution to this dispute 
with Mitsubishi.  Because of the issue with SGS, Jones has waited until now 
to send the proposed testing program to Technichem, Mitsubishi's choice of 
surveyor/chemist  (in a previous report, I mentioned that the testing program 
had already been sent to Technichem; this now turns out not to be the case).  
By today, Jones should have sent the proposed testing program to Technichem, 
in order to get the ball rolling, and with the expectation that Technichem 
will have comments that will require time to incorporate.  

 (b) If things go well with SGS, Jones anticipates scheduling a joint 
analysis about two-three weeks from now.  Jones plan to personally attend the 
joint survey on our behalf, given the complexity of the testing methods.  
Even after that testing, Jones anticipates the possibility of further testing 
in England using highly specialized equipment to determine whether the 
apparent filterable dirt buildup was caused by a malfunction of the vessel's 
inert gas system.

2. Costs.  

 (a)  Surveyors/chemists:

 (1) Jones advises that to date, he and his firm have spent a total of about 
5.5 days at 720 pounds per day, for a total of approximately 3,960 pounds, or 
roughly $5,742 at the current USD/pounds exchange rate of $1.45/1 pound.  
Jones has subcontracted some of his work to Allen Goddard, now with ITS-Caleb 
Brett, who specializes in the type of testing at issue.  Jones estimates that 
Goddard has spent approximately one day on this matter, at a daily rate of 
600 lbs, or $870.
 
 (2)  Jones estimates that from this point until the actual joint survey 
begins, he will spend about two more days, and Goddard will spend about 
another one-half day.  This totals about 1,740 pounds, or $2,523.

 (3)   For the actual joint testing, Jones estimates that he will spend about 
twelve days straight, including transit time; Goddard would not attend, but 
would be available by telephone if Jones had a question.  Twelve days' time 
amounts to 8,640 pounds, or $12,528, not including aire fare, room and board.

 (4)  Afterwards, for the additional testing in England to determine whether 
the inert gas system caused the buildup in filterable dirt, Jones estimates 
another 2,000 pounds for the cost of the lab; he does not know at this point 
whether he would attend the entire testing procedure, which he believes could 
be 
completed in about two days.  If he attended both days, this additional 
testing in England would run to another 3,440 pounds, or $4,988.

 (b) Other experts:
 
 (1) SGS and Caleb Brett's costs to date are being compiled by Matt.  SGS 
will spend another SGD 2,000 purchasing the necessary chemicals for the joint 
testing, and bill for another SGD 2,000 for pre-joint-analysis development 
work (basically, practicing on extra samples from the PACIFIC VIRGO).  This 
comes to a total of SGD 4,000, or  about $2,325 to prepare for the joint 
analysis, based on the current reported SGD/USD exchange rate of 1.72/1.  SGS 
estimates that it will bill us for the joint analysis SGD 9,500, or about 
$5,523.

 (2) Captain Sawant of PacMarine, one of our ship operations experts, will be 
charging us SGD 25,000, or about $14,500  for work done to date, which should 
be largely concluded with the finalization of his report.  

 (3)  Captain Gregory of Noble Denton, the ship operation expert we would 
probably use for testifying, has been asked to do no work on this matter at 
this time. 

 (c) Attorneys:

 (1) David Best is out of town on vacation, but his office advises that his 
time and expenses to date amounts to approximately 8,300 pounds, or about 
$12,035.  This is subject to being adjusted up or down, once Best gets back 
in the office and has time to review the bill.  I imagine that this bill does 
not include the time incurred by a barrister that Best called for advice on 
the FGH issue.  Neither Best nor anyone from his firm will need to attend the 
joint testing.

 (2) Neale Gregson's firm, Watson, Farley, has incurred fees and expense to 
date of SGD 105,000, or about $61,000.  Matt has not yet seen an itemized 
bill for this time, but feels that while it is high, it is not unexpected, 
given the time-intensive nature of this matter.  Matt will be asking Gregson 
whether the time also includes time spent on the FGH matter.
 
 (3) My and my legal assistant's fee and expenses through today amount to 
approximately $12,500.  This also includes time spent on the FGH matter, 
although, pursuant to Alan's instructions, I am no longer spending time on 
that matter, except where necessary to keep Janice Moore apprised. 

 (d) Summary of Costs.

 In sum, no less than approximately $106,000 has been spent to date, and this 
figure will increase once I get the SGS and Caleb Brett costs to date, and 
once David Best comes back from vacation on September 11 and reviews his bill 
(although these figures probably include a heavy overlap of time spent on the 
FGH matter).  Another $5,325 will be necessary to get ready for the joint 
analysis; another $18,000 to perform the joint analysis in Singapore, and 
another approximately $5,000 to perform specialized testing in London after 
the joint analysis is done (if Steve Jones determines that such further 
testing is necessary).

3.  Recent Sale of Thailand cargo.  

 (a) You will recall that the bulk of the product from the M/V PACIFIC VIRGO 
was discharged in to shore tanks in Thailand and has not been tendered to 
FGH, given the problems with the product discharged later in the Phillipines, 
which was tendered to FGH, who rejected it.  Samples from the shore tanks in 
Thailand have recently been tested by SGS's laboratory in the U.S. and 
reportedly found on spec.  All of the Thailand product has recently been sold 
to Caltex, Singapore, for delivery September 7-9, reportedly for use in 
Caltex's refinery, which makes the risk of rejection of that product by 
Caltex very low.  

 (b) Unfortunately, Matt advises that the trader cannot give us even a 
ballpark figure for the sales price of the Thailand product until the end of 
the month, given that the price is tied to some market index.  Lacking this, 
it is difficult to estimate what total diminution in market value of the 
Elang crude ECT has sustained until then.  We were previously told that the 
product discharged in Singapore sustained a diminution in market value of 
about $288,000.  For my own purposes, based on nothing more than speculation, 
and given that the bulk of the cargo was discharged in Thailand, I am using 
the working hypothesis that ECT's total damages for diminution of market 
value of all the product discharged from the M/V PACIFIC VIRGO is in the 
range of $600,000-$750,000.  Again, this may later turn out to be very 
inaccurate.       

4.  Expert witness supplemental opinion

  At my request, Captain Sawant, our consulting expert on ship operations, 
was asked whether he believed that ECT's instructions to the ship regarding 
tank washing would have been sufficient to prevent the type of contamination 
that occurred had such instructions been properly carried out (i.e., if the 
ship had access to fresh water).  Captain Sawant has opined that he does not 
believe such instructions were sufficient to have prevented the type of 
contamination that occurred.   While we can protect Captain Sawant's opinion 
from discovery by using him only as a consulting expert, it strikes me that 
Mitsubishi will likely not overlook this issue.  Despite this, however, ECT 
still has some argument that the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act puts a 
non-delegable duty to provide a cargoworthy ship on Mitsubishi.

Richard,

FYI. Per my voice-mail of a moment ago, while I appreciate Matt having raised 
the possibility of ECT making a bad situation worse by finding a "bug", I am 
not inclined to stop the testing.  I agree with David Best's sense that if 
there is a "bug" in the product at the time it was loaded from the supplier's 
mooring facility, and if Mitsubishi or an end-user comes after ECT with a 
claim that, e.g., the "bug" contaminated the ship's later cargoes, the 
presence of  "bug" in the product would seem to give us a pretty good 
argument against the supplier, in this case, a Phillips entity.

Please also keep in mind that our testing is not just for a "bug", but also 
to see whether the possibility of the aging of the cargo may have caused the 
loadport samples to fail.

If we stop the testing now, our chances of recovering any settlement from 
Mitsubishi or the cargo underwriters are remote.  In fact, Jim Studdert just 
advised that he spoke with the local adjuster for our cargo underwriters,and 
was told, "I don't think it was an insurable claim if it was contaminated 
when it was loaded aboard the ship."  This statement was not a surprise to 
Jim or me.  

By copy of this, I wonder if Mike could send to me a copy of the general 
terms and conditions that David Best references below.

We are into the third day of testing in a series of analytical tests that
will be complete on Friday with full results available by the middle of
next week.

It is not possible at this stage to point a finger at anyone since testing
is only midway.  Matt Lee has raised a concern about carrying on testing,
particularly biological testing to be undertaken on Friday, if it is only
going to expose Enron further without any recourse against the suppliers.
Were the testing to stop now, we will have incomplete analyses with two
sets of loadport data that are in conflict.  This will make the chances of
a recovery against ship and suppliers very difficult in my view.  Jim
Studdert has offered the opinion that it would be very difficult to make a
recovery from underwriters with the results as they are at present.  Steve
Jones' inclination is to carry on to try and get a firmer view.  It may be
that the ship is still the villain of the piece because even the loadport
results that have just come out do not match the kind of filterable dirt
that is present in the discharge samples, i.e. there is an increase.
Biological contamination, if present, could also mean involvement of the
ship, particularly if the loadport results are clean or not nearly as bad
as the discharge port results.  On the other hand, if biological
contamination is shown to be present in the loadport samples at the same
kind of level as the discharge port samples, clearly the finger points
straight at the suppliers and not at underwriters and at the ship.  I think
the suppliers will have a case to answer, bearing in mind they contracted
to sell Elang blend ultralight crude oil of normal export quality at time
and place of loading.  I will be surprised if normal export quality means
that the cargo can carry "bugs".  Can someone fax to me the Enron General
Terms & Conditions applicable to crude oil, petroleum and petrochemical
transactions effective 1st January 2000 which are incorporated in the
Phillips Petroleum Contract with Enron Capital & Trade Resources Singapore?
I should like to take a look at them.

Were we to break now midway through the anlaysis, I am sure underwriters'
expert would immediately talk to his principals who will ask the obvious
question why we stopped.  To this extent, I think we shall have to carry on
to try to get nearer to the truth, or something that approaches it.

If anybody has different views and wants to stop right now, will they
please let me know immediately.

Regards,
David Best.

Hi Britt:
Greetings from Singapore.  I'm slowly getting over my jet-lag.  It's great to 
be here and I'm looking forward to the rest of my stay.  On the Pacific Virgo 
front I wanted to forward to you Paul Henking's views to get your comments.  
Also, I talked to Neale Gregson today and he is very opposed to the selection 
of Mark Hamsher as the arbitrator since in his experience Mark has been a 
maverick and is not a lawyer. Neale believes we need a Queen's Counsel as an 
arbitrator. Neale will be discussing this issue with David Best tonight.  
Thanks again for that great lunch!
Best regards,
Mike

matt/mike,

tried to call matsuru/mitsubishi this afternoon but he was in a meeting. i 
will try later and let you know if i get hold of him.

in the meantime, i do have some concerns with mitsubishi taking us to 
arbitration for the outstanding frt and demurrage we owe on the pacific 
virgo. if this goes to arbitration, i am sure we will lose and have to pay 
the amounts due. i understand a decision has to be made before the end of 
this week.

of course, going to arbitration would give us the opportunity to present our 
claim for the contamination as a counter claim. however, i feel sure the 
arbitrators will say pay the freight/demurrage now and make the claim a 
separate issue.

from below, our insurance company has been advised of the contamination claim 
and i feel this is a valid claim. obviously, we loaded one spec which was in 
order and the vessel arrived with a different spec.  however, rather than 
going to arbitration and incurring additional expenses, i feel we should be 
letting the insurance company handle this with the owner's insurance company 

granted, with the insurance companies, this could, and probably would, take 
some time (1-2 years) and we may still not get money out of it if the owners 
can prove their position. however, going to arbitration may not be any more 
successful and would be final.

in summary, i would suggest paying the outstanding freight with advices to 
mitsubishi that we will turn our attention to the demurrage claim and revert 
by the end of the month. there is a big difference in going to arb for 
$760,000 vs. only $259,000. this advice would be without prejudice to our 
contamination claim which will now increase by the amount of the freight and 
the amount of the demurrage.

at the same time, we should advise the insurance company that we have been 
unsuccessful in negotiating any settlement by offset of freight and demurrage 
and request they proceed with the contamination claim against the owners. we 
can send them the letter legal/i sent to mitsubishi outlining our claim 
mentioning that this amount will now increase due to the freight and 
demurrage costs.

you may want to discuss this with britt davies but i see no way we will win 
on the freight payment issue if this goes to arbitration.

mike,

in talking to eric, he says you have reported this claim to insurance. was 
just wondering where we stood on this matter as there are things going on 
over here.

as an update, mitsubishi is taking us to arbitration for the outstanding frt 
and demurrage which understand totals about $7-800,000. 

legal here has submitted a letter under my name claiming our damages are 
about $1.5-2.0 mil. we were trying to settle this claim but getting nowhere 
on this matter.

Matt:
I agree w/ Britt that we need to know more about what testing has been done, 
but I would think that the joint test should be conducted using the same 
method used at loadport (regardless of whether ashing is proper or not).  Not 
for the reason you mention (Mitsubishi may well argue about "proper" 
rejection, but that's not likely a viable argument, since the fact is that 
First Gas rejected the cargo and the dirt spec alone was sufficient grounds 
for that rejection), but for the sake of consistency.  It doesn't matter at 
all to First Gas what test methods were used or will be used on this cargo -- 
it's no longer any of their concern.  It's Enron's risk and sole 
responsibility to deal w/ costs following rejection -- per the contract.  I 
hope that we are not informing First Gas about anything that has happened or 
will happen on this cargo (I noticed a note from Jon Russell inquiring about 
the cargo -- I trust that we have politely refused to tell them anything).

Janice

PRODUCT

Matt,
 
Thanks for the heads-up on this issue.  I will confer with Janice and one of 
us will get back to you.  

Meanwhile, I think I may need further clarification about  what testing 
methods were used by SGS at loadport and at discharge in Thailand and the 
Phillipines.  My key area of concern is whether (as now appears unlikely from 
your e-mail) SGS tested using both ASTM D3605 without ashing and ASTM D3605 
with ashing at all the relevant points, and whether the test results were 
consistent; e.g., whether the product was on-spec for both methods 
immediately before loading, but off-spec for both methods at discharge in 
Thailand and the Phillipines.  May I impose on you to provide one summary 
chronology of the analysis done at loadport and both discharge ports, with 
particular emphasis on (a) whether both testing methods (ASTM D3605 without 
ashing and with ashing) were used, and the results, and (b) the results for 
filterable dirt? (You have just sent something like this for the Thailand 
cargo only, which I found very helpful).   Also, if SGS or anyone else has 
made comment about the reliability or unreliability of the filterable dirt 
analysis (or any other aspect of the testing done by SGS of this cargo), 
please let me know about that as well.

I appreciate your good help.

    Britt

		 Subject: D3605

Dear Janice / Britt

I know that Janice has kindly agreed to return to the team to advise and 
coordinate with Mike Brown's team and myself in regard to the D3605 issue, 
whilst I am to look to Britt's guidance for the contamination on the Elang 
cargo. My apologies therefore for mixing the issues for the puposes of this 
e-mail. 

The joint testing of samples of the Elang cargo is planned to take place end 
next week. The joint testing would include metals as well as filterable dirt, 
so we would need to decide, in quite short order, on the test method we want 
to propose for metals for relevant parties to agree.

Although we believe the contamination would be dramatically demonstrated by 
the level of filterable dirt, the metals clearly would also be an important 
factor. As you may be aware, the loadport sample results which we are 
presently relying on to say that the cargo was on spec when loaded, was 
tested with "ashing" for metals. We would not be able to say whether another 
loadport sample would test on spec for metals using straight D3605. If it 
doesn't test on spec at the joint testing using straight D3605, the vessel 
owners would surely argue that the cargo would have been rejected by First 
Gas anyway, independent of the filterable dirt. Although such as argument may 
not defeat our case entirely, it is very likely to impact on the quantum we 
would be able to recover.

It seems that the preferred test method for metals at the joint testing would 
therefore be "ashing" to avoid conflict with existing loadport sample 
results. We still have SGS's support for that, but we need to convince Minton 
Treharne who acts for the cargo underwriters as well as the Owners/P&I Club. 
Still, just in case details of our dispute with Mitsubishi become known to 
Firts Gas, we may wish to avoid proposing a test method for joint testing 
that would be inconsistent with the one we ultimately present to First Gas, 
which for obvious long term objectives ought to be the CORRECT test method 
acceptable to parties whether D3605 or "ashing" or some other method. That 
said, I think if we are able to go with "ashing" for the joint testing, it is 
not likely to jeopardize our position with First Gas. 

I note Janice's preference for US experts over European experts for the D3605 
issue. Have we been able to get any US experts' view on the right test to use 
(whether D3605 or "ashing")? Has Enron formed a view on the "correct" test 
method? If we have been able to source a "friendly" US expert, we may want to 
have his input for the contamination issue. 

Your views and guidance would be most appreciated.

Thanks and regards
Matt







I also note Janice's preference to source for US experts to assist us on the 
D3605 issue over European experts and was wondering whether we have been able

 You have ECT's authority (per John Nowlan and Alan Aronowitz) to notify 
Mitsubishi that ECT declines to pay its claim for freight and demurrage due 
to the cargo contamination that occurred aboard the ship and that ECT wishes 
to go forward with appointment of arbitrators for London arbitration.  I ask 
that David draft the appropriate document and then confer with Matt as to who 
should send this document to Mitsubishi.  No one over here needs to see it 
before you send it out.  You may wish to send a copy to Cliff Bennett as 
well.  Please send me a copy of this document by e-mail or telefax  once you 
have sent it out.

 Many thanks.

>From David Best.

Following our telephone conference this morning, the following advice can be
given.  Please treat this advice as the joint advice of myself and Counsel 
John
Lockey.  We give it in bullet form for the purposes of clarity.

1.   The terms of the ASTM D3605 do support the view that it is inappropriate 
to
apply D3605 to condensate.  The fact remains, however, that the contract 
defines
the contractual specification by reference to D3605.  On the face of it, Enron
has promised a specification in accordance with test method D3605 and has 
agreed
to assume the risk tht the condensate does not satisfy the specification when
tested in accordance with D3605.

2.   The terms of Appendix 1 to the 1997 Fuel Supply Plan seem to us to make 
it
much more difficult to argue that the reference in Appendix B of the contract 
fo
D3605 means only that D3605 applies to condensate to the extent that it is
appropriate to use D3605 for condensate.  The fact that Enron reported test
results for condensate in Appendix 1 to the 1997 Fuel Supply Plan by reference
simply to test method D3605 makes it very difficult to argue that when the
parties concluded the contract, they would have had in mind that D3605 applies
only to gasoil and would not apply (or would only apply with modifications) to
condensate.

3.   The terms of the Fuel Supply Plan,and of Appendix 1, make it even more
difficult to argue that the impossibility of finding a seller who is willing 
to
sell condensate applying test method D3605 satisfies the test of using
reasonable commercial efforts.  Even though Enron is not contractually 
committed
to the terms of the Fuel Supply Contract, the fact is that Enron put forward
typical specifications for condensate by reference to D3605.  The Fuel Supply
Plan re-emphasises the importance to the buyer of being provided with 
condensate
in preference to naptha or gasoil.

4.   Our understanding of SGS' advice to Enron is that D3605 does not envisage
ashing, and that it would be wrong to report a result by reference to test
method D3605 if the sample had been ashed before testing.

5.   Should SGS provide a test certificate certifying a specification which is
outside contractual specification applying D3605with a notation that 
condensate
falls outside the scope of D3605, (as they suggest), the buyers will still be
able to reject because any verification is final, conclusive and binding on 
the
parties, provided there is no manifest error.

6.   If it is the case that applying D3605 (without any modifications to the
ASTM methodology) to portions of the sample condensate provided to the
independent inspector would (or may well) produce different results (in ppm) 
for
the same sample because of the volatility of condensate, it seems to us to be
strongly arguable that the independent inspector (aware that his certification
of non-compliance will be binding under the contract) should simply refuse to
certify a test result by reference to D3605.  It seems to us to be difficult 
in
those circumstances for the inspector to conclude that a particular test 
result
is reliable.  (Furthermore, if it is the case that it is not practically
possible to certify quantities of elements below 0.5ppm using D3605 on
condensate, then again the independent inspector should refuse to certify at
those levels).

7.   If the independent inspector refuses to certify by reference to D3605, 
the
buyer will have to decide whether to reject and take his chances of
demonstrating that in fact the condensate was off-spec by reference to D3605.
(The absence of a certificate of compliance with specification does not seem 
to
us to justify rejection).  If the buyer decides to reject, an arbitrator would
have to decide on all the evidence whether the cargo was off-spec as measured 
by
D3605.  The buyer would be running the risk that he could not justify the
rejection, with a potential exposure to Enron's costs.  It would be prudent in
those circumstances for Enron to have commissioned a number of tests using 
D3605
methodology in order to present an average (and hopefully on-spec) result to
counteract the test results produced by the buyer.  It would also be prudent 
in
those circumstances for Enron to have commissioned a number of tests using 
SGS'
preferred method of testing condensate, as these results could be used by 
Enron
to require the buyer to take a rejected cargo in mitigation of the buyer's 
loss
or to submit to the arbitrators that the buyer should have mitigated by
accepting re-tender of the rejected cargo when accompanied by an independent
inspector's certification that the specs were met by reference to the much 
more
appropriate methods for testing.

8.   Contractually, it is almost certainly not open to Enron to refuse to 
agree
on the appointment of an independent inspector, or to insist that the
independent inspector should not test the sample of condensate using method
D3605 unless there are modifications to that method when applied to 
condensate.
However, there does not appear to be any objection to Enron advising in 
advance
that because the independent inspector's certificate is intended to be binding
under the contract, the independent inspector should not provide a result by
reference to D3605 unless satisfied that that result is truly representative 
of
the qualities of the sample.

9.   Turning to Enron's exposure to a tax liability on the nomination and
shipment of gasoil we repeat our advice given in our e mail of 2nd August that
it is not possible for Enron to argue with any realistic prospect of success
that the apparent impossibility of finding a seller who is willing to sell
condensate applying test method D3605 satisfies the test of using reasonable
commercial efforts to justify zero tax.  It seems to us that this provision is
designed to deal with problems of obtaining condensate cargoes due to force
majeure related reasons after the contract has been entered into.  The onus is
on Enron to demonstrate that it has used reasonable commercial efforts.  It is
likely in our view that FGCP will set off against price a sum equivalent to 
the
tax liability so that Enron is out of pocket with the regard to the nominated
gasoil.

10.  Unless Enron wishes to manage the contract by risking a rejection dispute
each time condensate is delivered (assuming SGS do not certify) Enron may want
try to renegotiate the contract.  It may be that the point we have raised in 7
concerning the risk of an unlawful rejection by the buyer may be helpful in 
any
such renegotiation.

Thanks for the great summary. Just a couple of minor points of clarification :

3(a) With regards to the FGH contract specs, samples from Thai shore tanks 
tested recently by SGS Houston tested on spec for metals and filterable dirt, 
but off spec for Ramsbottom Carbon Residue. Please note however, that the 
sale to Caltex Singapore was not sold on FGH contract specs, but "normal 
export quality" (ie. without specs). Rejection is therefore highly unlikely.

3(b) The cargo on the Pacific Virgo was sold and discharged in Korea, not 
Singapore.

Matt

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL:  ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION, ATTORNEY WORK 
PRODUCT

Here's an update (Matt, if any of this appears inaccurate to you, don't 
hesitate to point it out):

1.  The pending joint survey.

 (a) The joint survey has yet to be scheduled.  The reason for the delay is 
an issue concerning whether SGS's Singapore laboratory has the 
resources/competence to carry out the joint analysis.  Steve Jones, ECT's 
choice of chemist, is communicating with SGS in order to make this 
determination.  Although this has delayed scheduling the joint testing, Jones 
feels strongly that it will be most cost-effective for ECT to proceed with a 
joint analysis only after making this determination.  I (and Matt) have 
personally spoken with Jones about this and believe he understands that ECT 
is looking for the quickest, most cost-effective resolution to this dispute 
with Mitsubishi.  Because of the issue with SGS, Jones has waited until now 
to send the proposed testing program to Technichem, Mitsubishi's choice of 
surveyor/chemist  (in a previous report, I mentioned that the testing program 
had already been sent to Technichem; this now turns out not to be the case).  
By today, Jones should have sent the proposed testing program to Technichem, 
in order to get the ball rolling, and with the expectation that Technichem 
will have comments that will require time to incorporate.  

 (b) If things go well with SGS, Jones anticipates scheduling a joint 
analysis about two-three weeks from now.  Jones plan to personally attend the 
joint survey on our behalf, given the complexity of the testing methods.  
Even after that testing, Jones anticipates the possibility of further testing 
in England using highly specialized equipment to determine whether the 
apparent filterable dirt buildup was caused by a malfunction of the vessel's 
inert gas system.

2. Costs.  

 (a)  Surveyors/chemists:

 (1) Jones advises that to date, he and his firm have spent a total of about 
5.5 days at 720 pounds per day, for a total of approximately 3,960 pounds, or 
roughly $5,742 at the current USD/pounds exchange rate of $1.45/1 pound.  
Jones has subcontracted some of his work to Allen Goddard, now with ITS-Caleb 
Brett, who specializes in the type of testing at issue.  Jones estimates that 
Goddard has spent approximately one day on this matter, at a daily rate of 
600 lbs, or $870.
 
 (2)  Jones estimates that from this point until the actual joint survey 
begins, he will spend about two more days, and Goddard will spend about 
another one-half day.  This totals about 1,740 pounds, or $2,523.

 (3)   For the actual joint testing, Jones estimates that he will spend about 
twelve days straight, including transit time; Goddard would not attend, but 
would be available by telephone if Jones had a question.  Twelve days' time 
amounts to 8,640 pounds, or $12,528, not including aire fare, room and board.

 (4)  Afterwards, for the additional testing in England to determine whether 
the inert gas system caused the buildup in filterable dirt, Jones estimates 
another 2,000 pounds for the cost of the lab; he does not know at this point 
whether he would attend the entire testing procedure, which he believes could 
be 
completed in about two days.  If he attended both days, this additional 
testing in England would run to another 3,440 pounds, or $4,988.

 (b) Other experts:
 
 (1) SGS and Caleb Brett's costs to date are being compiled by Matt.  SGS 
will spend another SGD 2,000 purchasing the necessary chemicals for the joint 
testing, and bill for another SGD 2,000 for pre-joint-analysis development 
work (basically, practicing on extra samples from the PACIFIC VIRGO).  This 
comes to a total of SGD 4,000, or  about $2,325 to prepare for the joint 
analysis, based on the current reported SGD/USD exchange rate of 1.72/1.  SGS 
estimates that it will bill us for the joint analysis SGD 9,500, or about 
$5,523.

 (2) Captain Sawant of PacMarine, one of our ship operations experts, will be 
charging us SGD 25,000, or about $14,500  for work done to date, which should 
be largely concluded with the finalization of his report.  

 (3)  Captain Gregory of Noble Denton, the ship operation expert we would 
probably use for testifying, has been asked to do no work on this matter at 
this time. 

 (c) Attorneys:

 (1) David Best is out of town on vacation, but his office advises that his 
time and expenses to date amounts to approximately 8,300 pounds, or about 
$12,035.  This is subject to being adjusted up or down, once Best gets back 
in the office and has time to review the bill.  I imagine that this bill does 
not include the time incurred by a barrister that Best called for advice on 
the FGH issue.  Neither Best nor anyone from his firm will need to attend the 
joint testing.

 (2) Neale Gregson's firm, Watson, Farley, has incurred fees and expense to 
date of SGD 105,000, or about $61,000.  Matt has not yet seen an itemized 
bill for this time, but feels that while it is high, it is not unexpected, 
given the time-intensive nature of this matter.  Matt will be asking Gregson 
whether the time also includes time spent on the FGH matter.
 
 (3) My and my legal assistant's fee and expenses through today amount to 
approximately $12,500.  This also includes time spent on the FGH matter, 
although, pursuant to Alan's instructions, I am no longer spending time on 
that matter, except where necessary to keep Janice Moore apprised. 

 (d) Summary of Costs.

 In sum, no less than approximately $106,000 has been spent to date, and this 
figure will increase once I get the SGS and Caleb Brett costs to date, and 
once David Best comes back from vacation on September 11 and reviews his bill 
(although these figures probably include a heavy overlap of time spent on the 
FGH matter).  Another $5,325 will be necessary to get ready for the joint 
analysis; another $18,000 to perform the joint analysis in Singapore, and 
another approximately $5,000 to perform specialized testing in London after 
the joint analysis is done (if Steve Jones determines that such further 
testing is necessary).

3.  Recent Sale of Thailand cargo.  

 (a) You will recall that the bulk of the product from the M/V PACIFIC VIRGO 
was discharged in to shore tanks in Thailand and has not been tendered to 
FGH, given the problems with the product discharged later in the Phillipines, 
which was tendered to FGH, who rejected it.  Samples from the shore tanks in 
Thailand have recently been tested by SGS's laboratory in the U.S. and 
reportedly found on spec.  All of the Thailand product has recently been sold 
to Caltex, Singapore, for delivery September 7-9, reportedly for use in 
Caltex's refinery, which makes the risk of rejection of that product by 
Caltex very low.  

 (b) Unfortunately, Matt advises that the trader cannot give us even a 
ballpark figure for the sales price of the Thailand product until the end of 
the month, given that the price is tied to some market index.  Lacking this, 
it is difficult to estimate what total diminution in market value of the 
Elang crude ECT has sustained until then.  We were previously told that the 
product discharged in Singapore sustained a diminution in market value of 
about $288,000.  For my own purposes, based on nothing more than speculation, 
and given that the bulk of the cargo was discharged in Thailand, I am using 
the working hypothesis that ECT's total damages for diminution of market 
value of all the product discharged from the M/V PACIFIC VIRGO is in the 
range of $600,000-$750,000.  Again, this may later turn out to be very 
inaccurate.       

4.  Expert witness supplemental opinion

  At my request, Captain Sawant, our consulting expert on ship operations, 
was asked whether he believed that ECT's instructions to the ship regarding 
tank washing would have been sufficient to prevent the type of contamination 
that occurred had such instructions been properly carried out (i.e., if the 
ship had access to fresh water).  Captain Sawant has opined that he does not 
believe such instructions were sufficient to have prevented the type of 
contamination that occurred.   While we can protect Captain Sawant's opinion 
from discovery by using him only as a consulting expert, it strikes me that 
Mitsubishi will likely not overlook this issue.  Despite this, however, ECT 
still has some argument that the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act puts a 
non-delegable duty to provide a cargoworthy ship on Mitsubishi.

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL: ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION, ATTORNEY WORK 
PRODUCT


 Here's an update.  I have included Janice because of the overlap of some of 
the items:

1.  David Best is working on a very short draft reply to Mitsubishi's 
recently-received position in this matter, and will speak with Matt re the 
wording before requesting authority to send it out.  I will circulate it to 
you for your approval once I see the final draft.

2.  We still have not been advised by Mitsubishi who their lawyer or chemist 
will be in this matter.  We know that Mitsubishi recently tried to retain 
Tony Rooth of Watson, Farland, who was conflicted out because of the role of 
Watson, Farland's Singapore office in this matter.  We expect that the delay 
is attributable to the internal procedures at Mitsubishi that come into play 
when retaining outside representatives.

3.  Although the joint survey is tentatively scheduled for the week of August 
21-25, that may slide, given that ECT's chemist, Steve Jones, and the cargo 
underwriters' chemist, Cliff Bennett of Minton's, have not finalized the 
testing program that they will jointly submit to whoever Mitsubishi appoints 
as its surveyor. I agree with David that it is critical to (a) get the 
program right  and (b) make sure the lab (and lab technician) is capable of 
handling this testing.  The results of the joint survey will obviously have a 
significant impact on this case.

4.  Best anticipates that Steve Jones and Cliff Bennett will ultimately 
recommend that ASTM D 3605 with and without ashing be used (I have previously 
reported this).

5. In response to Matt's question about which testing method will prevail, I 
agree with David that from the standpoint of resolution of the cargo 
contamination case, we will not be in a position to determine this until 
after the testing is done and the results analyzed.

6. I have spoken with Best about Janice's comments to me about the risk of 
the substantial e-mail traffic in this case leading to inadvertent disclosure 
of otherwise privileged material.  We are both very open to communicating 
strictly by telefax or letter (or memo, with respect to my communications to 
each of you), if that does not impose an undue burden on anyone else.  Janice 
and Matt, would you let me know what thoughts/concerns  you have about this 
concept and/or how to implement it?

7. Janice has also mentioned that in resolving the cargo contamination 
matter, we need to be mindful of the confidentiality provisions of the FGH 
contract.  It strikes me that we will need to introduce some evidence of our 
contractual obligations to FGH and at least a specific description of the 
accompanying specifications in arbitration in order to recover.  Under London 
arbitration, documents that are received in the course of discovery are 
reportedly always treated as confidential and may not be disclosed without 
the consent of the party who produces the document.  Janice, I'll give you a 
call to discuss whether production by ECT to Mitsubishi of the terms of the 
FGH agreement under these circumstances runs afoul of the confidentiality 
provision.   

I welcome your comments and will continue to keep you advised.

       Britt

Subject: In re M/V PACIFIC VIRGO

 PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL;  ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION, ATTORNEY WORK 
PRODUCT

 Matt, it was a pleasure speaking with you this evening (your time).  As I 
mentioned, I have some follow-up fact questions that I would appreciate your 
help with, when you have a moment.  Some of these questions probably require 
the attention of experts (e.g., #s 3 and 4), so feel free to decline to 
answer where the question appears outside your "jurisdiction."  Please do not 
call anyone outside of Enron to get answers at this point; also, to the 
extent that you need to ask Enron employees for answers, I would prefer your 
asking them questions and writing down the answers to be kept in your 
investigation file, rather sending them this e-mail and getting e-mail 
responses.



 1.  A chronology sent by you as an attachment to your letter of July 14 to 
Mike Robison reflects that on 4 November 1999, a sample of "Elang Condensate" 
was taken by SGS Redwood Singapore.  Apparently, the "Filterable Dirt" was 
off spec (7.1, versus a max of 4.0).  With regard to this sampling,

 (a) Did Enron request it? YES If so, who requested it, JOHN CHISMAR/ERIC 
TANand for what purpose?PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT OF SUITABILITY OF ELANG 
CONDENSATE BEFORE PURCHASE. 

 (b) Was the sample taken from one of the shore tanks from which the cargo at 
issue was loaded?  If not, from what location was the sample    obtained? 
SAMPLE WAS TAKEN FROM A FLOATING FACILITY (NOT SHORETANK). UNCLEAR WHETHER 
FROM SAME TANK AS LOADED CARGO. LOADED CARGO LIKELY TO HAVE COME FROM A FEW 
TANKS. 

 (c) Did the testing reveal that anything else that has us concerned about 
the present cargo, such as the presence of metals? NO

 (d) Did Enron do any follow-up with Phillips, who I understand was the 
supplier, about the off-spec dirt or anything else that was discovered during 
the  sampling?  If so, please give the particulars as to who was involved, 
what was said, and what the result was. NOT SURE IF JOHN CHISMAR SPOKE WITH 
PHILLIPS BUT NOTE THAT CARGO WAS NOT BOUGHT WITH GUARANTEED FGH TYPE SPECS 
BUT "NORMAL EXPORT QUALITY AT THE TIME AND PLACE OF LOADING" 

 (e) Has the sample been retained? NOVEMBER SAMPLE ALL USED UP AT TESTING

 2. Did Enron discuss with the supplier 

 (a)the proposed end use of this product 

 (b) its fitness for that end use and/or

 (c) the contract specs that Enron had to meet to satisfy FGH?  If not, why 
not? JOHN CHISMAR'S INPUT REQUIRED
 
 3. Another chronology prepared by you mentions that a loadport analysis was 
performed by SGS on 27 June and that our cargo met the FGH   contract specs 
(I assume, in all regards) YES ("ASHING" METHOD USED).  Do we still have that 
sample available for retesting, and will a restest of it be included in the 
current round of testing? THE SAMPLES WERE DRAWN AT LOADPORT FROM AN 
AUTOSAMPLER. 3X1L SAMPLES WERE USED UP AT THE 27 JUNE TEST. WE PRESENTLY HAVE 
A 1X5L LOADPORT SAMPLE FROM THE AUTOSAMPLER IN SINGAPORE RESERVED FOR JOINT 
TESTING AND ANALYSIS IN SINGAPORE. THERE IS ALSO ANOTHER 1X5L LOADPORT SAMPLE 
FROM THE AUTOSAMPLER IN OWNERS/P&I CLUB POSSESSION WHICH WE HAVE ASKED TO BE 
SURRENDERED TO US TO BE DELIVERED TO SINGAPORE WHERE ALL SAMPLES ARE BEING 
COLLATED FOR JOINT TESTING AND ANALYSIS.

 4.  Why is this product called "Elang Crude" when it is in reality 
reportedly condensate? CARGO CALLED "CRUDE" BY SUPPLIER APPARENTLY BECAUSE OF 
EXPORT REASONS (HAVE TO CHECK WITH JOHN CHISMAR). UNDERSTAND FROM SPEAKING 
WITH PACMARINE THAT AN "ULTRALIGHT CRUDE" LIKE ELANG CAN GENERALLY BE 
REFERRED TO AS "CONDENSATE" BUT THERE IS NO REAL BENCHMARK AS TO HOW LIGHT A 
CRUDE MUST BE BEFORE IT CAN RIGHTLY BE REGARDED AS CONDENSATE.

 5.  What is the meaning of the term "export grade"?  Are there various other 
gradations?  If so, what do those mean? JOHN CHISMAR'S INPUT REQUIRED.

 6. Has Enron ever purchased Elang Crude from this supplier previously?  NO 
Ever heard of any prior problems with Elang Crude from this supplier? NO. 
NOTE THAT CONDENSATE IS TYPICALLY DELIVERED TO REFINERIES (NOT POWER PLANTS) 
THAT ARE NOT TOO CONCERNED WITH DETAILED SPECS

 7. Has Enron ever chartered the PACIFIC VIRGO in the past to transport Elang 
Crude? NOIf so, please give a thumbnail description of the voyages.  If not, 
have we ever chartered the PACIFIC VIRGO at all?NO

 8.  Prior to this voyage, have our operations folks ever chartered any 
vessel to transport a cargo of Elang Crude?NO. HOWEVER, WE MADE 2 DELIVERIES 
OF SENIPAH CONDENSATE (FROM INDONESIA - ONE IN FEB 00 AND ANOTHER IN MAY 00) 
UNDER THE FGH CONTRACT If so, please give a thumbnail description of the 
voyages, including 
 
 (a) whether the tanks were Butterworthed, SENIPAH CARGO - NOT BUTTERWORTHED 
BUT INSTRUCTIONS WERE GIVEN TO TANK CLEAN PRIMARILY BECAUSE LAST CARGOES WERE 
CARBON BLACK FEEDSTOCK (MAY) AND FUELOIL (FEB). TANK CLEANING INSTRUCTIONS 
INCLUDED WASHING AND FLUSHING TANKS, PIPES AND PUMPS and if so, whether Enron 
had to pay extra; WE DID NOT HAVE TO PAY EXTRA ON BOTH OCCASIONS. IT IS ONLY 
IN THE C/P OF PACIFIC VIRGO THAT WE AGREED TO BEAR COSTS FOR CLEANING.

 (b) whether the end use of the Elang Crude was similar to the end use of the 
cargo here, BOTH SENIPAH CONDENSATE CARGOES WERE FOR FGH and

 (c)  whether there were any contamination problems/concerns. NO. NOTE 
HOWEVER THAT "ASHING" METHOD WAS USED BY SGS ON BOTH FEB AND MAY SENIPAH 
CARGOES
 
 9.  Who were the Enron ops personnel who negotiated the Butterrworth issue 
with the owners? ERIC TAN  If there are written documents memorializing this, 
including letters, telexes, telefaxes, e-mails, taped or recorded telephone 
messages, calendar entries, or diary entries, they need to be preserved.  I 
wonder if I could put you in charge of making sure that all files relevant to 
this voyage generally are carefully preserved for possible use as evidence 
later on.  One thing we don't want to happen is to face a (spurious) charge 
of spoliation of evidence because an allegedly important document or memo 
from our files is inadvertantly lost or destroyed.

 10.  The Watson, Farley letter opinion of 13 July notes that the B/L 
identified the actual owners as the carriers, rather than Mitsubishi, who I 
understand was probably a time-charterer. THE BROKER HAS CONFIRMED MITSUBISHI 
CORP TO BE THE TIME CHARTERER  The copies of the B/L that I have seen, 
however, reflect a blank space in the form underneath the word "CARRIER".  Do 
you have access to a B/L that mentions the name of the actual owner? NO 
Perhaps Watson, Farley meant that because Barwil Agencies signed on behalf of 
the master, that the true owner was bound, although I am just guessing. MY 
UNDERSTANDING IS THE SAME

 11.  The PacMarine report dated 7 July 2000 ascribes the cause of the 
contamination to (a) accumulation of excessive sediments in the ship's cargo 
tanks, especially clinkage and  (b) the cleansing properties of condensate.  
Although the author refrains from squarely linking the excessive sediments to 
prior inadequate tank cleaning, he clearly leans in that direction.  On the 
other hand, it is not clear from the report whether adequate tank cleaning 
under the circumstances required Butterworthing.  I SPOKE WITH PACMARINE 
(CAPT. SAWANT). HIS OPINION IS THAT BUTTERWORTHING OR USING THE VESSEL'S ON 
BOARD EQUIPMENT TO RINSE AND FLUSH TANKS, PIPES AND PUMPS WITH FRESHWATER 
WOULD HAVE BEEN ADEQUATE CLEANING

 (a) Were our ops people aware of the prior cargoes WE WERE AWARE OF THE LAST 
3 CARGOESand the methods used to clean the tanks WE WERE AWARE THAT NO TANK 
CLEANING WAS DONE PRIOR TO LOADING THE LAST CARGO and/or the cleansing 
property of condensates YES, BUT THE ASSUMPTION MADE WAS THE PREVIOUS CARGO 
OF COSSACK CRUDE WITH SIMILAR PROPERTIES WOULD HAVE "CLEANED" THE TANK AND 
THE VESSEL BEING YOUNG WOULD NOT HAVE A LOT OF CLINKAGE (I get the impression 
from your "Issue for Consideration" that the answer to the prior cargoes part 
of this question is "yes)."? 

 (b) Was it within the scope of SGS's duties to advise Enron of the foregoing 
NO. I WOULD NEED EXPERT SUPPORT ON WHETHER IT IS OWNER OR CHARTERER'S DUTY TO 
KNOW SUITABLE TANK CLEANING METHOD , or were they only supposed to issue a 
Dry Certificate?  

 (c) Did we have anyone else attend the ship at loading on our behalf besides 
SGS? NO

 I know this covers a lot of information; none of it is urgent.  Next week 
will be fine for a response.  Many thanks for your help.

        B.K.D.

Suggest the following:

"We wish to respond to your fax messages of 11th August with regard to your
claims for freight and demurrage.

We note you have elected to refer both claims to arbitration.  Please note 
that
we have earlier elected for arbitration also in respect of our claims.

We repeat our earlier message of 7th August that you review your entitlement 
to
freight and demurrage after the joint testing of samples currently being
assembled in Singapore.  We shall also be reviewing our claim after the joint
testing.  Please note that we have already paid freight for the voyage to
Betangus in keeping with the intention we expressed to you in our fax of 13th
July which we note you attached to your recent demand.  This was paid as a
gesture of goodwill despite the evidence of contamination at the time.  We 
take
the view that it is reasonable to hold back any further payments and review 
your
claims when the joint analysis results are known to all interested parties.

On the subject of the joint analysis, kindly confirm the name of your 
technical
representative who will be attending at the laboratory of SGS Singapore when 
the
analysis is likely to take place.  Our technical representatives are 
preparing a
test programme and this will be sent to your appointed representative with an
invitation to agree".

I have put in the last paragraph assuming Mitsubishi has not nominated anyone
yet.

 Matt advised me today that John Nowlan and John Chismar have decided that 
they want to try to settle this case before the joint survey takes place and 
that they will likely appoint Paul Henking, their new head chartering person 
in Singapore (formerly of Enron's Houston office) to contact Mitsubishi about 
this.

A.  A number of new developments may have influenced this decision (although 
I would rely on Matt's knowledge about this, as he actually spoke with Nowlan 
and Chismar):

1.  SGS's Singapore lab  continues to struggle with trying to implement the 
joint survey test program that Steve Jones, our chemist, wants to use.  In 
order to determine if SGS is up to it, Jones feels that it will be necessary 
to send Alan Goddard (another one of our experts) to SGS's Singapore lab and 
assist in the trials, at an additional cost of about $7,250.  Goodard can't 
leave for another ten days or so, causing further delay.  Goodard may or may 
not conclude at the end of his stay that SGS is up to it.  ECT's other 
options are clearly second choices in terms of cost and strategy.

2.  ECT's damages now appear to be harder to prove.  As to the Elang Crude 
cargo at issue, ECT was recently able to calculate that it actually 
reportedly made over $500,000 more than if ECT had sold the cargo to FGH.  
ECT's big loss was having to substitute a naptha cargo for the Elang Crude 
that FGH had rejected.  That loss is reportedly in the range of about 
$1,300,000.  However, this seems to raise a number of issues:

(a)  Is this a recoverable consequential damage?  I haven't yet looked at the 
charter to see if there is any contractual limitation on damages.

(b)  can we prove that we in fact had to substitute naptha for condensate 
(our contract with FGH reportedly requires us to sell the naptha at a big 
discount)?  Our traders would reportedly have a tough time stating under oath 
that there was no condensate available; our key problem was lack of 
confidence what the D3605 test would show even with condensate that we 
thought was on spec.

3.  ECT has determined that it may need to recharter vessels from Mitsubishi 
in the future for strategic routes.

There may be other reasons for Nowland and Chismar's decision, and I invite 
Matt to report on anything else of which he is aware.

B.  Settlement Strategy

     Matt advises that Nowlan and Chismar want to offer to settle for a net 
payment of $250,000 by Mitsubishi to us (Matt, I would appreciate your 
helping me out with the numbers on how that figure was calculated).  I have 
told Matt in the past that I believe a drop hands agreement between ECT and 
Mitsubishi would be a very good result, and I think he and I agree.  David 
Best also agreed with a drop hands agreement when I mentioned it to him in 
the past (although he will not be aware until receipt of this e-mail of the 
recent revelation regarding the damages figures).

I will keep you advised.

Britt

Alan,
 
 This will confirm your instructions that for the time being, I will be 
reporting to you and the other above-referenced people.  I also understand 
that David Best and I will not be further involved in development of a 
resolution of the ECT/FGH agreement issues, and will confine our efforts to 
resolution of the cargo contamination matter.  Per you instructions, in order 
to keep from inundating Janice Moore (who will be working on the ECT/FGH 
agreement issues) with e-mails, I will not be reporting to her for the time 
being.

 The following are action/status items:

1. ACTION:  I would like to have your authority today for Best to retain as 
ECT's chemist in the contamination matter Steve Jones of APC Consultants, who 
is based in London.  Jones is reportedly well-regarded in the London legal 
community, makes a good witness, and has the right background for this kind 
of matter.  I am told that the best available chemist in Singapore has a 
background more oriented to fire investigation cases.  Jones charges a daily 
rate of 725-755 pounds per day, which David relates is very reasonable for 
his services.  

 Best will be sending Jones relevant documentation to review at the opening 
of business tomorrow in London, with the plan of then getting Jones' 
preliminary advice on Wednesday, including the critical element of the 
testing procedure to be used at the joint analysis that is being scheduled 
for Singapore next week.  If it proves to be our best strategy to have Jones 
attend the joint analysis in Singapore, Jones will undoubtedly be charging 
transit time in addition to his expenses. 

 I think that this case may boil down to a "battle of the experts" and that 
it is important to have our "first team" in place before the joint analysis, 
whose results may critically affect our case.

2. STATUS:  On a related matter, we are still in the process of determining 
what damages ECT has sustained in this cargo contamination case over and 
above the approximately $300,000 diminution in value sustained with respect 
to the product that was discharged in the Phillipines.  As you know, the bulk 
of the product had earlier been discharged in Thailand, where it remains in 
storage.  That product had not been nominated by FGH at the time of 
discharge, but I believe it was the case that it was supposed to meet FGH's 
specs in case FGH wanted to nominate it (Matt, please correct me if I am 
wrong).  I believe that ECT's traders are still trying to arrange for the 
disposition of that cargo.  I would not be surprised if ECT's contamination 
claim approximately doubled once the Thailand cargo is ultimately disposed 
of, although at this point I am really just speculating.

3. STATUS:  Matt asked Best what he thought the approximate cost would be to 
ECT of arbitrating this cargo contamination case.  Based on an arbitration 
that Best thought would last at least one week, and not including any 
pre-arbitration  development, Best gave a rough, preliminary estimate of 
125,000 pounds.  Best mentioned that if ECT won (which means that ECT both 
recovered on its cargo contamination claim and was found ultimately not to 
owe any unpaid freight or demurrage), ECT would likely be awarded 
approximately 2/3's of his fees, and a larger share of his expenses (such as 
the barrister's fees, the fees of our surveyor's, etc.).  

4. STATUS:  the statement of Eric Tan and a colleague involved in discussions 
with Mitsubishi regarding tank washing will be taken by us shortly.

 I will continue to keep you closely advised.  Please don't hesitate to call 
if you have any instructions.

 I may have sent this to you earlier, and if so, I apologize.  These are 
David Best's recommendations regarding ECT's position statement to 
Mitsubishi.  Please note his comments (in the second paragraph) regarding the 
wording in the second charter party and its effect on Mitsubishi's demurrage 
claim.  This position statement has not yet been sent out, pending completion 
of my internal Mitsubishi due diligence.  The only person I am still waiting 
on for comment is Walt Zimmerman of EOTT, and I expect to hear from him today.

Suggest you send the following to the owners:

"As owners are aware, Enron has suffered considerable loss and damage arising
from the contamination of condensate loaded in good order and condition but
delivered contaminated.

It is clear that Mitsubishi, as time chartered owners, would not be now 
claiming
freight or demurrage but for the contamination. There can be no argument about
this.  Since Enron is holding Mitsubishi fully liable for the contamination
according to the terms and conditions of the relevant charterparty, Enron 
takes
the view that it does not have a liability to pay either the freight or
demurrage.  Should Mitsubishi disagree, Enron suggests that all disputes are
referred to arbitration pursuant to the relevant clause of C/P.  Enron will
almost certainly be commencing arbitration once the joint analysis results are
known in order to recover their losses which have not yet been fully 
quantified.
We respectfully suggest that Mitsubishi reviews its entitlement to freight and
demurrage after the joint testing".


I have since looked at the charterparty for the second leg sent to me 
yesterday.
It is quite clear that we freely agreed to enter into an extended C/P for the
second voyage on 19 July having agreed firstly to pay freight for the first
voyage (which has now been done) and secondly to pay estimated demurrage on 
the
first voyage to be paid "by charterers as quickly as possible against owners'
provisional invoice, also actual demurrage amount to be settled by charterers 
as
soon as possible".

In my view, therefore, we cannot succesfully resist an application for an
interim award both for freight and demurrage.  We can counterclaim back 
damages
for paid freight and demurrage assuming we are successful at a later stage in
proving breach by Mitsubishi of the Charterparty concerning the contaminated
cargo.

Please confirm that the cargo owner and charterer are one and the same, i.e.
Enron Capital & Trade Resources Singapore Pte Limited.  This appears to be the
case since the charterers are ECTRS and I note the manuscript entry on the 
first
page of the liquid fuel purchase contract recording an assignment of the
contract from Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp to ECTRS.

Regards


David Best

Hi Britt

A quick update:

1. Joint testing is being planned for the end of next week (16, 17 or 18 
August). Please confirm that David Best's recommendation of Steve Jones of 
APC Petroleum (UK) is acceptable to you. I understand Steve Jones will be 
available from tomorrow and, if retained, should be briefed ASAP for his trip 
to Singapore for the joint testing.

2. David  had directed that Neale Gregson take a statement from Eric Tan. 
Neale and I have since attended with Eric and a statement is being prepared. 
PacMarine is also preparing their second/supplementary report. I hope to have 
both Eric's statement and PacMarine's report up to David by the end of the 
week for him to give his final opinion on the merits. 

3.  We have today sent to Mitsubishi the statement drafted by David. 

Best regards
Matt

David,

 This will summarize our telephone conference of today's date.  I understand 
that you had an extensive and interesting conference with Matt and Neale 
Gregson of Watson, Farley's Singapore office.  While you are still wading 
through a great deal of new information, I understand your preliminary views 
to be as follows (subject to your further review):
 
 1.  You feel comfortable with using Captain Richard Gregory of Noble, 
Denton's Singapore office as one of ECT's experts, so long as he does the 
work himself.  You are going to do some additional investigation  with Neale 
of  Dr. Eric Mullen of Burgoyne's, who would be acting as ECT's chemist, 
given that his background may primarily be in fire investigation.  If you 
decide to use someone other than Dr. Mullen, please give me your 
recommendation as soon as possible, so that we can make sure that our "first 
team" of experts is available to attend the joint survey/analysis.  Please 
also let me know as soon as you hear for when it will be scheduled.

 2.  You felt that our case against Mitsubishi would be very dependent on the 
exchanges between ECT and Mitsubishi regarding tank cleaning, along with 
interpretation of various charter party clauses.  While Matt will correct me 
if I am wrong, I believe that Eric Tan was ECT's "point man" on those 
negotiations.  Perhaps Matt could liaise with you to set up a joint telephone 
conference with you, Neale, Matt and Eric on the line to flange down exactly 
what Eric recalls having happened.  I do not know whether Eric was also 
involved in negotiating the charter party terms, but if he was, that makes 
him an even  more important witness.  Matt, may I leave this with you to set 
up?  

 3.   You preliminarily felt that, as Neale recently suggested, ECT may have 
a case against the ultimate owners of the vessel that may not be subject to 
the charter party terms.  This is based on the applicable B/L,, which you 
have not yet had a chance to review, but which you were told the Master 
signed on his own behalf (rather than on behalf of Mitsubishi).  If you 
recommend that ECT pursue the owners, then ECT will need to seize the vessel 
and obtain a letter of undertaking from its P&I club.  Ultimately, ECT would 
then proceed with litigation, probably in the jurisdiction where the seizure 
took place, or, if the parties agreed, by arbitration.  This would be 
separate and apart from arbitration against Mitsubishi.

 Meanwhile, I authorized you to proceed with retaining a ship tracking 
service to locate the vessel.  I await your formal recommendation as to 
whether we should seize the ship, and the particulars regarding local counsel 
and expected costs.

 4. You will send a draft statement of ECT's position to Matt to forward to 
Mitsubishi, to the effect that ECT feels it owes Mitsubishi nothing for the 
additional freight or demurrage, given that it was all caused by 
contamination of the cargo onboard the ship.  I will ask for authority for 
you to send this to Mitsubishi and revert as soon as I can.

 5.  You are reviewing the FGPC/ECT contract and surrounding circumstances 
and will provide us your views in due course.


Many thanks for your help.


      Regards,


      Britt Davis

1. I agree that it would probably be difficult to avoid using both tests for 
the reasons you set out. However, we are likely to be faced with two 
different results using the two tests. How should we decide which one is to  
prevail? 

2. I conferred with Eric. The plan is for someone from SGS Singapore to do 
the testing. I would like to suggest that our expert (ie. Steve Jones) once 
fully briefed, speaks with the relevant tester at SGS Singapore to satisfy 
himself that the lab is "1st class" and the tester sufficiently skilled.

Matt

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL: ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION, ATTORNEY WORK

Matt,

1. I'm on the same page as Janice with regard to testing, although I'd like 
to spin out my thoughts a bit.  In my view, at the end of the day, it is 
virtually inevitable that both D3605 with ashing and D3605 without ashing are 
going to be used on the critical loadport sample (and, therefore, for the 
rest of the samples as well ) at the joint analysis.  

 Mitsubishi's strategy at the joint analysis will be to get the remaining 
loadport sample to come up off-spec on retesting, for obvious reasons.  

 Prior to the joint analysis, Mitsubishi will be aware that (a) D3605 without 
ashing is in the FGH contract and that (b) ECT believes D3605 without ashing 
may have a reproducibility issue with this type of product.  Given this, if 
ECT proposes to use only D3605 with ashing (our safest bet) on the loadport 
sample at the joint analysis, Mitsubishi will smell a rat and insist on D3605 
without ashing.   The same would apply, I think, if even if ECT proposed to 
use only D3605 without ashing as its sole test at the joint analysis.  The 
more different kinds of tests Mitsubishi can forcefully argue should be run, 
the more likely it is that one of them will show the loadport sample is 
off-spec.  Mitsubishi's goal will be supported by the general practice of the 
chemists involved, who will want to rerun every test previously run in order 
to get to the bottom of this.  

 My sense is that it would be very difficult under the circumstances for ECT 
to credibly take the position that only one test or the other (D3605 with 
ashing or D3605 without ashing) should be run; in fact, in light of what I 
believe is virtually inevitable (Mitsubishi insisting on whatever test we 
don't propose), and in order to keep from appearing to be overly concerned 
about the reproducibility problem, my feeling is that we may want to go ahead 
and propose both tests to Mitsubishi (assuming that it is expected that we 
would initially propose the proper tests to Mitsubishi, and not the other way 
around).

2. Can you let us know exactly who will be doing the hands-on testing of this 
product in Singapore?  I know that we nominated SGS Singapore, but does this 
necessarily mean that someone from SGS will be doing the actual work, as 
opposed to us just using SGS's lab?  As Janice pointed out, we need to make 
absolutely sure that (a) the lab is first-class and (b) whoever performs the 
test this time is very experienced with D3605 with and without ashing.  Also, 
it is my thought that we do not want anyone from SGS there who is aware of 
the pre-sale analysis that SGS did of the Elang Crude cargo.  This latter 
point, especially, needs to be handled with great care; if there is a need to 
communicate with SGS about any of this, I would suggest that you first confer 
with David or Neal.

Many thanks for your help.

      Britt  

 Again, many thanks for your help.

Matt:
I agree w/ Britt that we need to know more about what testing has been done, 
but I would think that the joint test should be conducted using the same 
method used at loadport (regardless of whether ashing is proper or not).  Not 
for the reason you mention (Mitsubishi may well argue about "proper" 
rejection, but that's not likely a viable argument, since the fact is that 
First Gas rejected the cargo and the dirt spec alone was sufficient grounds 
for that rejection), but for the sake of consistency.  It doesn't matter at 
all to First Gas what test methods were used or will be used on this cargo -- 
it's no longer any of their concern.  It's Enron's risk and sole 
responsibility to deal w/ costs following rejection -- per the contract.  I 
hope that we are not informing First Gas about anything that has happened or 
will happen on this cargo (I noticed a note from Jon Russell inquiring about 
the cargo -- I trust that we have politely refused to tell them anything).

Janice

Matt,
 
Thanks for the heads-up on this issue.  I will confer with Janice and one of 
us will get back to you.  

Meanwhile, I think I may need further clarification about  what testing 
methods were used by SGS at loadport and at discharge in Thailand and the 
Phillipines.  My key area of concern is whether (as now appears unlikely from 
your e-mail) SGS tested using both ASTM D3605 without ashing and ASTM D3605 
with ashing at all the relevant points, and whether the test results were 
consistent; e.g., whether the product was on-spec for both methods 
immediately before loading, but off-spec for both methods at discharge in 
Thailand and the Phillipines.  May I impose on you to provide one summary 
chronology of the analysis done at loadport and both discharge ports, with 
particular emphasis on (a) whether both testing methods (ASTM D3605 without 
ashing and with ashing) were used, and the results, and (b) the results for 
filterable dirt? (You have just sent something like this for the Thailand 
cargo only, which I found very helpful).   Also, if SGS or anyone else has 
made comment about the reliability or unreliability of the filterable dirt 
analysis (or any other aspect of the testing done by SGS of this cargo), 
please let me know about that as well.

I appreciate your good help.

Dear Janice / Britt

I know that Janice has kindly agreed to return to the team to advise and 
coordinate with Mike Brown's team and myself in regard to the D3605 issue, 
whilst I am to look to Britt's guidance for the contamination on the Elang 
cargo. My apologies therefore for mixing the issues for the puposes of this 
e-mail. 

The joint testing of samples of the Elang cargo is planned to take place end 
next week. The joint testing would include metals as well as filterable dirt, 
so we would need to decide, in quite short order, on the test method we want 
to propose for metals for relevant parties to agree.

Although we believe the contamination would be dramatically demonstrated by 
the level of filterable dirt, the metals clearly would also be an important 
factor. As you may be aware, the loadport sample results which we are 
presently relying on to say that the cargo was on spec when loaded, was 
tested with "ashing" for metals. We would not be able to say whether another 
loadport sample would test on spec for metals using straight D3605. If it 
doesn't test on spec at the joint testing using straight D3605, the vessel 
owners would surely argue that the cargo would have been rejected by First 
Gas anyway, independent of the filterable dirt. Although such as argument may 
not defeat our case entirely, it is very likely to impact on the quantum we 
would be able to recover.

It seems that the preferred test method for metals at the joint testing would 
therefore be "ashing" to avoid conflict with existing loadport sample 
results. We still have SGS's support for that, but we need to convince Minton 
Treharne who acts for the cargo underwriters as well as the Owners/P&I Club. 
Still, just in case details of our dispute with Mitsubishi become known to 
Firts Gas, we may wish to avoid proposing a test method for joint testing 
that would be inconsistent with the one we ultimately present to First Gas, 
which for obvious long term objectives ought to be the CORRECT test method 
acceptable to parties whether D3605 or "ashing" or some other method. That 
said, I think if we are able to go with "ashing" for the joint testing, it is 
not likely to jeopardize our position with First Gas. 

I note Janice's preference for US experts over European experts for the D3605 
issue. Have we been able to get any US experts' view on the right test to use 
(whether D3605 or "ashing")? Has Enron formed a view on the "correct" test 
method? If we have been able to source a "friendly" US expert, we may want to 
have his input for the contamination issue. 

Your views and guidance would be most appreciated.

Thanks and regards
Matt







I also note Janice's preference to source for US experts to assist us on the 
D3605 issue over European experts and was wondering whether we have been able 
to for

Matt,

Subject to the views of Jim Studdert and David Best, given that we already 
put underwriters on notice that there was contamination, and given that we 
have worked closely with Minton's, underwriters' representatives, I would 
assume that we are under no time pressure to give underwriters a  total 
quantum before the joint survey  takes place; in fact, it looks like the 
final determination of ECT's total quantum of damages may be impacted by the 
results of the joint survey (although I would not necessarily want to say 
that to underwriters at this point).  

My preliminary review of the policy reflects no language in the policy which 
would require ECT to immediately provide a total quantum. The policy 
specifically requires, under "INSTRUCTIONS IN CASE OF LOSS", that ECT file a 
claim in writing against the "delivering carrier holding him responsible as 
soon as loss or damage is discovered even though the full exent thereof is 
not apparent; details can be furnished later.  Such action will not prejudice 
your insurance claim."  Let me know if you would like a copy of the pertinent 
policy; I have already sent a copy to David.  

I do have some strategy questions for David about the disposition of the 
cargo currently in Thailand and will give him a call tomorrow morning at 9:00 
a.m. Houston time to discuss.  Although I know that is quite late for you, 
you are more than welcome to participate (just e-mail me a telephone number 
at which you can be reached, or give me a call at that time).

With reference to Cliff Bennett's note, do you know whether our cargo 
underwriters require notice of the amount of our potential claim? As you 
know, previous figures were very rough estimates and only considered the 
rejected cargo and associated freight and demurrage. We have not computed the 
costs of the Thai cargo loss (if any) and the various testing and analyses 
costs.

FYI - Please see below Cliff Bennett's recommendations for joint testing.

I spoke briefly with Rich Slovenski regarding the Elang presently stored in 
Thailand. He confirms that the intention was to deliver it to First Gas some 
time end August/early September premised on delivery and acceptance of the 
first Elang cargo and subject to First Gas's consumption.

Cargo still not sold. Rich is not immediately able to calculate loss on the 
cargo basis First Gas Price vs resale price, but will be giving it 
somethought to arrive at an estimate.

The test results we have to date of the Thai cargo are somewhat inconclusive, 
but indicate Lead and Vanadium may be off spec, but principal reason for not 
delivering to First Gas is uncertainty of D3605 as a test method.

Summary of Thailand samples test results:

6 July 2000 - Ship Composite sample taken before discharge in Thailand was 
tested by SGS Thailand for Carbon Residue 10% and Filterable Dirt. Filterable 
Dirt was off spec at 6.3; Carbon Residue 10% was off spec at 1.5. SGS 
Thailand suggested that the  Carbon Residue 10% result was questionable and 
recommended retesting. There were however, no other ship composite samples 
taken before discharge in Thailand. Shoretank samples tested by SGS Thailand  
for Carbon Residue 10% and Filterable Dirt on the same date were on spec.

12 July 2000 -  Thailand shoretank samples brought to SGS Singapore tested on 
spec except for Lead which tested off spec at 0.3 (T-961) and 0.2 (T-964). 
"Ashing" test used for metals.

13 July  2000 - Thailnd shoretank samples brought to Caleb Brett Singapore 
tested on spec, but note different test method used (D5184/5185).

14 July 2000 - Thailand shoretank samples re-tested for metals by SGS 
Singapore:

Direct D3605
Vanadium off spec at 0.9 (T-964)
Lead off spec at 0.8 (T-961); 1 (T-964)
Vanadium + Lead off spec at 1.2 (T-961); 1.9 (T-964)

"Ashing"
Lead off spec at 0.3 (T-964)

Matthias,

As per my e-mail dd. 3rd August to Eric, from cargo Interests viewpoint it
is usually best in these circumstances to keep as many analytical options
open as possible. Certainly sufficient to enable the best chance of
establishing the cause. To that end, I would recommend that you provide the
other Parties with the test methods (ASTM D-numbers) and state that these
tests will be applied to retain samples from each of:

1. Pacific Virgo before & after loading, Australia (all cargo)
2. Pacific Virgo before discharge, Thailand (Batangas-nominated tanks, if
samples available)
3. Pacific Virgo before discharge, Thailand (Thai-nominated tanks)
4. Pacific Virgo on arrival Batangas (the samples upon which First Gas based
their rejection)
5. Pacific Virgo prior departure from Batangas (including bottom samples)
6. Pacific Virgo prior discharge Korea (including bottom samples)
7. Pacific Virgo, any other samples that are available and that might
progress the investigation


Some testing may involve composites, some individual samples. This will to a
degree depend on the lab's ability to get any particulates into homogeneous
suspension and keep them there long enough to make a composite. If that
can't be done, it will have to be individuals.

Insofar as identifying the particulates, should this prove necessary, I
think we need to keep all options open. While it is always possible to
perform unilateral analysis should disagreements arise, better to keep the
Parties together if possible. But not at the expense of limiting the
analysis' ability to determine cause.

I apologise if this all seems a bit woolly. But if you limit at the
beginning the potential extent of testing that might be necessary, it can
all prove meaningless.

I appreciate that testing cost plays a role in all of this. It is in
no-one's interest to do testing just for the sake of it and, as far as I am
concerned, that is not on my agenda nor, I am sure, is it on Enron's. But we
must be realistic. Depending upon the size of your potential claim (have
Underwriters been put on notice yet, by the way?), it might be worth
spending several $K to get to the root of the matter, rather than less to
learn nothing.

Best regards.

To:    SSY, Singapore
 Attn:  John Dwane / Chris Twiss / Leo / Helen Cheo

Please convey to Owners of Pacific Virgo as follows:


As owners are aware, Enron has suffered considerable loss and damage arising
from the contamination of condensate loaded in good order and condition but
delivered contaminated.

It is clear that Mitsubishi, as time chartered owners, would not be now 
claiming
freight or demurrage but for the contamination. There can be no argument about
this.  Since Enron is holding Mitsubishi fully liable for the contamination
according to the terms and conditions of the relevant charterparty, Enron 
takes
the view that it does not have a liability to pay either the freight or
demurrage.  Should Mitsubishi disagree, Enron suggests that all disputes are
referred to arbitration pursuant to the relevant clause of C/P.  Enron will
almost certainly be commencing arbitration once the joint analysis results are
known in order to recover their losses which have not yet been fully 
quantified.
We respectfully suggest that Mitsubishi reviews its entitlement to freight and
demurrage after the joint testing.

Please acknowledge.

Enron, Singapore

APC - note for Steve Jones
Mintons - note for Cliff Bennett


Steve Jones has been in touch with Cliff Bennett and had a lengthy discussion.

SGS are being asked by Cliff to draw up a list of samples which is crucial
before any test programme can be structured.

Both Cliff and Steve want to apply straight D3605 and D3065 with ashing. I 
agree
with this.

It is important that we know what methodolgy for ashing was used by SGS and
further to discussions between Steve/Cliff, I understand Cliff will be finding
out more details about this and passing information direct to Steve.

Separate tests will be carried out for filtered dirt and there is a 
possibility
that samples may need to be flown to the UK for later testing to determine
origin using more sophisticated techniques in the UK.  Until those tests are
carried out, Steve does not want to rule out the inert gas system.

Steve, and I believe Cliff, think SGS in Singapore are OK provided that Cliff
and Steve are in full attendance to make sure testing is carried out and
interpreted properly.

As I see it, the next steps are:-

1.   SGS lab in Singapore to be formally retained by Enron.

2.   List of samples to be prepared.

3.   Test programme to be finalised.

4.   Everyone to be satisfied about ashing methodology.

5.   Owners' chemist (whoever he may be) to be in agreement on joint test
programme.

Britt

I refer to the List of Samples I crculated by fax yesterday (copy attached 
for your easy reference).

The Batangas samples referred to in Ref. Page 3 have arrived at SGS 
Singapore. SGS Philippines has explained to Eric why some containers are not 
full :-

The individual tank samples were drawn ex Pacific Virgo and put into 
containers but were not sealed. They were transported to the Subic Bay lab 
where ship's composite samples were made for testing by mixing the samples. 
The remainder was put into containers and sealed. One ship's composite sample 
was tested. Parts of some other sealed samples were used (ie. seals broken) 
for verification tests. The remainder were re-sealed, hence some containers 
are not full.

Please advise whether you wish for us at this juncture to enquire with SGS 
Philippines about the results/raw data of the verification tests.

Matt

Suggest the following:

"We wish to respond to your fax messages of 11th August with regard to your
claims for freight and demurrage.

We note you have elected to refer both claims to arbitration.  Please note 
that
we have earlier elected for arbitration also in respect of our claims.

We repeat our earlier message of 7th August that you review your entitlement 
to
freight and demurrage after the joint testing of samples currently being
assembled in Singapore.  We shall also be reviewing our claim after the joint
testing.  Please note that we have already paid freight for the voyage to
Betangus in keeping with the intention we expressed to you in our fax of 13th
July which we note you attached to your recent demand.  This was paid as a
gesture of goodwill despite the evidence of contamination at the time.  We 
take
the view that it is reasonable to hold back any further payments and review 
your
claims when the joint analysis results are known to all interested parties.

On the subject of the joint analysis, kindly confirm the name of your 
technical
representative who will be attending at the laboratory of SGS Singapore when 
the
analysis is likely to take place.  Our technical representatives are 
preparing a
test programme and this will be sent to your appointed representative with an
invitation to agree".

I have put in the last paragraph assuming Mitsubishi has not nominated anyone
yet.

Gentlemen:

1.  I have spoken with David Best about the difficulty Paul Henking has 
encountered so far with getting any agreement from Mitsubishi to delay both 
the joint survey/testing and arbitration in hopes of a settlement.  As I 
understand Paul's suggestion, Paul wants to switch fronts and press our cargo 
underwriters to pay us off and handle the arbitration themselves (Paul, if I 
have misstated your strategy, please let me know).  I understand from Paul's 
e-mail that he does not think Mitsubishi will settle prior to arbitration and 
joint testing.

Unfortunately, while we want to consider all options, neither David nor I 
think that this approach will succeed.  We believe that our cargo 
underwriter's response to our claim will be that they, too, want us to 
proceed with the joint testing before they will consider paying anything on 
this claim.  We should also all recall that ECT performed a pre-sale survey 
of product from the same location that was off-spec.  Although we do not 
think that either Mitsubishi or the cargo underwriters are yet aware of that 
survey, such a survey would seem to raise an inherent vice issue in both 
proceedings.  Last, until at least the joint testing has been done, I think 
that the cargo underwriters would require us to act as a prudent uninsured; 
i.e., to name an arbitrator and vigorously litigate our claims.

Of particular note, Steve Jones, our expert chemist, has notified us that the 
samples taken for joint testing have a shelf-life that may be coming to an 
end in the near future.  If the samples begin to "turn" before the joint 
testing has taken place, the delay of the testing could be used against us in 
the arbitration.  Parenthetically, it also appears that a representative of 
the shipowner's P&I club wants to be involved in the testing.  It may be that 
Mitsubishi, as the vessel's charterer, has placed the head owner on notice of 
our claim against Mitsubishi, and of Mitsubishi's potential claim for 
indemnification against the head owner.

Under the circumstances, David and I agree that we should get the joint 
testing scheduled and done as soon as possible.

2. David and I have also spoken about Paul's idea of advancing payment to 
Mitsubishi for the freight claim of $760,000, and agreeing to revert to 
Mitsubishi regarding the demurrage claim by the end of November.  I assume 
that Paul means that we would in fact pay what we believe we owed on the 
$250,000 demurrage claim at or near that time, and that all these amounts 
would be paid on a "without prejudice" basis; i.e., that ECT could later 
pursue recovery of those amounts in arbitration against Mitsubishi.

The obvious downside of payment is that we lose our best potential leverage 
for bringing Mitsubishi to the bargaining table, but Mitsubishi has resisted 
that leverage so far.  We are very exposed to advance payment of freight and 
demurrage, subject to our later right of counterclaim if we can successfully 
assert that the ship was at fault.  By paying now, we can avoid the 
attorneys' fees (and, hopefully, some or all of the interest) that would go 
with an interim award to Mitsubishi.  I have not been advised of any 
anticipated problem with getting Mitsubishi to fund a substantial arbitration 
award should ECT be successful in proving its contamination claim and 
recouping the freight and demurrage paid.  

Under these  difficult circumstances, both David and I agree with Paul's 
suggestion that we pay the freight and demurrage up front, without prejudice, 
but only after we have informally discussed this on a solictor-to-solicitor 
basis, so that there is no misunderstanding of ECT's intent to pursue the 
contamination claim, and after a tribunal has been agreed to and any other 
concessions extracted that we can think of.  This will prevent Mitsubishi 
from dragging its feet after we make this payment.  

3.  David and I have spoken about the choice of arbitrators for this 
single-arbitrator proceeding.  He and Neale agree that using a Q.C. would 
give us the best shot at a well-thought-through legal opinion, and here, our 
best argument may be simply to argue that Mitsubishi has not borne its legal 
burden to provide a cargoworthy ship.  Based on David and Neale's suggestion, 
I have asked David to approach Mitsubishi's solicitors on an informal basis 
to discuss three Q.Cs that David and Neale find acceptable, and determine 
whether Mitsubishi's solicitors also find them acceptable.  Once that occurs, 
I will revert back to each of you with a recommendation of a single 
arbitrator.  That should hopefully occur today or tomorrow.

I will continue to keep you advised.

Team

Attached for your reference is  List of Documents (with short descriptions) 
relating to the Pacific Virgo. The documents form my Core Bundle which I have 
only had the chance to assemble today. I believe you would have copies of the 
documents either from the bundle I couriered to Mike R. or from e-mail, but 
if you have any missing, please let me know and I'll get copies to you. I 
will keep the List up to date and copy the Houston team. As usual, I welcome 
any comments.



I will be working to put together a similar list for sampling and test 
results and will copy the team as soon as I can.

Some material documents on the Tank Cleaning issue:

Costs were to be borne by Enron (item 4 of the List).
Enron regarded USD30,000 estimate for Butterworth cleaning by Owners too high 
and revised cleaning request to flushing with fresh water (item 8 of the 
List).
Owners did not have enough freshwater and proposed seawater flushing (item 9 
of the List).
Enron queried Owners on why there was insufficient fresh water for tank 
cleaning (no explanation to date) and reserved rights under C/P (item 10 of 
the List).
Enron gave orders to flush with fresh water and emphasised sensitivity of 
cargo for power plant (item 11 of the List).
Owners advised not able to flush with freshwater and no tank cleaning was 
performed before last cargo of Cossack was loaded (item 13 of the List).
Enron expressed disappointment that there was no fresh water to flush tanks 
and requested draining and stripping dry (item 16 of the List).
Enron asked Master the day before loading what preparations were done, but 
there we never got a reply (item 17 of the List).
SGS vessel tank inspection states "Master / Chief Officer guarantees the 
integrity of the cargo whilst the same is on board" (item 18 of the List) - 
have asked SGS for a copy with Master/Chief Officer's signature.

Pacific Virgo ETA Yosu Korea 23rd night. Earliest commencement of discharge 
24th morning.

Britt - Thanks for the list of questions. They help me focus with so much 
going on here. I'll respond with answers as soon as I can although I expect 
that I would need to consult with John Chismar (Trader - who is on vacation 
and due back 1st August) on some of them.

Regards
Matt

Richard, here's the latest thinking on the FGPC/ECT liquid fuel agreement 
conflict. In brief, it looks like we have an argument, but it is too early to 
tell whether we have the better argument.

>From David Best.

You  asked  for  a  preliminary  opinion following our telephone conference 
this
morning on Enron?s contractual remedies and exposures on the FGPC contract.

I am afraid the matter is complex and there is no straightforward answer.

First,  we  should start with the contract which I have now read.  I am 
assuming
the  NDC  date  has  passed,  but  not  the  conversion date.  Article 4.3 is 
an
acknowledgment  by  the  seller  that  the  buyer?s preference is for 
condensate
because of favourable tax considerations.  There is however an unfettered 
option
given by Article 4.4. to Enron to deliver alternative liquid fuel in the form 
of
gasoil or naphtha meeting the quality specifications.

The quality specifications for liquid fuel are set out in Appendix A.

Article 8.1 under the abbreviation T provides for a liquid fuel tax 
differential
which  is  a  price  burden  falling  on Enron as part of the price 
formulation.
However,  ?in  the event seller is unable to deliver condensate using 
reasonable
commercial efforts, but supplies another type of liquid fuel instead, T shall 
be
deemed to be zero for the first 600,000 barrels (in the aggregate) of such 
other
types of liquid fuel delivered in a contract year.?

Other relevant Articles are 10.2 (buyer?s right to secure alternative 
supplies),
the   whole   of  Article  10  (seller?s  default),  the  whole  of  Article  
13
(determination  of  quantity  and  quality),  12.4  (mitigation  of losses), 
and
13.3(a)  (?buyer shall be under no obligation to accept delivery of any 
quantity
of liquid fuel which fails to meet the quality specifications ??).

No  doubt  there  are  other relevant Articles, but the above seem the 
important
ones to me.

The  facts  have  been summarised already in numerous e-mails and 
correspondence
and  I  certainly will not repeat them, except to say that I think it is 
correct
that:

(1)   It is simply not possible to buy condensate applying test method D3605 
for
condensate.   For this reason, for example, your contract with Phillips 
Brothers
for the ?PACIFIC VIRGO? did not include this test method.

(2)   SGS  consider  D3605  is wholly inappropriate for condensate and have 
said
that  modifying  D3605  with  ?ashing? is the preferred method to achieve 
higher
reproduceability.   Indeed,  the  previous two cargoes of condensate supplied 
to
FGPC have been tested using ?ashing?.

(3)   The gasoil has been nominated for August to replace the contaminated 
Elang
arguably  because of the lack of lead time to find suitable cargo of 
condensate,
but  more  probably  because  the trader in question understandably is 
concerned
that  a  substitute  condensate cargo may fail if the plain D3605 test method 
is
used.

(4)   FGCP  have  said  in  a  recent e-mail dated 27th July that ?FGCP will 
not
hesitate  to  reject  any cargo which fails to meet the guaranteed 
specification
and  which  offers  any possibility of invalidating any guarantees or 
warranties
given  by  Siemens?.  They are therefore not prepared to entertain any 
amendment
to the contract.

Following our telephone conference, and having read the contract, I saw 
problems
for  Enron  and  decided  to  share  my thoughts with John Lockey of Essex 
Court
Chambers.   He  is the barrister specialising in such problems, often used by 
me
and  the firm for second opinions, and obviously helpful on a case such as 
this.
We debated the subject at length and came to the following tentative 
conclusions
which  I  shall  put  in  bullet form.  He and I are available for discussion 
at
08.30  a.m. tomorrow at my office and I propose to call you at that time to 
hear
your comments and to deal with any questions you may have on the following:

1.   We  think  that  it  is  not possible for Enron to argue with any 
realistic
prospect  of  success that the apparent impossibility of finding a seller who 
is
willing  to  sell  condensate  applying  test method D3605 satisfies the test 
of
using  reasonable  commercial  efforts to justify zero tax for the first 
600,000
barrels of other types of liquid fuel in any contract year.  It seems to us 
that
this provision is designed to deal with problems of obtaining condensate 
cargoes
due  to  force  majeure related reasons after the contract has been entered 
into
and is not designed to provide effectively a let-out because the contract 
simply
cannot be complied with at all from its start.  FGPC will simply argue with 
some
prospect  of  success,  that they entered into the contract and agreed its 
terms
regarding  pricing,  etc.  on the basis that Enron was able to supply 
condensate
applying  D3605.   This  squares with what they have said in their recent 
e-mail
which I have quoted above.  The same e-mail goes on to say:

?The  allowance  for 600,000 barrels was built into the LFPC to act as a 
?safety
valve? only to be used should circumstances demand it.?

2.   If  we  are right about what we say above, this means that Enron are in 
the
invidious  position  of  having  to  source  condensate  (to avoid the tax), 
not
knowing whether it is going to meet D3605.  If SGS test using D3605 and fail 
the
cargo, the contract supposedly gives FGPC an entitlement to reject.  Their 
cover
costs could include gasoil with its additional tax as a ?cost? since there is 
no
available  condensate  for  sale  on  the market applying D3605, assuming we 
are
right about this assumption in (1) above.

3.   It  occurs  to  us  that  it  may be possible to argue with some merit 
that
Appendix  B  has  to  be  construed  to  imply a term that D3605 only applies 
to
condensate if it is truly applicable to that grade.  You will note that 
Appendix
B  sets  out  a  test  method in one column and three grades gasoil, naphtha 
and
condensate  in  other  columns.   If  SGS  are  right  that  the  test method 
is
inappropriate, they should not be testing against D3605 for condensate.  
Putting
it  another  way,  the  condensate  could  be  on  spec applying the 
appropriate
?ashing?  method, and the test method set out in Appendix B will not 
necessarily
determine  this.  As you say, it is hit and miss.  Objectively, the intention 
of
the parties must be to apply the appropriate test method, or not to apply a 
test
method  if  it  is  not  capable  of  determining the contractual 
specification.
Applying  this  reasoning,  it means that Enron are not in breach by 
supplying a
cargo  of condensate in circumstances where the D3605 test is simply not 
carried
out because contractually it cannot apply.

4.  As we say above, we think SGS should not be carrying out this test at all 
if
it is entirely inappropriate.  Indeed, SGS, who are jointly appointed, should 
be
instructed  by Enron not to carry out the test.  There is some force for this 
in
Article  13.1(a) which says that measurement of quantities and taking of 
samples
for  the  purposes  of  determining  the quality of liquid fuel in each 
shipment
should be carried out ?in accordance with international standard practice at 
the
time  of  the  shipment  in question?.   It is not completely on point since 
the
clause  does  not deal specifically with testing.  In the event that SGS 
confirm
it is inappropriate to carry out the test and they simply do not test, the 
buyer
will  be  left  without  any test certificate that shows the cargo has failed 
to
meet  the quality specifications.  Should subsequently the buyer test on his 
own
under D3605 and it fails, whilst SGS independently apply the ?ashing? method 
and
it passes, we believe the buyers will be in difficulties in maintaining a 
lawful
rejection.

5.   Before  this  angle is pursued, we think SGS should be contacted to 
confirm
the test method is inappropriate.  We also think it is important that you and 
we
have sight of the exact wording of the test method to see whether on its face 
it
is  inappropriate  for  condensate.  This would help to reinforce the 
contention
that it is inapplicable to condensate in Appendix B.

6.   Finally,  I should like to have sight of the Appendix 1 ?Typical 
laboratory
condensate  analyses?  that  is  attached to the fuel supply plan that you 
faxed
yesterday.

We look forward to speaking to you at 08.30 a.m. tomorrow.

Regards,

David Best.

Dear Britt

Attached below is a summary of the test results.




Sorry I didn't revert with the summary sooner, but I needed the time to 
double check. I would still like to have Eric run through it just in case. I 
will update the team if there are amendments. Please disregard the rough 
summary for Thailand in my earlier e-mail. I had missed out one test (18 
July) and mistakenly said that Lead was off spec for the 14 July test.

I met with Neale Gregson today who has in turn spoken with David Best on what 
test method for metals we ought to propose for the joint testing. I 
understand David will be conferring with Steve Jones and advising.

Matt

PRODUCT

Matt,
 
Thanks for the heads-up on this issue.  I will confer with Janice and one of 
us will get back to you.  

Meanwhile, I think I may need further clarification about  what testing 
methods were used by SGS at loadport and at discharge in Thailand and the 
Phillipines.  My key area of concern is whether (as now appears unlikely from 
your e-mail) SGS tested using both ASTM D3605 without ashing and ASTM D3605 
with ashing at all the relevant points, and whether the test results were 
consistent; e.g., whether the product was on-spec for both methods 
immediately before loading, but off-spec for both methods at discharge in 
Thailand and the Phillipines.  May I impose on you to provide one summary 
chronology of the analysis done at loadport and both discharge ports, with 
particular emphasis on (a) whether both testing methods (ASTM D3605 without 
ashing and with ashing) were used, and the results, and (b) the results for 
filterable dirt? (You have just sent something like this for the Thailand 
cargo only, which I found very helpful).   Also, if SGS or anyone else has 
made comment about the reliability or unreliability of the filterable dirt 
analysis (or any other aspect of the testing done by SGS of this cargo), 
please let me know about that as well.

I appreciate your good help.

		 Subject: D3605

Dear Janice / Britt

I know that Janice has kindly agreed to return to the team to advise and 
coordinate with Mike Brown's team and myself in regard to the D3605 issue, 
whilst I am to look to Britt's guidance for the contamination on the Elang 
cargo. My apologies therefore for mixing the issues for the puposes of this 
e-mail. 

The joint testing of samples of the Elang cargo is planned to take place end 
next week. The joint testing would include metals as well as filterable dirt, 
so we would need to decide, in quite short order, on the test method we want 
to propose for metals for relevant parties to agree.

Although we believe the contamination would be dramatically demonstrated by 
the level of filterable dirt, the metals clearly would also be an important 
factor. As you may be aware, the loadport sample results which we are 
presently relying on to say that the cargo was on spec when loaded, was 
tested with "ashing" for metals. We would not be able to say whether another 
loadport sample would test on spec for metals using straight D3605. If it 
doesn't test on spec at the joint testing using straight D3605, the vessel 
owners would surely argue that the cargo would have been rejected by First 
Gas anyway, independent of the filterable dirt. Although such as argument may 
not defeat our case entirely, it is very likely to impact on the quantum we 
would be able to recover.

It seems that the preferred test method for metals at the joint testing would 
therefore be "ashing" to avoid conflict with existing loadport sample 
results. We still have SGS's support for that, but we need to convince Minton 
Treharne who acts for the cargo underwriters as well as the Owners/P&I Club. 
Still, just in case details of our dispute with Mitsubishi become known to 
Firts Gas, we may wish to avoid proposing a test method for joint testing 
that would be inconsistent with the one we ultimately present to First Gas, 
which for obvious long term objectives ought to be the CORRECT test method 
acceptable to parties whether D3605 or "ashing" or some other method. That 
said, I think if we are able to go with "ashing" for the joint testing, it is 
not likely to jeopardize our position with First Gas. 

I note Janice's preference for US experts over European experts for the D3605 
issue. Have we been able to get any US experts' view on the right test to use 
(whether D3605 or "ashing")? Has Enron formed a view on the "correct" test 
method? If we have been able to source a "friendly" US expert, we may want to 
have his input for the contamination issue. 

Your views and guidance would be most appreciated.

Thanks and regards
Matt







I also note Janice's preference to source for US experts to assist us on the 
D3605 issue over European experts and was wondering whether we have been able

I have planned to meet with WFW (Neale Gregson) and Capt Sawant again 
tomorrow. One of the issues I want to revisit with Capt Sawant is the issue 
of putting the Owners on notice of the sensitivity of the cargo. I recall 
Capt Sawant's opinion not to be as categoric as expressed in the memo, but 
want to absolutely sure. Like you, I feel it is a very important point. I 
will be discussing the issue of additional experts with Neale as well.  Neale 
Gregson is an experienced maritime arbitration counsel and has experts he is 
able to recommend.

As for privilege and discoverable documents, I discussed the issue with Neale 
today and he recommends that communication with experts be routed through WFW 
to avoid the issue. Reports to date and internal correspondence from in-house 
counsel would be privileged as well. Attached is Neale's fax on this issue 
for your reference:

Subject: Re: PACIFIC VIRGO  

Matt,

 Good report.  I am concerned about this expert's conclusions, the most

am concerned that anything he puts in writing may be discoverable in a U.K. 
arbitration proceeding if we use him as an expert and/or if he has any

Just a brief update. 

We are presently trying to consolidate all existing samples in singapore for 
joint testing and analysis. We are facing some difficulty with the Batangas 
samples because SGS Philippines has advised that they cannot airfreight the 
samples without using IATA containers and that would involve breaking the 
seals. Eric is examining our options to transport the samples to Singapore 
and will be seeking the input of Cliff Bennett (Minton Treharne). One 
possibility may be to transport by sea, but I understand that will take 5 
days voyage but vessels between Philippines and Singapore are infrequent.

Meanwhile, I have been in contact with external counsel Watson Farley & 
Williams (WFW) to finalise our legal position. WFW attended at our office and 
interviewed with Capt. Sawant of PacMarine. WFW is preparing the memo of the 
meeting which I will distribute when received.

FYI - the broker confirmed yesterday that Mitsubishi Corporation is the time 
charterer of the vessel.

britt,

thanks your reply which is noted. you will notice i have excluded david best 
and ngregson (?) preferring to keep my comments in house as privileged info, 
unless you feel this msg should be forwarded to them later.

firstly, i am getting nowhere with mitsubishi on the settlement front. i have 
gone so far as to mention this morning to mitsuru that if this does goes to 
arbitration, and should mitsubishi succeed in their position, this will only 
serve to increase our claim by a similar amount since these costs would then 
become part of our contamination claim. he seems quite content to let this go 
to arbitration. as an example, he was suppose to call me back this afternoon 
but did not.

secondly, with regards to your comments, i would just respond/add the 
following information:

1. i don't know if i am switching tactics so much as following what should 
have been done in the beginning (i.e. submit the claim to our insurance 
company and let them proceed against the owners). i honestly feel the 
arbitrators will say, "pay the freight (and possibly the demurrage now) and 
settle the contamination claim as a separate issue". clearly, the c/p says 
that freight is due without deduction once the vessel has completed discharge.

on the issue of the "pre-sale" survey, i have discussed this matter 
internally with eric tan. seems our position is that singapore considered the 
sample that was drawn as a bad sample as well as we were not sure that the 
test methods used conformed with the testing methods required for first gas. 
this position is proved by the loading of the pacific virgo when the product 
subsequently tested on-spec for first gas. granted, it might still become an 
issue but, as you say. it could become an issue in either proceeding.

i am getting a little confused on the matter of the joint testing. verbally i 
was advised that enron did not want to have the joint testing - at least not 
on a prompt basis. your msg now says that we do want to test the product and 
it should be done as soon as possible (as mitsubishi - and your advices that 
the underwriters and hear owner's p and i club would want). i assume this 
change is the result of the arbitration. 

be that as it may, i do have a bit of information that you may, or may not, 
be aware of or find relevant. when eric tan and i visited first gas in 
mid-oct to meet the personnel at first gas and witness one of the cargoes 
being discharged at the plant, we also took the opportunity to meet with sgs 
in subic bay to see their facilities and meet their personnel. during the 
conversation the subject of the elang cargo came up and the comment from sgs 
is that they were fairly certain it was off-spec due to "bugs". this may 
sound silly but i have heard of this before and is a problem with petroleum 
products.

it seems sgs even went so far as to test the product themselves for these 
"bugs" and got a positive result. this test was not requested by enron or 
first gas and was done some time later in this process. i understand there 
may be some concern on our part over our subsequent sales to third parties if 
we knew there were bugs in the product. i would have to say that this was not 
known at the time and even today is only conjecture based on sgs' advices 
mid-oct (well after these sales). sgs also described "changes" to the product 
which would fit with the cargo having bugs (i.e. a strong sulphur smell and 
change in colour).

if the testing is now done, i do not know if these bugs will be detected or 
not. however, if they are in the ship's samples, they may have changed the 
sample sufficiently that even a visual observation may detect the problem. 
the next problem becomes proving from where the bugs originated. were they in 
the previous cargo tanks that were not cleaned properly? or were they in the 
condensate when the cargo was loaded? obviously, testing of the shore sample 
prior to loading will determine the answer. if the shore sample is ok, then 
they had to come from the ship. if the shore sample also has bugs, then we 
should be claiming against our suppliers.

this of course assumes the suggestion put forth by sgs is in fact correct. 
just something else to be considered.

2) i am not saying that we pay the full amount immediately but only the 
freight portion (about $500,000). we then advise mitsubishi (or their 
lawyers) that we will now review the demurrage claim (about $260,000) and 
revert by say end nov. the demurrage claim has been sent to our london 
office's demurrage department and i have asked them for their comments on the 
claim. after all, there may be issues with the ship's pumping performance or 
simple laytime errors which may reduce the demurrage claim. they will try to 
get me a response before the weekend.

in this manner, we pay part of the money but still have a smaller portion 
which we may apply against our claim once the test results are known. i will 
leave this to legal as to decide how the approach to mitsubishi or their 
lawyers should be made

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL: ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION, ATTORNEY WORK 
PRODUCT

Matt,

1. I'm on the same page as Janice with regard to testing, although I'd like 
to spin out my thoughts a bit.  In my view, at the end of the day, it is 
virtually inevitable that both D3605 with ashing and D3605 without ashing are 
going to be used on the critical loadport sample (and, therefore, for the 
rest of the samples as well ) at the joint analysis.  

 Mitsubishi's strategy at the joint analysis will be to get the remaining 
loadport sample to come up off-spec on retesting, for obvious reasons.  

 Prior to the joint analysis, Mitsubishi will be aware that (a) D3605 without 
ashing is in the FGH contract and that (b) ECT believes D3605 without ashing 
may have a reproducibility issue with this type of product.  Given this, if 
ECT proposes to use only D3605 with ashing (our safest bet) on the loadport 
sample at the joint analysis, Mitsubishi will smell a rat and insist on D3605 
without ashing.   The same would apply, I think, if even if ECT proposed to 
use only D3605 without ashing as its sole test at the joint analysis.  The 
more different kinds of tests Mitsubishi can forcefully argue should be run, 
the more likely it is that one of them will show the loadport sample is 
off-spec.  Mitsubishi's goal will be supported by the general practice of the 
chemists involved, who will want to rerun every test previously run in order 
to get to the bottom of this.  

 My sense is that it would be very difficult under the circumstances for ECT 
to credibly take the position that only one test or the other (D3605 with 
ashing or D3605 without ashing) should be run; in fact, in light of what I 
believe is virtually inevitable (Mitsubishi insisting on whatever test we 
don't propose), and in order to keep from appearing to be overly concerned 
about the reproducibility problem, my feeling is that we may want to go ahead 
and propose both tests to Mitsubishi (assuming that it is expected that we 
would initially propose the proper tests to Mitsubishi, and not the other way 
around).

2. Can you let us know exactly who will be doing the hands-on testing of this 
product in Singapore?  I know that we nominated SGS Singapore, but does this 
necessarily mean that someone from SGS will be doing the actual work, as 
opposed to us just using SGS's lab?  As Janice pointed out, we need to make 
absolutely sure that (a) the lab is first-class and (b) whoever performs the 
test this time is very experienced with D3605 with and without ashing.  Also, 
it is my thought that we do not want anyone from SGS there who is aware of 
the pre-sale analysis that SGS did of the Elang Crude cargo.  This latter 
point, especially, needs to be handled with great care; if there is a need to 
communicate with SGS about any of this, I would suggest that you first confer 
with David or Neal.

Many thanks for your help.

      Britt  

 Again, many thanks for your help.

Matt:
I agree w/ Britt that we need to know more about what testing has been done, 
but I would think that the joint test should be conducted using the same 
method used at loadport (regardless of whether ashing is proper or not).  Not 
for the reason you mention (Mitsubishi may well argue about "proper" 
rejection, but that's not likely a viable argument, since the fact is that 
First Gas rejected the cargo and the dirt spec alone was sufficient grounds 
for that rejection), but for the sake of consistency.  It doesn't matter at 
all to First Gas what test methods were used or will be used on this cargo -- 
it's no longer any of their concern.  It's Enron's risk and sole 
responsibility to deal w/ costs following rejection -- per the contract.  I 
hope that we are not informing First Gas about anything that has happened or 
will happen on this cargo (I noticed a note from Jon Russell inquiring about 
the cargo -- I trust that we have politely refused to tell them anything).

Janice

PRODUCT

Matt,
 
Thanks for the heads-up on this issue.  I will confer with Janice and one of 
us will get back to you.  

Meanwhile, I think I may need further clarification about  what testing 
methods were used by SGS at loadport and at discharge in Thailand and the 
Phillipines.  My key area of concern is whether (as now appears unlikely from 
your e-mail) SGS tested using both ASTM D3605 without ashing and ASTM D3605 
with ashing at all the relevant points, and whether the test results were 
consistent; e.g., whether the product was on-spec for both methods 
immediately before loading, but off-spec for both methods at discharge in 
Thailand and the Phillipines.  May I impose on you to provide one summary 
chronology of the analysis done at loadport and both discharge ports, with 
particular emphasis on (a) whether both testing methods (ASTM D3605 without 
ashing and with ashing) were used, and the results, and (b) the results for 
filterable dirt? (You have just sent something like this for the Thailand 
cargo only, which I found very helpful).   Also, if SGS or anyone else has 
made comment about the reliability or unreliability of the filterable dirt 
analysis (or any other aspect of the testing done by SGS of this cargo), 
please let me know about that as well.

I appreciate your good help.

    Britt

		 Subject: D3605

Dear Janice / Britt

I know that Janice has kindly agreed to return to the team to advise and 
coordinate with Mike Brown's team and myself in regard to the D3605 issue, 
whilst I am to look to Britt's guidance for the contamination on the Elang 
cargo. My apologies therefore for mixing the issues for the puposes of this 
e-mail. 

The joint testing of samples of the Elang cargo is planned to take place end 
next week. The joint testing would include metals as well as filterable dirt, 
so we would need to decide, in quite short order, on the test method we want 
to propose for metals for relevant parties to agree.

Although we believe the contamination would be dramatically demonstrated by 
the level of filterable dirt, the metals clearly would also be an important 
factor. As you may be aware, the loadport sample results which we are 
presently relying on to say that the cargo was on spec when loaded, was 
tested with "ashing" for metals. We would not be able to say whether another 
loadport sample would test on spec for metals using straight D3605. If it 
doesn't test on spec at the joint testing using straight D3605, the vessel 
owners would surely argue that the cargo would have been rejected by First 
Gas anyway, independent of the filterable dirt. Although such as argument may 
not defeat our case entirely, it is very likely to impact on the quantum we 
would be able to recover.

It seems that the preferred test method for metals at the joint testing would 
therefore be "ashing" to avoid conflict with existing loadport sample 
results. We still have SGS's support for that, but we need to convince Minton 
Treharne who acts for the cargo underwriters as well as the Owners/P&I Club. 
Still, just in case details of our dispute with Mitsubishi become known to 
Firts Gas, we may wish to avoid proposing a test method for joint testing 
that would be inconsistent with the one we ultimately present to First Gas, 
which for obvious long term objectives ought to be the CORRECT test method 
acceptable to parties whether D3605 or "ashing" or some other method. That 
said, I think if we are able to go with "ashing" for the joint testing, it is 
not likely to jeopardize our position with First Gas. 

I note Janice's preference for US experts over European experts for the D3605 
issue. Have we been able to get any US experts' view on the right test to use 
(whether D3605 or "ashing")? Has Enron formed a view on the "correct" test 
method? If we have been able to source a "friendly" US expert, we may want to 
have his input for the contamination issue. 

Your views and guidance would be most appreciated.

Thanks and regards
Matt







I also note Janice's preference to source for US experts to assist us on the 
D3605 issue over European experts and was wondering whether we have been able

 Matt, please wait on sending this notice to Mitsubishi until you get an 
e-mail from me.  I have sent an urgent memo from all GCs, briefly describing 
this matter and asking if anyone is aware of any business that Enron is doing 
with Mitsubishi that would preclude ECT from sending this notice.  I will 
send you another e-mail by the close of business in Houston today(Thursday) 
with the results.  Thanks.

Suggest you send the following to the owners:

"As owners are aware, Enron has suffered considerable loss and damage arising
from the contamination of condensate loaded in good order and condition but
delivered contaminated.

It is clear that Mitsubishi, as time chartered owners, would not be now 
claiming
freight or demurrage but for the contamination. There can be no argument about
this.  Since Enron is holding Mitsubishi fully liable for the contamination
according to the terms and conditions of the relevant charterparty, Enron 
takes
the view that it does not have a liability to pay either the freight or
demurrage.  Should Mitsubishi disagree, Enron suggests that all disputes are
referred to arbitration pursuant to the relevant clause of C/P.  Enron will
almost certainly be commencing arbitration once the joint analysis results are
known in order to recover their losses which have not yet been fully 
quantified.
We respectfully suggest that Mitsubishi reviews its entitlement to freight and
demurrage after the joint testing".


I have since looked at the charterparty for the second leg sent to me 
yesterday.
It is quite clear that we freely agreed to enter into an extended C/P for the
second voyage on 19 July having agreed firstly to pay freight for the first
voyage (which has now been done) and secondly to pay estimated demurrage on 
the
first voyage to be paid "by charterers as quickly as possible against owners'
provisional invoice, also actual demurrage amount to be settled by charterers 
as
soon as possible".

In my view, therefore, we cannot succesfully resist an application for an
interim award both for freight and demurrage.  We can counterclaim back 
damages
for paid freight and demurrage assuming we are successful at a later stage in
proving breach by Mitsubishi of the Charterparty concerning the contaminated
cargo.

Please confirm that the cargo owner and charterer are one and the same, i.e.
Enron Capital & Trade Resources Singapore Pte Limited.  This appears to be the
case since the charterers are ECTRS and I note the manuscript entry on the 
first
page of the liquid fuel purchase contract recording an assignment of the
contract from Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp to ECTRS.

Matt,

 I've reviewed your good summary (which I know is subject to Eric Tan's 
review).  As you know, David has asked you in an e-mail sent today whether 
you have any evidence that the D3605 method with ashing was used at loadport, 
as your summary indicates.  In addition, I have the following questions for 
when you have time to take a look at them; there are a lot, so don't feel 
like you have to get them all answered tomorrow:

 1. Was filterable dirt analysis used at loadport? YES  If not, why not?  If 
so, what was the test method and results? D2276 ON SPEC AT 2.0 If a test 
other than D2276 was used, why was some other test used?  If (a) no 
filterable dirt analysis was done at all or (b) some method other than D2276 
was used, on whose recommendation/authority was this done?  Do we have any 
evidence that FGH was on notice/agreed to this?

 2.  Why was D5452 used for filterable dirt on the Ship Composite sample 
taken before discharge at Thailand?SGS THAILAND WAS NOT ABLE TO USE D2276. I 
WILL FORWARD E-MAIL DATED 05/07/00 FROM SGS THAILAND ON THIS ISSUE 
SEPARATELY. On whose recommendation/authority was this done? D5452 WAS 
RECOMMENDED BY SGS THAILAND AND APPROVED BY ERIC.  Do we have any evidence 
that FGH was on notice/agreed to this?  NO. TESTS SUBSEQUENT TO REJECTION 
WERE CONDUCTED BY ECTRS IN ATTEMPT TO VERIFY CAUSE/SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION 
AND HOPEFULLY RECTIFY AND DELIVER TO FGH. ALTHOUGH THEY KNEW WE WERE DOING 
RE-TESTS, FGH WAS NOT INVOLVED.

 3.  Was D2276 used at any time on the Ship Composite sample taken before 
discharge at Thailand? NO. THERE WAS NO OTHER SHIP COMPOSITE SAMPLE 
AVAILABLE. ALL OTHER "THAILAND" TESTS ARE FROM SHORETANK SAMPLES. If so, what 
were the results?  If the decision was made not to use D2276, again, on whose 
recommendation/authority was this done?   Do we have any evidence that FGH 
was on notice/agreed to this? 

 4.  Why/how did Caleb Brett Singapore/Subic Bay get involved?  BECAUSE OF 
THE VARIATION IN TEST RESULTS, ECTRS WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS NOT A 
FAULT IN SGS TESTING PROCEDURE AND ENGAGED CALEB BRETT TO DO AN INDEPENDENT 
TESTS AS A COUNTER CHECK. AT THIS STAGE, ECTRS WAS STILL HOPINGTO RECTIFY THE 
SITUATION AND DELIVER THE CARGO TO FGH.

 5. Re the Caleb Brett Singapore testing, all the usual questions about why 
D5184/5185 were used (instead of D3605), whether Caleb Brett tested for 
filterable dirt, etc. CALEB BRETT SUBIC/SINGAPORE DO NOT USE D3605 FOR 
METALS. I WILL FORWARD E-MAIL DATED 17/07/00 FROM CALEB BRETT SINGAPORE ON 
THIS SUBJECT SEPARATELY. D5184/5185 WAS RECOMMENDED BY CALEB BRETT AND AGREED 
TO BY ERIC TO COUNTER CHECK ON SGS TEST RESULTS. AGAIN, THESE TESTS WERE 
CARRIED OUT BY ECTRS WITHOUT THE INVOLVEMENT OF FGH WHICH HAS AT THE TIME 
ALREADY REJECTED THE CARGO. ECTRS WAS AT THE TIME ATTEMPTING TO FIND THE 
FAULT AND HOPEFULLY RECTIFY IT AND DELIVER THE CARGO TO FGH.

Again, please do not go outside Enron for answers to these questions.  Don't 
hesitate to ask if they require clarification.  I greatly appreciate your 
help.

       Britt

britt,

thanks your notes below. 

re bug issue - noted. just one question; do you think we should notify our 
suppliers in view that, if there is a problem as a result of the bugs, we 
will have to proceed against them??? they would want to have a rep to view 
the testing as well, i would think.

re joint testing - pls copy eric tan on what needs to be done once a decision 
is made on where/when the testing will be done.

re freight payment - before offering to just pay the $500,000, do you think 
we should propose it be paid to an interest bearing escrow account pending 
the results of the joint testing (or whatever other "pending" limitation you 
think might help us)??

Subject: Re: In re M/V PACIFIC VIRGO  

Paul,

Thanks for your e-mail.  Parenthetically, I'd be happy to explain how we got 
to where we are on our strategy; maybe a telephone call would be best.  Let 
me know when you are available.  I can call you early a.m. or late p.m.  

Re the bug issue:  we were aware of this, although I am interested to hear 
that SGS raised it with you and Eric in mid-October.  I have discussed this 
in the past with David Best, and spoke with him on the telephone this morning 
about what SGS told you.  We don't think we should put anyone on notice about 
the bug issue unless and until it appears and is confirmed at the joint 
testing.  Otherwise, we may be raising an inherent vice argument for both 
Mitsubishi and our own cargo underwriters.   Let me know if you have a 
different view (on this or anything else I put in this e-mail). 

Re Mitsubishi's response to our settlement demand:  David Best has just 
spoken with Sian Heard, Mitsubishi's lead London solicitor.  It is clear from 
her that Mitsubishi will not be settling prior to instituting arbitration.  
It is also clear that Mitsubishi will not consider any substantial settlement 
without Heard's advice.  Best believes that Heard will recommend that the 
joint testing take place before giving Mitsubishi an exposure evaluation.  In 
sum, while our attempt at settlement prior to joint testing was a worthwhile 
effort, to avoid the risk and expense of the problematic joint survey, it now 
appears to David and me to be at a dead end.

Re the joint testing:  Again, David and I believe that the joint testing 
should proceed as quickly as it can be arranged.  Neither our cargo 
underwriters nor Mitsubishi will move off dead center unless we do so.  Given 
the problems with SGS's lab in Singapore, the "bug" issue that SGS in Subic 
Bay has raised (again), and that SGS did the pre-purchase of product for ECT 
that proved off-spec, I have asked David to re-visit with Steve Jones, our 
chemist, the logistics and cost of having the testing done in the U.K.  I 
have also asked him to consider whether Heard might be amenable to splitting 
the costs of transporting the samples from Singapore to the U.K.  I would 
like to get ECT's authority quickly to authorize the joint testing to go 
forward.

Re the selection of arbitrators:  David has discussed three Q.C.s that he and 
Neale agreed were appropriate with Hearn.  Of those three, Hearn likes 
Nicholas Hamblin, who will charge 275 pounds an hour, and $1,750 pounds per 
day.  She will be conferring with Mitsubishi about using him as the sole 
arbitrator.  Given that we have initiated a good-faith discussion of the 
choice of arbitrators with Mitsubishi, David advises that we do not need to 
worry about sending Mitsubishi a letter tomorrow with our choices of 
arbitrator on it.  We can wait for Hearn to respond, then I will make a 
formal request for your authority to agree to one arbitrator who has already 
been accepted by Mitsubishi.

Re the without-prejudice settlement of Mitsubishi's freight and demurrage:  I 
read you loud and clear (and thanks for making clear that the freight claim 
is only about $500,000, not $760,000, as I had inadvertantly indicated in my 
last e-mail).  As I previously mentioned, David and I are on board with this 
idea, given the difficult circumstances of this case.

Let me know if I have inadvertantly mischaracterized anything you said.

Britt

britt,

thanks your reply which is noted. you will notice i have excluded david best 
and ngregson (?) preferring to keep my comments in house as privileged info, 
unless you feel this msg should be forwarded to them later.

firstly, i am getting nowhere with mitsubishi on the settlement front. i have 
gone so far as to mention this morning to mitsuru that if this does goes to 
arbitration, and should mitsubishi succeed in their position, this will only 
serve to increase our claim by a similar amount since these costs would then 
become part of our contamination claim. he seems quite content to let this go 
to arbitration. as an example, he was suppose to call me back this afternoon 
but did not.

secondly, with regards to your comments, i would just respond/add the 
following information:

1. i don't know if i am switching tactics so much as following what should 
have been done in the beginning (i.e. submit the claim to our insurance 
company and let them proceed against the owners). i honestly feel the 
arbitrators will say, "pay the freight (and possibly the demurrage now) and 
settle the contamination claim as a separate issue". clearly, the c/p says 
that freight is due without deduction once the vessel has completed discharge.

on the issue of the "pre-sale" survey, i have discussed this matter 
internally with eric tan. seems our position is that singapore considered the 
sample that was drawn as a bad sample as well as we were not sure that the 
test methods used conformed with the testing methods required for first gas. 
this position is proved by the loading of the pacific virgo when the product 
subsequently tested on-spec for first gas. granted, it might still become an 
issue but, as you say. it could become an issue in either proceeding.

i am getting a little confused on the matter of the joint testing. verbally i 
was advised that enron did not want to have the joint testing - at least not 
on a prompt basis. your msg now says that we do want to test the product and 
it should be done as soon as possible (as mitsubishi - and your advices that 
the underwriters and hear owner's p and i club would want). i assume this 
change is the result of the arbitration. 

be that as it may, i do have a bit of information that you may, or may not, 
be aware of or find relevant. when eric tan and i visited first gas in 
mid-oct to meet the personnel at first gas and witness one of the cargoes 
being discharged at the plant, we also took the opportunity to meet with sgs 
in subic bay to see their facilities and meet their personnel. during the 
conversation the subject of the elang cargo came up and the comment from sgs 
is that they were fairly certain it was off-spec due to "bugs". this may 
sound silly but i have heard of this before and is a problem with petroleum 
products.

it seems sgs even went so far as to test the product themselves for these 
"bugs" and got a positive result. this test was not requested by enron or 
first gas and was done some time later in this process. i understand there 
may be some concern on our part over our subsequent sales to third parties if 
we knew there were bugs in the product. i would have to say that this was not 
known at the time and even today is only conjecture based on sgs' advices 
mid-oct (well after these sales). sgs also described "changes" to the product 
which would fit with the cargo having bugs (i.e. a strong sulphur smell and 
change in colour).

if the testing is now done, i do not know if these bugs will be detected or 
not. however, if they are in the ship's samples, they may have changed the 
sample sufficiently that even a visual observation may detect the problem. 
the next problem becomes proving from where the bugs originated. were they in 
the previous cargo tanks that were not cleaned properly? or were they in the 
condensate when the cargo was loaded? obviously, testing of the shore sample 
prior to loading will determine the answer. if the shore sample is ok, then 
they had to come from the ship. if the shore sample also has bugs, then we 
should be claiming against our suppliers.

this of course assumes the suggestion put forth by sgs is in fact correct. 
just something else to be considered.

2) i am not saying that we pay the full amount immediately but only the 
freight portion (about $500,000). we then advise mitsubishi (or their 
lawyers) that we will now review the demurrage claim (about $260,000) and 
revert by say end nov. the demurrage claim has been sent to our london 
office's demurrage department and i have asked them for their comments on the 
claim. after all, there may be issues with the ship's pumping performance or 
simple laytime errors which may reduce the demurrage claim. they will try to 
get me a response before the weekend.

in this manner, we pay part of the money but still have a smaller portion 
which we may apply against our claim once the test results are known. i will 
leave this to legal as to decide how the approach to mitsubishi or their 
lawyers should be made

PRODUCT

Matt,
 
Thanks for the heads-up on this issue.  I will confer with Janice and one of 
us will get back to you.  

Meanwhile, I think I may need further clarification about  what testing 
methods were used by SGS at loadport and at discharge in Thailand and the 
Phillipines.  My key area of concern is whether (as now appears unlikely from 
your e-mail) SGS tested using both ASTM D3605 without ashing and ASTM D3605 
with ashing at all the relevant points, and whether the test results were 
consistent; e.g., whether the product was on-spec for both methods 
immediately before loading, but off-spec for both methods at discharge in 
Thailand and the Phillipines.  May I impose on you to provide one summary 
chronology of the analysis done at loadport and both discharge ports, with 
particular emphasis on (a) whether both testing methods (ASTM D3605 without 
ashing and with ashing) were used, and the results, and (b) the results for

Dear Janice / Britt

I know that Janice has kindly agreed to return to the team to advise and 
coordinate with Mike Brown's team and myself in regard to the D3605 issue, 
whilst I am to look to Britt's guidance for the contamination on the Elang 
cargo. My apologies therefore for mixing the issues for the puposes of this 
e-mail. 

The joint testing of samples of the Elang cargo is planned to take place end 
next week. The joint testing would include metals as well as filterable dirt, 
so we would need to decide, in quite short order, on the test method we want 
to propose for metals for relevant parties to agree.

Although we believe the contamination would be dramatically demonstrated by 
the level of filterable dirt, the metals clearly would also be an important 
factor. As you may be aware, the loadport sample results which we are 
presently relying on to say that the cargo was on spec when loaded, was 
tested with "ashing" for metals. We would not be able to say whether another 
loadport sample would test on spec for metals using straight D3605. If it 
doesn't test on spec at the joint testing using straight D3605, the vessel 
owners would surely argue that the cargo would have been rejected by First 
Gas anyway, independent of the filterable dirt. Although such as argument may 
not defeat our case entirely, it is very likely to impact on the quantum we 
would be able to recover.

It seems that the preferred test method for metals at the joint testing would 
therefore be "ashing" to avoid conflict with existing loadport sample 
results. We still have SGS's support for that, but we need to convince Minton 
Treharne who acts for the cargo underwriters as well as the Owners/P&I Club. 
Still, just in case details of our dispute with Mitsubishi become known to 
Firts Gas, we may wish to avoid proposing a test method for joint testing 
that would be inconsistent with the one we ultimately present to First Gas, 
which for obvious long term objectives ought to be the CORRECT test method 
acceptable to parties whether D3605 or "ashing" or some other method. That 
said, I think if we are able to go with "ashing" for the joint testing, it is 
not likely to jeopardize our position with First Gas. 

I note Janice's preference for US experts over European experts for the D3605 
issue. Have we been able to get any US experts' view on the right test to use 
(whether D3605 or "ashing")? Has Enron formed a view on the "correct" test 
method? If we have been able to source a "friendly" US expert, we may want to 
have his input for the contamination issue. 

Your views and guidance would be most appreciated.

Thanks and regards
Matt

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL: ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION, ATTORNEY WORK 
PRODUCT

Matt,

1. I'm on the same page as Janice with regard to testing, although I'd like 
to spin out my thoughts a bit.  In my view, at the end of the day, it is 
virtually inevitable that both D3605 with ashing and D3605 without ashing are 
going to be used on the critical loadport sample (and, therefore, for the 
rest of the samples as well ) at the joint analysis.  

 Mitsubishi's strategy at the joint analysis will be to get the remaining 
loadport sample to come up off-spec on retesting, for obvious reasons.  

 Prior to the joint analysis, Mitsubishi will be aware that (a) D3605 without 
ashing is in the FGH contract and that (b) ECT believes D3605 without ashing 
may have a reproducibility issue with this type of product.  Given this, if 
ECT proposes to use only D3605 with ashing (our safest bet) on the loadport 
sample at the joint analysis, Mitsubishi will smell a rat and insist on D3605 
without ashing.   The same would apply, I think, if even if ECT proposed to 
use only D3605 without ashing as its sole test at the joint analysis.  The 
more different kinds of tests Mitsubishi can forcefully argue should be run, 
the more likely it is that one of them will show the loadport sample is 
off-spec.  Mitsubishi's goal will be supported by the general practice of the 
chemists involved, who will want to rerun every test previously run in order 
to get to the bottom of this.  

 My sense is that it would be very difficult under the circumstances for ECT 
to credibly take the position that only one test or the other (D3605 with 
ashing or D3605 without ashing) should be run; in fact, in light of what I 
believe is virtually inevitable (Mitsubishi insisting on whatever test we 
don't propose), and in order to keep from appearing to be overly concerned 
about the reproducibility problem, my feeling is that we may want to go ahead 
and propose both tests to Mitsubishi (assuming that it is expected that we 
would initially propose the proper tests to Mitsubishi, and not the other way 
around).

2. Can you let us know exactly who will be doing the hands-on testing of this 
product in Singapore?  I know that we nominated SGS Singapore, but does this 
necessarily mean that someone from SGS will be doing the actual work, as 
opposed to us just using SGS's lab?  As Janice pointed out, we need to make 
absolutely sure that (a) the lab is first-class and (b) whoever performs the 
test this time is very experienced with D3605 with and without ashing.  Also, 
it is my thought that we do not want anyone from SGS there who is aware of 
the pre-sale analysis that SGS did of the Elang Crude cargo.  This latter 
point, especially, needs to be handled with great care; if there is a need to 
communicate with SGS about any of this, I would suggest that you first confer 
with David or Neal.

Many thanks for your help.

      Britt  

 Again, many thanks for your help.

Matt:
I agree w/ Britt that we need to know more about what testing has been done, 
but I would think that the joint test should be conducted using the same 
method used at loadport (regardless of whether ashing is proper or not).  Not 
for the reason you mention (Mitsubishi may well argue about "proper" 
rejection, but that's not likely a viable argument, since the fact is that 
First Gas rejected the cargo and the dirt spec alone was sufficient grounds 
for that rejection), but for the sake of consistency.  It doesn't matter at 
all to First Gas what test methods were used or will be used on this cargo -- 
it's no longer any of their concern.  It's Enron's risk and sole 
responsibility to deal w/ costs following rejection -- per the contract.  I 
hope that we are not informing First Gas about anything that has happened or 
will happen on this cargo (I noticed a note from Jon Russell inquiring about 
the cargo -- I trust that we have politely refused to tell them anything).

Janice

Matt,
 
Thanks for the heads-up on this issue.  I will confer with Janice and one of 
us will get back to you.  

Meanwhile, I think I may need further clarification about  what testing 
methods were used by SGS at loadport and at discharge in Thailand and the 
Phillipines.  My key area of concern is whether (as now appears unlikely from 
your e-mail) SGS tested using both ASTM D3605 without ashing and ASTM D3605 
with ashing at all the relevant points, and whether the test results were 
consistent; e.g., whether the product was on-spec for both methods 
immediately before loading, but off-spec for both methods at discharge in 
Thailand and the Phillipines.  May I impose on you to provide one summary 
chronology of the analysis done at loadport and both discharge ports, with 
particular emphasis on (a) whether both testing methods (ASTM D3605 without 
ashing and with ashing) were used, and the results, and (b) the results for 
filterable dirt? (You have just sent something like this for the Thailand 
cargo only, which I found very helpful).   Also, if SGS or anyone else has 
made comment about the reliability or unreliability of the filterable dirt 
analysis (or any other aspect of the testing done by SGS of this cargo), 
please let me know about that as well.

I appreciate your good help.

Dear Matt,

 As of noon today, I have conferred with everyone that I have been asked to 
contact regarding possible Enron relationships with Mitsubishi Corporation, 
and have either been told that there is no problem, or that (in Joe Hirl's 
case) no objection will be made under the circumstances.   Accordingly, I 
believe you and David should go forward with notifying Mitsubishi of ECT's 
intentions (per David's previously-submitted draft) Monday. 

 After you give the notification to Mitsubishi, you may wish to give Joe Hirl 
a call and so advise him, as he asked to be kept abreast of matter so that he 
would not be blind-sided.  Assuming Joe is not an ECT employee, you may wish 
to exercise caution in what you communicate to him, for privilege reasons 
(David can give you guidance on this under U.K. law).  If this proves to be a 
problem for you or Joe, let me know.  

 Also, Joe Hirl advised me that John Chismar told him that the contamination 
damage sustained by ECT could be/would be much greater than approximately 
$300,000.  While I understand that to be the case, given that we have not 
disposed of the cargo that was offloaded in Thailand, I wonder if you could 
let me know what John told Joe the damages might be (assuming that John gave 
Joe a figure).

 Many thanks.

      Britt

Richard,

This follows up on my telephone conference with you of a moment ago.  This 
case has taken a significant turn for the worse from ECT's standpoint.

As you know, we began the joint testing of the product samples in the U.K. 
this week.  The testing began with the loadport samples, which are the most 
critical. We concentrated on the filterable dirt spec, an area in which we 
believed we had the best chance of proving our case.  However, the tests 
showed that the loadport samples are considerably off spec for filterable 
dirt.  You may recall that SGS had found the loadport samples on spec in all 
respects.  The results of the joint testing reportedly caught all the 
chemists in attendance by surprise.

As will not surprise you, the chemists present for Mitsubishi and our cargo 
underwriters gave the impression that they felt no further testing was 
necessary under the circumstances.

There are three possible explanations that we are considering regarding the 
difference between SGS's results at loadport and the results during the joint 
testing this week:

1.  SGS's results are not credible (unfortunately, this would tend to be 
supported by the pre-sale analysis by ECT of the same or similar product 
that, if my memory is correct, was somewhat off spec for filterable dirt);

2.  the age of the samples (which were taken mid-year last year) may be a 
factor; and 

3.  the "bug" earlier reported by SGS, if it exists, may be a factor.

I have spoken this morning about further strategy with David Best and Jim 
Studdert.  We agreed that Steve Jones, our chemist, would suggest a hiatus in 
the testing, giving him time to send us a written report on his findings.  It 
would also give him time to hopefully liaise with Paul Henking and have Paul 
arrange an interview with the SGS surveyor who suggested that the cargo might 
have a "bug" in it.  Given the lack of specs in the contract with the 
supplier, it appears to me that we would have to find something significantly 
wrong with the product that falls outside even the very loose "Elang Crude, 
fit for export purposes" language in order to have some cause of action 
against the supplier.

Jim will contact our cargo underwriters and obtain a preliminary impression 
from them on how they see the case at this time.

I will continue to keep you advised.

Britt

P.S.--Paul, I would appreciate it if you could call David Best tomorrow and 
get the ball rolling on the "bug" issue.  Please don't put anything in 
writing about this issue for Steve Jones yet.

Dear David,

 This will confirm that  you have been retained on behalf of Enron Capital & 
Trade Singapore Pte Ltd. ("ECT") in the above-referenced alleged cargo 
contamination matter as its London solicitor.  Again, you will be liaising 
with Neale Gregson of Watson, Farley's office in Singapore, who will continue 
to perform the factual development on this case for ECT, subject to your 
direction and supervision.  Matt Lee, ECT's in-house attorney in Singapore, 
will set up a telephone conference with you and Neale for some time tomorrow, 
prior to opening of business in Houston.  In case you need to get in touch 
with him, the telephone number I use for Matt is 65-838-9103   I believe 
Neal's number is 65-532-5335.  I will call you tomorrow at 3:00 p.m. London 
time, 9:00 a.m. Houston time, to touch base with you.

FACTS
   
 The following is a thumbnail of the facts that have been reported to me.  I 
have not had a chance to run this summary past Matt, and would be grateful 
for any corrections he might like to make.  

 ECT purchased a quantity of "Elang Crude, suitable for export" from Phillips 
Petroleum Company ("Phillips"), and voyage-chartered the M/V PACIFIC VIRGO 
from Mitsubishi Corporation ("Mitsubishi"),the time-charterer, to carry it 
from Phillips' offshore loading facility in Indonesia to Thailand and the 
Phillipines for use by the buyer, First Gas Power Corporation ("FGPC"), as 
compressor fuel.  There exists a long-term compressor fuel agreement between 
ECT and FGPC that contains several specifications that the product needed to 
pass.  The agreement between ECT and Phillips does not mention any of these 
specifications.    

 One of the specifications at issue from the ECT/FGPC agreement is  ASTM D 
3605, which is used to test for the presence of certain metals.  According to 
ECT's surveyors, ASTM D 3605 apparently does not produce test results that 
are sufficiently reproducible to be useful.  ECT has apparently been trying 
for some months to convince FGPC of this, but without success.  FGPC 
reportedly advises that Seimens, from whom it purchased the compressors at 
issue, might void its warranty to FGPC if fuel is used that does not meet 
ASTM D 3605.  
 
 A separate specification from the ECT/FGPC agreement, for sediments, may 
also become at issue.  Months before the product at issue was loaded, ECT had 
Elang Crude from this same facility tested to determine whether it would meet 
the FGPC specifications, and found that the Elang Crude was on-spec for ASTM 
D 3605, but off-spec for sedimentation (again, a test separate and apart from 
ASTM D 3605) by almost double the allowed amount.  It is not clear why ECT 
decided to purchase  product from Phillips despite this test.  It is unknown 
at this time whether this test included any of the product later loaded.   
 
 At some point prior to loading, ECT did put the ship on notice that the 
cargo had to meet specifications for use as compressor fuel.  The ship 
responded by recommending that the tanks be Butterworthed, at an extra cost 
(per the C/P) to ECT of $30,000.  ECT declined, apparently opting for a less 
expensive fresh water rinse. Reportedly, the ship then advised that it did 
not have sufficient fresh water to perform a fresh water (as opposed to 
seawater) rinse.  I am not sure what tank cleaning ultimately took place, or 
who paid for it.  SGS, ECT's surveyors, did deliver a dry certificate to us 
before loading. 
 
 The ship loaded 659,133 bbls. (per B/L) at the MODEC Venture 1, Phillips' 
floating offshore facility in Indonesia, from June 20-21.  Testing of the 
shore tanks  at loading revealed that the Elang Crude did meet the 
specifications in the FGPC contract.  ECT paid Phillips an FOB price of $20, 
706,663.20 for the cargo.  

 After loading in Indonesia, the ship then proceeded to Thailand, where from 
June 28-30 it  off-loaded 410,697 bbls for storage, for the eventual use of 
FGPC.  No quality testing of the product was apparently done aboard or ashore 
at that time.  The ship thereafter sailed to the Phillipines for off-loading 
the remainder of the cargo.

 Upon off-loading in the Phillipines, the cargo was found off-spec for the 
presence of metals and sediment.  FGPC rejected the cargo; Wilson, Farley 
opined that FGPC was squarely within its contractual rights to do so.  ECT 
placed all potentially liable parties on notice and resold the cargo 
remaining on board to LG Caltex ("Caltex"), reportedly a Korean refinery, on 
a CIF outturn basis, for what I understand to be only a small (approximately 
$300,00) reduction in the value of the cargo.  

 ECT will not know exactly what it will be paid by the Korean refinery until 
the end of August, as the purchase was based on an August price index.  That 
cargo discharged in Korea and received by Caltex directly into its crude oil 
storage facility on July 26.  It appears that Caltex did not do any quality 
inspection before this occurred.  No protest or objection to the quality of 
the cargo has been received from Caltex.

 ECT is attempting to find another buyer for the Elang Crude currently in 
storage in Thailand, as it is apparently unsuitable for FGPC's use there as 
well.  Matt will know whether that product has been tendered to and rejected 
by FGPC.

  Mitsubishi has tendered an invoice for approximately $500,00 freight for 
the voyage from the Phillipines to Korea, and has submitted an invoice for 
approximately $250,000 for demurrage for the voyage from Indonesia to the 
Phillipines.  ECT has already paid approximately $790,000 freight for the 
voyage from Indonesia to the Phillipines.  Parenthetically, two different 
charter parties were used: one for the voyage from Indonesia to the 
Phillipines, and one for the voyage from the Phillipines to Korea.  

 A number of samples of the cargo were taken at the MODEC Venture 1,  in 
Thailand, and the Phillipines, at surveys that appear to have been jointly 
attended by ECT, ECT's cargo underwriters, and Owners/P&I.  As I understand 
it, the reports of the various analyses done to date are somewhat confusing.  
A joint analysis is being planned to take place in Singapore.  Unfortunately, 
the seals on a number of samples were broken by SGS, our surveyors; however, 
my hope is that there are a number of other samples that can serve the same 
purpose.  

 ECT has also retained a Captain Sawant of PacMarine to act as an independent 
expert for us in this matter.  Captain Sawant has prepared a report and there 
is a Watson, Farley memo containing notes of an interview of him.  As I 
understand his report, Captain Sawant believes that the contamination 
probably took place aboard ship, as a result of (a) inadequate cleaning of 
the tanks and (b) the cleansing properties of this condensate cargo.

 A related issue of great importance to ECT is FGPC's position going forward 
regarding what I understand to be a long-term compressor fuel purchase 
agreement.  Under the agreement, there are reportedly three alternative fuels 
which ECT may, given certain conditions, deliver to FGPC: condensate, 
gas/oil, and naptha.  Condensate is apparently the first choice, but must 
meet ASTM D 3605, which ECT now feels is extremely difficult to do, given the 
unreliability of the test.  Gas/oil can reportedly only be used where ECT has 
been unable, despite the use of due diligence, to locate condensate that 
meets ASTM D 3605.  If FGPC accepts gas/oil as a substitute, however, then 
FGPC is responsible for paying a substantial tax on it that does not apply to 
condensate.  Naptha will reportedly cause ECT to lose money, because of its 
lower Btu content.  

 Because of the problems with the M/V PACIFIC VIRGO product, ECT has 
reportedly contacted FGPC about accepting gas/oil as a substitute.  I have 
heard that this will cause FGPC to become liable for a tax in the range of 
$1,000,000, although this has not been confirmed.  Before agreeing to accept 
gas/oil, FGPC has requested a letter advising what due diligence efforts ECT 
has performed in order to secure product that does meet its specs.

 Parenthetically, I ask that Matt remind me who the ECT trader was who 
actually did this deal.  

URGENT  ISSUES   

1.  Who to use as ECT's experts.  Neale has recommended Captain Richard 
Gregory of Noble, Denton and Dr. Eric Mullen of Burgoynes.  I do not know 
whether Neale intends to use Captain Sawant, who has reportedly never 
testified.  I feel that the quality of ECT's experts will be of great 
significance in this case and want to make sure that whoever we use can, in 
your opinion, command the respect of a London arbitration tribunal in a 
proceeding against the ship or, if necessary, against the cargo underwriters. 
 If that means getting a London-based expert, let's discuss it and get this 
issue resolved before the joint survey that is being scheduled to take place 
in the Phillipines.

2.    Resolving ECT's insurance claim.  As you know, Cliff Bennett of 
Minton's (the same firm that Enron is using as its experts in the M/V HAVMANN 
matter) is following this matter for ECT's cargo underwriters.  I am told 
that Bennett has not been told by us about the pre-sale product sampling.  My 
concern is that once he finds out, he (and the ship) will raise inherent vice 
as a defense.  Please take a look at the cargo policy that I will be sending 
you by courier and (a) advise of any coverage issues you see and (b) give us 
your thoughts as to the best way of resolving ECT's claim quickly. 

3.   Whether ECT should file for arbitration before the ship does so.  You 
mentioned that the ship is likely to file an arbitration demand in the near 
future and seek an interim award of its $510,000 freight claim.  Given that, 
I would like your recommendation in very short order as to whether ECT should 
wait for that to happen and file a counterclaim, or proceed with filing an 
original demand.

4.   Whether ECT can raise the doctrines of impossibility of performance or 
frustration of performance or some other legal theory to challenge the use by 
FGPC of the ASTM D 3605 specification in this matter.

ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTATION

 This afternoon, I will be faxing certain key documents to you, and will send 
the rest by courier.  I am also asking that Matt telefax to you copies of the 
following documents (Matt, I apologize if you have already sent them to me):

1.  ECT's purchase agreement with Phillips

2.  ECT's long-term agreement to supply fuel to FGPC, and purchase orders (or 
the like) that particularly relate to this cargo.

3.  A copy of the first charter party, as soon as it is sent to us.

4.  Anything which reflects the terms of the second charter party.


 David, we appreciate your availability and look forward to working with you.

     Regards,

     Britt Davis

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL: ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION, ATTORNEY WORK 
PRODUCT

David,

 This will summarize our telephone conference of today's date.  I understand 
that you had an extensive and interesting conference with Matt and Neale 
Gregson of Watson, Farley's Singapore office.  While you are still wading 
through a great deal of new information, I understand your preliminary views 
to be as follows (subject to your further review):
 
 1.  You feel comfortable with using Captain Richard Gregory of Noble, 
Denton's Singapore office as one of ECT's experts, so long as he does the 
work himself.  You are going to do some additional investigation  with Neale 
of  Dr. Eric Mullen of Burgoyne's, who would be acting as ECT's chemist, 
given that his background may primarily be in fire investigation.  If you 
decide to use someone other than Dr. Mullen, please give me your 
recommendation as soon as possible, so that we can make sure that our "first 
team" of experts is available to attend the joint survey/analysis.  Please 
also let me know as soon as you hear for when it will be scheduled.

 2.  You felt that our case against Mitsubishi would be very dependent on the 
exchanges between ECT and Mitsubishi regarding tank cleaning, along with 
interpretation of various charter party clauses.  While Matt will correct me 
if I am wrong, I believe that Eric Tan was ECT's "point man" on those 
negotiations.  Perhaps Matt could liaise with you to set up a joint telephone 
conference with you, Neale, Matt and Eric on the line to flange down exactly 
what Eric recalls having happened.  I do not know whether Eric was also 
involved in negotiating the charter party terms, but if he was, that makes 
him an even  more important witness.  Matt, may I leave this with you to set 
up?  

 3.   You preliminarily felt that, as Neale recently suggested, ECT may have 
a case against the ultimate owners of the vessel that may not be subject to 
the charter party terms.  This is based on the applicable B/L,, which you 
have not yet had a chance to review, but which you were told the Master 
signed on his own behalf (rather than on behalf of Mitsubishi).  If you 
recommend that ECT pursue the owners, then ECT will need to seize the vessel 
and obtain a letter of undertaking from its P&I club.  Ultimately, ECT would 
then proceed with litigation, probably in the jurisdiction where the seizure 
took place, or, if the parties agreed, by arbitration.  This would be 
separate and apart from arbitration against Mitsubishi.

 Meanwhile, I authorized you to proceed with retaining a ship tracking 
service to locate the vessel.  I await your formal recommendation as to 
whether we should seize the ship, and the particulars regarding local counsel 
and expected costs.

 4. You will send a draft statement of ECT's position to Matt to forward to 
Mitsubishi, to the effect that ECT feels it owes Mitsubishi nothing for the 
additional freight or demurrage, given that it was all caused by 
contamination of the cargo onboard the ship.  I will ask for authority for 
you to send this to Mitsubishi and revert as soon as I can.

 5.  You are reviewing the FGPC/ECT contract and surrounding circumstances 
and will provide us your views in due course.


Many thanks for your help.


      Regards,


      Britt Davis

I checked the files and confirmed with Eric that the 4 November 99 test 
results have not been sent to Cliff Bennett.
The sample was drawn in early October 99 by Modec Venture, handed to SGS 
Australia and airfreighted to SGS Singapore for testing. All this was done at 
ECTRS's request.

There may have been as many as 10 persons involved in the testing because of 
shift work at SGS Singapore. The supervisor was Mr Liew Meow Wong and the 
test results were signed-off by Mr Freddy Koh (lab manager).

Regards
Matt

 PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL:  ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION, ATTORNEY WORK 
PRODUCT

 Jim, I have been asked to assist in the handling of the above-referenced 
developing cargo contamination matter.  I am writing this to you at the 
request of Rob Cole, with whom I discussed a possible "inherent vice" 
coverage problem with our cargo policy.  No one has raised the issue, but I 
wanted you to be aware that it might be raised, based on facts of which I 
have recently become aware.

 I have been told that ECT had a pre-sale survey performed at Phillips' 
facilities of the same or similar product some months before the loading of 
the M/V PACIFIC VIRGO.  The test revealed that the sample had almost double 
the allowed sediment level.  The test was reportedly performed in order to 
determine whether to purchase this product from Phillips, which ECT 
ultimately did.  It is unclear at this point why ECT decided to purchase the 
product from Phillips despite the off-spec analysis. 

  At loading, the product reportedly tested within all contract specs for the 
end user.  Later on, after discharge, it has been reported to me that the 
cargo was significantly off-spec for sediment level, as well as other things.

 I know that Cliff Bennett of Minton's is following this matter for our cargo 
underwriters.  I have been told that SGS not only attended the vessel for 
ECT,, but also performed the pre-sale sampling and analysis I mention in the 
first paragraph.  By copy of this e-mail, I am asking Matt Lee to liaise with 
Watson, Farley and make sure that they are aware of this and find out who at 
SGS performed this pre-sale survey.  My sense is that we do not want that SGS 
surveyor anywhere near Cliff Bennett or the ship's surveyors.  (Matt, if we 
have already advised Bennett of this pre-sale survey, I would like to know 
that as well).

 Let me know if I can provide further information.

         B.K.D.

Thanks for the detailed information you gave me in our lengthy telephone
conversations today and the exchange of views.

I have not finished reading all the documents yet and set out some preliminary
thoughts to cover the areas we discussed.

1.  Experts

I have no problem with Richard Gregory provided he is the one who does the 
work.
As for Dr. Mullen of Burgoynes, I do have some reservations.  He is 
principally,
in my view, a fire expert whilst acknowledging he does have chemistry 
knowledge.
I wonder if he is the right man for a technical oil chemistry job.   My
preferred choice is Mr. Steve Jones of APC Petroleum in the UK.  I have used 
him
before and found him clever and objective.  I know that John Minton (for whom 
I
have a high regard) regards him well.  Britt has said that it is important we
take the right decision here even if it means sending a UK chemist out to
Singapore to attend the joint sampling.  Mr. Jones therefore has my
recommendation.  A potential problem is that he is on holiday from today,
returning to the office on Tuesday morning.  He is fairly available after 
then.
Since it is unlikely that the joint testing will take place this week, nor the
very early part of next week, perhaps this is not a problem.

I assume the joint testing will be proceeded by agreement between the relevant
nominated experts to the test programme.  Mr. Jones, if he is appointed, can
deal with this in the UK by liaising with Mr. Bennett of MTD, whom he knows, 
and
others.  I wonder if SGS should also be shown a proposed test programme and 
they
should also attend the joint testing.

My own thinking is that Mr. Bennett of MTD should perhaps prepare a test
programme, but you may have already dealt with this and taken other decisions.

2.  Claim against time charterers

I have looked at the advices.  Priority should be given to understanding fully
the exchanges on the charterers' cleaning instructions.  It may be worthwhile
taking a statement from Enron's charterers' representation who was responsible
for giving the instructions and corresponding with owners.  It does seem that
Enron was annoyed that the vessel did not have sufficient fresh water on board
to carry out a water rinse which Enron wanted to order the vessel to carry 
out.
It seems that the vessel simply said that this was not an option because they
did not have sufficient fresh water on board, leaving Enron with no 
alternative
but to load on top with stripping/draining encouraged perhaps by owners' 
comment
that the last cargo was Cossack crude and the loading operation was load on 
top
basis, i.e. no tank cleaning was performed prior to loading the cargo.  I 
think
we need to explore carefully these telex exchanges before coming to a final 
view
on the vessel's responsiblity for the contamination, assuming it is agreed 
that
the cargo damage is attributable to the vessel and lack of cleaning (a point 
MTD
will be closely looking at with respect to the claim under the policy that
underwriters anticipate).  At the moment these telex exchanges look 
favourable.

3.  Freight/Demurrage

A long with others, I agree that we should not pay this to time charterers.
Probably the time has arrived where we should be sending a message along the
lines that the freight for the second leg and demurrage has been occasioned
solely as a result of time charterers' breach of their charter obligation.  
Put
simply, cargo was delivered to them in a sound condition and discharged in a
contaminated condition, most probably because the tanks were not fit and
suitable for the carriage of the cargo.  In our message, perhaps we can 
suggest
that further discussion on the matter should be put on hold until the outcome 
of
the joint testing and the parties should be guided accordingly by the outcome.
In the event of any continuing disagreement, the dispute will have to be
resolved in arbitration.  Personally, I think it may well be difficult to 
resist
an application for an interim award for freight since it will be argued that
freight for the second leg was paid on existing charterparty terms that, I
think, provides that payment should be made without discount.  I think I am
right in saying there was no separate charterparty entered into and we will 
also
have to take a closer look at the messages with owners when the second leg was
discussed.  The claim for demurrage will be easier to resist assuming it is
attributable to the contamination.  Any demurrage that is not attributable to
the contamination should probably be paid.

4.  Claim against head owners under B/L

For reasons discussed, we should explore the possibility of an arrest.  Britt
would like WFW to ask Ang & Partners if they are conflicted out, and also how
much it will cost to arrest (including how much monies are to be advanced 
prior
to securing an arrest).  Ang & Partners are not to be instructed yet.

5.  Your contract with FGPC

This appears to be unrelated to the contamination in the sense that I note the
cargo passed D3605 with "ashing" methods used and failed on 9th July both with
"ashing" and plain D3605 methods.  For reasons probably connected with 
Siemens,
FGPC refuse to amend the contract which is obviously the sensible thing to do.
I assume, by the way, SGS are right when they say that "ashing" is a
modification of the test method as opposed to a preparatory step or addition,
i.e. are SGS right in saying that the test method has not been complied with 
if
"ashing" is used?  It may be that the way to look at this is to focus on
mitigation.  It is obvious that Enron are boxed in and cannot find a 
condensate
that using this test method will generate an accurate result.  It is hit and
miss.  I have nof formed a view on how to proceed yet and am anxious to get 
this
e-mail off to you as it stands.

DAVID BEST

 Per your request for an update:

 1.  ECT sent its insurance claim letter out to Underwriters' adjusters in 
this matter last week.  No reply has yet been received.  We will monitor.

 2.  Mitsubishi has not pushed its demurrage claim of about $260,000.  Our 
solicitor, David Best, has had confirmed by our barrister that our time-bar 
defense against the demurrage claim is strong.

 3.  We are paying joint testing invoices 100% and submitting them for 50 % 
reimbursement to Mitsubishi.  So far, despite its agreement to do so, 
Mitsubishi has not reimbursed us at all.  We suspect that if we push this, 
Mitsubishi will start threatening to start up with the demurrage claim 
again.  At least until we find out what Underwriters' position will be, we do 
not suggest pushing Mitsubishi on this.

 I will keep you advised.

 Britt
