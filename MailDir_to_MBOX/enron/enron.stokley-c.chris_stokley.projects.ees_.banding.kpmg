Chris -

Find below the details as to the Power Baseline/Bandwidth Project Status.

Issues/Addressing Actions
*	Issues that have been identified with approximately 50 current
contracts visually reviewed:
*	Bandwidth (Max and Min) but NO baseline
*	Baseline with NO bandwidth
*	Min Bandwidth noted but NO Max bandwidth. 
*	Baseline with no level of aggregation noted
*	Bandwidth with no level of aggregation noted
*	No escalators for Baseline
*	No escalators for Bandwidth
*	CSC data has not been reviewed (Chris S to follow-up) - Data from
Project Ranger may also address (see below)
*	Decision on how to aggregate data volumes for CSC data (Chris S to
follow-up)

Current status
*	The Access DB tool has been completed with regard to requirements
submitted as of Friday, 9/21/01.  Development is in progress for the
calculation functionality, as is the necessary gathering of CSC/billing
information for volumes.  We expect that we can finish this request within a
week, if we can obtain suitable CSC/billing information soon.
*	We have met with a contact from the Enron side for the Project
Ranger.  Vivian Hart is providing for us thorough documentation on the
status strategy and tasks, as well as a data model depicting their solution.
>From this information we have identified and scheduled the necessary data
extraction information to assist us in determining what data source will be
used for the baseline/bandwidth calculations.  This data contains 8 months
of volume information (Dec 2000 - August 2001).
*	Statistics of data analyzed:
*	Missing data (common areas where data is identified as missing) : to
be determined when a greater population of contracts is analyzed
*	Contracts processed : 35
*	Deals processed : 350
*	Deals with baselines specified : 90 (of 350)
*	Approximate minutes processing time per contract : 8

Future planned activities
*	Annie Leung and one KPMG staff person are dedicated to the
baseline/bandwidth data capture activities.  One additional staff will be
added per week for the next couple of weeks.
*	Contracts continue to be copied at the Pennzoil Place location of
CSC (Houston, TX).  Preparations may be made by end of week for a trip to
Dublin, OH with the Gas Team to obtain any further contracts.  We are
working closely with a contact in the Legal Department to refine the number
of expected paper contracts; we will retrieve any that they have on-hand as
the week wears on.  After these activities, our final option will be the
originators.
*	Full validation is underway on the paper contracts available,
focusing on the CA utilities first.  As discussed, the Baseline/Bandwidth
data capture activities require less work, and so these activities are
occurring after validation procedures.

We will meet tomorrow at 10AM to discuss the contents of the Project Ranger
data extracts delivered thus far.  We can use the Team Room at 2946.
Briefly, we will need to cover the following:

1.	Addition of "STATUS" and "METER #" fields to the Project Ranger data
2.	Rationale behind the extent of customer data included in the Project
Ranger extract
3.	Specific needs of the Power Contract Reconciliation Team for
activities involving RPS and CSC data

Hi Chris,

Here is a briefing from my phone conversation with Mike Kim regarding the
usage reports.  Mike will give us more details when he gets back on Tuesday.


California Usage Extract

MDA 2.1 is the new meter database which contains extracted information from
the Cheop System, CSC system and updated position.  

Mike may have data from 1999-2000 and will be contacting us with this
information on Tuesday 9/11.   Per Mike, the 98-99 deals have no specified
baseline, they must be taken at face value.  

National Usage Extract (i.e. Arch Diocese of Chicago, MultiFiber Glass)

The National Usage data is extracted from the Fazer Database


Also, I left Dennis a message regarding the 80-85% of the Discount Frozen
Tariff vs the18,000 power deals in RPS.  I have not heard from him yet.

Thanks,

Annie

Steven - 

Please find attached the scorecard for the Power Validation/Reconciliation
Project.  In the scorecard, there are two important notes related to the
reconciliation effort and the collection of paper documentation.  We can
discuss these further on Monday if you wish, although I think that you are
already informed of these.

Additionally, since we are still working out the metrics on throughput, the
relation to fees consumption is not noted.  

Talk to you on Monday.

Kristin/Steven -

Thanks for the reply.  To answer your questions:

1.	The assistance you and Steven will be giving by going through some
contracts will be invaluable.  We have had several meetings lately with
representatives from all sorts of Enron groups, but have still not been able
to at least minimally define a solid contract.  This is an absolute
necessity for designing and building the validation and reconciliation
tools.
2.	It is actually Steve Watson, not Scott.  That was my mistake.  He is
a contact of ours in Toby Ellis' group, which is gathering power contracts
and copying them for us on an ongoing basis, including new business.  The
process being followed for this detailed in the attached presentation.  We
have not fully developed a plan for how to handle new business, but such a
decision is forthcoming.
3.	As for the number of contracts, I am not sure.  We of course have
the paper copies delivered so far, which equal 6 letter-size boxes, with
about 5-7 pages per each contract.  On top of that, there are some contracts
being copied at CSC, totaling about 10 full file drawers, although we are
not sure yet of the overlap of these with our already on-hand copies.
Finally, we do have extracts from the RPS and CSC (Loadstar and STAT)
systems.  The CSC dump equaled about 32000 records, which are summarized in
the attached Excel spreadsheet.  The RPS dump equaled about 15000 records,
but no real analysis of the comprehensiveness of the data has been executed.
We are working with IT and business representatives to garner a more keen
understanding of the fields themselves, as well as determining what
additional ones can be of use to us, so as to formulate a final request for
RPS data dump.
4.	Rest assured that the work is being executed.  We currently have 6-7
staff persons on hand already.  With the preparation of the Access DB for
contract validation today, alongside our already available set of contracts,
there will be plenty of data entry and validation work to do.

Please contact me if there are any other topics you wish to discuss.  I can
be reached by any means as listed below.

Subject: RE: Update - Power Contract Validation/Reconciliation Project


Josh,
Thanks for the update.  Please include Steven Fisher on all
communication related to the project.  He is leading this project from
Enron's side.  Just a few questions/comments:
- Steven is in the process of finalizing necessary fields.  Our plan is
to go through a few contracts ourselves to ensure we are not missing
anything before you guys ramp up.
- Who is Scott Watson?  
- How many contracts do we think we have? I may have an EES resource to
help track down contracts.  
- Let's just make sure we have enough contracts/work to keep that many
people busy.  I'm doubtful that we do at this point.
Thanks again,
Kristin





Kristin -

I just wanted to drop you a line since my last email communication last
week
to give you a status on our current activities for the Power Contract
Validation/Reconciliation Project.

1.	The Access Database that will be used for the validation and
reconciliation processes is 70% complete.  Our estimate is about 1.5-2
days
for completion.  The main issue slowing the development process is that
we
are still trying to identify all of the required fields for a complete
Power
contract.  After doing so, we will need to go back to the folks working
with
Scott Mills to do another RPS data extraction.
2.	Toby Ellis' group has been working to gather paper contracts
from
the Legal Dep't, CSC, and Origination so that we have all of the sources
necessary for validation and reconciliation.  As further contracts are
generated and/or located, they are copied and on a daily basis, we are
to
meet with Scott Watson mid-afternoon for ongoing collection.
4.	Leveraging the experiences of the Gas Project, we are currently
documenting the processes and procedures that the staff personnel will
use
to actually execute the validation and reconciliation procedures.  This
should ensure a smooth transition for them.  I will look for Chris',
Murray's, and your recommendations for these at some point by end of
week.
5.	We are currently ramping up the staff involved with this
project.
By week-end, we should have about 7-8 staff personnel on board.  Finding
a
physical location for everyone will be difficult.  Murray O'Neil, Chris
Stokley, and one of the office managers in 3 Allen are aware of this
need
and its urgency, and are working with me to arrange the space.

Please let me know if you have any questions about the above.  I can be
reached at any of the numbers/locations below.  Thanks.

Chris -

Sorry for the delay again.  We have had a very busy two days, with the hopes
for bluer skies starting tomorrow.  Please read the below and let me know
where your concerns are.  Of course, in the issues sections, we will most
likely need your assistance in overcoming.

Issues/Addressing Actions
*	Locating a reliable source for volume actuals remains difficult.  
*	I have still not been able to obtain Michael Frazier's 12-months
to-date report on volumes, but upon doing so we can determine the source's
value.
*	I have put a call out to Eric Evans, a Manager at CSC in Dublin, OH,
to discuss the Project Ranger, where they went out a validated actual
volumes.  We need to confirm the target set of counterparties and/or
utilities used here so that we can leverage their information for our
project.
*	As a team, it is still not clear as to our direction for handling
contracts that do not have baselines/bandwidths defined.

Current status
*	Completed PG&E baseline/bandwidth information capture (based only on
the paper contracts on hand already).  This amounted to 25 paper contracts
and 44 deals.  The timing for processing one contract is being determined so
that we can prepare a thorough analysis of the time and expenses required to
complete the project.
*	The Access DB tool has been completed with regard to to-date
submitted requirements, both front- and back-end.  We are awaiting your
approval and further requirements definition, in addition to the potential
change efforts.
*	We have confirmed a process for working the
Validation/Reconciliation and Baseline/Bandwidths projects in parallel.
Contracts will first go through the Validation/Reconciliation phase, then
through the Baseline/Bandwidths phase.  Due to the lower amount of time
required to process a single contact, a smaller, dedicated team of
personnel, under Annie Leung's organization, will be on hand to perform the
Baseline/Bandwidths information capture activities.

Future planned activities
*	Continue Baseline/Bandwidths information capture activities to
gather metrics; the process is to begin in full on Monday.

Chris,

These are the metrics for the reviewed California contracts


  Actual Baseline (stating MWHs) with Band Min/Max   2 of  124

  Baseline with "KWH used at all facilities during the first contract year"
language with band  22 of 24
  
  Baseline with "Other" language  74 of 124
*	Historical mo. Avg's(if available) & next 24 mo's from agreement
date;
*	KWH's for 12 months preceding the service date;
*	KWH used at all facilities during the first contract year OR if
needed for first year, the 12 months preeceding the effective date) with
Band  
*	8,000(MWH)for first year,  and for each year there after, the actual
usage for the 12 month period following the effective date

  Bandwidth with NO Baseline 10 0f 124

  Baseline with NO Bandwidth 9 of 124

  NO Baseline and NO Bandwidth 8 of 124


In summary,
Contracts with both Baseline and Band information is 92 of 124  (This is the
total of those with ANY baseline language and band in the contract)

This may have changed from what we gave you yesterday since data was being
entered as we spoke. This is current as of last evening.

Just a reminder to everyone that we will be meeting with Dickson Koo
tomorrow at 2pm to discuss the Power Batch Modules and how pricing, volumes,
etc., are calculated and fed into the RPS system.  As well, considering the
potential for large amounts of manual data entry of contracts during our
validation procedures, we will be discussing options for appropriately
handling this on a periodic basis.

Chris -

As discussed, we are having issues with the RPS extract completion.  I have
cc'd you on another message with status to Kristin Albrecht.  Some of the
other issues we are having are listed there.  I will use this message to
elaborate on the contract details and RPS extraction in particular.

1.  There are some data fields missing from the extract that we will
definitely need.  These include the following:

- Volume Data (per unit time, aggregation level, total for contract)
- Start and End Date of Contract
- Pricing Data (type: indexed, fixed, etc.)
- Counterparty ID
- Deal Date (inception date)
- MTM Value

The problem is not that we do not understand these issues, so much as we
need to make sure to standardize the way the data is extracted from RPS for
each contract.  In doing so, we will be able to finish the Access Database
on the back end.  As for the front end of the database, we are ready for a
demo of the forms and fields to be used for the validation and
reconciliation procedures.  As planned, today or tomorrow we will do such.

2.  In addition, we need to arrange for a generic, introductory
presentation/discussion for the staff personnel to understand how Power
contracts work, what data pieces are of particular importance, and what
variations may be encountered.  Given the six boxes of contracts that we
already have, it should be possible to select a sampling of these with the
expertise of an Enron EES (Power) person to demonstrate the concepts
inherent there.  This will be absolutely critical to the efficiency and
success of our validation and reconciliation team.  It may also lead to
slight reconfiguration measures of the Access Database.

As it stands, those are the major issues we are encountering.  Please assist
with coordinating your or the appropriate person's time for resolution.  We
are looking to take care of these promptly so that the team can launch
headlong into validation/reconciliation effort.

Paige,

I set up a time with your admin to meet with you tomorrow about the baseline
database at 10:30am.  Please let me know if that will work out for you.  

I also met with Chris in the afternoon and gave him an overview on what we
went over today.  He will try to come to the meeting tomorrow.

Attached is a matrix of our discussion from Tuesday where we described the result of finding contracts in each of the different areas (ie. CSC / Avista, RPS or the paper contract).

 
In the original version of this table CSC and Avista were separated based on an assumption that there should be feeds between the two systems.  After the meeting at 11:00 on 10/4 this assumption was changed, such that CSC and Avista are both sources of billing / usage data.

Please call me at 832 465 5443 if you have any questions.

Chris as discussed this morning attached is the scope document.

 
This morning's meeting has helped in defining the types of calculations / reports that will be needed in the database.  

Outcomes from the meeting are:
Verify transaction economics for newer contracts
Power Baseline team to compile data so that you can get an indication on the number of contracts that have baseline information for California.  
Data relating to material change will be captured and we will attempt to identify trends in the data captured.
Process flow to be prepared for baseline / bandwidth capture

Items that we are waiting on from you are:
Confirmation that we will be basing calculations for bandwidth on Project Ranger data
Copy of some sample MDMA data for use in constructing the database.
Confirmation of the scope described in the attached document.

Call me if you have any questions at 832 465 5443.

Todd -

So sorry to dump this on you last minute.  They have just sent me another
requirement for the RPS data dump.  We will also need the pass through costs
as a field for each record in the data dump.

Please let me know if this is going to be a problem.  We are still wanting
to get the data dump today, even if you cannot satisfy this last request.
We can get the final field later.

Thanks.

Another field for pass through costs will need to be added to the
database.  Also when you get the meeting set with the power deal
management person to discuss data input into RPS Kristin and I would
like to participate.  I should be around all day if you need anything.

Murray -

Sorry for the delay.  We spent a lot of time this morning working with the
designer of the Gas solution.  We have a much better understanding of their
business case now, and of course the resultant IT solution.  This should
help us in attacking the Power issue.

Attached are the updated memo I sent yesterday, with a more detailed
description and an illustration of the data flow, and a new document with a
set of questions that we may use to steer our initial information gathering
sessions.  Please take a look at these and let me know if you have any
questions.

Annie and I will be meeting with Chris for more business case understanding
next week.  I look forward to this time, and will work with Randy Wilson to
post status to you by week-end.  Thanks.

Chris/Steven -

As a recap to the meeting today with Dennis Benevides, I have a few points
to confirm with you guys.

General
1.	There are approximately 200 contracts in the CA market, of varying
types and structures (discounted frozen tariffs [~80%] and outsourced
commodity [~20%]), including penalty terms (e.g., positive differences on
underage and overage), start/end dates, maturity of contract (e.g., 2001 is
the 3rd year of a 5 year agreement), and bandwidths.
2.	The CA market contracts are typically 3-4 year terms, with most
having 1-2 years to go for expiration.  Also, a lot of these have bandwidths
of +/- 10%, tied to an annual consumption amount.
3.	The CA market contracts have undergone a true-up process over the
last 6-12 months, with the books (i.e., RPS) being updated concurrently.
However, actual usage was not tested against these true-up values.  Mike Kim
has information regarding usage and baselines.
4.	The other markets are NY, NJ, Maine, and Illinois, with NJ and
Illinois typically employing regional commodity transactions and +/- 10%
bandwidths and positive differences on settlements.
5.	Dennis mentioned that a lot of the contracts may not be settled as
yet, due to the terms, which hold that the tail-end of the contract
experiences most of the financial impact.  This will have to be confirmed to
assist with scoping our settlement project.

Action Items - Validation/Reconciliation
1.	Understand the different types of contracts, both chronologically
and regionally.  
2.	Define the minimal requirements for contract validation and
reconciliation procedures.
3.	Implement these parameters into the Access database solution.
 ----- Validate/Reconcile contracts -----
4.	Determine the contracts in the CA pool (delivered by Ian McAbeer)
that match with the RPS data dump (to be delivered by Monday hopefully),
then get with Karen Cordova in legal to retrieve the balance of the
contracts.
 ----- Validate/Reconcile contracts -----

Action Items - Settlements
1.	Contact Dennis Benevides again to get the list of his top 40 CA
contracts; compare these with the 200 paper contracts delivered by Ian
McAbeer to gauge the exposure.
1.	Contact Mike Kim to discuss his insight into usage information; use
this information to determine what exactly has been done to
bandwidths/baselines as a result of the true-up project.
2.	Determine the minimal requirements for establishing, correcting,
and/or settling off of a baseline.
3.	Implement these parameters into the Access database solution.

Erling,

Attached is the contract language we have seen regarding baseline/band
consumption.  Please review and we can discuss it in detail during our 9am
meeting Monday.
I will also bring some sample contracts.  Please call if you have any
questions 832-524-9850.

Thanks,

Annie

Todd -

Just to recap from our meeting this morning.

Discussion Points
1.	The following personnel are familiar with the batch module
architecture:  Ress Young, Dickson Koo, and Rogers Herndon.
2.	On the IT side, the following personnel can assist with data
extraction/description from RPS:  Charles Alvarez (*main contact), Ed
Calderon, Scott Yergin.
3.	On the Origination side, Phil Laden is familiar with the creation of
batch modules.

Action Items
1. (Todd Taylor)  We should expect a listing of all the available data for
extract from RPS.  This list should be sent to all of the parties on this
email by end of day Friday.
2. (Power Team)  We will redefine the RPS extract list, including the
information reviewed in #1 and that discussed in our meeting this morning.
The data dump will be delivered at the latest Wednesday, but our target is
today.  Please send it in ZIP format to limit the size of the email.  Again,
please copy all of the parties on this email.  The redefined extraction list
will include the current listing of fields, plus information regarding the
following.  (Should Annie, Erin, and Steven finalize this request, and
forward it to you via email?)
	- penalty parameters
	- actual and contractual max/min usage amounts
	- the financial instrument of the deal
	- records for multiple utilities at one site, plus an indicator of
this for such records
	- the RPS unique identifier
	- the name of the curve used to mark the deal to market
	- rate combo ID
	- aggregation level of MWH ON/OFF, pvMWH ON/OFF, and MW ON/OFF
values
3. (Power Team)  We will contact Dickson Koo for a meeting to discuss the
batch modules.  This will allow us to understand what all the calculations
and details are that are uploaded to the RPS system, in addition to
providing for us some take-away copies of the batch modules.
4. (Power Team)  We will establish a protocol for backing up the Access
database on a daily (M-F) basis to the KPMG server.

Guys -

Please review my amended requirements for the Baseline/Bandwidth project.  I
think the approach will be relatively simple, with a lot of data entry on
the side of our staff.  That notwithstanding, I think that our requirements
are pretty solid, with the exception of the code/calculations required for
actually establishing baselines/bands where they do not exist.  We will need
to establish processes and procedures for doing so; this for the staff
actually performing the contract-by-contract work.  We should discuss this
stuff again today.  thanks.

Subject: RE: Update - Power Contract Validation/Reconciliation Project


Kristin/Steven -

Thanks for the reply.  To answer your questions:

1.	The assistance you and Steven will be giving by going through some
contracts will be invaluable.  We have had several meetings lately with
representatives from all sorts of Enron groups, but have still not been able
to at least minimally define a solid contract.  This is an absolute
necessity for designing and building the validation and reconciliation
tools.
2.	It is actually Steve Watson, not Scott.  That was my mistake.  He is
a contact of ours in Toby Ellis' group, which is gathering power contracts
and copying them for us on an ongoing basis, including new business.  The
process being followed for this detailed in the attached presentation.  We
have not fully developed a plan for how to handle new business, but such a
decision is forthcoming.
3.	As for the number of contracts, I am not sure.  We of course have
the paper copies delivered so far, which equal 6 letter-size boxes, with
about 5-7 pages per each contract.  On top of that, there are some contracts
being copied at CSC, totaling about 10 full file drawers, although we are
not sure yet of the overlap of these with our already on-hand copies.
Finally, we do have extracts from the RPS and CSC (Loadstar and STAT)
systems.  The CSC dump equaled about 32000 records, which are summarized in
the attached Excel spreadsheet.  The RPS dump equaled about 15000 records,
but no real analysis of the comprehensiveness of the data has been executed.
We are working with IT and business representatives to garner a more keen
understanding of the fields themselves, as well as determining what
additional ones can be of use to us, so as to formulate a final request for
RPS data dump.
4.	Rest assured that the work is being executed.  We currently have 6-7
staff persons on hand already.  With the preparation of the Access DB for
contract validation today, alongside our already available set of contracts,
there will be plenty of data entry and validation work to do.

Please contact me if there are any other topics you wish to discuss.  I can
be reached by any means as listed below.

Josh,
Thanks for the update.  Please include Steven Fisher on all
communication related to the project.  He is leading this project from
Enron's side.  Just a few questions/comments:
- Steven is in the process of finalizing necessary fields.  Our plan is
to go through a few contracts ourselves to ensure we are not missing
anything before you guys ramp up.
- Who is Scott Watson?  
- How many contracts do we think we have? I may have an EES resource to
help track down contracts.  
- Let's just make sure we have enough contracts/work to keep that many
people busy.  I'm doubtful that we do at this point.
Thanks again,
Kristin





Kristin -

I just wanted to drop you a line since my last email communication last
week
to give you a status on our current activities for the Power Contract
Validation/Reconciliation Project.

1.	The Access Database that will be used for the validation and
reconciliation processes is 70% complete.  Our estimate is about 1.5-2
days
for completion.  The main issue slowing the development process is that
we
are still trying to identify all of the required fields for a complete
Power
contract.  After doing so, we will need to go back to the folks working
with
Scott Mills to do another RPS data extraction.
2.	Toby Ellis' group has been working to gather paper contracts
from
the Legal Dep't, CSC, and Origination so that we have all of the sources
necessary for validation and reconciliation.  As further contracts are
generated and/or located, they are copied and on a daily basis, we are
to
meet with Scott Watson mid-afternoon for ongoing collection.
4.	Leveraging the experiences of the Gas Project, we are currently
documenting the processes and procedures that the staff personnel will
use
to actually execute the validation and reconciliation procedures.  This
should ensure a smooth transition for them.  I will look for Chris',
Murray's, and your recommendations for these at some point by end of
week.
5.	We are currently ramping up the staff involved with this
project.
By week-end, we should have about 7-8 staff personnel on board.  Finding
a
physical location for everyone will be difficult.  Murray O'Neil, Chris
Stokley, and one of the office managers in 3 Allen are aware of this
need
and its urgency, and are working with me to arrange the space.

Please let me know if you have any questions about the above.  I can be
reached at any of the numbers/locations below.  Thanks.

Paige,

Kenny said you would be the contact to clarify on settlement date.  We have
seen some settlement language in the contracts stating that settlement is
done quarterly.

As of now, we added it into our form and are capturing the term if it is
stated.  Is there anything else you know that we should be capturing
regarding the settlement date?

Thanks,

Annie

Kristin -

I just wanted to drop you a line since my last email communication last week
to give you a status on our current activities for the Power Contract
Validation/Reconciliation Project.

1.	The Access Database that will be used for the validation and
reconciliation processes is 70% complete.  Our estimate is about 1.5-2 days
for completion.  The main issue slowing the development process is that we
are still trying to identify all of the required fields for a complete Power
contract.  After doing so, we will need to go back to the folks working with
Scott Mills to do another RPS data extraction.
2.	Toby Ellis' group has been working to gather paper contracts from
the Legal Dep't, CSC, and Origination so that we have all of the sources
necessary for validation and reconciliation.  As further contracts are
generated and/or located, they are copied and on a daily basis, we are to
meet with Scott Watson mid-afternoon for ongoing collection.
4.	Leveraging the experiences of the Gas Project, we are currently
documenting the processes and procedures that the staff personnel will use
to actually execute the validation and reconciliation procedures.  This
should ensure a smooth transition for them.  I will look for Chris',
Murray's, and your recommendations for these at some point by end of week.
5.	We are currently ramping up the staff involved with this project.
By week-end, we should have about 7-8 staff personnel on board.  Finding a
physical location for everyone will be difficult.  Murray O'Neil, Chris
Stokley, and one of the office managers in 3 Allen are aware of this need
and its urgency, and are working with me to arrange the space.

Please let me know if you have any questions about the above.  I can be
reached at any of the numbers/locations below.  Thanks.

Murray/Chris -

Attached is an Excel spreadsheet with the breakdown of the CSC-extracted
power data.  You will find that the majority (~70%) of the contracts are
PG&E or Southern California Edison Co.  Additionally, we noted that 144 of
the deals have repeats, with varying numbers of repeats by each account, and
resulting in 305 records with non-distinct account numbers.  These numbers
are listed in the last four pages of the report.  We have not determined the
reason some of the account numbers are repeated.

The data extracted from CSC includes the following fields:

ENTITY (LoadStar, EESI, etc.)
POWERLINE_CUSTOMER_NAME
ENRON_ACCT_NUMBER
POWERLINE_DEAL_NAME
CUSTOMER_TYPE (Residential, Commercial)
OPCO_CODE (Operating Company Code?)
PES_INVOICE_DATE
SERVICE_PERIOD_START
SERVICE_PERIOD_STOP
TOTAL_CHARGES
TOTAL_USAGE
UOM (?)
FLAG (?)
SERVICE_CODE (Status)

We are in the process of identifying the main contact at CSC to describe the
data to us, as some of the fields (e.g., those with ?'s above) contain
values that we are not familiar with or that exhibit some non-clarity.  For
example, in the Status section of the summary report, you will notice some
"DE-ACTIVE", "CANCELLED", and "CLOSED" types, which seem all to be the same
or quite similar in nature.  We want to make sure that we understand these
values and where they come from in order to work with the data.

Please review my report, and let me know if you have any questions.  As I
continue to work with the data, I will be able to speak to these.  Thanks.

Kristin -

As per our discussion yesterday, I am writing give you a status on the
Access Tool we are building for the Power Deal Validation and Reconciliation
processes.  We have taken the Gas Tool's model, and begun to modify it to
suit the activities planned for Power deals.  This work has focused thus far
on the look-and-feel of the tool, with work on the data and performance
factors promptly following, scheduled for completion by early next week. 
T
 he modification process has also considered some additional Power deal
required data, which were not necessary for Gas.  Also, in consideration of
the initiative where we will work to calculate/correct the settlement
amounts on the deals, we have developed a billing section.  In this section
we hope to leverage paper contract, CSC, and RPS validated and reconciled
deal information to pump through a calculation engine for said settlements.

Please take a look at the attachment, which includes screen shots of the
main sections of the tool so far.  The screens developed are mostly useful
for the validation and reconciliation activities, although others are
pending modification or development, as needed.  We hope to use your
feedback for tweaking the screens.

Thanks for the time and I hope you enjoy your weekend.

Chris -

We have gathered the information from the Gas Team as to what the procedures
are for rounding up contracts.  These details are illustrated in the
attached PowerPoint presentation.  I am assuming that the Gas approach will
serve as the basic model of the Power roundup activities, with minor
adjustments, depending on such things as regions, number of contracts, and
the like.  Please take a look at the slides and give me any feedback you
feel necessary.  Today, we will be working to establish communication lines
with the listed contacts, as well as determining contact points where holes
exist.

Also in the presentation is a slide describing the procedures for
controlling paper documentation for new contracts.  As you'll recall, the
Gas group has established a new process for capturing deal information,
something that has been in place since end of July.  Given the fact that the
RGS system is still live during the contract review process, however,
another review will have to be executed at some future point in time in
order to cover any new deals being incepted.  Your feedback on an approach
to handling this for Power deals will also be valuable.

Thanks and have a good weekend.
