Hello Dana,

 I trust that all is well for you and yours.  I'm e-mailing you to get a
message to Kevin for me about Lay Speaker's School.  As Kevin may be
aware there is a two year membership rule within the book of discipline
before an individual can apply for the ordained ministry within the
United Methodist connection.  Until such time that he has been a member
for  two years he may want to attend the Lay Speaker's School on March
17th and 25th that will give him some training in some strategic areas of
ministry that will provide him with some additional tools to use in his
quest for the ministry.
 If he is interested please ask him to contact me for more information.
I've been meaning to tell him directly but everytime we are together I
forget about it.  So since I'm at the computer I decided to e-mail you so
that you can remember (smile).
 Thanks for everything!

Hey Joe!  Fat Chance about you being kicked off the anniversary committee 
cause if you go, I GO!  

Not very many people showed up for the meeting.  Grace, Pastor, Kevin, 
Carolyn, Mother Jackson and I were there. Not a whole lot of decisions were 
made;  mostly we just gave Grace an update on what we discussed last 
Wednesday.  

"DON'T QUOTE ME"
Mass mailing to all churches is our area as well as some selected churches 
outside our area  such as Windsor Village, Mount Vernon, St. Agnes, Abundant 
Life, Good Hope, Lakewood and Memorial. Target date: Nov. 15th and Dec. 1 cut 
off

Curtis spoke to Shaun McLemore yesterday?.  He said something about having 
nice and lengthy conversation with him regarding some CD.  Like I said "DON'T 
QUOTE ME"   but Shaun was OK with it as long as there would be no 
reproduction of it to make a profit.  That's all I can remember now.  I'll 
see you tonight at choir rehearsal.

		Positive Living Tip of the Day
		Monday January 29, 2001
		
		Your Environment  
		
		Do you live or work in an environment that creates undue stress in your life?
		
		If so, realize your environment plays an important role in your life. Hostile 
environments create defensiveness, and an individual's negative behavior can 
directly affect others who are trying to maintain a healthy attitude.
		
		For example, if you are working with a supervisor who constantly berates 
those under him/her in front of others, this negative behavior affects 
everyone in the office. And hanging around negative friends and family 
members can reinforce your own negative traits. (For example, your temper is 
under control as long as you are not around your older brother.) In addition, 
negative people can induce others into developing the same negative attitudes 
and behaviors that they possess. It is true the company you keep is a 
reflection on you and can influence your behavior. Steer clear of negative 
environments and begin building a positive life.

That sounds nice but if we continue to make programs for M.O.P.,  I would 
like to use the short ones.





Hey what do you think of this one, I even thought we  could give what ever
ones you won't use for the church's programs on Sunday.

>
>   I read of a man who stood to speak
>  At the funeral of a friend.
>  He referred to the dates on her tombstone
>  From the beginning...to the end.
>  He noted that first came her date of birth
>  And spoke the following date with tears,
>  But he said what mattered most of all
>  Was the dash between those years. (l900-l970)
>
>  For that dash represents all the time
>  That she spent alive on earth...
>  And now only those who loved her
>  Know what that little line is worth.
>  For it matters not, how much we own;
>  The cars...the house...the cash,
>  What matters is how we live and love
>  And how we spend our dash.
>
>  So think about this long and hard...
>  Are there things you'd like to change?
>  For you never know how much time is left,
>  That can still be rearranged.
>  If we could just slow down enough
>  To consider what's true and real,
>  And always try to understand
>  The way other people feel.
>
>  And be less quick to anger,
>  And show appreciation more
>  And love the people in our lives
>  Like we've never loved before.
>  If we treat each other with respect,
>  And more often wear a smile...
>  Remembering that this special dash
>  Might only last a little while.
>
>  So, when your eulogy's being read
>  With your life's actions to rehash...
>  Would you be proud of the things they say
>  About how you spent your dash?

> Makes a lot of Sense.

information, what day and time is your group fasting?

I'm sorry if you misunderstood me, but what I was trying to convey was that
Rev. Jacque ask that we communicate with our assigned organized group
by-way of calling three way every Tuesday night if possible and to lift up
the concerns that was given to us in the hand-outs and also anything else
that God lays on our heart.

The time that you have set aside for fasting sounds great. Rev. Jacque
mentioned in the last meeting that we would discuss a time for all so that
we could be on one accord. I think what Rev Jacque wants most for all of us
is to start communicating and being on one accord even when we're not
assembled together on Monday night.

 I would think that if we're praying on Tuesday's and fasting on
Wednesday's, there will be some definite strongholds torn down. What do you
think?

I have already asked my team members to block out every Wednesday morning
from 8am to 12pm for our fast time and it was feasible for all (Bonnie,
myself, Cheryl S. & Betty).  If we need to change our time to comply with
all the members of the prayer ministry, let me know and I will get the word
out.

God Bless All

Matthew 18:20 states "For where two or three are gathered together in My
name, I am there in the midst of them".

Greeting My Dear Sisters In Christ,

It has been suggested by our Prayer Ministry Leader that we establish a
common time for our Organized Units to pray. It seems as though Tuesday
night at 9:30 pm would be the  most convenient, at this present time.

It is my discernment that tonight should be our starting date. Please make
every attempt to comply with this endeavor in order that we may attack the
strongholds and be unified in  the body of Christ.

If this is not conducive for your schedule please suggest an alternative.

Be Blessed
Edith:-)

Subject: ISO-NE failure to mitigate ICAP market -- Release of ISO NE 
confidential information



The New England Conference of Public Utilities Commissioners (NECUPUC) filed 
an Answer if Support of the Motion of the Maine Public Utilities Commission 
for Disclosure of Information.
NECUPUC supports the request for the release of the unredacted copies of 
ISO-NE's September 21, 2000 Answer in this case.  In the alternative, they 
would ask that the Commission provide to the regulators that are parties to 
the proceeding unredacted copies of the ISO's September 21, 2000 Answer 
subject to an appropriate protective order.



Duke Energy North America (DENA) filed an Answer that opposes the MPUC 
request for public information.

DENA argues that only a  three month lag in the release of confidential 
information is impermissible under a prior FERC ruling in the NSTAR Services 
Co. case which set out a six-month lag rule for the release of information.
Their second argument was that the request seeks information for all NEPOOL 
markets and not just the ICAP market which is subject to the suit.
If the FERC authorizes the release of confidential information, then it 
should be subject to a protective order which contains the following:
The information may only be used for the purposes of this docket.
Only specifically named "reviewing Reps associated with the MPUC may review 
the information.
The confidential materials may not be removed from the NE-ISO's premises.
The reviewing rep must execute a nondisclosure certificate.


Answer to the MPUC's Motion for Disclosure of Information from Northeast 
Utilities Service Company and Select Energy and request for expedited 
commission action.  NUSCO and Select Energy Support MPUC's request for 
disclosure of information that the ISO has filed under seal, but opposes the 
selective disclosure of this information to the MPUC and other regulatory 
commissions and not other participants.   NUSCO and Select Energy request 
expedited action due the financial implications and there is also 
considerable uncertainty regarding prices in the residual ICAP market in 
January, February and March of 2000 due to the suspended settlement pending 
Commission guidance.

Subject: ACT: New DSS Change Password Procedure  



To All DSS Users,

Currently there is no mechanism for changing your password on DSS.  

On May 15, 2000, we will be putting a new procedure into effect that will 
function similarly to the LAN change password procedure.  Passwords for DSS 
users will begin to expire in early June, and every 60 days thereafter.  You 
will be receiving 5 Password Expiration e-mails as the deadline approaches.  
Each of these messages will notify you that your DSS password will expire in 
the specified time interval.

These e-mails will be sent as follows:
E-mail  #1 - 2 weeks before expiration date
 #2 - 1 week before expiration date
 #3 - 2 days before expiration date
 #4 - 1 day before expiration date
 #5 - The day the password expires

We now have a new module that will allow you to change your password.  When 
this module is executed, a window will display which will prompt you for your 
current password, New password, and repeat New password.  There are certain 
criteria that the new password must meet for it to successfully change.  
Follow the instructions on this window to choose a new password.  You may run 
this module anytime, but once you change your password, the module must be 
closed before it can be run again.

Please Detach (double-click) the following module and save it in the location 
that you normally save your DSS modules/databases.  This may be on your hard 
(C:) drive or personal (H:) drive.  As long as you remember where it is, it 
really doesn't matter where you save it.  When the time comes, Execute 
(double-click) the module to change your DSS password.





If you have any questions or problems, please call the DSS HelpDesk at 
x31555, option 6 OR Lotus Notes e-mail at GPG DSS.

Thank you.

Good Morning My Sisters In Christ,

I am writing you on behalf of a bridal shower that my sister wants to give me
on Dec. 2nd at 6:30 pm. I want to extend an invitation to all of you who are
interested in coming. For those of you that would be interested, I will need
your address forwarded to Kathy (my sister) and copy me. Her email address is
 kathy-lacy@reliantenergy.com and you can copy me here to my my home email
address. I would also appreciate it if you would get the word out to others
that do not have email and to others that might be interested in coming. I
was asked to get this information 2 weeks ago but I have been on the run so

Hey, Dana - 

I hope your Friday is going well.  When you have a chance on Tuesday, can you 
tell me if these have come across your desk yet?  I think the $460k was wired 
on Wed, 2/14.

Thanks for your help.  Have a nice holiday weekend!

I will not be at the meeting tonight me and Curtis are going to Good Hope
Church to meet with Shaun.  Will you let them know about the DJ from KSBJ,
and also Curtis was able to also confirm the former radio announcer from
KTSU Dewayne B. Cook. We may want to use both of them, or just one, the
committee needs to decide.  Let Bonnie know about the letterhead
confirmation so she can get that out to KSBJ.  I thought is we really should
utilize the DJ from KSBJ!  Thanks Dana talk to you later!  Grace

An application called AP Data Viewer.  Accounts payable uses it to retrieve 
status on document such as invoice payments, wires, payment requests, etc....

I've just spoken to Pam and I think I'm requesting the right thing but using 
the wrong form.  Will you please reject this so I can start all over?

Subject: prayer


I am writing to each of you because I need you to be in prayer with me
this week.

For the past two months, I have been going to the doctor, because of a
lump I found
under my arm.  As a result of that I have had to have a mammogram and an
ultrasound of
my breast.  Both test came back abnormal and  I am seeing a specialist
this week to
determine if I need to have a biopsy or not.

Since God has given me the task of
doing a mighty work for him the devil has been busy.

I trust and believe that God will heal.  God gave me a revelation several
months
ago that ALL IS WELL since that time, my husband and I have reunited our
family,
we have been blessed tremendously in more ways than I can share with you
at
this time, however, in the midst of those blessings, the devil has gotten
mad.  So he
has decided to try and pull me down once again.  I refuse to be brought
down off this
spiritual high that is truly a blessing from God.

That is why I am calling on all you prayer warriors
I need you to be in prayer with me this week.  I see the specialist on
Thursday
and I will know then if I need to have the biopsy.

God Bless Each of you
and
Season's Greetings

Love

Marylyn

Thanks for your response.  Brian Dawson had them.  
FYI...per Brian's question/suggestions I will be implementing a file check 
out policy procedure for our files that will help control their whereabouts.  
Starting with the E-schedules and tax files there will be an additional 
hanging file folder inside the cabinet with sign out forms inside.  Everyone 
will be expected to govern themselves accordingly for file usage.  Thanks for 
your cooperation.

Hey:

We get these newsletters in our apartments every month and there is
always a
brain teaser on the back side of it.  This was the one for this month:

Let's see how well you will do.

For every question, tell me who this person is, not their names, but
their
relationship to you. (eg. cousin, aunt, great-grandma, etc.)


1.  Who is your father's, uncle's, brother's sister?

2.  Who is your aunt's mother's, father's, wife?

3.  Who is your mother's, nephew's, daughter's son?

4.  Who is your brother's, son's, sister's mother?

5.  Who is your sister-in-law's, father-in-law's grandson?

6.  Who is your sister's, father's, step-son's mother?

7.  Who is your uncle's, father's, grandchild?

Make an honest attempt, and then scroll down for the answers...

I think I need to take a half day of vacation Friday, Oct. 20th.  I am 
involved in some church activities next weekend and I won't find out if I 
need this time off until tonight or Wednesday night.  Is that too short of 
notice?

I'm sorry if you misunderstood me, but what I was trying to convey was that
Rev. Jacque ask that we communicate with our assigned organized group
by-way of calling three way every Tuesday night if possible and to lift up
the concerns that was given to us in the hand-outs and also anything else
that God lays on our heart.

The time that you have set aside for fasting sounds great. Rev. Jacque
mentioned in the last meeting that we would discuss a time for all so that
we could be on one accord. I think what Rev Jacque wants most for all of us
is to start communicating and being on one accord even when we're not
assembled together on Monday night.

 I would think that if we're praying on Tuesday's and fasting on
Wednesday's, there will be some definite strongholds torn down. What do you
think?

Matthew 18:20 states "For where two or three are gathered together in My
name, I am there in the midst of them".

Greeting My Dear Sisters In Christ,

It has been suggested by our Prayer Ministry Leader that we establish a
common time for our Organized Units to pray. It seems as though Tuesday
night at 9:30 pm would be the  most convenient, at this present time.

It is my discernment that tonight should be our starting date. Please make
every attempt to comply with this endeavor in order that we may attack the
strongholds and be unified in  the body of Christ.

If this is not conducive for your schedule please suggest an alternative.

Be Blessed
Edith:-)

Claudette, Dana & Carolyn,

    Sending this e-mail to remind you of the revival at Shaw Tabernacle UMC
on Friday at 7:30 pm.  The directions are 45S or 59S to 610E.  601E to
Wayside.  Exit Wayside and turn left under 610.   Take Wayside to Birmingham
and turn right on Birmingham.  Birmingham dead ends into the church.  Try
and be there on time, because the church fills up pretty quickly.

    Also remember the Seeds of Praise workshop on Saturday from 9:00 am to
2:00 pm at Mt. Corinth UMC in Humble. Take 1960 towards Humble.  Take the
"Y" in the road when going into Humble onto Old Humble Road.  The church is
about 1 to 1 1/2 miles down on the right.  If you pass Super K-Mart on the
left, turn around you have gone to far.  Breakfast will be served promptly
at 9:00 am.  I have already paid for all members going from Veterans, so we
can settle up later.

    Don't forget the picnic is on Sunday after service.  If you haven't
signed up to bring anything contact Danise Johnson to see what is still
needed.

    If you need any other info, please contact me:  (281)872-1197 Home

(713)696-6878 Work

(832)567-8674 Cell

(713)605-2405 Pager

Be Blessed,

Hi Denise,

I really appreciate your note - and yes, it will be great and a tremendous
BLESSING to see my sisters in Jesus... I will place that on my calendar; I
generally take some time off that time of the year, so I will be looking
forward to it.  What a wonderful celebration it will be... Since I live so
far; no one really has to help me; but if they want to, it would be greatly
appreciated; but mostly I hope that lots of ladies come... When you told me
that y'all eat anything, that's fine with me; just let me know a few days in
advance, how many people you think will be coming and I'll be ready...I love
to have people come together in my home... it will be a blessing...

There are several reasons that I'm not available lately - the main one being
of course, I'm working approximately 12-15 hours a day - it is a very trying
time for me right now and I need all the prayers that I can get; please
continue to do that; the other reason is; I'm physically tired; I'm 53 years
old and have been having lots of responsibility for most of my adult years!

I was been blessed to be able to come back to Houston 12 years ago and was
afforded an opportunity to buy a new home and was at that time within 15
minutes of my job (not anymore); hence I live "quite" a ways from church -
by distance approximately 38 mi.; by time depending on whose doing the
driving(smiles) and which way you come approximately 45 min. So after years
and years of having to drive so far at least 6 days a week, I'm tired...

God bless you and the Women's Ministry for thinking of me and my family at
such a special time in any Christian's life and I look forward to the
fellowship.  Keep me posted.

Love and God's grace to you,
Ruby

Good Morning Ruby,

     I hope God has found favor with you this morning.  I have a request of
you.  I don't know if you remember in May when we talked about having a
women's ministry meeting at your home.  Well, we met briefly last night and
we are requesting that you, your mother, and aunt allow us to come and share
with you during the Christmas holiday.  We would like you to co-host the
meeting in December.  We are looking for a Saturday, due to Pastor Wallace
having class on Sunday's now.  We would like to know if you would be willing
to co-host on December 16.  The reason I say co-host, is we always partner
up with someone.  And we want to afford you the same opportunity.

     Our meetings generally consists of prayer, praise and worship.  We
sing, do bible study and just fellowship with one another.  During
Christmas, we also do a gift exchange.  We buy one $10 gift for no one in
particular, put numbers on them and them draw the numbers out of a hat.

     We thought the celebration of our Savior's birth would be a good time
to come and pray with and for your family.  Please let me know.  I hope to
see you soon.  We really have been missing you.

Be Blessed,
Denise

There will be 3 vans downstairs on Thursday, Dec. 14 that will be 
transporting sponsors every 15-20 minutes starting at 10am.  We should try to 
be there at least 30 minues before our 1st break (11:39), so let's try to 
leave around 11am-ish?

Good morning ladies,

     The ballet is still on for Tuesday.  I had originally planned to pick
up each girl, however, I am on special assignment on the Southwest side of
time.  So, if you would, please have take them to Carolyn Ashley's house by
6:15 pm.  The ballet begins at 7:30 pm.  If they are not able to go, please
let me know, so I can make arrangements to take another girl.

Denise

Marnie -

I think I need to take a half day of vacation Friday, Oct. 20th.  I am 
involved in some church activities next weekend and I won't find out if I 
need this time off until tonight or Wednesday night.  Is that too short of 
notice?

Subject: Manual JE info for cutover weekend

Attached is the template to be used for inputting manual FI and CS journal 
entries for cutover weekend.  The template will be used for both June 
Hyperion entries that were made and need to be input into SAP for June, as 
well as for any manual entries that didn't get into June MSA or Hyperion but 
need to be reflected in SAP for June (an example would be an intercompany 
imbalance that didn't get corrected by June in Hyperion).  There are some 
Hyperion entries that were made in June that shouldn't go into SAP, such as 
entries that were made to record equity earnings in consolidated subs.  These 
specific entries were made for tax reasons, but going forward, SAP will 
record these entries automatically.  If you have any questions about whether 
or not a Hyperion entry should be included in SAP, please contact me or Cindy 
Morrow.

There will be a box in Cindy Morrow's office to drop off any entries that 
need to be made.  We are requesting all manual entries converted from June 
Hyperion entries to be dropped off no later than noon on Thursday.  This will 
allow time for the SAP team to key in the entries prior to Saturday so the 
data will be in SAP when we get to work on Saturday morning.  Please include 
copies of the Hyperion entries and any other support with the SAP manual 
entries.  For any other entries that need to be made this weekend, we are 
requesting these to be dropped off as soon as possible after the Hyperion 
entries are converted and complete.

I will be available the remainder of the week to assist anyone who needs help 
converting Hyperion entries to SAP, or preparing an entry that hasn't been 
reflected in either MSA or Hyperion as of June but you would like included in 
SAP for June.  Please call me or email me to set up a time.

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Pam

I will be taking a 1/2 day of vacation on Friday.  I am trying to do the 
majority of the necessary preparation for our trip before Friday.  I am also 
still trying to decide whether or not we will do hair tonight.  Do you 
already have the perm?  I did get some type of directions from Denise too.  I 
am printing them now and placing them in my purse so we will have them.

I've been here since 8:30am but my computer was very slow booting up and 
after it came on I couldn't get a connection to lotus notes.  I put in a call 
to Jimmy Manguba, our floor tech, while waiting for my computer to reboot.  I 
don't know what the problem was but this seemed to work.

Good Morning Marnie -

Yesterday I made a dental appt. for Monday, Dec. 11th @ 5pm but I need to 
leave at 4pm to get there on time.  I have to finish a root canal that was 
started several months ago.  Do you foresee a problem with me leaving at 4pm 
that day?

Some of the accountants have been able to flag a few items that can be 
archived but it has only been a very little.  Most of them are asking the 
same question.  They want to know if there will be file cabinet space to 
store the items that they are  not ready to send to archive but have no room 
to store on their desks?  This is placing a hold on the archiving project 
because I can't archive anything that the accountants won't give me the go 
ahead on and quite frankly,  this is nearly everything I touch.  Please 
help.  Maybe if they knew where their things were going to be stored,  I 
could at least help box it up for them to move with them.  Thanks.

Rufino,

Please see the list I have started for SAP accrual entries.  If you think it 
will speed up the process or make the list complete, please work with Dana.  
Let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks as always,

Marnie -

I think I need to take a half day of vacation Friday, Oct. 20th.  I am 
involved in some church activities next weekend and I won't find out if I 
need this time off until tonight or Wednesday night.  Is that too short of 
notice?

HI.  I'm so overwhelmed at the goodness of God.  Know ye not that it's the 
goodness of God that leads a man to repent.  I feel like I just got a new 
boyfriend that I want to spend all my time with.  Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Ok-Ok.  
I just wanted to share a scripture with you girls.  

Hebrews 4:12 - 
For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged 
sword, 
piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints 
and 
marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.

I'm so excited and encouraged to continue in this race.  I'm so thankful that 
God is teaching me through you and His Word that this race is not given to 
the swift, 
neither to strong but to the one that endures to the end.  Keep pressing my 
sisters!

Love You,

Dana

I forgot to give you money for parking I am so embarrased and sorry.  I'll

1pm to 2pm today so if you call or email me within those time frames and I 
don't respond for a while, that's why.

Greeting My Sisters In Christ,

I was just touching basis with the both of you as frontliners to say that
we are blessed and highly favored in the eyes of  God. On last night, the
group participated in a three-way and it was a blessing and it was agreed
on last night that we too would be participating in the fast on Wednesday
as well.

We all agreed to do the fast with water only, because we know that there
are different kinds of fast and I wasn't sure what others were doing, but
my feeling is that whatever we do as a unit and as long as we are doing it
to the Glory and Honor of God, then He honors what's in our hearts.

I believe that this is only the beginning of change and that God is truly
doing a new thing in the saints of God. The fast was a blessing for me on
today. I got up this morning with a spirit of expectation, not knowing what
to expect, but knowing that God was doing something powerful in the spirit
realm.

I believe that as we continue to walk in unity, keep our focus, commit our
work unto Him, that God will establish our thoughts and He will complete
that which He has started in us....A good work.

Be blessed :-)
Edith

Marnie -

I think I need to take a half day of vacation Friday, Oct. 20th.  I am 
involved in some church activities next weekend and I won't find out if I 
need this time off until tonight or Wednesday night.  Is that too short of 
notice?

No choir rehearsal tonight.  The Winds of Change" choir from the prison will
be singing.  Don't forget we go to Mt. Corinth Sunday afternoon at 3:30 with
Pastor Wallace.  That's Rev. Lisa's church in Humble.

Greeting My Sisters In Christ,

I was just touching basis with the both of you as frontliners to say that
we are blessed and highly favored in the eyes of  God. On last night, the
group participated in a three-way and it was a blessing and it was agreed
on last night that we too would be participating in the fast on Wednesday
as well.

We all agreed to do the fast with water only, because we know that there
are different kinds of fast and I wasn't sure what others were doing, but
my feeling is that whatever we do as a unit and as long as we are doing it
to the Glory and Honor of God, then He honors what's in our hearts.

I believe that this is only the beginning of change and that God is truly
doing a new thing in the saints of God. The fast was a blessing for me on
today. I got up this morning with a spirit of expectation, not knowing what
to expect, but knowing that God was doing something powerful in the spirit
realm.

I believe that as we continue to walk in unity, keep our focus, commit our
work unto Him, that God will establish our thoughts and He will complete
that which He has started in us....A good work.

Be blessed :-)
Edith

Dana, If you need help preparing for the trip please let me know.
As far as the hair thing I have to have mine done tonight for sure,
tomorrow is bible study, Thursday Chanel has a class, she'll already
miss Saturday because they will be out of town, so if you can't do it for me
let me know
believe me I understand. It's just convenient because you're right there,
plus those lil-nubs
do a wondrous job. Oh! please let me have a copy of the directions for
back-up just in case
we'll have an extra one. Please advise :>

I will be taking a 1/2 day of vacation on Friday.  I am trying to do the
majority of the necessary preparation for our trip before Friday.  I am
also still trying to decide whether or not we will do hair tonight.  Do you
already have the perm?  I did get some type of directions from Denise too.
I am printing them now and placing them in my purse so we will have them.

all the MOP members names, addresses and phone #'s.  I plan to revise it more 
with email addresses and alternate/emergency phone #'s but for now will you 
help me fill in the blanks where possible?  Later, if every one approves, we

Claudette, Dana & Carolyn,

    Sending this e-mail to remind you of the revival at Shaw Tabernacle UMC
on Friday at 7:30 pm.  The directions are 45S or 59S to 610E.  601E to
Wayside.  Exit Wayside and turn left under 610.   Take Wayside to Birmingham
and turn right on Birmingham.  Birmingham dead ends into the church.  Try
and be there on time, because the church fills up pretty quickly.

    Also remember the Seeds of Praise workshop on Saturday from 9:00 am to
2:00 pm at Mt. Corinth UMC in Humble. Take 1960 towards Humble.  Take the
"Y" in the road when going into Humble onto Old Humble Road.  The church is
about 1 to 1 1/2 miles down on the right.  If you pass Super K-Mart on the
left, turn around you have gone to far.  Breakfast will be served promptly
at 9:00 am.  I have already paid for all members going from Veterans, so we
can settle up later.

    Don't forget the picnic is on Sunday after service.  If you haven't
signed up to bring anything contact Danise Johnson to see what is still
needed.

    If you need any other info, please contact me:  (281)872-1197 Home

(713)696-6878 Work

Davette, 
Greeting to you in the name of my Lord and Savior Jesus!  This is the letter 
that I spoke of that  was sent to me this morning from one of the ladies at 
my church.  She also forwarded this message to several other women outside of 
our church.  I want you to read it because I believe that it will encourage 
you to trust God if you are not and hold tight if you are because the 
effectual fervent prayers of the righteous do avail much.  Like I breifly 
stated earlier, I will have my prayer ministry group pray for you tonight and 
we will keep on praying for you until I hear you tell me ALL is well.  We try 
to meet every Monday night to pray over special prayer request that we have 
received along with praying for the needs our families, friends, church, 
government and even our enemies.  Our meeting start at 7pm but we really 
don't get started praying until 8pm so if you want to touch and agree with us 
around that time that would be great.  We're all in this together if you hurt 
we hurt. : )


I am writing to each of you because I need you to be in prayer with me
this week.

For the past two months, I have been going to the doctor, because of a
lump I found
under my arm.  As a result of that I have had to have a mammogram and an
ultrasound of
my breast.  Both test came back abnormal and  I am seeing a specialist
this week to
determine if I need to have a biopsy or not.

Since God has given me the task of
doing a mighty work for him the devil has been busy.

I trust and believe that God will heal.  God gave me a revelation several
months
ago that ALL IS WELL since that time, my husband and I have reunited our
family,
we have been blessed tremendously in more ways than I can share with you
at
this time, however, in the midst of those blessings, the devil has gotten
mad.  So he
has decided to try and pull me down once again.  I refuse to be brought
down off this
spiritual high that is truly a blessing from God.

That is why I am calling on all you prayer warriors
I need you to be in prayer with me this week.  I see the specialist on
Thursday
and I will know then if I need to have the biopsy.

God Bless Each of you
and
Season's Greetings

Love

Marylyn

One day in the Garden of Eden, Eve calls out to God.  "Father, I have a
problem!"

 "What's the problem, Eve?"

 "Lord, I know you created me and provided this beautiful garden and
all of  these wonderful animals and that hilarious comedic snake, but
I'm
just not  happy."

"Why is that, Eve?" came the reply from above.

"Lord, I am lonely, and I'm sick to death of apples."

"Well Eve, in that case, I have a solution.  I shall create a man for
you."

"What's a man, Lord?"

"This man will be a flawed creature, with many bad traits.  He'll lie,
cheat and be vainglorious; all in all, he'll give you a hard time.
But...he'll be bigger, faster, and will like to hunt and kill things.
He will look silly when he's aroused, but since you've been complaining,
I'll create him in such a way that he will satisfy your physical needs.
He will be witless and will revel in childish things like fighting and
kicking a ball about.  He  won't be too smart, so he'll also need your
advice to think
properly."

"Sounds great." says Eve, with an ironically raised eyebrow. " What's
the catch, Lord?"

"Well...  you can have him on one condition."

"What's that, Lord?"

"As I said, he'll be proud, arrogant, and self-admiring...  So you'll
have to let him believe that I made him first.  Just remember, it's our
little secret... Y'know....Woman to woman..."

Subject: Updated - Approval Authorizations

As mentioned in my previous memo regarding Cash Control Standards, approval 
authorizations are critical to our cash control environment.  Corporate 
Accounts Payable is actively pursuing a "Workflow" system to route invoice 
images for approval and processing.  This workflow solution will not be 
implemented until early 2001.  In the interim, an approval process will be 
implemented by AP and Treasury to ensure invoices have proper approvals and 
correct general ledger coding.  Effective Monday, November 20 the following 
approval authorizations will be required for all invoices, payment requests 
and wire transfer requests that are $1,000,000 or greater:

(A)  Those NOT approved by an underlying contract or RAC require two 
approvals:  a Managing Director approval of the payment, and an Accounting 
Director approval of the general ledger coding.  

(B)  Those that ARE approved by an underlying contract or RAC require an 
Accounting Director approval of the payment  and general ledger coding.

In both examples above, supporting documentation must be attached.  If not 
attached, then the payment will not be processed.

To assist us with implementing this approval process, I'm requesting each of 
you to accumulate signatures of the Managing Directors and Accounting 
Directors in your business unit using the attached form.  Please forward this 
information to Larry Dallman (JFR568) by Friday, November 10th.

This new process becomes effective Monday, November 20th.  It important to 
provide this information or payments greater than $1,000,000 will not be 
processed.

Hi Betty -
Hope this little note finds you doing well.  Didn't we have a wonderful time 
of fellowship last night.?  Claudette had such a fresh anointing on her.  She 
spoke so beautifully.

Listen, I have your email adress but not your phone #.  Is the some reason 
other than the fact that I've never asked?  You can reach me @ any of these 
#'s...

All,

      Here is the information on the blue jean shirts.  The exact price is
as follows:

M - XL         $22.65
XXL             $23.90
XXXL           $25.15

Please turn in your money to me as soon as possible.  The total for all the
shirts we have ordered is $551.  I have already made arrangements to pay for
half up front, due to such a high dollar order.

Pass the word on to those not on e-mail (Evelyn Morris, Evelyn Jackson, Nina
Nazir-ud-Din, Pamela Watts, Annette Richardson, Georgia Gillum, Danise
Johnson, Jackie Stewart, Marylyn Green, Ethel Ford, Cheryl Sumbler, and
Cheryl Curry). We need to try and have the money by Powertime on Wednesday.
If you need an accomodation, please let me know.

If you know of anyone else wanting a shirt, please get with me as soon as
possible.  I thought maybe the following might want a shirt (Rev Jacque,
Bobbie Poledore, Katherine Dailey, Valerie Piper).  It would be nice if all
women had one.

Also, thank Joe Stewart when you see him, for making all the arrangements
for us.

Thanks,
Denise

Lola -

You know that I wouldn't be asking you this but this is ONLY if  it's 
possible.  Some how I've gotten myself into a crunch and I need to know if I 
can get some money from you.  I'm not quite sure of what our balance is but 
is there any way I can get $40 or $50 from you?  My electric bill is $320 and 
it was due yesterday.  I called them and told them that I could pay half b/c 
my car note is due this pay period too.  Let me know if you can help.

Dear Friend,

A friend of yours, Bonnie Abraham, just took the Spiritual Gifts Analysis
Test at the Church Growth Institute web site. Your friend thought it was
very valuable and wanted to tell you about this unique FREE service!

Point your browser to the following web address, take the Spiritual Gifts
Analysis Test, and within minutes you'll know your dominant spiritual
gift and what you can do with it to minister to others. Here's the address:

http://www.teamministry.com/

I do hope you'll take advantage of this unique opportunity to learn about
yourself and how the Lord has gifted you!

Sincerely,

Larry Gilbert

President, Church Growth Institute

PS: Here's what your friend wanted to say to you:

Dana, Here is another inventory that I have taken in the past.
It's a very good one. Let me know what you think. BA

Good morning ladies,

     The ballet is still on for Tuesday.  I had originally planned to
pick
up each girl, however, I am on special assignment on the Southwest side
of
time.  So, if you would, please have take them to Carolyn Ashley's house
by
6:15 pm.  The ballet begins at 7:30 pm.  If they are not able to go,
please
let me know, so I can make arrangements to take another girl.

Denise

I didn't have a check off list of the ones that I made copies of and 
submitted but I do know for sure that I turned in Co.272.  Marnie worked on 
them late made a comment about that Co. having a lot of schedules.

Dana,
4th Qtr 2000?  I don't have them but I'm curious.  Were copies ever turned in 
to Keith Simper? 

Thanks,
Tammy

Who has the E-schedules for co. 1n2 and 272?  Marnie is looking for them and 
the aren't in the file cabinet.  Call me and I'll take them to her.

Thanks.

Dana

What is your problem?  Why aren't you responding to my emails?

Dorothy -

I spoke to Rebeka this morning regarding that administrative position.  I'm 
not quite sure how it went but I want to thank you for speaking to her on my 
behalf.  Although she is looking to fill this position within the next two 
weeks, she mentioned that if this didn't work out for me that she would 
forward my resume to the HR Recruiter, Dianne White.  And if I may ask,  just 
keep me in your prayers.  Thanks again.


Dana
