I received a call from Sarabeth Smith stating that as of 3:00 PM today (July 31) we have a signed agreement with Citizens.  The plant is not expected to come back on line until Thursday or Friday per Darrell.  Amy is coordinating a conference call with Craig Lipke to transition the transaction management to TW.  Darrell will notify Gas Control that we are taking over the monitoring of alarms and set point (flow/pressure) control.  I will coordinate the labor distribution for both Gas Control and Customer Service.  Collectively between the two groups we will be charging out $8,300 per month.

I want to express my thanks to Darrell, Dale, Terry, John and Amy for helping to put this deal together.  ( And of course the field personnel!)
Donna

Effective August 1, 2001, Enron Asset Management Resources will be acting as agent for the Citizens Communications Company at the Griffith interconnects on both Transwestern and El Paso.  I will be the primary scheduler in charge of communicating with the plant regarding its needs, confirming the gas at both interconnects, managing the OBA's, and allocating flows to the owners of the plant.

In order to ensure a smooth transition, I will probably be in close contact with each of you.  For the time being, we will use the burn estimates which come from the plant to determine our confirmed volumes on Transwestern and El Paso, as well as daily discussions we have with Duke, PPL, and our gas control.  In my absence, the rest of the Transwestern scheduling team will be trained to do the daily confirmations and work with gas control with regard to daily flows.

Thank you for all your cooperation.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call me.

Sincerely, 
Amy Mulligan
