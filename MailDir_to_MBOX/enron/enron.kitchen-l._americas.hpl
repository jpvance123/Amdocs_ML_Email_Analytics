Russell,
Thanks for the update.  Can you provide a rough quote/schedule to kit out the Louisiana space for 130 people - please contact Lillian Carroll to get an exact count.   We don't need recorded phones.  Also please lay out a schematic of the  hardware configuration between Enron, Louisiana and AEP's offices for this solution.

Deborah,
Can you provide Lillian with a floor plan so that she can start locating the HPL staff by function.  Also, what do you recommend regarding furniture?  We should be able to come up with an interim solution based on the space coming available in 3 Allen or any additional furniture we have in warehouses or in the Louisiana bldg.  Your thoughts on cost for this?

Once we have a plan/schedule I will follow up with AEP to let them know of our plans.  They already know we are headed in this direction, given their delay in leasing space.

Regards,
Brian

Subject:	Possible Temporary Move of HPL to 1201 Louisiana

I finished the walk through of the 15th floor space located at 1201 Louisiana this afternoon.  On the walk through with me were Paul Foust (facilities), Robert Humlicek, Jeffrey Vincent and Andrew Hawthorn.  I previously talked with Deborah Bubenko and Vincent Fox about this space.  Comments from the review are as follows:

Most of the floor is composed of offices with some large group areas (conference rooms etc.) included.  The floor can accommodate up to 150 people.  However, with this amount of people in the area, space will be VERY tight. Almost all offices will need to hold at least two people.  Large offices will need to hold three or four.  The larger areas will need to have cubicles installed to make complete use of the space.  With maximum doubling up in the offices, you might fit a couple of conference rooms on the floor with one kitchen area.  There are nooks just off some of the hallways that would accommodate several network printers.

As Tommy stated in his earlier e-mail on the Allen center space, the fire code will require us to put a strobe in each office with multiple occupants. 

One area of concern is the amount of furniture currently on the floor.  The floor plan shows approximately 90 desks on the floor.  Some offices were locked so we could not verify the total.  However,  this number appears correct.  Also, for the most part, there were only desks in the offices unless they were occupied.  Chairs, filing cabinets, credenzas, etc. would needed to be added to this space.  We need to determine where the additional furniture will come from. 

There is one large area with 11 cubicles forming a circle.  According to Paul, this was the area where telephones were answered for the previous tenant.  This might work for the trading area.  The room appears to have the most telephone connectivity, is open, and would accommodate up to 11.

If we decide trader telephones are necessary (record conversations etc.), the cost associated with the purchase of the equipment and the necessary installation time will need to be factored into our schedule.  

The floor has two data closets.  At least one of the closets has 24 hour air conditioning according to Vincent.  

This floor has the same server connectivity at the Three Allen Center space.  A 100 meg single mode fiber connection serves this space. 

Robert has informed me that the floor currently has switches to support up to 200 ports.  However, this does not mean that the drops to all offices are complete.  Probably some cabling will need to be added.  It appears that the space can accommodate up to 150 users even with the extra ports needed for network printers, laptops, etc.  However, if we need to accommodate more than 200 ports, additional switches can be added. 

In summary, the floor space at 1201 Louisiana looks as good or better than the space that was being considered at Three Allen Center.

Subject:	AEP Interest Payment vs. Coastline lawsuite costs

Louise,

I have developed the attached proposal that I would like to propose to AEP.  The basis of the proposal is that:

1.	 AEP would take on all costs, risks, liens, etc. associated with the Coastline law suite (low case $1.8MM, expected case $2.5MM).  

2.	Enron would forego 1 months of interest due to AEP's failure to get DoJ approval ($2.1MM).

Benefits to Enron:

1.	Potential savings in Enron expense vs. AEP's ability to capitalize the cost.

2.	Enron still retains the "DoJ stick" in that interest payments start on 1 June instead of 1 May.  

3.	Enron saves time and legal costs not having to defend against the claim.  

4.	Enron does not have to wrestle with AEP to get access to HPL staff who are involved in the suite.  (even though AEP is obligated to make resources available to help us with the claim, AEP will have no incentive to do so after the sale).    


Let me know if you have any objections or questions.

Brian

I talked with Anne Koehler in Legal today to determine her understanding of what is required from Energy Operations prior to the effective sale of HPL.  Anne believes that she may have been the one to introduce the term "protocol" into these discussions.  To clarify, according to Anne, the "protocol" is not anticipated to be a formal legal document.  Instead, Anne envisions simply e:mails or memos between Enron and AEP with regard to any sharing of information, agreements on processes to be followed in the transition, etc.  Operational details to be decided between Enron and AEP have been handled exactly in that manner to date, with e:mails being sent from Bob Ball (Enron) to Steve Jackson (AEP).  

Only critical changes to the Purchase and Sale Agreement will be formally documented.  Bob Hall identified the treatment of cash accounts in the original Purchase and Sale Agreement as incorrect relative to cash flows for gas to be delivered in the month of May.  He has worked with Enron's treasury group to establish the correct procedures and has worked with Sandi Braband in Legal to document this change to the Purchase and Sale Agreement as an Amendment to that agreement.   As of today, Legal has completed revisions to that amendment and Anne Koehler is sending it to Mary Perkins in Enron's Treasury group for her review.  Upon Mary's review, Anne will forward the amendment to AEP for their review before final signatures.  

We devised this week a new format for incorporating the AEP-HPL transition issues on which my team has been focused and have provided that to both of you.  This new format incorporates the various memos and e:mails which have to date captured the status of transition issues.  Items that only require actions by Enron will be our "to do" list.  Each item has a due date and we will update you weekly on progress.  Those items that fall under the AEP list or which appear in both the Enron and AEP list will be the items to which we will evidence communication to AEP and/or their agreement via the e:mails or memos as suggested by Ann Koehler.  I believe that this should satisfy your requests earlier this week for written "protocol".   We will also update you weekly on the status of those e:mails and/or memos between ourselves and AEP.  

I understand that the two of you have a regular weekly meeting for an update on the HPL sale.  To provide clarity for these update meetings, may I suggest that we incorporate one of the following two approaches: 

	1)  Brian and I hold a regular meeting just prior to your update meeting so that Brian has a full 		understanding of operational transition items and their status, or 

	2) I attend the first part of your update meeting in order to provide a firsthand update to the two of you.  

Please let me know which one of these works best for you so that we can incorporate that into our schedules for next week.

Team:

We are fast approaching our June 1 date to Close the HPL transaction.  A critical path items is to complete the unwind of the monetizations of HPL assets.  There are a number of converging activities that will require legal resources, so it is important that we clear out as many activities as possible so we don't reach legal gridlock at the end of May.

Tim Despain, can you lend your support to Ranabir/Shirley to move Hancock and Prudential to act?  Let me know if further resources/attention is needed.  Right now Hancock/Pru are the bottlenecks. 

Anne, I will call HCC and see where we are on unwinding the Project Rock meter monetization based on the documents you sent them.

Ranabir, can you prepare a schedule showing when we will have each monetization unwound and what the critical items/actions are for each.

Let me know if you need additional resources.  Lets get this done!

Thanks,
Brian

Thanks for the note.  I opposed the numbers issue, as well.  AEP is adamant about them being in there and Whalley, Redmond, and Colwell were fine with it.

First of all, congratulations.  I was afraid you were going to have your baby in the office.  My wife and I are getting some sleep, but as I'm sure you're experiencing, it comes in short doses.  I hope all is well for you.  Thanks for the flowers.  They were incredible!

It looks like EOL will have a full T1 link with AEP in place next week.  I will review this with Network Security and see if there are any issues.  AEP will still need to have their interfaces built and ready.  Enron should be ready to start testing our side by the end of this month and work out any issues in April.

I talked to Dawn Fournier about space in Three Allen and they are working on trying to free up a floor.  Currently there is not a whole floor available.  If they are successful then we will need to see what is currently set up on the floor and come up with the best plan for getting the space up and running ASAP.  To do so we may need to provide network and telephony services instead of waiting on AEP to build out their servers & install a phone switch.

Let me know if there are any questions.  -  Tommy

I am pretty sure that it is a full T1.  Hopefully the routing will be worked out next week.  The only thing left would be to make sure that the EOL business folks are OK with using it for this as well as the direct connect to EOL.

I will pass this by Bob Shults who is heading up this project.

AEP agrees with the idea that once we Close they would begin paying us "rent" for the space and furniture, but this would not recover all our costs.  I estimate a cost of $200k, but it is worth it to close early and save $6MM per month in labor, overhead and capital costs.

Russell,
Thanks for the update.  Can you provide a rough quote/schedule to kit out the Louisiana space for 130 people - please contact Lillian Carroll to get an exact count.   We don't need recorded phones.  Also please lay out a schematic of the  hardware configuration between Enron, Louisiana and AEP's offices for this solution.

Deborah,
Can you provide Lillian with a floor plan so that she can start locating the HPL staff by function.  Also, what do you recommend regarding furniture?  We should be able to come up with an interim solution based on the space coming available in 3 Allen or any additional furniture we have in warehouses or in the Louisiana bldg.  Your thoughts on cost for this?

Once we have a plan/schedule I will follow up with AEP to let them know of our plans.  They already know we are headed in this direction, given their delay in leasing space.

Regards,
Brian

Subject:	Possible Temporary Move of HPL to 1201 Louisiana

I finished the walk through of the 15th floor space located at 1201 Louisiana this afternoon.  On the walk through with me were Paul Foust (facilities), Robert Humlicek, Jeffrey Vincent and Andrew Hawthorn.  I previously talked with Deborah Bubenko and Vincent Fox about this space.  Comments from the review are as follows:

Most of the floor is composed of offices with some large group areas (conference rooms etc.) included.  The floor can accommodate up to 150 people.  However, with this amount of people in the area, space will be VERY tight. Almost all offices will need to hold at least two people.  Large offices will need to hold three or four.  The larger areas will need to have cubicles installed to make complete use of the space.  With maximum doubling up in the offices, you might fit a couple of conference rooms on the floor with one kitchen area.  There are nooks just off some of the hallways that would accommodate several network printers.

As Tommy stated in his earlier e-mail on the Allen center space, the fire code will require us to put a strobe in each office with multiple occupants. 

One area of concern is the amount of furniture currently on the floor.  The floor plan shows approximately 90 desks on the floor.  Some offices were locked so we could not verify the total.  However,  this number appears correct.  Also, for the most part, there were only desks in the offices unless they were occupied.  Chairs, filing cabinets, credenzas, etc. would needed to be added to this space.  We need to determine where the additional furniture will come from. 

There is one large area with 11 cubicles forming a circle.  According to Paul, this was the area where telephones were answered for the previous tenant.  This might work for the trading area.  The room appears to have the most telephone connectivity, is open, and would accommodate up to 11.

If we decide trader telephones are necessary (record conversations etc.), the cost associated with the purchase of the equipment and the necessary installation time will need to be factored into our schedule.  

The floor has two data closets.  At least one of the closets has 24 hour air conditioning according to Vincent.  

This floor has the same server connectivity at the Three Allen Center space.  A 100 meg single mode fiber connection serves this space. 

Robert has informed me that the floor currently has switches to support up to 200 ports.  However, this does not mean that the drops to all offices are complete.  Probably some cabling will need to be added.  It appears that the space can accommodate up to 150 users even with the extra ports needed for network printers, laptops, etc.  However, if we need to accommodate more than 200 ports, additional switches can be added. 

In summary, the floor space at 1201 Louisiana looks as good or better than the space that was being considered at Three Allen Center.

Sally,

Thanks for our meeting last week.  Please let me know if you don't think we've sufficiently defined the deliverable for Business Ops.  Based on feedback from Louise - you and I still may not be clearly communicating yet as to what is required.

Specifically, AEP and Enron need to agree in writing for each Business Ops "process" or function:

1.	Who is going to carry out the Business Ops processes before and after close.
2.	How control over the process will be handed over from Enron to AEP.
3.	The necessary IT actions required to put the required system functionality in place (and who is responsible for implementing this).	

The table you developed at the end of last week (based on Bob's email) moves closer to this point.   As we discussed on the phone, we need to provide a description of the deliverables for each of the "systems/activities" you listed on the table and ensure that AEP understands (and signs off on) what they are responsible for.  To Anne's point, this "sign off" can be through a memo, protocol, acknowledged email, or other.  

We have been having a problem in that one part of AEP does not talk to the other part.  So, I would like to encapsulate and elevate the individual Bob Hall/Steve Jackson discussions so that all relevant levels of AEP (and Enron) understand what is being agreed before we close.

Each Tuesday at 4:00 we have a standing HPL Transition Coordination meeting to discuss the status of the deliverables from each group.   You are welcome to attend this meeting or the separate meeting we have now established each Wednesday with Bob H. and Tommy Y. to concentrate on HPL/IT/Business Ops matters.

Sally,  thanks for you personal attention to this.    

The quicker we close the quicker Bob can focus more of his time on Network's origination efforts.

Regards,
Brian

Subject:	HPL Sale - Energy Operations Task List

I talked with Anne Koehler in Legal today to determine her understanding of what is required from Energy Operations prior to the effective sale of HPL.  Anne believes that she may have been the one to introduce the term "protocol" into these discussions.  To clarify, according to Anne, the "protocol" is not anticipated to be a formal legal document.  Instead, Anne envisions simply e:mails or memos between Enron and AEP with regard to any sharing of information, agreements on processes to be followed in the transition, etc.  Operational details to be decided between Enron and AEP have been handled exactly in that manner to date, with e:mails being sent from Bob Ball (Enron) to Steve Jackson (AEP).  

Only critical changes to the Purchase and Sale Agreement will be formally documented.  Bob Hall identified the treatment of cash accounts in the original Purchase and Sale Agreement as incorrect relative to cash flows for gas to be delivered in the month of May.  He has worked with Enron's treasury group to establish the correct procedures and has worked with Sandi Braband in Legal to document this change to the Purchase and Sale Agreement as an Amendment to that agreement.   As of today, Legal has completed revisions to that amendment and Anne Koehler is sending it to Mary Perkins in Enron's Treasury group for her review.  Upon Mary's review, Anne will forward the amendment to AEP for their review before final signatures.  

We devised this week a new format for incorporating the AEP-HPL transition issues on which my team has been focused and have provided that to both of you.  This new format incorporates the various memos and e:mails which have to date captured the status of transition issues.  Items that only require actions by Enron will be our "to do" list.  Each item has a due date and we will update you weekly on progress.  Those items that fall under the AEP list or which appear in both the Enron and AEP list will be the items to which we will evidence communication to AEP and/or their agreement via the e:mails or memos as suggested by Ann Koehler.  I believe that this should satisfy your requests earlier this week for written "protocol".   We will also update you weekly on the status of those e:mails and/or memos between ourselves and AEP.  

I understand that the two of you have a regular weekly meeting for an update on the HPL sale.  To provide clarity for these update meetings, may I suggest that we incorporate one of the following two approaches: 

	1)  Brian and I hold a regular meeting just prior to your update meeting so that Brian has a full 		understanding of operational transition items and their status, or 

	2) I attend the first part of your update meeting in order to provide a firsthand update to the two of you.  

Please let me know which one of these works best for you so that we can incorporate that into our schedules for next week.

AEP and the HPL transaction

There is a remote possibility that AEP may be slow in fitting out their offices  in time for the acquisition of HPL to reach closure sooner rather than later (essentially all of the wiring in between offices).  If so Brian is putting together a back up plan where they could be sited in our building.  This would mean that a link has to be made between their office and here - that's where you guys come in.  Brian will give you a ring to discuss using the direct connection EOL is putting in place as an intermediate step.

It might work?

Thanks

Louise

Steve,

Thanks for forwarding.  Actually, Brian sent it to me on Monday, and I followed up with Ann and Barbara.  I have not spoken with Brian yet because I am waiting for a green/red light from Barbara as far as Jade Eaton is concerned.  Barbara and I spoke at length yesterday and she is concerned about the counterparty's reaction to a meeting with DOJ (even an informal one).  She plans to get back to me though with regard to whether they want me to get involved at this stage.  I spoke to Rick as well so he is up-to-date with the current status.  

I'll let you know if anything further develops.  Thanks again.

Paul
In additon to the 188,371,296 property value for Bammel Lease that you mentioned below there was also a value on your spreadsheet for Bammel Gas Storage of 267,000,000.  Requirements to insure both of these amounts should be with AEP not Enron and thus the 2002 Plan Premium Allocations of $754,096 on the Bammel Gas Storage 267,000,000 value and $924,433 on the Bammel Lease value of 188,371,296 should not be needed.

We will advise the insurers effective this past June to delete these assets and will attempt to receive a refund. However, as respects asset divestitures, insurers have not been inclined in the past to refund premiums for comparatively small divestitures in view of our adverse loss experience. However, if we are successful in receiving a credit, we will refund the premium.

I will discuss with Karen and Brian the other remaining assets. 

Regards,

Yes,  

That will serve as a good flash as to how the schedule/issues roll up into a post-close financial position.  It has also been pinned to Jim's lapel to optimize the value of our basis calculation by allocating PP&E,  125 basis, and general plant between Houston and non-Houston assets.

Here are a few alternatives to handling Lal Echterhoff's situation:

(1)  We give cash difference in black-scholes value between one year and three year options calculated as of the termination date of 5/31/01.  The analysis isn't very pretty:  the total difference for all affected shares (165,000) is only $1652.  These options are so far in the money that the time value is de minimus.

 
(2)  We could have them cancel their old options and purchase on the open market some options with longer terms.  The lowest strike price available for January 04 leaps is $30 and the term still isn't quite long enough - most affected options have a strike price between $15 and $20.  This alternative would need tax, accounting, and SEC research and would cost about $4mm in total.

(3)  We could just purchase January 04 leaps with a strike price of $50 and not ask them to cancel their old options - this would cost aobut $2.2mm.  Still a problem with term not syncing with their old options, but it would give them the opportunity to "double-dip" in value if the stock ran up between now and May 31, 2002.

***************

If you would like me to do any further due diligence on any of the three above, let me know.

I still recommend the previously drafted email to Lal reiterating that the plan provisions prevail.  Morally, it may not be correct, but it would take an exorbitant amount of "feel-good" and money to get any further improvements in our ranking as the best place to work; Everyone knows what Enron is when they come here and we're very open about it.  We are efficiently Darwinistic, not feel-good-anything-you-want.  I don't think we should apologize to those who don't read their agreements or plan documents or the fine print (the caveats were there).

I do feel bad that this happened, and we should make sure the right people sign-off on this sort of thing in the future.

Regards,
Aaron

FYI - 

Sally - Bob and/or I will keep you posted on how we get on.  It may be a better outcome if we can sell our imbalances to AEP as we will have a hard time resolving them after the Close.

?	ENE should receive a pro rata share of the Land Office Payment for the portion of time (March through May) that ENE owned HPL and satisfied the storage obligations for the Land Office Gas.
?	ENE calculates the amounts owed to AEP as follows:

(i)  Calculation of Land Office Payment, less
(ii)	Cost to transport and inject Land Office Gas, less
(iii)	Calculation of value of storage services provided by ENE, equals
(iv)	Payment to AEP

?	ENE agrees that AEP is due a portion of the 2001 payment from Cannon based on the period of time that AEP and ENE owned HPL calculated as follows:

(iv) Total 2001 payments received from Cannon 525k
(v)	Portion of contract year that AEP owned HPL = 9/12

C.	Action Item:
?	Verify payment amounts and start of contract year. - DAVID BAUMBACH


3.	Cannon Storage: Contract #96059167

A.	HPL Position:
?	This agreement should be treated as a fixed price agreement rather than an index based agreement

o	Not a scheduled material contract as it was an ENA contract

?	This amount will be netted out of the working gas true-up payment. 

C.	Action Items:

According to facilities the 4th floor of Three Allen will be available starting April 1st.  I just finished a walk through of the space and have the following comments about possibly moving HPL on to the floor:

It is a mezzanine type floor which has overhangs which are open to the elevator lobby down below.  We'd need to stick trading and logistics into some of the large offices or joining conference rooms to keep them away from the lobby noise.

There are currently only 70 ports or network connections on the floor.  We'd need to pull additional cable to handle the approximately 150 people that would need to be on the floor.  If we decide so to use the floor we could get this done within a couple of weeks at most. 

The floor is set up with mostly offices and very few cubes.  We'd need to put together several people in each office to fit everyone into the space.  If we put more than one person in the office the fire code we require us to put a strobe in each office set up this way.

There is no telecom or wiring closet on the floor.  That means to make this work as is HPL would have to remain on our network and depend on us for telecom service via our Nortel switch during the stay in Three Allen since there would be nowhere for AEP to put servers or switches on the floor without any major build out.  There is no set up for the IPC Trader phones and currently no room to add an IPC rack on the 5th floor telecom closet.  We would have to either knock out a wall on the 5th floor closet or tell the traders to live without recorded phone conversations.

The good news is that Keith Dziadek and his team have figured out a way to make the EOL connection with AEP work that will have minimal impact to EOL.  We could use this link for HPL to access their Trade Blotter, Risk Systems and People Soft from AEP.

Bottom Line:  
The space on 4 is not ideal but it is available.  I will be receiving a floor plan today and will kindly forward a copy on to someone within your group to work with Bill Donovans group to see if there is anyway to get 150 people on the floor.  There will be some costs to set things up like additional cabling and installing some additional desks or workstations.  If we decide that trader phones are necessary then we would have to expand the 5th floor wiring closet.  If we decide to do this we may need to purchase an IPC switch, system and phones.  It cost me $60,000 when I purchased an IPC system for Bridgeline.  I will also check to see if we have a switch anywhere that we could borrow for a few months. 

We need to decide very quickly if this is what we want to do if we are shooting for having people over in Three Allen for the April Bid Week for May production.  We also need to talk about this additional cost with AEP and having them pick some or all of it up.  We also need to have AEP on board because they are building their side of the interfaces with our systems.  If the interfaces are not ready in time then the traders would need to enter trades into both Sitara and AEP's Risk System.  The bigger issue would be the interface with AEP's PeopleSoft system since they would be generating payments via this application.  The good news is that May production for physical trades will not settle until June giving them extra time to finish the interface.  Our side of the interfaces are pretty simple and I feel confident we will be ready to test in April.  

Let me know if you need any additional information.  -  Tommy

Louise,

I have developed the attached proposal that I would like to propose to AEP.  The basis of the proposal is that:

1.	 AEP would take on all costs, risks, liens, etc. associated with the Coastline law suite (low case $1.8MM, expected case $2.5MM).  

2.	Enron would forego 1 months of interest due to AEP's failure to get DoJ approval ($2.1MM).

Benefits to Enron:

1.	Potential savings in Enron expense vs. AEP's ability to capitalize the cost.

2.	Enron still retains the "DoJ stick" in that interest payments start on 1 June instead of 1 May.  

3.	Enron saves time and legal costs not having to defend against the claim.  

4.	Enron does not have to wrestle with AEP to get access to HPL staff who are involved in the suite.  (even though AEP is obligated to make resources available to help us with the claim, AEP will have no incentive to do so after the sale).    


Let me know if you have any objections or questions.

Brian

Louise,

Greg signed it and it went out Tuesday.  He was going to lob in a call to AEP as well, but I haven't heard whether that happened.  Would you like a copy of the signed letter as it went out?

Subject:	ENRON STOCK OPTIONS OF HPL EMPLOYEES


Gentlemen: 
Attached below are copies of some correspondence between Fran Mays and me regarding the time period allowed to exercise stock options after my involuntary termination from Enron due to the sale of Houston Pipe Line to AEP. 
  
Apparently various stock option plans allow different time periods for exercise in such cases--the norm seems to be three years.  However, employees who were able to participate in the original "all-employee" stock option plan at its inception were allowed a period of only one year.  It seems that employees who joined Enron in years following the inception of this plan were able to participate to a limited degree, but were allowed a three-year period in the case of involuntary termination.   
Following are the facts material to this issue: 
1. Fran Mays was represented to HPL employees as the authoritative source of information regarding Enron benefits available to employees who would be terminated due to the sale of HPL. 
2. Even though documentation of the various benefit plans exist, the documentation may not be clear in some cases and subject to interpretation by an authoritative Enron source.  It is always prudent for an employee to have an official company interpretation of any plan document rather than to rely on their own interpretation. 
3. In an instance of a divestiture, merger, or other change of control of a company, in my personal experience, there can be, and often are, modifications and exceptions to benefit plans. Usually this is done in the interest of fairness to  employees affected.  In my own case in the sale of HPL, there was an exception made since I did not retire from Enron, but for vesting of stock options was considered to have retired.  This allowed me to be vested in some stock options that I would have lost.  The monetary benefit of this exception was not significant since I only had about 25 unvested share options, but it is a precedent. 
4. I submitted to Fran Mays, through my supervisor, a question that specifically addressed the stock option exercise period. 
5. The only response to the specific written question that I submitted was contained in a general Q&A format response from Fran Mays which contains an unequivocal, direct statement that the period to exercise vested options after involuntary termination due to the sale of HPL is three years. 
6. There was a disclaimer in the Q&A document that referenced plan documents.  A disclaimer of this sort may be useful to address details of some specific issue or to allow clarification due to some ambiguity, but a disclaimer cannot negate and reverse a direct, clear, unequivocal statement of fact.  There is logic that allows the application of the disclaimer to a statement of fact. 
I, among a number of HPL employees who are former Enron employees, made significant personal decisions based on reliance on the statement in the Q&A that we had three years to exercise all options.  The one year period currently being allowed can impact both exercise price and income tax consequences.  Although I recognize that the actual impact depends on personal decisions of when to exercise options, in my case the combined impact could be very significant. 
>From AEP's perspective, Enron employees who agreed to stay with HPL and move to AEP with the sale added a great deal of value to the HPL acquisition.  It seems only reasonable to treat these former employees with a sense of fairness and not to penalize them for a career decision that benefited Enron. 
I am requesting that the time to exercise the original all-employee options be extended to three years.  This would make this stock option plan consistent with other Enron stock option plans and would settle the ongoing issue of the representation to HPL employees that the period would be three years.  This change would allow HPL employees who acted as loyal Enron employees and made a significant career choice that benefitted Enron to feel that they were treated fairly by Enron.

     Lal, thanks for your comments.  I have verified with the Corporate

     this situation.  The plan document provisions supercede the Q&A.

   Subject:  Re: STOCK OPTION QUESTIONS 
     Your position that the general disclaimer on the Q&A of March 8 
     negated the specific response to the question regarding the period to 
     exercise stock options is unacceptable.  If the answer to this 
     specific question, shown below,  was that various plans had various 
     periods for exercise, then that should have been the answer to the 
     question, not an unequivocal statement that the period to exercise is 
     three years.  I, and I am sure many others, made certain critical 
     decisions based on your statement which you now claim to be of no 
     validity.  I would suggest that the remedy to this situation is to 
     allow all stock options to have a period to exercise of three years 
     unless earlier due to the actual expiration date stated on the grant. 
     I use the term "expiration date" to be the normal expiration date that 
     would occur is options are unexercised and that would apply to anyone 
     continuing employment with Enron. 
     With regard to the position that the period to exercise is set by the 
     particular stock option plan and cannot be changed, anything can be 
     changed or special provisions made particularly in the course of a 
     transition due to a merger, spin off or sale of a company.  Special 
     provisions were made to exclude HPL employees from the new all 
     employee stock option plan, special provisions were made to provide a 
     5% payment to HPL employees in lieu of the new stock option plan, 
     special provisions were made to consider HPL employees over the age of 
     55 and with more that 5 years of service as retirees to allow vesting 
     of stock options and I feel sure that there have been other special 
     considerations to certain employees. 
     Lal Echterhoff 
     From March 8,2001, Q&A: 
     "1.  With the transfer to AEP, will my termination be listed as 
     involuntary so that I can exercise my vested options? 
      Yes,  your  transfer  to  AEP  will  be  treated  as  an  involuntary 
      termination by reason of divestiture from Enron. 
      2.  What is the time frame to exercise my vested stock options? 
      The  period  to exercise vested options upon involuntary termination, 
     retirement, death or disability is three (3) years." 
     . 
     From: Fran L Mayes/ENRON@enronXgate on 05/30/2001 02:14 PM 
     Subject:  STOCK OPTION QUESTIONS 
          We have received questions from many employees concerning the 
     expiration date for stock options.  The Q&A dated March 8, 2001 stated 
     three years as the  exercise date for options.  However,  on page 1 of 
     the document, a statement was included regarding the intent of the 
     document and that the stock 
          option plan document will govern all provisions of the stock 
     option program. 
          If you have options listed on the stock option termination report 
     which list a one year expiration, not three years as stated in 
     question # 16 of the document, this is   correct and follows the 
     provision of the plan document.  Some employees have options granted 
     under a DIFFERENT stock option plan and that plan carries 
          a three year term of expiration.  Please review your report 
     carefully to determine which plan your options were issued under. 
          Additionally, the document was intended to provide general 
     information only.  Page 1 included the statement regarding the plan 
     document specifically in case 
          there were any errors made in the document.  Additionally, we 
     stated that employees could obtain copies of the plan document for 
     their review.  Enron provides 
          the plan documents so that employees can familiarize themselves 
     with the plan and make decisions based on plan document. 
          I apologize for any confusion this may have caused, however, the 
     plan under which the options were granted is the official document by 
     which Enron determines 
          the termination date.  Please call me if you need to discuss your 
     options, however, understand that I cannot speak with you regarding 
     other employees'    compensation/options.

I finished the walk through of the 15th floor space located at 1201 Louisiana this afternoon.  On the walk through with me were Paul Foust (facilities), Robert Humlicek, Jeffrey Vincent and Andrew Hawthorn.  I previously talked with Deborah Bubenko and Vincent Fox about this space.  Comments from the review are as follows:

Most of the floor is composed of offices with some large group areas (conference rooms etc.) included.  The floor can accommodate up to 150 people.  However, with this amount of people in the area, space will be VERY tight. Almost all offices will need to hold at least two people.  Large offices will need to hold three or four.  The larger areas will need to have cubicles installed to make complete use of the space.  With maximum doubling up in the offices, you might fit a couple of conference rooms on the floor with one kitchen area.  There are nooks just off some of the hallways that would accommodate several network printers.

As Tommy stated in his earlier e-mail on the Allen center space, the fire code will require us to put a strobe in each office with multiple occupants. 

One area of concern is the amount of furniture currently on the floor.  The floor plan shows approximately 90 desks on the floor.  Some offices were locked so we could not verify the total.  However,  this number appears correct.  Also, for the most part, there were only desks in the offices unless they were occupied.  Chairs, filing cabinets, credenzas, etc. would needed to be added to this space.  We need to determine where the additional furniture will come from. 

There is one large area with 11 cubicles forming a circle.  According to Paul, this was the area where telephones were answered for the previous tenant.  This might work for the trading area.  The room appears to have the most telephone connectivity, is open, and would accommodate up to 11.

If we decide trader telephones are necessary (record conversations etc.), the cost associated with the purchase of the equipment and the necessary installation time will need to be factored into our schedule.  

The floor has two data closets.  At least one of the closets has 24 hour air conditioning according to Vincent.  

This floor has the same server connectivity at the Three Allen Center space.  A 100 meg single mode fiber connection serves this space. 

Robert has informed me that the floor currently has switches to support up to 200 ports.  However, this does not mean that the drops to all offices are complete.  Probably some cabling will need to be added.  It appears that the space can accommodate up to 150 users even with the extra ports needed for network printers, laptops, etc.  However, if we need to accommodate more than 200 ports, additional switches can be added. 

In summary, the floor space at 1201 Louisiana looks as good or better than the space that was being considered at Three Allen Center.

Anne and I talked  with Neil Imus (our V&E HSR lawyer) after our meeting this afternoon.  We relayed to him the substance of our discussions.  He reiterated his earlier position that there is "no harm" is requesting a shorter extension in a non-offensive fashion.   He had talked with one of AEP's lawyers earlier and AEP is considering requesting a meeting with Jade to discuss our need for a June 1 closing. We also believe that this would a good approach; however, the three of us concurred that timing is more important than the method of communication and that if a meeting cannot be arranged in the next day or two, we should go ahead and present our request over the phone, with a letter to follow perhaps.  We attempted to reconnect with AEP's lawyers but were unsuccessful.  We will continue to try to press AEP for a decision on how to proceed.  

Please call me or Anne if you have any questions.  We will keep you posted.

GREAT JOB TO ALL!!   We made it from contract execution to financial close in 5 months.  This success is a testament to the effort put forth by all of you and your colleagues in finalizing the transaction, including:

1.	Setting an industry record for responding to a 2nd request from the Dept. of Justice and securing their approval.
2.	Expediting the analysis and repair of a 60 mile segment of the A/S pipeline. 
3.	Transitioning HPL's hardware and software infrastructure from Enron to AEP
4.	Unwinding four complex monetizations related to the assets with a value of over $150MM
5.	Separating HPL's business process, work flow, from Enron (after 75 years of integrated operation)
6.	Segregating property between leased and purchased facilities
7.	Collecting and sorting over 14,000 boxes of books and records
8.	Moving over 250 people from 4 different Enron entities into a new location while keeping the pipeline operating.
7.	Accounting for the transfer of PRM assets, CWIP, leased assets, purchased assets, imbalances, payables and receivables.	

The transaction freed up approximately $725MM of capital that Enron can put to work earning higher rates of return in its newer businesses, but the work on HPL is not over yet.  There are a number of follow up activities that we need to complete in order to maximize the value of the HPL transaction.  Jim Coffey will be managing these activities on an ongoing basis, including:

1.	Collecting outstanding accounts receivable and working with AEP to resolve imbalances.
2.	Closing out accounting entries for property, work orders, external accounts payable, and internal charges.
3.	Eliminating and mitigating any impact from retained assets and liabilities.
4.	Fully transitioning HPL systems, facilities, and books/records to AEP.

Again, thank you for your effort - and if I have inadvertently missed anyone please pass along my appreciation to them as well.  We will be hosting a lunch for the Enron/HPL employees who worked on the transaction on the 15th of June at 12:00 in the Imperial Ballroom at the Hyatt Regency Hotel.  Please attend if your schedule permits.

Regards,
Brian

Anne:

Thanks for the prompt response.

I have some concerns about the Performance Guaranty.  The guaranty document=
 covers three specific contracts (referred to as "Transaction Agreements"),=
 but those contracts are not identified in the performance guaranty by cont=
ract number.  I have reviewed Schedule 4.13 and think I have identified the=
 three contracts as #96019120, #9604582 and #96002879, and I note that all =
of these contracts are also listed as "Newco Contracts on Schedule 4.13.  H=
owever, the parties to these three contracts as listed in Schedule 4.13 doe=
sn't match the designation of the parties in the performance guaranty.  Obv=
iously the three contracts have "changed hands" on both sides, i.e., seller=
 and buyer.   Since the performance agreement is an existing obligation of =
HPL, there must be a set of records that clearly traces and memorializes th=
e changes in the guaranteed obligations, and we must see that set of record=
s before AEP can finally determine how to address the performance agreement=
.  Obviously AEP doesn't want to create any unnecessary problems with Entex=
 as the beneficiary of the guaranty, but I want to be sure that this arrang=
ement doesn't need some attention in connection with the closing.  If you c=
an make the relevant records available I'll very promptly review them and w=
e can then decide if anything needs to be done before the closing.

Thanks for your help.

Robert and Louise:  Reading from the bottom up, here is a string of emails that determined we would let the provisions of the plan and agreement govern Echterhoff's issue.  By the way, some of his assumed facts aren't correct - we don't make exceptions regarding the plans because of bad accounting results.  Retirement for the stock plan is age 55 with 5 years of service regardless of whether you retire from Enron with respect to benefit programs.

If you would like to discuss, give me a call.

We are going to have to let the plan rule , however, I think this points out how important it is to always stipulate that the grant agreement rules.  Either verbally or in writing, we need to say " generally it is the shorter of the term of the option or 3 years.  This depends on when the grant was made."

The Q&A is not binding -- it clearly states that the plan prevails.  Unfortunately, some people have grants that do not have the 3-year period to exercise, although I understand that most of the more recent grants do have the 3-year period.

Pat, let me know if you disagree.

OK. So what do we say to these people "plan prevails, Q&A may have been misleading, but tough"?

If Mich tells me that Q&A is not legally binding on us I am fine with above. Since they are leaving us I have no desire to give them more than the plan entitles them to, but I am frustrated that we stated 3 years so clearly in Q&A.

We don't change the terms of option agreements at Enron because of uncapped earnings charges after changes are made.  Caveat seems fine and the provisions of the plan prevail.

Subject:	Re: STOCK OPTION QUESTIONS

Your position that the general disclaimer on the Q&A of March 8 negated the specific response to the question regarding the period to exercise stock options is unacceptable.  If the answer to this specific question, shown below,  was that various plans had various periods for exercise, then that should have been the answer to the question, not an unequivocal statement that the period to exercise is three years.  I, and I am sure many others, made certain critical decisions based on your statement which you now claim to be of no validity.  I would suggest that the remedy to this situation is to allow all stock options to have a period to exercise of three years unless earlier due to the actual expiration date stated on the grant.  I use the term "expiration date" to be the normal expiration date that would occur is options are unexercised and that would apply to anyone continuing employment with Enron.  

With regard to the position that the period to exercise is set by the particular stock option plan and cannot be changed, anything can be changed or special provisions made particularly in the course of a transition due to a merger, spin off or sale of a company.  Special provisions were made to exclude HPL employees from the new all employee stock option plan, special provisions were made to provide a 5% payment to HPL employees in lieu of the new stock option plan, special provisions were made to consider HPL employees over the age of 55 and with more that 5 years of service as retirees to allow vesting of stock options and I feel sure that there have been other special considerations to certain employees.

>From March 8,2001, Q&A:
"1.	With the transfer to AEP, will my termination be listed as involuntary so that I can exercise my vested options?
Yes, your transfer to AEP will be treated as an involuntary termination by reason of divestiture from Enron.
 2.	What is the time frame to exercise my vested stock options? 
 The period to exercise vested options upon involuntary termination, retirement, death or disability is three (3) years."

Subject:	STOCK OPTION QUESTIONS 


	We have received questions from many employees concerning the expiration date for stock options.  The Q&A dated March 8, 2001 stated three years as the 	exercise date for options.  However,  on page 1 of the document, a statement was included regarding the intent of the document and that the stock 
	option plan document will govern all provisions of the stock option program.  

	If you have options listed on the stock option termination report which list a one year expiration, not three years as stated in question # 16 of the document, this is 	correct and follows the provision of the plan document.  Some employees have options granted under a DIFFERENT stock option plan and that plan carries
	a three year term of expiration.  Please review your report carefully to determine which plan your options were issued under.

	Additionally, the document was intended to provide general information only.  Page 1 included the statement regarding the plan document specifically in case
 	there were any errors made in the document.  Additionally, we stated that employees could obtain copies of the plan document for their review.  Enron provides
	the plan documents so that employees can familiarize themselves with the plan and make decisions based on plan document.

	I apologize for any confusion this may have caused, however, the plan under which the options were granted is the official document by which Enron determines 
	the termination date.  Please call me if you need to discuss your options, however, understand that I cannot speak with you regarding other employees' 	compensation/options.

Louise:

Not sure if you want me to send you updates or not?  I sent you a copy of the latest HPL status report and I have been keeping John L. up to speed.  The critical path is the Texas AG's request that AEP execute a protocol describing how they will comply with existing regulations governing intrastate pipelines in Texas.   AEP is currently in discussion with the Texas AG and we will meet with AEP on Wed/Thursday.  Our gain/loss on sale picture for HPL is the same as when you left (e.g. we will meet plan).

I have also attached a summary of the key Tech Services deals.

Hope things are going well at home.

Brian
