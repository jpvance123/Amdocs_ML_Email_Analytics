Thanks for getting me the ISDA docs on Friday.

Subject: enovate risk policy

Attached is the latest risk policy from Peoples.  It appears that they have 
only made the one change that is highlighted.  However, I would request that 
we all re-read the policy in its entirety to ensure that there are no other 
changes which are not highlighted.  Vlady - here are some thoughts on your 
comments.  

1 - Stop limit size.  I don't think we will be succesful in trying to change 
this at this point.  Peoples Board has been presented with the $10 million.  
As we discussed, there can be no actions taken by the risk committee unless 
unanimous and we can always try to change it once we get going.  
2 - I changed Appendix I to reflect a Stop Loss Trigger limit determination 
period of each fiscal year.
3 - There are no differences in notifications for the 50% and 75% levels.  
The easiest thing to do may be to handle this internally if we want a 
different notification at the higher threshhold.  It does not need to be a 
formal part of enovate's policy unless we feel it absolutely necessary.
4 - The VaR language you provided has been incorporated as Appendix IV.

Overall, there have not been many changes.  I would like to get final 
comments, subject of course to Peoples changing their minds on something, as 
soon as possible.  My goal is to execute this policy the first part of next 
week.  Let me know if this is practical.

Thanks,

Gregg

Subject: Draft CA for curves

Kay - We have previously discussed the idea of a CA to specifically cover the 
curves.  We need to put this at the top of the list for this week.  Can you 
prepare a CA for the distribution of enovate curves to specific individuals 
at Peoples?  I would like it to read as follows:
Basis and Index curves will be provided daily for all points at which enovate 
has a position, whether hedged or open, to specific individuals employed in 
the risk management area.  (Individuals should be named on a schedule).
Curves are being provided for the express purpose of independent risk 
analysis of the enovate portfolio by Peoples Risk Management personnel.   

In return, the specific individuals will not forward, copy, or otherwise 
distribute the curves to any individual not on the approved schedule.  No 
communications, written or verbal, will be made to any person other than the 
enovate GM or the Enron designated enovate risk committee member regarding 
any aspect of the curves.  

I need some language regarding audit rights, but this should get you 
started.  Call me to discuss.

1.  I haven't seen the paperwork on the name change.  I asked around 
yesterday, and I have someone checking it out.  Initially going through Corp 
(vs. ENA) made it a bit more complicated to track down.

2.  I believe I sent you a form services agreement to review.  I think that 
the parameters for performing certain services can be captured by way of 
reference to a named guideline or procedure, or by attachment as an exhibit.  
I will resend the email for your easy reference.

Hope this helps.

Kay

Laura,

Here is a draft transfer price agreement:



I'm sure we may want to add some details, etc, but at least this gives us a 
beginning point.

I'm hoping that you received the revised draft of the Manlove LOI on 
September 8 which incorporated your initial comments to the first draft. We 
can discuss what you see as the most efficient path forward, and any 
additions, etc, you think are necessary.

I look forward to seeing you on Thursday, and breathing some cooler air for a 
change.

My cell phone is 713 304 8716, should you need to reach me in the meanwhile. 
I will also be checking my voicemail, but will not be picking up email.

Kay

Kay,

Please find attached for your review a Closing Documents list and a very 
preliminary draft of the Enovate Credit Agreement.  Once you have had a 
chance to review the attached with your business people, let's set up a call 
to discuss structure/changes/etc.  In addition to confirming the basics 
(lending entity, interest rate, term), we will need to discuss financial 
covenants

Please call me at 713.221.1419 regarding the foregoing.

Regards,

Heather

 Enovate's bank account is already set up under the Enron global agreement 
with Citibank. 

The facility will be lent by ENE and People's.  If People's does not fund its 
half of enovate obligatiosns and an overdraft of the enovate Citibank account 
occurs, ENE would eventually be liable for the overdraft amount to Citi 
(Sam-please confirm.)  If Enron would be liable under its gloabal account 
agreement then Enron needs an indemnification/guarantee from People's in the 
event that People's does not fund its half.

Gregg,

It is my understanding that Enron and Peoples intend to discuss the most 
appropriate form of ISDA documentation for enovate to use. Peoples has 
forwarded a form for our information, and we would like to reciprocate.

Therefore, attached per your request are sample ISDA documents as a starting 
point for discussions.  Since these are forms, there will certainly be 
aspects which will need revision based on discussions between Peoples and 
Enron.  These documents should be treated as confidential.

Kay,

I will be preparing the loan documents for the joint venture with Peoples.  I 
understand that the loans will be unsecured but cross guarantied (i.e., Enron 
will guaranty the People's loans and vice versa), but I have several 
additional, basic questions re:  the terms of the Enron loan and the 
intercreditor arrangements with Peoples.

In terms of beginning drafting the loan documents, answers to questions 6(a) 
and 8 would be extremely helpful in selecting an appropriate form.

1.  People's loan agreement -- will it be an exact clone of ours?

2.  Guaranties -- will the cross-guaranties guaranty payment to the other 
venturer of all unpaid amounts under such venturer's loan agreement, or will 
they instead function more as an intercreditor/sharing agreement (i.e., if 
one venturer receives a payment that the other does not, the paid venturer 
will share its payment ratably with the unpaid venturer)?

3.  Intercreditor Issues/Exercise of remedies -- Please confirm that there is 
to be no 100% lender vote requirement for acceleration, etc., and that each 
venturer can pursue remedies with respect to its loan independently (although 
I presume the facilities will be cross defaulted).

4.  Advancing mechanics -- besides requiring ratable advances with the 
People's facility, will there be any conditions precedent to advances other 
than the typical no default/representations true & correct/no MAC?

5.  Repayment -- will there be any commitment step-downs/mandatory 
prepayments?

6.  Interest -- what will the (a) interest rate basis and (b) margin be?

7.  Fees -- Will there be any sort of upfront fee?  What will the commitment 
fee be? (And what will the amount of Enron's commitment be?)

8.  Lender(s) -- Does Enron intend to keep its revolver as a single lender 
facility, or should we provide for a syndicated arrangement?

9.  Other information -- When will specific financial covenant information be 
available?

Please call me at 713.221.1419 regarding the foregoing.  I look forward to 
working with you on this transaction.

Thanks!

Heather

After hearing back from everyone, a meeting is scheduled for 3:00 today to 
discuss the cash management needs of enovate (formerly known as MEH).  Sam 
has reserved conference room 2718 for all of you in Houston.  Once you are 
all together, just call me.  Thanks for everyone's flexibility on short 
notice.

As you are all aware, Peoples' Board meets this Wednesday to approve the risk 
management policy.  Peoples met Friday with the Chair of their Audit 
Committee to review the policy.  Feedback has been positive.  The main 
concern is that proper reporting and controls are in place to monitor enovate 
and protect Peoples' interests.  They would like to forward the risk policy, 
as complete as possible, to Arthur Andersen for their review prior to the 
Board meeting.  Attached is the latest draft.  In order to expedite the 
review, I am forwarding it on without looking at Peoples' additional 
comments, in blue, in detail.  I would like to have any comments ASAP, but no 
later than first thing tomorrow morning.  If this doesn't work, please let me 
know.

Kay - they have changed some of David's language and I need your input from a 
legal/technical point of view as to the substance of their changes.

Vlady - any and all thoughts are greatly appreciated.

Richard and Laura - same goes for you, but I want to make sure you are 
comfortable with the rules of the game going forward.

Thanks,

Gregg

Attached is a markup of the previous DASH to reflect the latest proposed 
funding of enovate.  Daily, ENA and Peoples will each fund 50% of the cash 
requirements of enovate through their respective intercompany loans.  Rather 
than reduce the revolver to $25 million, I have left it alone at $50 million 
to accomodate expected growth and potential transactions.  In this regard, I 
have also attached a spreadsheet which shows the potential cash needs of 
enovate based on some very loose assumptions.  Let me know if you think the 
edits are sufficient. 

I think that Sarah Wesner is on vacation, so if we need input from Global 
Finance let me know and I will route it through other channels.  The initial 
capital contribution of $100,000 is scheduled for this Friday, October 6.  
Loan documentation and a services agreement is being drafted by legal.  The 
first payment out of enovate is scheduled for October 25, so that is our 
target date for completion.

Any questions or comments, please let me know.

Thanks,

Gregg

Attached is the weekly status update for the business setup of enovate.  I 
have highlighted in yellow those items which had activity this week.   The 
two most significant outstanding items continue to be completion of the Hub 
Agency Agreement and agreement and documentation of the transfer price 
arrangement. Please call me with any questions.

Hello - In order to cross one more item off of the enovate setup list, I 
would like to pursue the initial capital contribution required under the LLC 
agreement of $100,000 from each member.  Although we do not have loan 
facilities in place or final cash management protocol, I believe the initial 
funding can still take place.  If anyone has any other thoughts please let me 
know.  If not, I would like to schedule the initial funding for Friday, 
October 6th.  I believe that Mary Lynne will prepare the necessary vouchers 
and journal entries.  I am assuming that Enron MW, L.L.C., as Member, will be 
funding enovate, L.L.C.  Does ENA then fund Enron MW, L.L.C.? (Kay? Mary 
Lynne?)  

As an update - Peoples' Board meets next Wednesday, Oct. 4th to approve the 
risk management policy.  Assuming approval, enovate will be free to transact 
with third parties.  Therefore, depending on payment terms, money will begin 
flowing through the enovate account.  Therefore, any loan docs and service 
agreements should be in place by the second week of October.

Any thoughts, please let me know.

Thanks,

Gregg

Sara, I am forwarding this to you because as you will notice your last name 
has been misspelled.  I have been speaking with Peoples recently about the 
potential sale of some financial options via Enovate.  This has brought up to 
issue of the ISDA agreement.  I don't know if you are the one working on this 
specific ISDA, but I got your name off a document showing you as the person 
working in general on ISDA agreements between Enovate and third parties.

I will call shortly to insure you receive this, and one more to follow, and 
that you are the appropriate person.  If you need to reach me, my extension 
is 36900.

Thanks,

Steve

We were trying to finalize the ISDA between PEC and Enovate.
Fred is going to be out of the office until Thursday, but I wanted to

Based on the ISDA materials attached, do you know how close (best quess:
number of days, weeks or months) we are to finalizing the contract?

Thanks,

Karen - I will ask legal to forward you the draft of the loan document as 
soon as it becomes available.  I expect it by the end of this week.  If that 
changes I will let you know.  As for your question regarding the amount, the 
worksheet is simply an attempt to capture the potential maximum needs based 
on certain assumptions.  Depending on the positions we have in place, the 
various business lines could offset each other, but they could also be 
additive.  I tried to pick a middle ground for my request so that there is a 
realistic expectation of what the potential needs could be.  As for Global 
Finance, Sarah is back in the office so she will be handling the FASH.  
Lastly, I am currently assuming that the Peoples loan will mirror our loan 
with identical caps.  However, we have not presented a draft to Peoples yet 
for their review so they may have other ideas which they have not 
communicated yet.

Thanks,

Gregg

Subject: enovate revolver DASH  

Gregg,

Please e mail me a copy of the draft loan document at its current state, or a 
termsheet outlining the agreed-upon covenants/features.  I assume the loan 
document for both our piece and People' will be the exact copy for 
covenants/rights etc.  

The worksheet seems to imply a maximum cash needs, i.e. assuming all deals 
outstanding (which = 50% of the maximum capacity) will need funding at the 
same timeframe.  Do the underlying business lines have overlapping periods 
such that the outstanding amount at any given time is really less than the 
aggregate?  
We will need someone from Global Finance to fill out the FASH addendum before 
Ben Glisan signs off on the DASH.  Let me know who covers for Sarah at her 
absence.

Please take a quick look at the attached and give me a call.  Thanks.

Hub Agency Agreement.  I am not sure what the final form was, but I expect 
that it was very close to the one attached.  Please do not acknowledge

1-Is there anything left to do to change the name under the LLC agreement to 
enovate?
   2-I am attaching the overview cash protocol that was discussed during our 
meeting with Treasury, Accounting and Finance.  Who can begin crafting a 
services agreement around this template?  

That's it for this moment.

Thanks,

Gregg

Subject: Manlove Monetization

Since the time frame is short, I wanted to give you an outline to mark 
up/correct.

Here's how I understand the deal:

People's has the Manlove gas storage facility.  We have presented to People's 
a nonphysical method to monetize it, similar to what was done with Bammel.  
Since this is a regulated asset, regulatory approval will be required, and 
the consumers will receive part of the benefit of the monetization.  The 
essence of our deal is that Enron will receive 50% of the net earnings, up to 
$25mm, as our fee.  In consideration for this fee, Enron takes the financial, 
legal, accounting and engineering lead. Peoples and Enron will work together 
on the regulatory strategy formulation and implementation.

We want to present a draft MOU to Peoples this week.  The basic goals are:

Define scope of the agreement
Define our lead role in the 4 stated areas
Create exclusivity for Enron 
Define financial arrangements (cost/profit)
Get an acknowledgement that what was presented to them was proprietary, and 
covered by our confidentiality agreement.
Define term (5 years) 

Each party bears their own internal costs, and third party costs are split 
50/50, with prior approval.  In that regard an immediate concern is getting 
the engineering work kicked off.  

We want the agreement broad enough to cover physical withdrawals.  We do not 
want it specific to this field, since we want the benefit of the use of our 
methodology.

Please correct/supplement, etc.  

Thanks,

Kay

This is a very rough draft based on an agreement done previously with a jv 
company.  I'm sending it for Enron review only, since I haven't even read the 
entire thing yet.  I thought you might want to take a look at it to see what 
you think, and to consider the scope of the services to be provided.

As for legal services, one alternative would be to have the services provided 
by an outside law firm, not associated with either principal.

Could you forward me what you received from Clement regarding the corporate 
guaranty issue?  I would like to see what's the latest in that regard.

Thanks,

Kay

Hello - attached are copies of Schedule A (Enron MW) and Schedule B (Peoples 
MW) to the MEH LLC Agreement.  Peoples has included a few projects they are 
working on that don't have existing agreements.  Enron's list is much 
shorter, 3 agreements to be exact.  The third agreement is a storage deal 
with Nicor that would technically be a permitted activity under the trading 
exclusion.  However, I believe we decided to include it, but we need to also 
include the disclaimer language that inclusion on the Schedule does not imply 
a restricted activity.  I have asked Hunter Shively, Central Desk Director, 
if he knows of any other "middle-market" deals that we should include and he 
said no.  I have also had our back office run the counterparties through our 
trading systems to identify any term transactions that may currently be in 
place.  Other than the Nicor deal listed, there were only standard trading 
buy/sells with Nicor in the system.  Which brings up my last point, do we 
need to disclose the existence of Master Purchase Agreements with a Covered 
Gas Utility?  Trading uses these Agreements for standard physical buy/sells.  
Anything more complicated would be done under a separate agreement.  The 
Nicor deal was done under a separate agreement, not the existing Master.  If 
my vote counts, I say let's not include them.  But, I defer to the experts.  

Let me know your thoughts on the attached,

Thanks,

Gregg

Kay -- The attached notes look like they would be used for member loans to 
Enovate under the LLC Agmt (i.e., loans for capital expenditures and other 
purposes not covered by the credit facilities provided under the Credit 
Agreements).   (As you'll see when you review the attachments, those notes 
are non-interest bearing demand notes.)

Re:  the attached form of note -- it should work for purposes of member loans 
under the LLC Agmt, but you will need to decide how the LLC Agmt loans and 
the Credit Agreement's revolving loans "work" together ... i.e., can the LLC 
Agmt loans be paid from cash flow that would otherwise go to pay down the 
revolvers, and will they be subordinated to the revolvers?

I working with outside counsel to get a draft of the revolver prepared.  She 
(outside counsel, Heather Brown) has summarized the information I have given 
her as follows (see below), and I would appreciate your input as to whether 
it is accurate.  

Once we get a draft we can sit down and discuss it, and make sure we are on 
the right track. I believe Gregg said that this needs to be in place within 2 
weeks.

Thanks,

Kay
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks for the information.  If I deciphered this correctly, this is going to 
be what I would call an "autoborrow" facility ... Enovate's cash flow is 
swept into an account.  Each day:  (i) if Enovate's cash position is short 
(and availability remains under the loan agreements) advances are made under 
each loan agreement (probably directly into the acount), and (ii) if 
Enovate's position is long, the positive balance of the account is applied 
towards the outstanding loan balances, if any.  We'll need to get minimum 
target amounts (i.e., do you really want them paying down $1.00 of each 
loan?) from the business people.

Based on the foregoing, I suspect that these will be single-lender, prime 
rate based loan agreements (otherwise it would be a huge operational 
headache).  Once you confirm the single lender part, that will be enough 
preliminary information for me to start on a loan agreement.

Attached is a clean copy of the final enovate risk management policy.  My 
goal is to get this executed today.  Janet, it requires your signature as 
Board member.  Kay Mann and Jeff Hodge in legal have reviewed the policy and 
Jeff has provided a memo indicating his approval.  Kay will be initialing the 
signature pages.  Vladimir Gorny in ENA risk management, and the enovate 
Chief Risk Officer, has also reviewed the policy and has recommended 
approval.  He will be preparing a memo to the Board documenting his 
recommendation.  If you have any questions regarding the content of the 
Policy, give me a call and we can discuss it.

Thanks,

Gregg



Kay - You can fax the initialed signature pages to Christy Chapman at 
713-646-4940.  On your cover sheet please let her know to make copies first 
so that we can get duplicate originals.  Thanks.

One quick question - the LLC agreement provides for audit rights in relation 
to all of enovate's business.  Do you think that this CA also covers the 
provision of information for audit purposes?  If not, can we include that in 
this CA or should we have a separate CA for audit?

Kathleen - This e-mail should aid in the preparation of the Board 
Resolutions.  The attached file lists the appointment changes.  As for my 
signature authority, I am expecting that I would need to sign on behalf of 
enovate, L.L.C., Enron MW, L.L.C. and I suppose Enron North America by 
association.  The dollar amount can be set as low as practical.  I think in 
the L.L.C. agreement the Board reserves the right to approve contracts in 
excess of $50,000.  The real need is for pushing paper such as CA's, Master 
Purchase Agreements, etc.  Here is another question, if my authority is 
limited, who has the authority to sign in excess of my limit?  Laura Luce 
previously had such authority as General Manager (she is a VP at ENA).  If 
she now becomes the Board Member, can she also sign on behalf of enovate?  If 
so, is that because she is an officer of Enron MW or because she is a Board 
Member (i.e., can Peoples Board Member sign on behalf of enovate)?

Thanks - Gregg

1)

3) I think we want it to apply to whatever entity employs the individuals 
with access.  Most of these people will probably Peoples Energy Corp. 
employees, but I suppose we could make it also include all of their 
affiliates.  enovate can sign the CA as well, but since enovate doesn't have 
any employees I was assuming we could use Peoples Energy as the responsible 
legal entity.

4) After 3:00 is fine, let me know for sure soon enough that I can lock Sarah 
up.

Subject: enovate stuff

Kay - 

1) Attached is my quick attempt at writing something to make the management 
changes at enovate that we discussed.  Could you please review this and add 
the appropriate legal language.  I don't think that we need any Board 
approval for any of these changes, so is some type of notification sufficient?

2)  I would like to address the idea of signature authorities other than 
Laura at the same time.  My suggestion would be that Richard and myself be 
granted some level of authority to execute CA's, Master Agreements, etc. that 
have been reviewed and approved by legal.  If you can at least pull the 
template you used to get approval for the Director you mentioned and see if 
there would be any changes necessary that would be helpful.

3) I need to get the CA form for the curves and other information started.  
We can discuss this any time you want.

4) What is your availability tomorrow either 8-9:15 or after 3:00 to discuss 
the intercompany loan agreement, and will Heather be available?

I will be leaving around 2:00 for suburban trick or treating.

Thanks,

Gregg

Doug -

Pursuant to our discussions, attached is a copy of the revised letter for 
Peoples.  I have modified it to fit the current proposal and added some 
language believed to be necessary at this time.  You will also note that 
there is language indicating an assignment of this receivable to

Sara, I am forwarding this to you because as you will notice your last name 
has been misspelled.  I have been speaking with Peoples recently about the 
potential sale of some financial options via Enovate.  This has brought up to 
issue of the ISDA agreement.  I don't know if you are the one working on this 
specific ISDA, but I got your name off a document showing you as the person 
working in general on ISDA agreements between Enovate and third parties.

I will call shortly to insure you receive this, and one more to follow, and 
that you are the appropriate person.  If you need to reach me, my extension 
is 36900.

Thanks,

Steve

Sara,

We were trying to finalize the ISDA between PEC and Enovate.
Fred is going to be out of the office until Thursday, but I wanted to
forward the ISDA information he has been working on.
Based on the ISDA materials attached, do you know how close (best quess:
number of days, weeks or months) we are to finalizing the contract?

Thanks,
Brian

Hello Kay -

It's been a long time since we've last spoken and I hope things are well.
In November, Gregg Penman had sent me two confidentiality agreements related
to enovate and asked that I forward any comments to you directly.  I finally
have reviewed them and have a couple comments.

The only proposed changes that need explanation are in paragraphs 1 and 3 of
each agreement.  Paragraphs 1 and 3 are typical provisions in a
confidentiality agreement where each side is evaluating a transaction.
However, the confidential information disclosed under these particular
agreements is going to be used not only for trading activities but also in
connection with audit rights related to an existing and ongoing contractual
relationship.  The confidentiality agreements should not affect enovate's
and PMW's rights under the LLC Agreement.  Accordingly, the proposed changes
are my attempt to clarify the usual text.

Please call if you wish to discuss.  I believe my procrastination has
resulted in the business people wanting to sign these up next week, so your
attention to this is appreciated.  Thanks.

_______________________________________________________________

The "Governmental Aprroval" sections work as we discussed: Under Article
10.2, initial effectiveness is contingent on receipt of an ICC Order
acceptable to each party (note-this is an ICC order "required" for the
agreement to take effect). The Agreement can terminate under 15.1(e) if a
"Judgment" (court order, regulatory order etc.) determines that, as a
result of Hub Transactions, Peoples is subject to comprehensive regulation
as a natural gas co. or loses its Hinshaw status. Under 15.2, the Agreement
terminates if it is found void or illegal, or at the option of either party
if found void or illegal in part with frustration  of purpose. The intent
of our wording in these sections, and the related definitions, is to
eliminate the termination right (which was included in Peoples'intial
draft) for a regulatory action, such as an ICC order which adopts an
unfavorable ratemaking treatment for Hub revenues, but does not find the
agreement to be illegal or void. The thought was that, after Peoples
obtains an accpetable intial blessing from the ICC, the risk of some later
regulatory action short of a finding of illegality should rest with Peoples
during the Agreement's term.

1)

3) I think we want it to apply to whatever entity employs the individuals 
with access.  Most of these people will probably Peoples Energy Corp. 
employees, but I suppose we could make it also include all of their 
affiliates.  enovate can sign the CA as well, but since enovate doesn't have 
any employees I was assuming we could use Peoples Energy as the responsible 
legal entity.

4) After 3:00 is fine, let me know for sure soon enough that I can lock Sarah 
up.

Thanks,

Gregg

Subject: enovate stuff

Kay - 

1) Attached is my quick attempt at writing something to make the management 
changes at enovate that we discussed.  Could you please review this and add 
the appropriate legal language.  I don't think that we need any Board 
approval for any of these changes, so is some type of notification sufficient?

2)  I would like to address the idea of signature authorities other than 
Laura at the same time.  My suggestion would be that Richard and myself be 
granted some level of authority to execute CA's, Master Agreements, etc. that 
have been reviewed and approved by legal.  If you can at least pull the 
template you used to get approval for the Director you mentioned and see if 
there would be any changes necessary that would be helpful.

3) I need to get the CA form for the curves and other information started.  
We can discuss this any time you want.

4) What is your availability tomorrow either 8-9:15 or after 3:00 to discuss 
the intercompany loan agreement, and will Heather be available?

I will be leaving around 2:00 for suburban trick or treating.

Thanks,

Gregg

It looks like your memory serves you well.  Section 6.8.2 allows the Managing 
Member to designate officers of enovate.  I revised the original appointment 
declaration you prepared to reflect Laura as VP.  Take a look at it and let 
me know if it works.  If so, I will probably ask you to have Janet execute it 
at your convenience.

I have not received anything from Clement regarding the corporate guaranty

This is a very rough draft based on an agreement done previously with a jv 
company.  I'm sending it for Enron review only, since I haven't even read the 
entire thing yet.  I thought you might want to take a look at it to see what 
you think, and to consider the scope of the services to be provided.

As for legal services, one alternative would be to have the services provided 
by an outside law firm, not associated with either principal.

Could you forward me what you received from Clement regarding the corporate 
guaranty issue?  I would like to see what's the latest in that regard.

Thanks,

Hello everyone.  More fun issues from Chicago.  I would like to discuss the 
different options available for giving parent guarantees to third parties.  
As everyone knows, to date we have had two third party transactions requiring 
parent guarantees.  In the Trunkline transaction, each parent issued separate 
guarantees for 1/2 of the requested amount, negotiated by respective 
counsel.  In the Alliance transaction, Enron issued a guarantee for the 
entire amount and Peoples has presented us with a reimbursement agreement 
which we are reviewing.  Peoples' Board meets next Wednesday, Oct. 4, to 
approve the risk management policy.  Assuming the policy is approved, deal 
flow should begin to increase and I would like to discuss how these 
guarantees can best be handled going forward.  My thought was an hour or so 
next Monday, Oct. 2, to the extent everyone is available, with a follow up 
meeting with Peoples perhaps Wednesday.  Let me know how your calendar looks 
and I will coordinate the meeting.

Jeff & Kay:  Although this has been initially focused on parent guarantees, 
this is part of a larger issue regarding negotiations of enovate contracts in 
general.  For instance, we have agreed to templates for a Master Purchase and 
Sale Agreement and a GISB Agreement.  However, who is authorized to make 
changes and negotiate on behalf of enovate?  We can discuss any suggestions 
for handling these situations as well.

Thanks,

Gregg

Kathleen,

We have forms for confidentiality agreements.  All CA's are processed through 
Kay Young, as she maintains the data base.  Kay, could you point Kathleen to 
the repository of the forms so that she can generate the first draft? By the

Subject: Draft CA for curves

Kay - We have previously discussed the idea of a CA to specifically cover the 
curves.  We need to put this at the top of the list for this week.  Can you 
prepare a CA for the distribution of enovate curves to specific individuals 
at Peoples?  I would like it to read as follows:
Basis and Index curves will be provided daily for all points at which enovate 
has a position, whether hedged or open, to specific individuals employed in 
the risk management area.  (Individuals should be named on a schedule).
Curves are being provided for the express purpose of independent risk 
analysis of the enovate portfolio by Peoples Risk Management personnel.   

In return, the specific individuals will not forward, copy, or otherwise 
distribute the curves to any individual not on the approved schedule.  No 
communications, written or verbal, will be made to any person other than the 
enovate GM or the Enron designated enovate risk committee member regarding 
any aspect of the curves.  

I need some language regarding audit rights, but this should get you 
started.  Call me to discuss.

Gregg

Attached is a draft of the CA for Peoples based on Gregg Penman's information 
below.  Gregg says he also wants some language to be included regarding audit 
rights.  I did not include this language because I'm not sure how to word it 
(and I could not find an example).

By the way, I used another People's CA I got from Ed's directory as an 
example because it seemed to fit better than the one I got from you on Friday.

Gregg wanted some pretty specific reference to the confidential data being 
supplied to Peoples, and most of the examples I reviewed were more general.  
Please let me know what I need to change.

Kathleen



This is the example I used:

We have forms for confidentiality agreements.  All CA's are processed through 
Kay Young, as she maintains the data base.  Kay, could you point Kathleen to 
the repository of the forms so that she can generate the first draft? By the

Heather,

This is a rough cut of a services agreement.  Since the loan agreement, 
services agreement and LLC agreement are all pieces of the same puzzle, I 
thought I would send it your way.

This is a very rough draft based on an agreement done previously with a jv 
company.  I'm sending it for Enron review only, since I haven't even read the 
entire thing yet.  I thought you might want to take a look at it to see what 
you think, and to consider the scope of the services to be provided.

As for legal services, one alternative would be to have the services provided 
by an outside law firm, not associated with either principal.

Could you forward me what you received from Clement regarding the corporate 
guaranty issue?  I would like to see what's the latest in that regard.

Thanks,

Kay

Kay-

I will look at your copy of the LLC regarding delegation of powers (or if I 
can't find it, I will get a copy from the Corporate Secretary's office).

The draft CA does not mention Peoples having to get their consultants to sign 
the CA, but I can put something in.

Where are you?  I talked to Carlos today and I believe he will be with us 
soon (if we can hire him).  He is anxiously awaiting your return from NY.

Hi Kathleen,

I want to get Laura Luce to direct us to give Gregg signing authority.  As 
you know, the request for Ben came from Janet, not Ben. I'll check with her.  
do you have the LLC agreement to see how changes are handled?  If not, you 
can get a copy of my copy.  It is not a standard agreement.

On the CA, please make the effective period two years from the latest 
disclosure of info, and the disclosures will be ongoing. I don't have the CA 
in front of me, but does it say that Peoples has to get their consultants to 
sign a CA as well?  It is a good question.

Ta ta for now,

Kay

Kay,

Gregg posed an interesting question yesterday regarding the Confidentiality 
Agreement.  If Peoples supplies our confidential information to Arthur 
Andersen, and someone from AA tells the world our secrets, would Peoples be 
on the hook pursuant to our CA?  I guess one way we could take care of this 
would be to include Arthur Andersen on Schedule I of the CA as one of 
Peoples' Representatives.  Any thoughts?

Also, I will work on getting Gregg signing authority re his message below.

Subject: Re: enovate stuff

Kathleen - This e-mail should aid in the preparation of the Board 
Resolutions.  The attached file lists the appointment changes.  As for my 
signature authority, I am expecting that I would need to sign on behalf of 
enovate, L.L.C., Enron MW, L.L.C. and I suppose Enron North America by 
association.  The dollar amount can be set as low as practical.  I think in 
the L.L.C. agreement the Board reserves the right to approve contracts in 
excess of $50,000.  The real need is for pushing paper such as CA's, Master 
Purchase Agreements, etc.  Here is another question, if my authority is 
limited, who has the authority to sign in excess of my limit?  Laura Luce 
previously had such authority as General Manager (she is a VP at ENA).  If 
she now becomes the Board Member, can she also sign on behalf of enovate?  If 
so, is that because she is an officer of Enron MW or because she is a Board 
Member (i.e., can Peoples Board Member sign on behalf of enovate)?

Thanks - Gregg

1)

3) I think we want it to apply to whatever entity employs the individuals 
with access.  Most of these people will probably Peoples Energy Corp. 
employees, but I suppose we could make it also include all of their 
affiliates.  enovate can sign the CA as well, but since enovate doesn't have 
any employees I was assuming we could use Peoples Energy as the responsible 
legal entity.

4) After 3:00 is fine, let me know for sure soon enough that I can lock Sarah 
up.

Kay - 

1) Attached is my quick attempt at writing something to make the management 
changes at enovate that we discussed.  Could you please review this and add 
the appropriate legal language.  I don't think that we need any Board 
approval for any of these changes, so is some type of notification sufficient?

2)  I would like to address the idea of signature authorities other than 
Laura at the same time.  My suggestion would be that Richard and myself be 
granted some level of authority to execute CA's, Master Agreements, etc. that 
have been reviewed and approved by legal.  If you can at least pull the 
template you used to get approval for the Director you mentioned and see if 
there would be any changes necessary that would be helpful.

3) I need to get the CA form for the curves and other information started.  
We can discuss this any time you want.

4) What is your availability tomorrow either 8-9:15 or after 3:00 to discuss 
the intercompany loan agreement, and will Heather be available?

I will be leaving around 2:00 for suburban trick or treating.

Thanks,

Gregg

A draft of testimony which would be filed at the ICC with the Master Sales
Agreement Petition is attached to the accompanying memo from Jerry Fox. As
you may recall, we suggested that the draft Petition prepared by Peoples
several weeks ago be revised to better explain the transactions which would
occur under the Master Agreement and provide a basis for the ICC to
conclude that approval of the agreement is in the public interest. At the
time, Jerry said he generally agreed with the comments, but had to get more
information from his client to finalize the Petition. His intent was to
obtain the information in the form of draft testimony, which he has now
done. My preliminary review indicates that the testimony, which would
accompanying the Petition, is adequate. It explains the nature of the
expected transactions, explains how Peoples' customers benefit from the
transactions (i.e., why approval is in the public interest) and supports
the compensation mechanism. Although the testimony is somewhat sketchy, it
should be sufficient to initiate the review. The ICC Staff can ask for
whatever additional information it wishes to consider. When I speak to
Jerry, I plan to ask whether the initial draft Petition would be modified
to discuss some of the information he now has. (I believe this could be
easily done.) In any event, the basic information needed to support the
filing seems to be there. Let me know of any comments. I will wait until I
hear back before talking to Jerry Fox. (Am I correct that the new name,
Enovate (which I hadn't seen before), should be capitalized, despite the
testimony's use of small case?)

Hi Kay -

You may recall that back in February, we almost finalized two
confidentiality agreements related to enovate L.L.C. activities.  Our
auditors will be sending to enovate shortly a letter indicating they would
like to review various books and records of enovate and ENA as its
activities relate to enovate.  In connection with the review, we need to
finalize those confidentiality agreements.

I have made the change you requested in the attached e-mail to both of the
agreements (PEC and enovate) and have attached below an execution copy of
the agreements for ENA to date and send to PEC and enovate for siganture.
Assuming the attached copies are acceptable, please have ENA sign two
originals of each agreement and send them to me.  I'll arrange for Bill
Morrow to sign the PEC agreement and work with Greg Penmen to have enovate
sign the other agreement.

If you have any questions, please call.  Thanks for your assistance.

Greg called.  He mentioned that the agency agreement is ready to go to 
Peoples after we've incorporated any comments you may have on the draft I 
circulated yesterday.

I look forward to hearing from you at your convenience.

Thanks!

Molly - In your opinion, (1) when do you think the earliest date is that we 
could complete the Credit Policy and (2) what specifically needs to be 
accomplished to hit that date?  I am assuming the following still neds to be 
completed:
 1.  Form of Schedule to ISDA and paragraph 13 - I spoke with Kay Mann 
yesterday and have asked her to speak with Sara Shackleton to find out what 
the delay is.  Have you heard anything new?
 2.  Rewrite of certain language 
  a.  References to the Credit Aggregation System
  b.  More clarity on division of responsibilities (above vs. below 
investment grade)
  c.  Protocol for exceptions, if any
 3.  Review initial approved counterparty list and add any other potential 
counterparties

I am sure this list is not complete, so let me know what else needs to be 
done.  I would like to establish a target completion date, but not without 
your input first.  We intend to turn the Hub Agency Agreement to Peoples 
today.  As such, I would like to have the credit policy complete by the time 
I sit down with Peoples next week.  Let me know what is reasonable and if 
there is anything I can do to assist in expediting the process.

Thanks,

Gregg

I responding to your comments as follows:

Sect. 1.9.  The second to last sentence in the definition of Cumulative Net 
Revenues duplicates part (but not all) of the first sentence of Section 7.2 
with regard to what is included in Cumulative Net Revenue. . . . Perhaps the 
make-up of Cumulative Net Revenue should be covered in just one place or, as 
an alternative, the definition 1.9 could cross-reference 7.2.

You're absolutely right.  The "and, for purposes of Section 7.1, Section 7.2" 
reference is a bust.  I've recast the sentence as "The calculation of 
Cumulative Net Revenues is made expressly subject to Sections 2.10 and 7.2."

I don't believe the language of Sect. 7.2 regarding the make-up of Cumulative 
Net Revenue is intended to be only "for purposes of Section 7.1" as the 
wording of 7.2 suggests.

I included that to avoid any unintended consequences in the event we later 
use "Cumulative Net Revenue" in other contexts for which it wouldn't be 
appropriate to include such refund-revenues; but if you believe it's 
confusing, I'll delete the clause.

Sect. 3.3. I would delete part (i) if the last sentence. It would be illegal 
and contrary to this Agreement for MEH (or Peoples) to charge a rate above 
the maximum, so it seems inappropriate to suggest that MEH can collect a fee 
for doing this.

Per our discussion, I agree that it seems inappropriate to contemplate 
knowing violations of federal law.  I'll soften it so it will have a better 
chance of not raising regulatory hackles.

Perhaps we should just make Peoples responsible for all refunds. Let me know 
what you think.

That would be easier, but it seems fair that we should be responsible for 
risks we knowingly or recklessly assume.

Also, 6 lines from the end of 7.2, I think the reference to 7.2 (ii) is a 
typo. I believe it's just 7.2.

It's now changed.

Sect. 18.3. Do we want to include any work related to the Governmental 
Approval as "ordinary course"?

My inclination is to not include it, so as to avoid arguments with Peoples 
over what's extraordinary and what's ordinary in this context.

As always, I thank you for your help.  DT

Subject: Enron/Peoples -- loan documents

Kay,

I will be preparing the loan documents for the joint venture with Peoples.  I 
understand that the loans will be unsecured but cross guarantied (i.e., Enron 
will guaranty the People's loans and vice versa), but I have several 
additional, basic questions re:  the terms of the Enron loan and the 
intercreditor arrangements with Peoples. 

In terms of beginning drafting the loan documents, answers to questions 6(a) 
and 8 would be extremely helpful in selecting an appropriate form.

1.  People's loan agreement -- will it be an exact clone of ours?

2.  Guaranties -- will the cross-guaranties guaranty payment to the other 
venturer of all unpaid amounts under such venturer's loan agreement, or will 
they instead function more as an intercreditor/sharing agreement (i.e., if 
one venturer receives a payment that the other does not, the paid venturer 
will share its payment ratably with the unpaid venturer)?

3.  Intercreditor Issues/Exercise of remedies -- Please confirm that there is 
to be no 100% lender vote requirement for acceleration, etc., and that each 
venturer can pursue remedies with respect to its loan independently (although 
I presume the facilities will be cross defaulted). 

4.  Advancing mechanics -- besides requiring ratable advances with the 
People's facility, will there be any conditions precedent to advances other 
than the typical no default/representations true & correct/no MAC?

5.  Repayment -- will there be any commitment step-downs/mandatory 
prepayments?

6.  Interest -- what will the (a) interest rate basis and (b) margin be?

7.  Fees -- Will there be any sort of upfront fee?  What will the commitment 
fee be? (And what will the amount of Enron's commitment be?)

8.  Lender(s) -- Does Enron intend to keep its revolver as a single lender 
facility, or should we provide for a syndicated arrangement?

9.  Other information -- When will specific financial covenant information be 
available? 

Please call me at 713.221.1419 regarding the foregoing.  I look forward to 
working with you on this transaction.  

Thanks!

Heather

Subject: Master Sales

Jerry Fox called to tell me that a decision has been made to by Peoples to
withdraw the Petitions for Approval of the PGL and North Shore Master Sales
Agreements. Jerry says this has been discussed with Enron. According to
Jerry, the intent is to proceed with some of the transactions contemplated
by the Agreement under exceptions to the affilliated interest approval
requirements. (As you may recall, we discussed the possibility that some
PGL/North Shore-enovate transactions may be expempt from the approval
requirement before the Peitition was filed. ) At this early stage of the
approval filing, the ICC Staff has not submitted testimony explaining its
opposition to approval. From the Staff's data requests, however, it appears
that they are not convinced that there is sufficient customer (i.e.,
public) benefit from establishing a contract between a utility and an
affiliated entity to perform the transactions contemplated by the Master
Sales Agreement when Peoples/North Shore acknowledge in the Petition that
there are other contracts in place with non-affiliates to perfrom the same
type of transactions. The Petition takes the position that the contract
with enovate is beneficial in the same respect that each non-affiliate
contract has benefit. ICC Staff (apparently) feels that the incremental
benefit of one more contract is not enough to offset perceived risks
associated with blanket approval of affilliate transactions under the
Agreement. It may be possible persuade staff to change its position if we
can show that the agreement with enovate will have a more significant effec
on PGL/Noth Shore that one of the non-affiliate agreements. In other words,
evidence of something unique or special about what enovate brings to the
table is what could turn this around (if you are interested in doing so.) .
Please call with any questions you may have.

I attach for your review a draft of the Agency Agreement, redlined against 
the draft Simon Halfin sent us June 9th as well as a clean draft.

I understand from Greg that a few matters are still under discussion, such as 
the payment arrangements, and will need to be worked into the next draft.

ok, I will ask Jerry to copy me on the data responses, and plan to attend
the hearing, In general, I will ask that Jerry keep me posted on
developments with copies of filings etc.  I will copy you and Gregg on
materials I receive (since I assume you aren't otherwise receiving them).
Let me know if this is the type of monitoring which you would want.

The revised draft is attached, revised per Kay's and your comments.  I have 
not re-run a redline, since the differences between the versions were minor 
and essentially spelled out in Kay's and your email.

To whom should I send it (noting of course per your comment in the cover 
letter that we may be adding language regarding an MEH-owned account for 
receiving Hub Shipper payments)?

Thanks!  DT

Hi Jeff,

I guess this answers the question of whether the policy has been adopted.

I'm at home this am, as I'm on my way to MD Anderson to donate blood for a 
friend's son who has leukemia.  I don't think it will take too long, but they 
don't open until 930.

Kay - Can you please review this additional language to the risk management 
policy ( or circulate to Jeff Hodge)?  In light of the CA regarding curves, I 
am slightly concerned with a blanket statement essentially giving Peoples 
unlimited access to information. I know that we address audit rights in the 
LLC agreement so this may not matter anyway if this is a right they already 
have.  Let me know what you think.

Thanks,
