Please find enclosed a draft CA for the McNeil bullet work for your
review.  I would like to highlight a couple of points;

- we had talked about a press release being issued by mid-December
during our initial meeting in Houston on Nov. 9.   The CA as currently
worded would require all parties concurrence on any press release.  In
meeting the spirit of the CA, TransCanada would like to state that it
would like to meet that deadline for issuing a press release and would
ask each of you to indicate whether you would support that or not.  We
will have some points available within a week outlining what we feel the
release would say but it would be similar to what we discussed
previously.

- on the issue of entities to be covered by the CA, we would ask that El
Paso consider a corporate entity rather than ANR.  Our reason is that
resources are likely to be seconded from groups other than ANR within El
Paso and we would like the CA to cover all relevant entities and
personnel directly than indirectly through ANR.

As a final note, the first draft of the Joint development agreement
should be ready late Wednesday.  Recognizing that Thursday is a holiday,
the draft should be on your email by Friday morning for your review. -
thanks - Paul

I wanted each of you to be aware that TransCanada has agreed to a request from Governor Knowles office for a meeting on November 30th in Anchorage on behalf of the A to B project sponsors.   I expect we may all receive a communication from TransCanada (Dennis McConaghy) with details regarding this meeting.

I'm about done with a redlined version of the 4:16 draft MOU that incorpora=

in writing to everyone before we agree to the MOU.  My redline would be one=
 way to do that, another would be a simple letter explaining our position--=
i.e., that we will  sign the current MOU but that our understanding of it i=
s that it gives us the flexibility to negotiate for (1) and (2) without bei=

Tony + Kim,

Several of the rejoining partners of ANNGTC have contacted me asking if Enron is interested in selling its residual claims.  The answer is most definitely affirmative.  Please advise on the following-

What are the bankruptcy court's requirements to undertake a mandated auction?
Is it possible through the bankruptcy court to extinguish liability claims arising prior to NAGC's withdrawal from the ANNGTC partnership?  If so, how?

Here's how I would like to proceed-
Prepare an offering letter that identifies what we are selling and preferred terms + conditions
Distribute to each partner, possibly other interested parties (ANS producers)
Obtain bids and evaluate best offer

I would like to begin the sales process asap and would appreciate your feedback most urgently.

Yesterday, Enron provided comments on the MOU which raise several new issues of substance. TransCanada & Westcoast recommend that these matters be deferred and included with our discussions on the commercial proposal and the Partnership Agreement, as we have agreed on a number of other issues. 
As we discussed on Tuesday's conference call, we believe the first priority for ANNGTC is to finalize the MOU now, & put it "on ice", to permit all parties to obtain the required governance approvals by Nov. 15 - also the press release would be drafted, circulated & approved and ready to go at that time. 
Secondly, the commercial proposal to ANS Producers must be initiated in early November to meet a mid-Dec. deadline. This proposal will of necessity have the group addressing the large commercial alternatives in order to establish a viable and attractive project. 
We recommend a conference call on Monday @ 1:30 PM (Mountain time) to finalize the MOU - we will arrange a dial-in #.. Please provide your comments on the MOU to Murray & I today.

Please see the attached red-line with our comments. 
In paragraph 8, I've proposed new language to address that pre-existing 
residual claims must be satisfactorily addressed before a new 
partnership agreement would be executed.  Also, I've outlined the 
possibility for other forms of ownership than just a partnership. 
In paragraph 9, I've outlined a non-exhaustive list of issues to be 
addressed in the joint development and coordination agreement. 
During the next round of discussions following the MOU, I would like to 
explore the merits of rejoining partners having the right to rejoin as 
either a developing or non-developing party.  The outline structure I 
propose would be as follows- 
- In either case, ownership levels are as set out in the MOU 
- A developing party would have full voting rights and full financial 
responsibility during the development phase 
- A non-developing party would make MOU payments but otherwise not have 
voting rights or financial responsibility 
- A non-developing party could become a developing party at a specific 
time in the future and upon specific terms 
- Non-developing parties would agree to release their claims for AFUDC 
and interest to the extent commercially necessary

Subject:	ANNGTC Confidentiality Agreement

I have reviewed the ANNGTC confidentiality agreement (the two page letter agreement included in the package) and have several comments.  I've attempted to briefly explain the basis for each change in brackets after the change.  I'm circulating these by this email so you all can jump in if you have further comments.  Please give me a call if you have any questions or comments.  DF

--in the second paragraph, line 2, after "concerning" add: ", without limitation,"  [I don't know exactly what the disputed issues under the old partnership agreement are at this time, and don't want this signed letter agreement used as a basis for someone's claim that we've waived an argument.]

--second paragraph, lines 4-9:  delete the sentence beginning with "Furthermore" and ending with "Partnership."  [This sentence serves no purpose but to assert an interpretation of section 4.4.4 of the Partnership Agreement.  Since that section apparently (Foothills and Westcoast believe) limits the rights of the withdrawn partners, I'd prefer to let section 4.4.4  speak for itself and not have us sign any documents that arguably endorse any parties' interpretation of that language.]

--page 2, line 1:  after "(b) your" add:  "execution of this agreement and".  [I'd like to broaden our protection so our signing of this letter agreement cannot be argued to constitute a waiver of any argument or otherwise compromise our position.]

--page 2, Section 2.(c), line1:  after the words "not be used" add:  "by the Receiving Party".  [Any party that currently has information should be able to use that information for any purpose it wants in the future--including as evidence in a fight about the Partnership Agreement.  That should be true whether the party having such information chooses to disclose it to someone else under this letter agreement or not.   The restriction on use should be limited to that information that a party obtains solely due to another parties' disclosure pursuant to this letter agreement.  I suspect that's what they intended, but it needs clarification.]

A revised model of the project is in the shared driver. Please check "Iteration" (under Tools-Options-Calculation in Excel) and put Max Interation at 200 before you open the file. 

For "Cost of Service" page, we now have $0.70 for traditional rate and $0.59 for levelized rate. We are still $0.16 away from Foothills $0.43 but we believe we know what accounts for $0.11 difference; if we use Foothills assumptions, the levelized rate would go down to $0.48. However, Foothills pro forma model has some questionable assumptions (e.g. 0% Opex and Capex escalation). I will send you (Mary Kay) assumptions comparison sheet in separate mail. I still couldn't reconcile the $0.05 difference.

If anyone has any comments or questions, please let me know.

Thanks,

Normally, I'd say let him call you.  

I'm not worried about my relationship with Dennis but I am conscious that Stan is developing a relationship with Kvisle.  

I have no reason for changing our position on making no collective response to Sen. Murkowski during the telecon with Dennis at 5pm.  

Dennis believes that Enron's name is essential and that adopting a passive attitude with the politicians will not serve our interests on A==>B, which could damage our opportunities on B==>C.

Danny,

Here's a quick summary of the bullets I discussed with Dennis.  He was not happy about the last one, in particular.

Liability issues are overwhelming - - - GP role is just not feasible until residual claims go away.
We are prepared to exchange our residual claims for AFUDC + interest accruals for the right to become a 9.4% GP at some later date, say commencement of construction or time of certificate.
We want the partnership to make an all out effort to recover historic capital contributions either in rates or as an amortizable asset; likewise, we recognize that AFUDC and interest accruals are sunk.
If we don't rejoin as a GP, we will walk away from AFUDC and interest accruals but want to be reimbursed historic capital contribution.
Not comfortable with making any collective response to Sen. Murkowski.  We will make our own.

Eric, if I'm reading this correctly, they rejected the suggested changes to Par. 3.  They did eliminate the ROFR paragraph.  We may want to get on the phone with PGT, El Paso, Sempra before the Tuesday call.  DF

Please find enclosed a revised draft of the ANNGTC MOU reflecting the
discussions held in Houston on Wednesday morning.  Please note in
particular clause 3 which differs slightly from the results of our
discussions.  We are advised that the language that is reflected in that
clause now reflects an approach that is both commercially and
politically necessary to prevent unwanted legislative action in
Washington.  We look forward to discussing this with you on Monday
afternoon at 1:30 P.M. Calgary time.

Thanks for distributing a copy of PG&E's letter.  Likewise Duke's letter,
which was signed by Bobby Evans, is attached below.  FYI - - I met
face-to-face with each of the three principle ANS producers' executives (of
Phillips, BP and ExxonMobil) last week in Anchorage to advise them of
Duke's position before filing our letter.

Mr. D. McCarty
Managing Director and Chief Commercial Officer
Enron Corp.

Dear Mr. McCarty,

I am writing on behalf of the Mackenzie Delta Explorers Group who are a
group of seven E&P companies with current and proposed exploration
activities in the Mackenzie Delta area. The member companies include
Anadarko Canada Corporation, Alberta Energy Company, Anderson
Exploration/Devon, Burlington Resources Canada Energy Ltd, BP Canada Energy
Company, Chevron Canada Resources and Petro-Canada Oil and Gas.

We are assessing alternatives to transport natural gas from the Delta to
southern markets and will soon be engaging in a feasibility engineering
design study to assess routing,  construction techniques, optimum sizing,
pressure requirements, capital and operating costs, liquids handling,
gathering systems, environmental considerations and other relevant design
parameters.

We are contacting potential strategic alliance partners in the pipeline
arena to determine the level of interest of  participating in the study
and/or contributing information to the Feasibility exercise.

If you require more information and wish to discuss this in more detail,
please fell free to contact me (403-296-4824) or Rod Maier (Chevron Canada
Resources 403-234-5433).

Thanks for your consideration.

Please see the attached draft letter response to Sen. Murkowski's recent correspondence to Ken.  

The use of "premature at this time" signals that we have really not studied the legislative proposals, which is true. 

Murkowski is keen to preserve ANGTA and keep new enabling legislation off the agenda.

If you are satisfied with this response, I will prepare an original for signature.

I agree that this represents our conversation of yesterday and should be submitted to the other teams.  Two small edits: Under "The Pipeline" (1)the sub heading should be "Receipt/Delivery Points" and (2) I would be more comfortable if "Toll" read "Illustrative Toll".  Bob Hill.

likes Enron's comments, but I'm also open to deferral discussions on Monday

Gentlemen,

Yesterday, Enron provided comments on the MOU which raise several new
issues of substance. TransCanada & Westcoast recommend that these matters
be deferred and included with our discussions on the commercial proposal
and the Partnership Agreement, as we have agreed on a number of other
issues.

As we discussed on Tuesday's conference call, we believe the first priority
for ANNGTC is to finalize the MOU now, & put it "on ice", to permit all
parties to obtain the required governance approvals by Nov. 15 - also the
press release would be drafted, circulated & approved and ready to go at
that time.

Secondly, the commercial proposal to ANS Producers must be initiated in
early November to meet a mid-Dec. deadline. This proposal will of necessity
have the group addressing the large commercial alternatives in order to
establish a viable and attractive project.

We recommend a conference call on Monday @ 1:30 PM (Mountain time) to
finalize the MOU - we will arrange a dial-in #.. Please provide your
comments on the MOU to Murray & I today.


Tony

Joe H. and I were both on the Friday conf. call arranged by Dennis regarding the press release in response to the introduction of the Producer's enabling legislation in the Senate.  Nothing worth reporting.  None of the companies (except perhaps TCPL) thought that a press release should be issued so the release idea was dropped.  The companies' DC reps are going to start meeting re Alaskan matters and I believe Joe Hartsoe will cover those meetings for Enron. 
Danny here is my weekly report.  Last week I attended the Calgary meetings (2 days). I will attend the Los Angeles meeting of the commercial group on the 12th.  We hope to agree on the model assumptions and finish the proposal before Christmas.  An early January meeting is planned with the Producers to go through the commercial proposal which will now have several binders of detail attached to the proposal.  I will forward the executive summary of the draft proposal.  Bob Hill.

Bob,

I missed the conference call that was rescheduled to 3:30pm - - - anything of merit discussed?

Also, I circulated the draft press release to Joe Hartsoe and Gina Taylor for comments.  What's the deadline?

Hello,

I am in the process of establishing a Contact List for the Withdrawn
partners.  Would you please check the information I have on you and confirm
that it is correct and would you supply any information that is missing.

Also, would you indicate what function each individual is responsible for
eg. , MOU, Technical, Regulatory, Commercial or Legal.  I will update the
list once I have more information.  Thanks very much for your help.

I agree that this represents our conversation of yesterday and should be
submitted to the other teams.  Two small edits: Under "The Pipeline"
(1)the sub heading should be "Receipt/Delivery Points" and (2) I would
be more comfortable if "Toll" read "Illustrative Toll".  Bob Hill.

Dennis,

Thanks very much for the draft.  In principle, Enron supports your efforts to enhance the value of the ANNGTC partnership through this initiative with the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.  Having reviewed your letter, we offer the following comments for your consideration- 

- In the second sentence of the opening paragraph, substitute "continued progress" for "substantial progress".
- In the first sentence of the second paragraph, substitute "these developments" for "this significant development".

We believe the letter should end with the second paragraph, which would deliver a very positive message.

Regards,

Eric Gadd

Gentlemen, I believe I was able to contact most of you , or your
representatives, earlier today to discuss developments in Washington and
how that impacts the merits of sending the attached letter to Senators
Bingaman and Murkowski.
The current draft reflects the advice of ANNGTC/Foothills' political
counsellors as well other comments recieved through the week. Its
language is more direct and assertive on laying out the staus of our
commerical process,but does , I believe, overstate matters either. The
only intent here is to try all we can do to ensure that the legislative
status quo is maintained as we complete the re-enlistment and move
forward with a commerical proposal to the North Slope producers. To the
letter the maximum weight it does specifically refer to each of
re-enlisting partners by name as being aligned with this letter.
My office will be organizing a teleconference for 10:30 am est tomorrow
to finalize on what basis this letter can go forward. The various port
numbers will be conveyed to you via both email and telephone.
Welcome any comments through the rest of the afternoon and evening.

All,

In the rush to get this MOU completed, Foothills and TCPL have addressed the attached letter to Stan Horton as a single counterparty to the MOU, which is not the agreed way forward.  The MOU will be revised
again to reflect the fact that all of the parties will appear on one
document--not each party executing only with TransCanada, Westcoast and

Please review and provide comments.

I have reviewed the ANNGTC confidentiality agreement (the two page letter agreement included in the package) and have several comments.  I've attempted to briefly explain the basis for each change in brackets after the change.  I'm circulating these by this email so you all can jump in if you have further comments.  Please give me a call if you have any questions or comments.  DF

--in the second paragraph, line 2, after "concerning" add: ", without limitation,"  [I don't know exactly what the disputed issues under the old partnership agreement are at this time, and don't want this signed letter agreement used as a basis for someone's claim that we've waived an argument.]

--second paragraph, lines 4-9:  delete the sentence beginning with "Furthermore" and ending with "Partnership."  [This sentence serves no purpose but to assert an interpretation of section 4.4.4 of the Partnership Agreement.  Since that section apparently (Foothills and Westcoast believe) limits the rights of the withdrawn partners, I'd prefer to let section 4.4.4  speak for itself and not have us sign any documents that arguably endorse any parties' interpretation of that language.]

--page 2, line 1:  after "(b) your" add:  "execution of this agreement and".  [I'd like to broaden our protection so our signing of this letter agreement cannot be argued to constitute a waiver of any argument or otherwise compromise our position.]

--page 2, Section 2.(c), line1:  after the words "not be used" add:  "by the Receiving Party".  [Any party that currently has information should be able to use that information for any purpose it wants in the future--including as evidence in a fight about the Partnership Agreement.  That should be true whether the party having such information chooses to disclose it to someone else under this letter agreement or not.   The restriction on use should be limited to that information that a party obtains solely due to another parties' disclosure pursuant to this letter agreement.  I suspect that's what they intended, but it needs clarification.]

Please find enclosed a revised draft of the ANNGTC MOU reflecting the
discussions held in Houston on Wednesday morning.  Please note in
particular clause 3 which differs slightly from the results of our
discussions.  We are advised that the language that is reflected in that
clause now reflects an approach that is both commercially and
politically necessary to prevent unwanted legislative action in
Washington.  We look forward to discussing this with you on Monday
afternoon at 1:30 P.M. Calgary time.

I am just  getting caught up on the last few days e-mail.  This article, "Money Issue Threatens to Plug Alaska Highway Gas Route", was sent to me on Monday - I don't know if it has shown up in Gas Daily; however, I was surprised to see the past investments of the Alaska Northwest Natural Gas Transportation Company being referred to as "the meatball"; that "oil company lobbyists have been hyping the meatball issue to spike the Foothills project"; and, that everywhere on the Hill - people know about it.

El Paso and PGT that we are not going to rejoin until the old liabilities a=

I had lunch with Dennis McConaghy.  He outlined three topics of interest that TCPL would like to take up with Enron-

Alaska Highway Project.  TCPL is keen to acquire Enron's residual interest in the ANNGTC partnership most urgently.  Their timetable is driven by the pace of political events (new enabling legislation was introduced in the Senate yesterday).  I disclosed that-
-ETS does not consider ANNGTC to be a strategic investment
-Enron Corp owns the residual interest
-the bankruptcy court would approve terms of disposal of the residual interest
-the sale of the residual interest is not a high priority for Corp given current operating circumstance
Bob Hill and I have been working on a plan to dispose of Enron's residual interest in the ANNGTC.  We're investigating if residual claims can be sold without being encumbered by liabilities accruing prior to Northern Artic Gas Company's withdrawal from the partnership.  We have canvassed other partners and there is definite market interest (Williams, PGE, Sempera).  I will follow up with Kim Wilkie to determine how to work thru the creditor committee and advise you of findings.

Northern Border.  TCPL is still interested in acquiring Enron's interests in NBP (GP and LP units) and are prepared to work on our timetable.  This is not urgent from their perspective.  Please advise if you require further assistance from me to progress.  I have not canvassed the market for other interest but would not be surprised if other pipelines are interested in bidding. 

McNeill Bullet.  TCPL would like to modify the principles of the joint development.  They propose the following-
-substitute Northern Plains for Enron in the joint development agreement
-stay silent on the equity splits at this time 
-leave open the possibility of Northern Plains being Enron's investment vehicle in the future
-TCPL is comfortable with Northern Plains being the operator
-restrict development activities to properly scoping the pipeline facilities and promoting the project
I believe there is merit to using Northern Plains as our development vehicle on certain conditions: (i) it does not go into bankruptcy; and (ii) it remains affiliated with the ETS pipeline group (access to corp capabilities).

Subject: ANGTS Commercial Proposal - STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL


At yesterday's meeting of the ANGTS Commercial Team, it was agreed that
Dave, Cavan and I would continue to work together to modify the commercial
proposal's executive summary over the next two weeks so it can be sent to
the ANS producers on the Friday just before Xmas.  In advance of next week's
meeting in LA, we will incorporate comments made yesterday (some of which
are listed below) as well as any points conveyed to us by the close of
business tomorrow.  Attached is the exact same version of the document
discussed yesterday (in case you did not receive the soft copy the previous
evening).  Please feel free to provide your comments by e-mail.
 <<ANGTS_Proposal_Dec6.doc>> 

*	ANS producers want a pipeline capable of transporting 4.0 to 5.5
bcf/d; 4.0 to 4.5 bcf/d initial volume at Prudhoe Bay.
*	Provide a basket of pipeline design options; namely, a 42-inch,
2,050 psig line capable of transporting 2.5 to 5.3 bcf/d (loop sections
being necessary to achieve volumes above 4.0 bcf/d) and a 48-inch, 2,050
psig line capable of transporting 3.1 to 5.3 bcf/d; also provide the lowest
per unit cost means of transporting gas to market.
*	Indicate how fuel consumption will impact the optimum pipe platform,
assuming a fuel cost of US$0.75/MMBtu.
*	Provide a range of traditional cost-of-service tolls that includes
historic costs (US$385 mm total) and provides for 14% ROE; consider
including capital cost per decatherm of throughput capacity; tolls will not
be a binding offer.
*	Emphasize that the ANGTS "B-to-C" strategy is consistent with NPA
and ANGTA.
*	Describe each "asset" (certificates, permits, legislation, etc.)
underpinning the ANGTS timing advantage; reduces risk and increases
certainty.
*	Provide an estimate of the value of the ANGTS timing advantage.
*	Address specific strategies for dealing with each contingent
liability on the theory that used and useful capital will be credited at
start up.
*	Express a willingness to discuss producer equity participation and
risk sharing.

I want to call your attention to the Meeting Notes #6  attached to this letter from the TCPL rep., Tony Palmer.  Last Wednesday TCPL made a run at throwing out of the Alaskan Project the historic costs (ie more than just the AFUDC and accrued interest).  I objected on behalf of Enron. However, as the notes indicate only TCPL thought it was a good idea, the others generally felt that as a "going in" position the costs had to be included in the Alaskan project  or they would never even be considered for inclusion by the Producers.  Note however that if negotiations ever get started between the ANNGTC Pipeline and the ANS Producers, the historic costs could again be an issue.  Bob.

Danny,

Here's our comments-

Paragraph 1
ANNGTC's FERC Form 2 filing says that they have received rate base approval for approx. $470 million of past investment (not including AFUDC).  It is unclear how the total cash investment of the withdrawn partners relates to the $470 million number in the Form 2. 

We acknowledge that releasing any and all potential claims against the ANNGTC Partnership is an important principle to adopt to secure commercial commitments from the ANS Producers.  In principle, we are prepared to release claims for the accrued AFUDC component but are not prepared to release claims for the $470 MM of past investment because regulators may allow a recovery mechanic, which could present future upsides to the Withdrawn Partners.  We thus propose to modify this principle to provide for the inclusion of the $470 MM, but specifically exclude the AFUDC component.  Ultimately, the toll for transport services will result through negotiations with the ANS Producers, and their concerns can be addressed by expressly excluding surcharges/other regulatory mechanics approved by the regulators for the initial investments.

Par. 1, footnote **
Each ANS Producer that joins will cause the Current and Rejoining Partners' interests to be reduced pro rata, irrespective of when the new partners join.  We should discuss limits on the rights of new partners to join, or a limits on the dilution.  Section 5.2.1 of the partnership agreement sets out a mechanism that discounts the percentage interest acquired by a new partner depending on how long after initial formation that partner joined.  If that mechanism is still in effect, any ANS Producer who joins will face the unpleasant surprise that his interest will immediately be discounted by 15%.

Paragraph 2a
We have no information supporting $10 MM of costs incurred by TCPL-USA and UAFC-Foothills for 2000 and 2001.  The language is ambiguous on what will happen to the "costs incurred by TCPL-USA and UAFC-Foothills prior to 2000."  How much money did they spend and are they offering to write it off?  Does our payment of our pro rata share of the $10 million permanently absolve us of responsiblity for those costs or have they been buried in the accounts of the partnership somewhere?

Paragraph 2b
The idea of a "success payment" implies that an entirely new set of customers for the pipeline will be found and new contracts executed.  At one time Northern Natural was a shipper and we believe may have signed a precedent agreement or binding contract (we think the original partners agreed to also contract as customers).  We haven't seen the agreements, but assume they are dead.  If not, we need to kill them. 

Enron believes it is inappropriate for TCPL-USA and UAFC-Foothills to obtain a success payment/distribution equal to US$40 MM.  The parents of both companies will enjoy the benefit of increased revenues resulting from volume flows on B==>C segments owned by themselves, which should be a significant financial incentive.

[NB: We could advance the idea of asking for an option on participation on the B-C leg next week if Foothills and TCPL won't back off on demanding the $40 million.  I'd prefer not to put this in writing yet.]  

Paragraph 3
While we would like to to preserve the potential ability of the Partnership to seek to include the entire balance of capital contributions plus AFUDC/interest in rate base, since that is almost US $4b, doing so would crater the project's economics.  Instead, preserving just the project's ability to include in rate base the $470 MM that FERC has already blessed may be a more reasonable amount and also have the benefit of prior FERC approval.  

Paragraph 4
A Rejoining Partner who subsequently withdraw should be allowed to recover its capital contributions without interest/AFUDC at some future date, preferably the first day of commercial operations.  New Percentage Interest will revert to all partners in proportion to their respective current percentage interests.

Paragraph 5
Enron would like to eliminate this principle.  It would be appropriate for change of control principles to be developed.

Paragraph 7
Please clarify the principles in which the Partnership Agreement will be amended in order to "modernize" provisions for the management of the ANNGTC Partnership.

Paragraph 8
We couldn't find "equalizing partners" referenced as a defined term so we're not sure what this paragraph is talking about.  It might be referring to the "Additional Capital" provisions of Par. 12, but that's just a guess.  

Paragraph 10
Enron can not agree to the principles in a) and b)

Paragraph 11
William's acquisition of NAPC introduces a material change in control and needs to be discussed.  The size of ANNGTC is such that it could hire its own pipeline operating management and staff in Alaska.

[NB: We need to determine when William's acquired control of NAPC.  Drew is investigating.]

Paragraph 14
We'd like to take this out of whatever MOU we end up signing for the same reason we took it out of the confidentiality agreement.  This is just a paraphrase of the withdrawing partner provisions of the Partnership Agreement, coupled with some speculation about what might happen 5 or more years from now.  It doesn't need to be in the MOU.  The only thing this language accomplishes is potentially exposing us to an argument that we waived some rights or were on notice of some claim or position if we end up in a fight with Foothills, TCPL or the Partnership.  

Balance of MOU
Ok.

New this week -- the A to B steering group split itself into 3 teams and worked up Commercial Proposals to the ANS Producers. The plan is to consolidate the three into one proposal, get management approval and then submit to the Producers in mid-late December.
Our next meetings are in Houston on 11/28 and in Calgary on 12/04-05.  I am conflicted on the Alaskan Governor's breakfast in Anchorage on Nov. 30th. Eric is checking his availability for the trip.

I contacted the Mackenzie Valley Pipeline study group.  My PetroCanada contact was out for the week and has not returned my call.

The B to C JV is set to receive the JV agreement from TCPL and will discuss same on a call tomorrow 11/26.  I will sit in with Eric at a meeting in Calgary on 12/06 on the Nova toll/facilities for the link that TCPL is excluding from the JV.  Do we know who is constructing the ex-Alberta Canadian segment that feeds B to C ?  If that segment is built by Foothills it  serves up the question of why we are using prior ANGTS certificates in Alaska and Canada but not in the lower 48 states ?

Danny,

Here's a quick summary of the bullets I discussed with Dennis.  He was not happy about the last one, in particular.

Liability issues are overwhelming - - - GP role is just not feasible until residual claims go away.
We are prepared to exchange our residual claims for AFUDC + interest accruals for the right to become a 9.4% GP at some later date, say commencement of construction or time of certificate.
We want the partnership to make an all out effort to recover historic capital contributions either in rates or as an amortizable asset; likewise, we recognize that AFUDC and interest accruals are sunk.
If we don't rejoin as a GP, we will walk away from AFUDC and interest accruals but want to be reimbursed historic capital contribution.
Not comfortable with making any collective response to Sen. Murkowski.  We will make our own.

Tony,

Peter is traveling today, and I am providing comments for him.  Please
replace the third sentence of paragraph 2 of Foothills' letter with the
language below.  Our revisions reflect the language we agreed to regarding
elimination or release of claims against the partnership, IF COMMERCIALLY
NECESSARY.  We are not otherwise willing to support the letter.  

"TransCanada, Foothills and the withdrawn partners are committed to
eliminating commercial barriers to construction of the ANGTS.  Accordingly,
if commercially necessary, they will release contingent claims against the
Alaska Partnership related to previous investments."


Please call with any questions or comments you may have.  Lauri.

I can make a good case for $3.5 to $7 MM but it depends on how receptive the ANS producers are to the commercial proposal.

Tony + Kim,

Several of the rejoining partners of ANNGTC have contacted me asking if Enron is interested in selling its residual claims.  The answer is most definitely affirmative.  Please advise on the following-

What are the bankruptcy court's requirements to undertake a mandated auction?
Is it possible through the bankruptcy court to extinguish liability claims arising prior to NAGC's withdrawal from the ANNGTC partnership?  If so, how?

Here's how I would like to proceed-
Prepare an offering letter that identifies what we are selling and preferred terms + conditions
Distribute to each partner, possibly other interested parties (ANS producers)
Obtain bids and evaluate best offer

I would like to begin the sales process asap and would appreciate your feedback most urgently.

I just got off the phone with Byron Wright.  El Paso is definitely interested in acquiring Enron's residual rights in the ANNGTC.  He's trying to work out a structure that he can get approved at Somerhalder's level, eg <$10 MM.  He's thinking about a proposal that offers cash at various milestones, possibly an up front amount followed by additional payments when the ANS producers sign up and the partnership agreement is amended and restated.  He does not want to be left out of the auction and asked me to call back before agreeing a deal with anybody else.

Would you be willing to make an offer at say, $12 MM to get things going?

Please see the attached red-line with our comments.  

In paragraph 8, I've proposed new language to address that pre-existing residual claims must be satisfactorily addressed before a new partnership agreement would be executed.  Also, I've outlined the possibility for other forms of ownership than just a partnership.  

In paragraph 9, I've outlined a non-exhaustive list of issues to be addressed in the joint development and coordination agreement.

During the next round of discussions following the MOU, I would like to explore the merits of rejoining partners having the right to rejoin as either a developing or non-developing party.  The outline structure I propose would be as follows-
- In either case, ownership levels are as set out in the MOU
- A developing party would have full voting rights and full financial responsibility during the development phase
- A non-developing party would make MOU payments but otherwise not have voting rights or financial responsibility
- A non-developing party could become a developing party at a specific time in the future and upon specific terms
- Non-developing parties would agree to release their claims for AFUDC and interest to the extent commercially necessary

Regards,

Eric Gadd

Rod,

We looking for your help on some ideas on how to implement a good long term=
 project that has negative short term cash flow.

We have been working with Halliburton to identify deliverability improvemen=
ts at Redfield through the use of  improved technology related to identifyi=
ng poor performing wells and implementing down hole remediation.  This proj=
ect has costs and revenues as shown below that are great from a long term s=
tandpoint.  Steve Thomas and Maurice Gilbert have done an excellent job of =
identifying the benefits to NNG and the upsides in revenue that are expecte=
d.  Dave Waymire has also been very helpful in analyzing alternative and ec=
onomics and have shown that the project has a great return (in excess of 30=
%).  Our problem is that the cost for the workovers at Redfield are all O&M=
 expenses and not capital and we have a negative IBIT for the first 2 - 3 y=
ears of the project.  We have proposed that Halliburton structure the expen=
ses such that they come in over a 5 - 10 year period so we don't have this =
negative IBIT flow in the first years, however, Halliburton has not been in=
terested and has proposed a 30% finance charge for this structure.

What would be the appetite for possibly pre-paying a majority of these cost=
s in '01 to avoid the negative '02 and '03 earnings impact or is there an E=
nron company that would finance/extend the expense payments.  This is a gre=
at project that we should do, however, it is difficult given the negative e=
arnings impacts in the first couple of years.  Got any ideas to handle this=
 financial hurdle??????

I am scheduled to be in Calgary next week and will cover the ANNGTS presentation by Foothills on Tuesday. The subject is detailed discussion of the ANGTS schedule advantages over a greenfield project.  On Wednesday I will attend the commercial steering group meeting to work on the proposal to the ANS producers.   Unless TCPL cancels, I will have a meeting with their rate department  to hear about the Alberta tolls for the Nova system that will link the A to B and B to C projects.  Bob Hill.

Danny, I am forwarding you this summary of two conversations last week in Calgary.  Also I believe Eric had a similar talk with Dennis in Houston.   I want to emphasize that in sending this message out I was simply acting as meeting secretary regarding what was said last week.  It is clear to me that Stan wants to call these shots.  Bob.

Subject:	B to C Joint Venture

This is my effort to write up the concepts that were discussed last Tuesday night by Paul MacGregor, Hank Petranik, Bill Cordes and myself. While possibly incomplete, the thoughts also include items from a brief discussion with Byron Wright and Donna Friesen.  If El Paso and Trans Canada wish to pursue these ideas further,  they should take them up directly with Stan Horton as Stan indicated recently that he wants to make the decisions related to Enron's position in the JV.  I would also ask Janet Place and Donna Friesen to review these thoughts and to offer their comments.  Bob Hill.


B to C Joint Venture Term Sheet with Northern Plains Natural Gas (an Enron subsidiary)

TransCanada, El Paso and Northern Plains Natural Gas Co. will jointly sponsor a Monchy to Chicago gas pipeline intended to transport Alaskan natural gas volumes to midwestern markets  (the "JV").

Terms of Participation for Northern Plains:

During the period of project development, prior to construction of Project Facilities, NPNG will not be required to contribute capital to the JV project.  All JV capital requirements will be met during this period by El Paso and TransCanada.

NPNG employees will perform various project development services as requested by the JV.  The JV will reimburse NPNG for all out of pocket costs incurred by NPNG on behalf of the JV.

NPNG shall have an opportunity to become an equity owner of the JV's B to C pipeline in a percentage not less than that to be owned by El Paso.   NPNG's investment opportunity will extend until the time that mainline construction of the B to C pipeline commences.           ( Would the closing date of the JV's debt funding be a better date to terminate the investment option by NPNG ?)

The price for NPNG's ownership investment would recognize the actual capital previously invested by the other owners, the time value of such invested capital from the time of investment to the date of NPNG's investment.

Included in the NPNG arrangement would be a clause providing that if there was a change of control of NPNG to a party other than TransCanada or El Paso, then Trans Canada and El Paso would have a right to terminate NPNG's investment option, or, if applicable, to repurchase NPNG's ownership position.

To the extent that the JV elects to utilize the Conditional ANGTS Certificate issued by the FERC to Northern Border Pipeline Company in the JV's FERC application, then the JV will pay to Northern Border Pipeline Company  compensation for the value, if any, of such  conditional certificate.

Hi Eric,  Cordes debriefed me on last week's call with TCPL regarding the "McNeill to Chicago bullet" pipeline.  As I understand it you and Danny will lead Enron's participation in a joint venture with TCPL (and possibly others) on this bullet.  FYI, Omaha prepared the cost estimate and rate calculations for the US portion of what TCPL showed to you on September 27th and will be happy to give you and Danny behind the scene support related to those numbers, or anything else we can assist you with.

All,

Herewith my attempt at summarizing comments and building a collective response from our conference call earlier this week.  Please review and comment asap.  I would like to start feeding responses into Tony Palmer and Murray Birch on Monday.

Paragraph 1
Enron aknowledges that releasing any and all potential claims against the ANNGTC Partnership is an important principle to adopt to secure commercial commitments from the Alaskan gas producers.  In principle, Enron is prepared to release claims for the accrued AFUDC component but is not prepared to release claims for the initial ~$300 MM because regulators may allow a mechanic to recover the earlier investments, which could present future upsides to the Withdrawn Partners.  Enron thus proposes to modify this principle to provide for the inclusion of the ~$300 MM investments, but specifically exclude the AFUDC component.  Ultimately, the toll for transport services will result through negotiations with the Producers, and their concerns can be addressed by expressly excluding surcharges/other regulatory mechanics approved by the regulators for the initial investments.

Paragraph 2

Paragraph 2a
Enron would like to change this principle to include an immediate cash payment equal to such Rejoining Partner's pro rata share of the lesser of-
i) US$10 MM and
ii) properly documented and audited costs incurred by TCPL-USA and UAFC-Foothills during the years 2000 and 2001

Paragraph 2b
Enron believes it is inappropriate for TCPL-USA and UAFC-Foothills to obtain a success payment/distribution equal to US$40 MM.  The parents of both companies will enjoy the benefit of increased revenues resulting from volume flows on B==>C segments owned by themselves, which should be a significant financial incentive.

Paragraph 3
Conform to comments outlined above in Paragraph 1.

Paragraph 4
A Rejoining Partner who subsequently withdraw should be allowed to recover its capital contributions without interest/AFUDC at some future date, preferably the first day of commercial operations.  New Percentage Interest will revert to all partners in proportion to their respective current percentage interests.

Paragraph 5
Enron would like to eliminate this principle.  It would be appropriate for change of control principles to be developed.

Paragraph 6
Ok.

Paragraph 7
Please clarify the principles in which the Partnership Agreement will be amended in order to "modernize" provisions for the management of the ANNGTC Partnership.

Paragraph 8
???

Paragraph 9
Ok.

Paragraph 10
Enron can not agree to the principles in a) and b)

Paragraph 11
Arguably, all the partners in ANNGTC would be capable of becoming the pipeline operator in Alaska.  The size of ANNGTC is such that it could hire its own pipeline operating management and staff in Alaska.  Enron believes it is inappropriate to appoint NAPC as the pipeline operator in Alaska and that it would be a straightforward exercise for ANNGTC to appoint an Operator by utilizing a competitive process amongst the Partners.

Paragraphs 12 and 13
Ok.

Paragraph 14
Enron proposes to eliminate the principle as stated and conform to the comments outlined above in Paragraph 4.

Balance of MOU
Ok.

Please see the attached draft letter response to Sen. Murkowski's recent correspondence to Ken.  

The use of "premature at this time" signals that we have really not studied the legislative proposals, which is true. 

Murkowski is keen to preserve ANGTA and keep new enabling legislation off the agenda.

If you are satisfied with this response, I will prepare an original for signature.

Imbalance	~3.0 Bcf/d

Reasonable people can have different perspectives on this, but this indicates that infra-structure reinforcements and expansions is required downstream of the Alaska Highway Pipeline.

Michael Ratner: please have Jebong Lee liase with Julie Gomez to validate this gas balance.

Good morning Drew, here is a Confidentiality Agreement draft prepared by TransCanada to cover a joint venture by Enron, El Paso and TransCanada to build a new high pressure line from the Canada-US border to Chicago.  Please arrange to have the CA reviewed by yourself or one of your staff attorneys. If you need to discuss this with a TCPL attorney I would start with Donna Friesen  (403)920-7957.

Please find enclosed a draft CA for the McNeil bullet work for your
review.  I would like to highlight a couple of points;

- we had talked about a press release being issued by mid-December
during our initial meeting in Houston on Nov. 9.   The CA as currently
worded would require all parties concurrence on any press release.  In
meeting the spirit of the CA, TransCanada would like to state that it
would like to meet that deadline for issuing a press release and would
ask each of you to indicate whether you would support that or not.  We
will have some points available within a week outlining what we feel the
release would say but it would be similar to what we discussed
previously.

- on the issue of entities to be covered by the CA, we would ask that El
Paso consider a corporate entity rather than ANR.  Our reason is that
resources are likely to be seconded from groups other than ANR within El
Paso and we would like the CA to cover all relevant entities and
personnel directly than indirectly through ANR.

As a final note, the first draft of the Joint development agreement
should be ready late Wednesday.  Recognizing that Thursday is a holiday,
the draft should be on your email by Friday morning for your review. -
thanks - Paul

Gentlemen,

Herewith Enron's initial comments on the proposed MOU.

Paragraph 1
ANNGTC's FERC Form 2 filing says that they have received rate base approval for approx. $470 million of past investment (not including AFUDC).  It is unclear how the total cash investment of the withdrawn partners relates to the $470 million number in the Form 2. 

We acknowledge that releasing any and all potential claims against the ANNGTC Partnership is an important principle to adopt to secure commercial commitments from the ANS Producers.  In principle, we are prepared to release claims for the accrued AFUDC component but are not prepared to release claims for the $470 MM of past investment because regulators may allow a recovery mechanic, which could present future upsides to the Withdrawn Partners.  We thus propose to modify this principle to provide for the inclusion of the $470 MM, but specifically exclude the AFUDC component.  Ultimately, the toll for transport services will result through negotiations with the ANS Producers, and their concerns can be addressed by expressly excluding surcharges/other regulatory mechanics approved by the regulators for the initial investments.

Par. 1, footnote **
Each ANS Producer that joins will cause the Current and Rejoining Partners' interests to be reduced pro rata, irrespective of when the new partners join.  We should discuss limits on the rights of new partners to join, or limits on the dilution.  Section 5.2.1 of the partnership agreement sets out a mechanism that discounts the percentage interest acquired by a new partner depending on how long after initial formation that partner joined.

Paragraph 2a
We have no information supporting $10 MM of costs incurred by TCPL-USA and UAFC-Foothills for 2000 and 2001.  The language is ambiguous on what will happen to the "costs incurred by TCPL-USA and UAFC-Foothills prior to 2000."  How much money did they spend and are they offering to write it off?  Does our payment of our pro rata share of the $10 million permanently absolve us of responsibility for those costs or have they been buried in the accounts of the partnership somewhere?

Paragraph 2b
The idea of a success payment implies that an entirely new set of customers for the pipeline will be found and new contracts executed.  Enron believes it is inappropriate for TCPL-USA and UAFC-Foothills to receive a success payment.  

Paragraph 3
While we would like to preserve the potential ability of the Partnership to seek to include the entire balance of capital contributions plus AFUDC/interest in rate base, since that is almost US $4b, doing so would crater the project's economics.  Instead, preserving just the project's ability to include in rate base the $470 MM that FERC has already blessed may be a more reasonable amount and also have the benefit of prior FERC approval.  

Paragraph 4
A Rejoining Partner who subsequently withdraws should be allowed to recover its capital contributions without interest/AFUDC at some future date, preferably the first day of commercial operations.  New Percentage Interest will revert to all partners in proportion to their respective current percentage interests.

Paragraph 5
Enron would like to eliminate this principle.  It would be appropriate for change of control principles to be developed.

Paragraph 7
Please clarify the principles in which the Partnership Agreement will be amended in order to "modernize" provisions for the management of the ANNGTC Partnership.

Paragraph 8
Please explain what is intended.

Paragraph 10
Enron can not agree to the principles in a) and b).

Paragraph 11
William's ownership of NAPC needs to be discussed.  The size of ANNGTC is such that it should hire its own pipeline operating management and staff in Alaska, which we recommend.

Paragraph 14
We'd like to take this out of the MOU for the same reason we took it out of the confidentiality agreement.  

Balance of MOU
Ok.
