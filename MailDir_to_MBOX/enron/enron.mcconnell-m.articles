NOAA Sees Cold Winter Ahead 
The United States can expect another colder-than-normal winter, with temperatures similar to last winter, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said in its winter outlook, confirming recent private forecasts, most notably that of Salomon Smith Barney Meteorologist Jon Davis earlier this week.
For most of the United States, winter 2001-02 will feel like a sequel to last year's cold season, NOAA said, with sharp swings in temperature and precipitation, including heavy lake-effect snows in the Northeast and Midwest, cold air outbreaks in the South, and the potential for Nor'easters along the East Coast. 
NOAA said the absence of a strong El Ni?o or La Ni?a climate pattern leaves the door open for a highly variable winter, which will impact the winter weather extremes such as cold, snow, rain and ice that the nation may experience. 
"We don't expect a repeat of the record-breaking cold temperatures of November-December of last year, but this winter should be cooler than the warm winters of the late 1990s," said Scott Gudes, NOAA's acting administrator. "Citizens should prepare for the full range of winter weather." 
Climate factors that influenced last winter will play a similar role this season. They include the Arctic Oscillation, which influences the number of cold-air outbreaks in the South and Nor'easters on the East Coast, and the Madden-Julian Oscillation, which can impact the number of heavy rain storms in the Pacific Northwest. 
"This winter, NOAA's improving technologies will help National Weather Service forecasters -- for the first time -- pinpoint when these factors will kick in and bring extreme weather," said Jack Kelly, director of NOAA's National Weather Service. 
Colder-than-normal temperatures are expected in the Northeast. Snowfall for the entire region will depend on the fluctuations of the Arctic Oscillation. The Mid-Atlantic states have equal chances of above normal, normal, or below-normal temperatures and precipitation. Storm tracks could bring more snow than the winters of the late 1990s, but this largely depends on the Arctic Oscillation, NOAA said. The Southeast should be drier than normal. Temperatures have an equal chance of averaging above normal, normal or below normal. 
In the upper Midwest and Great Lakes, temperatures should be lower than normal, with more sub-zero days than the average of recent winters. There are equal chances for cumulative precipitation to be above normal, normal, or below normal. The northern Great Plains and Rockies should see below-normal temperatures with more sub-zero days than experienced on average during the winters of the late 1990s, but wet and mild weather is more likely for the southern Plains. 
The central Rockies can expect equal chances of above normal, normal, or below-normal precipitation and temperatures. In the Northwest, there are equal chances for above normal, normal, or below-normal rain and snow. Heavy coastal rain events are more likely compared to the previous three winters. A repeat of the near-record dryness seen last winter is unlikely. NOAA said to expect warmer-than-normal temperatures in most of the Southwest (except western California) and equal chances of above normal, normal or below-normal precipitation.

NATURAL GAS PRICES REBOUND AS HEATING SEASON APPROACHES

Despite high storage levels, with heating season coming, the Henry Hub cash 
market has bounced back from early October lows to levels near $2.40 per MMBtu. 
However, weak market fundamentals, including a sluggish economy and increased 
US and Canadian supplies, will mitigate the usual winter price rise. CERA 
expects an average Henry Hub price of $2.35 in November.

*  Although inventories are close to record levels, storage pressures are 
increasingly unlikely to drive cash markets down significantly this year. 

*  Gas demand will average 14 percent lower than a year earlier; residential 
and commercial sectors show a decline with a return to normal weather, while a 
weak economy offsets the return of ammonia and dual-fuel loads in the 
industrial sector.

*  Regional storage inventories and weak regional demand should keep upward 
pressure off of regional differentials. The Northeast examines security issues 
around LNG shipments.

Subject:	CEC Infrastructure Report

The California Energy Commission has issued its final report on the California Infrastructure which is to be voted upon by the Commision on Wednesday.  Below is a summary of the report that was in Inside Ferc and attached is a copy of the full report (123 pages).  There's an executive summary at the beginning which is about 10 pages.  Although, as stated in the summary, the Commission found a lack of sufficient capacity on El Paso as a contributor to high prices, they do not take on the issue of market power as had been suggested by the CPUC and other commenters and blame the pipeline for such prices.  Instead they cite El Paso capacity problems as one of several factors which caused high prices last winter.  I'll keep you advised as to what happens on Wedneday at the CEC meeting.  gh



IN NEW REPORT, CEC COMMITTEE KEEPS EMPHASIS ON IN-STATE GAS CAPACITY
Constrained interstate gas pipeline capacity was just one of the factors that led to high natural gas
prices in California last fall and winter, according to a report issued last week by a committee of the
California Energy Commission. The revised final report on gas infrastructure issues notably skirted the
issue of market power as a factor in the gas price spikes that rocked the state.
After taking into consideration comments from the California Public Utilities Commission and others,
the report to the full CEC concluded that a number of factors were involved. "Insufficient receipt capacity
within California and insufficient capacity on the El Paso [Natural Gas Co.] pipeline system both contrib-uted
to the high price of natural gas in the fall and winter of 2000," the Sept. 24 report said. The CEC is
scheduled to vote Wednesday on the report.
The revised version took into account scarcity on the El Paso system but did not place the blame
entirely on that, noting the high demand for gas-fired electric generation and relatively low storage levels
during times of high gas prices. "As a result of the insufficient capacity both to and within California,
buyers were less able to force suppliers to bid against each other. Whether prices during this period were, in
whole or in part, the result of a free market's rationing of scarce suppliers through a scarcity premium, or
entirely the result of price manipulation, is beyond the scope of this report," wrote Commissioner Michal
Moore, presiding member of CEC's electricity and natural gas committee.
Pointing to the high-profile CPUC complaint (RP00-241) against El Paso Corp. pending at FERC, the
CEC added that it had "every confidence that the interests of California ratepayers will be well-represented
by the CPUC."
The report pointed to the fact that California shippers surrendered large blocks of capacity on the El
Paso system in recent years. "The shortfall in capacity was absorbed by California, and not the upstream
customers. This is due, in part, to the decision a few years ago by California to turn back part of its rights to
firm capacity on the El Paso system. It is also due to the failure by El Paso to honor its contractual commit-ment
to deliver capacity paid for by California," the report noted.
Moore's committee had postponed issuance of the report after receiving comments on a draft version
from the CPUC, The Utility Reform Network and Southern California Edison Co., which all called for
consideration of allegations that El Paso exerted market power over gas sales into California (IF, 27 Aug,
1). The draft pointed to insufficient takeaway capacity in California and called for slack capacity in the
range of 15% to 20% (IF, 13 Aug, 4).
The report went on to suggest that California "can no longer plan for the future as if we lived in a
regulated, cost-plus environment. Under price regulation, adverse hydroelectric conditions and extreme
temperatures did not lead to extreme price spikes. Under today's conditions, that is no longer the case."
Moore added that the state's "virtual complete reliance" on gas for electric generation has contributed to
the new dynamics surrounding capacity planning.
More than 100,000 Mw of gas-fired generation proposed for the Western Systems Coordinating Council
region demands expansion of the regional pipeline grid, the report continued, saying the CEC was "encour-aged"
by recently announced expansion plans by interstate pipelines and FERC's stated intent to expedite
review of such proposals. The report also noted that Southern California Gas Co. is developing 375,000 Mcf/
day of additional receipt capacity, which should be ready by the end of the year. Also, Pacific Gas and Electric
Co. plans to add as much as 600,000 Mcf/day of capacity by 2003, according to the report.
It observed that intrastate pipelines, in particular those in Southern California, ran at close to full
capacity at times this and last year, which created bottlenecks in delivering supplies from interstate
pipelines to gas consumers, including electric generators in 2000 and early 2001.
High prices in the future could be held at bay with the in-state expansions and the CPUC's recent approval
of SoCal Gas' plan to remove 37 Bcf of cushion and working gas from three storage fields in Montebello and
Aliso Canyon in Los Angeles County and La Goleta in Santa Barbara County (IF, 2 July, 3).
In addition to strongly emphasizing intrastate needs, the report recommended that the state "analyze
the consequences of the increasing upstream gas demands on the El Paso pipeline system as they affect the
flows of natural gas and electricity" between California and the Southwest U.S. and Mexico.
According to the report, the state also should: encourage in-state gas production; re-evaluate design criteria
for the intrastate system in consideration of growing power generation demand; consider gas curtailment
mechanisms; "optimize" storage; and encourage the creation of new storage facilities in the state.
The 123-page report is available on the CEC's Web site (www.energy.ca.gov/reports/index.html).

NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
published : October 29, 2001
ALJ Clears Transwestern of Market Power Charges 
A FERC administrative law judge has found no improprieties, nor evidence of the exercise of market power in negotiated rate contracts between Transwestern Pipeline and two shippers on its system, which resulted in the shippers being charged as much as $27/MMBtu last February, far in excess of the pipeline's allowed transportation rate of 38 cents/MMBtu (RP97-288-009). 
ALJ Jacob Leventhal had only one fault to find, and that was with Transwestern's method of posting capacity. The judge said, and Transwestern agreed, to modify its tariff "so that all posting, bidding and award procedures are set forth in a separate provision with an appropriate caption" on its Internet bulletin board. Shippers had said that reviewing capacity on the Transwestern web site was "a tortuous process." 
Indicated Shippers claimed Transwestern's inadequate capacity posting and award procedures did not provide all interested parties with an opportunity to bid for the capacity that was available. 
While "both Indicated Shippers and (FERC) Staff find it curious that SET (Sempra Energy Trading) and Richardson (Products Co.) were the sole bidders on the contracts awarded to each of them...curiosity does not translate into proof," the judge said. Witnesses in the expedited hearing testified no bids were considered in advance of the capacity posting.  The judge subsequently found the capacity was awarded in a manner consistent with Transwestern's tariff. 
Similarly, Levanthal could find no evidence that Transwestern exercised market power in negotiating the rates with shippers or withholding or threatening to withhold capacity. The capacity was available at recourse rates, and the shippers knew those rates were available. "Staff's arguments really are criticisms of the posting and award procedures, but do not demonstrate the exercise of market power." 
The two shippers said they made a business decision to propose the "index-to-index" formula that produced the higher rates, rather than take the recourse rate "to minimize any risk on transportation options." The index-to-index formula refers to taking the difference between the daily published commodity prices at two different points and subtracting to get the transportation rate between them. In this case the two points were the San Juan Basin and the SoCal Needles delivery point. 
The case was set for expedited hearing last summer by the commissioners acting on staff recommendations.

Note:  I have the Western Frontier certificate filing if anyone wants to see it.  LB
Petal Expansion, ANR Lateral Extension, Transco's Leidy Project OK'd 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued several important certificates Wednesday for new gas pipeline infrastructure projects, including final approvals for Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line's Leidy East expansion in Pennsylvania, for a new pipeline by Petal Gas Storage in Mississippi and for an ANR lateral extension to serve to 1,050 MW Badger power plant in Kenosha, WI. The Commission also denied rehearing of its orders granting Kern River Gas Transmission certificates to expand its system by about 135 MMcf/d. 
Transco's $98 million Leidy East pipe expansion project would make up for the failed Phase III portion of its MarketLink expansion. The Leidy East project will provide up to 130,000 Dth/d of transportation from Leidy, PA, to northeastern markets in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. The expansion consists of six pipeline loop segments that amount to 26 miles of 42-inch diameter pipe and about five miles of 30-inch diameter pipe mostly in western Pennsylvania. The project also would add 3,400 hp of compression in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. 
"The Commission's authorization is being granted based on our findings...that the proposed facilities will serve the public interest by increasing the pipeline capacity reaching the northeastern United States, thereby helping to meet the rapid growth in electric generation demand in that market," FERC said in its draft order. "Since the overwhelming majority of the proposed facilities will be constructed either entirely within or immediately adjacent to existing pipeline or utility rights of way, the project's environmental impact will be minimized. Finally Transco's existing customers will not subsidize the project because the expansion shippers will pay an incremental rate." 
Transco said this summer that it expects the Leidy East facilities to be in service by November 2002.  The Williams subsidiary said Aquila Energy Marketing (25,000 Dth/d), PECO Energy Co. (30,000 Dth/d), Reliant Energy Services (25,000 Dth/d) and Williams Energy Marketing (50,000 Dth/d) are all customers. The incremental reservation rate for service on the expanded facilities is $13.56/Dth/month. 
The certificate granted to Petal Gas Storage LLC (see related story) covers a new pipeline that would extend 59 miles to a connection with Southern Natural at a compressor station near Enterprise, MS. The $94 million project also includes a new 9,000 horsepower compressor station. The project is designed to deliver 700,000 Dth/d of gas to Southern Company's gas-fired generation in the Southeast. 
ANR Pipeline's lateral extension will carry about 210 MMcf/d of gas to Badger Generating Co.'s proposed power plant in Wisconsin. The project includes 13 miles of 20-inch diameter looping along ANR's Racine Lateral and a 10-mile extension of the lateral to the Badger plant. The project would cost $19.5 million and should be in service during the summer of 2003. 
In the Kern River case, shippers had requested rehearing of FERC's order granting Kern authorization for its 124,500 Dth/d 2002 Expansion Project and an additional 10,500 Dth/d under its revised California Action project. Shippers claimed the project would allow the sale of additional delivery point rights at the Wheeler Ridge point in Southern California causing further pro rata reductions in capacity for existing shippers and diminishing their firm rights. Shippers said the Commission should subordinate the delivery point rights of expansion shippers to those of existing shippers until Southern California Gas builds enough takeaway capacity at Wheeler Ridge to accommodate the additional volumes. 
However, the Commission upheld its initial conclusion that the benefits of the project outweighed any risks of degrading delivery point rights, "given the critical need for expansions of pipeline capacity to serve electric and natural gas infrastructure in California." 
Gulf South Sees Strong Interest in $1 Billion Southeast Pipe 
Houston-based Gulf South Pipeline Co. LP, formerly Koch Gateway Pipeline, on Wednesday said the open season for the company's proposed $1 billion Gulf Pines Pipeline was "extremely successful," adding that response to the 1 Bcf/d line from the Southeast markets far exceeded the company's expectations. The open season concluded on Sept. 19. 
The proposed 600-700 mile, 36-inch diameter or greater natural gas pipeline, which was first announced in August, is expected to originate in Mobile, AL, and extend through the states of Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina.
"The open season clearly confirmed that the demand exists for a competitive alternative to serve the growing power generation, commercial, residential and industrial markets in the southeastern United States," said Gulf South President Rolf Gafvert. 
The Gulf Pines project would interconnect with the existing Gulf South pipeline near Mobile Bay, enabling customers to access not only Mobile Bay supplies, but also gas supplies from Texas and Louisiana, including Venice and the Henry Hub, according to Gulf South, a subsidiary of Entergy-Koch LP. The proposed pipeline also would have access to multiple third-party storage facilities, such as Gulf South's facility in Bistineau, LA. 
"We anticipate that the projected growth of power plants will far exceed existing pipeline capacity in the southeastern region," said Gulf South spokesman Marc Palazzo. 
In addition to serving power generation, the company said Gulf Pines would extend farther east into the Carolinas than any existing interstate pipeline, bringing interstate pipeline service to a region that historically has not had service before. 
Palazzo said the project would be filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission next year. He added that the actual route of the proposed pipeline is still to be determined. Gulf South said the anticipated in-service date is sometime in 2004. 
Gulf South currently owns and operates 8,800 miles of pipeline with 33 compressor stations and 120 major pipeline interconnects extending from South Texas through the Gulf States and into the Florida market area. 
Williams Files to Build 400-Mile Western Frontier Pipe 
Williams Gas Pipeline has filed an application for a new $365 million pipeline that would extend from the Cheyenne hub in northern Colorado to multiple pipeline interconnections in southwestern Kansas and the panhandle of Oklahoma. The Western Frontier Pipeline would consist of 400 miles of 30-inch diameter pipe and 30,000 horsepower of compression. It would transport up to 540,000 Dth/d of gas to markets in the Midcontinent. 
In addition to an interconnection with the Williams Central system, Western Frontier proposes access to other major Midcontinent pipelines, including ANR Pipeline, Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line, Northern Natural Gas, and Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America. Western Frontier also would have access to the growing Oklahoma intrastate markets via the Williams Central system. The pipeline is anticipated to be in service by Nov. 1, 2003. 
"Western Frontier Pipeline is a cost-effective, environmentally responsible way to transport natural gas from prolific Rockies supply basins to markets in the Midcontinent," said Kim Cocklin, senior vice president and general manager of Williams' Central and Texas Gas systems. "We look forward to building this pipeline to help alleviate the current shortage of interstate pipeline capacity coming out of the region, which was recently cited by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.''

UtiliCorp to Re-Acquire and Then Become Aquila 
UtiliCorp United announced plans to buy back the 20% of its trading and risk management arm, Aquila Inc., that it sold to the public earlier this year and adopt Aquila as its corporate name. The move is a strategic reversal apparently prompted by the weakening economy and industry changes. Executives dodged questions as to whether the move was spurred by the financial troubles at the energy industry's largest trading house, Enron Corp. 
On this busy Wednesday, UtiliCorp also released its earnings, and reported that it has entered into an acquisition agreement with a FirstEnergy Corp. subsidiary. 
UtiliCorp said its board of directors voted to make an exchange offer to acquire all of the outstanding publicly held common shares of its 80%-owned Aquila Inc. subsidiary due to the "recent significant changes in the merchant energy sector, the general economy and the impact of these changes on the capital markets." 
"The most significant influence, however, was the realization that greater shareholder value could be obtained by recombining the financial strength of UtiliCorp with the growth opportunities that lie ahead for Aquila," said Richard C. Green, Jr., chairman and CEO of UtiliCorp. "With its larger asset base, earnings potential and cash flow, the combined company will have more efficient access to capital to execute its ambitious plans. Industry-watchers questioned whether some of the spark for the recombining of the trading operation with the hard-asset backed parent, could have been prompted by Enron's current debacle. 
When asked during the conference call if the Enron situation factored in the decision to combine UtiliCorp and Aquila, Robert Green said, "The decision evolved over the recent few weeks as we evaluated the opportunities in front of Aquila, and the current conditions in the capital market. [We] effectively came to the conclusion that if we are going to put Aquila in a position to execute on these opportunities, it is essential that we recombine the businesses and the balance sheets to execute on the opportunities that we see in the marketplace that are precipitated by the decline in the capital markets, and the fact that the equity markets are shutdown." 
"The merchant strategy behind Aquila's rapid growth has been a key driver behind UtiliCorp's achievement of aggressive earnings targets," Richard Green said. "We decided that UtiliCorp shareholders would be better served by embracing the Aquila energy merchant strategy as the company's core strategy, rather than spinning the business off as a separate entity. To symbolize that change in thinking, we intend to adopt 'Aquila' as our corporate name after our exchange offer is completed." The company said in its conference call that it expects to complete the reacquisition of Aquila by "early January." 
Richard Green also said he will take on a new role, effective Jan. 1, 2002, initially as chairman of UtiliCorp and later of the new company that will be formed from UtiliCorp United and Aquila, Inc. Robert K. Green, president and COO of UtiliCorp, will be elevated to president and CEO of the new Aquila. 
UtiliCorp said all public Aquila shareholders will be offered 0.6896 shares of UtiliCorp common stock in a tax-free exchange for each outstanding share of Aquila Class A common stock. Based on yesterday's closing price of $17.99 per share for Aquila Class A common stock and $30 per share for UtiliCorp common stock, the offer represents a value of $20.69 per Class A share of Aquila and a 15% premium to yesterday's closing price of those shares. "Aquila shareholders will have the opportunity to continue to participate in Aquila's growth through their ongoing ownership of UtiliCorp shares, and to receive cash dividends as UtiliCorp shareholders," Richard Green said. 
The offer requires that at least a majority of Aquila's publicly held Class A shares are tendered. After successful completion of the exchange offer, UtiliCorp has committed to complete a 'short-form' merger of Aquila with a UtiliCorp subsidiary. In the merger, each remaining Aquila Class A share will be converted (subject to the exercise of appraisal rights) into the same number of shares of UtiliCorp common stock as are paid in the exchange offer. UtiliCorp plans to file its offering materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission and commence the exchange offer as soon as possible. 
"Over the past year, I have devoted an increasing amount of time and energy to raising other chief executives' awareness of Aquila's broad capabilities," Richard Green said. "We have a unique position in the emerging market that is being created by the convergence of the insurance, capital and energy businesses, combining our expertise in risk management, wholesale energy, structured financing, generation assets and other related activities. We can help clients in countless industries in ways they've never thought of, and that opportunity is largely driving this change in executive roles." 
The company also reported Wednesday that it expects to enter into an acquisition agreement with FirstEnergy Corp. under which UtiliCorp and a financial partner will purchase FirstEnergy's wholly owned Avon Energy Partners Holdings subsidiary, the holding company for Midlands Electricity plc. Midlands Electricity is the fourth-largest regional electricity company in the United Kingdom and serves 2.3 million network customers. UtiliCorp said the transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2002 after receipt of regulatory approvals. In the company's conference call, Robert Green said the acquisition would likely be "strongly accretive" in 2002. 
In releasing its earnings, UtiliCorp followed the strong third quarter results from its Aquila subsidiary and reported earnings per share for the third quarter 2001 were $0.58, up 16% from last year's third quarter after adjusting for the $0.30 gain from the 2000 initial public offering of Uecomm, Ltd. in Australia. The company posted earnings for the quarter of $68.9 million, a decrease from the $74.9 million mark for the same quarter of 2000. UtiliCorp said energy sales for the quarter were $9.3 billion, up 16% from $8 billion during the third quarter of 2000. 
"At Aquila, we continue to see increasing client demand for our risk management solutions," said Robert Green. "In addition, our recent capacity acquisitions are performing beyond our expectations. Our network businesses continue to help fuel our core growth in earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT). Combining that with the solid results from Aquila, UtiliCorp continues to be on track to deliver at least 15% earnings growth this year." 
UtiliCorp CFO Dan Streek said during the conference call that the company expects 2001 EPS to be in the area of $2.95. The CFO added that this "far exceeds" the company's 15% growth target. For 2002 guidance, Streek said the combined EPS for UtiliCorp and Aquila would be around $2.92. 
Earnings before income taxes (EBIT) for the quarter UtiliCorp were led by strong contributions from Aquila as well as the international business segment. Aquila's operations increased from $40.8 million to $44.2 million (net of minority interests of $7.4 million) in the 2001 third quarter, marking a 26% increase. UtiliCorp attributed some of Aquila's growth to the fact that gas and power commodity markets are slowing down, forcing Aquila's clients to focus more on risk and how they can minimize exposure. As a result, Aquila has seen an increase in its client-focused businesses. Additionally, Aquila's December 2000 acquisition of interests in six power plants through its purchase of GPU International have provided stronger-than-expected operating results. 
The company reported that gas trading volumes in the third quarter increased 11%, from 12.1 Bcf/d during the third quarter 2000 to 13.4 Bcf/d. Power volumes increased 98%, from 44 million MWh to 87 million MWh. 
EBIT from international networks increased 57% to $48.5 million from $30.9 million in the 2000 third quarter, excluding last year's gain of $44 million or $.30 per share from the initial public offering of Uecomm, Ltd. The company said EBIT from Canada and Australia increased, primarily due to the full quarter contribution of electric properties in Alberta, purchased on Aug. 31, 2000, and strong performance in Australia related to continued strength in the United Energy business and the addition of AlintaGas, which was purchased in October 2000. 
In the United States, UtiliCorp's networks had EBIT of $47.4 million in the third quarter of 2001, compared to $45.3 million in the 2000 period. The company said the contribution from the St. Joseph Light & Power division, acquired at the end of 2000, was partially offset by higher operating costs.

Note:  This research is in sync with what the utilities and industry representatives were saying at the 
Wisconsin Winter Fuels Meeting--that coal prices are up over last year.  LB

Energy Insight News for Friday, October 19, 2001

Utilities should prepare for higher coal prices

Coal prices in the United States were in a trough for so long-take your
pick, 10, 15, 20 years, according to some-that big users-read, power
producers-may have been lulled to sleep.

Well, folks, the wakeup call is soon to be sounded, and, for some major
players, it may sound like a bugle blast in the ear. 

While spot market prices took off as long ago as July 2000, most major
producers were saved from swallowing the huge run-ups on the spot market
because utilities for the most part use long-term contracts to maintain a
hold on their fuel costs. 

However, while the evidence is strictly anecdotal-no buyer wants to tip his
hand to the competition-this much is known: A substantial amount of contract
coal comes off pact in 2002 and 2003. 

And suppliers, who have toiled under the mantra that they would make up for
low prices by increasing productivity-for example, cutting labor costs-are
raring to get what they believe they deserve. 

One big wild card in the upcoming battle for higher prices is how severe the
country's recession will be. Obviously, a long-term downturn dampens energy
usage so utilities and merchant players don't need to replenish their coal
stocks. Read the entire story at http://www.energyinsight.com.

State Regulations Forces Questar to Cancel Part of Southern Trails 
Salt Lake City-based Questar Corp. went out to bid earlier this month on four new compressors to complete its conversion work on the east-of-California portion of its 705-mile Southern Trails Pipeline from the San Juan Basin to the Long Beach port area of Southern California. The portion of the converted oil pipeline between the California border and the Four Corners Area in New Mexico will open June 1 next year, a Questar spokesman said Monday. 
It is unlikely the almost 300-mile portion of the former oil pipeline in California will be brought into natural gas service due to state regulatory provisions that make it uneconomic for prospect customers to leave their local supplier for part of their gas supplies. Questar currently is looking for optional uses and a potential buyer for that portion of the project. 
Whether any of the pipeline's proposed 110 MMcf/d of supplies gets into California would depend on the takeaway capacity at the border and/or what a new operator on the California side might do with the pipeline, Questar's spokesperson said.

Copper Eagle Conducts Open Season for AZ Storage Facility 
Copper Eagle Gas Storage LLC., a joint event of El Paso Corp. and Pinnacle West Energy, currently is conducting a non-binding open season to assess market interest in a proposed high-deliverability natural gas storage facility to be located west of Phoenix, AZ, in Maricopa County. 
"We haven't decided whether to firmly go ahead with the project" at this point, said Sheri Foote, a spokeswoman with Pinnacle West Energy, a subsidiary of Phoenix-based Pinnacle West Capital Corp. If Copper Eagle should receive the go-ahead, however, she noted it would be the first storage facility to be located in Arizona. She would not give a timetable as to when a final decision would be made. 
The storage facility would have a working gas storage capacity of 3.2 Bcf, with the capability of withdrawing the entire working gas volume in 10 days, and injecting the working gas volume in 20 days. The project, assuming it gets the green light, is expected to be in service by the fourth quarter of 2004. 
The non-binding open season, which began last Tuesday, will run until Oct. 24 at 5 p.m. CDT. For more information about the project and the terms of the open season, go to web site www.coppereagleGS.com <http://www.coppereagleGS.com> or telephone Russ Kovin at (832) 676-5659.

Note:  FYI, we may see less and less information available on federal web sites in the near term.
FERC Limits Public Access to Pipe, Transmission Maps 
Amid concerns over potential terrorist attacks on energy facilities, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is limiting the public's access to maps of natural gas pipelines and electric transmission lines. 
In a statement of policy, the Commission said it would "no longer make available to the public" maps of these energy facilities through the Internet, the Records and Information Management System (RIMS) and the Public Reference Room at its headquarters in Washington, DC. 
Persons wishing to view the maps, however, can make requests under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) at the Commission. FERC staff has been urged to "respond timely to legitimate requests" for such documents. 
The Commission said the ban would remain in effect indefinitely and directed staff to report on the impact of this action on agency business within 90 days. The move by FERC was not as drastic as some federal agencies, such as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which closed down its entire web site last week as a precaution. 
Given the anthrax scares on Capitol Hill and elsewhere, a spokeswoman said the Commission also has been instructed to alert security immediately about suspicious envelopes and packages.

Initial ALJ Decision in Transwestern Case Delayed 
FERC Chief Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner Jr. has extended by two weeks the deadline for an initial decision in the case in which Transwestern Pipeline is alleged to have arranged more lucrative negotiated-rate deals last winter prior to posting available firm transportation capacity to its web site -- a move that extracted higher rates and limited the capacity availability for recourse-rate shippers for service to California. 
Due to "scheduling conflicts," Wagner pushed back the deadline for president ALJ Jacob Leventhal to issue a decision to Oct. 30 from Oct. 15. 
FERC ordered the hearing in late July to determine whether Transwestern exercised market power in arranging negotiated-rate contracts for capacity that led to some shippers being charged up to $27/MMBtu in February, which the Commission estimated was "70 times the recourse rate."

Press Release
Charter, DIVA Expand Agreement to Deliver Video On Demand to a Total of 1.7 Million Customers
ST. LOUIS, Mo. and REDWOOD CITY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 18, 2001-- 
DIVA's Dominance of Commercially Deployed VOD Markets 
in the U.S. Surpasses 60 Percent 
Charter Communications Inc. (Nasdaq:CHTR  - news ), the nation's fourth-largest cable operator, and DIVA(TM), the video-on-demand solutions leader for the cable TV industry, today announced a new agreement that will expand the total number of Charter customers capable of receiving VOD via DIVA's software and hardware solutions to 1.7 million. 
Building on their existing agreement, Charter and DIVA will bring VOD to new markets across the country, continuing the strong momentum of DIVA's VOD rollouts in the U.S. This rollout follows recent Charter deployments in St. Louis and three of the 10 largest U.S. television markets: Los Angeles, Fort Worth and Atlanta. Charter is deploying the service on both Scientific Atlanta and Motorola digital set-top boxes. 
``Although it's early in the deployment cycle, we're already seeing significant benefits from Video on Demand,'' said Steve Silva, Senior Vice President of Corporate Development & Technology for Charter Communications. ``VOD is a compelling return for our investment, both from incremental revenue and customer retention. Charter believes DIVA's integrated solutions, repeatable implementation process and high quality of support and service enable us to provide our customers with the best VOD service available today. From the comfort of their homes, our customers can experience the convenience of gaining access to a large library of DVD-quality programming content with full VCR functionality, a service that our satellite competitors cannot duplicate or provide.'' 
``We have remained committed to delivering the most comprehensive, easy-to-use VOD solutions to the cable industry. The additional Charter deployments have significantly expanded our agreement and have enabled DIVA to maintain its position as the leader in VOD,'' said Henk Hanselaar, President and CEO of DIVA. ``Charter is a key partner for DIVA because of its aggressive approach to providing consumers with the most advanced digital cable offering today. Charter's ability to roll out VOD services and provide high-quality support to its customers make it a leader in the cable community. We are pleased to serve more Charter customers and look forward to continuing our goal of deploying VOD in more neighborhoods across America.'' 
With DIVA's technology, Charter's customers have complete control over their viewing experience and, with VCR-like capabilities, can watch new releases, classic films and basic and premium cable programming including Discovery Channel, PBS and ESPN, as well as children's programming. Charter and DIVA are also exploring the opportunity to offer content via Subscription Video On Demand (SVOD) packages. With SVOD, a customer would have unlimited access to view titles within the SVOD package, without incurring additional fees. 
Today's announcement of additional rollouts in key markets affirms the high level of commitment both DIVA and Charter share in delivering the best VOD solutions today.

Second CA Merchant Storage Field Pushes Back Opening 
California's second merchant underground natural gas storage project near Sacramento began injecting supplies this month, but its commercial start-up date has been pushed back to Dec. 1, according to the California operations manager for Houston-based Western Hub Properties LLC, the developer. 
Although it is not fully subscribed more than half the capacity is under contract, according to Jim Fossum, the in-state manager for Western Hub, which was purchased last summer by a partnership of Aquila Inc and ArcLight Energy Partners Fund in a $220 million deal that is still several months away from approval from the California Public Utilities Commission. 
The Lodi Storage Project near the town of Lodi, CA, about 35 miles south of the state capital, will have "high-performance, quick-cycle-capabilities" in a project that stores 12 Bcf of natural gas with a 500 MMcf/d withdrawal rate and 400 MMcf/d injection rate. 
Fossum said Western Hub also is pursuing a second merchant storage project in the southern half of the state around Bakersfield in the Wheeler Ridge area close to the nexus of all the major interstate natural gas pipeline coming into California. That project, he said, is not included in the Aquila partnership purchase at this time, and will be developed initial by a still-to-be-named company using some of the same personnel that developed Lodi. 
The same group also has a potential storage site identified in Texas, near San Antonio.

      Washington -- Greg Simon, who spearheaded the cable open access effor=
t here for America Online Inc. after leaving the Clinton White House, has s=
igned up to lobby for Enron Corp., the Houston-based energy trading company=
 with close political ties to the Bush administration.  Simon, a top media =
and telecommunications adviser to Vice President Al Gore who founded his ow=
n lobbying firm called Simon Strategies, filed a lobbying registration form=
 with the clerk of the House of Representatives on June 18.  He also regist=
ered Simon Strategies assistants Kristan Van Hook and Ann Morton as Enron l=
obbyists. On the registration, Simon said he planned to lobby the White Hou=
se, Congress, the Commerce Department and the Federal Communications Commis=
sion 'in furtherance of national policies that support competitive access b=
y content providers to broadband communications networks.'  Simon declined =
to discuss his Enron duties, except to say he was lobbing for the company d=
irectly, indicating that Enron was not joining Simon's OpenNet coalition, t=
he group once funded by AOL to pressure the FCC and Congress to impose open=
 Internet access mandates on the cable industry.  'I am not registered to d=
o [Enron's] press for them. You have to talk to them about what they want t=
o say to the press. That's not what they want me to do unless they give me =
the go-ahead to do that,' Simon said in a phone interview. Enron is a $100 =
billion energy services company with a broadband services division. The com=
pany signed a video-on-demand deal with Blockbuster Inc., but the deal coll=
apsed in March with both sides blaming the other for the venture's failure.=
  Enron chairman Kenneth Lay is longtime informal adviser on energy issues =
to President Bush. He was one of 212 individuals who each raised $100,000 f=
or the Bush campaign and Enron provided corporate jets for Bush campaign of=
ficials, according to U.S. News and World Report. Wendy L. Gramm, wife of S=
en. Phil Gramm (R-Texas), is an Enron board director, according to Enron's =
company web site.  U.S. News also reported that Enron empolyees gave $1.3 m=
illion to the GOP last year. It also stated that three Bush administration =
officials - senior adviser Karl Rove, Vice President Cheney's chief of staf=
f I. Lewis Libby, and top economic policy adviser Lawrence Lindsey - each o=
wned at least $50,000 in Enron stock, though Rove has moved to sell the sha=
res.  Sources said Simon is planning to revive the open access issue on beh=
alf of Enron and the Walt Disney Co. and perhaps expand the effort to inclu=
de nondiscrimination by cable operators against unaffiliated interactive te=
levision providers. Enron did not return phone calls seeking comment. A Dis=
ney official has said repeatedly that the company has made no decision abou=
t joining any open access or ITV coalition.  A source who recently met with=
 Simon said Simon indicated his Enron job would deal with open access to ca=
ble facilities. 'What he said suggested to me that he has had conversations=
 with [Enron and Disney] and it does seem that those companies have somethi=
ng in common on open access,' the sources said.  Another source said Enron,=
 which owns an 18,000 mile global fiber optic network, was looking to deliv=
er content from its network to end users over the last mile controlled by c=
able and phone companies.  'Their interest is, essentially, access to the l=
ocal loop,' the source said. Cable industry sources said they were puzzled =
by Simon's latest move and didn't have a clear sense of where he would begi=
n to apply pressure.  One cable industry wag quipped: 'Enron is a major con=
tent provider -- of oil, gas and electricity.'  All Simon would say is that=
 he is 'representing Enron Broadband directly.  Anything more you have to t=
alk to Enron about. I make it a habit not to put words in my client's mouth=
.'  =09

Broadband trims down at Enron 
But quarter's profits increase 40 percent 
By MICHAEL DAVIS 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 
Enron Corp. will continue to scale back its money-losing broadband business, shifting personnel back into its high-growth energy segments, the company said Thursday. 
It will be the second time in four months that Enron has scaled back its broadband business. The company disclosed its intentions as part of its second-quarter results, which included a 40 percent rise in net income. 
Enron officials still expect the company's broadband business to be a core segment for the company but it has yet to deliver the sort of growth they once envisioned. A deal with Blockbuster that fell through earlier this year was considered a major setback. 
Enron's broadband business reported a $102 million operating loss, compared with an $8 million operating loss for the same quarter a year ago. 
Enron said it would significantly reduce spending in its broadband unit "to match the reduced revenue opportunities currently available." 
Analysts were not surprised by the company's move to reduce its exposure to the broadband market in the near term. 
"This is just a recognition of reality, not just with them but in general," said Daniel Tulis, energy analyst with Bank of America Securities in New York. "This has been a business that has taken a lot longer to materialize and it has affected everybody. It's just been total devastation in the industry across the board." 
In April, Enron Broadband Services eliminated up to 250 positions to reflect a softening broadband market. This latest cost reduction will result in more jobs being shifted from the broadband unit's 900-person work force into Enron's energy business, said Jeffrey Skilling, Enron's chief executive officer. 
"We just need to get the burn rate down, so we are going to redeploy people," Skilling said. 
Skilling said he remains "absolutely convinced" that broadband is going to be an enormous market for Enron one day but said the company has to adjust to the bandwidth glut the market is experiencing. 
Overall, the Houston company had second-quarter net income of $404 million, or 45 cents per share, on revenues of $50 billion. That compared with net income of $289 million, or 34 cents per share, on revenues of $16.8 billion in the second quarter of 2000. 
The company topped Wall Street's expectations slightly. Analysts had expected the company to earn 42 cents per share in the quarter, according to estimates compiled by Thomson Financial/First Call in Boston. 
Enron told investors that it is now confident it will achieve earnings per share for the year of $1.80, and the company said it expects to earn $2.15 per share in 2002. 
The 2002 estimate is up about 20 percent from what most analysts were projecting for next year. 
Shares closed Thursday at $49.55, up 45 cents. 
Enron's wholesale services business, which includes energy sales and trading, has consistently led the company in growth and operating income. In the second quarter, it had operating income of $802 million, up 93 percent compared with the $415 million it earned in the second quarter 2000. 
The standout for the quarter in this division was Enron's European operations, which showed a 103 percent increase in natural gas volumes and a 463 percent increase in power volumes. 
Enron's retail energy services division had operating income of $60 million in the second quarter compared with $46 million in the previous year's second quarter. In the second quarter, $7.2 billion of new contracts were completed, the company said. 
Enron's transportation and distribution business, which includes its natural gas pipelines and its Portland General electric utility, had operating income of $77 million, which was exactly the amount it earned in the comparable quarter last year.
