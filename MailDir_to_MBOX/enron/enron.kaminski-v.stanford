   Sorry about the delay in responding.   It's the end
of the quarter and I'm teaching 3 courses, so things are
very busy, plus I had to work on a response to the FERC
Proposed Order for California.  Here is my student's CV.

Vince,

  I am writing about a student of mine who is on the job market
this year.  When you stopped by my office, about 18 months ago
you asked if I had any students that might be appropriate for
your group.  Although I didn't at the time, now I do.  This student has
excellent technical skills, including an M.S. in Statistics
and a Ph.D. in Economics by the end of the current academic
year.  His dissertation research is on the investment behavior
of Independent Power Producers in the US.  As a result of research
assistance he has done for me, he knows the California market very well
and is familiar with the other ISOs.  I think he would be an excellent
match for you.  The only problem is that he will probably have many
other options available.  However, I definitely think he's worth a look.
If you'd like him to send you a CV, please let me know.  Thanks.

catch you

Subject: Visit to Enron



Hello Vince,

It was nice seeing you at Stanford and many thanks for the lunch
we had together. I really enjoyed our discussions, both at the
technical level and otherwise.

I promised to send you an e-mail regarding possible dates for
a visit to Enron. I delayed it for a week till my schedule was
clearer. Let's see if we can get a match with your schedule -
mine is rather terrible:

Friday, 21st of April looks good. But April 23rd is Easter
Sunday, so that may make it difficult for some people at Enron
to be around. Let me know if that is the case. I am willing to
visit then, because the week after that I am scheduled to be in
Japan and in the previous weeks I am all committed on Fridays.

Friday, 19th of May is the next possibility, but this probably
is too far out. The main problem is that I am operating within
a window of opportunity for attracting top students for this
research. This window closes by the end of April, and it would be
important for the student support funds to be in place then, so
that I can make hard commitments to students and attract top
talent. I am already reviewing files of students who have
approached me for PhD advising, and I am in a mode of doing "soft
commitments to star-level students" to get this research and its
potential on their radar screen. Top students are highly sought
after by advisors and I want to be an early player in this
competition.

Does my visit to Enron have to happen before we can set up the
project and student support at Stanford? If so, doing it before the
end of April is important for getting top people. If the visit can
happen after we get the ball rolling, then we can schedule it in May.
I assume there will be multiple visits both ways when the project gets
going. Please let me know what you think.

Best Regards,

Nick

Hi Vince,

Unfortunately, I have not heard from him.  He also forwarded his resume to Mauricio Mora, who asked if we could interview him.  When I asked Celeste about it back then she decided against it.  If you need some help tracking him down, let me know.

Dear Vincent,

As I told you on the phone on Friday, I am very interested in a summer
internship at Enron. I would like to point out that I want to pursue a
career in trading, and I am especially interested in derivatives. Given that
Enron is a pioneer in the market making of energy, broadband and weather
derivatives, I find it a company I would be most interested in working for.

I believe that you will find my background of interest to your firm, and I
hope to be interviewed by yourself and other colleagues of yours. I have
final exams from March 19-22, but would be most willing to travel to Houston
for interviews any time from Friday March 23rd onwards. I hope to hear from
you soon.

Dear Celeste and Stinson,

I am writing to refuse Enron's offer for a summer position.  After several
conversations with my advisor at Stanford, we have decided that I should
remain at Stanford to work on my dissertation.

Thank you again for taking the time to show me around Enron.

Sincerely,

Thank you for your message. I shall be glad to meet with you on May the 4th.
I shall ask my assistant, Shirley Crenshaw (713) 853 5290, to call you to set 
up the meeting.

Also, for your information, we have recently set up a special unit to 
coordinate Enron's
relationships with the universities. The person running this unit is Christie 
Patrick.
Please, feel free to contact her and give my name as a reference. I shall

Dear Dr. Kaminski,

Let me briefly introduce myself, I am the Director of Corporate Relations
for the School of Engineering at Stanford University.  In this role, I am
always on the watch for ways to bring our faculty together with companies
that have an appetite for engagement with top tier research institutions.

I believe you know Hill Huntington, who is a senior researcher with
Stanford's Energy Modeling Forum.  He suggested I get in touch with you for
some ideas about contacts at Enron.  I'm in the process of planning a trip
to Texas in early May along with my colleague Donna Lawrence, the
university's Director of Corporate Relations.  We were hoping to be able to
include a stop at Enron on our itinerary. Right now it appears that Friday,
May 4th would work best for us but we're at the very beginning of our trip
planning.

The purpose of our visit would be to review the current relationship
between Enron and Stanford, to give you an overview of current priorities
in the School of Engineering, and ask for your help in identifying the best
points of contact.

I look forward to hearing from you about your availability,

Sincerely,
Susan Hansen

Hello Nick:

I agree  e-mail is much easier.

There is a two-hour time difference between Calif and Texas, i.e., 1:00 pm 
Texas Time - 11:00 am Calif time.

Would tomorrow at 11:00 am Calif time be ok with you (1:00 pm Texas)?  
This time is fine for Vince, Tom Gros and Stinson Gibner.

Can they call you and if so, what number?

Please let me know.

Thanks!

Shirley,

It's easier to communcate by e-mail, since I am moving from
meeting to meeting (but I have the laptop always with me).

Please give me a phone number that I could call tomorrow.
What is the time difference between California and your
location? I think it's 2 hours (CA->TX) - is that right?

I can do the conference call any time from 9-11 CA time.
Would that be OK on your side?


Thanks,

Nick

Vince,

Sounds like there are several Enron people very interested in our
seminar.  Many thanks for passing the idea around.

Do you think that these groups might provide some sponsorship?  I didn't
know whether you have already asked them and they are thinking about it or
whether I need to approach them directly.  I would appreciate any
suggestions you have.

Mr Huntington
We at the New Power Company are very interested in participating in this 
conference.  We are going through a major initiative to shed light on the 
benefits of real-time pricing and determining the price elasticity of various 
components of retail demand.  Kindly include us as participants in this 
conference.  Sincerely,

Hi Vince, Stinson

Thank you for hosting my visit to Enron and arranging for me to meet
with you and other decision-makers at Enron. The meetings been very
productive on my side, as I try to formulate the project more
clearly.

We are entering the period that I have to set up the Research Assistantships 
(RA)
for next year for Giuseppe and the other student I have committed to support
on this project. School starts in late September, but already I have to
start putting together the papers for the RAs in the Fall, as per departmental
requirement.

Would it be possible to put the project in place soon, so that I can
do the RAship papers for the students? I expect I will start having
pressure from the department to do the paperwork for these RAships early
September, and I have to have them in place by the third week of September,
just before school starts.

I am attaching below the same DRAFT of a letter I had sent you in a previous
e-mail, which would be required to set up the project at Stanford. Please,
let me know how you would like to proceed.

Again, thanks for your hospitality and I look forward to productive 
collaboration
during the coming year and beyond.

Best Regards,

Nick


PS: Vince, I look forward to seeing you during your visit to the Bay Area
in October.

I would like to invite you to participate in a conference on "Retail
Participation in Competitive Power Markets" to be held at Stanford
University on June 21-22, 2001. Although California and other regional
markets will likely be introducing some demand-response programs by June,
there is a clear need for continual evaluation of these nascent efforts to
transform the market. The conference provides an opportunity to learn from
different experiences.

This policy research meeting will focus on establishing a foundation for
understanding the key concepts and methods for demand response programs and
to provide an opportunity for participants to raise questions and recommend
directions for additional research and analysis.  Participants will come
from companies, government, and universities.  You can obtain more
information about the conference by checking under "Meetings" on our EMF
website listed below.

Please let me know if you plan on attending.  Also, if you would like to
make a brief 15-minute presentation, please let me know your topic and
describe it in a few sentences.  I will try to choose speakers that will
cover the full range of interests represented by this group.  Researchers
should focus on the implications of their analysis for designing demand
response programs rather than on the technical details of their
methodology.  I would also encourage practitioners to discuss their
experience in implementing demand response programs or in raising selected
issues.

Thank you,
Hill Huntington

Hi Vince,

Unfortunately, I have not heard from him.  He also forwarded his resume to 
Mauricio Mora, who asked if we could interview him.  When I asked Celeste 
about it back then she decided against it.  If you need some help tracking 
him down, let me know.

Dear Vincent,

As I told you on the phone on Friday, I am very interested in a summer
internship at Enron. I would like to point out that I want to pursue a
career in trading, and I am especially interested in derivatives. Given that
Enron is a pioneer in the market making of energy, broadband and weather
derivatives, I find it a company I would be most interested in working for.

I believe that you will find my background of interest to your firm, and I
hope to be interviewed by yourself and other colleagues of yours. I have
final exams from March 19-22, but would be most willing to travel to Houston
for interviews any time from Friday March 23rd onwards. I hope to hear from
you soon.

Stinson,

Should we get him as well?
It seems he has the right skills. 
We might have maxed out on the
number of summer interns through
the A/A program. We would have to
hire him directly.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank each of you for your 
participation in the Stanford Associate interviews last week.  Our efforts 
resulted in 6 summer associate offers and 1 full-time associate offer.  
Althea Gordon will be e-mailing you the names of the individuals who will 
receive offers.  We would like you to contact these individuals to 
congratulate them and encourage their acceptance.  Althea will match you up 
with the candidates you interviewed and provide you with contact information.

Althea has verbally contacted both the offers and the declines.  We will be 
sending out both offer letters and decline letters by end of day Tuesday, 
March 20.  In the meantime, should any of you be contacted by students who 
did not receive an offer, I recommend the following verbal response:

"Our summer program is highly competitive, forcing us to choose a smaller 
number of candidates from a highly qualified pool.  Our summer hiring this 
year will be between 35-40 associates.  The full-time program typically hires 
between 80-90 associates.  Given that you made it this far in our selection 
process, I would strongly encourage you to apply in the fall for the 
full-time associate program."

We will keep you informed via e-mail of our acceptance rate at Stanford.

Again, thank you for your support.  We look forward to working with you on 
potential future Stanford recruiting events.

Regards,
Celeste Roberts

Dear Mr. Kaminski:

Thank you for talking with me about a possible RTP conference.  I would
like to include some discussions of what has been learned in other industries.

As I indicated, Frank Wolak suggested that I contact you.  In discussing
power markets with Frank and other colleagues at Stanford and EPRI, it
seems quite evident that real-time pricing for retail customers is the
"forgotten resource" in more efficient power markets.  There seems to be a
lot of confusion about what RTP means and it also seems that many
researchers need to address some practical but important problems.  I was
asked whether a group like Stanford's EMF might explore this topic and give
it the visibility that would have it considered more seriously by
policymakers.

Frank thought that you might be someone who could help me structure a
useful approach and who might also see whether Enron could become a major
sponsor.  I was hoping that this issue was sufficiently important to Enron
that the company might consider providing $25,000.  As you may appreciate,
it requires some thought and effort to make sure that the product of the
conference is widely circulated among key government groups.

I would be very interested in hearing from you if you can provide ideas and
recommendations for people (perhaps yourself or a colleague) to
participate.  I would also appreciate any consideration by Enron of
providing funding for this effort.

Thank you,
Hill Huntington

Dear Vince,

this is great news!  Donna and I are delighted that you have time to see us
on May 4th.

I'll be out of the office next week.  By copy of this email to my
assistant, Carol Lovell, I will ask her to get in touch with Shirley for
scheduling as well as directions on where to meet you.  We'll be glad to
meet with Christie Patrick as well.

Looking forward to meeting you,

Susan

Vince:

Per Susan's email below, do you want to go to the luncheon for John
Hennessey?  She doesn't say where the lunch is going to be, did you
get an invite?

The only thing you have that day is 9:00 AM Larry Thorne and the
Energy Derivatives Class at 11:30.

Let me know.

Thanks!

Hi Shirley,

thanks for corresponding with Carol during my absence, and confirming our
meeting with Vince Kaminski at 1:30 on May 4th.  I have a question about
the logistics.  I believe Dr. Kaminski has received an invitation to an
event in Houston: new Stanford president John Hennessy is visiting a number
of cities on a "welcome tour," and it just so happens he is hosting a
luncheon in Houston on May 4th.  If Dr. Kaminski wants to attend the
Hennessy Welcome Tour luncheon, Donna Lawrence and I could meet with him at
1:30 somewhere in the hotel.  If he's not attending the presidential event,
please let me know where you are located, and we'll plan travel time
accordingly.

Regards,
Susan

Hi Vince,

I am on the technical program committee of the Infocom 2001 conference,
and we are meeting in New York City on Saturday, October 14th, to select
papers for the conference program. I'm leaving Stanford on Friday and
getting back on Sunday.

It might be a possibility to have dinner together on Sunday, if that would
work for you. In that case I would have to reschedule my flight to land
in SFO earlier than I'm currently scheduled to land.

Would dinner on Sunday work for you? Any chance we can meet Monday for
lunch?

I look forward to seeing you.

Best Regards,

Nick

Hi Stinson,

Eventually, the team here (Giuseppe, Eric, myself) has converged to two
possible dates to propose for a visit:

1) Friday, March 2
2) Friday, March 9

How do these look on your side?

We'll structure the agenda immediately after we fix the date.

I look forward to seeing you again.

Darrell,

I am sending you 2 technical notes on Enron default swaps: I hope that they 
will
be useful. I shall read the articles on weekend. I am curious if you
find these explanations satisfactory.

We are very slow in preparing a number of technical documents
for you for model reviews. We still hope you will be able
to find some time to review our credit models (for our London
credit trading) and  VaR and option pricing related models.

Also, please check your invoices. I still think we owe you money.

Vince: According to a Bank of America
publication, your (Enron) default swap spreads
are consistently trading about 80
basis points wider than your asset swaps.
Any idea of what is going on here?

Thanks for any guidance, Darrell

Dr. Kaminski, I would like to thank you very much for taking care of Amy and

during our trip to Houston. What I saw at Enron Communication was nothing 
short
of revolutionary. More than that, I was impressed with the drive of the 
people,
their kindness, and their proficiency. I look forward to meeting you again in

Great! I'm looking forward to a very productive collaboration.
I'll immediately start doing Giuseppe's papers, for him to work
on the Enron/Stanford program.

Many Thanks to you and Vince, and I hope to see you soon at Stanford
or Enron. If I remember correctly, Vince is visiting Stanford in
October.

I'm arriving at the George Bush airport in Houston next Thursday at 5:15pm.
I could then take a taxi to the hotel or the restaurant. How long would it
take me to get there? Is there a "rush hour" problem at that time?

I'm flying out of Houston on Friday at 6:45pm. Is there a rush hour problem
on the freeways at that time? What time should I leave from Enron to be at the
airport at 6pm?

I hope I'll have opportunities to give talks at Enron in subsequent visits
along the research path. In this first visit I was hoping to understand better
the research goals of Enron and brainstorm with people about what are the
top challenges and opportunities for our research collaboration. Identifying
the best research problems in terms of
1) highest innovation potential and
2) highest projected impact
would be at the top of my list. It might be unprofessional on my side to
talk to an audience that I don't have any prior information about and is
very diverse anyway; it could actually be "dangerous." I would feel MUCH more
comfortable to do that in my second visit, after I have understood the 
environment
better and I have some results to talk about. I would like to be in a
position to "impress" people when I give my first talk at Enron. (Besides,
I will have to prepare good slides for such a talk and I am totally swamped
all next week.)

I'm swamped, but I'll try to put something together.

I look forward to seeing you next week.

Subject: Re: Stanford Project =20

Nick,

Hope you had a nice Christmas.  Best wishes for the New Year.  =20

It would certainly be great to see you and to meet Eric some time in the ne=
xt=20
few months.     Everyone here
was very impressed with Giuseppe and we are eager to have another of your=
=20
students come to Enron.

Enron Broadband is continuing to evolve and the current vision is to rely o=
n=20
Enron's trading expertise while trying to
minimize our role as an engineering company and innovator of technology.   =
I=20
spoke recently with Jim Fallon, the current
head trader in EBS, and we put together a short list of topics of interest=
=20
where you might be able to help educate us.
I put these in the order of interest (to Mr. Fallon).

1.   Where will bandwidth prices go?   The direction of prices, obviously i=
s=20
the concern of any trader.   We realize that=20
technological innovation will continue to drive down prices, but are still=
=20
interested in trying to quantify how fast prices will fall, =20
if there are likely to be certain bottlenecks in the fiber network where yo=
u=20
could see prices stable or rising for some length of time, =20
if there are applications on the horizon which would use such prodigious=20
amounts of bandwidth as to have some effect on pricing,=20
and if there is a rational way of trying to quantify the timing and effect =
on=20
prices of new technologies.
 The term "bandwidth" might primarily mean lit fiberoptic capacity, but cou=
ld=20
also incompass dark fiber, or IP transit and transport=20
pricing.

2.  During the last year, Enron purchased a company known as "Warpspeed" in=
=20
order to acquire their MetaRouter technology.   To quote from the Enron pre=
ss=20
release:

"MetaRouter sends signals throughout distributed networks to determine the=
=20
optimal connectivity paths for any size bandwidth capacity from anywhere in=
=20
the world. Capable of processing thousands of connections per second,=20
MetaRouter significantly enhances Enron=01,s ability to automate circuit=20
provisioning."

There may be two separate questions to ask here.   First,  in the context o=
f=20
the current market (or the market which may develop in the next 1-2 years),=
=20
will the MetaRouter be a commercially viable product?   That is,  will it=
=20
address an actual need in the market, or would it be more cost effective ju=
st=20
to use technicians with jumper cables to provision circuits?

The second question (our first real technical question):  is the MetaRouter=
=20
technology scalable?     Before starting on this project, Vince and I will=
=20
need to make the proper introductions with the principles who are=20
implementing this technology.

3.  Aggregation of loads.   A recurring question comes from a number of are=
as=20
such as IP, network storage, and   streaming media transport sales:  What=
=20
value can I get form aggregating customers, each of which has some type of=
=20
stochastic load profile?   Giuseppe touched on this problem as it relates t=
o=20
IP transport, but it may be interesting to try and look in more detail.   =
=20
The main stumbling block may be that we currently have basically no actual=
=20
customer data.   I am told that in a few months we will have some more usef=
ul=20
history.   My understanding is that what will be available will be 5-minute=
=20
averages of usage, so we still will not know on a short time scale what the=
=20
distribution of load looks like.


I hope that this gives you enough information to get some idea of what our=
=20
concerns are at this point.   Please let me know your thoughts about these=
=20
topics.   I would expect, for instance that question number 1 may not be=20
reasonable as a research project, but might be a question which you would=
=20
feel comfortable in addressing by giving us  your qualitative opinions, may=
be=20
in the form of a talk here at Enron.   =20


Again,  let me know your thoughts, and I look forward to seeing you again=
=20
soon.

Stinson

I have formally established the project - thanks again for funding
it - and I have also recruited the second PhD student. His name is
Eric Cope, and he is a top-notch student, very mature, and entrepreneurial!

We have started working on some interesting problems in this area. I would
hope that Eric could spend the coming summer at Enron to get immersed into
the "problem/opportunity generation environment." That really helps the=20
student
to develop a realistic vision about their research.

Perhaps, our whole team could visit Enron again some time in the next quart=
er,
say in March or so, to discuss the research issues we are pursuing. And of=
=20
course
you could visit us before that too.


With my WARMEST WISHES,

Nick

Stinson,

How about Monday, August 21st or Monday, Aug. 28?

Mondays are especially effective, because I would like to
come on Saturday and work over the weekend together with
Giuseppe before the meetings on Monday.

I'm very happy to hear that. He is also very excited to be there working with

Vince,

Here are the overview Powerpoint slides for the investment and strategic
relationship management firm, Azure Capital, I mentioned in my voice
mail.  The transactions they completed in their past lives at CSFB and
already in the new firm, as well as their advisory board are probably
the strongest evidence of their capabilities.

Hope all is well.

Per Susan's email below, do you want to go to the luncheon for John
Hennessey?  She doesn't say where the lunch is going to be, did you
get an invite?

The only thing you have that day is 9:00 AM Larry Thorne and the
Energy Derivatives Class at 11:30.

Let me know.

Thanks!

Hi Shirley,

thanks for corresponding with Carol during my absence, and confirming our
meeting with Vince Kaminski at 1:30 on May 4th.  I have a question about
the logistics.  I believe Dr. Kaminski has received an invitation to an
event in Houston: new Stanford president John Hennessy is visiting a number
of cities on a "welcome tour," and it just so happens he is hosting a
luncheon in Houston on May 4th.  If Dr. Kaminski wants to attend the
Hennessy Welcome Tour luncheon, Donna Lawrence and I could meet with him at
1:30 somewhere in the hotel.  If he's not attending the presidential event,
please let me know where you are located, and we'll plan travel time
accordingly.

Regards,
Susan

this is great news!  Donna and I are delighted that you have time to see us
on May 4th.

I'll be out of the office next week.  By copy of this email to my

scheduling as well as directions on where to meet you.  We'll be glad to
meet with Christie Patrick as well.

Looking forward to meeting you,

Vince,

No problem at all. I fully understand.

The only glitch is that I will be in Europe next week, leaving this Friday
and coming back next Sunday. I'm visiting several companies and universities.
Is it an option for you to schedule your visit to Stanford the first week of
November, so that we can get together and talk about the research program
etc. ?

On another matter now. I have been in contact with Stinson regarding the
program
funds. I am under great pressure from my Department to finalize Giuseppe's
RAship and I am way beyond the deadline. I understand that Paul Racicot
will fund the project and Stinson is doing anything he can to make this
happen.

May I solicit your help and intervention to Paul to have the process
expedited?
I look bad to my colleagues here for not honoring my commitments to the
students
I had promised to support and the pressure on me is mounting exponentially!

Many Thanks,

Nick

For your information and Susan's, Christie Patrick will not be available on the
4th of May.  She will be out of the city.  Maybe Susan can contact her directly
at another time.

I still have 1:30 as the time for Vince and Susan to meet.

Susan,

Thank you for your message. I shall be glad to meet with you on May the 4th.
I shall ask my assistant, Shirley Crenshaw (713) 853 5290, to call you to set up the meeting.

Also, for your information, we have recently set up a special unit to coordinate Enron's
relationships with the universities. The person running this unit is Christie Patrick.
Please, feel free to contact her and give my name as a reference. I shall coordinate the meeting
on May  the 4th with her.

Vince

Subject:	Visit from Stanford?


Dear Dr. Kaminski,

Let me briefly introduce myself, I am the Director of Corporate Relations
for the School of Engineering at Stanford University.  In this role, I am
always on the watch for ways to bring our faculty together with companies
that have an appetite for engagement with top tier research institutions.

I believe you know Hill Huntington, who is a senior researcher with
Stanford's Energy Modeling Forum.  He suggested I get in touch with you for
some ideas about contacts at Enron.  I'm in the process of planning a trip
to Texas in early May along with my colleague Donna Lawrence, the
university's Director of Corporate Relations.  We were hoping to be able to
include a stop at Enron on our itinerary. Right now it appears that Friday,
May 4th would work best for us but we're at the very beginning of our trip
planning.

The purpose of our visit would be to review the current relationship
between Enron and Stanford, to give you an overview of current priorities
in the School of Engineering, and ask for your help in identifying the best
points of contact.

I look forward to hearing from you about your availability,

Sincerely,
Susan Hansen

Nick,

Vince asked me to coordinate the planning for you August visit to Enron.   
Vince and I are free almost any date except August 14 and 15th,  but we would 
like to try and schedule your visit at a time when you could meet with other 
key EBS executives such as Kevin Hannon and perhaps Ken Rice and John 
Echols.    If you could send me a few of your preferred choices of dates, I 
will try to optimize getting you on the calendars of these individuals.   

By the way, Giuseppe is doing a great job and has already made a very good 
impression on everyone he has worked with.  It's been a real pleasure having 
him here for the summer.

Regards,

Stinson

Frank,

I am definitely interested in the resume. I can meet the candidate on campus 
when
I visit my son. I am planning to come to Palo Alto around Thanksgiving.

Also, Energy and Power Risk Management (an English publication)
organizes every year in Houston a POWER RISK conference (typically in May).
They ask me for recommendations regarding
speakers. Would you be interested in participating?

Vince,

  I am writing about a student of mine who is on the job market
this year.  When you stopped by my office, about 18 months ago
you asked if I had any students that might be appropriate for
your group.  Although I didn't at the time, now I do.  This student has
excellent technical skills, including an M.S. in Statistics
and a Ph.D. in Economics by the end of the current academic
year.  His dissertation research is on the investment behavior
of Independent Power Producers in the US.  As a result of research
assistance he has done for me, he knows the California market very well
and is familiar with the other ISOs.  I think he would be an excellent
match for you.  The only problem is that he will probably have many
other options available.  However, I definitely think he's worth a look.
If you'd like him to send you a CV, please let me know.  Thanks.

Hi Vince!

I got those notes. They should indeed
be useful. The one from Deutsche Bank
is especially helpful!

I am suppose to know this stuff, as I teach it!

Sorry about the delayed billing.
I have had trouble getting a bill
from my excellent asistant, Taichi Hoshino,
who has returned to Goldman Tokyo,
and has not been able to get anything else
done lately. I will try to get something out soon!

We had several energy people,
from several companies, at our credit risk
exec ed course last month. Seems that
credit risk and  power risk go
together these days!

Warm regards, Darrell

Dr. Kaminski, I would like to thank you very much for taking care of Amy and 
me
during our trip to Houston. What I saw at Enron Communication was nothing 
short
of revolutionary. More than that, I was impressed with the drive of the 
people,
their kindness, and their proficiency. I look forward to meeting you again in
Stanford during the last weekend of February. I will send you an email next
week, so that we can arrange a meeting between you and Prof. Bambos.
All the best wishes,

Giuseppe

Nick,

I shall be in Stanford Oct 14 - 15, visiting my family.
I would be glad to meet you (and possibly Giuseppe - your call) for lunch.
Please, let mer know if you are free on one of these days. Saturday would
work better for me.

Stinson,

Great! I'm looking forward to a very productive collaboration.
I'll immediately start doing Giuseppe's papers, for him to work
on the Enron/Stanford program.

Many Thanks to you and Vince, and I hope to see you soon at Stanford
or Enron. If I remember correctly, Vince is visiting Stanford in
October.

Best Regards,

Nick,

Thanks for your message. My family is in Houston for the Christmas holidays
and  this means I am not coming any time soon to Stanford.
I shall probably visit the campus for the Parents Weekend. Let's
plan to meet for dinner then.

I am very glad that you have recruited the 2nd PhD student for the research  
project.
We are discussing internally what would be the best topic(s) for the project
and we should be ready to talk to you in the nearest future about it.
It makes a lot of sense for you to visit Enron to finalize the selection
of the research topics.

We shall be glad to take both Eric and Giuseppe as summer interns.
Everybody  was immensely impressed with Giuseppe and we shall 
welcome him with open arms.

I shall get in touch with you in the beginning of January to finalize the 
arrangements for your trip and our meeting at Stanford.

Vince

Hello Vince and Stinson,

First of all,

BEST WISHES FOR HAPPY HOLIDAYS!!!!

If you are in the Stanford area during the holidays, let's get together
some time to have dinner.

I have formally established the project - thanks again for funding
it - and I have also recruited the second PhD student. His name is
Eric Cope, and he is a top-notch student, very mature, and entrepreneurial!

We have started working on some interesting problems in this area. I would
hope that Eric could spend the coming summer at Enron to get immersed into
the "problem/opportunity generation environment." That really helps the 
student
to develop a realistic vision about their research.

Perhaps, our whole team could visit Enron again some time in the next quarter,
say in March or so, to discuss the research issues we are pursuing. And of 
course
you could visit us before that too.


With my WARMEST WISHES,

Nick

Unfortunately, the faculty club is closed on Saturday.

I am looking forward to seeing you on Saturday. Shall
we meet at the Terman ground floor lobby at 11:45?
I think the Packard building is locked on Saturday.

I spoke with Paul Racicot, head of trading for  EBS, North America this 
morning.   He said that he is happy to send the $100,000 for your program 
from his budget.   I have forwarded to him the draft letter to accompany the

I would like to invite you to participate in a conference on "Retail
Participation in Competitive Power Markets" to be held at Stanford
University on June 21-22, 2001. Although California and other regional
markets will likely be introducing some demand-response programs by June,
there is a clear need for continual evaluation of these nascent efforts to
transform the market. The conference provides an opportunity to learn from
different experiences.

This policy research meeting will focus on establishing a foundation for
understanding the key concepts and methods for demand response programs and
to provide an opportunity for participants to raise questions and recommend
directions for additional research and analysis.  Participants will come
from companies, government, and universities.  You can obtain more
information about the conference by checking under "Meetings" on our EMF
website listed below.

Please let me know if you plan on attending.  Also, if you would like to
make a brief 15-minute presentation, please let me know your topic and
describe it in a few sentences.  I will try to choose speakers that will
cover the full range of interests represented by this group.  Researchers
should focus on the implications of their analysis for designing demand
response programs rather than on the technical details of their
methodology.  I would also encourage practitioners to discuss their
experience in implementing demand response programs or in raising selected
issues.

Thank you,
Hill Huntington

Hi Stinson,

I am under pressure from the Department to wrap up Giuseppe's RAship,
and I am probing to see how things are going on this matter on your
side. I'm deep in the red in terms of the deadline - way beyond it!
Would it be possible to wrap this up this week?

Many Thanks,

Nick,

The airport is about 30 minutes  by cab from the office (1400 Smith).
The best hotel is either Hyatt Regency Downtown or Doubletree 
Downtown (it is important to emphasize Downtown when making
reservations). The hotels are within a walking distance
from  the Enron building.

We can make reservations  for dinner around 6:30 - 7:00
in a resturant  within 10 minutes by car from the hotel.

By the way, we shall be very glad to reimburse you for the trip related 
expenses.

Vince

Yes, that would be ideal. But let me call first my travel agent to
see if there is a flight that would satisfy all the other
constraints. What time should I be at Enron on Thursday, and how far is
the airport from your offices?

Thanks,

Vince (and Shirley and Melinda),

Thanks so much for including me in this meeting with Stanford 
engineering---unfortunately, I'm committed to participate in the Enron Law 
Conference in San Antonio that entire day.

Thanks!

--Christie.

Dear Vince,

this is great news!  Donna and I are delighted that you have time to see us
on May 4th.

I'll be out of the office next week.  By copy of this email to my
assistant, Carol Lovell, I will ask her to get in touch with Shirley for
scheduling as well as directions on where to meet you.  We'll be glad to
meet with Christie Patrick as well.

Looking forward to meeting you,

Susan

Hello Vince, Stinson,

Thank you very much for hosting my visit at Enron. I had a
very pleasant time there, and I found the meetings very
informative.

As discussed during my visit at Enron, I am sending you below
a DRAFT of the letter that would be needed to get the program
in place and rolling, and start the students working on it.
It took a while to find out what the appropriate process was
and how the letter should be structured. Sorry for the delay.

If I may, I'd like to visit Enron again, sometime in August,
to define the research agenda more precisely and prioritize
the problems to look at. I'm in frequent contact with Giuseppe,
who is impressed by the environment there. We are trying to formulate
the research issues and problems to study, that would be of interest
to Enron.  The plan is this:

1) By August, Giuseppe will have been there for almost 2 months
and will probably have a relatively good understanding of the Enron problem
space.

2) I will work together with Giuseppe till August to formulate a set of
good problems of:
a) high practical importance
b) high innovation potential
c) serious scope.

3) I could  visit in August (say mid-August or so) to:
a) discuss these problems with you and get your feedback
b) prioritize the problems and evaluate their impact
c) make sure we're on the same page regarding research strategy
and execution path.

I hope we can fully set up the program at Stanford before then, so
that I can bring on board one more Ph.D. student to start his
doctoral work in this area.

I'm all excited about our collaboration. I am even thinking of
starting a research seminar at Stanford, specifically on these
research issues!

Talk to you soon.
Best Regards,

Nick

Dear Nick,

We are happy to provide gift funds of $100,000 per year, over
three years, to support a program in your research group, related
to Bandwidth Markets/Trading and Networking Technologies.

Enron would like to support research activities in the above
mentioned area, including Pd.D. student work, research seminars etc.
There may also be opportunities to have the supported Ph.D. students
do summer internships at Enron, related to their research interests.

Please find enclosed a check of $100,000 payable to Stanford University
for supporting this research effort in your group during the first year.


Best Regards,

Darrell,

Grant Masson, Ronnie Chahal and myself made a contribution to the book
on energy derivatives to be published soon in Australia (a book by
Clewlow and Strickland).

Given our growing workload and responsibilities, the quality of the paper is 
less
than satisfactory. I would like to make sure that there are no obvious and
embarrassing  errors in what we submit. I would appreciate if you could 
take a quick look at the chapter and give us the feedback (under the same
arrangement as in the previous cases).

Thanks for looking at our storage model. I shall give you a call within the
next few days to update you on our work and developments at Enron.
Vince will start his senior year in 6 weeks. He wants to graduate and look
for work: he thinks getting an advanced degree in his field makes
no economic sense. He spent the summer building his
own computer (1000 MHz clock speed). I was the unskilled immigrant worker
toiling under his management.

I hope everything is well at home and that your wife's company is doing great.

Regards.

Vince

Vince,

  I'll have him e-mail you a CV.

  I'd be happy to speak at the POWER RISK conference.
